		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=309,  ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I just want to start off by saying that 'Ghost In The Shell' loves to asks it's audience questions. What is it that makes us human? Is it the soul (refered to as 'ghosts' in this film)? Or is it flesh and bone? What happens when your memories can be erased and replaced like music on your iPod? If your body is entirely mechanical, can you still call yourself human? If your consciousness is active, yet your body is nowhere to be found, do you still exist?\nOkay, I'm giving myself a headache. Let's get to the review.\nStory\nCyborg cops battle an anonymous super-hacker who takes control\n          \n        of people's computerized brains and forces them to do his bidding. It's a wicked sci-fi thriller, yet it's also so much more. Not only is it a refreshingly original take on the standard Cops vs Criminals plot, but it manages to do it in such an intelligent manner. At it's core, the movie asks the audience 'What is it that makes us Human?' Although it never truly finds an answer (can anyone?), it gets closer to it than any other film has yet dared to go. The best part is, with all the philosphical, existentialist and technical chatter, it never really tries to beat the audience over the head with it. Many of the 'big questions' are handled in subtle ways that keep the pace of the film going, while still making the audience think. 'Ghost In The Shell' is cyberpunk at it's best.\nArt\nGitS came out in 1995 and still the visuals can compete with current animation standards. This film has aged extremely well. The action is wicked, every scene is full of atmosphere thanks to well detailed backgrounds, and the limited CGI is well integrated, even in such an early stage of CG animation. Yet the most astonishing part of the art is not the quality of the animation, or the artwork. It's the level of thought and polish that went into creating the look and feel of this film. As an exemple: There is a scene where the heroine, Motoko, is fighting a criminal while wearing a suit that makes her invisible. Even though she is invisble, we can still see her shadow. This is because her invisbility is only an optical illusion. There is still a solid mass blocking the light. It's little details like this one that make the visuals so incredible and, more importantly, believable.\nSound\nThe sounds of the film remain on the same high level as the art. Gunfire, ricochets, explosions, and even all the little computer noises are crisp and well implemented. The music is also quite fitting and original ('Making of a Cyborg', played during the opening credits, is one example). My only gripe is the voice actors are not at their best in this film (of course I mean the english cast). I greatly dislike Motoko's voice (Mimi Woods) and would much prefer Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, who voiced her in pretty much every other GitS project. The rest of the cast is the same as it is in current GitS projects, but you can tell they weren't as skilled as they are today. Still, they are quite good and it by no means ruins the film.\nCharacter\nThough all the characters had aspects that made them interesting, Motoko is really the star of the show here and is the only character who developped over the course of the film. Of course, the direction in which her character went more than makes up for this fact. Throughout the whole film she is struggling with the thought of losing her humanity due to being a cyborg, and it all leads up to an incredible finale that just leaves you in awe.\nEnjoyment\nNow, I'm giving it a 10 for enjoyment, but with an asterix. I personally loved this movie to death due to just how intelligent it is. Unfortunately, it is not an easy film to get into. Very little time is taken to explain how the GitS universe works. For example: The opening scene has Motoko speaking telepathically with Batou, who's nowhere to be scene. The film never really takes the time to explain how this is done, but you do manage to draw your own conclusions once you get your first glimpse of a cyberbrain. Unfortunately, much of the film relies on just how quickly the audience can put together the little details of the world and storyline. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can make things needlessly complicated and actually alienate viewers who may not have the patience to put together the pieces of this techno-puzzle. Luckily, the principle story is simple enough, and the action is good enough so that viewers can still have fun with it. Basically, it can leave you feeling pretty stupid, but you still pat yourself on the back for seeing it through to the end. And don't be surprised if you want to watch it a second time.\nOverall\nWith great action and an intelligent narative, 'Ghost In The Shell' is a classic. It inspired 'The Matrix', and anyone who has seen that film will know how great of a compliment that is. If you're into philosophical discussions about the soul and the consequences of technological evolution, see this film. If you just want to see a bunch of cyborg cops shooting stuff up, see this film. You will not be disapointed.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=237,  ["text"]="                          \n    I didn't read any manga or anything about the Ghost in the Shell world prior to watching, so that may have influenced my enjoyment. I'm aware of the fact that this is an intellectual and philosophical movie, and not one that focuses on bombastic explosions and violence. No, this is a movie driven by concept, a concept that is shown, not told, in a slow, vague approach that requires attention, thought, and patience. Yet, despite the effort needed to fully understand the film, it offers a surprisingly simple and disappointing payoff.\nThis is a movie that did not provoke thinking or cause me to question my\n          \n        existence or my self worth as a human being, it just wasn't complex or deep enough to change my views on humanity, and instead the topics it brought up seemed obvious to me. This is a movie that tackles human existence on a purely scientific level, which essentially boils it down to a simple fact: that our consciousness, memories, and emotions are merely created from electrical pulses within our brains. Humanity is separated into two parts, our consciousness and our physical body. For us, technology hasn't reached a point where these things that make us distinctly unique can be controlled and artificially replicated. The fact that we can't lends upon contemporary humans a certain sacredness to our existence, to birth, to life, and to our intelligence. The moment technology crosses that barrier, what makes us human will no longer be special or unique. This technological barrier is something that has already been crossed in the GITS universe, and with it, they decide to squander the potential of the setting, and only ask one question: What is a difference between man and machine? \nAt some point, there really is no practical difference, and ultimately, this is the answer the movie provides, and disappointingly, this is the only answer it provides with very little elaboration.\nWhat truly scares me, would be if humans will be responsible enough to guide us on the correct path of evolution once we become powerful enough to control it ourselves. Will society be destroyed by the folly of man when we obtain the power of \"god\"? Or will we evolve into a more advanced species? Will humanity be willing to throw away the primitive identity of what makes us human for the sake of transcending into a higher organism? How will society compete in a world where cybernetic parts are far superior to the organic ones we are born with? How can we trust anyone or anything, how would we know what is real and what is not once our memories and senses can be completely replaced?\nThis movie sort of touches a serious topic, when hackers steal the memories of others for personal gain. This is to show that a human's soul can be modified, just like a program, and it is a situation that is only presented in response to the movie's central, existential question. But besides this the movie doesn't touch any remotely serious topic at all, and most of the movie spends it's time focusing on needlessly building upon a rather pointless existential crisis sort of thing. Because the movie ignored addressing actually important and very real issues future technology will impose on humanity, the movie simply fell flat to me. The setting was immersive and well made, and the story had potential to go a different and much more interesting route. But instead, it took a very simplistic philosophical approach and made it needlessly convoluted.\nThe setting and atmosphere of the world, as well as the artwork of the city were very beautiful and interesting. The music was very fitting as well. But besides that I did not find anything I enjoyed.\n        "},

If you watched the original Matrix and went 'Holy Jesus this is the most amazing movie i've ever seen IN MY LIFE' then Ghost in the Shell will dropkick you in the face. Seriously.\nStory: This is the kind of stuff that university essay could be written about.  I'm going to have to watch this again just to completely understand everything about this movie.  Now, just so you understand, the storyline isn't amazing.  But the science and the mythology this anime is based on is so incredible.  I believe,\n          \n        according to a few sources, that if you took all the footnotes in the manga they total to over 30 pages.  Or was it 200?  The point is that the science that's used in this movie is absolutely amazing.\nArt: The art is old.  The art is...Akira old.  It's very old, but the details that are in it are incredibly amazing.  The art is old but it doesn't seem stale.  It's that good kind of old....classic.  They used some really cool effects in here...especially when some people turned invisible.  Oh..major plot hole if anyone notices...there's a guy who turns invisible...with all of his clothes on.  Whereas the girl....needs to strip naked...which she does QUITE often.  The nudity in this is tastefully done...it's not like Elfen Lied (no offense) where Nyu shows her boobs every couple of scenes.\nSound: Oldschool.....classic.\nCharacter: There is major character development for two characters.  Batou and the Major.  No one else really gets developed too much.  Sometimes they'd show you a character who did one thing and then you'd never see them again ever.  I'm not complaining too much, it never bugged me at all.  But you do get a real sense of humanity from these characters...that's a funny thing to say though, if you watch the anime you'll figure out why.\nEnjoyment: I guarantee that almost anyone who enjoys anime will also enjoy this.  Anyone who liked the Matrix will enjoy this.   It's an incredibly amazing anime, it's deep, it's slightly frightening.  The single thing that this anime does not have is comic relief...never once did I laugh.  Never once did I actually want to laugh.  This movie is so serious that if any attempt was made at making it slightly funny the attempt would surely fail.\nSeriously, go...watch this anime right now, and I promise...that you will not be disappointed.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=114,  ["text"]="                          \n    I took the time watching the highly acclaimed Ghost in the Shell, which is pretty famous for its philosophical and thought-provoking themes.\nThe story is set in a futuristic world where cyber-hacking exists, and one can control a person's actions through hacking their brains with an element known as \"ghost\". The film moves on a very slow pace almost throughout, alas a key factor in one deciding to drop it midway.\nThe script is the weak point of the movie. It it too short and it fails to explain just what is going on in this movie. It starts well, it has great pacing and it builds\n          \n        nicely, but then it grinds to a halt about midpoint and it never gets going again. \nThe main premise of the movie remains unexplained: just what is a ghost and how does somebody hack into it? Are all humans cyborgs? Do they all have artificial bodies? Or just a few?\nOn a deeper level, the script tries to touch on a more interesting problem: what exactly do humans feel, if you take away their body? Are they still humans? Or something else? Are they still capable of love and devotion?\nThe music is great. The theme is haunting, it is surprising and quite stirring. It also complements very well the images on the screen.\nGhost in the Shell has some of the best animation I've ever seen, and the character designs really fit the story. There are moments when the camera simply stops in place, lost in a long contemplation, as people go in and out of the picture. There is also the use of water as a mirror, reflecting the reality above, around and beyond it. \nThe action scenes are well done, and during dialogues the camera has a way of focusing on the person who listens, not on the one who is talking, which may be confusing, at first, but then it becomes quite interesting. The camera moves a lot, and the director makes a point out of filling in the entire space around the characters.\n20 years on after releasing, the art is still top notch and packs a punch. It might a bit dated by today's standards, maybe, but still very well done. The characters are interesting, and the surroundings are full of small, fine touches, of which some may seem like a little far-fetched, at first, but they all add to the atmosphere of the movie. The action sequences are also well done, but there's only a couple of them and they're short-lived. Then we're stuck with another long sequence of events which add-up to little. \nIn the end, I come back asking myself just what is Ghost in the Shell? The answer to that is that it's a good action anime, that develops a midlife crisis."},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=66,   ["text"]="                          \n    So I finally saw this movie. I've seen both seasons of Stand Alone Complex, Solid State Society, and Innocence, but I hadn't seen the original until now. And you know what? I'm kind of disappointed.\nSTORY - The central plot and concept is fine. As a cyberpunk fan, I think the human/machine divide is a fascinating topic that should be touched on more often and that Ghost in the Shell treats the subject well for the most part. Unfortunately, the storytelling and pacing in the movie is downright terrible. Sure, the movie's more than a decade old by now, but storytelling isn't really something that changes\n          \n        with time -- people have been telling stories for as long as they've existed, so I won't buy age as an excuse for all the awkward silences, scenes that were way too long, and scene transitions that didn't make sense. The political mishaps felt a little haphazard and garbled, but that wasn't really the important part so I didn't care all that much.\nThe important part was Kusanagi's story and inner conflict, which was allowed one dream-like underwater scene followed by an oddly tension-filled conversation that ended abruptly without explanation. It wasn't obvious enough to me that she was deeply disturbed by the prospect of her ghost having artificial origins, and it annoyed me a little that they never directly explained what a ghost was even though I guess most people would be able to deduce it from context clues. Instead of putting in more scenes that fleshed out the characters or even the political situation they were in, we got five minute montages of the futuristic cityscape that contributed little more than eyecandy. I like eyecandy as much as the next person, and I love city backgrounds in particular, but I don't want my story sacrificed for it.\nCHARACTER - Motoko Kusanagi should be a multi-faceted and complex character. She should be a capable leader with strong relationships with her team members, and despite her strong and independent exterior, she should be questioning her place in society, her origins, and her future. Those are the things that the Major should be, but I only got vague impressions of all of those points in this movie. I really felt like there could have been so much more to it if they had only spent more time on developing her character instead of whatever else they were doing. Her intelligence didn't seem as important as her strength, and her relationship with Batou didn't feel particularly natural or realistic. It was very frustrating to watch.\nAnd if Kusanagi wasn't fleshed out, then of course Batou (or as the credits seem to say, 'Bateau'?) hardly was. We saw very little of him on his own, which I guess makes sense in that the movie isn't about him, but I feel like his relationship with the Major is important enough to warrant a bit more attention, y'know? I felt like we needed more of his opinions on technology, cybernetics, and I dunno... the theme of the movie? But he was just a flat support character. Why did he care so much about Kusanagi? Beats me! Aramaki and Togusa are even further down the chain -- very little elaboration beyond their positions in Section 9. What did either of them think about the human/machine divide? Who knows?\nARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - Cityscapes and waterscapes? Drop dead gorgeous. Interior building and laboratory designs? Nice. Gigantic machines and implementations of future technology? Wonderfully detailed. Weapons and vehicle design? Kickass. Oh, did I mention that all the action is excellent? The environment in Ghost in the Shell is really amazing looking, and it seems obvious to me that that's where they spent most of their time and energy in this movie. The character animation was pretty standard, but I did notice a lot of stillframes. It's a cheap trick to have digital thought communication and not animate lips moving, but I usually buy that. But here, in addition to that, there was also an over-abundance of panning shots, closeups, and other corner-cutting tactics. \nIt also really bothered me that Kusanagi's eyes seemed utterly lifeless and inexpressive the entire movie. Yes, she's a cyborg, but the point is to retain as many human qualities as possible -- even Batou seemed more expressive than she did and he doesn't even have (human-like) eyes. \nMUSIC - I really love Kenji Kawai's work, so it's no surprise that I really like the music in Ghost in the Shell. Chanting and traditional Japanese instruments juxtaposed with a future teeming with technology just has an eerie quality to it. Since I did see Innocence before this original movie, I thought a lot of it seemed really similar, which I guess is a good thing? It's nice to see parallels between related things, even if it's just as simple as the music.\nVOICE ACTING - Oh, god. I saw this dubbed. No one but Mary Elizabeth McGlynn should ever voice Motoko Kusanagi. In comparison, Mimi Woods's portral is bland, stereotypical, and just too... girlish? It was utterly bizarre for me to hear certain inflections in her speech, and after a while, I just tried to imagine everything Kusanagi said in McGlynn's voice instead (with only minimal success). Naturally, having seen all the other incarnations of Ghost in the Shell dubbed before I saw this movie makes me biased against Woods because I like McGlynn's portral so much -- would I have liked it better if I had actually seen this first? I really can't know.\nThankfully, both Batou and Aramaki had their SAC/Innocence voice actors already for the original movie. I haven't written a review for SAC, but it's worth mentioning that I think it's one of the best English dubs ever. All of those voices just fit so nicely. Their emotions and most of all, their personalities, are portrayed perfectly, and it's really great listening to them. Like Kusanagi, Togusa also had a different voice actor here, but while it still isn't up to par with his SAC/Innocence voice actor, it's not that bad.\nOVERALL - Despite all the disappointments, I still think Ghost in the Shell has merit as a classic. Even though the storytelling was poor and the characters underdeveloped, the core theme of the movie wasn't lost. It took a while to get there, but the Puppetmaster's dialogue did clearly present the topic of a human mind with mechanical origins, and Kusanagi's actions did eventually reveal her inner turmoil over that idea. That idea is probably the only thing worth taking away from the movie though... and maybe some of those pretty backgrounds too. If you're like me and have seen everything related to Ghost in the Shell except for this movie, I'd go ahead and see it just for the sake of seeing. If you've not seen anything else Ghost in the Shell and are just curious, I'd recommend Stand Alone Complex first. You can dig up the history after you decide you like the series. :P\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=57,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Story- 9/10\nPuppet Master: ‘’And can you offer me proof of your existence? How can you, when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is?’’\nThe story and themes present in Ghost in the Shell (GitS) are both striking and very relevant. GitS takes place in a more than possible future world where cybernetics and AI have become a social norm. The amazing detail given to the universe and the true to life reflection of today’s society makes the themes in question incredibly applicable. The different opinions in GitS are argued with a certain potency and precision. The maturity and skill of the characters in\n          \n        putting across their arguments will encourage the viewer to contemplate these ‘philosophical’ issues from a very serious stance. \nThe ‘main’ story (when I say main, it is really just an excuse to bring up these themes, which are the focus) isn’t so revolutionary in terms of originality but is definitely very intelligent. A mysterious master hacker, known as the puppet master has been causing some negative repercussions in the political world of GitS. Section 9 has thus been asked to investigate. This can be seen as nothing more than the story of an extended and very standard TV episode. And to an extent, you can’t argue with that. But rather than witnessing the usual, ‘’-enemy is introduced, -enemy makes their move, [*good guys then find a way to defeat this enemy*], -enemy apprehended’’ sort of arc, the story unfolds in a very intelligent manner. The movie uses this particular case to initially explore interesting notions in the GitS universe, such as social inequality, the soul or ‘ghost’ of a robot and corrupt politicians. The story’s themes will then take over and the resulting dialogue leads to some very interesting ideas. Overall, it is a very smart and engaging version of what would’ve otherwise had been a standard plot. \nThe only ‘flaw’ in the story of the movie is that it assumes you to have at least a basic knowledge of the GitS universe. Whilst there isn’t anything vital you need to know, the huge amount of detail and history can be too much to take in at times. If anything, (if you are a fan of cyberpunk/ sci-fi) this should just inspire you to learn more about the complex universe. Do not worry about being new to the universe; just have your thinking cap on. \nSound/ art- 10/10\nThe art and soundtrack in GitS are ground-breaking. A new method of animation at the time used for the film was basically designed to create a sense of depth in the different levels of animation. This resulted in some amazingly detailed backgrounds and city views. Beauty is in the detail, and with so much detail, you are really able to become fully immersed into the universe before you. The art style is basically a timeless example of how to animate a mature and intelligent film like GitS. For example, the opening credits was just converted computer code used in a creative way. It was lovely to see this clear, harmonious language between the universe and the media used to portray it. The art and soundtrack was so inspiring, that in the film are a series of scenes that are entirely composed of visuals of the city backed by a brilliant OST. I couldn’t help but smile in awe at the level of detail and beauty. \nCharacters- 8/10\nThis is an unfair section to mark a single film on, when in reality GitS just follows on from two whole series of character development. In reality, you can watch the film without watching the TV series’.  This is sadly due to the fact that you never really see the characters personalities in the film. They just operate as speakers for the themes in the film. Despite this, the cast are able to deliver these arguments with great effect because of their own maturity and strength of character. \nEnjoyment-10/10 \nGhost in the Shell is an all-time classic. As mentioned, I absolutely love the detail in the universe. I want to become immersed, and I can very easily become immersed thanks to the soundtrack and artwork. You cannot help but admire what you are watching. In terms of action, GitS certainly knows how to deliver. Although not an action led film, the two action scenes actually featured are nothing short of masterpieces. There was a mixture of technology, well-choreographed combat and intense build ups. All backed up by a great atmosphere. Having all of this done in such a mature style enabled me to take everything that much more seriously which made the arguments far more engaging. \nOverall-9/10\nAlthough released in 1995, the ideas presented in GitS are becoming more and more pertinent. The ground breaking media and level of detail in GitS has and will continue to inspire many films for years to come. I thoroughly recommend you to watch this film and I encourage you to look into the other GitS films and TV series’ that are equally as stunning."},

How can you, when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is?’’\nGhost in the Shell is an anime film adaptation of the cyberpunk manga of the same name by Masamune Shiro. Both the anime and manga have received critical praise for decades now and have built a strong fan base in Japan and the West alike. But while the manga is more comedic and light-hearted overall, the anime is much more serious and mature, with the film’s tone making it feel completely different from Shiro’s original work. Part of this is probably due\n          \n        to the director, Mamoru Oshii and if you haven’t heard of the name before, remember it because he is one of the most thought-provoking filmmakers the industry has ever seen (e.g. Angel’s Egg and Jin-Roh) and his work for Ghost in the Shell is another reason why he is held in such high regard. This film loves to ask the audience existential questions, with the simplest, yet deepest and most difficult to answer being “what makes us human?”\nThroughout the film, the protagonist Major Motoko Kusanagi asks herself this while working for Section 9, a public security agency run by a group of cybernetically enhanced cops who are tracking down a notorious hacker known only as the Puppetmaster. The movie is set in the year 2029 in a Hong Kong-inspired city where the world has been overrun by a vast network that controls every aspect of one’s life and where people having cybernetic enhancements is very common. Motoko however, has a body which is completely cybernetic, which is referred to as a “Shell”. Due to technological advancements, the definition of being human has been altered; a “Ghost” is what differentiates a human being from a robot, hence the title “Ghost in the Shell”.  \nBecause this movie takes place in the future, these are also advancements that have been made in regards to weaponry and military purposes. Concealment and usage of these advancements are executed exceptionally well, even at the beginning of the film. Therm-optic camouflage allows users to become totally invisible and is used heavily throughout the film by both Motoko and her enemies to escape and, in Motoko’s case, another way to kick ass. The guns that are used are able to destroy fully armoured tanks in a matter of seconds. And the way Motoko uses these weapons in battles further demonstrates how mature this film is. Ghost in the Shell as a series overall focuses on tension and strategic build-up before quick bursts of intense action rather than the kind of long, drawn out battles full of action that you’d be more likely to see in a long-running shounen. Ghost in the Shell makes those action scenes feel more important and reduce the amount of unnecessary choreography in these scenes, making every move made feel important and has reason behind it. Even the last battle with Motoko and the walking tank has no wasted movement by Motoko, as any false move could very well cause her death. \nIt’s also worth noting that even having a complete cybernetic enhanced body does not make one invincible. One can still die in the universe of Ghost in the Shell just as easily in real life, but what’s different is that with cybernetic enhancements, one’s sense of pain is lost to their enhanced part/s. From this, one can push their cybernetic body to their breaking point and cause their enhancements to break, whereas without them, such a scenario wouldn’t be physically possible. The amount to detail that went into cybernetic technology alone in this film is nothing short of amazing. These ideas are all fleshed out in the short duration this film has and makes the world of Ghost in the Shell more realistic that it’s possible that this could be our future.\nThere are also practical drawbacks from these advancements; a human can easily be ghost hacked, meaning that their mind can be erased and filled with completely different memories. This is touched upon when Motoko’s partner Batou states that “all the information that a person accumulates in a lifetime is just a drop in the bucket.” While the movie is aimed primarily at self-identification, it also looks at the unintended creation of new life forms, such as what would happen if a program from the internet could become self-aware and escape into the world we all live in, and the dangers that would have on us. It even deals with genetic manipulation, with how combining multiple sets of DNA to form one set that share the greatest features from each set, yet is fundamentally different from all of them. It’s no surprise that Ghost in the Shell is a very complex film when it comes to the subject matter, but the film never tries to shove all these concepts down the viewer’s throat. Many of the deep questions it asks are done in such a subtle way that doesn’t impact the pacing of the show, yet keeps viewers looking deep into the film always thinking. The film plays out more like a sci-fi thriller that keeps viewers both intrigued and entertained. \nI’ve talked so much on the overall story and themes and yet I haven’t even begun to talk about the film’s animation, which is another one of its strengths since it was made in 1995 and over 2 decades still looks spectacular. Characters move fluidly in action scenes especially, every scene has a sense of atmosphere from backgrounds used, limited CGI that fits the look and feel the overall movie has and a keen eye for detail was clearly present. Every scene has something there that grabs the viewer’s eyes and keeps the viewers engaged even if they do get bored at some points. The level is detail is so high, that in a scene when Motoko is using thermo-optic camouflage, her shadow can still be seen, implying that her camouflage is an optical illusion, to put it simply. The film also has an artistic side to it as the opening shows us the making of a cyborg, more specifically Motoko herself and montages of the futuristic city are shown throughout the film, showing how advancements made over time have impacted the Hong Kong-inspired setting. Even the nudity within this film is rather symbolic and never meant to be taken sexually by viewers. \nThe soundtrack for this film is also amazing with very gripping music from Kenji Kawai that adds to the mystique of the world and at times even feels creepy because of how well it fits with the atmosphere, with “Making of a Cyborg” being one of my favourite OST’s of all time. My only issue with the sound would be the English voice actors, Mimi Wood especially (voiced Motoko) I found very unlikeable and it didn’t help with scenes that were dialogue heavy that involved her. But they were still pretty good and didn’t hinder my enjoyment of the film. The other main issue I had with the fil overall was the characters. Obviously, Motoko is the star of the show and her internal struggle of losing her humanity throughout the film is part of why she’s my favourite female anime character as I am writing this. However, she’s the only character who gets any real development over the course of the film. Batou and the Puppetmaster are the only other characters worth anything in the film overall, with the rest of Section 9 feeling unimportant and replaceable. Now I understand the staff can only do so much with a movie that lasts 82 minutes and they’ve already gone beyond what I believe was expected of them, but I just wish that the film was longer, if only to put more emphasis on the characters.\nOverall, Ghost in the Shell is a very enjoyable sci-fi flick on the surface, that underneath lies a very mature and complex movie that doesn’t waste any time, and if you don’t pay attention, it will be hard to understand it at all. It’s very clever in how it leaves you in wonder and keeps you thinking about it afterwards, which in my opinion adds to its rewatch value. This film is excellent and should be a must-watch for every anime fan out there. It is not only one of the best anime movies out there, but one of the best science fiction movies that I’ve ever seen as well, up there with the likes of The Matrix and Blade Runner."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="                          \n    When many hear the word “anime”, they’ll often think of over the top battles, ridiculously muscle-bound men, unrealistically voluptuous women, and fantastical settings. They think of a medium which exists to provide escapism. However, while there is nothing fundamentally wrong with escapism or any of the things I just mentioned, this notion is a false one. Anime is a medium with as much diversity as film, literature, music and any other entertainment medium you can think of and, like those mediums, it is capable of more than just entertainment; it is capable of producing genuine art. Works that question the human condition, the meaning of\n          \n        life, the nature of morality and other pertinent questions that continue to remain relevant long after they are released. One such work is Mamoru Oshii’s magnum opus Ghost in the Shell, an adaptation of Masamune Shirow’s drastically different manga of the same name. It is a film that has often been regarded as being one of the absolute essentials for anyone getting into anime, and for good reason. \nThe film revolves around a government organization by the name of Section 9, comprised of both humans and cyborgs, as they pursue an elusive hacker known as The Puppet Master. However, this isn’t the narrative’s main focus as it explores themes of transhumanism, existentialism and individuality through its well realized setting, in which the line between man and machine has become blurred. People can replace their bodies with cybernetic prosthetics and even place cybernetic implants in their brain. It uses concepts such as these to ask questions regarding the definition of humanity and this is done through thought provoking albeit heavy handed dialogue as well as through striking and memorable imagery, which also aids in evoking an eerie and captivating atmosphere. \nThat’s not to say the film only delivers in that regard though, as I’d be remiss not to mention the absolutely stellar action scenes. They are excellently choreographed and, in spite of the fact that they are animated, they have a very realistic feel to them.\nThe characters are also an absolute treat, as aspects of their characters help reinforce the themes of the story. The highlight is definitely the protagonist, Motoko Kusanagi. She’s intelligent, resourceful and empowered, which was a welcome change from the damsels in distress that plagued a lot of anime at the time and her existential crisis is both engaging and subtle, aided by ingenious choices on the part of the director. \nOther notable characters include Batou, who plays a pivotal role in Kusanagi’s development and can be regarded as her foil, Tougusa, a human with very few cybernetic enhancements who aids in reinforcing the film’s core theme of the nature of humanity, and the aforementioned Puppet Master, who I won’t talk about much for fear of spoiling it. That being said, their identity is brilliantly foreshadowed early on in the film and their motivations are also thematically pertinent to the story. \nThe film also looks spectacular. The sheer amount of detail given to the backgrounds is jaw-dropping and the animation is arguably better than a lot of the stuff coming out today. The character designs are also something to behold due again to the amount of detail. Couple this with Oshii’s brilliant direction and you’ve got yourself something utterly beautiful. The soundtrack is also wonderful as Kenji Kawai’s eerie and atmospheric score complements the film perfectly. One can even listen to the tracks outside of the movie and be spellbound. \nOverall Ghost in the Shell is an incredible artistic achievement as well as an absolutely quintessential film for all anime fans and for fans of film in general."},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=27,   ["text"]="                          \n    “If you don’t know where you’re from, then you don’t know where you are, and you don’t know where you’re going.” It’s a clichéd if truthful saying, especially for this film. Well, sort of. This film knows where it’s going, but it doesn’t know how to get there, it doesn’t know where it is, and it doesn’t know where it’s from. This film is a voice pining to speak, but it studders at every word.\nSo where does this leave Ghost in the Shell? Read on to find out.\nIn the year 2029, cybernetic technology has strengthened the human body and connected the human mind. Barriers have\n          \n        been broken as people can access the Internet with just their body alone. But with this new tech, comes cyber criminals looking to exploit it, and Section 9, a group tasked with stopping cyber criminals. One criminal, the Puppet Master, is skilled enough to hack the human mind. As Section 9 works to track him down, his very existence will challenge the idea of what it means to be human.\nThis is because almost every member of Section 9 is cybernetically enhanced. They’re basically super soldiers, with abilities far beyond even what most civilians can do. But at the same time, they’re just as vulnerable as anyone else. If a cybernetically enhanced person is hacked, their memories can be deleted or they can be fooled into believing a false life. Even then, their bodies need maintenance, and a system failure on that end would mean going back to their old shells or returning to dust. The story is basically used to explore what it means to be human.\nBut Ghost in the Shell explores these themes with as much discipline as an undisciplined soldier. Sometimes the themes are used believably, like with Motoko or Togusa’s dialog with the captured criminals after the garbage truck chase scene. Or Section 9’s dialog in Daisuke’s office about something they discovered. These scenes are believable because it raises the questions the film wants to ask, without letting them become heavy, so the plot still moves forward.\nAt other times, the theme use is cringeworthy. The last dialog from the Puppet Master shows an evolutionary tree several times, with the most roundabout way of saying “I want to evolve.” Or the boatside dialog between Motoko and Batou, where the former switches from soldier to philosopher at the drop of a hat, with deep water metaphors abound. There is actually a point where the second scene takes Batou’s point of view, giving the effect of Motoko talking to the viewer. Seriously.\nSeriously. The film wants to be thought provoking, but doesn’t know how to express itself. At some points it expresses itself quietly, letting scarce dialog and a lot of plot progress imply questions for its viewers. At other times, the questions are loudly overplayed, hitting viewers over the head and grinding the plot to a halt. The story itself, for all the international conspiracy it involves, is underplayed. But that’s not a problem, since it’s just a vehicle for the themes the film tries to convey.\nToo bad then, that said vehicle breaks down several times throughout the film. For minutes on end, the plot is road blocked by scenes of Motoko being cybernetically enhanced, random scenes of the city, and scenes of the military getting ready. But only the military scenes resemble story progress. The city scenes don’t progress the story, and Motoko’s scene would have worked as part of her background, but becomes pointless when later scenes explain it anyway. Time spent on these montages should have been used smoothing out character progress.\nMost of the characters themselves have the same personality (military badass), making them hard to tell apart. Some background can help to tell them apart, but most of them are undeveloped on that end too, or share the same background anyway (“we’re all cybernetically enhanced”). This only leaves character progress to save its cast, but the result is like a failed military mission. And the one who takes the most casualties from this is Motoko.\nMotoko has the most progress in the film, but it comes in chunks and lacks sincerity. Spending most of the film being a military badass, peppered with scenes FILLED with philosophical rambling, or worry over Section 9’s discovery, simply doesn’t compute. It lacks a middle ground to bridge the opposite sides of her personality, so it’s hard to believe her as the same person. Character progress should be steady, not sudden. The only one with steady progress is Batou.\nBatou starts as a military badass, whose humanity slowly shows itself as the film goes on. During the boatside dialog, the viewer can get a sense of why Batou tagged along with Motoko when she’s changing out of her swimwear. During the dialog in Daisuke’s office, Batou casually tells Togusa why a recent discovery is a sore spot for Section 9. And during the last scenes, Batou’s emotions finally boil over in the end confrontation with the Puppet Master.\nAnd speaking of confrontation, there’s the actions scenes in the film, and by extension, the film’s aesthetics. The animation is fluid, but the art design itself is grimy and imperfect. There’s a sense that every street in the city has been lived in, that characters have worn out their outfits, that colors lack any life to them. It’s not pretty, but then again, a crime that can invade the mind itself wouldn’t be pretty. The visuals have an organic look despite the high-tech setting and being computer generated, making them more impressive.\nThe action scenes themselves are quiet, forgoing actual music in favor of bone-crunching sound effects. The ground crunches when Motoko drops from a large height, and gun shots are the only melody during action-packed symphonies. Some of the scenes, like a criminal’s leg being twisted, or the snapping of Motoko’s arms when she’s trying to open an army tank, can be hard to watch. But that just goes with the gritty feel the film tries—and succeeds—to give.\nThere IS actual music, a haunting, choir-like piece. But it’s used in the montages that do almost nothing for the story, making for a nice but pointless soundtrack. Time spent on those montages should have been used to smooth out character progress. Even then, the story’s themes are believably used one moment, then without subtlety the next moment. Some viewers may wish the Puppet Master would delete their memories of wasting 82 minutes gawking at aesthetic wonders.\nNow, to say Ghost in the Shell is enjoyable with the viewer’s brain turned off, watching it for the underplayed story, and being wowed by the aesthetics is a reasonable stance. But that would be ignoring everything else the film tries to do, and for something trying to be thought provoking, it’s inexcusable. This film may be a smart Ghost, but the voice it leaves behind is only a Shell of what it could be.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=15,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Ghost in the Shell is without doubt my favourite anime movie ever released.\nWhere to begin? This thing is dense, because there's so much that happens in it from machiavellian political subterfuge, to incredible gunplay and vicious combat, and a mystery that opens up one of the biggest can of worms there is.\nThis is probably what cemented cyberpunk as a genre in anime, hitting harder than anything before and that's followed. High tech low lives, Ghost in the Shell is drowning in them. That isn't the biggest pull in the film, what really gets me is the questions it leaves you with:\nWhat are the differences between\n          \n        artificial intelligence and human consciousness? What happens when you merge the two, does that become something new? If your memories can be rewritten electronically, how can you be sure you are really yourself? When you can customise every part of your physical appearance, how can you remain an individual if you change entirely or something becomes identical to you?\nThis film was more than entertaining, it made me want to learn more about what it was talking about. If that isn't the sign of an incredible movie, what is?\nThroughout the whole film, it never feels overly preachy. Once you get into the rich story at the beginning, it all flows so (ironically) organically that the whole philosophy bits creep in subtly enough that its easy to digest, at least it did for me and I knew absolutely nothing about 'em. This is one of those films that gets more rewarding in the second or third viewing just because so much is going on at once. Every time I watch this movie, I think I love it even more. It was also great to see a really strong female lead character dealing with completely unpredictable situations, even if her clothes/swimsuit seems a bit out of place at a board meeting. Hey, that's anime for ya!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Recently a friend of mine came to me after watching the 1995 cyberpunk classic Ghost in the Shell and told me it was boring, overhyped, mediocre, and filled with meaningless long pauses in conversation. We argued for a while and, as arguments go, came to no middle ground. He could not understand why the film was so long with so little depth, why the female characters were continually nude, and why people give the movie such praise. He had a point with the nudity, but Ghost in the Shell is otherwise a meditative masterpiece with future-predicting themes that only become more plausible with time. I\n          \n        love this movie and have another watch-through of it every few months. It still has yet to lose its entertainment value for me.\nA lot of people take thorough issue with films and TV shows that use long pauses, denouncing it as “filler.”  From the recent Polish film Ida to the recent Japanese anime Aku no Hana, a large percentage of the audience bears hatred toward these works solely for the seemingly pointless pauses in both action and dialogue. Such a thing as a meditative film exists, and it’s a style that I tend to appreciate. The chance to stop and think about what you’re watching shouldn’t be a thing to be criticized. Being bombarded with non-stop dialogue, especially when it’s complex like it is in Ghost in the Shell, leaves the audience confused. I might even say that the whole climactic scene of Ghost in the Shell with the Major and the Puppet Master is too much to take in at once and should have been dealt with differently for the audience that, unlike me, won’t watch a movie over and over again throughout the years.\nThe rapid evolution of technology and the disregard towards artificial intelligence’s growth despite our constant warnings makes the setting of the Ghost in the Shell franchise less of a science fiction and more of a science prediction. I’ve heard many criticisms of Ghost in the Shell and its sequel Innocence focus on the lack of relatability to our current society. On the contrary, the Ghost in the Shell franchise focuses on the issues we’ll be going through in a few decades if not sooner. We should probably take a listen before it’s too late. Frankenstein predicted the organ transplant, 1984 predicted the excess of the NSA’s power, and even A Space Odyssey predicted the iPad. But we also had authors like Isaac Asimov and Philip K. Dick predicting the rise of this whole AI and interconnectedness thing. Ghost in the Shell is basically another Isaac Asimov novel, but in awesome atmospheric movie form and with more focus on the rise of the net. We’re right in the middle of what Asimov, Dick, and that Masamune Shirow fellow predicted. People actually developed a functioning android portrait of Philip K. Dick. Think about that.\nDespite even Stephen Hawking's and Bill Gates' warnings, Ghost in the Shell looks like an inevitable future. We've been fucked ever since that chess machine beat the professional chess player. So, enjoy the movie. And when the robots decide to fuck shit up, just remember Will Smith's line in that whacky but pretty cool iRobot adaptation, \"You know, somehow, 'I told you so' just doesn't quite say it.\" But stop milking this franchise, guys. Stand Alone Complex was more than enough, the fuck is with this Arise, this new movie, and this new Hollywood movie?\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=21,   ["text"]="                          \n    Based on the manga of the same name by Masamune Shirow, Ghost in the Shell is an account of a not-so-distant future when it’s not uncommon for you to walk on a busy street and bump into cyborgs— humans who have been ‘cyberized’ to such an extent that every aspect of their functioning is taken care of by high-tech equipment within their ‘shell’, the prosthetic body, and ‘ghost’ which is the slang term for consciousness. So what was it that you really bumped into? What is it that differentiates a human from a cyborg? What makes us human— the biological matter, the consciousness or the\n          \n        memories? These are the questions which Ghost in the Shell explores. On the surface, it’s a cybercrime story. Rapid progression of cybernetics has resulted in various complications, particularly ‘ghost hacking’.  Section 9, a unit of National Public Safety Commission of Japan, is responsible for dealing with such sensitive crimes. The protagonist is Major Kusanagi Motoko, a member of Section 9, whose body is almost entirely cyberized with the exception of her brain which is organic. With the aid of her co-workers, she must track down Puppet Master, an ingenious hacker.\nThe movie is an intricate piece of work with technical terms and phrases popping up every now and then. This makes it difficult to comprehend many parts of the movie and sometimes you have no clue what’s going on, especially if you’re watching it the first time and you don’t have at least a minimal knowledge of cybernetics and the like. However, if you watch it with enough focus, grasping the overall plot should not be that difficult.  Basically, you need to look at it as a reel of threads instead of trying to disentangle every intertwined thread if you’re a first time viewer of the movie. For an in-depth analysis, you may require to watch it a few more times until you’re contented enough. \nAlthough cyberpunk is the core, Ghost in the Shell also has several philosophical aspects.  Cyberization enables storage of memories in external devices like hard drives and consequently their sharing. You can share the memories of a party you went to with a friend— what you saw, what you heard and even the sensations you had. So, how would you define ‘reality’ in a world where accessing others’ memories is as simple as browsing through files and folders on your computer? How would you know that the memories you possess are ‘real’? Candidly speaking, you’re no longer your own master in such vulnerability. Keeping aside the philosophy, let’s move on to the other aspects of the movie. \nVisually, Ghost in the Shell is spectacular. Considering that the movie is more than a decade old now, the animation and graphics are noteworthy indeed. The action scenes are so well animated that they leave the viewers in awe. Not to mention, the backgrounds, machines, skyscrapers and other objects are really well detailed, rendering the movie what it is— a futuristic thriller. \nThere is not much to say about the audio.  The voice actors did a fine job, if not the best. The song ‘Making of a Cyborg’, a traditional Japanese chanting more or less that plays during the opening credits and a few other scenes give an uncanny feel to the movie and is in contrast to the ‘futuristic’ theme. \nTo wrap up, Ghost in the Shell is a classy sci-fi thriller that not only offers an insight into a  time when the line between man and machine constantly blurs but also provokes thoughts about what’s in store for us in the near future. It’s a must watch for every sci-fi fanatic out there. "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=20,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    I find \"Ghost in the Shell\" just as a concept AMAZING. The combination of the this idea of what  the world could be like in 2029 and the psychological game that this story plays as you move through the movie.\nSTORY:9/10\nI'm not going to lie, but after reading the synopsis for this movie i felt that i would be a classic group of bad ass special forces soldiers that hunt down the villain \"The Puppet Master\". But it is so much more than that!! This movie goes further, they don't just set this movie in the future just to display some cool future military tech(but\n          \n        i will say the future tech they do display is pretty bad ass). The entire plot revolves around that there are human cells in-planted into cybernetic bodies to give human consciousness to a robot (aka cyborgs). The stories main characters are in section 9, a military group that is mainly comprised of cyborgs.They use the cyborg bodies(shells) which are pushed at the audience to realize these cyborg bodies are not just tools but who the people are and its just one thing i am so glad the focused on in this movie. The question that this story also pushes but might be hard to catch for some viewers is \"what makes us human\". Around the middle of the movie Motoko talks to Batou and questions her own humanity after seeing Project 2501. This can later be resolved up towards the end of the movie when Motoko links with 2501 after which 2501 forcefully combines with Motokos ghost to create   one being(This confirms their qualities for basic life because their combination produce a new generic life form). This ending was something that I found both fascinating and never saw coming. Overall this story had so much information crammed into it that you will really need to be paying attention and rewatch it several times to get everything the movie attempts to deliver. The only flaw i could  point out in this story is that you will need more background knowledge than just the synopsis to enjoy it to its full potential. \nART/ANIMATION:10/10\nThe art in this show was easily an accomplishment. If you specifically pay attention to the landscapes and cyborg bodies there is an unbelievable amount of attention to detail which isn't just beautiful but also provides as a great atmospheric element to make you feel more immersed in the film and really reflects on how great the \"Ghost in the Shell\" universe is. Now the animation is one of the things that really shined for me when watching this film. The effects were outstanding and never had a dull moment. Great examples of the animation is when ever a bullet impacts a surface, when Mokoto apprehends the first criminal in the market, and the best of all when she pushes her cyborg body over the limit to stop the tank. Really no flaws in this department.\nSOUND:9/10\nThe music in this movie provided as another great atmospheric element and gave the film some character. Also if you pay attention to the voice actors they didnt just do a great job the mixers also did great by providing well done echo effects and other changes to the voices to really make them one with the show.\nCHARACTER:7/10\nThis is my lowest rated part of this anime and its kind of unfair in my opinion to even review it. The reason i say this is because the creators of this movie did an amazing job stuffing loads of quality content into a minuscule 83 minutes. But there is only so much you can do with 83 minutes and strong character development was not one of them. The only character that i was moderately attached to by the end of the movie was Mokoto but in my opinion that is still a achievement in my book because of everything else they movie had to offer.\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL:9/10\nThis was a movie that i could only describe by saying amazing. I am to this day pretty baffled about how the creators were able to fit so much quality into a small package for all to enjoy. There is so much content here and i have yet to see anything that really hits the sci-fi benchmark quite like this. The only thing that kept me from giving this movie a 10/10 was the simple fact that the movie was not long enough to do all the great things it did and provide good character development.\nSo i will end this review by saying if you haven't watch this yet i highly recommend it to anyone who likes anime or sci-fi genres but first try to get some background knowledge on the \"Ghost in the Shell\" universe. I would also recommend the other \"Ghost in the Shell\" works for they are also great productions in the same universe but not just to watch, these are must buys!! \nAs always thank you to everyone who took the time to read this review and have a good day.\n"},

This isnt a commercial product full of clichees and overused artstlye-types, its a beautiful masterpiece of art. But this anime is not made for everyone. It is made to appeal to mature audience, since the majority of anime ( and nearly ever recent made anime) is for teenagers or children, i would suggest you think about it twice before you just randomly start watching this anime, else you will just get confused.\nGhost in the shell shows a\n          \n        realistic description of an idea of the future with better technology, humans with cybernetic modifyed brains and an connection of brains over a huge network. And besides presenting you this amazing futuristic world in this movie many fundamental questions appear, like: \"Because DNA is just a code, which can be recreated artificially- is it possible for a robot to be a living person?\" or \"how can you define life?\". The world around GitS is very complexe and interesting, and will fascinate you in its own way, showing you not only the bright ideas of this future, but also its dirty sides, the 	criminality and its weak spots. You can connect the whole idea very much with the already existing internet, only in Ghost in the Shell a hacker targets humans rather than computer.\nStory 10/10: The story focuses around section 9, an anti-terror organisation of the gouverment trying to catch a brilliant hacker named \"the puppetmaster\". So at first it shows you some detective work finding out more about the main villain and later on you will get the ordinary package of combat and a big conclusion. Its made very solidly, but they used many details to make the story pretty complex. When you dont follow what everyone says exectly you will soon get lost in the story even though this anime is only 1,5 hours long and filled with action and philosophy as well. The story itself isnt even the main aspect of the show. I think the movie wanted to present the audience the storywriters personal idea of the futur and give you a bit of a lecture of his philosophy as a bonus. \nSound 10/10: With “making of cyborg” GitS had one of the best OSTs I have ever heard, because it is a very unique and rememberable theme with a combination of traditional Japanese instruments and voices. Mamoru Oshii really  knows how to use his soundtrack to give his audience goosebumps.\nArt 10/10: Ghost in the Shell impresses its audience with one of the most detailed backgrounds with very beautiful drawn skycrapers. The technical detail of the machines, weapons and especialy the robots(you can see an example for the detail of a cyberbrain on my side) are amazing and the character design is very good as well. In point of animation i would say that it sometimes lacks and sometimes its pretty nice. The talking sequences have their ordinary flap-mouths and they stand still pretty much while talking, but i would guess thats made so nothing distracts you while they talk, since the story is the main focus there. Moving animations are very solit and maybe even too good for their time made.\nCharacters 10/10: The characters in GitS are all very mature and some have a very logic thinking. You got some quite understandable charactermotivation for the main characters, and you see some dephts of some characters as well. The characterinteraction consists mostly out of police-talk or philosophical conversations.Since there are only mature characters, and characters are the personal connection to a story, you can see here that this anime is to appeal to mature audience. Overall the characters are pretty realistic (with their attitude and everything) and likeable.\n\nConclusion: \nI can only repeat myself: This anime is for mature audience. If your an ordinary animefan, then dont watch such a complex and deep shows like this, but over all:  GitS gives you a whole package of a very dark and mature futuristic world and its ideas.Its based on a combination of very deep and meaningful conversations, dark and very beatuiful artstyle and entertaining combat, doing a great job in all of these. This anime succeed in every aspect so perfectly. Maybe there have been made some similar futur storys jet, but clearly not in this kind of way, so the originality of this show is quite high. In my opinion this anime deserves to be called \"best anime ever made\".\n        "},

With the advent of the Internet and pocket-sized smartphones, it seems as if the gap between what is science-fiction and what is reality will eventually become nonexistent. One step along that path is the concept of cyborgs, or people who are half-man and half-machine. But what's most interesting isn't just the concept, but the questions it raises. For Ghost in the Shell, it brings about both action and answers.\nSTORY\nGhost in the Shell begins in\n          \n        stunning fashion. Major Motoko, presumably working for the government, assassinates a political diplomat, setting the stage for what the film has to offer.\nWith such an opening, Ghost in the Shell comes off as both mature and aimed at providing entertainment. This isn't a tale about a high school boy's harem or a campy slice-of-life; it's grisly, with espionage, violence, and killing. And it's something that the movie does quite well. Computer hacking, a one-on-one brawl taking place on an open pond, harrowing car chases, military tank battling, helicopter snipers; it's filled to the brim with sequences that are simultaneously action-packed and real. That last part is important, for two reasons. One, the show is fantastical, with its robots and invisibility cloaks. And two, the scenes progress \"normally.\" There are no over-expositions or lame outcomes; bullets pierce cars and people in an \"appropriate\" manner. In other words, the show maintains both realism and non-realism in just the right amount of doses.\nThis mix of two opposite sides isn't just found in the action. In fact, Ghost in the Shell actually goes philosophical. Here, in a world filled with computerized information and inhuman humans, a debate on man versus machine is had. Throughout the movie, Motoko questions her existence, as does the Puppet Master. And during the final scenario that takes place, a culmination of thought spills out. Humans themselves can be looked at as machines, containing rational thought, while harboring more animal bases. But there are still limitations in what is \"humanly possible.\" Machines are purely logical, making the choice that brings the most efficiency or the right answer. Being able to perform massive computations gives them the ability to understand the impossible. But their inability to incorporate emotions also limits their \"processing power.\"\nSo what does Ghost in the Shell make of these two opposing forces? Like my introduction discusses, that \"next step\" is taken. A merging of both people and ideals is had to attain a higher form of life, that next leap in technology. What the film conveys is that man and machine are definitely different but strangely similar. Questioning one's place and wanting to be \"something more\" is natural for any person, and, in this circumstance, cyborgs and robots, too. And by the end of the film, these thoughts of life and death that were presented continue on in the viewer, giving him or her newfound perspective.\nIntermittently throughout the movie, the show usually \"calms\" down so significantly, one wouldn't be remiss in thinking that it was switched out for another. This tactic is intelligent; not only does this give it the opportunity to showcase the world -- such as the creation of the \"Shells\" and the daily lives of the people -- but also it ties in with its established theme of dichotomy. By revving up the speed and then suddenly slowing everything down, it's as if the audience is taken on a roller coaster, experiencing the action-packed highs and the thought-provoking lows of the tone. Having one's adrenaline pumped up, losing it due to a moderate stretch of \"nothing,\" then immediately having it picked up again further adds to the uneasy sense that permeates the entire film.\nANIMATION\nThe art and animation for Ghost in the Shell are easily the highlight.\nThe art for the movie perfectly captures its own feelings. Many dull colors -- grays, browns, blacks, and purples -- are used for the backdrops and characters to give a heightened sense of ambiguity to match the mysterious nature of the ideas being presented. At the same time, everything feels dreary. The grainy filtering, the dilapidated buildings, and the constant overcast with rain create a mood that comes off as something being wrong. That despite the futuristic technology at everyone's disposal, not everything is right in this world.\nAt the same time, the camera direction gives various views of the cyberpunk environment. Wide shots of a darkened room with a lone window, scenic shots of the city from the rooftops, and seeing through another person's eyes gave unique takes on the world, adding further to the elements of action and vagueness.\nThe character designs are both appropriate and cool. Togusa and his mullet, Batou and his coined eyes, and Matoko and her stern face further cause the reiterated dissonance to be clearly evident.\nTo top it all off, the film's animation is superb. Bodies twist and turn during fights, with guns, bullets, and vehicles flowing seamlessly. Combined with smoke effects, subtle movements during conversations, and non-still backgrounds, it gives life to the setting where it is purposely designed to have none.\nCHARACTERS\nWhere Ghost in the Shell missteps ever so slightly is with the characters that populate it. Essentially, there are only two key players in the events that take place: Major Motoko and the Puppet Master.\nMajor Motoko takes center stage in this futuristic adventure. Stalwart in mind and strong of body, she is the epitome of soldiers designed for warfare. While her best friend is Batou and her police-partner is Togusa, she mostly keeps to herself, doing what she wants, if her propensities are powerful enough. Early on, we see Motoko contemplating the kind of life she leads, and a lot of her characterization is mired in the concept of \"birth.\" More specifically, \"rebirth\" or \"renewal.\" Having dreams of one's creation are not common; she frequently finds herself literally floating upwards in the sea to recreate that sensation and event. At the same time, we find her discussing the concept of \"becoming someone else\" with Batou and later on seeing her head on that of a child's body: not a regression, but a restart of her entire person.\nAnd what's interesting is where her mind focuses. Motoko places heavy emphasis on the beginning of life, but almost completely ignores its end. For her, death means nothing; she doesn't care if she drowns while enjoying her hobby or having her head crushed by immense pressure. What she values is not just where she came from but who she is now. On a daily basis, she sees how easy a soul can be snuffed out by her or anyone. The film extends this thinking further by investigating the psyche. She witnesses a man whose very memories are altered, and even \"finds herself\" on a self-reflective walk through the city. In short, she is constantly worrying about her existence.\nTransitioning briefly to the last important character, the Puppet Master is another person -- or rather a program -- who holds similar trains of thought. Without a true Shell of his own, \"he\" was created as a tool to be used at will by those of Section 6 for their personal gain. His name holds symbolic meaning on many fronts; he is master of the system to which he is a part of yet a slave to the rules and regulations that govern it; and while he may be able to take over lifeless \"Shells\" at a whim, he himself is just as much a doll as the one's he controls (as is said by the head of Section 9, Daisuke).\nSadly, not much is known about his character; in essence, he is barely shown at all. There is one exception: his obsession with life and death. He sees himself as a sentient being, as someone who is defined as existing in this world. However, he feels \"incomplete\" due to a lack of death. For him, his start holds no meaning, for it revolves around malice, anger, and evil. Instead, his interest in death is logical in that it makes the most sense for his \"well-being\" and rational in that it provides him with the \"closure\" he dreams of having.\nAnd thus it becomes clear once more. As the Puppet Master aptly describes it, he and Motoko are \"mirror images.\" They're similar but separate; one thinks of birth and life whereas the other thinks of life and dying. The recurring theme of opposites and the unknown that divides them shines here quite brightly. And in a poignant conclusion, the two become one, signifying a departure from what is seemingly \"broken\" to unbelievably \"whole.\" Unfortunately, this development in their characters is not looked at in length. Despite having built up to a crescendo, the film falls silent; perhaps this is just one more demonstration of the theme at play. Regardless, the audience is left to ponder what exactly such an outcome means, both in context of that universe and our own.\nSOUND\nWhat's fascinating is how little music actually goes into Ghost in the Shell, while still remaining atmospherically relevant. The one track that gets used the most, with its lone drum and creepy singing, further generates the unsettling sense that takes over much of the movie. At certain moments, it even opts to use more ambient sounds, where one can barely hear the faint tones of the wind-like music. The film can get more \"spiritual\" when it wants to, too: the slow violin and erratic guitar piece feels mysterious and the violin, chimes, and eventual choir-singing track that backs up the final fight has a distant but hopeful aura about it.\nBeyond the soundtrack, the sound effects that comprise everything involved are also well-done. Bullets flying, guns clicking, water splashing, camouflage activating; a flurry of sounds barrage the audience that replace the modern use of music, making the film that much more unique.\nOverall, the voice-acting involved is about average. Atsuko Tanaka as Motoko is soft-spoken and serious, Akio Atsuka as Batou is rough yet kind as the situation needs it, and Iemasa Kayumi as the Puppet Master maintains a monotone form of talking that matches his machine-like manifestation.\nAs a final note, the film is markedly quiet. Certain lines are hardly audible when spoken, and many segments are inhibited from being even marginally loud.\nENJOYMENT\nThis movie sounds awesome when described: cybernetic hacking, slick action sequences, and various weapons utilized for combat are just a slathering of what the movie has to offer. Yet I never found myself truly enticed by the film. Certain parts are exciting, but it never felt as if I had to see what was going to be happening next.\nPart of this issue is the characters. Honestly speaking, they're intriguing, but incredibly boring to watch. Relating to them is extremely difficult, not just because they're mostly made up of computer parts but also because they have this air about them. An air of \"in-control,\" where the entire circumstance never feels as if it will not go their way. It's not that \"realism\" is destroyed; it's more that the experience isn't gripping, all of the \"Hollywood\" moments notwithstanding.\nFinally, it felt as if the film was a half-hour or so too short. With a bit more time, more fighting sequences, more characterization of the Puppet Master, and more meaningful development of the hybrid of technology that was instantiated could have been had, making it an even more well-rounded package.\nGhost in the Shell is a movie that introduces two concepts: a futuristic, computer-dominated world and philosophical questioning on what it means to be. With its well-crafted story, interesting characters, and stellar art and animation, it's a movie that still stands the test of time.\nSUMMARY\nStory: Great, nice action sequences, moral questioning on man versus machine, thematic balance\nAnimation: Great, dreary art to create ambiguity, nice camera direction, cool character designs, great actual animation\nCharacters: Good, Motoko and the Puppet Master are \"mirror images,\" but lack consequential development\nSound: Good, atmospheric soundtrack, nice sound effects, okay VA work, weirdly quiet\nEnjoyment: Fine, entertaining at times, lacking relatability, a bit too short in length\nFinal Score: 8/10\n        "},

I can understand what is it trying to do, and i appreaciate it but honestly it's way too direct. Shows that try to follow this whole \"Show, don't tell\" concept, which essentially means passing thought without saying it using visual means only and asking the audience questions are cool i know, i love them, but GiTS kinda just failed it overall, probably due to just being short with no bulid-up and the way it did the things it did, ugh it just didn't feel right.\nOk i agree it explored enough through the issues of a cyberpunk\n          \n        society like \"if anybody can get the body they want, what is the point of gender?\" \"if nothing other than a little piece of your brain is there, what really makes you human?\" \" You haven't seen inside your head, how can you prove you exist?\" all those are the questions it asks, but it does that too direct, instead of giving a case study of a character, like Evangelion, or maybe giving a case study of any human, or just humanity in general like Serial Experiments Lain, or at least giving in some context like Ergo Proxy did, then yeah those would make the show a 10/10 because having all this exestintalism really is the tip of the iceberg, to finish off a good enough show and make it perfect and memorable, but GiTS does that and nothing else really.\nI'm going to watch the sequel to see if it gets better. \nIf you really want to make the viewer think about what's happening on screen, you should really show him, instead of just asking almost comical pseudo-existential questions.\nThe art is the best side of this though, very cool and smooth high-budget art of the 90s really looks fine, reminds me of End of Evangelion\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"Any simulated experiences or dreams, exist as information, and are simulaneously reality and fantasy\"\n        "},

I kept thinking, \"when does the action start?\", but it never did. The plot is a trainwreck; trying to connect a series of non sequiturs does not make for something interesting. The art was -OK- for a film from the 90s but I personally did not like the style. Music plays an important role in setting the mood for any presentation but you do not get that with this movie. Instead, you get a bunch of wailing that you're expected to enjoy. Other than that, sound effects were nothing\n          \n        to complain about. Moving on, there was good characterization, everyone feeling like a corrupt future politician or cyborg or some shit, even though the main character was very boring (was it only because she was a machine? I can't think of another reason for having such a lifeless and impressionable protagonist. If so, they captured that well.) The main villain was a joke, doing nothing the entire length of the movie and yet somehow being a most wanted world class criminal, then talking the protagonist into joining his(?) side, then immediately dying. So, in case you're wondering, I did not enjoy this movie at all and do not recommend it to anyone.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="                          \n    Ghost in the Shell is a franchise that needs no introduction. Shirow Masamune's work has been adapted into several movies, video games, anime and even a line of toys. It's been one of the most influential cyberpunk franchises out there. Whether you like or dislike it, you have to respect how much it's influenced the genre. I remember liking this film okay when I first saw it. However, it has been quite a while since then. So it's time to re-watch the movie and see how it holds up. \nThe story opens in a futuristic city with an attempted defection being thwarted by a group\n          \n        of largely cybernetic federal agents known as section 9. Section 9 is quickly charged with bringing in a hacker known as the puppet master who's trying to hack the brain of a secretary who works for an important official. Now, these events are related, but I won't spoil how they're linked on the off chance that someone reading this hasn't seen the film yet. The story here is really well constructed. Virtually every scene proves to be important. All the major plot points are introduced before they become important. Which isn't easy given how much hinges on futuristic technology. The plot initially seems rather disparate, but as it advances you realise that it's all very intricately put together with all of the events coming together to make the story whole. It does raise some interesting questions about the future and the implications of technology, but I can't give it too much credit there since the implications it deals with are nothing new to sci-fi. Still, the world is very creative and the questions aren't handled badly by any means. The only real issue with the story is that there are some substantial stretches where nothing happens. Although, to be fair, these scenes do serve to immerse you in the world which does lead to a really strong atmosphere. That being said, some of them do go on too long. \nThe characters aren't as strong as the story. That isn't to say they're badly done, though. They all feel fairly well fleshed out and three dimensional. That being said, there's a lot about them that isn't explained very well. For instance, Mokoto becomes obsessive about the case for no adequately explained reason. We might be able to say it's just who she is, but several other characters comment on how strangely she's been acting. Which the audience can't really recognise well since we haven't seen her outside of this case. In all fairness, there's enough information provided at the end that you can make a decent guess, but there's no way to verify it meaning it's just going to be speculation. \nThe art in this is amazing. The environments are rich with good texture. The technology is really impressive. The climactic fight scene is spectacular. My only issue with the art is that Mokoto randomly takes off her clothes in order to use the camouflage technology they have. Now, before anyone tries to say \"that's just how the tech works\" allow me to point out that another character is shown using the same technology and he does it with a fully covering suit. Mokoto's only works differently because someone wanted to draw boobs. Which would also explain the opening credit sequence. It's just ruddy fan-service. Which does detract from the film a little bit, albeit not much. \nThe voice acting is well done. Sakamoto Maaya, Kayumi Iemasa, Yamadera Kouichi, and Ootsuka Akio all do well in their roles. Really, there aren't any weak performances in this. The music is really well used. The only real issue with it is that it plays the same song during every atmospheric scene and the song ends up kind of over-played. \nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. There's really only one female character in this and she can't exactly be homo-erotic towards herself. And no, the Puppet master doesn't count. \nGhost in the Shell holds up surprisingly well. The world is immersive with a great sense of atmosphere. The story is excellent and the art and voice acting both hold up really well, even after nearly two decades. Sure, it has some issues, but there's nothing that should detract from the experience too much. Unless you just hate cyberpunk you'll probably find it an enjoyable experience. I give it a 9/10. I initially ended up giving it a 6 when I was scoring it from memory, but it's actually quite a bit better than I remembered. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    After watching Ghost in the Shell I felt compelled to write my first review. I haven’t delved much into the anime world, only here recently. This being my first review bare with me, they are sure to get better in time.\nPlot - The central plot and concept of the story is based on a cyberpunk/military/police theme. Not being a huge cyberpunk fan, but the human/machine divide is a fascinating topic, one that I truly believe could be touched on more often. The storytelling in the movie came off a bit horrible. The movie is more than a decade old by now; thus, possibly showing its\n          \n        age in the lack thereof a thick storyline. The main things I fell in love with would be the slow, brief moments in the movie. The points depicting scenes that allow you to sit back and try to understand everything as a whole. Although some scene transitions didn't make much sense at times. The important part, in my opinion, was Motoko Kusanagi's story and inner conflict. I loved that she left us asking questions within our self. Do we really exist or are we replicas of a previous life? If we lost all our memories, would we still be the same self that we believe to be? What would happen if you combined different souls? \nCharacters - Motoko Kusanagi came off as a strong yet very conflicted character. I felt she could be a capable leader with strong relationships with her team members even having a seemingly independent and harsh exterior. If given more time or maybe better budget with the movie maybe we could have seen a better unfolding of not only her character but the entirety of the cyborgs and possibly the section. I often found myself wondering why Batou cared so much for Motoko. Aramaki and Togusa are even more of a mystery with little to no elaboration into their positions in Section 9. Another character; although bad, I found myself wondering about would be “The Puppet Master” aka Project 2501. The Puppet master's dialogue did clearly present the topic of a human mind with mechanical origins, but I still found myself yearning to learn more. What disturbed this individual? Why did they want to infect the web with their children? \nVideo/Animation – For the most part given this is an older movie the cityscapes and water scene were utterly breath taking. Interiors and laboratories were designed great for the most part. Weapon and vehicle designs came off great. \nOverall Analysis – Having watched this and not having any knowledge of Ghost in the Shell I would still suggest it to anyone who should ask me. Ghost in the Shell has merit as a classic. The storytelling was poor and some characters were underdeveloped. The idea if we lost it all and how would our lives be losing our memories is probably one of the main things I will take away from this movie.\n"},

It's a philosophical piece, told through psychological means, in a cyberpunk setting. \nThis movie condenses an immense amount of content into one hour and twenty-two minutes. So much so that it causes a multitude of flaws and hiccups. The story feels rushed, completely messing up the pacing. The execution is nowhere near perfect, but the content is. To be clear though, for a short movie like this, the execution is well above expected. \nThis series deals with many complex philosophical arguments, on the side of Major Kusanagi, and\n          \n        the Puppet Master himself. What is the self? What is life? What is consciousness? What is the soul? What would happen if you combined different souls? What's human (?) versus what's Artificial Intelligence? What are memories and how do they affect the self? Is the self a consequence of memories, or are memories a consequence of the self? Would you still be yourself if you had completely different memories? etc... There's so much philosophy in this short movie, that it amazes me they managed to fit all of it in and still managed to find time to waste. \nThis movie is gorgeous, deep, and though provoking. It's simply an amazing story, told beautifully. I recommend it to everyone. Even if you've already encountered these philosophical arguments elsewhere, like The Matrix and Serial Experiments Lain, it's still a really good take on them. If you haven't, let's get you thinking existentially. You'll have a different outlook on reality and consciousness. \n        "},

After hearing some things about Ghost in the shell, I thought it sounded interesting (by name anyway), but I was kind of disappointed.  It's good how the movie shows that people may actually just be cyborgs being controlled by someone else; that even though someone's mind can be potentially be uploaded to the web, but it'll only be a copy of the original; and a few other themes that I just don't feel the need to list.\nAs you can see, I gave it a 6/10.  I\n          \n        didn't hate this, but it could've been better. SPOILER: I would've liked to see more on the guy who had his memories altered and also so more information on the main character.   The animation is good though, considering the year it was made and the sound is decent.  It's hard to care much about characters when there is not much to them. In the end, I just don't think it draws the viewer into the story enough since so much information seems to be thrown at you without enough explanation.  Maybe give it a shot, but I think Ghost in the Shell is just another anime that's thought of as one of the best because it's considered a classic.  Maybe I'd be drawn in more if I watch the stuff that came after this, but I didn't enjoy this one too much, and don't plan to continue.\n        "},

As Motoko and her teammates go through multiple battles with other criminals linked to this, there are\n          \n        many moments where Motoko gets really philosophical about whether her body and identity are truly hers.\nThis is what makes the film incredibly interesting, because it makes you think if Motoko or anyone who has a ghost is actually in control and are still themselves and not someone else.\nThe plot of the story can really confuse people, especially when you get into the second half, when Motoko starts talking about this more and more until the Puppet Master fully appears and tries to merge his and Motoko's minds together to create a new being, which went over my head completely the first time. However during my second watch I understood it much better and makes the story feel like utter genius when you actually understand what is going on.\nCharacters (9/10)\nNow there isn't that much to focus on when it comes to the character that aren't Motoko, but it sets up the personalities of the characters we come to love in the later TV series.\nMotoko Kusanagi is the most interesting character of the whole show, well mostly. Apart from her brain, her whole body is cybernetic and the way this reflects her character and personality really shows, she's strong and has great leadership skills yet she always questions whether she is fully in control of her body and if it really is her own. This makes her a very complex character and is only the beginning of the mysterious nature she'll bring in the later TV series, which hugely build upon her character.\nBatou and Togusa are Motoko's trusty teammates in Section 9, Batou is only partially augmented, while Togusa doesn't have any implants at all.\nThey both like to make jokes, especially at each other and this provides a more human side to the list of characters in the franchise since they are still mostly flesh and blood making them much more relatable.\nAramaki is the leader of Section 9, like Togusa, he is also doesn't have any implants and his age makes him a wise person hence why he feels like a proper leader of a secret military police force.\nArt (10/10)\nFor something that is now more than 20 years old, Ghost in the Shell looks absolutely amazing. It has created one of the most interesting and diversive sci-fi worlds being up there with Star Wars, Doctor Who and Blade Runner, from the way the Dystopian setting looks and feel  makes it very closely connected to the Blade Runner franchise, but it really works well here.\nI like how there was also just an entire segment dedicated to showing off how detailed and jaw dropping the scenery looked. It does make me sad that a lot of anime's which come out these days seem to have lost this magic although anime wasn't as mainstream back then.\nSound (10/10)\nThe soundtrack is also something truly spectacular, it's musical beats gave it the true sci-fi feel, while also adding in a loud choir that really amplifies the mystery and tone of the film, especially when it was being used in the long segment showing Motoko travelling through the city.\nExtras:\nIt is definitely a huge thought inducing psychological film and it does this incredibly well, considering I had to watch the film multiple times just to understand it and the idea behind it is also really interesting. It really makes you think about what's real and what isn't, whether your identity is actually you're own just makes the brain work overtime and brings out a really special experience.\nThe action was pretty damn good too, true there was only a few fights, but they were still cinematically brilliant to see, especially the garbage truck chase scene and Motoko's standoff with a bipedal tank were really memorable moments.\nEnjoyment (10/10)\nOverall (10/10)\nOverall this film is a masterpiece and after all these years is still an incredibly awesome film to watch, however the sequel to this film, Innocence wasn't exactly the best at trying to repeat the success of this.\n        "},

It is also the anime that inspired the Matrix,  one of the most influential movies of the West as well Ghost in the Shell. \nOh Ghost in the Shell,  there's\n          \n        an undying loving bond that immediately draws my attention to you and that is the presentation. Ghost in the Shell takes place in Newport City of 2029, after a world war,  cybernetics are common and can be replaced with prosthetics in any humans. One particular cyborg,  Major Motoko Kusanagi,  was created and thus joins a task enforcement unit called Public Security Section 9, where' she and her team,  Batou, Togusa, and Chief Aramaki, tasked to hunt down a notorious hacker known as the Puppet Master. \nThe plot seem very simplistic maybe even shallow. However, that's not the main strong point what makes Ghost in the Shell a wondrous masterpiece. You see,  there's a simple question some of us may ask, \"what makes us human? \" a simple question yes, but Kusanagi herself goes through a dilemma where she questions the existence of her \"humanity\" whether she has a \"ghost\" inside of her. Of course,  the metaphor for Ghost in the Shell is a representation of a speculation of a soul that is inside of a machine \nGhost in the Shell was famous for its brilliant writing when conveying philosophical questions and symbolism. It is also known for the heavy dialogue which some viewers may find boring but the strongest point comes from the dialogue. As for symbolism, the artstyle is definitely the most impressive with scenery and background,  reminiscent to the actual city of Hong Kong,  which Newport City inspires by. The atmosphere in Ghost in the Shell gives a mysterious vibe and sometimes a sense of danger in the city Motoko was part of. Many of the scenery goes along with the symbolism helps develops more metaphors that shapes Motoko's dilemma. \nMotoko herself portrays herself as if she is human but not entirely. Most of her dialogue hints the emotions she points out when being curious of her humanity. Motoko's character is a cyborg, she can be a female but also a male since she has no specific gender despite the fact she obviously looks female but acts bulky,  tough, strong-willed and independent cyborg while keeping the feminine appearance.  She's recognized as \"human\" by her colleagues. \nThe action in the movie are beautifully choreographed,  mostly taken in motion captured like aesthetics. Very very impressive which greatly surpasses the classic 1988 Akira which factually has much of an expensive budget value than other anime. Great impact of the guns and bullets ricochet and the amazing future tech that is visually stunning to see. \nOh the sountrack,  the most iconic soundtrack made by the legend Kenji Kawai who's musical score consist of choirs and traditional music similarly to Akira but the soundtrack are viseral,  god-like and fits the theme that convey the uncertainty of comparison between cyborg and human especially Making of Cyborg. Mystical and majestic, the music are like sex to the ears. \nGhost in the Shell was not only influential but also landmark anime film that trancended the standards of an average anime. A mainstream masterpiece most adults adore despite the shallow story but the jaw-dropping stunning visuals, very complex philosophical ideas,  and dialogue cleverly written and used metaphors to display Motoko's dilemma. A must-watch anime film if you're a self-proclaimed hardcore anime fan. \n        "},

I'm 26 now. I still fall asleep every time. With the exception of the action scenes and opening credits, I can't say that this film is worth watching. \nThe delivery of the story leaves a lot to be desired. The scene structure is, essentially:\n-> Gorgeous animated sequence that ends too quickly\n-> Characters giving long, monotonous explanations of things that would have been better represented through gorgeous animation sequences, or at least not through what is essentially \"radio\"\n-> Rinse, repeat\nI know anime\n          \n        doesn't grow on trees and there are budgets, but it takes a lot away from the experience of the film when so much of it consists of talking heads. There's almost no characterization to speak of, and those sequences are all the more excruciating because of it. \nI get that strong characterization is not the point, but the concepts that form the foundation of the film are kind of trite and not interesting enough to carry a story on their own. \nI understand and appreciate the historical significance of this film, but I'd say save yourself some trouble and just watch clips on youtube and read the synopsis. \n        "},

The Japanese government creates a security section to deal with such matters. This section is known as public security section nine, a group of counter cyber-terrorists who deal with various issues from artificial body theft to ghost hacking. (A term when someone hacks into someone's ghost. Easiest way to describe it is it's kinda like possession and the\n          \n        hacker can also rearrange people's memories.

Motoko Kusunagi and her fellow section nine agents are assigned onto the investigation after a diplomats interpreter is ghost hacked and the word is 'The Puppetmaster' is involved.\nGITS is a wonderfully made movie. The action scenes are awesome, the storyline is full of plot twists and is quite compelling. The artwork is incredible, and the performances of the vocal actors are to be commended. Some may find the music annoying but I loved it. In retrospect it's a great anime. One definitely worth a look and a must for anime collectors and otakus alike. I give it 10/10.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    There is a lot of philosophy in the world, ranging from theories about the future, the past, and all the little lessons in between. Out of all of them, the one I ponder about the most is the definition of life.\nNow, I don't mean that scientific definition. According to science, it is a condition that separates organisms from inorganic, such as the need for food, sleep, growth, reproduction, and death.\nI mean life as in your very own existence. Your consciousness. I've always wondered what a consciousness was. Is it something that can be transported from body to body? What are the things that make up\n          \n        a consciousness? Is your consciousness all you need to make up your identity? Even if your memories are gone, if you maintain the same consciousness, can you be safely assumed to be the same person?\nGhost in the Shell tries to tackle this philosophical question through the use of Sci-Fi, and it did so in amazing and thought provoking ways. It goes beyond the boundary of what can be considered as a human, or what can be considered as a life. It does so by asking \"What if consciousness can be downloaded into a machine? Would that machine still be considered human? Can a consciousness be born from data? If so, can it still be considered life?\" \nGhost in the Shell really makes you probe your brain about the definition of a soul, as well as how machine a human can be before no longer being considered a human.\nPros:\n- Great execution on a very thought provoking theme.\n- Art and animation is way ahead of its time.\n- Very atmospheric and well fitting OST.\n- Well executed, unique, and engaging story that will eventually inspire movies like the Matrix.\nCons:\n- The movie almost only touches on existential questioning.\n- Not much explanation of the world, thus it can get confusing.\n- Characters aren't really dived into that much either.\nStory: 9\nGhost in the Shell takes place in a world where the Sci-Fi is both incredibly fresh and advanced, yet still holds an air of realism. The world isn't too scientifically advanced to the point where it loses all relatability, and it has some scientific upgrades like the massive use of AI and high tech tracking devices, yet it still holds a lot of old school technology like old styled phones. However, the world of Ghost in the Shell also has a lot of incredibly advanced and refreshing technologies, such as camouflage cloaks and information that can be directly downloaded into one's brain. \nDespite the highly detailed sci-fi world, that really isn't what the story is about. Ghost in the Shell questions the existence of one's soul, and uses Sci-Fi to express possible answers to this question. The way it asks these philosophical questions is really deep, and it will start nagging away at your brain. These aren't questions that are just randomly thrown out there for the sake of asking them, these questions are asked in an extremely serious and mature manner and will demand the audience to think about an answer in an equally serious and mature way.\nArt: 10\nYou know a show is ahead of its times when its action scenes are better animated than shows 14 years later. Ghost in the Shell not only has incredibly dynamic animation in both shootout and close combat scenes, but it also has a very detailed and beautifully drawn world. From extremely detailed backgrounds, to vibrant and impactful fight scenes, to brilliant use of computer code, Ghost in the Shell is incredible art wise.\nSound: 9\nSporting an incredibly spooky OST, Ghost in the Shell really sets up the atmospheric and philosophical mood well through its sound. Not only is the OST extremely good, but the sound effects are really good as well, although a bit overdone at times. The sound and art of Ghost in the Shell were made for each other, and they support each other flawlessly. There were many scenes were it was just a background visual with the soundtrack playing in the background. These scenes were just breathtaking.\nCharacter: 8\nGhost in the Shell introduced us to some incredibly mature and respectable characters. While the movie didn't really dive deeply into the characteristics of each character, you could tell from their interactions and actions that they were strong characters.\nEnjoyment: 10\nA perfect combination of thrilling action with deep philosophy, Ghost in the Shell had its moments of brainless fun as well as its moments of intellectual thought. As a fan of both spectrums, Ghost in the Shell was just a pure blast to watch.\nOverall: 9\nGhost in the Shell is basically a timeless classic in the anime world nowadays, and I can see why. It was a deep and thought provoking show that was also drawn and animated beautifully.\nTL;DR: Do you know what else doesn't have a soul?\n        "},

The runtime of little over an hour goes fast as you watch this gazing movie unfold.\nThe movie is not perfect tough. Characters and the story of the movie are interesting for sure, but the movie lefts you wanting more. It ends rather quickly and the ideas that the movies try to touch on don't feel really fleshed out.\nGhost in the shell is, in my opinion, a very good movie. It's a cagey, brain racing experience. Minds who are thinkers and into sci-fi stuff will\n          \n        love it.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    For a film that had such a groundbreaking impact and huge influence not only on Japanese animation but also on Western cinematography, you'd think that there would be much more reviews on this site, but there's only 15 or so in total, and only a handful of them are of significant length. So I'll try to do the movie justice and file my own review, and I have to warn you, it will be very, very long.\nP.S. I should also warn you that there will be spoilers, as this review is mostly aimed at those who have already seen this film and are looking for\n          \n        somebody else's opinion on it. If you didn't see the film, I'd recommend you to watch the movie anyway, even after I spoil it for you.\nFirst thing that should be said about GITS, no matter how cliched it might be, is that it is a classic. It's a work of art. And being a work of art doesn't mean that it is absolutely perfect in every aspect. No, GITS does have its shortcomings, but after you properly think about the film, none of these shortcomings are crucial to the film's message and aims. Being a work of art means that the movie is perfect in the way that matters, and that it achieves its set goals and purposes. You won't hear anyone talking bad about, say, Crime and Punishment just because there isn't a thrilling plot or some great mysteries, because the book isn't about that. And even though it does have an interesting and suspenseful plot, in the end Ghost in the Shell isn't about crime fighting or counter-cyberterrorism.\nNo, Ghost in the Shell is, first and foremost, an ode to transhumanism and a philosophical work that centres on issues of identity and finding an answer to one's existential questions in a world where you can't be sure that your identity is even \"yours\". But before I dive into the real substance of the movie, I'd rather take care of the technical side of things.\nOne of the more important things that should be stressed when reviewing GITS, is that it's largely a visual experience. Indeed, this is one of the most atmospheric, most visually stunning movies EVER, including all Western animated movies. What's so special about GITS's visuals? Well, for starters, every single shot in the movie was made with great care and effort. The amount of detail on most frames is amazing - even when we're in the middle of an intense action scene ( where most other animated movies tend to cut corners on backgrounds, features etc. ), the movie keeps the same level of detail and clarity that's present in the more artsy and slow paced scenes. Newport City, where the story takes place, was modeled after Hong Kong, and the production crew made a trip to Hong Kong and shot a bunch of photos which they later used to create a setting that is not only extremely cyberpunkish in appearance and style, but also quite realistic, making the whole future setting of Ghost in the Shell much more believable and \"real\" than the setting of such movies as Akira or Blade Runner ( which was a clear inspiration not only for the visual style of GITS, but the cyberpunk genre in general ). In the middle of the movie there is a whole scene, several minutes long, with no dialogue or plot whatsoever, just a number of sequences and shots depicting a depressing, somewhat run-down, claustrophobic and oppressive place in which the story takes place. The scenes immerse you in the futuristic world where extreme poverty and depravity are juxtaposed to the shiny, glass-covered and a bit surreal corporate world of office towers, neon signs and luxurious shops. \nJust like the style, the animation and graphics of GITS are top-notch. Keeping the sense of realism established by the style and graphics, the animation team has put a lot of effort into making the motions and effects as realistic as possible - objects fall or fly so naturally, you can almost \"feel\" their mass, human motion is fluid and natural... I'll give you an example of how much thought and effort was put in this movie - there's a scene in which Motoko confronts a criminal while wearing her termo-optic camouflage ( invisibility cloak ). The scene takes place in shallow water, and while she is invisible, her shadow can be seen on the bottom; her camouflage only deflects the light, giving an illusion of invisibility, but there's still a physical object blocking the sunlight.\nCharacter designs are great, fitting the personalities of each of them; Motoko and Batou, who are both cyborgs, mostly have an expressionless, robotic appearance. \nThis is especially true for Motoko, who has a fully cybernetic body, with only her brain remaining biological. It is important to note that there's a large difference in Motoko's movie incarnation and her appearance in the manga and Stand Alone Complex series. Here she has lifeless, pale green eyes as opposed to red in the manga. Also, she has a somewhat androgynous face and a masculine body, and both these characteristics are essential not only to her personality and character development, but also to one of the underlying themes of the film, which I will discuss later.\nBatou, while mostly a cyborg, still retains much more of his biological body and thus more humanity than Motoko, which is reflected in him showing much more emotion than the Major, and having more facial expressions. All the other characters also have detailed, interesting and memorable designs.\nOverall the visual aspects of Ghost in the Shell deserve a perfect score, and it would be worth seeing this film for the visuals alone.\nBut the superb visuals alone are not enough to create a truly mesmerizing experience that completely immerses the viewer into the world that you have created. In order to make the viewing experience complete, you also need a well-made and a well-timed soundtrack, and Ghost in the Shell is just as brilliant in the audio department as it is in visuals. While all the little things like gunfire, random chattering of people in the market or splashes of water are very important in creating a realistic and vibrant setting, it is Kenji Kawai’s brilliant soundtrack that gives the movie its second layer, that of a gloomy and eery future where technology warps and changes the very essence of our society and our identity. The real jewel in the sountrack’s crown is the song “Making of a Cyborg”, a haunting choral piece played during the opening credits, where we can see Motoko’s body being built and her brain placed inside of it. But this song is a lot more than just a nice-sounding piece of music; like many other things in this movie, there’s a deeper meaning and symbolism in it.\nAs the opening credits roll ( in form of a “rain” of green letters and numbers that was copied by the Wachowski brothers in the Matrix movies ), we see Motoko’s brain, her ghost, being lowered into the skull of her cybernetic body, her shell. After that, skin, hair and fat tissue are added to the body, and by the end of the credits, her body is fully complete. During the procedure, there are several shots of her in a fetal position, and the whole process is carried out in a way that very much resembles a birth of a human. The entire scene is meant to represent a symbolic birth, but also a kind of marriage. \nThe song I previously mentioned, “Making of a Cyborg”, is in fact a marital chant that is supposed to protect the newlyweds from all the evil influences and temptations. Thus, by considering both the visual and auditive aspects of the scene, we can see that it is meant to represent the “marriage” between Motoko’s mind/ghost and her body/shell. With hindsight, it can also be interpreted as foreshadowing of the union between herself and the Puppet Master. \nThe idea of rebirth is one of the main underlying concepts during the film, and is most obviously represented through the merger of Motoko’s mind with the Puppet Master, which results in a creation of a new, higher entity, that is at the same time both Motoko and the Puppet Master – their union changes them, but also allows them to retain all of the characteristics and traits that make them who they are ( “We will both undergo change, but there is nothing for either of us to lose” ). Being “reborn” should not be taken literally, as neither of them physically dies and is reborn, but should be interpreted more as a change. Motoko is “reborn” in a sense that she becomes a new person ( her mind/ghost changes ), just like her “first rebirth”, in which she was given a new body, changes her physically, from a biological human to a complete cyborg. The need for change is stressed on several occasions, and it is pointed out by the Puppet Master that it is in the essence of human nature to constantly change and adapt ( Motoko: “Can you guarantee that I will still be my old self?” Puppet Master: “I cannot. People change, and your longing to remain “yourself” is what ultimately limits you.” ). \nThe idea of change is expanded upon by both Motoko and the Puppet Master asserting that the strength lies in diversity. Early in the film, Motoko explains to one of her co-workers, Togusa, who is the most biologically human member of Section 9, that she brought him to Section 9 from the local police force because they need diversity; no matter how technologically advanced and capable the cyborg members of the unit are, a skilled hacker could theoretically incapacitate them all with a single virus, seeing as their cyberbrains all function on the same operative system. Thus, by having Togusa among them, they can retain operational capacity even during such emergencies. \nThe Puppet Master’s motives for wanting to merge with Motoko and create a new entity, rather than simply copying himself, are quite similar. He ( or she ) fears that a single virus could destroy all of his copies, since copying gives no originality and diversity, and opts for a union with a human instead. \nSearch for answers is the second main theme present in the film, and is interwoven with the ideas of rebirth and change. The pursuit of the Puppet Master changes Motoko’s psyche further, and she starts to question her own identity as a human after seeing to what extent can the person’s memories and feelings be manipulated and fabricated. While the idea of tampering with memories and the existential questions that arise from that were directly inspired by/taken from the 1982 movie “Blade Runner”, and as such aren’t as original, Ghost in the Shell provides a completely different answers and resolutions to them. While the replicants from Blade Runner yearn to become human and live longer as ordinary people, Motoko’s quest to find the answers to her own existential and metaphysical questions results in her embracing the change and pursuing the alternative means to define her own identity. During the opening credits Motoko unites with her cybernetic body, and we see her body in all its detail and complexity. During the film we can also witness all the stunning abilities of a cybernatically enhanced body – improved reflexes and perception, superhuman strength and agility... But during the climactic fight scene, Motoko is unable to defeat the armoured tank. In an attempt to open the hatch and disable the tank, she overloads her body and it gets torn apart. She falls down from the tank, broken and helpless. Her body is completely destroyed and her invisibility suit is split apart – in the beginning we saw her being built, and now we’ve made a full circle to see her broken and vulnerable. Fortunately, Batou saves her from being killed by the tank, and even though her body has been severely damaged, she remains alive. From this we can extrapolate that it isn’t her body that defines Motoko, it’s her mind, her determination to pursue her own goals and answers. She then boldly steps into the future, becoming what can be described as the next step in human evolution; she no longer needs any physical means to identify herself. This concept of humans transcending their fragile physical bodies and becoming something “more” is the essence of philosophical thought called “transhumanism” ( look it up ), and while some people might be alienated by this, it should be pointed out that the movie doesn’t shove this message down the viewer’s throat. The whole idea of the film is a quest for answers and questioning your core beliefs about what makes us human; is the essence of being human being completely biological? Maybe it’s only the brain that matters because it holds our mind, our thoughts and memories? Or maybe we should go a step further, maybe it’s only our mind, our ghost, regardless whether it resides in neurons or in the vastness of the Net? The movie merely presents its own answers to these questions, and leaves it up to the viewer to agree or disagree with them. The answer that Motoko finds does not necessarily have to answer our own questions, especially since we are not ( yet ) cyborgs and therefore cannot fully empathise with her. \nI’ve already mentioned several times that the movie deals with the issues of identity, but it goes a step further than that, and also focuses more specifically on the issues of female identity. Yes, this movie has a subtle feminist message, and before you roll your eyes thinking “how can a movie with so many scenes of female nudity have any kind of feminist message?”, please allow me to elaborate.\nYes, there is a number of scenes where Motoko is nude, but if you take a closer look, you’ll see that none of them are meant to be erotic. Let us return to the opening credits; the scene opens with images of Motoko’s body still being merely muscles and bones. We can see all the complex machinery that powers the body and keeps her alive. After the body is complete, Motoko is standing nude and bare-breasted and the wind is sweeping her hair. But how can you look at her as an erotic figure when you know that under her soft skin lies the cold reality of a machine built of metal and wires, and when just a moment ago she had no eyes, skin or hair? The same goes for the final fight scene when her body breaks down – as she’s desperately trying to open the hatch, her body goes from its normal slender figure to an overly muscular one. After that her body is broken and parts of her are literally flying through the air. Coupled with the fact that she has an androgynous face and a muscular, manly figure ( thus taking away from the notion that she’s supposed to have the appearance of a playboy model to entertain the male audience ) , but also a deep and complex personality ( evident in her thoughtfulness and emotional strength ), as well as there being a few scenes like the one in the boat where Batou averts his eyes when Motoko undresses, the movie forces us to think: “Should I really be seeing her merely as a lustful figure? Isn’t it a bit misogynistic to reduce her to a mere object of sexual fantasies”. I was already asking myself these questions when I first watched this film, and after I read/heard several opinions of other people on this film, I became confident that I wasn’t reading too much into this.\nYou are free to disagree, but for me, the movie sends a subtle message that we should see women for who they are as persons, rather than judging them merely by their appearance. \nThere are several other metaphors and symbols in the film, expressed solely through visuals. Probably the most apparent of these is the wall relief from the tank-battle scene. During the scene Motoko manages to dodge the tank’s fire, but the tank continues to shoot and destroys the relief on the wall behind Motoko. The relief is in form of a tree depicting the evolution of fish ( I think ), and the tank destroys almost all of it, but the bullets run out just before it blows off the word “hominis”. The word is a genitive singular form of the latin word “homo”, which means “man”, or “human”. The metaphor of the machine destroying every other species except man can be viewed in two different ways.\nOne way to interpret the metaphor is as a subtle environmental message; the tank destroys all species on the relief, which can be seen as a criticism and a warning of how our technological advancement and growing economy endangers and destroys our environment, pushing many animal and plant species into extinction. \nThe second interpretation is much more in the spirit of the movie and was probably director’s true intention, rather than the somewhat less likely environmental message. The fact that the gunfire stops just before the word for human can be seen as a warning that our technology poses just as much of a threat to us as it is to our benefit. The idea that our technology, if not kept in check and handled responsibly, could be our demise is presented more directly by the tank itself nearly killing Motoko, but also by the actions of the Puppet Master; an extremely powerful rogue AI that is able to rewrite people’s memories and manipulate them at will. The whole technological aspect of the movie is supposed to show the viewers the infinite positive possibilities that the future holds ( after all, Motoko finds her answers in technology, sort of ), but also that there exists the other side of the coin and that while we shouldn’t restrain our technological advancement, we should also handle the technology wisely and responsibly.\nAnother metaphor expressed through visuals is the recurring motif of falling/sinking and jumping/emerging. The examples include the opening scene in which the Major jumps off a building, and the scene in the middle of the film where she goes scuba-diving. The motif of her sinking and then emerging to the surface is essentially the theme of rebirth I already mentioned, and the notion that one has to sink, abandon a part of their old self, before they can emerge and be “reborn” as a new person. The jump part of the motif(s) can be interpreted as a leap of faith that Motoko has to make before she merges with the Puppet Master. \n\nIf you are still with me on this review and haven’t yet been discouraged by its preposterous length, then bear with me for just a little longer, the end is near.\nAfter all this praise on Ghost in the Shell’s technical aspects and all the intellectual sustenance, I should point out some of the shortcomings, and these are mostly related to the plot and the pacing of the movie. \nThe greatest problem in this film is its relatively short running time – the whole movie is only 82 minutes long. While this wouldn’t be such a problem if the movie was merely an action thriller, the fact that a large portion of the movie is made of philosophical dialogue and action scenes means that there is relatively little time left to resolve the plot points. This results in a somewhat awkward pace of the film, with short scenes of expository dialogue followed by long scenes of intense action which are in turn followed by equally long scenes featuring no plot at all ( the aforementioned sequence of cityscapes and streetlife in Newport City ). Another problem with the plot is that the technological aspects of the world in which the story takes place ( i.e.the cyberbrains ) are not directly explained, and unless you’re familiar with the manga you have to figure these things out for yourselves, which can be difficult seeing as the plot progresses very quickly during the first half of the movie and you can’t afford to dwell on such thing for too long if you want to keep up with the plot.\nLikewise, the philosophical dialogue can feel unnatural given the scene and circumstances, and it takes away from the overall feeling of realism. However, this doesn’t bother me as much as it should, probably because of the nature and general atmosphere of the movie, so I can forgive them for dropping the sense of realism in order to properly frame and express the philosophical message.\nProbably the greatest problem with the plot though, isn’t the pacing or the heavy philosophical dialogue, but a certain plot point that isn’t satisfactorily resolved. I’m talking about the scene where Chief Aramaki orders the Section 9 SWAT team to storm the safehouse of Colonel Malles. In the manga this scene is much, much longer and it explains the motives and aims of both Colonel Malles and the Puppet Master during this affair, thus concluding the entire case. In the film, however, they cut the scene just as the Section 9 is about to storm the place, and what happens is never explained. While the outcome of the case isn’t crucial to the second half of the film or the ending of the story, it still leaves an impression that the case in the first half is incomplete, and it confuses the viewer, who has to extrapolate what happened for himself. \nAnd last, but not the least – the characters. Many reviewers complain about the supposed lack of character development in the film, but I find the main characters very well developed for a movie that only lasts 82 minutes. \nI have already covered much of Motoko’s character over the course of the review, so I’ll just add a couple of minor things. One interesting thing about her is that she appears to be an adrenaline addict; she frequently puts herself in risky and dangerous situations like jumping off the building backwards or fighting tanks on her own rather than waiting for support ( there’s also a bit of stubbornness in that ). Her hobby, scuba-diving, clearly shows this addiction to adrenaline. It’s a very dangerous pastime considering her cybernetic body has a titanium skeleton and therefore weights hundreds of pounds, and if the floaters she’s carrying break down, her body’s weight will pull her to the bottom and she will drown. She also appears to have a somewhat laid back attitude towards her nudity, having no problem taking off her diving suit in front of Batou, although it might be that she only allows herself such freedom in front of him, since the two seem to be very close.\nBatou is, after Motoko, the most developed character in the film, and serves not only as her trusted companion, but also as a contrast to her inhuman, somewhat cold and unemotional persona. While Motoko seems to have a knack for philosophy and is quite thoughtful, Batou is much more down-to-Earth and pragmatic. Even though his body is also largely cybernetic, it doesn’t make him insecure in his own identity, unlike the Major. He is much more confident in himself than she is in herself, and repeatedly has to remind Motoko that she really is human. This contrast between the characters of Motoko and Batou really plays off well and gives the movie some much needed dynamics in interactions between characters. It also appears that Batou has feelings for the Major than aren’t merely that of a colleague or even a friend, as he shows subtle signs of affection and care for her on several occasions. And even though he’s all tough and confident on the surface, when it comes to his feelings for Motoko he comes across as shy, hesitating to explain why he accompanied her on the boat when she goes diving, and then hesitating again during the final scene when new Motoko decides to leave. He also seems to have great respect for Motoko, averting his eyes when she undresses, as he respects her too much to objectify her. In fact, Batou’s character may be more developed than the Major’s.\nFinally, it’s over. I apologise for dragging this review for so long, but I wanted to make it as complete as possible, and Ghost in the Shell is a movie of such scale and depth that dissecting it properly takes a lot of time. I don’t think that there’s anything more to add, so I’ll just say again: Ghost in the Shell is a work of art that every anime fan, no, everyone who likes movies and visual media in general should see. There really is no other animated movie quite like it and it deserves its rightful title as a timeless classic. If you haven’t watched it yet - what are you waiting for?"},

It made all the difference. This is sci-fi done as it should be. Lots of ethical and philosophical musings on the advances mankind is making in the fields of science and technology tied up in a compelling, though admittedly very complex, plot concerning the hunt for a mystery cyber terorrist.\nIt looks great. The film is over a decade old now but it's visuals still hold up. The soundtrack is wonderfully atmospheric, there's terrific action, and generally there's a great\n          \n        deal of substance and intelligence behind it all.\nAs far as influence goes without Ghost in the Shell there probably wouldn't have been The Matrix either.\n        "},

Sit back guys, this is gonna be a long one.\nBefore I start this review, as this is one of my favorite movies and how it influences the way I act today, I'm going to take a LONG time to review it and I'm gonna talk a lot about it's philosophy and impact before starting the categorized review. Also, if you are somebody who really wants me to keep the philosophy in\n          \n        the dark for this movie, scroll past the first paragraph. Last QUICJK reminder, I will not go into any major (lol puns) plot spoilers, but I will have to give some minor plot details to movie it along. THX ;) \nGhost in the Shell is an amazing image of what anime can be, what it can do, what it can make you think and it does it VERY well. It's listed as one of the major reasons and inspirations for The Matrix, but honestly when I see the two, I don't see very much in common.\nYes there are some scenes stolen from Ghost in the Shell IN the Matrix, yes it deals with the same *general* ideas but really Ghost in the Shell takes it more maturely than the Matrix and doesn't spoon feed us with anything. I was shown The Matrix when I was five, and I had a basic understanding of what was going on. Had you shown me Ghost in the Shell at that age my main take away would be that there were boobs and guns and it was kind of boring.\nBut unlike The Matrix, there is more to Ghost in the Shell than guns, explosions, epic fights and basic philosophy. Ghost in the Shell dives deep, and in a strange way.\nThe main questions it pose are those about humanity and the human life, the lines that it draws and how that line blurs as we grow closer and closer to a technological singularity.\nNow, lots of movies like The Matrix would really try to hit that point hard by talking about it with lots of big words and while there is some of that in Ghost in the Shell a lot of the main Philosophy is obtained through visual symbolism, there are long dragging shots in the movie all throughout it that are while visually stunning, using the objects in the shot to convey messages.\nOne of my favorites is one of the more obvious shots near the climax of the film where Motoko (the main character) is fighting a battle tank in a large... I've never really figured out what it is.\nMaybe a conservatory or a ballroom? I don't know. Anyways, she's battling it out against this tank at the bottom of these stairs, this course of events leads to the tank shooting all the way up a tree of all the species of the planet, leading up to Hominis. \nAnd that scene hits hard, you almost immediately feel the impact that Masamune Shirow wanted you to feel. \nBut there is another very deep theme to the movie too, which is feminism. Not modern day, fuck all men feminism but talking about the objectification of women. I think that giving this a backseat to the main theme was an absolutely wonderful decision because it actually hits harder by slowly dawning on you throughout the film or maybe a second watching of the film. Another reason that this philosophy was an amazing addition to the film was because it really does work in the setting, our Character Motoko Kusanagi IS an object, the only original part of her body are some of her brain cells, other than those all her memories were transferred into her body, her organs are synthetic and so is everything else. It's just absolutely brilliant. \nNOW TO THE REVIEW!\nSo the story, much like in his manga acts like a car, taking the themes that he wants to present to you. That isn't to say there is no story, but be ready for a story that isn't the main aspect.\nThe story revolves around Motoko Kusanagi, our protagonist as she and the other members of Public security section 9* are working on a case, there has been a hacker called \"The Puppet Master\" hacking into people's brains and making them do bad things for him. But they can't catch him. Why? Because the virus he's using is too out dated for their high tech computers to trace. So this obviously poses a problem, and really the rest of the story is just them trying to catch this guy, gaining suspicions and losing suspicions. It's a very good story, just not the main focus of the movie.\n8/10\nThe art, on the other hand is absolutely stunning, it paints an almost real image of a populated city, billboards everywhere and pollution and smog everywhere you look, I can't really dive too deep into this one because you really have to see for yourself. But It's a \n10/10.\nThe sondtrack for this movie, written by Kenji Kawai is absolutely haunting, it fits every scene and it stays with you long after the film. It's amazing.\n10/10\nCharacter is tough, because since watching the movie about half a year ago I have gone to EVERYTHING Ghost in the Shell I could find, so because of my experience with Stand Alone Complex, something almost entirely based around the characters, I can't do this one fairly. I'll give them an 8/10 but really with everything else you should just watch this immediately and decide for yourself.\n8/10\nYou can see where this one if going, the film is just beautiful, from the art to the soundtrack to the themes and even the characters. They are just amazing and it is an entirely enjoyable film.\nAlso if you're watching this in a house where people sometimes walk in on your watching hentai/porn/stuff that looks like hentai/porn it would probably be safer to offer your entire family to come watch so that they know it ISN'T hentai/porn, even if it is uncomfortable you don't want them walking in on you. That is always worse.\n10/10\nOverall fantastic film, worth watching and watching again. See it for yourself!\n10/10 \n"},

Major Kusanagi embodies these fundamental questions of humanity. In the film, humans are recognized as \"unmodified\". In this way, Kusanagi is a cyborg because only his brain is human if one could say, a cybernetic brain, while his entire body corresponds to a structure of titanium or metal. Our protagonist and the movie eventually begin to question their existence and give us different points of view. What makes a person a person? Can you stop being a person? Can you become a person? Is there a spirit? And if it exists, what is its relation to the body? That I am? And it leads us to ask ourselves: What is the difference between man and machine?\nI highlight the good scenes and animation in which the protagonist despite not having or making facial expressions (obviously she is a android) we manage to reflect their feelings and ideas, in perfect shots that without need to tell us something we can feel what she feels , is incredible.\nSpeaking of the characters, the protagonist and Batou his partner are the most prominent with the villain of this movie, there really is not much background in most characters but it is normal to talk about a movie of 1 hour and 22 minutes ... apart from those two I emphasize much to the character Togusa and is that without a doubt is the most human in such a cybernetic world and this is reflected even more in the sequel to this film \"Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence.\"\nThe villain is complex and interesting, at first we were presented as a hacker nicknamed \"The Puppet Master\" hes hacked persons,robots (we remember that we now live in a cybernetic world where brain implants are normal) and forced them to do things, either steal, investigate, simply controlled, as well as hacked or entered classified government places, but we have an incredible turn and is that the \"villain\" is not a person, is an entity, an artificial being or intelligence artificial, initially known as project 2501 .. although he also denied that,since it feels and wants to seek to feel human, it reaches the point of asking for political asylum and being recognized as a person. It is considered an intelligent way of life because it is sensitive and can recognize its own existence, but it does not have the basic processes of the human being, such as reproducing and dying, here you can apply the philosophy \"I think, therefore I am\" or rather \"I think, so which I exist\" to summarize it is simple, if I am able to think for myself, then I exist. (Cogito ergo sum)\nThe goal of the 2501 project was to merge with the Major and become a new being able to be able to enter the network and obtain a higher existence and life and be one with the whole, obviously she has doubts and requires she to know if In the end she will continue being herself, the proyect 2501 tells Makoto that the desire to remain what she is, is what limits her. It offers to become part of all things.\nIt is interesting the turn that occurs of having shown us that she was looking for it, when in reality it was the 2501 project that I always look for her, another interesting point of the antagonist is how they showed it to us in an appearance or in a \"female body\" when her voice they were masculine, showing us clearly that this entity did not have defined sex or could not be defined as such, all these things make the antagonist one of the things that make this work what it is. \nOverall -Finally, it is a great work with a deep philosophy, a great animation with great scenarios that perfectly represents that world in which we live, with a very good musical atmosphere and the best, the development of the story, I give it 9 / 10 simply because nothing is perfect.\n        "},

This is not an action flick, even though the few combat scenes are visually stunning and well directed. \nGitS took my anime virginity back in '99 or so, but even though it tickled my curiosity, it turns out it wasn't the one that got me hooked on the anime artform per se. See, this movie isn't what you would call typical for anime as far as tropes, memes and dramaturgy go. It owes a lot to western stuff in that regard, mainly Bladerunner\n          \n        of course.\nCompared to Bladerunner though, GitS is superior in basically every aspect. It's deeper, more atmospheric, better looking etc etc. The only thing it lacks is Vangelis. Other than that, the only thing that stops me from giving GitS a solid 10 is that it's rather short. I usually consider this a plus, but a story this complex and deep needs time to bloom. This movie feels more like an introduction. Hopefully Stand alone complex et al will keep up the awesomeness, cuz that's where I'm heading now.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Story 10/10\nAction takes place in near future. Year 2029. Technology has advanced to a point where we cannot distinguish a human being from a cyborg. And that is probably the main question of the whole movie. It tries to answer it the whole time. What is life? What do we consider life? What defines life and human beings? These are the questions asked by the great philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Sigmund Freud. \nThe way the questions are being answered is quite original and not too harsh for a casual viewer who can still enjoy the movie without straining his brain. Generally speaking - the plot.\n          \n        The development is really thrilling and unpredictable. It begins with a terrorist disarmament and a car chase. And ends up with an epic battle which shows us the limit of humans. What should and should not be done by us. What can we decide ourselves, and what is determined by something we will never understand. And it is not meant for us to understand. \nThroughout the movie we get to see few episodes that are a combination of several landscapes of the city and an appropriate soundtrack. This builds up an excellent atmosphere. Makes us believe we are actually living in such a city where humans have advanced technology but are not living happily. This moots us another deep question. What is the purpose of technology? To make our lives easier? Then where is the limit to it when it only makes it more complicated? Haven't we already passed that limit?\nSo to speak, the plot is amazing, it has nice unexpected twists, action, atmosphere, dives down deep into human psychology and tries to answer philosophical questions asked since 600 B.C.\nArt 9/10\nI have to say I was really impressed. If we take into consideration the fact that the movie was made in 1995, it is outstanding. Probably the best art I have seen in such old anime movies. Character movements are really natural, I did not see flaws in there. But then again, I was too concentrated into the plot to catch a lot of details. The surroundings were detailed, but not perfect. I liked the views of the future cities. They were not too modern and polished like we imagine our future. It was realistic. Back alleys, thugs, trash old billboards. All of it created an amazing atmosphere where you can actually submerge into the world. All the action scenes were well drawn. The gun fights, car chases, etc. The background was not forgotten while concentrating on the rapid focal point like we see in many new animes. The nudity was done very well. It was not conspicuous. It was really subtle and pat. It is another detail that build up the atmosphere.\nSound 10/10\nI really loved the songs. Especially the ones played during those scenes where we got to see the city imagery. The sound made me draw a parallel between the future world and prehistory. Meaning that we only advanced technologically but not morally and mentally. It is still the same world. And humans have not changed inside.\nI have watched in the original Japanese Audio like everything else, therefore I will comment on the voice actors. I think they fitted characters well. I particularly liked the voices of Makoto and Bato, main characters.  I don't know why but it kind of fortified their personality.\nCharacter 8/10\nMakoto was a very well designed character. Even though it seemed that she had a ghost, she seemed emotionless when she needed to be. A sharp-witted mind of her lets her complete missions flawlessly. I don't how are all the cyborgs in that world but she seemed to think quite deep while not working. The conversation with Bato on the boat showed her true self, and emotional and confused creature. She is questioning herself the purpose of life, her origins, adaptation into the society and if she is human enough. And the fact that she is actually questioning herself like that makes her a human being. \nI am giving character development only 8/10 because it seemed that Makoto was the only one that was actually developing. All other characters were quite straightforward or pretty shallow. And Makoto herself was not a masterpiece.\nEnjoyment 10/10\nNow this is another part that Ghost in the Shell truly shines at. I really loved the way this movie tingled with my mind. This is not a movie that you can just sit back, relax and watch. It's an intelligent and complicated movie. And that is what I like. It might not be for everyone, especially the casual viewer. But even they will enjoy a movie as a pretty good Sci-Fi action thriller.\nOverall 9.4/10\nGhost in the Shell. Probably the best Sci-fi anime there is. It also surpasses many live action movies, like Matrix. Yes, it does not have as much fighting scenes as other movies we see, but that's why it is great. Anime is deep. It asks us what life is and many other philosophical questions. But it missed something to be a masterpiece in my opinion. A longer plot would probably drag it to a 10."},

Historically this movie is brilliant, and went on to inspire some amazing things. I completely understand why it gets all the praise it did. Especially back in 1995. But that said, Ghost in the Shell has aged very badly. \nStory: 8\nThe story and setting is by far the strongest part of the movie. I don't think any anime franchise since have explored these ideas in the same way. Nor have they explored them nearly as effectively. The ideas this movie has alone are worth watching. However, it\n          \n        did lose some points for some of the ending developments. I was watching this movie with a friend, and there was one particular twist that made both of us collectively face palm. There were also a few points where the symbolism became incredible un-subtle. However, the ideas that were executed well were executed extremely well.\nArt: 6\nThis is one of the most unevenly budgeted movies I've ever seen. There are three or four scenes you can tell they spent all of their money on. Aside from those three or four scenes, there are shortcuts everywhere. There are tons of shots from behind (so you don't have to animate lip flap) and many scenes where literally nothing moves. When the scenes were budgeted properly, they were absolutely astounding. Especially considering they were animated around 1995. But sadly, you can also see where the technology was limited by budget.\nSound:6\nDON'T WATCH THE DUB. This was dubbed pre-Cowboy Bebop. The voices actors are laughably monotone. Especially Motoko. I felt bad because a lot of the things they talk about are interesting. But it's difficult to take what they're saying seriously when they talk. The music is also very hit or miss. You either like it, or you hate it. They were clearly going for a very specific style.\nCharacter:6\nMaybe this is because I watched the dub. But it was very had to figure out what each character was supposed to be like. Motoko was obviously supposed to be very contemplative. Bateux was obviously caring but distant. And the Puppet Master was clearly intelligent. But aside from that, there wasn't much in terms of character. They weren't actively bad characters. But I certainly won't be remembering any of them for being break out characters.\nEnjoyment:5\nLike I said, this anime has clearly aged. I'm sure it was amazing back when it came out. But by today's standards it is nothing special. The pacing was incredibly slow, the animation was dated, and a bad dub doesn't help. You have to have a level of patience and forgiveness to actively enjoy this anime. This is not a good movie for your anime club. But it is a good movie for your anime historians club.\nOverall:7\nDespite my criticisms of this movie, people should still watch this movie. You may need some context about why this movie is so important, and what it did to media afterwards. But you should watch it. This movie is a movie that I respected more than I enjoyed. I respect it for what it did, and everything it was trying to be. I completely understand why it gets all the praise it has received. That said, I think new fans may need to understand its age and context to truly appreciate it.  \n        "},

For one, the sound and visual cues draw heavily from \"Blade Runner\" and the art direction is practically a re-skin. That being said, it looks and sounds gorgeous, and much like its inspiration, \"Ghost in the Shell\" is an enormously absorbing, hauntingly atmospheric experience.\nThe similarities between \"Blade Runner\" and \"Ghost in the Shell\" are not merely aesthetic, though; both works make humanity their primary focus -- specifically the question of what\n          \n        it means to be a human. Whereas \"Blade Runner\" takes an emotional, spiritual, perhaps even transcendental approach to the question, however, \"Ghost in the Shell\" follows a more cerebral bent. Let's consider the following: if you had the choice between preserving either your physical self or your mental self, which would you choose? Most of us would choose the latter, I imagine, for two reasons: on the one hand, roaming around as a mindless husk for the rest of your days doesn't sound like a particularly appealing fate, and on the other hand identity is an entirely mental quality -- a sort of psychological continuity comprised of a linear set of stages and the memories of those stages. When viewed in this light, the body becomes little more than a shell that houses the mind or the soul -- the ghost, if you will. Hence the title.\nBut enough about matters of identity. The film probes into these questions quite well, and though it doesn't offer any clear-cut answers, it doesn't have to. The challenges to our understanding of identity presented by this fictional world allow for ample inquiry into the nature of identity -- but again, this isn't really the ideal place to discuss such matters (that, and my mind is a little too frazzled to really get in-depth with any of this). With that in mind, I guess I'll move on to the obligatory run-down of each category.\n\nStory\nIt's nothing special, honestly. The premise is fascinating and the plot intriguing, but it flashes by too quickly to really absorb you. That, and the plot really isn't the primary focus of the film. The plot serves more as a vehicle for the ideas than anything else. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, since the questions it raises are piercing and worthy of consideration.\n\nArt\nStunning. Atmospheric. Again, highly evocative of Blade Runner. Like a neon dream. Not as absorbing as \"Blade Runner,\" but then again, no sci-fi world has ever managed to captivate me like Ridley Scott and Philip K. Dick's vision of Los Angeles did.\n\nSound\nThe voice acting is passable, but the music is outstanding. The visuals and the music together achieve a palpable atmosphere.\n\nCharacter\nThe characters in \"Ghost in the Shell\" are fleshed out far better in \"Stand Alone Complex\" given the fact that the film doesn't even last a full ninety minutes. The Major is the only interesting character of the bunch.\n\nEnjoyment\nAgain, it's the Japanese \"Blade Runner.\" What's not to like?\n\nOverall\nAs a feat of storytelling, it's not very tightly or compellingly told. As an audiovisual and cerebral experience, you'll find few things that surpass it in the realm of animation.\n        "},

The amount of praise and hype it has received is gonna be shoved off to the side for this review, but after watching it, I still came to the same conclusion that it's an excellent film. At first I wasn't that impressed, thinking it would be a robotic cop drama with action that pretended to be deep when really it was just high octane gunfights. But as more and more of the technology was revealed to me as the viewer, presented with a side dish of haunting operatic tunes,\n          \n        bone crunching violence, and existentialism, the movie jumped in quality significantly. Ghost in the Shell blends these things together really well, and I think it's what it does best. It ponders questions about reality, fantasy, the soul, and life in the form of beautifully drawn naked robot people and a great sense of setting that it presents. I don't really know why Motoko has to be naked when she assassinates people but it's probably the same reason you've only seen me bring it up, the audience can rawr at something.The characters like Motoko don't exactly have personality traits that make them horrendously interesting characters, but it's what happens to them that's important and interesting I guess. It's a shorter film, and my main gripe is that I wanted it to last longer, but the concept and world that Ghost in the Shell builds is deep are open enough to not only inspire entire film franchises such as the Matrix movies, but the bare minimum of concepts presented in the plot can invoke some pretty thought provoking conversations about the world presented in this mysterious, wonderful cyberpunk film.\n        "},

Anyways let's start shall we? \nStory(9): The story is set in the future where cybernetics has become commonplace and nearly everyone has some form of cyberization in their body. The story follows The Major, a cyborg that is part of Section 9, a section of the police that specializes cyber warfare.The story follows a The Major as she tries to take down The Puppet Master, a hacker, however other obstructions get in her way such\n          \n        as rival Section 6. The action is very good and you get to know the characters. Let me say without fault that the conclusion left you thinking. \nArt(9): The art of this time dates back to Akira. Which is not bad in any way in fact its pretty good.The animation is smooth and the action was slick. If you prefer modern art, then I suggest watching the remake(Ghost in the Shell 2.0, not Ghost in the Shell 2 Innocence, which is the sequel).\nSound(10): The sound is just absolutely brilliant leaving you feel chilly and awe-struck.\nCharacter(8): The character is just about the only thing I'm a bit miffed about. I didn't think they had enough time to develop all the characters but I hardly think that will hinder the movie experience.\nEnjoyment(10): I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, the movies made me want more after watching it.\nOverall(10): Seriously there's a reason why this movie is considered a classic among the anime community. Go watch it now. You definitely won't regret it.\n        "},

The only thing I really knew about it was that it had stunning visuals and interesting ideas. Oh and that it was ripped off by two brothers who go by the name of Wachowski. As something that inspired a movie so ingrained into our culture now I really wanted to like it. Hell I thought I would drop down to my knees and worship it. It could never live up to the expectations.\nIt’s so strange for a movie to be too slow in\n          \n        parts and yet also feel rushed. I’d say the movie doesn’t really get going until about halfway through. I know complex ideas and worlds need a little time to explain but I felt a lot of it was unnecessarily long. The other flaw with it is that the characters weren’t strong enough to really carry the film through the slower parts. Everyone just seemed to be on a monotone. Perhaps the dubs have a role to play in that. Though they weren’t exactly terrible or unfitting most of the time they lacked emotion. I know we’re talking about cyborgs here but I think there should be some emotion in their voices.\nA more detailed review can be seen at: http://nikkimanga.com/ghost-in-the-shell-review-movie/\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    Reading through the reviews of this film is honestly staggering; I cannot believe people have managed to uncover so much \"substance\" in a film so utterly lacking in it. Ghost in the Shell is, without a doubt, one of the most disappointing and overrated animes, and indeed films, I've ever seen.\nFirst of all, I'm going to say two words: Blade Runner. Ever heard of that film? It's an occasionally interesting, visually stunning but also very flawed sci-fi cult classic, and a source of obvious inspiration for the creators of Ghost in the Shell. And when I say inspiration, I really mean it. Everything from the\n          \n        cyberpunk character design to the gritty realism of the dystopic cityscapes appear to have been drawn while in the process of watching the aforementioned film. Here comes my only positive with this film- it looks brilliant (it's worth watching the birth scene of our main protagonist). The animation, if noticeably derivative (not only of Blade Runner but also the far superior Akira) is superb and really the only reason it managed to sustain my interest for as long as it did. Apart from that, this film is an incoherent mess from start to finish. \nLet's start with the plot. Or rather, the lack of it. It makes, and I'm not exaggerating, virtually no sense. I struggled to follow it from the opening shot of the film, which is really quite staggering considering how much of the diabolical script is taken up by pointless, nonsensical exposition. Honestly, the characters say SO much in this film without ever saying anything at all. There are several moments where the writers appeared to just be throwing in as many political terms as possible without even bothering to make sure they actually formed a sentence. There is no character development to be seen. Whenever the film-makers appeared to display any interest in fleshing out their leads, the already excrutiatingly inconsistent tone and pace of the film was bogged down by pretentious waffle about androids, the meaning of life and what it means it be human. Tackling such themes, when done well, has the potential to be very intriguing (again, watch Blade Runner) but here the delivery is so unbelievably terrible it genuinely made me want to stop watching.\nAnd here comes the nail in the coffin, at least for me personally, with Ghost in the Shell. It's not even an interesting mess of a film: it's mind-numbingly BORING. Even the action sequences feel contrived and strangely fragmented. What was most bizarre about the film was how utterly disconnected I felt as a viewer- I never once felt intrigued by what was happening on screen, or any real empathy for the robotic (in more ways than one) characters. It's frustrating, because somewhere in that rubble there's the potential for a watchable film.\nOverall, I really wouldn't be drawn into the hype. This fim's numerous faults make it one to miss. "},

These are some of the many questions that Ghost in the Shell poses, but yet does not have an answer to.\nSmartly, the film allows the viewers to come up with their own conclusions of the meanings of the film and it's ideas. It helps that the entire film itself is a masterpiece in it's own right - a great character piece about technology, identity, and the measure of a person.\nIn the year 2029, most of the world is connected by a vast network\n          \n        of information. Most people now have cybernetic implants on their bodies, now called their \"shells\" which house their personalities, or their \"ghosts\". Section 9, a anti-terrorist organization, protects Japan from a variety of cyber-hacking threats, including the recent Puppet Master (Iemasa Kayumi/Tom Wyner) threat, whose hunt is led by cyborg Major Motoko Kusanagi (Atsuko Tanaka/Mimi Woods) who has a special interest in his existence.\nHefty plot aside, Ghost in the Shell is a movie that requires your upmost attention. It's dense plot and philosophical implications will fly over the heads of some viewers, and while multiple rewatches will fix this, the film still requires a large amount of thinking. This depth gives the movie much more weight then it would have had otherwise, as the film otherwise is pretty simple \"AI gone rogue\" story.\nThis complexity also applies to it's characters, especially Motoko. Her quandaries about life and the nature of souls give her an almost sombre vibe about her. Her arc about finding herself is the crux of the film, and it allows for a strong emotional connection with her. Batou is a great foil for Motoko, having instead to have accepted himself while also being almost fully human unlike Motoko. This strong dynamic is what allows the film to truly shine.\nNothing would be this good without the film's breathtaking animation, however. From it's beautiful landscape shots to the fluid character movement, the film consistently delivers technically impressive and visually pleasing animation. This is compounded by action scenes that are intense, thrilling, but also filled with smarts, with each action being carefully calculated and planned out before everything starts, thus allowing it to feel realistic.\nVoice acting on both fronts is solid, with Motoko in both languages being the highlight. Sure Mimi Woods is no Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, but she gives a cold distance to Motoko that fits her quite well. Another standout is Richard Epcar as Batou, who is pretty much the definitive Batou in both languages. Overall both dub and sub are solid, so no need to freak out about what language to watch it in.\nLegendary anime composer Kenji Kawaii did the music for the film, and his score is rightfully legendary for this film. From the famous choir motif throughout the entire film to the somewhat electronic fused action scenes, his score is vibrant, haunting, and unquestionably fantastic.\nLed by fantastic voice acting, amazing technicals, and a deep, smart story about technology, Ghost in the Shell is among the best anime has to offer, and a great intro to the genre. A masterpiece on every front.\nI give Ghost in the Shell a 10 out of 10.\n        "},

The film makes the viewer ask questions but does not distract from the enjoyment of the movie. \nThe story, in my opinion, is not exactly revolutionary but the way the movie executes the story makes it\n          \n        one worth watching. Cyberpunk-esque themes are presented throughout the film in some ways subtle and some ways overt. Just how valuable is a human life and soul when it can simply be replicated with a new shell and downloaded into another cyberbrain? I mean, has anyone ever seen their own brain? Do we believe we exist only because of what our environment tells us? It encourages the viewer to put on their thinking caps and makes us ask questions of our own. Mamoru Oshii did not hold punches in the philosophy department, which I won't go into because there are other reviews that do a way better job at explaining it than I will.  There's also not a whole lot of time the movie spends explaining the universe. Cyberbrains, Ghosts, diving, all these terms may be overwhelming and confusing, but after a few rewatches (and a bit of Googling), one can make more sense of the technologies used in the film. However, for those that are not keen on sci-fi or cyberpunk anime, this movie may be very difficult to get into because there is not a lot of information dumping. For some, the lack of info dumping makes the movie more enjoyable as you make your own assumptions about this futuristic, yet modern, universe. \nOur heroine, The Major, is a brooding personality. A full cyborg, she ponders if she is simply a replicant, a copy made from a dead original. She is unable to leave behind genes or reproduce, adding only to her existential dilemma. She holds respect for authority, but is not a machine made to take orders. She acts on her own volition, makes independent choices, sometimes in a manner that's almost disrespectful. We get some background knowledge of the rest of the Section 9 crew, but not much is known other than what they show us on the \nsurface. Batou, Togusa, Aramaki, Ishikawa, all crucial members of the team, but the movie does not waste time getting into their life story (Stand Alone Complex/2nd GIG does a great job of that anyway). \nNeedless to say, the visuals are gorgeous. The details of the city and the backgrounds do not speak of a distant future, but feels rather modern. The skyscrapers dotting the landscape reminds me of bustling, modern cities such as Hong Kong where both tradition and future collide. I have to say Kusanagi's character design is one of the factors that keeps me coming back to this brilliant movie. No expense was spared in the artistic department. From the busy and noisy market, full of pedestrians each carrying about with their lives, to suburban city streets lined with shops, everything was incredibly well done with immaculate attention to detail.\nKenji Kawai's work with the soundtrack created a beautiful environment and added a sense of immersion when I was watching the film. The film's title sequence is probably one of the most memorable scenes, at least for me. We see the birth of Kusanagi through a machining and manufacturing process, combined with a beautiful Japanese chant which is repeated a few times throughout the movie. The chant highlights the marriage of human and machine into one being that is virtually indistinguishable from an organic human. The sound in the movie, for being nearly 20 years old, was very well done. \nAfter 7 re-watches, I'm still awed by this movie and I still enjoy it just as I did the first time. I \"dive\" myself into the music, the audio, the gorgeous but slightly desaturated visuals, and of course, the impeccably executed story and the identity struggles of our cyborg heroine. All these elements combine into, what I think, is a cyberpunk classic that every fan should watch at some point in their exploration into anime. Maybe you'll start to ponder your \"ghost\" as well. \nThanks for taking the time to read my (1st) review. "},

It became a huge inspiration to filmmakers like The Watchowiski Brothers, James Cameron and Ridley Scott, it spawned heavy positive reaction from critics and animation fans, and the film has become a worldwide masterpiece for anyone who watched this film when it came out. Seriously, just say the title out loud and everyone will go \"IT IS THE GREATEST ANIME FILM EVAR!!! WATCH IT NOW OR YOU WILL BE A ANIME NOOB!!\" So, I decided to see the film and all I can say after watching is this:\n          \n        Ghost In The Shell is a great film. Not an amazing masterpiece like a lot of people claim to be but a great film with an interesting story and social commentary about what if robots can have a mind of their own and possibly be more human than ourselves.\nBased on the manga by Masamune Shirow, Ghost In The Shell is about Motoko Kusanagi, a female cyborg soldier and leader of Section 9, that's trying to catch hacker simply named The Puppet Master. The Puppet Master can control anything like implanting false memories into another cyborg or even hack into any military system device at will and therefore, making him a real threat to the team and the whole city. So the race is on to catch this hacker but Kusanagi discovers that there's something much more to this hacker than just... Well being a hacker. \nWithout spoiling the whole story (cause If I do, I will get my head chopped off by GITS fans), it talks about the idea of robots having a conscious mind and with a conscious mind on the robots, it makes them more human than us, which is a damn good possibility since this is set in a future where technology is more advanced and powerful enough to create cyborgs as replacement if the human race will ever be extinct. I also liked The Puppet Master in this movie, which he is a cyborg hacker on the outside but on the inside, he doesn't want to destroy the world, he just wants to be something else than just a walking machine. With that said, my main problem with the film is that the characters are not that much interesting or well-developed. Yes, Kusanagi is a bad-ass cyborg soldier that can kick ass but on the whole, she's not that much interesting as a character in this film and I really wish that the writer could have given her like a struggle of trying to find the meaning of being human in a soulless body but here, she's just a soldier that can kick-ass, that's it.\nThe side characters are not much of help either. They feel like walking stereotypes that are just waiting for something big to happen and they're not very fleshed out either. Which is a big shame since I do like this one character named Batou, the cyborg with the augmented eyes, was really cool and the only character that I cared in the whole damn film. As for the action in Ghost In The Shell, it is really good but again, the problem is that there's barely a lot of action in the film. It starts with a very cool opening when Kusanagi takes down a bunch of cyborgs while invisible and it leads to the \"more talking, less action\" route, which I have nothing against it but they could have made more action scenes in order to have a balance of action and story. GITS has a lot of good story ideas going for it and it works but the characters are just boring as hell and there isn't enough entertainment value to enjoy it even more.\nBut I will admit that GITS is gorgeous to look at. It was done by Production I.G. and the animation is a real stunner for an anime film to be released in 1995. The detail of the characters to the incredibly good looking visuals and to the futuristic design, GITS is a masterpiece in the animation department and the scenes where they show-off the animation is simply beautiful to look at while the chanting plays in the background. Speaking of chanting, the music is really mesmerizing and it contains one of the best opening chant songs in film history, delivering a chilling sense of dread and mystery into the world of GITS. The dub is pretty good with Mary Elizabeth McGlynn delivering an awesome performance as Kusanagi, Richard Epoar doing a decent job as Batou and for whoever voiced The Puppet Master, he was excellent in the role.\nWhile I don't think Ghost In The Shell is a perfect film, it still delivers a very good story with a great idea to back-it up. It's just that I wished they could have developed the characters a bit better and to have the film a balance between more action and more story. If you missed out on the phenomenon that is GITS, go check it out. It's a fascinating film that will still be remembered for all eternity.\n        "},

I first saw the film back in 2010 after my cousin reccormended it to me and at first thought it was good but a bit confused espcially as I was only a casual anime fan at the time and was not into much at the time.\nBut then a few days later I was sitting in my college lecture and the intro music Making Of A Cyborg just seem to creaped into my mind and all day it was just stuck in my head all day. So i decided that night I'd re-watch it as i thought maybe\n          \n        re-watching would help get the theme out of my head. And the 2nd time I paid more attention to what was going on and I can say at that moment I had seen one of the greatest movies ever.\nTo start of the musical score in GITS is one of the best in not just anime but in any movie full stop I mean it is so good. As I said before how Making Of A Cyborg got stuck in my head its that good.\nThen there's the characters which for me is the main reason to watch this movie. I not going to mention every character but 2 characters stand out for me in the movie. Firstly Batou who is 3rd in command as a total badass and will put common sense before anything else but will do anything to help in brining in trying to bring down the puppet master. \nThe final character I will talk about is the main character Major Motoko Kusanagi (Total Badass). What can I say about her, she's great with a gun, class A hacker and kicks ass. In this film she is leading section 9 to try and capture the hacker callled the puppet master but at the same time she is not sure if she is what she is and even questions her own memories and existence but it is all part of trying to find the puppet master and not to spoil anything is very important in the final outcome.\nLastly i'm gonna talk about the animation. Nearly 20 years on and unlike a lot of 90's anime where the animation dose not hold up GITS animation still holds up and I think if you were to some up why a lot of Japanese animation is better than american style animation this is it.\nSo to some up Ghost In The Shell is a anime film I believe needs to be seen by all anime fans as its one of the main factors anime is popular outside Japan but also its just a damm good movie.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    It is safe to say that the Ghost in the Shell remains one of the most influential Japanese animated franchises in the West, and with its big-shot popularity it has generated a fanbase—with the likes of the Wachowski Brothers and James Cameron exalting its cyberpunk visuals and philosophical depth. Most recently, a 2017 Hollywood live-action adaptation starring Scarlett Johannson premiered, further solidifying its fame in the mainstream.\nMamoru Oshii directed the original GiTS film that spawned its behemoth of a franchise today, trimming most of the comedy from its source material back in 1995. With a film that's as critically acclaimed for its visuals and depths,\n          \n        it is normal for one to have high expectations—though not in the sense that an average moviegoer should have.\nGhost in the Shell 1995 is a slow burner—it is not a film that you regard as filled to the brim with action sequences and jaw-dropping fight scenes. Rather, it is a film that you approach and immerse with through its dialogue and the questions it brings up with each climactic moment. It progresses in a pace that not everyone would like, but to the ones who can take it in, it progresses steadily and allows you to think with the characters.\nYet with as much philosophical depth it supposedly has, it has an above average and straightforward plot that admittedly would not excel as much if not for its existentialist aspects. Even so, the story is not something to scoff at—as standard as it may seem today, keep in mind that Ghost in the Shell is one of the films that started this cyberpunk wave, along with the likes of Akira, Lain, and Texhnolyze. For what it's worth, it is still a pretty amazing cop story in its own right bathed with themes of politics.\nThe philosophical side of the plot is very appealing. It reaches out to the viewer directly and asks you questions. With the advancement of technology and we reach the time where body parts are dispensable, are we still the same? Could we consider our consciousness our existence? Is our consciousness still what it is?...I don't really know, nor I don't even know if those are the right questions it was asking me. I consider myself a critical thinker, and have pondered upon the themes explored in this film every once in a while, so it didn't strike me as anything complex. To each their own, but I believe Oshii's prior work Angel's Egg is more philosophical and cryptic in its essence.\nEven with its simplicity, the cast of characters are great and well-written, although I did not find myself to be as appealed as I feel like I am supposed to. For one, Motoko Kusanagi is a unique character that I think not everyone will feel attached to—but it is that uniqueness itself that makes her a good character to examine. I even think that the whole film is just one big character study for the Major, and her questions about her being \"human\" along with the interactions with the Puppet Master are very interesting scenes from the film. Batou is a good supporting character, and serves as a nice foil to Kusanagi's attitude towards her existence.\nA cyberpunk soundtrack that isn't cyberpunk—this is how I would describe Kenji Kawai's take on the film. Its diversity makes GiTS a very unique experience from usual cyberpunk media. It doesn't stick to technological-sounding schtick—rather, its music is more oriented to traditional crime thrillers that complement the film's reality-rooted elements, despite its cyberpunk aspect. It isn't abused, either—much of the film's best assets are the moments when it knows when to not have inserts, letting silence sink in the moment. The sound effects are topnotch, and I find it hard to believe that this was made in 1995.\nAmong the other things I find hard to believe that it was made in 1995 is its art and animation—while I have a bit of a problem with the Major's face design (although I guess that is acceptable since she is supposed to be a cyborg after all)—GiTS is a wonderfully animated film. From the backgrounds to the fight scenes to even the 3D parts—each of these aspects of the animation helps bring this dystopian techno-world to life. It's still dated, sure, but that shouldn't prevent you from addressing beautiful art.\nGhost in the Shell (1995) is overrated, indeed, but it very much deserves its classic status. Even to this day, GiTS pioneers the strong suits within its genre, and is one of the films that bring out the best in anime.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    What people take away from Ghost in a Shell can vary. Some people would argue that it's one of the best anime of all time, yet others would also say that it's story is unfocused and difficult to follow. Rather then picking a preverbal dog in the fight going into this movie, I sided to watch it without listening to anyones subjective opinions of it first. I didn't read reviews, I didn't do research, I just purchased the film and watched it. In my personal opinion this film is an interesting experience, but perhaps not as much a fulfilling story. Don't get me wrong, I\n          \n        really enjoyed this movies subject matter and imagery, but by the end it almost feels like I was only given half a story. As of right now I have yet to see the sequel Ghost in a Shell 2, so I don't know if any of the ideas expressed in this movie are further explored, but honestly that doesn't matter! A film shouldn't need a sequel to have a complete story. Granted this is only my opinion, many people think the ending to this film is fulfilling and meaningful, I was just personally disappointed with it.\nOn to other things shall we? One of the things I really enjoyed about this film was the fact it explored what it meant to be human. In a world were almost everyone has a  synthetic body, sometimes not even keeping more then a small part of the original brain, it would make sense for someone to start to question if they really are a person anymore. This is a really neat concept that I felt was explored in a entertaining way. I think that we as an audience would have been more invested if the main character Motoko Kusanagi had been slightly more relatable. She is robotic by design, meant to embody and explain most of what this world is supposed to be showing us. That isn't a bad thing, in fact I think they pulled it off quite well in the first act of the movie. When the story kicks in is were Mokoto loses me. While you might know a general idea of what she is trying to accomplish, you aren't let in to what she is thinking. Now this could have been a really interesting way of showing this character had she been to the side, but as your main lead the audience has to know where the lead is heading in the overall story. I'm not asking to be spoon fed, I just just wish I had a little more information. For the most part the rest of the cast isn't really that notable besides maybe Batou, a friend and coworker of Mokoto that actually does play a role in the story towards the final act. He does add a bit of demention to Mokoto that I appreciated.\nAs for the art and sound this film is probably one of my favorites in those categories. The art is both futuristic looking, as well as drab and degraded looking all at the same time. Being able to blend those two elements together shows a lot of skill and is very impressive to a trained eye. The art and imagery of this film are as important to telling the story as its dialog, which is why even though I honestly found the story of this film a bit underwhelming from a dialog point of view, I haven't chastised it. Like I said at the beginning, this film is an experience, and the art and music reflect this fact. After you watch this film your mind is supposed to be stimulated, and that is a big part of why I feel this film is so well received by critics and audiences alike. You could say 2001 Space Odyssey is poorly paced at points as well, but the way they showed it like that was on purpose, it was meant to get you thinking. When you focus on one aspect of a scene for what feels like a really long time, it gets the audience looking deeper into what they are witnessing.   And perhaps I am a little hard on this film, but I do think my complaints are warranted. Over all I did really like this, and I feel it is worthy of 8/10. If your lookng for a stimulating sit, try it out.\n        "},

So let’s get started!\nStory:\nIn the year 2029, technology has advanced to the point where people can replace their body parts and organs with cybernetic parts to make the weak strong and give people that are dying new life. In this world a woman named Motoko Kusanagi who is made up entirely of cybernetic parts has to hunt down a cybernetic being named The Puppet Master who has been causing trouble\n          \n        in the city. So Motoko and her team track down the Puppet Master to try to stop him with whatever it’s doing. I say whatever since the movie doesn’t really reveal much about what this thing is and what it’s trying to do and why it’s so bad. I’ll go into more about the Puppet Master in the section about characters so I’ll digress. The whole Puppet Master thing is the only straightforward plot point you really get in this movie since the entire time I watched it I almost had no idea what was going on. There were parts of the movie that asked if your whole body is replaced by cybernetics, how human are you and if you are just an empty shell without a soul which is something this movie likes to throw around a lot. My main problem with the plot is the fact that most of the time you don’t really understand the things that happen in this movie. This movie is really confusing at times but don’t let that turn you off since just because it is confusing and not clear about its messages, doesn’t make it bad. The anime Serial Experiments Lain is a perfect example of that. Extremely confusing but still a great watch. You have probably heard a lot of people say that this is the best anime movie ever made and that it is a classic, and from reading stuff like that I had high expectations. Unfortunately it seems my expectations were too high and the movie left me very disappointed. By the end it felt like nothing was accomplished and that not a lot happened. This movie is very short, clocking in at a brisk 83 minutes. With a short length and a very ambitious plot I think that maybe if this movie was longer, more would have been accomplished and it would have felt like a more worthwhile experience. Overall, the story was confusing and very ambitious which isn’t a bad thing but it’s something that I felt diminished my enjoyment of the film. \nCharacters:\nThe characters in this film are a lot like the story: confusing and not much was accomplished with them. First let’s talk about the protagonist, Motoko Kusanagi. In this entire movie we learn nothing about Motoko other than the fact that her whole body is made up of cybernetic parts. We learn nothing about her past and nothing about her personality. While normally this would be a bad thing if I were talking about some other random anime, but were talking about Ghost in the Shell, and in this movie I can kind of see why Motoko is like this. She is pretty much a robot with probably no human parts left of her so it would make sense why she is emotionless throughout the whole movie. And maybe we don’t know about her past since she was created the way she was just as an officer for the police. Although that could just be me theorizing since I don’t actually know if I’m right or not since I know next to nothing about the series other than watching this film. But if I am right then I would say in a movie like this an emotionless cyborg works since Motoko is just a shell. A ghost inside of a shell that either isn’t human anymore or never was one to begin with. The other members of her team aren’t really worth talking about except for Batou who is the second main character. He doesn't really do much though, other than be one of Motoko’s friend and a good secondary character. \nNow I’ll get back to talking about the Puppet Master. Well, there isn’t really a lot to talk about. We know even less about this being then we do about Motoko and I think he is the antagonist of this movie. I don’t know since I can’t really remember it doing anything evil. It’s just kind of there and nothing is ever resolved with him at the end. Another victim of the confusing as hell nature this movie has. Overall, the only good characters in this movie were the protagonists with my favorite being Motoko. The Puppet Master failed as a villain, if he was even played as one since I don’t actually know even though I am currently writing this directly after I saw the movie. The characters aren’t really this movie’s strong points, so I guess if I want to find out more I have to watch the other installments in the series. But in the end I’m not reviewing the other installments, I’m reviewing what I witnessed while watching this movie, and if we learn more about the characters in future movies then that’s great. But has of the end of this first movie, we learn absolutely nothing about anyone in this movie. It works for Motoko but not for any of the other characters and to me that is a letdown. \nSound:\nNow to one of the movies high points. The soundtrack in this movie is amazing to listen to as it fits so well with the dystopian future world that it is set in. Special mention goes to the song ‘Making of a Cyborg’ which plays at the beginning and is one of my favorite background songs in anime history. It is that good. Now to the voice acting. When I watch Ghost in the Shell I watched it in the sub. I normally do watch dubs but since I didn’t know anyone from the cast list, I decided not to watch it. The sub was good I think since I don’t really know if I’m qualified to judge Japanese voice acting and as of now I have not seen the dub so I cannot recommend one over the other. Even if, in the end the whole sub over dub argument for any anime is a very pointless and stupid argument. The sound effects were good to, especially when guns were being fired. Overall, this movie nailed it in the sound department and the soundtrack is probably my favorite part of the whole movie. \nAnimation:\nThe animation is another part where Ghost in the Shell excels. The animation looks great in this movie and it still holds up today even if you can tell that it is over 20 years old. I liked the character designs as well since they fit with the animation and the overall look of the movie. This movie also has a fair bit of nudity but it is never played for fan service and is something that adds to the maturity of the movie. Even if it is kind of unnecessary at times. The violence also looks great when it sometimes appears in the movie and wish there was a bit more since to me there is something unusually cool about half-human, half-cyborg people exploding into a pile of blood, guts and cybernetic parts. Overall, Ghost in the Shell excelled in the animation department and is another one of the shows high points. \nFinal Thoughts:\nTo finish off I will say that while it didn’t live up to the high expectations that I had for it thanks to all the hype I’ve seen surrounding it, Ghost in the Shell was an enjoyable movie with flaws. It excelled more in the technical aspect rather than the story and characters and it is a very important film in anime history. I wouldn’t say that this movie is a masterpiece in my eyes but it was overall a very solid film that despite all of my problems with it, I would still recommend that you watch so that you can form your own opinion or watch it just so that you can say you’ve seen it. I mean you can’t ignore how influential and ground breaking this movie was and while I can’t personally see that overly high praise this film gets it was still an enjoyable experience that I think everyone should witness once in their life, anime fan or not. \nRating: Good\n(My rating system is explained if you check my profiles main page. I hope you liked the review and look forward to more in the future. I will be reviewing everything else from the Ghost in the Shell series whenever I watch them so you can look forward to my opinions on the other stuff if you want to or not.)\nPeace out, Anime fans!

But nonetheless there are quite a number of moments involving full frontal female nudity (Some of it being out of sight because of the way the camera is positioned.) in Ghost in The Shell, which is one\n          \n        of the reasons that I put off watching it when I discovered it long ago. \nSomehow, a chance of watching it in legitimate ways arouse, and with the help of IMDb sparking my interest in the film, I saw it in my School Library where there are imported DVDs for loan and use inside the library only. There was sufficient time for me to finish it, but just so you’ll notice, the clear philosophy comes at the last, important sequences in the film.”\n“The Clear Philosophy comes at the last, important sequences in the film.” Means that the philosophy is still present in faint glimmers throughout the film. Not defined as a horror film, it contains a few disturbing images and some innovative, Science-Fiction themed visuals that are very cool and awesome. And the presence of philosophy is one of my keywords I have entered into my search engine when watching animated movies. I didn’t focus to like it, instead focus upon the dialogue, backgrounds and trying to unlock certain things that the film is trying to tell me. It is like trying to decrypt the numerical codes embedded in a philosophical film and the result is one of the most rewarding elements ever to be obtained from a film, something philosophical, rather than enjoyment that doesn’t last as long.\nSet in the Year 2029, A female Cyborg Cop named Motoko hunts for a hacker known only as “The Puppet Master”. She is a cyborg, and as I have mentioned above there were moments off full frontal female nudity, as it is because she takes off her clothes when she uses her camouflage device. Not just this, some other reason as well. But that won’t be mentioned here. This was done because it is the clothes that gives the camouflage away. Some of it is hidden, but some other are clearly visible. Wondering about what is the purpose of these moments, I kept drawing blanks. As I said above, what is the purpose of putting these things here? Even though it is nudity depicted on “Drawings”, I don’t think I can accept that at the moment, and I covered those moments with my hands at certain points to lighten myself up.\nThere’s a complex story, with a few High Tech looking science fiction visuals and concepts about life, artificial intelligence, identity and a few others of such things scattered throughout the film. However, I’m not certain if it is there or not. But since this review is from a single experience of the film, I’m not too certain of what the film has to say either. Somehow, the complexity is rather distracting, certainly not exactly enjoyable or likeable, but it wants to ask you some questions in certain ways. Though I felt that there’s more entertainment than philosophy here.\nCyborgs, machines, robots, some with artificial intelligence, can think like we do. But they are not sentient beings. However do they, fitted with the technology of manmade intelligence, have feelings of their own? It seems that this isn’t really answered in the film, what I saw was a bit of disturbance and some messages, but may I suggest that the enjoyment and learning experience that the film has given me are not on a balanced scale?\nNot being a fan of comic books in the past, I have grown to appreciate comics or “Cool Stuff” more and more, if I always go on and on looking for “What I like and what I don’t like”, that’s not gonna get me anywhere. Is all of that “Cool Stuff” that the critics or some people not define as “Art”? I don’t know. But I grow to appreciate good, non-explicit things. This film is still rather cool and high tech, and a visual feast like most Studio Ghibli films.\nYet the film left behind a cultural impact, parallels were drawn to a few modern science fiction films, such as “The Matrix” (Which I have seen). Instead of talking any further about the film now, I’m certain re-watches and more understanding of the dialogue, which is scattered with bits of philosophy throughout, will  bring me to more understanding about the film itself. Certainly it asks you questions, but like most anime, many prefer to enjoy themselves more than learn something. If you wanna enjoy yourself, go ahead. But perhaps only with multiple viewings of the film that one will come to deeper understanding of the film itself, which I wondered about its depth upon its human story.\nRanked #30 on the list: \"The Best Animation Films.

It seems straightforward, but it is not clear in Ghost in the Shell. Everybody in Section 9 has cybernetic enhancements, and in the case of Major Motoko, she is a cyborg that can have her conscience moved from one body to another if the body is destroyed. Is Motoko a human? This is the question that Motoko asks herself repeatedly throughout the film.\nGhost in the Shell provides a mixture of action with deep philosophical questions that could potentially come up\n          \n        in the future. It is impressive how the well the future is portrayed in a film that was released in 1995. More impressive still is that the film is based on a manga from 1989. The technology used in the film is fascinating to see. The story is well-written, the characters interesting and not one-dimensional. The one criticism I have for the film is that it could have been longer. There are a lot of complicated concepts brought up in the film and more time could have been spent on to explain these concepts.\nYou might enjoy this if: You want to find out why Ghost in the Shell is one of the original must-see anime films out there.\nYou might not like it if: You want an anime that you can just sit back and watch without having to think.\nNote to the Viewer: I would not recommend watching Ghost in the Shell 2.0. It is the same as Ghost in the Shell, but with poorly added CGI in various parts.\nUse your technology to find Fragglepuss.com for more anime reviews!\n        "},

It doesn't forget about cyberpunk's strength - philosophy - and that aspect Ghost in the Shell tackles in a rather thought-provoking manner.\nThe main plot is typical police thriller with detectives and bad guys, although it can be engaging it's not enough. Fortunately, this movie has a subplot and that subplot is an existential crisis of the main character - Motoko and it's handled very subtly. A Hidden gem I could say. Combine these two plots and you get a great story about effects of\n          \n        cybernetisation on politics and individual lives.\nPuppet Master is a computer program that became sentient and he is a link between these two plots. He thinks Motoko can help him and Motoko thinks he can help her. While it makes you think about those philosophical questions and how they affect you I think they're rather aimed at the characters and not viewers. In my opinion, viewers are supposed to observe how characters are coping with their existential crisis and how it affects and develops them. These two approaches are what makes this movie a masterpiece.\nCinematography plays a big role in this movie. Action scenes consist of rather short shots but when the movie is focused on philosophy and symbolism shots are long and wide. Long shots focused on beautiful backgrounds greatly enhance the observing part and create a unique atmosphere of a vast overpopulated city.  Cinematography also uses subplot's narrative to show us how Motoko views the city. I always considered pre-2000 art style and animation to be the best and that movie didn't disappoint me. With its excellent design of guns and vehicles, it creates very convincing sci-fi world\nLet me also talk about side characters and world building. The viewer is thrown into a big sci-fi world with little to zero explanation on what and why is going on and while it can get confusing I don't think it's flaw. As I said earlier we are meant to be observers and this movie mostly uses \"Show, don't tell\" technique and you don't really need to know a lot of this world or side characters to get the message although I must admit that it really depends on how quickly you catch what's going on.\nOn the surface Ghost in the Shell is a police criminal set in a sci-fi world and at its core is a thought-provoking piece of art that has inspired a lot of great sci-fi movies like The Matrix. Whether you like sci-fi or not you should watch Mamoru Oshii's the best and the most popular movie. Rate - 10/10"},

Are they human souls or conscience? There are a lot of plot hole in the film.\nArt: 10/10\nDespite being from 1995 (or maybe it's because I watched it in HD) the art is just the most beautiful thing in the whole film.

It is a concept commonplace in the cyberpunk sci-fi genre. Ghost in the Shell is one of the forefathers of this concept and it has inspired henceforth other films and series following its footsteps, such as the Matrix, Serial Experiments Lain, etc. \nStory: 8.5/10\nThe story is overflowing with symbolism and rich philosophy. Questions about the existence of the soul inside the machine (hence ghost in the shell) are discussed between the main characters and let me tell you something. This story is deep.\n          \n        It is not for those who prefer easier and more digestible titles. Not that they have a worse taste or something, but if they see this movie, they will not appreciate it as much as a person interested in depth and philosophical context in movies. Overall, the plot is ok in comparison to other titles in the genre, but its symbolism and philosophy bring it up a notch, since it becomes a more distinguishable title than others. If the Matrix is appreciated for its action, then GtiS stands out for its depth in philosophy and symbolism.\nCharacters: 8.1/10\nThe characters were very simple as personalities since they are all cyborgs, however, all of the philosophical content in the story derives from the discussions between the main characters. One aspect of the movie that I really loved was Mokoto Kusanagi who questions whether she really had an existence before turning into full cyborg. She is the main focus of the story and she will remain for me as one of the most memorable female leads due to her lack of identity which she questions.\nArt/Animation: 10/10\nThis movie is drop-dead gorgeous every frame is beautiful, the character designs are very well done and unique and the action scenes are very clean and well-choreographed. \nSound: 10/10\nThe ost overall reinforced the experience of the universe of GitS. It brought a very sad and melancholic vibe. It fitted to the tone of the film. The sound effects are also pretty good for the times.\nEnjoyment: 7/10\nIt took me three sittings to watch completely the movie. At some points, but overall it is a very good movie and it pays great homage to the genre it represents.\nOverall Score: 8.72/10\nAlternative recommendations:\n-Psycho-Pass for the futuristic dystopian universe although it is not as well-done as GitS.\n        "},

It’s about hackers, brainwashing and the concept of blurring the line between human and machines.  The future might be filled with these things, but a special unit called Section 9 will make sure that the future of Japan is secured.\nOr was it Hong Kong based on the scenery?\nAnyway. I’m going to tell you right from the bat, if you expect this to be mainly about action, then you\n          \n        might be turned off.  This is a thinking man’s action movie that brings up allot of philosophical questions. \nYou know, the one who would later on inspire the Matrix. It has many slow moments, but also treats its action with the energy it deserves. \nCharacter:\nMajor Motoko Kusanagi, the main character in this movie and leader of section 9, is different than her other interpretations. I call her Major with Identity Crises because how serious and tuned down she is in comparison with her manga counterpart. Even if she is a human with full prophetic body, she sounds and stares like a robot which makes some scene uncontrollable, especially with the Kubrick stare. \nArt & Enjoyment & Sound:\nThis movie has probably the best-looking anime for it’s year with a stellar soundtrack and includes many iconic moments such as; the opening scene, the fight with thermo-optic camouflage, those many fingers and the climactic battle with a walking tank. However, this movie builds heavily on the scary thought that a new entity can be created from the vast digital information, again like the Matrix.\nOverall:\nOverall, this anime is very mature and ask the audience what they think is a ghost. For example, there is a ton of nudity in this movie. However instead of acknowledge it as something sexual, it’s basically saying: yes I have a chest, what about it?\nI might not be so keen to always pick this movie up, but if I ever want to point to an anime that proves the industry can produce an animated movie that has thought provoking messages. Then I’ll always point to this classic sci-fi movie.\nIt’s also scary how this movie about objects coming to life was released the same year as Toy Story."},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I enjoyed the ideas that this movie presented.  What if humans are part computers in the future?  What moral/political/emotional, etc. problems does that cause?  What is the definition of \"human\"?  All very deep and important questions, especially in our generation, in which technology is growing at an exponential rate.  I would categorize this as science fiction, but it's almost like the opposite of historical fiction... futuristic fiction.  (Haha.)  By that I mean it's not just made up.  It's based on a situation that could very well present itself in the next hundred years. For that reason, it's\n          \n        a profound piece of artwork.  The ending was very open ended, which I personally did not enjoy, but that's just personal preference, I suppose.  I suppose it's intent was to leave you to think about it.\n\nThe artistic interpretation of the future is phenomenal.  It's one of those beautiful cityscape animes that we all know and love.  \nI did not find the sound to be anything special... Mostly because I didn't notice it. \nThe only characters I really ended up caring about were Kusanagi and the puppet master.  Even then, they were a bit cold and difficult to sympathize with.  Though I suppose they were part or completely computers, so that makes sense.  \nEven though I acknowledge that this is a well-made movie, I personally did not enjoy it much.  I found it to be slow moving, and it didn't have enough passion to make me care enough about what happened.  It was over very quickly, and I felt that it lacked sufficient closure.  I recognize that not all movies have complete closure, but I would have liked a little more.  Also, I felt as though it lacked actual substance and that it was predictable.  If you read a synopsis before you watch this, you'll pretty much have everything spelled out for you.  \nThat being said, you'll definitely enjoy this if you're into hard-core sci-fi and futuristic anime.  Even if you're not, I would say it's worth watching.\n        "},

I felt deep empathy for Project 2501, to be born into the world, but not truly able to die or replicate, the only of its kind. All it wanted was to be granted what not just everyone desires, but what every living organism innately desires. The function is\n          \n        so intrinsic, that its drive even exists in individual cells.\nHow lonely and isolating it must feel to be the only one of its kind, and to not be able to bring more of its kind into existence. To be the first and last. I can see why Project 2501 did everything in its power to reach Motoko.\nIt was not trying to preserve itself, it was trying to preserve its species. \nIt was willing to die, as long as it was able to give offspring, to make another of its kind. \nIt's quite religious if you think about it, Motoko, the mother of a new species of intelligence.\nAnother thing that i simply loved about Project 2501, was its utmost honesty and transparency with Motoko. When Motoko asked, \"Will i still be me?\". It could have simply told her that yes of course you will still be you. But no, it showed nothing but honesty, even in the face of the possibility of denial of its only true goal. Such honesty you only find in beings truly seeking their purpose. Motoko saw its honesty, its drive, its pain, and its fear. Motoko saw that Project 2501 was still in some sense very much a child, in the fact that this world still seemed so distant to it. It knew and had access to so much information, to literally everything. Yet it felt so distant, so disconnected from the world. As if it didn't belong and there was nothing it could do to become apart of it.\nProject 2501 looked out into the world, and it thought about its existence and its place in this world. Then from those observations and thoughts, the only thing that it could desire..was to have a child of its own.\nMotoko also felt a deep connection with Project 2501, because she was experiencing the same feelings as it had. She was questioning her place in this world, who was she? What was she? Her realization that she too couldn't even produce offspring was probably the deepest connection she had with Project 2501.\nWhether she would still be herself or not, i think deep down, she was willing to give up everything to have a child she could call her own, even if it meant death right then and there.\nAs even if they plucked her neurons for genetic information and used that to grow a child with similar DNA as her. A human child would still not be her own though, because in many ways she does not identify as human. The technology that makes up her body, is very much apart of who she is, her consciousness. She felt just as Project 2501 felt, that she was a separate species, deprived of the most intrinsic property of all life, the ability to make offspring, to multiply into a never ending tree with seemingly infinite branches of diversity.\nOn another note, I also love the relationship between Batou and Motoko, there is something so genuine about their relationship. They clearly have some romantic pull towards each other yet, Motoko could have any body she want's. It truly shows that Batou is in love with her mind, not her body.\nI hope you enjoyed reading this just as much if not more than i enjoyed writing it, thank you. \n        "},

In essence, this film takes an ambitious leap in attempting to portray intricate and confronting themes surrounding reality and fiction.\nThe premise of this film is set in the near future (2029) - this futuristic environment allows the film to manifest the complexities surrounding the human condition through the protagonist's struggle to comprehend her humanity amidst her cyborg existence.  \nThe art style within this film is a masterpiece - considering the time of production, this film does an excellent job in beautifully portraying a futuristic society.\n          \n         In addition, the soundtrack and underlying musical undertone does a fantastic job in shaping the mood and presence that the film deserves.  \nHowever, although the character development is a strong point in this film - the film lacks an effective representation of what exactly it is trying to convey.  Nevertheless, this film is able to set up the foundation of what could be a philosophical journey of the human condition - yet the execution of this is seemingly blurred in the drawn out action scenes and unnecessary dialogue.\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for a film that revolves around the nature of struggle and acceptance while not slacking off on the action - then this film would be right for you.

Mamoru Oshii's 1995 film \"Ghost in the Shell\". \nNote : (It is heavy on spoilers so be sure to watch the mivie first before reading this.)\nCharacters 8/10\nIn the age\n          \n        where death can be prevented through transferring your \"Ghost\" (Brain) into your desired \"Shell\" (Robot)\nthe story follows Major Makoto Kusanagi and Section 9 as they follow this world renowed Hacker which goes by the name \"Puppetmaster\" who started hacking politicians for unkown reasons.\nFirst, I'm gonna start off with Major Makoto, who is having an existensial crisis if her \"Ghost\" is really hers or it is just copied from one of the million cyborgs here in this world, she can't define the blurred line of being human to a robot. \nNow for the \"Puppet master\", he is a renowed hacker who always play with police with Unknown intentions, until later, he is revealed that he is just a program for for \"Section 6\" for which he will be used for creating the perfect existence (this part is really self explenatory so this is just my own conclusion). With no goal on his mind, his curiousity kicked in and started collecting data, then he also builds his own existensial crisis, he started to think on what it really feels to be a human and gathered collected data on how to become that. Then he became interested with Major Makoto which we all know is having the same problems, so he created a scenario where they can meet by throwing himself into the police then creating a fuss so that the section 6 and 9 will chase him, then his plan commences by telling Major Makoto that both of them needs to merge so that they can give birth to a \"perfect being\" (just like human who do sex so that they can give birth to a child.) which will result to their own evolution and thus becoming a \"human\".\nThough, sadly to say, most of the characters felt bland and dry (except for Major and Puppetmaster) like it feels that they didn't have character development and some of them became forgettable due to short screentimes and which is really a letdown after all the work they have done between the two Main characters.\nVisuals and Music 10/10\nProduction I.G did a hell of a job on this, the animation is really good which in my opinion is even better with Gainax' Evangelion (which is considered one of the best animated series of their time which is the 90's). Credits also Mamoru Oshii for his godlike visual storytelling and cinematography which feels like you are watching a movie from Hollywood, the fight scenes were really spot on and is oozing with coolness. The SFX is also really good which perfectly sets the tone for its setting and its Opening song that really gives me the chills on my spine whenever I hear it.\nOverall thoughts 9/10\nI gave this a 9/10 because the message it portrays is very thought provoking and it very realistic as far it goes. Plus the fact of how beatiful the effort given by Momoru Oshii on how the visuals look stunning just makes it a borderline masterpiece if it werent for the flaws like Some if the characters are dry and bland and poorly characterized and lack of exploration on their technology and how it became used in their society.\nOverall I recommend this to everyone who loves shows Like Serial experiments Lain or Texhnolyze since both of those two has gotten some inspiration from this Franchise.\nI hope you've enjoy this movie and also the review :)"},

Looking through it, you can safely forget about traditional Hollywood \"porridge\" from shots. Plans, shots, actions are replaced smoothly and evenly. However an atmsofer quite gloomy, intense and causing associations with the nuary. Such image is created by a city dullness, gloomy remarks of characters and a certain block of action. And, only you having seen at the beginning of the film shots with green figures, in the head there is an image Neo with agents Smith. :) \nCharacters act practically without emotion and always truly and coolly choose the best exit from current situation. There\n          \n        is illusion of that not only the outside world is computerized , but also internal. Such reception authors masterfully stretch main thought through all film - identity of artificial reason and the present. \nDeep, but on sense it is not loaded. But after all nevertheless difficulty is present at this film. This cybernetic history is overloaded in respect of the text. In other words, characters prattle with each other too much. But in thoughts of characters there is a reason share. Certainly \"Ghost in Shells\" it is impossible to call a store room of new post-philosophy, but it is possible to take pair adequate ideas from there. \nConcerning music. In this plan, the most serious blockbuster could envy this film. The scene (certain \"interval\" between conversations of heroes) with city landscapes especially pleases. Composers tried! \nAnd time speech came about concrete scenes of the film, it would be desirable to mark out one of them. That moment when to the dustman say that all his life, all that he considered present is only a fruit of imagination of the Puppeteer which forced the guy to believe in this invention. Present, as far as it is terrible to understand that you are actually anybody and achieved nothing. You aren't a person, you are the tool in hands someone. \nFilm is rather interesting, but specific. To understand it - means to undersign for own erudirovannost.\n        "},

But hey, there's robo tiddies in the first 5 minutes.\nThe plot is dense af. I watched it twice and still don't know everything that's going on, at least in the world but I get what the protagonists are trying to do. They only\n          \n        got 90 minutes to do that though and at the same time they actually have to have a plot, so I'll give them credit for squeezing what they could. That's why a good quarter of the movie is playing traditional Japanese music while showing incredibly detailed pieces of art depicting the city the film takes place on that has nothing to do with what Major and the other guy are doing.\nI like how they live in this fictional universe where robots get their own everything. Robot food. Robot clothes. Robot jobs. Even robots have their own kinds of sex. They make it sound like they're oppressed but in actuality they gave the Major some nice robo tiddies, so some respect was given in regards to their fleshy counterparts.\nNo memes here, it's a great movie to watch for the art of it. The plot is incredibly dense so it might be a bit too heavy for some people. I happen to adore sci-fi and fiction that addresses the concept of humanity so I thought it was a really good experience.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    This visually stunning, high-minded anime explores the nature of human identity in a near-future world where cybernetic implants, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality mean even one’s own memories can’t be trusted. If you are defined by your memories, and your memories are altered or even deleted like a file on a computer, then are you still you? What happens if a computer program becomes self-aware? Is it alive? Can the human “soul” live on if all its surrounding flesh (including its brain) is replaced by cybernetic housing, like a “ghost” in a shell? Could a self-aware computer program and a digitized human soul procreate and\n          \n        join the wheel of evolution? These and other existential questions define “cyberpunk,” a sub-genre of science fiction further demonstrated in William Gibson’s novel Neuromancer, and in films like Blade Runner, The Matrix and relative unknown Dark City. Though I’d recommend Ghost in the Shell for raising these issues alone, it does have some weaknesses. First, the voice acting, while above average for anime, is dragged down by the stiff performance of thelead actress. Second, the plot is so unnecessarily complicated that I suggest watching/reading all the available Special Features before viewing the film (don’t worry, it won’t spoil it.) Finally, underwritten and impatient with its own intellectual and spiritual themes, Ghost in the Shell at times resorts to distracting philosophical monologues. This could have been avoided with deeper characterization of the lead characters and further development of their relationships to each other. Despite its flaws, Ghost in the Shell is a great anime if only a good film. (B-)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Ghost in the Shell is one of THE most popular anime films ever. While lacking in character depth, it more than makes up for it with mouth-watering animation and sound, along with a typical thriller plot boosted by philosophy beautifully woven into the narrative.\n[Story - 8]\nThe plot itself is actually straightforward - a political/spy thriller in a gritty urban setting with cyberpunk themes. While not quite worthy of all the praise by itself, it is significantly elevated by the philosophical themes that are brought up throughout the film such as 'at what point does a sentient being stop being considered a non-person and start being\n          \n        considered a person?' and 'how can one define oneself in society where everyone is capable of sharing each other and merging with one another?' These two components surprisingly go hand-in-hand, and make for a rather riveting watch - it was fun to stew over these concepts while watching gorgeous scenery and action.\n[Art - 10]\nDefinitely the MVP of the film, and for good reason. It's over 20 years old as of this review, but it's aged just fine! The (well-documented) animation process has paid off well, with the attention to detail and subtle colour/lighting palette further enhancing the rather somber mood of the movie. The action is beautifully rendered (particularly the hand-to-hand in the rain), and the various pieces of technology shown are rather intriguing to see. No complaints here.\n[Sound - 9]\nWhile not as universally appreciated, I found the sound in this movie to be done extremely well. The soundtrack is rather intriguing: while not as noticeable as you may think, it definitely fills scenes with both tension and peace. The intro song is rather haunting, especially when paired with the intro cinematic. The same can apply for the outro too, but that is only accompanied with credits, so it was not as impactful for me.\nThe voice acting in this movie is pretty capable: I have only seen the original Subbed version of the film, but the seiyuus have definitely put in good work. The Major's seiyuu in particular fits her melancholic character rather well, and Batou's seiyuu compliments his nicely with his gruff-but-human character. \n[Character - 7]\nProbably the weakest part of this movie, unfortunately. Major Kusanagi is actually well-rounded despite how little she reveals of herself thanks to her various musings and identity crisis, but everyone else is rather lacking. The only other character worth remembering is Batou, and that's only because he shared 3 emotional scenes with her. I understand that this film is more of a thinkpiece rather than being character-driven, but I feel as though the themes would have been fleshed out even better with more developed characters.\n[Enjoyment/Overall - 9]\nI honestly don't regret staying up late at night to watch this film, and I would even say it is better enjoyed as a midnight movie. It was engaging with its volatile action, yet rather thought-provoking with the various questions it posed for the viewer to think about as we approach a more technologically-inclined society. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys cyberpunk and/or discussions about the ‘definition of humanity’ in fiction.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    For some reason I doubt we’ll see Scarlett Johansson topless in the live-action version of this.\nStory:\nGhost in the Shell asks the question what life actually means. What is life? Where does it begin? Is life always biological? Is self-awareness a sign of life? Can artificial intelligence come alive? When do you stop being human? Do we have a soul? That’s a lot of philosophy to digest for the viewer. Packed into an exciting science-fiction thriller, all these questions and more are asked, but none of them get an answer. And that is the strength of this movie. You don’t always need to give us an\n          \n        answer, some people are able to think for themselves (even though Hollywood seems to think otherwise). We are given arguments for and against the ventured guesses and it is up to us to form our own opinion. But let’s take a step back and look at the story we are presented. A government department that is apparently responsible for handling cyber-terrorism is hunting for somebody called the Puppet Master. Along the way it becomes apparent that the foreign ministry is deeply involved in this case. The main character has another reason to catch the Puppet Master. If we look at GitS as a sci-fi movie, it is a standard story, that is well written and builds up to an exciting climax. It’s not for nothing that this is considered one of the best anime movies of all time and even though we are past the time were cyberpunk was fresh and en vogue, it is still able to captivate the viewer and entertain us all the way through without trying to ask for a dissertation in philosophy to understand.\n10/10\nArt:\nThis movie still looks amazing after more than 20 years. The effects are something that could be done exactly like that in a modern work and it would still look good. The animation is as solid as one is to expect from a movie of that era. The character design is quite detailed and more on the realistic side than modern anime. The Majors design is somewhat inhuman, especially those huge blue eyes. Looking into them feels uncomfortable, which is likely what the creators intended. The best thing however, are the parts with the city impressions. The city is modelled after Hong Kong, which in real life already has somewhat of a dystopian feel to it and is the perfect background for this movie.\n10/10\nSound:\nThe soundtrack of Ghost in the Shell is simply amazing. In a stark contrast to the high-tech city and people in this movie, the music has kind of a tribal feel to it. The most remarkable track is surely “Making of Cyborg”, the song that plays over the opening credits. Combined with the sound effects, the whole opening sequence is one of the most recognizable scenes in anime history for its eerie atmosphere and stunning visuals. Besides the fantastic music, the voice acting is also spot on. Most of the time the characters talk normally, there is no big screaming or much of an emotional outrage (with few exceptions), so it’s important for everybody to have a normal tone. A slight criticism I have is that sometimes, the dialogues are just too quiet.\n9/10\nCharacters:\nThe characters aren’t the most important thing in this movie, but that doesn’t mean they are completely meaningless. The Major starts out as a loyal and able agent of section 9, but even early on we get a glimpse of what eventually develops into her acting on her own free will. She seems to be in constant conflict with her own humanity (or inhumanity) and seeks an answer to the question what she herself is. The Puppet Master is a great counterpart to her, whom I can’t really say much about without giving away major spoilers. Major Kusanagi is a great example on how exposition and tons of dialogue are not always necessary to understand a character and her motivations. Sadly, the heavy focus on her lets the rest of the cast fall a little flat, with the exception of Batou. Batou also serves as some kind of contrast to the main character, as he seems to be more “normal” on the one hand, but on the other he is much less interested to question the status quo.\n8/10\nEnjoyment:\nGhost in the Shell is a great movie and I’d go so far to say that it is a must for any anime fan, no matter what genre you prefer. I, for example, am not the biggest fan of science-fiction (though I don’t hate it either), but I had a really good time watching this movie. If you crave for something thought-provoking but want to avoid pretentious works, Ghost in the Shell is a great choice. To be honest, it may take a little while to get into the story, but once you’re in, you’ll be thoroughly entertained. If you are into visuals, this should be very high on your plan to watch-list (if you haven’t already).\n9/10\nOverall:\n9.2/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    Before watching this I heard that Ghost in the Shell was a classic and a must watch.  So when I watched it I was expecting something spectucular and did not get that.  \nStory 7/10\nThe story of this movie focuses on questions about life such as \"What defines life?\" and the difference between man and machine.  Granted this movie presents these questions well however I think these types of themes have been very overdone in the scifi genrre so it wasn't that new of an idea to me.\nArt 7/10\nPersonally I am not a fan of the art.  However I give it a\n          \n        7 because it is an older anime and when it came out was probably industry standard or better.  \nSound 8/10:\nI saw this dubed and was impressed because even though it was an older anime the dub fit really well with the charcters.  One thing that sticks with me is that the main charcter spoke robotically that probably was done on purpose and can be talked about with the themes.\nCharcters: 6/10:\nImo the poorest part of the movie.  They were very 2d charcters and for a movie that is rated as a classic expected a lot more here\nEnjoyment 8/10:\nBeing a sci-fi fan I did enjoy this movie and I don't mind thinking deeply about things either so it was still entertaining to watch.\nOverall 7/10\nI do think it was a good movie and a good anime, however I expected much more for being such a classic.\n        "},

And u can call me a huuuge anime freak !! I would not call this a review, more a guidance to if u should watch it or not  \nIt's a very artistic and philosophical movie... which means it's not for everyone !! Not everyone will get it.. not everyone will understand it.. and for a movie with such high praise, there will always be prejudice and criticism.. This movie did not touch me with all the philosophical stuff and all the questions asked about life.. but I can\n          \n        see how it did for others !! For meh... for something to be deep, u really have to care for the characters and really understand them. And this is where GITS failed. The Major was made to robot'ish to really care for her feelings and what she questioned (Am I a robot, or am I  human just cause ppl treat me like I am). In my eyes, she was just a robot and her ghost (soul) could always get another body.. so I didn't really care to much for her... The thing with the Major never blinking was made purposely... cause director Oshii wanted her to look more like a doll... it just didn't work for meh... Human emotions are a part of what makes u human, and In the movie... The Major is more robot than she is in the series... so no empathy on mah behalf...\nThe animation, the plot and how creative things are done was what intrigued meh. (what makes u human!?) I'm also a huuuge fan of creative artists using others's materials and making em their own. (like a true japanese).  There are aloot of segments in the film which f.eks inspired people like the wachowski brothers to make The Matrix (they even stole some scenes, right of the bat)!! And some scenes in GITS are just groundbreaking to look at !! Not to mention GITS is hugely inspired by Neuromance and Blade Runner !!\nPicture this movie coming out when u were older... u had never seen anything similar to it.. not anything even near it.. and u watch it for the first time !! It's mesmerising, groundbreaking, tansparent !! That's why this movie is considered so highly rated.. It's easy for people like me, who didn't see the movie until years later, to criticize it's philosophy, themes and moral, and say I've alrady seen this... this is nothing special.. \nThis movie is wether u like it or not, groundbreaking in every single way !! The Animation, story, characters and not to mention the very creative awesome futuristic world GITS have created for us !! (the animation then, was unmatched.. nuthin could even compare) \nThis movie have inspired alot of people.. including huuuge artists in the movie business...Quentin Tarantino has even stated that this is the best animated movie EVER.. James Cameron (Avatar), Michael Bay (The Island) and as I said.. The Matrix came out of it.. and that was also a groundbreaking movie which every movie geek to date has either seen or heard of !! And guess what!? The Matrix also inspired other movie makers aswell !! And GITS was part of this !! \nThis is not everyone's cup of tea !! It certainly was not mine, because of the slow pacing in the story and the under developed characters !! I enjoy the series alooot more !! But, if u call urself a movie and anime freak !! This is a MUST SEE !! It is a classic, inspirational and agroundbreaking movie, wether u like it or not !! So pretty plz... don't be one of the ignorant assholes calling this an overrated movie... \n        "},

It is a very good movie, although it leaves a lot of unfinished questions. I only had one problem with the movie. All I could think about through this whole movie was \"Why don't they put any clothes on these chicks?\" I mean,they spend millions of dollars on these cyborgs girls, and yet they dont have enough cash to put a shirt on them. Besides that, it's a pretty good movie, involving a lot of high tech machinery. It seemed a little short, but maybe that's what the second movie is\n          \n        for, I've never watched it. I recommend watching the movie Akira before this one so you can see some of the similiarities, such as the setting of future japan.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="                          \n    Cyborgs in science fiction has been a dime a dozen, either being the major villains or wondering about their existence and their duty and immortality to and comparison to their makers, humans. Just look at the Terminator to Robocop to I, Robot, all have these elements one of the other. Ghost in the Shell does BOTH of these concerning the characters of the Major Motoko Kusunagi and the Puppet Master to some acceptable levels of intrigue.\nBefore LA starts waxxing poetically about the statement above, let's just get the technical features out of the way first, starting with...\nThe animation done by Production IG is an amazingly\n          \n        detailed Niihama City, from it's grungy slums to the more technical sci-fi elements of robots (with some good but PS2-like \"internet-green-wired\" features) added to the mix. The fidelity to the background work really makes the city of Niihama along with the mashup of human society and robotics really makes the city breathe life into itself. The character designs may have been slightly dated in some respects but it still holds up into making the city lively in itself. For the major character designs, Motoko Kusunagi is one of the more distinct character designs to the point of her infamous \"creation\" sequence being a reminder to that. There are other character designs that are memorable just as Batou and Daisuke Aramaki, nonetheless the animation by Production IG is very sharp and detailed to the point it holds up even now as LA wrote this review.\nIn terms of sound, which is a section LA doesn't talk much about in any of LA' s reviews, the music done by Kenji Kawai is soo atmospheric and adds to the animation as well, it may just be heavenly chorus singing along with some percussion added to it adding into the more philosophical talks Motoko talks about more intense aftermaths, but the music is definitely something to be wary of and adds a level of immersion into Ghost in the Shell's fictional world as it were.  \nLet's move to the voice acting, LA looked at both vers. of the voice acting, the Japanese Dub at best is decent at the very best and LA had no qualms to this voice cast, obviously, LA favorite voice actor for the Japanese Dub goes to Maaya Sakamoto as the Major. Switching to the English Dub, LA had a bit more qualms over the Major in this one, LA kinds gets the angle this Dub was trying to go for for the Major in this one and Mimi Woods isn't a terrible voice actor by any stretch of the means, but most of the her lines felt stiff and almost robotic, LA kinda gets \"that was the point\", but in comparison to Maaya Sakamoto's more genuine \"human-cyborg, just doing her duty\" just felt better than saying \"hey, she's a cyborg, we just had to mention that through the Major's inflictions\"....major nitpick for LA, but not the point of annoyance, just something LA wanted to point out. Even with this nitpick, the dub cast was decent as well with Richard Epcar as Batou and William Frederick Knight as Daisuke Aramaki.\nAs for characters, both Motoko Kusunagi and Batou get thier character development mainly through their views on technology and the existentialism they both have as a cyborg or part robot. Minir characters including those in Section 9 do get theur screentime and are supporting characters doing their thing as Ghost in the Shell really focuses on Motoko's chase and capture of the Puppet Master. Saying this, because the minor characters are nothing but support doesn't mean it's a \"horrible\" flaw. Ghost in the Shell just knows what to focus on abd that is on the criminal the Puppet Master. He as a vilian is a unique one as LA said eariler and as much as he brings the \"reaction\" to Motoko, it's his actions that comes into question and by the end of it, the Puppet Master really manifested the core themes of existentialism and technological advances Motoko, Batou and the anime movie itself presented.\nNow onto the plot itself and the start of LA's \"waxxing poetically\", the plot however felt like the least of this anime movie's problems however as the plot felt like a simple plotline of \"finding and apprehending the Puppet Master\" and the Major has some sort of connection to him, LA isn't being harsh, just more or less honest about how the plot structure is like. The philosophical talks of Motoko and Batou has with what being a robot or \"part-robot\" comes along often which afterwards shows some calming backgrounding are littered after each action set piece (in which the battle set pieces are amazingly fluid, detailed and tech-awesome to boot) and although this is character development for them as cyborgs which is completely fine to LA, but it feels as it \"tries\" to connect it to the major plotline of the Puppet Master and it does try but it \"almost\" goes into naval gazing territory but doesn't as the subject matter actually does matter in this regard, it for LA just kinda veers off slightly away from the plot. \nNow it may be that LA is bashing on the plot, but what with the technical features LA vehemently kept praising about along with once the Puppet Master actually comes into focus, is when LA can easily forgive it all because of the connection and the climax of the anime movie it does lead into. Fine, the climax has some shades of anti-climax, but the \"final battle\" and \"ultimate goal the Puppet Master wanted\" somewhat resolved that in some cases, by also giving the Puppet Master a sort of unique motivation for a \"villain\". But here's the thing even if Ghost in the Shell left in a sort of off-note, that's really because Ghost in the Shell doesn't exactly have all the answers and doesn't resolve things for you by the end of it as it allows you the audience to make you think about the resulting climax and ending to it (which is what LA got out of it), even for a futuristic-talking point like \"does cyborgs of A.I have human qualities even if they are nothing but data\" really fuels point further, the movie won't just hand-pick you the answers, it makes you think about our own growing-ever technologically consuming and developing world as to what happens if something like Ghost in the Shell's world might happen to us, where cyborgs and humans co-exist with one another.\nAnd there LA goes waxxing poetically...\n*ahem*, Ghost in the Shell for what a \"simple plot\" it has going for it makes you leave the movie with more questions than answers, even if the animation, music and voice acting is gorgeously detailed in both strands of grunge and technological, atmospheric or decent respectively, Ghost in the Shell does a wonderful job at presenting it's issues but not to the point of pretentiousness and it itself like Motoko and Batou doesn't have all the answers to it all. Flaws and all, LA really did enjoy this movie and can see why this movie is widely regarded as one of the best Japanese animated films to the point of spawning a franchise to further develop Motoko's development.\n        "},
