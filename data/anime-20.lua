    To be honest, Naruto is the most overhyped show in existence. Everyone goes on and on and on about how great it is; and my expectations for this show was equally high. However, I was really, really let down. Really. This wasn't the best show ever, as I had thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, the show is enjoyable, but it's definitely not among the best shows out there. I hope Shippuden will better than this... much better.\
The concept of this show isn't that hard to follow. It's an alternate world in which ninjas live. The ninjas fight by using various skills, and\
          \
        they have this power flowing inside of them called chakra. Chakra is used to perform powerful attacks which (usually) belongs to either of the five traditional elements of earth, fire, water, air and lightning. Of course, since they are ninjas, they fight with weapons like shuriken and kunai as well as hand-to-hand combat. As expected of this kind of world, there's evil people, having different goals and reasons behind their evil.\
The story follows Naruto, one of these ninjas, as he grow as a ninja, from being a stupid little prank-playing brat to becoming a fine ninja. Along the way, he interacts with and makes friends with many fellow ninja, fighting his way towards his dream of becoming Hokage (the leader of his village). \
The story isn't nearly as good as the concept would indicate. Sure, a lot of the characters has some nice background stories, won't complain about that, but they manage to drag out everything so much. It really annoys me. Some fights take several episodes when they could've been done them just as good in one or two. There's also way too much fighting. The story goes like fight, fight, background story, fight, fight, even more fight, half an episode's worth of resting or journeying, fight, fight, and so on. I mean, it's cool to watch fights, but there are just way too many fights, and they drag most of them out to unnecessary lengths. The only really enjoyable fight was the one between Sasuke and Naruto right before the fillers began. Which brings up another thing...\
Fillers! Agh, I normally don't mind fillers, but Naruto had some really, really stupid ones. Sure, there was the occasional diamond among the charcoal, but that doesn't excuse the high amount of bad fillers. I mean, just because they are fillers doesn't mean that they have to make them bad. Several shows have actually made decent and at the same time long fillers (especially Bleach, with its 40-episode long Bount arc), but Naruto failed horribly here. \
Also, I feel that Naruto is very silly at times. Silly is usually good, but not when it's immature silly. And guess what+ Naruto is silly in an immature way. It's so dreadfully stupid at times that I had to close my eyes, take a deep breath and wait until it got serious again. Now, it did have some good comical moments, but those were far and wide between.\
Another thing I feel like releasing my rage on is the animation. It barely manages to get the description &ldquo;average&rdquo; to me. At its best, it's slightly above average. However, a lot of time it's slipshod galore with the animation. I still have many very bad memories from having to watch lots of errors in the animation, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get rid of those memories. While the amount of errors decreased as the episodes passed by, at least every second episode before the 100s had one or more moments of slipshod animation. Wonder if they ever considered firing the animators.\
As a side mention, they should do something about Rock Lee - even though I've slightly gotten used to his horrible looks, I still feel a burn in the back of my eye every time I see him.\
The music is pretty good, though. A lot of great tunes (especially the sad ones are great), and the first few OPs and EDs were pretty awesome. It has some really bad music parts too, like the tribal voice-ish song, and sometimes they could've used better themes during the fights. As the series progressed, the quality of the OPs and EDs decrease too.\
The characters are fairly okay, I guess. Some of them are really annoying, like Naruto, because he's so stupid. Agh, he annoys me to no end! Some other characters are annoying too, because of things like their looks (Gai and Lee), or because they are failed attempts at comical relief (at least in my eyes, you might find them funny), like the all too perverted Jiraiya.\
That's the negative about them. However, they have some really nice background stories, some which are elaborated more upon than others. Many of the characters also get fair amounts of screen time, which for some people can seem too much, whilst others will be content with it, because their favorite character from the show gets an episode for him/herself. \
I also like the fact that most of them have dreams or aspirations, and motives for what they are doing and how they are acting (usually it's tied together with their background stories). The growing relationships between them is also nice, their maturing, and how Naruto is slowly getting accepted by more and more people through hard work. \
Basically, they've portrayed the characters very well, and not too over the top, but some of them act stupid and silly from time to time, which drags the character rating down.\
I have some mixed feelings for the show, which kind of drags down on the enjoyability factor of it. Great concept, not as good story, both good and bad music, horrid animation at times, many characters with background stories, some of them great and some not-so-great; it's hard to completely make up my mind, but I believe the ratings I have given shows my feelings towards the different aspects of the show.\
Of course, even though there was things I didn't like, I can easily see why this show is so popular as it is; it has humor that the kids may find funny, as well as  lots of fights which appeal to the teenagers and adults. I personally didn't like it that much, though. I'm looking forward to Shippuden, because I&rsquo;ve heard it was much better&hellip; I really hope so!\

    I began to browse through the reviews of Naruto, and realized something was horribly wrong. All the experienced anime watchers were giving it crappy reviews, and all the first-timers were giving it rave reviews, with reasons that every anime has to back them up. How could this be? Gee, I wonder. For some strange reason, Naruto has become the most popular and well-known anime series ever, and as such, it is usually the first anime seen by anime watchers alike. Why this is, I don't know. Maybe it appeals to a wide variety of young teenagers...\
When I was 13 years old, I remember watching and\
          \
        loving this anime. I had never seen any other anime shows, and I thought the concept was original and amazing. When I found out that others animes literally had all that Naruto had plus a lot more, I was... bored with all the fillers. At the time the anime was great, but it really does get old.\
Then again, the anime is not absolutely horrible. It has the essentials, with a somewhat unique story and art style. The characters are cliche, and enjoyment is there but short and sweet.\
What I truly love about Naruto is the great soundtrack. It seems that all the OP and ED are just fabulous, and the music just fits within the series. I would have liked a bit of a change over the course of the show, but hey, it almost never happens.\
All in all, it was a good show. Just good. So basically: Shame on those people who watch 10 episodes and immediately come here and write a review. Also shame on people who give this show all 1's because everyone else loves it. It's OK, but ive definitely seen better.\

    I'm sure most, if not all, the people who end up reading this review have seen Naruto before and those who haven't are probably put off by the pure unadulterated hatred this and the more recent Shippuuden garner. Okay, I guess \"unadulterated\" is a strong word but I digress..\
In any case, before starting this review I want to point out that I haven't read the manga so I'm unsure as to what was or wasn't changed during the process of animating this story and I guess it's time to get the show on the road. \
*Also, let it be known that the infamous \"Filler Arc\"\
          \
        is not part of this review.\
Naruto is the story of a group of rookie ninja from Konoha (Leaf) Village, with particular focus on our title character Naruto Uzumaki and his two friends Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha. The story starts soon after the three of them graduate from there Ninja Academy and are put under the care of Kakashi Hatake who, for the most part, takes on the standard role of the \"mentor\" who teaches them the value of teamwork and all that jazz.\
The main characters can apparently be hit or miss, though I liked them for the most part. Naruto himself seems to follow in the footsteps of Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise, though I personally don't consider him anywhere near as dense and also don't consider him an \"idiot\" like most people tend to.\
Sakura seems to get the most flack from my experience because, for the most part she plays the \"useless female\" role. The thing is, she herself realizes that and actively tries to change herself which makes for some interesting scenes down the road. \
Sasuke is probably the most intriguing of the main characters, simply because he himself admits that he is only training to \"kill a certain man\" and he and Naruto clash quite a few times over their belief systems, particularly in the oh so excellent final arc.\
As far as Kakashi, there isn't a whole lot to say as he reveals very few nuggets of information about himself. He's a cool guy, but he's very much a supporting character during this series.\
But, to be honest, the thing that Naruto can be proud of is the excellent cast of supporting characters. From the intelligent, yet lethargic Shikamaru to the Bruce Lee wanna be Rock Lee it's pretty cool to see all these different characters, who usually have a very interesting and unique fighting style, clash with one another. \
It also should be mentioned that a certain villain, Orochimaru, who appears rather frequently is a scene stealer and takes part in some of the more memorable moments of this series. It's also when he appears that the show really takes off and gets interesting, as he is the instigator of some of the biggest plot points. His personality and his willingness to use any and all means to further himself and his power is interesting and very often disturbing.\
One thing that is important throughout the series is the running theme of revenge and human relations. Every one, from Gaara to Sasuke to Naruto himself has had some sort of bad experience during their childhood and it seems as though \"friendship overcoming tragedy\" is maybe the predominate theme throughout the show.  \
Now this series being a shounen, it's obvious it has pacing flaws here and there. For example, many of the fight scenes are dragged out to an annoying degree. And this is very apparent in the first arc when the characters go through two separate fight scenes that both take at the very least three or four episodes each, which isn't a huge problem if you marathon the series like I did. But, it still deserves  mentioning as it is annoying.\
The plus side is that most fight scenes, particularly during the Chuunin Exam arc and beyond, are very well animated and just overall well done. The aforementioned Shikamaru for example has some of the more noteworthy scenes because he uses his head, instead of any physical abilities, and his fight scenes are always damn good fun.\
But, this also highlights one of the issues I do have with the fight scenes and, even though this is a problem with shounen action anime in general, it's especially bothersome here. The characters have a habit of explaining everything they do to their enemy which would be time better spent actually defeating your opponent rather than telling them your skills. I know it's just so the mangaka can flex his thought process and the logic behind the attacks to the viewer but..it's still kind of tiresome and could certainly be implemented better.\
I think the music bears mentioning as I thought it was either great, such as most of the music used during the dramatic scenes and some battle scenes, or forgettable, which is pretty much the rest of the fight scene music. \
The Japanese voice actors did a great job imo, especially during some of the more serious scenes. But, I especially got to shout out to the multiple voices for Orochimaru. Of which almost all of them are suitably creepy and, even though they sound different, they still manage to pull off the basic speech patterns. \
In Summary:\
Story: 7\
It takes a while for things to really get going, but once it does you'll notice it. Unfortunately for some, the pacing can sometimes be broken by the short training arcs which are actually pretty entertaining and in many cases are segued in nicely with the story arcs. Also, there is only one short filler arc throughout the first 135 episodes.\
Art: 8\
First off, it should be apparent from our protagonists conspicuous appearance that, in many ways these guys are ninjas in name only. Still, the appearances of the characters throughout the series are so varied that I, at the very least, didn't care. Animation does take a dip occasionally, however.\
Sound: 8\
Orochimaru is a plus, no doubt about that. And most of the other cast members have good voice acting, though Rock Lee's can sometimes be grating.. The music is pretty good, though occasionally generic.\
Character: 8\
Depending on how you take to Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura this could be your favorite part of the series, which is the case for me, or your least favorite, and probably game breaking, aspect of the series as it does depend upon these three for the vast majority of the story . But, I'm sure most people will like the supporting characters as almost all of them are developed to a satisfying degree. Unfortunately, all of them fit the tragic past stereotype so...your mileage may vary. You may want to avoid this series if you aren't a fan of melodrama.\
Enjoyment: 9\
Hell yeah, I enjoyed this series. I won't lie, I loved this series. But, it certainly isn't for everyone and I can understand quite a few people being frustrated by this shows some times slow, often times fast pacing and some of the more dragged out arcs even frustrated me at times. Also, as I said before, enjoyment largely hinges on whether or not you take to the three main characters or not. \
Overall: 8\
 To sum it up, don't go into Naruto expecting to see the tightest script ever written or anything thought provoking. Just go into it for a fun time and, maybe, you'll be surprised by the well developed characters like I was. Make no mistake, Naruto was a great experience for me..especially because I went into the series expecting it to be terrible and, by the time I realized it wasn't, I was enjoying the ride. \
*If you want to make any sort of comment, just drop by my profile. Criticism is welcome as this is my first review in quite a while and I went with a different style than I have in the past. Thanks for reading this review, I hope it helps anyone interested in this series.\

    Naruto, yes Naruto. One of the series that has defined the cultural shonen’s of the last generation in the history of anime. This is a series that has changed significantly over the past decade.\
What I love bout naruto  is the whole “Ninja aspect” of the show. Every technique had substance, quality and all of the training arcs really shown the defining elements of how ninjutsu worked within the naruto universe. These qualities are something I will soon not forget. I know alot of people complain about naruto being a half ass wit that can’t do nothing Or perhaps sakura being useless. But in away\
          \
        I look at the series as being a little different, especially in the developing of characters.\
Kishimoto did not intend to create the story with a “bad ass” character right from the start, toppling villains one after the other, no. Naruto was set up in a way that much resembles an ordinary life and the tribulations and tests you must go through. Death is at every corner and naruto is a kid that is trying to fit in with the rest of the shinobi and be \"recognized\" I think that was one of the main defining elements of the original series. Kishi wanted to show here is a character that no one likes because he has a living breathing monster inside of him. You can only wonder what he is thinking, being in his predicament.\
Watching him grow up as a monster and trying to be known as a famous shinobi and protect his friends, but realizing that he is in a world fraught with danger at every corner. Watching his friends die before him or getting hurt. The degree of emotion in the series was something I really enjoyed. It was really powerful. I remember hearing people spout nonsense in the discussions boards \"omg to much drama, get on with the fighting already\" But I actually liked how naruto had that drama, it fit in with the entire theme of the series. It kind of brings a whole different realism to the show compared to other shonen series. I won’t state any names.\
One of the things that kishi really focused on in the original was friendship, and bonds. Thats one of the major theme's watching this team 7 grow up together, learning from kakashi and becoming great ninja in the process, learning the ways of the ninja world. This show explores themes of revenge, hate, bonds and sorrow to a very astounding degree.\
\
  The characters in this series were in every sense of the word children, growing up in a world full of adults that were much more talented ninja's both skills and combat. That is not to say the show was made for children. Just that kishi wanted to show the younger generation as the main characters of the show and the older generation as the training shinobi. They had to learn the ropes of what being a ninja is like. After their pre training sessions, they were finally put to the test of just how grueling the world is and how they must use every ounce of there being to survive and also protect the people they love.\
\
10 years ago people viewed naruto very different to how people view it today.\
Perhaps maybe the reason I love naruto so much and the reason it feels very nostalgic to me, is because I was around when I watched it first aired and I remember the fanbase during that time of the original series. It was one of THEE most popular anime series on the net and not a single person had anything remotely unscrupulous to say about it. Suddenly after the 100 episode filler arc, or the not so appreciated “shipuuden” it lost its reputation and became a show just muddled by idiots that call any one narutards for watching it. I have seen how the fanbase has changed significantly over the past 10 years of watching naruto. It is quite sad really.\
I still consider naruto to be one of my favorite quality anime series, regardless of where it’s going. Perhaps maybe its because im very infatuated with ninja's and like the unique way that kishi has created this ninja world. Similar to how i really love pirates in the one piece world. Every arc is something new and fresh so kishi can develop on that and expand upon the show in various different ways.  One piece had some of the greatest character back stories and cast I’ve seen in a series, but it did suffer from story progression a bit thankfully naruto does not. It has a pretty solid pace and some of the most ground breaking plot twists.\

I guess it’s all a matter of personal preference and what you like to see in a show. I my self im not a huge fan of typical shonene tropes that are used consistently, but i love how the original series gave us a much more powerful emotional impact to the show. In away it felt more humanized as apposed to the more generic super power elements of shipuuden.\

    \9I would like to start this review off by saying that I did not grow up with the Naruto series, nor did I have any pre-judgment of the series before I started watching it. Therefore I’d like to assert that my perspective on this series is as unbiased as it’s probably going to get, considering its popularity. When watching the series, the first thing I did was compile a list of filler episodes, and then promptly skipped all of them. This is so my watching experience in terms of the story deviated from the manga source material as little as possible. That being said, here\
          \
        is a breakdown of the score I gave the Naruto anime as well as reasons behind each scoring. As I typically do when reviewing anything, I will start off with the positives and end on the negatives.\
Sound: 7/10\
The sound in Naruto is definitely above average, and certainly immerses you in the scenes at hand. That being said, while the sound is a step above average, it isn’t top tier quality, so I feel as if a seven out of ten is properly justified. No need to really go into much detail here. \
Art: 6/10\
I found the art in this series to be pleasing to the eye; there weren’t any moe blobs, characters that looked like they could sooner pass for aliens rather than human beings, and it lacked a “childish” sort of look to it. That being said, there wasn’t anything here that was spectacular. Considering it was produced from 2002-2007, there were series with much better art than this even before that time.  This is the justification behind me giving it the 6/10 that I think it deserves, which in my mind is just about average. \
Story: 3/10\
This is where, for me, the Naruto series started failing. Anything mentioned here will be re-iterated in the very first episode of the series, so I’m assuming that this won’t be considered “spoilers” per say. Naruto is based off an infant child who is infused with the spiritual energy of a nine-tailed demon in order to prevent a disaster from befalling his village. He is now viewed as an outcast and a monster throughout his childhood because of these events, rather than a scapegoat for saving the entirety of his village. Now Naruto’s aim is to change this reputation, and gain the respect of his village by becoming the most powerful person in it. You might be thinking to yourself at this point, “Wow, that story isn’t bad at all, why are you giving this a 3/10?!”… Well, I will now explain my rating of this as concisely as possible. The issue here is that the story doesn’t evolve at all during the span of the 131 episodes that aren’t comprised of filler material. Naruto begins to be accepted by his peers early on, and the whole idea of him being viewed as a “monster” diminishes quickly. When that happens, Naruto wants to become the strongest just for the sake of being the strongest. This sets the stage for the story to carry out like practically every other shounen in existence, and what was once a unique story with a high potential for excellence loses said potency very fast.  I see no reason why to consider this story anything even close to mediocrity, hence the three out of ten rating you see here. \
Characters: 2/10\
This is where I’ve seen other people say the series suffers the most, and after watching it, I’d have to agree with them. The phrase “one dimensional characters” gets thrown around a lot, and while I might have a different idea than some about the interpretation of this phrase, I agree with it. The thing with the Naruto anime is that the author only knows how to write one type of character type well, and that is the character that involves some kind of tragic loss in their life. I guess you could simplify what I just wrote and say “the only character the author knows how to write is Naruto” and get away with it just fine. Literally every character in the plot that is riddled with some sort of tragedy happens to have the same tragedy; someone they cared about has died in the past, and it has left them broken, mentally damaged or downright evil as a result. Don’t expect any sort character depth beyond this. The villains? They’re mostly evil just for the sake of being evil, or for the other aforementioned reason. They have that cliché plot convenience of “I’m not the true mastermind behind all the said evil events you have been fighting against, merely a puppet of some greater evil!” sort of deal, and spoiler alert, it doesn’t get old as the show progresses. That’s just the beginning of why I consider this anime to have one of the worst characterizations I have ever seen. \
Moving on to something else; romance. In my opinion, a romance should either be included and done properly, or given the setting, not included at all. With Naruto, I’m leaning more towards “not included at all”. Think of it this way, the characters are roughly the age of your average elementary school student. When you were about 11 years of age, were you concerned about having a girlfriend? I sure as hell wasn’t, I was more concerned about finishing my collection of Zelda games and beating my friends in Super Smash Bros. Yet romance plays a part of the primary characterization of some of the main characters, despite their age, and it really isn’t done well. You won’t see any sort of romantic development throughout the entirety of this anime, and given that a certain character’s (that shall not be named) “character” depends almost entirely on this aspect, it makes for a very poor attempt at convincing the viewer that they have any sort of significance in the plot. For these reasons, I give the characters a 2/10, being one of the worst attempts at characterization I have seen in modern anime. \
Enjoyment: 2/10\
As a result of the other scores that you see above, this is what I came up with as a score. Given that I get most of my enjoyment from characterization and story, this score seems fairly natural to hand out.\
Overall: 4/10\
This is just an average of the scores you see above. This show is scoring consistently above 7/10 in reviews, and I see no merits behind why it should be, given what I have discussed above. I would conclude that with this score Naruto has too many flaws to make it a passable watching experience.",

    I've heard a lot of people call this the most overrated anime of all time.\
So is it really?\
Well, that depends on who you ask. Me? I'm one of the guys who loves it. This is the anime that got me into anime in the first place. So why should you read my review as opposed to the hundred others? Because I'll try to show you both what everyone gripes about and what they love about the show. Bear with me on this review, as it will be a little long, but since the anime I'm reviewing is pretty long, I have a lot to cover.\
Story\
          \
        (10/10) - Ok, a lot of people gripe about the story of Naruto, saying it's cliche, moves too slowly, isn't interesting, or whatever. I have to admit, some of these complaints are well-founded. So why did I give it a 10/10? Because the story is so complex and well-done. A lot of this won't become obvious until Naruto: Shippudden, but this is a review of the original series, so, I digress.\
Naruto is set in a fictional universe where Shinobi (Ninja) are basically the entire cast. Most Shinobi aren't mercenaries, but instead, fight to protect their village, and complete missions to earn money for it. The main character is one such Shinobi, name \"Naruto\" (hence, the name of the series). Naruto is a rebellious, disrespectful, punk, yet he still wants to become a great ninja. He even aspires to become \"Hokage\" (the lead ninja of his village). While this may sound pretty cliche, you'll quickly realize that Naruto has a long way to go before he has any hope of becoming Hokage.\
This series goes through a lot of twists and turns. The story is too complicated to try to explain in this review, but the further along you go, you'll find that Naruto aspirations aren't easy to live up to. In the very first arc, Naruto and his companions are confronted by a powerful Shinobi who wants to kill the man they have been assigned to protect. The battle that ensued is what got me hooked on this show.\
The fights in general are nothing short of brilliant. If you like action, this anime is for you! The battles will have you on the edge of your seat, and you won't be able to stop until you see how the fight is concluded. I also enjoy watching the characters learn new moves and apply them in combat situations. You'll see Naruto change from an annoying little punk, to a ninja who people actually start to respect for his perseverance and strength.\
Now, for the things people gripe about in this show. Oftentimes, a fight scene will be interrupted by a flashback or monologue, and this can get dull at times. I didn't mind so much the first time around, but it does hurt the rewatch value a bit. The story can move slowly at times, but most of the slowness is because of how complex the story truly is. The further you go, the deeper you'll see things get.\
Another thing people gripe about is the length. While it's true that 220 episodes is quite an undertaking, it's really not necessary to watch more than the first 135 episodes. Yes, you heard me correctly friends. The last 85 episodes of the show are nothing but a desolate wasteland, inhabited by nothing but the pile of vomit known as \"filler\". I only watched the first 40 episodes of filler before I'd had enough, and skipped on to Shippudden. Some of the filler arcs are truly terrible. You'll sit back and wonder how the creators of the show had the audacity to slap the name \"Naruto\" to the garbage you've been viewing (if you're brave enough to bother watching it). Hence, my review only covers the non-filler portions of the show. Do yourself a favor and skip the filler. It really isn't worth your time.\
Art (7/10) - Here the show isn't as strong. While the art is never distinctly poor, it's also not great either. I suppose at times it can't be helped when making a series as long as this one. The animation is often stepped up for fights, or more intense parts of the show, which does help considerably. The art is at least passable, and I was never really bothered by it. Definitely not a show you watch for the eye-popping scenery, though.\
Sound (7/10) - I must say that I really did enjoy the music at first. While it tended to use synthesizers a bit more than I cared for, it still distinctly fit the mood of the show. Some of the battle music was catchy, and managed to combine electric guitar with more traditional sounding string or wind instruments. However, the creators of the show didn't seem to think it was necessary to update their musical score once in awhile. This wouldn't have been a problem if the show wasn't 220 episodes long. Music that I had once enjoyed, began to grow a bit overused by the end of the series. It never grew to the point of bothering me, but had the show gone on much longer before the filler started, I might have thought differently. The music is good, just used for a few too many episodes.\
The voice acting was easily good enough for me as well. Not outstanding, but never distinctly bad either. Just don't watch the dubbed version. Naruto's voice alone will be enough to drive you insane. \
Character (9/10) - Getting to know the cast can be a bit daunting at first. I've never taken the time to count, but there must be at least 30+ characters who get a decent amount of screen time in this show. While this sounds very cumbersome, it actually helps the show quite a bit. each character has their own unique back story and their own battle techniques. While one might think that ninja from a particular village all use the same techniques, this couldn't be further from the truth. The styles of combat are so diverse, that it makes for some VERY interesting fight sequences. Sometimes one character is at a distinct disadvantage, and is forced to out think his opponent in order to win. If it weren't for the brilliantly done fights and interesting characters, this show would lose a lot of it's value.\
There is one drawback to all of these characters, though. Sometimes, a somewhat minor character will have a flashback in the middle of a fight. It does help to have some context for why they fight, but it gets old at times, especially if it's a minor character that no one really cares about. Despite this problem, the show does a good job of somehow making you hate a character in the beginning, and totally changing your opinion of them at one point or another. I can think of several examples of this.\
Another problem is that some of the main characters (aka Naruto) are kind of annoying. Naruto is honestly a complete moron in the beginning, and you probably won't like him much at first. He gets better as things go along, but you'll still cringe at him a few times early on. Another annoying character is the lead female: Sakura. Sakura spends the entire series being obsessed with Sasuke (the third member of Naruto and Sakura's three-man team) and never really does anything worthwhile. She spends her time sitting on the sidelines of fights and cheering for Naruto and Sasuke (she gets better in Shippudden, but once again, this isn't a Shippudden review). While this didn't bother me at first, it got kind of annoying when all Sakura could do for the entire series was yell \"Sasuke, Sasuke!\" But anyway, moving right along. Their sensei,  Kakashi, is very calm and cool, and helps to balance out this team of knuckleheads. Naruto's an idiot, Sakura's useless, and Sasuke's a child prodigy, yet somehow, Kakashi turns them into a functional ninja team. An impressive feat, if you ask me.\
To sum it up, whatever shortcomings these characters have, you'll still find yourself rooting for them as they are put through fight after fight, trying to protect their village, the people they love, and what they believe in. For every character that annoys you, there will be at least one that you genuinely love. Even though I did a lot of complaining about the three central characters, I still found myself rather attached to them by the end of the series. The characters will do a good job of making you laugh throughout the series, and it helps to lighten the mood when you sometimes least expect it.\
As you can see based on the 9/10 I gave the characters, I definitely grew to like them. Despite all the complaints people have, the characters are still very well done.\
Enjoyment (10/10) - It's hard to be objective on this part of the review. I enjoyed it tremendously, but there are plenty of people who don't. I'd say give it a chance and see what you think. You'll probably know whether or not you'll like the show after the first arc is finished, which is about 17 episodes.\
Overall (10/10)- Were we on a slightly more precise scale, I might give it a 9.5. I've already said that I enjoyed it a lot, but let me try to sum things up for you:\
Pros: Lots of action! There are a lot of very well-done fights, which is one of the strongest points of the show. The characters are a good bit better than average, with a few annoying exceptions. The story is long, and complex, but very good.\
Cons: It's a long anime. 135 episodes (non-filler) for just the original series is a sizable undertaking. Some of the main characters are a bit on the annoying side, and it takes a few episodes before they grow up a little. The long filler arc at the end also turns people off, especially those who feel compelled to watch an entire anime without skipping the filler. \
Hopefully this helps!\
Thanks for reading! Feedback appreciated.\

    ok so I've seen like 200+ series and i have to say that this is one pathetic series. i watched up to shippuden 50. im telling you nothing interesting happens, and like 90% of the series is filler anyway. \
the plot is seriously lacking and its a pathetic excuse for a slice of life/action-drama type of show. im writing this for people who legitimately haven't seen the show and i know im going to get flamed by a whole bunch of narutards but the series is just NOT worth the acclaim or watching at all. \
the characters are even worse. you have your over-zealous,untalented guy\
          \
        who thinks he can do anything if he tries hard enough. . .and he just so happens to get increasingly stronger enemies to fight along the way. than you have your emo broody guy who all the fan girls swoon over while he talks about how much he resents his brother and must AVENGE HIS CLAN! get over it already and last you have your naturally talented good girl who has a crush on the bad boy, even though its obvious he hates her and that the other guy would kill to have her. look people this has been done MILLIONS! of times before so please if you haven't seen the series don't watch it. it will waste days of your life away for nothing. . .literally the series will take up 88 hours of your life! thats over 3 and a half DAYS! you could have been doing something WAY more productive. hell, it doesn't even have to be productive. you could probably have a better time watching paint dry! listen to me people, for gods sake i only watched as far as i did out of obligation to finish a series i started but it wasn't worth it! so PLEASE heed my words and never ever watch this series of overrated garbage!\
by the way, this is for all the narutards. . .flame this review all you want but you know im telling the truth, so when you develop a taste for better anime come talk to me...\
P.S- all you people who post recommendations for anime. . .if its naruto, YOU DON'T NEED TO REQUEST BLEACH , ONE PIECE , OR  DEATH NOTE! people know already and the chances are if they have bad enough taste to watch or enjoy naruto THEY'VE PROBABLY SEEN THE OTHERS ANYWAY! (no offense to the shows mentioned in the last sentence, i like bleach... to an extent, and death note was pretty good too)...fuck one piece... XD\

    Proof that I will watch just about anything, or rather that I once had nothing better to do than watch this crap while waiting for Squidbillies to come on (Unknown Hinson fangirl).\
In either case, there are few anime out there that evoke a visceral reaction like Naruto. Sure there is Inuyasha and you can get your eyes clawed out by yaoi fangirls for calling them closet lesbians, but no other anime has started a craze of shut ins wearing orange sweatsuits and headbands to school like Naruto. \
See, a uniform code is not just for keeping Crips and Bloods from wearing gang colors to school.\
Naruto\
          \
        is about a Ninja named Eddie. No, he's named Naruto. He lives in a village where some great Ninja master gave his life to entrap an alien parasite into a carrier queen, I mean a Demon Fox into a baby's body. That baby is Naruto, a completely useless ninja who can summon the great power of the fox within. Think of him like a impish Goku, or maybe Ichigo--I don't know. Anime that go on forever all blend in for me.\
What is this all about, well it's the typical drawn out storyboard of characters growing up and becoming ninja. Doing Ninja missions (which are filler episodes) while the story dances around the plot that Sasuke is some talented Ninja with a traitor dick of a brother, some girl called Sakura, some short quiet Rei-clone of a girl whose name escapes me but I keep running into on gelbooru, and a sensei who loves kancho--but in the English dub the delightful Japanese pasttime of poking someone's asshole in a nonsexual way with your index finger is clearly unacceptable and heavily edited.\
Honestly there is no plot. Naruto is a loser, but he has a great power and a lot of the show is geared around how he takes a beating but when he unleashes that power, it is maximum. There's some effeminate snake ninja who plots to get revenge on the leaf village, molests Sasuke, gets pwnt only to return over and over again, there's Sakura being split whether to spread her legs for Sasuke or Naruto--but settling for some old woman instead.\
This is your typical cliffhanger anime where you watch someone power up or prepare to unleash an ultimate technique for 20 minutes, then are forced to watch a filler episode before you see the obvious, with plot twists usually being mundane like \"the ninja training exam has been hijacked, oh noes!\" With that said, you'd think with over 200 episodes they could develop the characters, but strangely these kind of anime seem to be unable to do that--instead of relying on stock characters that don't really change over time (well, they can become more moody, evil, or slutty--but that isn't a dramatic and shattering change).\
I just have to concede that I don't understand this. And I also have to concede that I don't like this. Good drama and fiction doesn't spread itself so thin, becoming hopelessly lost in itself.\
Also, for the love of God, don't dress up as Naruto.\
Just don't.\

    Having watched many different series of anime, I can understand why the 'elitest' out there give this series a bad review; however, I can also say they're flat out wrong and biased. Naruto is a fantastic anime that doesn't get due credit where it's deserved.\
First off, it's true that the fillers of this anime that take up about the last 1/3 of this Part 1 are flat out terrible. With the exception of the first two arcs (including the amazing Bikouchi retrieval arc) they're probably the worst anime I've ever seen and the fillers in Naruto Shippuden are just as bad. But I think as\
          \
        anime watchers, we should recognize fillers when we see them and simply ignore them.\
The anime itself is well-done with some of the most memorable tunes you will ever hear. I currently have one of the everyday tunes as my cellphone jingle - it's that catchy. The plot is original and fun, which is why Naruto has taken off to such enormous heights. The characters are all amazing and it's common knowledge that Kakashi and Itachi are two of the most bad-ass characters of all time in any anime. Everyone can find a character to relate to. From the lovable Rock Lee and Hinata to the inpalpable Gaara and Sasuke, we all find something to cheer for or hold onto in this anime, making it addicting.\
 Those who give this anime a bad review refuse to acknowledge the points that make this one of the greatest and most popular anime of all time. It's their loss. Yu-Gi-Oh was the same way. You accept it or you don't, but if you don't like it, most people will disagree with you, which makes you wrong by consensus.\
Try the first 15 episodes and give it an honest try. By the time the Kakashi/Zabuza fight rolls around, you might just get hooked. Don't say I didn't warn you.\

    Naruto is a hit or miss show. You love it, or you hate it. I mean, how many times have you heard from Narutards calling it 'the best anime ever'? How many times have you heard from Naruto haters calling it 'the worst anime ever'? Both have ruined the Naruto fan base, so now no one pays attention to Naruto anymore. I hope this review will get at least one person to try Naruto, even if it turns out they don't like it.\
The story is basically about the main protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki, and his journey on becoming the greatest ninja in the Hidden Leaf Village.\
          \
        No one believes that Naruto can do this, seeing how this is because Naruto is a hooligan due to the loss of his parents at a young age, and how no one is friends with him because Naruto has a kyuubi, or demon fox, sealed inside of him that attacked the Hidden Leaf Village. Naruto isn't officially a ninja yet, so he takes the ninja test. He fails the test by his teacher, Iruka. Later, the other teacher in charge of the Ninja Academy, Mizuki, tells Naruto he can pass the test if he can get the ninja scroll, which is actually a scroll with every ninja jutsu known to man. Mizuki is actually taking the advantage of Naruto to take the scroll and destroy the Hidden Leaf Village. Iruka hears about this, and challenges Mizuki in combat, but is unable to win. Naruto then challenges Mizuki to combat after Iruka loses, even though Mizuki has the advantage, Naruto defeats Mizuki because he studied a technique in the scroll. Naruto is now able to not only clone himself with the jutsu, but able to clone about 100 of himself. Iruka then passes Naruto as a ninja, and is put in squads with Sakura Haruno, Sasuke Uchiha, and Kakashi Hatake, the team leader who is the second closest ninja in the whole series. After Naruto is put in squads, the series moves on to arcs, the Zabuza arc, the Chunin Exam arc (which basically every character in the Naruto series is introduced), the Orochimaru arc, the Jiraiya arc, and the Tsunade arc. All those arcs last up to episode 100. Even though Naruto has a basic story, each episode has it's own story to it, making each episode unique in it's own way. I therefore like Naruto's story because of this, which makes episode to episode enjoyable.\
The art from Naruto isn't superb, but this probably because the anime was made in 2002. But this is an excuse, because the anime Fruits Basket was made a year before Naruto, and had superb art. The art looks basic, like One Piece and Bleach's art style. Naruto is a ninja anime, but if you couldn't tell already, none of the characters in Naruto look like ninjas. I mean, orange jumpsuits? Have you ever seen a ninja in an orange jumpsuit? Basically none of the characters wear black and cover their face with a mask, except for Kakashi, but that's his personal preference, not because the creator wanted one character to look like a ninja. Even though the art improved throughout the series, the animation still had plainness to it, so therefore I can't give the animation a great score.\
The soundtrack that waws in Naruto was pretty good, and it fits in parts where it needed to be. A lot of people don't really enjoy the soundtrack, but I think the composers did a great job on the upbeat themes for combat and sad music for dramatic moments. And the voice acting was good for each character in both dubbed and subbed versions. Naruto has an arrogant whiny voice, Sakura has a self-sufficient bitchy voice, Sasuke has an assholish angry voice, and Kakashi has a leader-type of voice. I would go more on to voice acting of other characters, but there are too many characters to list.\
Now on to the characters. There are a lot of good characters in Naruto, but some characters ruin great parts of the show. Naruto is a great main protagonist, who won't stop until he gets what he wants. Kakashi is a great leader, and always puts others before himself. Both Hinata and Neji Hyuuga are great characters for being strongly developed with the story line and courageous, and Tenten for being the closest of a ninja in the anime. Now some of the characters I don't really like. Sakura is bitchy and whiny, all she does is 'ADORE' Sasuke, and is a useless ninja. Ino Yamanaka, because she is the most useless character in almost any anime, and Shikamaru Nara, for being boring. Therefore the characters I didn't like didn't necessarily ruin the series, but it sure didn't improve it.\
I'm just going to say it, Naruto is one of my favorite animes, and almost my favorite anime series. Even though I didn't give everything a perfect score, there is one thing I can give a 10- enjoyment. I enjoyed almost every single bit of Naruto, all the way to episode 220. Naruto might not be perfect, but to me it was perfect enjoyment.\

    Naruto, a lot of the new generations first favorite anime. It was not my first, I am with the last gen with Sailor Moon, DBZ and others. Naruto I started watching around... when it first came out. It was the first of it's kind, it lost spunk near the end, but it really kept you going for the first 135 episodes.\
Story:\
It was different then most animes, people don't admit it, but it was. It wasn't always about Naruto though, which sometimes made me wonder why Kishimoto called it Naruto. The story follows mainly Team 7 (Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura) and the journeys they have until\
          \
        Sasuke starts to split, then it is about getting Sasuke back. The story is good, but reminds me of DBZ at times; too much talking, so the story takes a bit to be told. Despite that fact, the story still kept me interested until Sasuke finally left and then fillers. Those turned me off a bit, but I still finished it. (By the way, Shippuuden [Naruto part 2] is all about getting Sasuke back, if you didn't like that story, then don't bother watching Naruto Shippuuden)\
Art:\
A bit plan, but I liked how all the characters looked different. They all had different styles and designs to them. Rock Lee looked different from Orochimaru. Each character had distinct personalites to, but I'll get to that. The backgrounds were okay, but some looked great, like the Valley of The End where Naruto and Sasuke fought. I thought that was very interesting and symbolic.\
Sound:\
If you think of ninja music what do you think of? The music from Naruto. I think they really matched everything when it came to sound. The sound and music were the best bits from this show. Who ever this composer is, he made something out of himself because the show's music was much to its success as well as everything else.\
Characters:\
They are all different, I love that. Rock Lee has bushy eye brows, very positive and has simple eyes while Choji is huge, simple minded, and easily angered. Each character is different and that makes Naruto stand out to me. Some characters I didn't like, but every show has that. Naruto's character changes a lot and that bothered me through out this series, but overall, I still loved the characters.\
Overall:\
I loved this series, if you are going to watch it, watch until at least episode 135 and then, if you want, head to Shippuuden. I don't like Shippuuden very much, but if you gave Naruto all ten's, I highly recommend it.\

    Naruto is the typical Shounen anime. Despite the success of its manga counterpart, the anime tries to take advantage of that advantage and attempts to drag out the series for all it's worth; and as far as quality is concerned, it is worth nothing.\
Story: \
Naruto's plot is driven by noneother than the 'prototype' shounen anime template. Loner protagonist has bad past, then proceeds to set a goal in his life, along the way he meets other characters which make his possy even stronger. However, Naruto manages to make such a dull plot into an even more bland anime. By disrupting the plot with unneeded comedy/fanservice,\
          \
        the pacing suffers a huge blow.\
Art:\
The art of Naruto is truly non-existent, given the funding they were provided with. The combat scenes are a repitition of a the same action sequence. The background can be easily distinguished as rushed through (perhaps because their need to pump out 220 episodes).\
Sound:\
The BGM/SFX is typical hot-blooded, weapon smashing, so there is nothing to praise there. \
The voice acting is moderately done: the seiyuus bring out their cliched characters to life.\
Character:\
Naruto: Arrogant, hot-blooded, typical protagonist (Read: Ichigo, Bleach)\
Sasuke: Suave, cold, typical foil character (Read: Zoro, One Piece)\
Sakura: Typical tsundere, has crush on both(Read: ...)\
There are also role players such has naruto's teacher and his enemies; however, they almost serve no part in the plot except getting defeated and/or teaching the gang a life lesson/ new skills.\
Enjoyment:\
I really shouldn't give it a 1, since I thoroughly enjoyed it when I was younger. But, really, if your older than 13 you should be moving on. Try Claymore or something.\
Overall:\
Do not want.\

    The mighty roar of a Kyubei vibrated throughout the area as a crowd of ninja from Konoha try their hardest to bring it to its knees. All the fighting is for naught until one person steps up and sacrifices himself to seal the Kyubei away. That man was known as the Fourth Hokage. Years later, a young orphan named Naruto causes much vandalism and trouble, just to get the attention he craves each day. His life goal is to become the next Hokage.\
Kishimoto Masashi has brought us a very long series of action, drama, and comedy about a young ninja in training known as Naruto.\
          \
        This particular series focuses on the trials and tribulations of the young shounen who has only one life goal in mind: To become the greatest Hokage in Konoha village. Along with Naruto, he has a few friends who he has earned respect from. One such colleague is more of a mentor than a friend, and that certain person is Umino Iruka-sensei. Someone who was similar to Naruto when he was growing up, so he is the first person to understand what Naruto goes through. The next few are Uchiha Sasuke and Haruno Sakura, along with their sensei Hatake Kakashi.\
Now, onto the review of this long, magnificent-until-the-filler-starts series. \
The animation of the show gets better by season, especially the opening sequence. The only qualm I have about the animation is the fighting sequences. More action, less stalemates, please. A stalemate is good now and then for a dramatic effect, but for nearly every fight starts to become tedious and boring. But I can work with it. It’s crisp and clear, and the designs of the scenery are refreshing because the structures of the villages are unique to their elemental area. Although the best designed character in my humble opinion has to be Temari and Shikamaru. Sure it is a bit of bias, but that’s only because those two are my favorite characters. Seriously, though. I like the thought of including a character such as Rock Lee to pay semi-homage to Bruce Lee.\
Although I don’t personally like the first opening song, it is a good theme for that season’s setting. The beat and rhythm of the song go well with the atmosphere, which is why it is a good pick by the Naruto crew. However I’ve listened to it too much and I don’t like it as much as when I had first heard it when I first started watching the show. I totally love the second opening song by my favorite J-Rock band Asian Kung-fu Generation. Again, it goes perfect with the atmosphere of the season and with the opening video animation. The third song is a good choice, however the singer is too high pitched to set the right mood of the song. It doesn’t mean I don’t like the song, though. I like it just fine. The singer is just too high pitched, is all. The rest of the songs are mostly J-Rock and their beats are very nice to follow. Fighting Dreamers, the fourth season opener is easy to sing along to, and that’s pretty nice. I won’t go into every single opener, so I’ll just move along to the actual soundtrack. The fighting music is good and gets you into the mood of the fight. Especially the fights Naruto participates in. That music theme is the most catchy that I have heard. But the most depressing fighting music is the theme that plays when the Hyuuga siblings duke it out in the Chuunin exams. It’s a touching match and the song really gets to you when you’re rooting for Hinata, or Neji, if you’re not fond of Hinata.\
Ah, the story. It is a magnificent story to follow a young ninja warrior’s adventures to becoming Hokage and fulfilling various missions with his group. The most compelling story is the Missing Nin arc featuring Haku and Zabuza. Ah, shounen-ai; Just kidding. These two had a really strong bond with one another except Zabuza didn’t realize it until it was too late. This arc is also the arc where we first see a glimpse of Kyubei Naruto in his first form. Although there isn’t much to say about the main story because the filler takes up most of the series. 135-215, Eesh. That’s a lot of filler. I do have to say that the first few seasons are worth purchasing, though not to purchase the fillers.\
Ah, the ever various and unique cast of Naruto. There is a character for everyone since the cast of Naruto is so vast; a character that eats a lot, to a lazy character who is a genius tactician. As I mentioned earlier, my favorite characters are Shikamaru and Temari, although Temari is from the Sand Village. \
One could get a lot of value from this series; especially rewatch value as it is a very long series of 220 episodes. Well, less if you skip the filler, which is highly recommended you do if you rewatch the series, unless you find a filler arc you enjoy, then more power to you.\
I enjoyed this series, although to be honest I haven’t completed the 220 as of now, I still have 15 to watch to complete this 220 episode anime. That’s all for now.\

    Story: Naruto is a fairly decent anime that made quite a bit of mistakes, such as turning over half of the show into fillers, and taking the show into 'god' level Dragon Ball Z style of fighting. Naruto starts out as a extremly good Ninja anime during its first season where everything you see is unexpected and the story is rather fresh and interesting, the first season including Zabuza had a perfect pace and the fight scenes felt truly of what ninjas should be.\
   After the first season however we are left with a quickly declining anime, soon the fights becomes my 'special\
          \
        move is better then yours' and it doesnt really feel like its a ninja show anymore with everyone pretty much using random attacks, which essentially turns this show into another beat em up. After a couple of seasons they start to follow in the footsteps of Dragon Ball Z.\
Art: The characters are well drawn, and the moves are flashy and nicely animated fight sequences.\
Sound: While many of the music and songs of the anime are amazing, this show became plagued with... DATTEBAYO! ('Believe it' in english)\
Character: A large array of characters with each a rather decent background, however because they wanted each character to have such a rich and fulfilling history, we became flooded with flashbacks. Also only a few characters truly stand out in terms of growth and development such as Gaara, Neji, Shikamaru and a few others.\
Enjoyment:  I decided to rate the seasons individually and then average them, with Season 1 and 5 recieving highest marks.\

    Naruto was the first anime I ever watched. And I'm glad it was. Because if I had watched for example Death Note, I think I wouldn't still be watching anime. Why is that? Naruto isn't a 'hardcore' anime. It is just plain fun and everyone can understand the storyline. While some other animes may be confusing when you first watch them, Naruto is just clear. \
Very soon I realised what the power of Naruto was. It isn't the story, which is quite cool too, but it are the characters! Everyone has their own story and their own way of thinking. Their own powers and their\
          \
        own weaknesses. This isn't something new in an anime, but Naruto does it in such a great way! It is really touching when someone is about to die, and you feel really glad if one of the main characters won a battle. \
What too is a great thing, is the whole world. The town feels realistic, although it is in a fantasy world. What I mean is that everything just feels natural and right. All the ninja ranks and how people treat eachother, it feels like a real but different world. The enviroment is beautiful too and is perfect for the battles which will take place there. \
I have been very, very positive untill now. The negative aspect of Naruto is that there are a lot of fillers. Sometimes they are just plain fun, but I really got annoyed when I found out that the episodes 120 untill about 200 are all just fillers! I quit watching and started Naruto Shippuden without missing anything of the plot.\
I would recommend this to anyone one who loves action-based animes. It is fun and probably one of the most ass-kicking animes!\

    Naruto, who doesn't know about it? It's a wildly popular series that is controversial-- oh, almost every worldwide-known series is like that. First of all, i just don't get how people keep on complaining about this series. Like, those who gave this series a one-two-three ratings, i wonder what is wrong with them? They better came up with acceptable reasons. And oh-- maybe most of them thought that they're some sort of experts just because they've seen so many other animes besides this (even though they seriously can't make any better show-- note, MAKE-- than this show). I dislike those kinds of ppl that keeps\
          \
        on complaining due to some unclear reasons. And i know that this review might get me hated somehow, but whatever. Here are my thoughts.\
The story is your stereotypical shounen-ish, capturing a parallel Ninja world, where almost everybody is a ninja and they have some cool superpowers (that's what i call), and there's this weak and stupid main character that eventually grows along the story. To me, the story is a masterpiece. Like, this is one of the first ninja shows at that time, and it pretty much introduced to us how are ninjas like. The main plot itself is unbelievably good (to me, dunno how everyone else feels), a boy that holds some kind of massive power inside of him that remains hidden, but at some moments it will come out. And i also love the idea of making 1-tailed, 2-tailed until 9-tailed monsters, that really got me. Aaand also the awesome techniques and awesome creatures. Until this point, i like almost everything from the story. It quickly catches our attention and it easily makes everyone to sit back and enjoy the show. I watched this show for the first time when i was 10, and like all kids, i instantly got hooked. Indeed, it has some undeniable flaws, like its cliche and guessable story, and maybe some spots of gary stu, to say. But, isn't that all shounen series all about? How the main character who was nothing in the beginning, began to grow and finally becomes something? It was okay enough for me. The fights themselves were also fun and made me eager to watch, and it's even okay to watch it again and again. It's never boring and to me, the story never grows old. Well, Naruto is one of my childhood memories so i might sounded a little bit biased. But that is to me.\
The characters are-- god, there were like tons of them. Besides the main characters there were absolutely lots of supporting characters that appeared just in some stories and later never showed up again. I absolutely love the way they designed the characters with their unique traits, and note that the design has lots of varieties and i was never bored to see some new characters appearing because they're not the same, they're different. I sometimes thought how could ppl design so many people (because in my case, it's so hard to draw even 10 different faces). Well, Kishimoto looked really professional on designing the characters. Lots of different types of hairstyles (from the normal one until the absurd one), clothes (this one is definitely amusing), and so on. The animation itself is pretty colorful to me, and fight scenes (which is the soul of this series) were drawn neatly. And the sound effects--- for god's sake, i love the BGMs!! There are dozens-- or maybe more-- of sound effects, background musics, and opening-ending song in this anime. 220 episodes is not a short one, and they definitely made it not boring with the music. I could note some songs that i really like coming from Naruto. Toshiro Masuda really, really gave me the thrills with his awesome BGMs whenever we're watching some scenes and then dramatic BGMs that absolutely fits the story begins to play. Music is one of the best aspects in this series, tho. I even downloaded some of them to escort me on doing things. Yeah right.\
Naruto... is a really enjoyable series. Indeed, as i stated before, it's not perfect. No series are perfect. The best series ever known also came up with some minor flaws. And so is Naruto. Maybe you guys are irritated with the characters, or maybe the typical storyline, or maybe the absurd length of this series, you guys have your own opinions. I'm not a professional or whatsoever, i'm just an ordinary kid who enjoys watching animes. And these are my opinions.\

    First to say: I decided to write a review for one of my favorite animes even though there are more than enough reviews. My anime addiction is indebted to this series because this  was the one that invited me to the otaku world...\
Story (7/10)\
Naruto's story revolved around a obnoxious kid named Naruto, if you don't like him, then it's not very likely that you'll love the series. \
The plot is a bit shallow and a bit of a cliche; a stupid main character who wants to attempt the impossible and has a hidden power behind his sadness having stereotypical nakamas to protect. Simply to\
          \
        say it is the journey of Naruto to become the best; however, he has to face conflicts within himself, with others and with the world as well.\
Don't expect psychology, deep philosophy, and thought provoking issues here because Naruto was made for the general audience and tackles drama within the character's personal  lives as teenage ninjas, there are almost no societal issue here and war and politics are not a prominent figure. The story is about lives. The life of a ninja here is portrayed in a comedic and adventurous way in the eyes of mostly innocent youths who in time, will be able to learn about its darkness.\
But what made Naruto so lovable? It is the universe it created. The villages, the clans and the people's lifestyle are so fun to learn about, they are so fun to be in. Plot twists are plentiful and the characters' interactions are very exciting. \
But the heart of Naruto fandom is the ACTION; loved characters fighting with their well loved skills. Each of them has unique attributes coming from their bloodline or they developed personally. Most of the time, they think while they fight resulting into exciting clashes of logic and tactics. Their powers also have 'scientific explanations' from the make-up science in this show giving room for countless forums and fan speculations where their strengths and weaknesses are discussed; example is \"who will win if...\"\
However, I was displeased with the development of the series; it started out really good but after episode 140 or so the anime was filled with useless fillers, totally useless and unenjoyable.They really ruined the show; It was a real disappointment to fans that the transition to Naruto Shippudden was a total disgrace.\
Overall the story is very addictive and will keep you glued to the screen until the fillers came.\
\
Art (7/10)\
The character designs are very simple yet memorable, no character looked alike and each other and each has trademark outfits, which were not very detailed. Eyes, noses, mouths and hair are nothing special making Naruto characters one of the easiest to draw.I also loved the use of symbols, such as the Konoha leaf and Naruto's spiral, they leave a considerable amount of impression to viewers.\
The houses, shops, fashion, and art in general in Naruto are both landlord era and modern anime style inspired.\
Yet the animation was very inconsistent; there are times when faces are so ugly and the action scenes, which are excellent, are poorly drawn (especially at the fillers).\
Sound (8/10)\
What I can say about the music of Naruto is that it is appropriate. The music was heavily Japanese themed and gives you a \"ninja\" feel. Though not exceptional it is not disappointing; if the scene is sad, the music will make you even sadder, and when there is action, the music will pump up your adrenalin. The opening and ending themes are quite enjoyable and addictive, making them highly anticipated.\
But the length of the series made the music overly used and lacking in variation.\
Character(7/10)\
This part is very debatable...It is also the part that made Naruto hated by many, the main characters and also some secondary characters) are cliches:\
A boy who has a hidden power triggered if his nakama is in danger and wins over strong opponents by willpower\
A rival who is smart with looks better than the main character, fan-girled too much and has some dark undertone.\
A girl obsessed with the 'rival' who is liked by the unliked main character whom she constantly bullies\
Mostly the characters are a bit shallow but they are worthy to be loved. Some of them are inspiring, some irritating, some cute, some has psychotic attributes and some are cool depending on a person's preference: a very good formula for a shonen anime. They are not mediocre and their role in the story is noteworthy as many of them develops significantly as the series progresses, whereas each has his or own internal or external conflict. \
Naruto promotes many important values such as friendship, family, hardwork and  maturity with its characters.I find it inspirational and heartwarming. I also loved its concept of having a \"home\"and  to belong to and having a \"dream\" to work hard for. Overall the atmosphere is positive here.\
HOWEVER, the fillers made room for too many cheap, sissy dramas and trying-hard-to-be-deep- characters who are very unnecessary. The plentiful unnecessary flashbacks also ruin some climatic parts and made the drama bland.\
But Naruto isn't very shallow at all. One can see it's unforced efforts to bring symbolism; a character living in bloodshed was associated to the pureness of snow, the blooming of flower as a metaphor for growth, and the leaves of the village compared to the next generation or the progression of time.\
Angst and sadness is plentiful here but they are viewed from the eyes of pre-teens and pre-teens are mostly shallow no matter how deep they think they are. But it doesn't mean that the drama is shallow, it was just portrayed naturally from the characters' point of view.\
Naruto, though he is a typical shonen hero, has a different effect on people and has an amazing power to impact both the characters of the show and audiences alike. His development is superb: from a naughty, proud and idiotic outcast kid he strove hard to be recognized by following his way of a ninja to become an inspiration to everybody.\
Enjoyment (9/10)\
I loved it so much...I've been addicted to it for three years. Even though I watch new series, Naruto still remain in my top list. My experience in watching this is very different from other shonens, and conversing with fans alike will make you feel very welcomed in loving this series.I can extract endless fun information from the series and fansites. It is just that the fillers really ruined the mood...\
Naruto is not exceptional in every aspect(except action and comedy perhaps) if you compare it to very artistically done animes but it may be the best in one thing: earning people with unconditonal fandom despite its weaknesses. Isn't it a very rare attribute?\
\"It's just popular but not really good.\" Then why is it popular in the first place? It is because the majority loved it and don't care about its flaws. Naruto is very age-friendly and gender friendly, and a very well composed shonen.\
So heed my final words: exposure to this material may cause long term addiction\

    This has to be one of the worst anime series I've seen, and I've seen 240 anime series.  Now that's saying a lot.\
Ok now on to some of the things that made it so bad.  First is the so called story that's supposed to take place I guess two hundred years ago.  Yet they have tv and radio, so when the heck is this anime supposed to take place.  Now as for the story which makes no lick of sense to me revolves around Naruto, Sakura,  and Sasuke on a journey to become the best ninjas.  Which wouldn't have\
          \
        been so bad had the creators focused  on one type of anime instead of over blowing three of them from comedy, drama, action.  Just focus one one and have the other two has secondary.  Next lets move on to perhaps the worst part of the the show, the characters.  I'll focus on Naruto.  He is perhaps the most annoying main character I've seen in a anime series.  Every episode I watched, I wanted him to die more and more, I couldn't look past him in the show.  The other two main characters weren't nearly as bad as him, I might have given a little better score if they got rid of Naruto and focused on Sakura and Sasuke.  Ok moving on to the so called action.  First it's ridiculous, not very exciting, and drawn out through 2 to 3 episodes.  Finally there's the length of the so called series.  There's 240 episodes, plus another series, a few movies and some OVAs.  I truly believe the creators and the company that own Naruto are just milking pre-teen and young teenagers of their and their parents money.  Now don't get me wrong I know studios are trying to make money, but theirs a difference between making  money and ripping people off.\
So please don't support this show anymore.\

    Wow... I look back and realize how painfully mediocre Naruto is compared to all the Anime I have watched recently... Its a shonen series, but it isnt really special... Just another addition to the 'boredom-inducing-fillertastic' pile of anime in the end. It seems that many people have overrated this series because it was one of their first series, and they havent really watched many series anyways... -just a thought (All you hardcore fans keep reading, I explain myself)\
Overall: Naruto had the setup to be something epic, though the length and the way they tell the story completely destroyed what chance they had at becoming epic.\
          \
        They dragged out the story to include useless extra stuff, and though the characters had some depth, they kept trying to add more depth and not really adding much at all, just wasting time. The whole of Naruto is filled with episodes where you dont really get anywhere both in character development and story development, even the non-filler episodes did not do that well in developing the series in general. I admit, I liked watching Naruto at first, when I didnt really have much experience with much anime, now I look back and man does it look like crap compared to things like Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion or Tengen Toppan Gurren Lagann, or even Black Lagoon, I can understand why people that are fresh into anime are easily turned into 'Narutards' now, just like the 'Pokemaniacs' back in the day. This series is on a path that leads to a 'Inuyasha' kind of standing.\
Story: Kid wants to be mayor of ninja town, ok thats nice, but has he REALLY gotten much further to ACTUALLY becoming 'Hokage' in the last 200+ eps of this roundabout story? fillers killed what little naruto had in story. The way they stretched the story to encompass EVERY LITTLE THING is its main flaw, little side stories are nice and everything, but if you overdo it, you are just adding a giant mass of fat to the bone, no meat. If they just made Naruto something like a 2 season shot or something less then 50 episodes, then there might have been an epic anime that is worthy of being in the group of truly great anime.\
Art: meh... its not anywhere near as impressive as Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex with its 30million yen budget per episode, but it at least doesnt have any major flaws, though the art seems pretty bland sometimes, other times, the art is overly complex for what they are trying to show, but usually there isnt much of a problem in art.\
Sound: i never really liked the kind of atmosphere that the background music made me feel, it wasnt epic, the background music didnt really fit the situations very well, for example the overpowering flute in most of the bmg and the apparent manly 'HUA!' that is overused do not really set much of a mood, I understand that there is a theme towards more traditional Japanese type of music, but it doesnt work well in many cases, there are way too many times where it just wont set the mood right and they beat the crap out of the dead horse, its hard to explain very well, Im raising my score to a 5 because AKFG and Sambomaster sang openings for it and they worked well with the anime.\
Character: There is a very large cast in Naruto, though its usually a bad thing, they made it work somewhat. Even though the characters are somewhat deep, they all consist of cliched stereotypical shonen characters and do not have much to set them apart from the giant mass of other shonen story characters, also nothing EVER changes in the personality of the main character, Naruto, though he is cheerful, optimistic and energetic, he never realizes the reality he lives in and due to a lot of dumb luck and his gift of insane power he passes all his trials and tribulations, he is so naive that it is painful to watch, he almost never has a mature or realistic look on things, EXCEPT FOR HIS FEUD WITH SASUKE, even then he still does not have a mature attitude in many situations. His development is like Arika in 'Mai-Otome', painfully naive, though he doesnt even advance as far as Arika in maturing, at least she somewhat matured throughout the story. There are good characters in the mix, for example, Shikamaru and Garaa are pretty well developed characters that have promise. However with all that said, Naruto kills EVERYTHING in character, its amazing how dumb he is sometimes, dumb to the point where he should get himself checked for mild autism, unfortunately he usually blocks out the possibility of good mature side characters with his obnoxiousness. I guess there was more then one reason people tended to stay away from Naruto, besides the fact he has a fire fox's spirit sealed within him.\
Enjoyment: it was enjoyable when I started watching it and it stayed that way for about 100 episodes, then it just tanked... now I have no intention of taking this up again. The amount of entertainment is not enough to keep me interested, nothing like Detective Conan, which nearly only uses its entertainment value to keep me interested.\

        Hm... Naruto as a series is a difficult one to review. It's almost 'cool' and 'accepted' to say this mainstream anime is overhyped and cliche. If one were to gush about Naruto one would immediately jump to the conclusion that they are a child, naive, or just new to anime. \
   Naruto is a story about a orphan kid who becomes a ninja. If you look at Naruto's story objectively it's actually pretty good. It has all the stuff you would likely want in a story; rivalries, fighting, ninjas, friendship, philosophical moralizing etc... What ultimately makes this shounen different\
          \
        from say a DBZ or a Bleach is that all these things are all woven better into the story making a better cohesive story. There aren't any real devastating plot twists that come from nowhere in Naruto. The most important things that happen are foreshadowed a good deal throughout. Each arc ultimately ties into the next unlike a DBZ and the degradation in story isnt as quick as a Bleach. The story is woven and complete (IMO) throughout the 100+ episodes.\
   The characters in the show is another huge plus. Sure the titular character, Naruto, is irritating but the real strength here is the wealth of background characters in Naruto. Each of them through the series (manga related episodes) are given, for lack of better words, their time to shine. The themes related to each character also makes for interesting dialogue between them. Which brings me to dialogue which is another standout. The tone shifts quite abit through the 150ish episodes but the humor, dramatic scenes, or moralizing/psuedo-philosophical stuff all come off reasonably natural. \
   Next the music is reasonably good. It has a nice feel to the music and it fits the scene pretty well. The theme 'Sadness and Sorrow' is a nice piece but tends to be overplayed in the dramatic places. \
   By now you probably realized that I really liked Naruto, I watched it years ago but I still enjoy watching an episode here and there. I was a little discouraged when people my age were beginning to shut out Naruto for more 'edgier' animes. I dont think someone should put down Naruto because it's a kid show. Sure it's a little silly here and there but ultimately watching it makes a dam good time. I've watched a good share of animes but I have to say Naruto is still the most fun (doesn't mean its the best). Rejecting the things that were important in your youth seems almost natural but in this case it's unwarranted. Watch, enjoy. Rewatch, enjoy more.\

    Naruto (also referred to as \"Ninja Brokeback Mountain\") is an anime about sand ninjas and eugenics. It is a gateway anime of the worst kind riddled with one-dimensional characters who lack development, poor pacing, numerous plot holes, shitty villains who \"aren't really so bad in the end\", an anime saturated in filler arcs, a final arc with a complicated mess of a plot that stretched on for a year, massive use abuse of plot armor to cover up shitty writing, and a story of \"friendship\" which somehow makes Boku No Pico look like Metal Gear Solid in comparison. Despite this, it is one of /a/'s\
          \
        guilty pleasures due to being a massive lolcow which has provided them with lulz for 15 years. The story is about a blonde-haired, afro hairstyled, blue-eyed, half-emo, foreigner half-demon ninja teen struggling to be accepted into society by being a whiny fagget who annoys everyone around him, including the viewers. His goal is to become Hokage Ninja Obama and change the world. To accomplish this he becomes a ninja who dresses in bright colors, doesn't into stealth, announces his presence to his enemies, literally only uses 2 jutsus for the entirety of the series, forgives mass murderers, and rather than killing enemies would rather give gay speeches about bonds and friendship and other shit. In fact, He is such a failure of a ninja that the plot replaced him with Sasuke \"Edge-Lord\" Uchiha as the main character halfway through the story due to Kishimoto's boner for his favorite character. One of the many themes in Naruto that are ultimately ignored is that hard work surpasses talent which is shown in how Naruto and Sasuke become the most overpowered characters by having perfect bloodlines and literally being handed power ups while characters like Rock Lee are ultimately forgotten by the plot. Great writing there, Kishimoto! Another lesson Naruto teaches is that if you stalk someone long enough, they will change their mind about you and will run back into your arms. Considering that the entire lolcow of a fanbase is full of basement dwelling beta-male autists whose last encounter with a real vagina was during their birth and obese 16 year old fangirls who devote their entire lives to their OTPs, It's easy to see why Naruto has managed to last as long as it did by appealing to autistic weeaboos. All 700 fucking chapters of this sh*t.\

    I laughed, i cried and i was excited. In other words there were everything in this anime what necessary to a long anime like Naruto :) As i was watching it i didn't feel that it was waste i watched such a long anime. \
I liked Naruto's character so much. Naruto is a freaky, dumb and unlucky person who was always outcasted by the people in the village. However later he became a careful, strong guy who passes everyone's expection and surprise them. He's been helped by his friends and he's able to move forward by their assistance. He thinks Sasuke as a friend during\
          \
        the whole time what they spend together in the Team 7 it's (maybe) because Sasuke is also lonely after he lost his parents. I've learnt a lot from this anime. \
The voice actors were great. Even though i was surprised that Takeuchi Junko is Naruto's voice still i think she is the best for Naruto. \
The opening and ending songs fitted to the anime very well. Especially the FLOW songs. I liked almost all of the soundtracks in it. \
I like its grafic. I suppose it's unique. \
To sum up i gave 9/10 to it. \

    Naruto is a gateway anime of the worst kind. It's a bad series, a clusterfuck of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive shipping faggotry and DARKNESS. A normal person can see this as the shit it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the series itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.\
However, these very aspects that try to smear over the shit of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable younger audience\
          \
        who engage in every kind of stupidity both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the jutsus, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole ninja act and everything about the Naruto world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on revenge, and overall preachiness of the series make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of shit that makes little kiddies eat this shit right the fuck up.\
Naruto is basically THE series to attract the most hated anime fanbase known to the Internet, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every person to troll the fuck out of this show and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no Naruto discussions ever encourage the fans of this show to show their faces.\

    Naruto has to be the most over rated anime in existance. Every kid who has never seen anything else besides pokemon and dragon ball Z all give it rave reveiws, but all the experienced anime watchers know better.

    Naruto is a hit and miss with some people. You can hate or appreciate; that's how it works. Most people say that Naruto is a pretty bad anime, and in reality, it's not. While there are obvious shortcomings and issues, there are also some really good parts in this anime that probably anyone would enjoy.\
Of course, what is Naruto, really? Well, it's a story about a boy named Uzumaki Naruto, whose dream is to become the Hokage, or, top ninja. This is an incredible feat, of course, and only some one extraordinary could achieve such a feat. However, he is different. Naruto's path is (and\
          \
        will) be very difficult, since an incident many years ago left him with a demon, the Kyuubi, sealed inside his body. The Kyuubi is a beast with exceptional power that nearly destroyed the Village of Konohagure, Naruto's village. His village disgraces him for his powers not because of the boy himself, but out of fear that the power will return one day. Naruto wants to prove the villagers wrong and become Hokage, and protect them. He will, of course, need special training in order to become so, and also the necessary training that all ninja trainees get in order to succeed. Will he? You will just have to watch.\
Now, what do I think about Naruto? Well, being a USA resident, I was first subjected to the dubbed version all those years ago. I had read The Shonen Jump pilot manga years ago, and with technology not being as advanced as now, watching subbed episodes without importing and learning Japanese was impossible, so I was subjected to watching the dubbed episodes. Of course, being a longtime anime fan, I was not impressed, compared to other anime's that I had watched prior (that were dubbed). My luck changed eventually, and subbing groups were formed and I had gotten what I wanted. The original, un-edited content and blood that the cut-dry dubbed version did not have. Alas, my opinion changed. I was left satisfied and it exceeded my expectations. \
Now, now. Naruto is not the greatest anime that I've ever seen. However, it does not suck. The character development goes at the speed you would expect it to, and Naruto does leave behind characters that you will remember (and ones that you will want to forget -- Sasuke, anyone?) The animation, amongst other things, is good, and battles in-depth (although it might take some time for the characters to move.. just to waste time, really). Now, the last part comes up to you. Naruto, like I said before, is a hit-or-miss. You either fall in love with the concept, or you hate it to the core. Personally, I don't. I like the ninja action and the plot development. You may not. That's the point - Naruto is what you make of it. It may be the best thing you ever see, or the worst. Now all you need to do is find out for yourself.\

    Okay an honest review here truthfully this is one of my favorite anime, but there are things that i liked about the show and things that i hated about the anime. I enjoy the story, it starts of very simple but it gets deeper as you go on through the series, however it never explained why naruto dressed in orange. \
the art is amazing i love their style especially in the fighting scenes, i can see that they worked very hard on those scenes and i feel they did the anime some justice with they're art.\
The OST and the sound effects were awesome, it matched\
          \
        the Anime well, it made the fights more intense and also made a lot more scenes come to life.\
The Character all came in at the right time in the first season the main characters it focused on was Naruto, Saskue, Sakura, and Kakashi. Naruto was the most explained character, to be honest he was a terrible ninja in this series and should have died. Saskue is a very skilled ninja on the other hand and everyone likes him. Sakura, i can simply say i grew to hate her, as the story goes on she just makes everything worse. Kakashi is a mystery the whole time, you learn very little about him in this series.\
This anime is very enjoyable, but they are very repetitive with the flashbacks i don't mind flashbacks but if they keep repeating the same flashback that they showed a few episodes back it gets annoying, but the action keeps you in the show to be completely honest, the explanation of the abilities is also interesting some people hate it, but i like it, it's your opinion about that. also if you don't like filler after ep 135 go to 220 and skip the 1st half lol.\
overall i give it an 8/10 i personally think this show isn't overated its just people want others to see it.\

    Although Naruto is sometimes overexaggerated with the way it has somehow been 'stolen from other manga artists' and it isn't creative. Naruto, although very simple character, has a great personality and proves that he is able to do anything so long as he sets his mind to it. With his friends and Konohagakure no Sato behind him, he sets his mind on becoming Hokage, the greatest ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village. That does not omit the fact that Naruto has other infamous characters that are loved.\
Uchiha Sasuke - the character that every girl seems to love (besides myself. Naruto fangirl here), and the somewhat\
          \
        antagonist of the story was meant to die at the beginning of the series. So far, he seems to always have a way of slipping through everyone's hands, and has a demeanor that just says to everyone he looks at, 'Back off.'\
Haruno Sakura - the girl that has a major crush on Sasuke, who Naruto has a crush on, and with the undeniable passion to do what she wishes. Although considered the weakest of the Konoha 9, Sakura has a knack for chakra control, and Inner Sakura seems to give her a bit of a teenage look about her. What girl doesn't have her own inner self that screams out what she wishes to say?\
Hatake Kakashi - the man that leads the group. A jounin beyond his years, Kakashi helps Sasuke most of the time, but in the end realizes his mistake of not helping out Naruto at all. This leads to him wanting to keep everyone safe, so it helps a lot of people. \
I personally adore Naruto. It gives me an insight of what I could be if I were an anime character. That character would be Sakura, no doubt. In the end, though, Naruto does have its kinks to work out, but it will surely become a masterpiece that I wish for my children to look back on. Allowing something like this to be able to be published lets my life understand that it is a brilliant world in my imagination!\

    Naruto (not Naruto Shippuden) is awesome. It had a nice setting, character development, plot, and fighting scenes. The thing I enjoyed most about Naruto was its character development. The diverse array of characters in Naruto all (with the exception of Ten-ten and a few other people) had their spotlight and unique identities. I especially liked Naruto because he was the hard-working underdog.\
You also get these bad-ass fighting scenes. These fighting scenes, I felt, actually made sense. There weren't many nakama-power ups, and the good people didn't always win. Everyone was limited by chakra. You also get some cool strategies!\
I really enjoyed this series. And even\

    NARUTARDS BEWARE\
Let me start off by saying that I, like many others, watch this show immediately after very popular anime like Dragon ball z, Yu Yu Hakusho, Trigun, so I thought that this show was great, though some things always stuck out in my mind.\
That being said, let me move on to this, Naruto TANKED, FAILED, SUCKED, WOMPED, AND ALL AROUND NOT GOOD after the Rock Lee vs Garra fight, (around ep 50 ish)although looking back it was not that great before that. \
Story:\
Very mediocre, 'I want to be the ______ strongest and best ________ so that everyone will ________!!!!!!!!!!' Seen it all before, he\
          \
        wants people to notice him because he didn't have any friends and has a demon fox inside of him that he conveniently didn't began to use until the beginning of the series. Now I would like to digress to a few things that I notice, First Naruto claims that nobody talked/acknowledged him but then he is shown eating with Choji, sleeping with kiba, and running from the hokage? with Shikamaru when they were all younger, now I no expert but that sounds like friends to me. Second is on the first episode, a YOUNG, UNTRAINED NINJA WANNABE and a mediocre older ninja managed to steal a highly 'important' scroll that teaches someone something that alot of people already know (shadow clone). anyway, the story suck because usually when someone says they are going to do something (especially when it's so close to there reach) they do it, Naruto it no closer to become Hokage than he was 200+ episodes ago. LOL I don't even need to talk about the fillers since its been killed and rekilled.\
Art:\
Everyone says its so great but has anyone else noticed that in at least 2 fights (team 7 vs girl Orochimaru and Sasuke vs Naruto) the animation changed drastically in the middle of the fight...........'nuf said.\
Sound:\
No real complaints other than, that music gets annoying after a while, I mean the HUH one, and some of the VA's are annoying.\
Character:\
Oh yes, now first SOME OF THE CHARACTERS DON'T HAVE PASTS!!!!!!!!!! yea I suppose people like Shino and Ten Ten had absolutely nothing of importance happen to them, and while on the subject of Ten Ten, the author of Naruto HIMSELF said the Ten Ten iss just a FILLER character, acting only to fill in the place of the female character in Guys team..........what type of crap is the a filler main character, also there are no character (outside of filler) interactions, I'd like to see Lee and Hinata have a conversation, I'd like to see Kiba and Neji chat it up. Naruto is just plan annoying his attitude changes to much, one minute he's destroying the villages monument and the next he's risking his life for one dude, and what's up with this I will get Sasuke back no matter what it so annoying, has he given up on being Hokage? The saving graces of the characters are Kakashi, Shikamaru, and a few others that they almost never show. One more thing the characters almost never change, Kiba has been the same( from what they've shown) since the beginning so has Sasuke, Sakura, Lee, ALL FEMALE CHARACTERS etc, etc\
Enjoyment:\
like I said, at first I enjoyed it, then it just starting getting.........Awful.\
Overall:\
A good started anime, but for people who have seen things other than Digimon, Pokemon, Dbz, anything on Adult swim, and Sailor moon, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS!!!!!!!!!! \

    As a big anime fan, i watched many different animes, maybe not as much as most people, but still enough to find what i liked and disliked, and Naruto is definately not in those choces of in between, it,s plain flat hatred, at first i was obsessed with the anime, and now i do NOT understand why... seriousely... it,s really disapointing, Naruto is the most viewed and probably the most loved shounen manga/animes ever....  i seriousely don't get why people are so hooked on it, it's clichéd and overused\
Story: 1\
A kid who's parents died (right there, cliché) when she was a baby (cliché) has\
          \
        the dream to become the leader of his village (cliché) and has a crush on a girl (cloché) who hates him and likes another guy (cliché) who is way cooler (cliché), those three end up in the same team (cliché) with a teacher who wants to unite them better (cliché).... That's the basic story, alot of things happen obviousely, but i just can't find anything that really ATTRACTS me to the story well.. and i,m a huge fan of shounen, many of my friends don,t even believe i'm a girl because of that, so i have a pretty good eye to compare, and when i compare between this anime and another shorter/better story, i would definately pick another anime... the story is too long and too boring after a while, many of my friends stopped reading/watching it because it took too long, they simply don't care about the end anymore.\
Art: 8\
Art was pretty good, that was one thing i didn't hate about the anime, it's pretty basic and simple to draw, and it's also easier to imitate drawing characters like those, but i can't give the art a 10, because it was too simple, sure most people will tell me what the hell i'm talking about since art isn't what matters most, i know that, but i'm trying to look for reasons to not give this anime a 0, catch my drift?\

    Overview:\
Naruto has been going strong for 15 years now and is one of the most popular anime in the world. What exactly does this series do so well to gain such a massive fandom? Let's jump through some poorly animated trees and into a world where stealth assassins wear bright orange jump suits! This is Naruto!\
Story: 6/10\
Naruto takes place in a world where  ninjas are extremely common and perform many tasks: messengers, body guards, assassins, scientists, and even national leaders. The ninjas in this show don't actually conform to the stereotypes portrayed in cinema. In fact, they are often so far removed from everything\
          \
        associated with ninja that they may as well just be called mutants or super heroes. What the hell does telepathically controlling sand have to do with being a ninja? I played Tenchu on the PS1 and I sure as hell wasn't killing people with fucking sand! Anyways, the plot follows the hyperactive, rambunctious, yet highly ambitious Naruto Uzumaki and his goal to become leader of his ninja village. Naruto has lived as an outcast his entire life because he has a demonic 9 tailed fox sealed inside him by his father. His father did this in order to stop the rampaging 9 tails from destroying the village and it ended up costing him his life. Naruto must use his powers to slowly win the trust and respect of his village and his fellow ninja team mates. The beginning of the series features a lot of training and tedious explanation of \"chakra\" and other concepts of the Naruto world. The story actually starts getting interesting when Naruto must take a special test called the Chuunin exam in order to gain a higher rank and go on more dangerous missions. I won't attempt to explain 15 years of plot in this small review, but trust me that the plot goes on FAR longer than necessary. Kishimoto keeps creating new enemies in order to drag it on longer and longer. Just when the latest big bad is defeated, we get to hear a sob story and learn that big bad #120 was actually being controlled by big bad #121, who it will turn out is merely a puppet in the schemes of #122. The plot is also bogged down by god awful filler that ranks among the worst shonen filler EVER! Ok, well not as bad as Inuyasha's filler, but still bad.\
Character: 6/10\
Naruto has a LOT of characters, some of whom are interesting and fun to watch and some of whom are an absolute pain in the ass. Unfortunately, Naruto is one of least interesting characters in the whole series. He redefines what it means to be a generic shonen hero cliche'. Sasuke spends the vast majority of the series being a whiny little twat that you just want to bitch slap. Sakura's affection for Sasuke seems extremely misplaced and she doesn't do anything useful until Shippuden starts...after episode 220. Hinata is actually one of the interesting characters. Like Shinji from Evangelion, she is the socially awkward, overwhelmed, nervous wreck that the otaku at home will probably most identify with. I'm certainly a LOT more Hinata than I am Naruto and I am willing to wager that so is nearly everyone else. Her struggles aren't so much about taking down impossibly strong villains, but learning how to express her feelings and get over her introversion and social anxiety. The real world nature of these problems make them infinitely more identifiable for the viewer. One of my other favorites is Gaara, who starts out as a lonely yet psychopathic ninja that brutally murders everyone that crosses his path. However, the show actually tries to make him sympathetic and largely succeeds. We get to see him slowly redeem himself and even become his country's leader. Apparently if you are strong in this world, your countless murders of innocent people are simply waved away and you can get selected to lead a nation. Hell yeah! Lucy/Gaara 2016! My other favorite characters include the absolute badass Itachi and pretentious artist Deidara.\
Sound: 8/10\
The soundtrack features many memorable openings and closings along with kickass instrumentals to pump up the fight scenes. Naruto also has just the right music to make tragic scenes moving and happy scenes more fun. It isn't the perfect anime soundtrack, but it is solid throughout.\
Art: 6/10\
The art isn't the greatest ever, but it isn't bad. You also have to consider the budgetary constraints of having a 500+ episode series when you groan at the use of poorly animated 3 second loops of characters jumping through trees. God damn Sasuke retrieval arc!\
Enjoyment: 3/10\
In Heart of Darkness we are left with the famous last utterance of Kurtz, \"the horror, the horror!\" In Naruto this would be \"The filler...the filler!\" Seriously, the awful filler content along with the tedious explanations whenever anyone uses any technique, make this series often painful to watch. I recommend the far superior manga. \
Overall: 6/10\
Naruto has some things that it admittedly does quite well, along with a substantial list of flaws. I would ultimately say that it is a very average series. It is a good introduction to anime for the uninitiated, but there are honestly far better anime out there. There is also far, far worse. I'm not going to be the anime snob that tells young teens that Naruto is the single worst anime ever created. That would be a complete lie. I've sat through Ikki Tousen, Najika Blitz Tactics and Seikon no Qwasar, so I know what I'm fucking talking about.\

    I believe that Naruto is in fact, if not the most, one of the most overrated and overestimated animes I have seen.\
First of all, most characters seem very generic, and the some chracters (ESPECIALLY female) lack usefulness. Before you tell me I'm wrong, think about this: If YOU were to be watching a fight where your comrades and close friends may be fighting for their lives and chance to save yours, would YOU be there at the sides shouting their names and probably just distracting them, or would you stand up and fight along? Of course, at some point these certain characters did change. But\
          \
        it would have been much better to make them at least a little more gutsy now, and have them progress later. Actually I would've rated their character even lower if it weren't for their development.\
Then, we have the endless supply of fillers. (And so I pray, Unlimited Naruto filler works.) These fillers are episodes which have no real relation to the plot and are created for the sole reason of making the episode longer. Honestly, I think having some fillers are good, because if all episodes were following a plot, the series would go very fast. The fact that they introduce us to new characters doesn't change anything except if that character has a relation to the plot.\
So, at first glance based on people saying how great this is, you may be thinking 'Ah, this is a pretty good series!' But you then start watching it, then you get bored of the fillers and sick of the useless characters that don't seem to die.\
Personally, I actually would have continued with the next season if it wasn't for the fear of having to go through a whole bunch of fillers again.\

    I used to think that naruto was an ok show. But then I realized there is no point in watching an anime that will NEVER END! Even after 220 episodes they still refuse to end it. Instead they make a sequel!And naruto is also the most annoying main character ever. after the 500th 'believe it!'  the catch phrase tends to get annoying. one of the most annoying parts of the show are the flash backs.it gets really annoying when they show flash backs about the time that character stole a piece of bread or something right in the middle of an epic battle. another\
          \
        thing that isn't really annoying but is kinda weird is that this show has head sets, giant televisions, stoves, cameras, etc but no cars or guns. just a little odd. so unless you have a thing for anime that doesn't have an ending, and has annoying characters this probably isn't an anime for you.\

    Okay. Well, at first, I saw my brother watching this series. At first I was like 'what is this series?' Then I heard about this Naruto thing. So I decided to check it. I read the biograpy and was amazed of the plot. I'm not really a fan of action. But this series is not only about fighting. You will not like Naruto if you don't know the real story of it. Some of my classmates are saying that 'Naruto sucks!' And I'm just saying that 'You just don't know the story. That's why you hate it.' Each of the characters has their own talents,\

        dreams, and sad pasts. Especially Naruto, Gaara, and Sasuke. Sometimes I'm annoyed that there are tons of characters in the story. \
I gave all 10 because the story is great, especially the art. All of the characters has unique looks. Character, all of them has a story and has their own dreams, it made me inspired. Enjoyment, sometimes my mother would ask me if I'm crazy or something. I mean, laughing, talking, and crying  in front of the computer? xD\
Overall, 10 Outsanding. =)\
This is the very first Japanese dubbed anime I've ever watched. The anime I've watched is either in English or Tagalog dub. This anime made me addict and interested in anime. Before, I didn't know anything about anime. So, yeah.\
Okay, I'll stop now. xD\

    First off: The fillers are definately not worth watching ( probably the only exception is ep101 or 105, can't remember which, where Naruto and crew tried to get Kakashi to reveal what's under his mask). They are just random episodes made out of the blue, and contain no storyline whatsoever ( unlike the Bount Arc).\
Story up to the end of ...: This part of Naruto got me glued to my monitor. The plot rapidly unfolds in this arc, and new characters rapidly intoduced. Lots of wonderful fighting scenes, with little or no character. Very good.\
After the aforementioned arc to beginning of filler season: here characters\
          \
        are explored to more detail, also the plot is made more complex. Some good action scenes here, of course the best one being the fight between X and X. However, after this point, the plot deteriorates, it became dull and generic.Humours are used in an attempt to maintain audience attention, but became predictable as the story goes. \
Overall: There are many shorter, more interesting series out there with the same genre. If you, however, enjoy extended series, you might find Naruto enjoyable.\

    Characters/Development\
Although the beginning of the story may not give much of an impression and suggest the characters are going to be having childish adventures together. The series is actually much different than expected which does get interesting the further the story develops. Of course to be expected there are many fight sequences adding a lot of action to the series, but more on that later.\
Throughout Naruto there are many different story arcs which usually link together explaining the plot more in depth filling some holes, teaching us pieces of the past or developing certain characters more. The series however does tend to drag on a\
          \
        lot for each episode or fight sequences which may take a while to conclude. Many flashbacks are also included which take two different approaches. One that develop the character or explain an event either briefly or in depth. One that are to remind the audience of previous episodes, sometimes even during the early moments of an episode. The latter tend to get boring and eventually rather annoying. Added into the mix of things are a few emotional moments for characters and some comedy which might give a chuckle but nothing too hilarious except one or two events.\
The characters in this series are rather unique in several ways. They each have their very own skills, ambitions and views upon certain matters. Most of the characters are focused on the younger generation, while there are still plenty of the older generation to experience, creating a large collection of likable or dislikeable characters. To pick a few, we have Naruto who appears to be quite dumb in understanding things, but has a good heart and knows how to get out of sticky situations during combat. His views can be quite mature for his age and the audience may sympathise with him at times. Then we have Sasuke who is the quiet vengeful type, of whom is seeking to kill his brother and the revival of his clan. Although having a dark atmosphere around him he can worry about his team and even become jealous of Naruto. We than have Sakura who appears to be a sweet girl, having her heart set on Sasuke, yet she can get in some bad tempers and show her other personality. Finally you have Kakashi, the team leader of the three, of adult age, who can be quite a likable character. He loves reading romance themed books of a certain series and is constantly later when meeting up with the team. Throughout the series, the skills and ways of each character is reflected in one way or another so we can learn the way they are like on the battlefield or within a group.\
The combat is a little different than expected at a slower pace and being tactical rather than having much physical contact. Lots of thrown weapons are used, or types of hand seals, which can either, improve an aspect of themselves or use as a form of attack in battle. Most fights can get quite violent with some bloody scenes here and there. Problems with these fight sequences most noticable are the fact the characters involved talk too much. It can be interesting to learn how they pulled of a certain strategy, or what their attacks actually do to their opponents or surroundings. Another problem are the flashbacks, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense when characters are facing against an enemy. Yet another problem is the constant usage of the same move from time to time which did get rather boring as well. Most fights during the series are conflicts that take place during the storyline while others tend to show the characters skills off a little, such as the Chuunin exam, which they take to become middle rank ninja. The series may take its story arcs at a slow pace but it eventually concludes the first main part of the story in 135 episodes, while the rest are filler episodes, which can be watched optionally as, they don&rsquo;t develop the story any further. I never did watch them.\
Animation/Scenery\
Art and animation improve over time and also seem to be done differently at certain points in the series. Firstly the animation starts off quite dull in the beginning episodes but quickly picks up from there. Most simple actions are done in a simple manner, but most noticeable difference are during the fight sequences, which can take two different approaches towards them which I&rsquo;ll explain a little later. There are quite a lot of still shots throughout either type of scene to possibly lengthen the episodes on helping to drag the series on a little longer. There are a few moments where the animation can get awkward from time to time. Effects for the techniques and powers seem to have been done fairly well too.\
The two types of combat animation is best explained by using the words, slow and fast which now should be fairly obvious. During the slow combat situations, they contain a lot of talking and quick attacks or moves here and there being rather paced and tactical while the level of detail in each scene is still there. It is quite the opposite for the faster paced combat, more directed towards the physicals sides of fighting through punching and kicking. The scenes are much more quicker paced yet the level of detail is lower than normal for both the scenes and characters, yet more interactiveness to the environment around them.\
Character designs overall can have a similar look to each other resorting to uses of different facial or clothing accessories. However, they are quite unique and fairly recognisable between them, while remaining well drawn. The best noticeable ways of making some characters stand out are these examples; The head guard covering Kakashi&rsquo;s left eye, Lee&rsquo;s large eyes and fuzzy eyebrows, while being nicknamed by Naruto for having so and Shiino&rsquo;s sunglasses, with the top of his coat masking most of his face. Most of the lesser characters such as guards have a rather simple look between them. This also helps these characters stand out quite well from the rest making them interesting, especially once you learn more about them in the series.\
Art wise, the series uses a lot of soft, bright tones for the characters and objects while being slightly saturated looking for the scenery. During the first few episodes the art seemed quite dull, but again quickly improves like everything else, getting sharper and visually more appealing. The scenery is also made quite well using consistent blends of colour and schemes. The village of Konoha uses a lot of brighter colours such as reds and greens to detail the locations. While for the hidden village of sand uses many yellows and yellowish looking cream colours. The makes the locations also unique in appearance just like the characters. Fights take place in different types of locations instead of barren landscapes, and vary between them during the series such as woodlands, bridges and canopy of trees to name a few depending on the situation.\
Audio/Music\
There are quite a lot of sound effects and music that create a nice set and compile together pretty well during either of the scenes where used. The contact of thrown weapons on wood, flesh or material is used correctly as well as the other sounds being timed right, no major complaints in this area. These sounds eventually become much more common and easy to recognise after a several episodes or less. Music is a nice highlight to the series, quite unique in tune mixing a bit of modern or rock with old style or chants. Each track has its one touch, being used well throughout the series during the correct scenes. These also become common and quite enjoyable where I&rsquo;ve found myself tapping my feet to them as they start up. New tracks are introduced as the series progresses and some can make certain scenes much more exciting to watch, emotional of funnier depending on the scene again. Never had a problem with the voice actors, but found the mysterious or evil characters fit their role, being reflected towards the audience well.\
Conclusion\
An interesting series that isn&rsquo;t for everyone out there, which can be either liked or hated. Many characters and action sequences which are usually approached well although the series does tend ot drag on, while being combined with good sound and music throughout. Enjoyable watch putting the slow pace aside, yet an over rated series.\

    This is one of the most over rated animes ever, i may say that this review is abit biased seeing as ive watched only 2 episodes in a row, but through friends ive watched well over 30 of tid bits of episodes. But i remain uncertain of why this anime is so good. To me its only a good 'cartoon' not anime. For only non full anime fans watch this who don't know what a good anime REALY is. and comparing this to other animes its TERRIBLE. Nothing good can be said about naruto in my eyes. The japanes voices are so kiddy and terrible\
          \
        acting and little good for the bubs. The story jsut DRAGS N' DRAGS. Although the characters i can say some what of good about there 'coolitude' and the art is rather good. It's bright and creative and creates a somewhat decent atompshere in each scenerio.\
But this is not a good anime and i dont recomend watching it.\
if i was to recomend a good starter anime, I WOULD NVER SAY NARUTO.\
I would recomend either Gintama or Bleach. They both have a fantastic comeical side and serious fighting side.\
if u dont watch niether of them still avoid THIS RUBBISH and instead watch Inuyasha\
OR on a logn shot Yu-gi-oh\

 ______________________________________________________________\
Story: 9/10\
The only reason the story is only 9 is because of the stupid fillers from 140-220. If those weren't there this would definitely receive a 10. They aren't bad but sometimes it seems repetitive and you just want the story to move on. The story starts out with Naruto causing mischief again, but as the story progresses he becomes a little more mature. My favorite part of the\
          \
        story is how Naruto has to prove to society that he is capable of being hogake, the best ninja in the village.  \

Art: 10/10\
The art is great. The ninja moves they are all very detailed and has a good design. The character design is also very balanced.\
 ______________________________________________________________\
Sound: 10/10\
The background music(bgm) is just amazing. I mean seriously, they fit perfectly with the atmosphere and enhance the scene. The opening songs are great and my favorite one is the last one, \"Yura Yura\" by Hearts Grow. Its been almost a year since I first heard that song and I am still addicted to it. The ending songs are also good because of the slow emotional feeling.\
 ______________________________________________________________\
Character: 10/10\
It may not seem like a 10 in the beginning, but trust me after a while the characters get to be one of its best aspects. The three main characters all have different personalities and they change as the story goes. The supporting characters are great because they're not just forgotten about and actually play a part in the story.\
 ______________________________________________________________\
Enjoyment: 9/10\
It is a great anime for fans of martial arts and hand-to-hand combat. The reason that I enjoyed it was because the way Naruto never gives up was just inspiring to me.\
 ______________________________________________________________\
Overall: 9/10\
This will always be one of the best anime I have ever watched, and I highly recommend you to try it. By the way this is my first review, so tell me if it was helpful or not.\

    This review is from my personal assessment of episodes 1 to 135, inclusive, of the Naruto series.  I will try to do something interesting in this review, and that is to review the anime at the time it was aired and touch on its impact on me at the time it was aired.  If there were ever a series that had vastly extreme views, it would have to be this one.  And thus, this is why I had to review it, to contribute my thoughts into this sensitive subject.\
What is Naruto?  It is an action series that appeared out of nowhere\
          \
        that, in my opinion, along with Bleach, defined the action/adventure/drama genre.  By saying that a series defined a genre, it does not mean that series is the best from that genre.  It merely means that the series, at that time, came out and boosted the enjoyment and popularity of that genre, also becoming one of the most popular of that genre. That series will be compared to when people talk of the genre, and newer series of the same genre will aim to surpass it. That is, by my definition, what is means to define a genre.\
Story: 7/10\
From the moment it came out I was hooked. The story was catchy, and the action was already present in the first episode.  What really impressed me was the second episode, which introduced a very common sub-genre into the action genre, and that is comedy.  The pacing of the series was good, the suspense was there, the comedy was there, and there was this yearning to find out more about all the other ninjutsu and fighting styles that were also there.\
The plot, in itself, was pretty bad and didn't make a lot of sense to me.  Basically, each ninja is supposed to find 'their way of being a ninja' and by doing so, many of them broke the rules for being a ninja.  By being a ninja, one has to put their mission above all of their emotions, but the series is completely based on themes of loneliness, sadness, friendship, and all this stuff that's about emotions.  However, this was what I analyzed after looking back at the series.  Back then, the plot was good enough for me to keep my interest in it; therefore, I gave it an overall seven.\
Art: 8/10\
The action scenes are quite cool back then since it was really some of the most impressive action sequences that I have ever seen.  The art, not animation, was just mediocre.  Nothing really stands out, and while the ninjas 'teleporting' from place to place looks cool, it is really just easier to animate.  I will argue that the lack of artistic involvement does not affect my enjoyment of the series significant, and from a director's point of view, a long series such as this cannot afford to spent much more time on art.\
Sound: 10/10\
The background music was what blew me away.  Sometimes it is soothing and sad, other times it is cheery, and during action scenes, it is catchy and fun.  Without Naruto's famous background music scores, the quality of the series would really go down drastically, since hearing is one of the senses that is necessary to draw someone completely into a series.  Naruto did just that, so I will give Toshiro Masuda, the composer for the Naruto scores, my highest regards.\
Character: 7/10\
Looking at each character at a time, they all have great development.  Of course, everyone's favorite is Haku, and it is for a very good reason.  I still think that Haku's 'arc' is the best arc of Naruto, simply because of the huge amount of emotions that the arc conveys.  Naruto, Sasuke, and Gaara all have their own sad pasts, and it is common for the characters' actions to be driven by events that happened to them in the past.  This, in a sense, unifies the plot and shows mastery of character development.  After all, the past, present, and future plays a huge role of 'their way of ninja.'  There is one flaw when you look at the overall picture, however.  All of the main characters seem to suffer from the same sad and bitter past, which gets repetitive after a while.  \
Enjoyment: 10/10\
After all of this criticism, I just plainly and inexplicably enjoyed the series.  Naruto is one series where equations don't work out and analyses fail.  I can find so many flaws about it, but yet, it is just so damn enjoyable.  There were many memorable scenes, such as Haku's loyalty and Sakura's feelings.  Anime can be watched, enjoyed, and tossed away, but the ones that create vivid memories are the ones that you enjoy the most.\
Overall: 7/10\
Remember that I am only reviewing this anime up to episode 135, so fillers are not included. I personally think that the fillers ruined the anime, and they were such a drastic failure that we forgot about the time when Naruto was enjoyable.  Yes, I think that Naruto is just a mediocre series now and not as good as it used to be.  However, I will never forget the amount of enjoyment this series have given me, and I will give it a fair rating on how much it meant to me.  Naruto was part of my early anime experience, and it was one of the reasons why I am such an anime fan today.  I owe a lot to this series, and even though it might not be great now, it is a series I will always remember.\

    I forced my way though around 43 episodes before dropping this, so you can't tell me I don't know what I'm talking about. This has to be one the worst animes ever made. I'd recommend Mars of Destruction before this. Naruto seemed to have potential at a first go, oh maybe it's going somewhere! Then it doesn't. So much for the plot. The art, is decent. Not really good enough to wow me.  The sound was decent as well, but nothing worth talking about. The characters are awful, with no depth to them at all. If you are going to drop it for anything,\
          \
        it's going to be the shallow characters. Overall I didn't enjoy this. Nor should anyone watch this anime, ever. Go watch something good, like FMA or GTO.\

    Alright, so let me start off by saying, boy, was I a non-believer of Naruto! I remember watching it on YTV when I was like 12 or 13, and the only thing I remember was hating it. I even remember making fun of Narutards, but now, about 4-5 years later, am a Narutard myself. xD So I just want to say that if something's holding you back, ignore it and try it out! A good handful of episodes (20-30) should get you hooked on! After both Naruto and Naruto: Shippudden, I can confidently say that this is one of the best anime I've watched so\
          \
        far so I strongly recommend anyone to watch this series regardless of the genre you're interested in! \
So, let's get down to businessss:\
Sound: 10/10\
Naruto had one of the greatest soundtracks in all of anime (right behind Inuyasha that is!). I have felt all the emotions a human can possibly feel through the music itself. The fierce beating of the drums during the fights, soothing sound of the flute as Naruto reminisces about the past, upbeat instrumental as Pervy Sage sneaks a peek at the sexy ladies were a few of the many soundtracks that had me at the edge of my chair, crying, or at other times laughing 'till I fell off my chair! The sound in Naruto I found to be impeccable, and flawless, especially the OST.\
Art:  8/10 \
The art was good. Not amazing, I wouldn't say. But still pretty good. But if you're dissatisfied that there aren't that many hot guys ;) or girls, just wait 'till Shippudden! (Not to mention, another huge plus point is the yaoi/yuri fan-drawings you get to enjoy on DeviantArt or ZeroChan! ;) hehehe) But aside from the character drawings (which is still great!), the scenery were outstanding! My favourite colour is green, so I found the lush forests, and the soft paddy fields to be just absolutely breath-taking! The scenery really makes you want to live life in the edo period because it gives off the feeling that life is so relaxing!  \
Story: 7.5/10\
The story has a lot of potential (as you will see in Naruto: Shippudden), but unfortunately, there are a little too many filler episodes! But don't be discouraged because once you get addicted, you wouldn't care about the filler because the original plot is just too exciting! Besides, you can always skip the filler (search Google!). When you think it can't get any better, Naruto: Shippudden just surprises you with the improved pace! So, like I said, don't be discouraged if you think the pacing in Naruto is too slow and the plot isn't progressing, because in the next sequel, it really picks up! But apart from the warnings and \"bad things\", Naruto is a lot about friendship, and how they live life and fight against evil all while they stand beside their comrades. One thing for sure in Naruto, you know they've got each others' backs. Pardon the cheesyness but that's the main reason I like it so much! :3 \
Character: 9/10\
The characters are really easy to love! And it's just amazing when they fight together to fight evilll. (haha, there it is again, the cheesyness within me). It's so easy to laugh along with, fall in love with (sasori x deidara ;)), and just admire these characters! \
Enjoyment: 9/10\
I never thought after completing Avatar the Last Airbender that I'd fall in love with a show again, but here it is, Naruto! I really enjoyed it! Throughout the whole time I was experiencing so many emotions - anger, happiness, fear, jealousy (Sasori! ;)), and depression. Naruto's up there on my list ;) (though Shippudden's higher ;D)\
Overall: 8.5/10\
Overall, it was a really enjoyable show and I'd recommend it to anyone especially if you'd like a series where you can get attached to the characters (a longer one rather than the short 12 or 26 episodic animes). Hope you enjoy it as much as I do and send me a message if you decide to try it out and how it goes with you! ;)\
For now, I shall bid you adieu and get on to One Piece (hehe, my new addiction...)\

    I have not done a review in awhile and the reason for doing a review on such a popular anime is that I've checked a lot of random peoples profile to get anime inspiration as well as to compare and only about 40% had seen Naruto!!! This is not including those that dropped it or put it on hold etc. but how does one not attempt to watch it?! Obv. it is not for all people but here's my review anyway.\
Story- It's your classic underdog story that a lot of people can relate with. Let's face it, people in America can be very cruel to\
          \
        others that openly express their love for anything unorthodox. This is a anime full of struggle and perseverance, the message is so clear and motivating it's just as motivating after watching one of the Rocky movies (If for some reason you don't like Rocky make another analogy for something that pumps you up and it's equivalent to Naruto). The comedy is pretty good and they do not repeat the same jokes so that is a blessing. Why wasn't this a 10? Well I will tell you that the huge problem with this and its sequel is the damn FILLER! The filler is pretty awful not gonna lie. Trust me when I say do not quit the show because of it; worst comes to worst google where the filler ends and start from that ep. and skip all the filler; it's more enjoyable that way.\
Art- The art is good, not great. The fights, characters, justu and all the other effects look cool but in the original Naruto it's much less crisp. The colors are not as powerful as they could be and maybe it gives it a cool vintage feel but this is all about preference.\
Sound- This deserves a freakin 10! The soundtrack is easily something you can download to your i-pod it's so catchy. Every opening is great. I do not know why but I really do not listen to a lot of enjoyable ending songs, honestly I can think out of all the anime I have seen I only enjoy 4 ending songs. This show doesn't have great endings. That is not why I did not rate it  a 10; it is because of the Dub. I have seen this show with both languages and lemme tell ya, the Dub gets very obnoxious. Sub is the way to go.\
Character- This show has more development than a teenager. Important people can die remember that it is not all sunshine and rainbows. The heroes you will love and the villains are beyond dark and evil and you will love to hate them. Enough said...   \
Overall a nostalgic, easily rewatchable funny action packed anime. If you haven't seen it please do yourself a favor and watch it. Skip the filler and enjoy the fun ride Naruto will take you on. And.... it is part of the current big 3 if you count Naruto and Shippuden the same show as I do... just saying... \

    Many people out there love Naruto and I can see why. The characters are compelling, varied and interesting and the storytelling has many parts that are likable. But there are three big problems that drags everything down. Here they are.\
1: No-one ever changes\
This is mostly true for Naruto, but also for other characters and situations. It seems that the more important the character is, the less the character develops. The only development you see is an increase in abilities and power, but with such a cast of characters so much more could have been done. Thusly, Naruto is a show of wasted opportunities and weak\
          \
        character development.\
2: Very slow pace\
There are large parts of the show where the last part of the previous episode makes up the first part of the following! Seriously! This means that during that time you will LITERALLY not miss a single frame of animation if you skip every second episode. Also, some battles are so drawn out that you almost expect the participants to drop dead from old age, or at least hunger. Picking up the pace at most places would have helped the show immensely.\
3: Fillers\
The dreaded fillers, episodes that do not follow the main storyline but show adventures apart from it. They have been handled well in many shows, but in Naruto it seems that almost every filler was written by someone who doesn't like writing stories. There are a few gems to be had, but for the most part they're boring and irrelevant. Fillers can help develop the characters, but this just doesn't happen in Naruto.\
In conclusion, Naruto can be very good and very enjoyable at times, but finding those gems means watching a whole lot of boring and repetitive stuff. A shortened version with only the good parts included would make it a much better series.\

Firstly story is awesome but has some minor setback & those to due to some more than needed fillers , but anyway i being a really big fan of ninjas like it very much , Don't think too much & just go for it , those who do think too much of the story just end up finding flows , i can find major flaws in series like FMA also but then again i just accept the series for it offers\
One thing i like is , unlike One Piece Naruto has properly divided the story in intervals , so you may expect any big\
          \
        saga to last a proper 30-40 episodes max , whereas in one piece i used to get bored with each saga lasting 60+ episodes that was too annoying\

It is definitely great but the characters could have been made too look like real ninjas , i somehow don't like that characters don't cover up their faces with masks , this is rather related to drawing ut anyway since there isn't a drawing rating thing i am writing this here , apart from that the animation in fight scenes is especially awesome with all the chakara effects , in chidori & rasengan\
\
Sound >>>\
Well the flute sound effects are just too awesome & it's been 3 years now since i started watching naruto & still the flute sound effects for the good guy characters are way too awesome than any soundtrack i ever heard\
\
Characters >>>\
Now you will be annoyed by some of the young characters but it overall i feel please use the japanese voice , as i feel VIZ Have not done justice to the character of naruto , because of his screeching voice , the fat chick that did his dubbing should be fired , i like the English dub apart from that & yeah you will be more attached to the characters as the story progresses , if you don''t believe me , i guarantee that those of you who look for emotions in anime will like Chouji once you see episodes from 130 - 135 , other characters also grow on you once the series progresses , one thing i would like too point out is i hate Alphonse elric from fma coz he is too annoying with his goody goody attitude in even the darkest situation like not killing homonculus even if they are killing people elrics love , but in naruto i did not find any character who does not understand the situation & act totally different in a irritating manner , so yeah characters are really good\
\
I Personally like characters who i can idolize & who encourage me , as these are the people who can do no wrong & so i like to look up to them instead of real life people who have some dirt on them always , with that said Naruto is the perfect person to look up to as a role model especially when he grows up in shippuden , but that is a different tale\
\
Enjoyment >>>\
It is a perfect blend of action , comedy & knows when to relieve you from all the action & knows how to boost your excitement with memorable fights , so be sure that when you watch this anime you will never regret viewing it",

    Naruto isn't an anime that all poeple might like. in fact the people who hate naruto like bleach. for me, it is the opposite. \
naruto's story is very good, and the supernatural power of ninja in it has its own taste. the music also really helped especially in the fighting scenes (the music composer is toshiro masuda).\
all types of chatacters are included in this show, for a fighting show, i strongly recommend anyone one to watch it. \
the filler part might be boring bcoz it repeats the same thing all over. but the story of this part ends at epi 136 if im not mistaking.\
Naruto\
          \
        shippuuden is also out and it has a different plot somehow but it is not bad, the story is getting better tho. The manga is ON FIRE. \
It's really recommended to watch naruto, especially that its mangaka ( kishimoto masashi ) didn't make other mangas or animes than naruto! \

Naruto was my second Anime and I liked it :) .. Of course the filler have really sucked, but the first 135 Episodes were really good ..\
especially the animation in fights were awesome and the fighting-system is well through-thought.. However  i am looking forward to Shippuuden and I hope Ill enjoy this as much as I have enjoyed the first 135 Eps of Naruto ;) ..\

    Well the more experienced anime viewers are going to give reviews of probly 5 and lower while the beginers are going to say it was outstanding and naruto is just one of those animes where you hate it or love it. Naruto is a big anime for kids and alot of anime biginers watch this anime because its so huge in the anime world that they think why not? so i am going to give this review all ive got.\
~Story~\
 Well what can you say The plot is accually pretty fair and original on the basis of ninjas hokage ect. but i think it dragged\
          \
        on far too long with hundreds of episodes and its still not over its alot like one piece and bleach in that it just wont seem to end the start of naruto is great untill you get about half through the original series and it just gets boring and pointless and then with shippuden it goes good and then bad again but we will stick to the original naruto. I found that the series is alot of fillers and no real plot line other than alot of ahem sakura screaming sasuke but thats not really the point lol. \
~Characters~\
One word: Dull.....The characters grow sure but they dont really seem to well its hard to explain ill say it an easier way. The characters are idiots because all they focase on is find sasuke oh he killed aton of people oh well lets find him anyway its like a huge game of tag in this anime they chase sasuke he chases them over and over again its dull and boring.\
~Overall~\
 To new people to anime watch this but to experienced people in the anime community dont bother you wont be missing much other than alot of screaming. =\\ 5/10\

    The anime series goes well with the manga (sort of) there are of filters that can confused those who never read the manga on what's going on. The whole show is great especially for kids ranged 10+ up  and it sets out the whole 'never give up on your dreams' attitude there are some humor around it sometimes, but it still forced striaght to the main part of the story. Whatever you liked reading it, watch the anime version from Viz or in it's original dub it's still a good show to watch. Although I quite suggest not to watch the filter arc when\
          \
        toonami shows them. I could even recommend this to any shonen beginners because of the story artwork and good fight scenes (ones that do not inclued Sakura because she's weak).\

Fictional feudal-style Japan, where the Ninjas roam wearing cool SWAT costumes. Besides that, they also have Dragon Ball style \"chi\".\
Character:\
There's only 3 characters you need to know:\
Naruto - The main character (hence the anime title) who is a mediocre ninja if not for the hidden demon inside him.\
Sakura - A useless girl who serves no purpose in this anime, a liability who always got in the way of other people.\
Sasuke - An emo boy who thinks he's the center of the world.\
Relationships:\
Naruto has a crush on Sakura because he thinks she's cute, even though she's a b*tch to him.\
Sakura is obsessed on Sasuke because she\
          \
        likes the typical bad boy type.\
Sasuke thinks Naruto is his rival and get pissed when Naruto is stronger than him. But actually Sasuke is just confused by his love for Naruto.\
Plot:\
Fight, fight, fight, training. Fight, fight fight, training. Fight, fight, fight. \

    Story- Well if you haven't already seen at least an episode or two of this show online,on tv,or you live in a box then let me give you a little bit of the main story to this great anime. In the beggining the show starts of with a sort of flashback of the ninja leaf village. You see that there is a terrible demon that is attacking the village. The narrator will go on to tell you that the hokage of the village sealed the spirit of the fox demon in a little boy, and this boy is Naruto. After that it will start in\
          \
        the modern time of the story. Naruto will go on to make many friends in the ninja academy and go on many adventure through out this anime as this show is a 220 episode series with many story arcs. From episode 135 to 220 though there are filler episodes(episodes that are not original to the manga) created because the author could not start on working on the next story of this show because the anime episodes were catching up to the releases of the manga. Anyway you will notice as the story goes on the development of the characters and their maturity.\
Characters-\
Naruto- He's a imature at the beggining but becomes more serious when his friends or comrades are in danger.\
Sasuke- His style is to be considered as emo due to him being in an almost always depressed laid back sort of mood. (Will you learn more about later in the series about his family etc.)\
Sakura- She's kind of annoying to most people that watch this show because of her weakness in the beggining of the show and her complaining and competiveness to win Sasukes heart.\
Kakashi- A very quiet teacher to the squad but you will learn more about his background in the series. He's very strong and protective though.\
Animation Quality- The animation quality of this show is not very high mainly for the reason being that this is quite a long show and was aired weekly.\
Pros-  This anime has a very addictive story line and characters as well as good morals at times. The fighting is pretty good and is overall a very entertaining anime. It also has some funny humor at times.\
Cons- This anime does not have the best animation quality and the story line is a little predictable at times. But you do have to remember that this is an anime more for a younger audience.",

    For some reason, every single review I read on MAL  looks like they were typed by a person who is about 12 years old, but trying to seem like they are a seasoned writer. I won't be doing that. This is my honest opinion with no attempt to razzle and dazzle you. (Though, I may not be able to help it, as my writing tends to be on the more \"professional\" side because of my profession lol). \
Anyways! If you haven't watched Naruto yet, GET ON IT.\
Why should you watch it? I'll tell you why: it's incredible. I am a normal adult male. I\
          \
        am not a self-described \"anime freak,\" though I thoroughly enjoy a ton of anime. This show doesn't feel like your typical anime. This is a show that everybody can enjoy. You get to see the life and progression of a little jackass in a village full of serious ninjas and over time, you begin to see a bit of yourself in Naruto. (At least, I did. I was just like him. Lashing out, being mean to people, and all the while hurting on the inside). But, there is so much more to it. Naruto starts out as a show about this kid that nobody likes but when the show progresses, you learn so much about him. You learn why he acts the way he does and you begin to feel for him. You want to reach out and tell him \"everything will be ok.\" However, there is no need for that. The sheer optimism of this kid fills you up with hope and joy. By the end of the series, he had fulfilled his goal to become Hokage and he is one of, if not THE, strongest ninja in the world.  When its over, you realize, I have grown up with this kid. It makes you think why you aren't doing better in your own life. Believe it, achieve it. Signing off folks. \

    This anime....well it is something else. I enjoyed watching every episode. The music was so upbeat and keeps an audience hooked. Every episode, I was either on the edge of my seat in suspense, or I was on the floor laughing. This anime incoorporates humor and all seriousness in one. This is definaltly an anime that I will remember forever. \
The characters are very different and the viewers can find a way to relate to at least one of them. (Sasuke and I for example.) \
The plot is very well thought out. The only thing that I hated about this anime was the fillers. They\
          \
        didn't need to add them. It ruined the plot. And it was going so well...\
I seriously recommend this for anyone who is into suspense, action, doesn't mind a little blood, drama, romance (a little..) and comedy. Naruto has all of those components to be one of the greats that will always be remembered when the fandom dies down. \

    I love Naruto for being funny, inspirational, action packed, and tragic at the same time. Each story arc protrays different characters, with tragic pasts and how their lives change. Overall storyline itself is fantabulous. Character developement is also awesome. To be honest, one of the characters has helped me understand myself littel better now. Some of the themes (Orochimaru's theme, etc) are awesome and the art is good too. Since it is shounen, so you also have lot of action, which is top notch as well. The only disappointing aspects of the series might be its' speed at which it covers the manga and the\
          \
        fillers. But if you only watch anime and love action packed. comedy anime, you better give this a try. Just avoid the fillers like I did and enjoy the show.\

    Story:The first main story arc is one of the best through the series and the rest until  the last real story arc are decent. But then probably one of the stupidest thing happened in history. Instead of continuing the real story for a year and half they made filler. Bad filler, filler that makes you question wither your time should be waisted with this. And a lot of people though that it was a waist of there time and stopped watching. That is why I gave it a 5. If they didnt give it the most amount of filler ever it would have been\
          \
        a 8.\
Animation: pretty good, nothing note worthy.\
Sound: enjoyable nothing special.\
Character: Well lets just say this. Naruto is a pretty lame character. He is lame and will always be lame. (he is super lame in the fillers, I think I saw him use one move in all the episodes I saw) But the saving grace is the side characters. Great I wish that some of the side characters were the main hero instead of Naruto.\
Enjoyment: Up the the part where the real last story arc ends, pretty good 8\
but then the filler hits that got it a 5.\

    Style - It's ok. Some parts (e.g Lee vs Gaara fight) are decent, other parts are not so great. 2 out of 3. \
Character - The main flaw with Naruto characters is that they are clinically retarded. Ninjas are supposed to be stealthy, right? There wasn't a single stealthy ninja in the whole of naruto. Naruto wears a orange jumpsuit, Sakura wears red, Sasuke wears blue, the Akatsuki wear black cloaks with red clouds and everyone wears a shiny light-reflecting \"forehead protector\". Sure is stealthy. You see, normal people tend to avoid fighting for no good reason as it means getting hurt, noticed, and arrested.\
          \
        Naruto characters on the other hand start fights for no reason at all other than to bolster their incredibly fragile egos. Naruto is an impulsive idiot. Sasuke is an arrogant asshole. Sakura is useless. In addition, all of the characters are immature, naive, and lazy. Oh yeah, did I mention the fact that Naruto charges headlong into every fight, breaking formation and getting his ass kicked, every single time? He must have brain damage from getting beaten up so often. 0 out of 4. \
Story - The story of Naruto is complete nonsense. Throwing knives are crap as ranged weapons. It'd be easier to just sneak up on someone and stab them with it. Why does nobody use a bow and arrow in Naruto? They already have computer screens. The original Eastern concept of chakra was taken by Naruto and made into magic points that allow you to break the laws of physics. Naruto originally wanted to be a hokage. Now he's more interested in retrieving Sasuke. Okay let's go through the plot. First there was the Zabuza mission, where I thought they should have died. Zabuza alone could have taken all of them out but he wasted too much time chatting around. Then there's Haku, who was about to kill both Naruto and Sasuke when suddenly Naruto's 9-tailed fox guardian came out of nowhere and saved the day. This then happens every single time Naruto is in trouble - the 9 tailed fox saves the day. It gets repetitive and sends all the wrong messages to the kids (no hard work needed, just call the 9 tailed fox!!). Also, how Naruto defeated Kiba in the preliminary exam was just incredibly stupid, needless to say shitting your pants wouldn't save you from someone determined to beat the shit out of you in real life. Oh yeah and Naruto gives speeches that instantly turns villains into good guys. 0 out of 3. \
Overall 2 out of 10 for retarded characters and nonsensical plot. \

    For some reason loads of people like this anime, I really do not get that. I watched the show until a certain villain (do not want to spoil it for others, just because I am civil) died, because the villain was the most interesting character. I mean:\
Naruto.\
Uninteresting character with the\"a super powerful creature is inside you\" cliche (seen it in yu yu hakusho, bleach ans a ton of other shows). What does he want to be? A ninja... That is the begin motivation and then I wonder \"how do I connect to this character?\". Then the failed attempts to make him funny make him annoying,\
          \
        his power is not that interesting and then I did some research and it will only become worse.\
Sakura.\
What is there to say about her? did she do anything in the first 2 seasons? well... she jumped before an old man to protect him with a kunai... and failed to do so. And that is all my faulty memory remembers about her.\
Sasuke.\
Somehow he is the beef cake bad boy personage, that got girls in real life swooning over him, I really do not get you people... He is bland and monotone, but hey at least he does things!\
Fights.\
Nothing that we have not seen being done better in older anime (yu yu hakusho for example, hell even dragonball and flame of recca were better in fight scenes). Big weapons are being used (what use is a shurken if it is foldable and has a diameter of one meter?) mostly and when they use their kunai their utterly useless. Then they use their ninja magic to fight, sasuke mostly breathes fire, naruto copies himself and sakura does nothing.\
No real tension in this anime from what I have seen and does not really motivates me to look further (and I watched some horrible anime, willingly (though they're not on my list because they are quite obscure and I forgot their names...)).\
Premise.\
Ninja ninja ninja ninja, ninja ninja, believe it! Even though they are not ninja's since they do not use any stealth, I can forgive them calling themselves ninja's, the problem is that they keep putting attention to it! WE GET IT YOU ARE A NINJA AND NO I WILL NOT BELIEVE IT! STOP SAYING THAT! And Naruto has some kind of 9 tailed rabbit thing that says it is a fox sealed inside him for a reason and there are people with very unusual weapons that would not be that good in our world, but hey suspension of disbelieve, eh?\
Overall.\
Not a pleasant anime and I find it a wonder that the show lasted this long in manga form...\

    First of all, why did most people here think that naruto was a good enough show to get at least a 7? Sorry if I am going against your opinion but I personally found this show alright.\
1.) The story.\
At the start, naruto started off slow and I found it boring for a while until it got into it more. For that reason, I am rating the story a 6/10.\
2.) Art\
The art style doesn't really matter to me in an anime but I will rate it anyway. Considering that naruto was first aired in 2002, it was expected that the art style wouldn't be as beautiful\
          \
        as some other anime's today. Knowing that I rate the art style a 6/10\
3.sound\
The sound in the anime was good enough for me to at least enjoy it slightly. I will rate the sound 5/10\
4.) Character.\
Now, this is the best thing about naruto, the characters. I found out that in the end, I got attached to some characters and wanted to see more. My favourite character would most likely be Kakashi for no reason whatsoever. I will rate the characters a 7/10.\
5.) Enjoyment\
This anime was enough to make me watch all of it without sleeping my way through it. It may be slow but some scenes were enough to make me hype for the next one. I rate the enjoyment a 5/10\
6.)Overall\
I rate this show a 5/10 overall.\

    **Has Been Re-Edited, Watched as of Episode 62**\
Story - 5.6/10 (F+)\
What story? Oh the Ninja boy wants to be the best. Where have i heard this from before? Like countless other shounen shows. But only Naruto has the balls to actually bore us with pointless slapstick comedy and 3-4 episode long fights that hardly resolve anything except more questions. Naruto is like a trainwreck, it's so bad yet you still watch it to laugh at it. \
Animation - 5.0/10 (F)\
Aside from the whole 'Sexy Ninjitsu' thing, all of it rarely ever changes. It feels so old and worn out, nothing else catches my eyes.\
Sound: -\
          \
        7.8/10 (C+)\
This is where i change my tone for the most part. I can honestly say i like every single opening of Naruto, it fits the mood for the first 1:30 of the show, then the other 21 minutes is just horrible. The soundtrack is alright, but just that.\
Character: - 4.8/10 (F)\
We have: Naruto, our favorite ramen-loving, orange jumpsuit ninja. Ok? We mostly have the same old characters until we get Jiraya and Orochimaru and Itachi. Even with them, it still feels so old and dead by now, that's where i stopped watching it.\
Enjoyment: - 8.0/10 (B)\
So why the hell did i enjoy it? Well, it seems that EVERY SINGLE EPISODE, Naruto screws up. That there is enjoyment. Whether it's an assault by Sakura, or just plain screw up, i love it (it's supposed to be a bad thing, by the way.). I can watch the filler episodes and just laugh so damn hard at Naruto failing.\
Overall (Averaged, thank the Enjoyment rating.. :) ): - 5.8/10 (F)\
If you're a basement-dwelling, friendless moron than this show is for you! If you love anime, has tons of friends, and does well in school, THIS SHOW IS NOT FOR YOU.\

    Erm. Yes, I'm advocating for the positive side of Naruto... Just don't shoot the messenger :P\
Currently, there are 26 reviews written for Naruto, out of which roughly more than half advocate that Naruto sucks, is not worth watching, and is simply overrated. \
Right. So we know that the fillers are horrible, the plot's 'typically shounen' and Sakura never does a single thing. But why exactly has Naruto become so popular? What makes it tick? What keeps reeling in the dough for Kishimoto?\
There are a variety of reasons.\
Naruto is the very embodiment of the shounen psyche. It deals with some common fundamental themes that appeal to\
          \
        the audience. Valuing your friends, never giving up, and challenging the status quo are just a couple messages conveyed by Naruto's plight. And we, the viewers, can relate to those themes. Supposedly.\
Then of course, are the insane battle scenes. True, some battles are incapable of suspending disbelief, as you think 'that's doesn't make sense.' Then there are the parts where someone has to explain every move he makes. However, overall, the animation, the music, and the 'situation' all add up into something that excites and awakens the ninja within us. (Wow, that was corny)\
There's also a fair bit of humor involved. Most of it is slapstick comedy, such as the teasing born from the Naruto-Sasuke rivalry, while other comic scenes truly manage to touch the humerus (episode 101, anyone?). However, some of the older viewers are nonplussed by many scenes which simply come across as stupid and juvenile. Though i'm sure Kishimoto knew crass humor is a double edged sword at times.\
Finally, Naruto is often geared towards younger viewers. Yes, those little midgets everyone ignores on internet forums and discussion boards (lovingly referred to as 'Narutards') are probably the greatest reason why Naruto has gained such popularity.\
This review was hastily manufactured at 3:12am.\
Please excuse any lapses in grammar, spelling, and sanity I may have had in writing this review.\

    the modern day prototypical shonen anime, it exemplifies what shonen is all about with a young hero and his friends, including lots of action and humor. I really enjoyed watching this, I gave it an 8 for story when it actually was sticking to the main story line, I didn't count the filler episodes, which i admit make up pretty much the second half of the entire series, but even the fillers brought some good chuckles for me, and a couple of action gems.

        steps up. The sound or music I assume was pretty good, and the OP and ED of the anime were fun to listen to, especially Haruka Kanata (OP2).

Naruto is a bit of a paradox in anime. It's pretty rare for a series to be as consistently bashed by experienced anime viewers. However, I doubt that there is another series that has been more commercially successful internationally and has helped grow anime viewership in the west than Naruto. Despite the hatred it receives from the astute critics and connoisseurs of anime, even the majority of today's anime elitists in the west are probably anime fans as a direct or indirect result of this show's influence\
          \
        whether they admit it or not. Further, it still has among the largest and most dedicated fanbases out there. In that sense, it's like the Metallica of anime; hated by the die-hard fans, but extremely commercially popular and the reason most metal fans are metal fans in the first place.\
Naruto is set in a universe in which Ninja possess mystical and spiritual powers. It is set primarily in Konoha, or the Hidden Leaf Village, and follows the life of Naruto, a young Leaf Shinobi who is hated by the entire village as he is the vessel for a spiritual monster who once attacked the village, as he seeks to overcome his low social position in the village and turn into an elite ninja, in fact the leader of his village. The plot also focuses on Sasuke, Naruto's best friend and rival, who comes from a prominent family in the village that was killed off by his brother, is widely perceived as the best and most popular student, who seeks revenge on his brother for murdering his clan and (minor spoiler) turns towards the dark side as he seeks his revenge.\
Right off the bat, you see the potential for an extremely good plot. We have a bildungsroman in Naruto about overcoming one's social position and starting point in life through free will and hard work, essentially avoiding Sartrean bad faith if you will. Sasuke is used as a foil to Naruto, starting from the opposite position yet is eaten up by hatred and need for revenge. All this set in a compelling universe drawing richly off of Japanese history and mythology with a very large cast of likeable characters.\
At least, that's what Naruto could have been. Unfortunately, the great potential for this show's concept is absolutely wasted with poor execution and we are beaten over the head that accomplishes almost nothing thematically or narratively in 220 episodes. Instead of the plot I laid out above, Naruto's main conflict is resolved, or perhaps more accurately dissolved, in the first couple dozen episodes as he's pretty quickly accepted by those around him.  Naruto's motivation then becomes becoming stronger because...well, no reason. Instead, all we get is continuous cliche shounen dialogue from Naruto (and almost every other character, for that matter) about how he must \"work hard and become stronger\" at almost every moment where the show tries (and ultimately fails) to conjure up some meaning and emotion. Naruto’s motivations become almost exactly what was being satarized in the film Rubber: “no reason.” Rather than relating Sasuke's plot to Naruto's main struggle, Sasuke's plight (which, in many ways, is extremely superior to Naruto's) becomes a sort of side plot to Naruto's training.\
That said, there are certainly some moments where Naruto lives up to its potential. For example, the climax of the Konoha Crush, particularly the development of Gaara's character, was fairly well done, if dragged out far too long. And the Sasuke Chase arc, particularly the climax battle just before the filler arc, was riveting and developed each of the major characters fairly well. However, just after Sasuke's plot climaxes--the show just completely drops any semblance of plot. For almost 100 episodes, there is absolutely no development (with the possible exception of Gaara in the last serial \"Village of Artisans\") on any of the threads developed in the first half of the show, it is literally all filler. Normally, I'm quite a fan of shows with a ton of \"filler\" as it provides room for deeper character development, the introduction of minor characters who may play a role later, an opportunity to develop an aesthetic atmosphere, and a better emotional connection between viewers and characters. Examples of this done very well is the early bits of Fullmetal Alchemist, most of Samuari Champloo, and some of the middle parts of Monster. However, Naruto accomplishes almost none of this in the infamous \"filler arc.\"  With few exceptions, almost none of the already lackluster characters are developed further. Far too much time is spent on developing the backstories of side characters who have absolutely no connection to the main plot or, worse yet, on childish comic relief episodes that contribute absolutely nothing at all to the show, and in fact detract from it because they're not only a waste of time but mostly horribly unfunny.\
Speaking of lackluster characters, Naruto falls apart in this department. For a plot that tries to be a bildungsroman, Naruto himself is absolutely static, flat, one-dimensional, and is perhaps the worst character in the entire series. Almost every character is identical thematically; they have experienced some major loss of a loved one in the past that is explained far too slowly in a series of long-wound out flashbacks or far too quickly through contrived dialogue in the middle of battle (because when one is fighting, it's obvious that everyone tells their entire life story), and all their motivations and behaviors are completely traced back to this one incident. Almost every major character is a clone of Naruto in terms of motivation, just wanting to be the \"strongest\" for no apparent reason. Additionally, almost every major character is just a cliche copy of your typical Shounen stock characters. Finally, the antagonists--especially the main antagonist, Shikamaru--are simply awful; their motivations are either explained by a backstory that is identical to every other, or not explained at all.\
There are three main exceptions, Gaara, Sasuke, and Neji. Let me explain why, though I might have some minor, vague spoilers in my justification. Those characters are all fairly dynamic, thematically engaging, and have motivations that actually have something to do with their backstories beyond \"I just lost someone I love.\" In Gaara's case, we find someone who learns human empathy and acts (or at least would act if they did a better job with Naruto) as a foil to Naruto's demon within in connection to a back story in which his concept of human empathy is destroyed by the blind hatred and loss of the person he loves the most. In Neji's case, we see someone who learns the value of free will in connection to his backstory revolving around his place in a rigid social hierarchy, with also somewhat of a foil to Naruto. And in Sasuke's case, a character who slowly turns darker and darker in his quest for revenge (although, as I mentioned, his characterization is ultimately dropped and left incomplete), though despite his prominence in the main plot is far too thematically disconnected from Naruto. Those three characters have really good depth and showcase the best of what Naruto has to offer. There’s also one minor exception: Menma, who is arguably the best character in the entire series, a character who has an entirely different type of backstory and who appears only in three episodes at the very end of the series, but I will not explain more in the interest of avoiding spoilers.\
Despite how poorly the characters are written, for some reason almost all of the major cast is very likable and addicting to watch. Even though the characters are poor in a literary sense, there is some reason I just can't quite explain why I can't completely dismiss Naruto's characters. There's a sense in which one has a sense of nostalgia for characters like Shikamaru, Hinata, Shino, and Rock Lee when they aren't on screen, even if they aren't the best-written characters. Maybe it's in the way their movements are animated, or the fact that they are just similar enough that they remind you of better-written characters in other animes in subtle ways without being too cliche, or maybe because they do have fairly entertaining personalities and various idiosyncrasies. However, even the poorly written characters add to the enjoyability of the series.\
Arguably other than the poorly executed and clunkily prolongated plot, the art is the worst feature of this anime. I do not mean necessarily the animation, though I will have more to say about this below, I am talking about the filmography: directing style, dialogue, camera angles, and other artistic decisions that can often make or break a series. Even though the plot is so poorly executed and I've given it a lower score than the art (I consider filmography a part of the art score even though most people think art refers primarily to animation, I think MAL should have a directing score), I would venture to say that the filmography is the thing that primarily destroys Naruto's quality. It features all the standard tropes of mediocre Shounen anime that makes mediocre Shounens, well, mediocre: long-drawn out battles that are so slowly progressed they're tedious; unrealistic dialogue in the middle of fighting; poor, childish attempts at comedy thrown in at the worst times; repetitious jokes that became unfunny about the third time they were told (we get it, Jariaya’s a pervert, Koji is fat, and Kakashi likes romance novels); cliche camera angles like zooming in on a character’s eye randomly during an emotional moment, zooming in on the face during a thought/aside, or doing an angled pan shot over a battle scene during an unnecessary bit of dialogue; and extremely long flashbacks either to another identical tragic backstory to a trivial character or to events that literally happened two or three episodes ago.\
Speaking of dialogue, Naruto is almost laughably bad in this respect. If you hate your liver, take a shot every time some character's only line is the name of another character for no good reason, or every time someone says some variation of \"I'll train harder\"/\"I need to become stronger;\" or anytime someone screams out the name of whatever fighting move they're using, or every time there's some variation of \"I'm going to beat you\"/\"I'm gonna bring you down\"/\"There's no way you can beat me\"/another similar cliche line that a dumb jock would utter during a sporting event. But the worst aspect of dialogue, which is more generally a problem in most shounen anime, is the way every single battle tactic is spoon-fed to the viewer through unrealistic dialogue thrown in the middle of a battle, the same way that every character's motivation is completely spoon-fed to the viewer--down to the point that if there's any tension in relationship to a character, five minutes are wasted on a flashback to scenes we've already seen before. I would expect a show about ninja to convey an atmosphere of mystery; but instead, you're continually patronized by contrived, spoon-fed explanations and dialogue.\
Despite my problems with the filmography and writing, the reason why I still don't think the art deserves a lower score is because the animation is not all bad. There are a couple slipshod moments early on in the series, and it's certainly nothing to write home about, but it's far from the worst animation I've seen. I'm generally not a fan of Studio Pierrot's style (see how they ruined the second season of Legend of Korra), but something about it is fitting for Naruto's atmosphere.\
The sound is also adequate in Naruto. The Japanese cast is mostly fairly good, though a few of them sound somewhat cliche. I'm ashamed to admit I watched most of this show in the English dub (simply because it's so long and I wanted to multitask a little while watching); though it's far from the worst dub out there, in fact I'd say the acting is fairly decent (maybe not the translations, I’ll defer to Japanese speakers on that), it's not as good as what I've seen from the sub. The soundtrack is also fairly nice; there are a few tracks, particularly the tribal sounding one and some of the more J-pop sounding ones, that are campy and cliche, but it generally enhances OST generally enhances the anime fairly well. Like most anime of this length, it could have benefited from more tracks on the OST as it gets fairly repetitive and predictable near the end. However, there are quite a few brilliant sounding tracks in this OST; particularly some of the softer variations of the main theme.\
With as many deep, deep flaws that I've pointed out, one would expect me to say I did not enjoy this series at all and would not recommend it. But this is not the case. Despite it's flaws aesthetically and even though I intellectually bash it as a critic, as a simple fan there's something deeply enjoyable about Naruto. I'll admit this was my first exposure to anime as a child as I watched the dub come out as it was released in the States, but there's something more to my enjoyment of this anime than childhood nostalgia. Though there are too many battles and they are far too long-drawn out, something should be said for Naruto's battle scenes in that they are effectively used as a storytelling mechanism rather than a device to accomplish as much action as possible, as happens all to often in Shounen anime (eg., Code Geass R2). Additionally, sometimes the strategy involved in the battles is fascinating, especially if Shikamaru's involved. The plot in the first half also isn't a completely loss as it is at least entertaining, if poorly executed.\
\
Even the much-bashed filler arc is still enjoyable to watch; there are quite a few standout serials that do develop the characters well, such as Hinata in the search for the Beatle, Kurenai-sensai in Yakumo's serial, and Gaara in the Village of Painters. There are also a few serials that stand out as just being plain good stories, such as the Gosunkugi, the Star Village mission, and the search for Menma's memory (which was my favorite part of the entire series). There's also something to be said, at least in some of the serials, for the atmosphere created by the episodic nature of the filler arc. Some of my favorite anime are episodic atmospheric series such as Mushishi and there's a sense in which Naruto's filler arc is similar, if vastly inferior in quality. In fact, I'm the first to defend an anime that lets plot take the back seat and focuses on character development and atmosphere, such as Mushishi, Hotarubi no Mori E, Hotaru no Haka, or Sword of the Stranger. This style is an accurate reflection of the Noh tradition in Japanese theater and a refreshing escape from the over-domination of plot in western storytelling that we've inherited from Aristotle. If Naruto had been episodic from the beginning and had executed its atmosphere better, the filler arc would've been fine and even completely enjoyable; but it was ultimately a letdown after the first half which was extremely plot-based and was ruined by poor attempts at humor.\
To sum up, despite all its flaws, it is easy to see why Naruto is among the most popular anime out there, especially among younger viewers and I still thoroughly enjoy it. It's an easy watch, highly entertaining, fairly easy to pick up in the middle (which makes it perfect for Cartoon Network's clientele), and the characters are very likable if bad in a literary sense. If you have the time to dedicate to it (and at 220 episodes, it is quite an investment) I'd say it's worth watching. And everybody should watch the three-episode Menma serial if nothing else, which works great as a stand alone. But definitely don't expect anything profound or stellar out of this anime, and be prepared to be vexed by its campy dialogue and awful filmography.\

       Well, you've got to admit Naruto is one of the most popular anime in the world, also because it's also aired in the US. However, popularity does not represent everything. Naruto, definitely was very ideal and imaginative with these super ninjas. \
   The three main characters, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura, all had a close relationship for they have been in a team for most of their time. Naruto and Sasuke, who were supposedly natural rivals, fought their best to compete each other and tease about the others' loss. By the time this arch enemy Orochimaru comes, this anime changes its\
          \
        environment.\
For the whole entire time, Sasuke leaves with Orochimaru, and therefore Naruto and Sakura tries their best to regain their lost friend. They all realize missing a friend could be fairly drastic towards everyday life. They tend to become stronger and fight with devilish opponents to move on and retrieve Sasuke. However, on the other hand, Sasuke refuses and once tried to kill Naruto because he had another objective in mind. Then, what kind of anime is this? Naruto and Sakura wants Sasuke back; they need him to be happy and believe that would do best for him. On the other hand, Sasuke refuses and fights back because he doesn't feel happiness in between their friendship. He wants to kill his brother who destroyed his clan. In the future, 'if' Naruto ever caught Sasuke, what would they even do? Put him in a cage and lock him so that he won't escape? That's totally ironic! They want him back, but they know he's become all crazy, so they don't know what to do, but to seriously injure him so that he won't go back to his evil scheme. Is that even true friendship?\
   The music is definitely great, for it gives different types of ideas. The music provides the thought of living in a peaceful village and swaying through history. One certain types of music from Naruto, it gives the idea of exciting actions full of thrill. The sound produced in Naruto is indubitably original and unique.\
   The part where I enjoyed Naruto the most would be the beginning, where all of the story tends to make sense. Yet, in the later episodes, the author seems to push on forcefully to draw random frustrating plots.\

    I have to say this anime was a huge disappointment. I used to be the biggest naruto fan, I mean ninjas whats not to like right? Watching it as it came out a few years back, I can see why this anime has the ratings it does. So I am trying to be as unbiased as possible. First those who haven't seen should be aware of is that this anime has a LARGE amount of filler and by LARGE amount I mean a LARGE amount. It felt like the author stopped caring half way through.The story starts off awesome, however becomes very very weak the\
          \
        only reason I'm giving it a 5 is for the action and a few touching moments. This anime by no means deserves anything above a 6-7 IF that. If you are looking for great story and action I would highly recommend One Piece. On a lighter note If you still think you're interested you should defiantly watch naruto for those few moments and amazing action.\

    This anime is not very good.\
The characters are unlikable, and ironically, the worst one is the main protagonist. They are all annoying and mind-wrenching, and distract from the story.\
It's executed poorly, and it takes way too long for fights, and explaining attacks, making the show too slowly-paced for an action show. \
Basically, this show is OK-for a kid. For someone like me, spoiled with Death Note and Urelmo, I hate it.\

Nearly every Naruto background character is Steve Blum, it is but I suppose you could have only seen two movies, or even just 1 movie and a door. Truly, no more words need be said. It is too bad that Sasuke leaves Hidden Leaf Village at the end of the series though.

    Naruto, Naruto, Naruto.\
This show gets a lot of hate and a lot of praise; rarely anything in between. I can understand both sides, if we're being honest here. This show is WAY overhyped, I will admit. Do I hate it? No. Do I love it? Almost ashamed to admit it.\
I think this show was the first show I actually watched the American premier and stuck with it after all these years. At first, I preferred the American version to the Japanese because I hated reading subtitles, but now I prefer the Japanese, only because some characters' voices are \"slightly\" less irritating. But both are fine.\
          \
\
Character-wise: Wow, where to begin? The characters in this show are ridiculously dramatic: tragic pasts, bad choices because of them, familial issues, blah blah blah. But despite their bitter attitudes, the main character, Uzumaki Naruto, somehow manages to change people's points of view almost every time without fail with his famous \"speeches\". Now I, personally, have never been in a fight, but I'm not sure any super villains will just stand around and watch you make a speech while wallowing in your own self-pity. Everyone eventually becomes obsessed with Naruto and after all those years of Naruto wishing everyone would like him, he ends up not giving a flying *$&^! Wanna know why? Uchiha Sasuke.\
Plot-wise: Yikes, Masashi Kishimoto, what have you done to Naruto? To your fans? To yourself? I think Kishimoto has enough plot holes to use as graves for every single Naruto character ever. But do fans turn the other cheek? Always. Why? Because we're so deep into this thing, why question anything now? Just shrug it off and wait for the next eye-roller he dishes out.\
The worst thing about this show? You guessed it! FILLERS ON FILLERS ON FILLERS ON FILLERS ON... Well, you get it. Need I say more?\
Yes, I'm bashing the ever-living daylight out of this show, but as I said before, I don't hate it. To be honest, I'll always hold a special place in my heart for Naruto. Yeah, yeah, corny, I know. Would I recommend it? I'd be too ashamed to. I'd tell you to run the other way immediately before you get sucked it.\
And still, I rate it a 7. I've been with it from the beginning and I saw it through the end.\

    Okay so the art and sound was of any anime, but that's not the point. The story seemed intesting at one point, but it fell apart. Way too nija cliché . It was devastating. I heard so much about this series and was expecting so much more. The characters were simple. The main character was the \"apprentice wants to become the best there is and travels with his friends to achieve his goal\" kind, which we haven't seen much of *coughPOKEMONcough*. It was dumb. And the humor was terrible too. I think that this anime is really only meant for anime junkies or otakus who\
          \
        don't care much for the story and just care for the cool outfits and sayings in the stories. This story had way too much of bad comedy, obssessed girls(which tried too hard to be funny and it sucked), and a lame plot. It really ticks me off that people even dare compare this series to Bleach. ? Really? Bleach actually has some depth to the plot and some sensibility in it. It shows devotion, romance, trust, and all the rich ingredients of a hit show. Naruto may have devotion but its cheap and crappy. This was such a let down. :[ Sorry all Naruto fans.\

    Besides having a cool theme/platform, Naruto doesn't have too much to offer.\
Even though this anime is ridiculously comical and annoying at times(due to over-exposition) it also has a very likable story. Naruto didn't exactly play it safe with all of its hidden secrets the story is based around, secrets that are completely shielded hundreds of episodes into the series. Its clear that what still keeps Naruto shining as a story is its characters, say what you want but Naruto is definitely considered to be the most recognized anime ever--and the general story isn't exactly a masterpiece. \
So, about those characters: Am I implying that without\
          \
        them being exactly how they are Naruto would've failed? NO. The idea of such a sad upbringing leading up to these characters is what makes them so much more special. In the first episodes of Naruto you're getting a glimpse of what Narutos entire childhood has been like, and before you know it things are lookin' up! This makes you feel personally attached to Naruto or at the very least makes you appreciate how much you get to see Naruto progress throughout the show(which, is what the show is solely about for the most part).\
The main problem people have with Naruto is; it's 'mainstream' or 'too hyped', both of which are formed from peer pressure basically. Mainstream is not a bad thing, it just means they're giving people what they know they want. As long as it's still enjoyable who cares? And as for the hype, all I have to say is: Nothing great(whether positive or negative) goes without hype, does hype change anything though? Hype always comes with a reason. Example: R*pe. \
Lastly I'd just like to say, MOST ANIMES AREN'T MEANT TO BE PERFECT--JUST ENJOYABLE. I've seent many animes and I like all types - can't you stop trying to be a critic and just try to enjoy it? I did and its only made me happier, so why not? \

    I first watched Naruto, by way of fansubs, when it had just come out and it was still only in the Japnese audience. I remember that I was instantly hooked after watching the first maybe five episodes and because of that continued to follow the series.\
Basically, I can tell you that the story is pretty decent. At the beginning it takes some time for them to get to the true plot line which is Naruto's nine tail fox; however, the arcs before the real plot line present a basis for the main plot line. And, I can honestly say that while I was watching the\
          \
        arcs like the 'wave country' and etc etc, that it was quite entertaining and it was a 'page turner'. \
Nonetheless, the entire story is a bit stereotypical, but it is enjoyable nevertheless. \
The whole story is action-packed w/ plenty of comedy.\
The characters are a bit stereotypical as well. Naruto is the hero that people don't understand; Sasuke is the loner that nobody can understand. However, this is not a problem as the way they present them seem to be original in itself. \
Well, overall I could write a lot more about this series, but if me to get to the point then here it is.\
The fillers killed this series, like no other. I think that there are actually more fillers in Naruto then there is real episodes. \
Therefore, what should you do to remedy this fact?\
You should just skip all fillers and head straight to the main plot because the main plot is something that is quite interesting and entertaining, while the fillers are just plain horrible and bad. \
Believe me, I tried to watch some of them and the fillers of Naruto were extrememly boring and had no originality whatsoever. \
Anyways watch this series, I'm sure you will like it, but skip all the fillers because it will just screw the show up for you. \

    Naruto! Oh wow! This is the BEST anime I had ever seen! I ranked it #1 on my anime list actually. Naruto is very inspirational, full of good values and adventures that wil take each one of us in very thrilling fantasy. Because of this anime I became more and more like Naruto, friendly, brave and  strong! I adore every statement of the characters, even if  he/she is bad or good. This anime shows not only fantasy but also reality. It reveals every characters' sorrows and happy moments. I believe that this anime is NOT boring, you will eventually get closer to the\
          \
        true personality of each characters, you could feel hatred or be amaze of that certain character.\
Story: THE BEST. I rated it as an outstanding one. Every episodes lead to another closer look to the character. I know it got lot of fillers, but it doesn't really matter!! What matter is to understand the importance of the story not what you are seeing wrong on the series.\
Art: THE BEST.I rated it again as the best because of the well-made fighting scenes although there are a lot of troubles in the fighting sequences.\
Sound: THE BEST. I really like the sound, the BGM and most especially the OP and ED songs! The BGM suits every scenes and every character, from the happiest to the saddest music.\
Character: THE BEST. Very well molded characters. Each revealing unique attitudes and emotions. Naruto series really shows that each one of us iare UNIQUE.\
Enjoyment: I really enjoy this anime! It makes me happy all day! \
And I rated this anime as a top-notched. Thanks Kishimoto,for making this anime full of adventure and thrill!",

    -The fans are waiting for the plot to continue, we need to delay it. We will need fillers, lots of fillers.\
-Hundrends of fillers...\
-But my lord, there is no such force...\
\"doors open to reveal a sea of fillers\"\
-This night... You will feast on the patience of fans!!!!\
\"But Bleach had a lot of fillers! And you gave it a perfect 10!!! You hypocrite!\" Yes, but Bleach had filler ARCS! Consistent, well directed, logically lengthed, ARCS! And gradually improving ones too. The Nozomi Arc (the last one) was in fact as good as the main story if not better. Naruto on the other hand has one-shot episodes. AWFULLY\
          \
        written, one-episode fillers that add nothing to the story and are in fact a real pain to watch. Also, Bleach didn't interrupt the main story more than the number of Filler Arcs. Naruto on the other hand usually throws one main story episode and follows it with a filler one. This is unbelievably annoying, as you feel the story keeps getting interrupted by fillers. CONSTANTLY. \
Main story episodes concerned, Naruto offers amazing battles (especially the exam episodes at the start of the series were AWESOME) that leave you really impressed. The rules of combat are well explained (moves cannot be repeated indefinitely, every skill has a weakness, people get tired, etc etc) and the music makes the fights all the better (keep in mind that the length of the fights is pretty good). Character designs are also very distinctive, so that, like bleach, you will remember almost everyone (and unlike One Piece I might add).\
A problem that appears halfway through the anime and starts appearing waaaayyy too often later on, is the obsession of the mangaka with \"history repeating itself\". The first time this became evident it was quite cool, as you didn't expect such a good ideology from the script. The second time you still liked it but a bit less. The third time you just patiently waited for the anime to get over with it. AFTER 100 TIMES IT'S REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF. Every team in existance is composed of 2 men and one woman. One of the men is quite serious and cool, the other is a fool that constantly draws attention to himself by acting stupid, but is in truth the big-hearted one. EVERY, F$%KING, TEAM. Calling the plot \"repetitive\" would be the understatement of the year. \
Another thing that quickly becomes annoying, especially in Shippuden, is how the show constantly throws at us that Naruto had a rough, unfair childhood. Again, the first time it was a very welcome addition to the anime, showing how far Naruto has come to be respected by his peers. But when it's done in every single episode you really start hating it. No more flashbacks please! I don't care how much money you save with the animators! Get on with the plot! \
If the above weren't enough out of the three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura) Naruto is a complete idiot, Sasuke can't decide between being emo, an avenger or Itachi's little brother and Sakura keeps pursuing the same guy for about... The whole anime + Shippuden. Not the most inspiring of leads to be sure. In fact if it wasn't for the awesome battle music I'm pretty sure Naruto would be hated by everyone. (Oh and for the record: I absolutely hate Jiraya as a character, there I said it!)\
Find an episodes list that doesn't include the fillers and go watch it, for the battles alone it is totally worth it.\

Also ninja are stealthy, they stick to the shadows and use swords and shuriken NOT some dragon ball z crap. Plus he's is a goku knockoff, 9 tails, super sayian anyone? If sasuke wants to leave, let him, don't make a whole 2 or 3 seasons of fillers that have nothing to do with anything. \"Curry of life\" REALLY!?\

    Everyone makes Naruto out to be the most beginner anime out there; you can't watch anything until you've finished Naruto. While it is an older anime, and it isn't a bad anime, there are many things about Naruto that can be hard to follow, lame, or just cliche. Naruto comes along to be one of the greatest anime in existence - but I have to disagree. Like many of us here, we can agree that Naruto is a good anime... but it is a far cry from masterpiece.\
I have not finished all of Naruto, but I have watched most of it. I have an idea\
          \
        on how the rest of the anime will run. \
Story (6)\
For those of you who read the summary, this anime is about a young male, Naruto Uzumaki, who wants to surpass the Hokage, or leader of the Leaf Village, through training and hard work as a Shinobi (ninja). It was one of things that had originally drew me into this anime. It seemed incredibly original, and it actually is. Many well-detailed plot twists, interesting plot at times, and moments of triumph reign this anime supreme. But that's only a small part of the anime outside of the filler episodes that go through it. \
The original story of Naruto does sound very nice... it's about Naruto who wants to be Hokage. But the anime dwells further and further away from Naruto's dream that it starts showing up less in the main episodes and starts making a new home inside of the filler episodes, where you can watch literal hours of Naruto trying to learn something, fail, and then do something \"spectacular\" or \"creative\" to master a technique. I kid you not, it's one of the most boring things to watch in an anime... ever.\
As I mentioned before, the plot about Naruto begins to fade and shed new light on anime all-time favorite character Sasuke Uchiha, the last of the Uchiha clan, who survived a massacre not too long before the events of the anime, and when he wants revenge on a certain man. This is a great side-plot, but the thing that bugs me the most is that many episodes focus on Sasuke's dark desire to bring his family the justice they deserve. I believe several people already pointed it out in other reviews... You being watching many filler Naruto scenes, and many plot-ridden Sasuke scenes.\
Like I said, for the most part, story's really nice. But the amount of filler and add-ons were enough to make four different Naruto mini-series called Sasuke, Naruto Training, Goofy Garbage, and Boring Garbage.\
Art (8)\
Graphics are at the best an 8. The character designs were key in my approval of the art style, but the animation flunked some times and characters could be unrecognizable in combat unless they were the focus of the camera. The art style, in my opinion, while old - looks very clean and nice, and I find it to be very creative and appealing to look at, even if it lacks detail in far-ranged shots. Again, character design was cool. Kakashi looks wonderful and like a true ninja and the members of the Akatsuki are pretty unique.\
Sound (8)\
Some music is good, other parts, not good. The opening songs in Naruto are very annoying and forgettable, as I found myself reaching for my remote to skip ahead of it and try not the die from ear blood loss. I don't know how others feel about the openings, but personally, I find all of them to be very horrible.\
Sound effects used are comical and had me laughing a lot at times. Naruto's blissful stress and irritation can be seen entirely through the noise each character makes when they are in such states of distaste. Especially Sasuke. Snotty little boy. \
Character (9)\
Characters are my favorite things in Naruto. While they can be repetitive and lack originality, which is why I give this section a 9 over a 10, most of the people in this are very interesting and make memorable moments through-out the anime, even Rock Lee, who had me scared at night thinking about that bowl cut and perfectly round eyes. Most characters have their flaws and evil sides, which is what makes for a truly interesting character, even Naruto, who has the spirit of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox inside of him, an aspect that makes the Hidden Leaf Village have large urges against him.\
Enjoyment (7)\
Story is good, lots of humor added in there, enjoyable characters, and generally interesting action sequences are what make this have a higher rating. However, even with the pros listed above, Naruto has many moments of filler episodes, fights that last for 10+ episodes, and events that happen in the fillers that had me pulling my teeth out. I get that it's not necessary to watch filler episodes, but it still exists. Very hard to enjoy watching repetitive things happen during the course of Naruto's training, especially when he is with Pervy Sage (Jiraiya). So I give this a 7.\
Overall (7)\
To round this off, Naruto isn't a bad anime. It's definitely one someone should hit if they haven't already, but don't expect your socks to be flying off during the events of what happen in this anime. This anime is good - but it isn't as great as everyone makes it out to be. If you have the time to be sitting through 200+ episodes, go ahead and watch this, and be sure to skip the filler episodes unless you want to be bald from tearing your hair out.\

    Naruto was one of the first anime I watched. Along with Dragon Ball Z, I basically grew up watching Naruto every Saturday night on Toonami. The English dub itself isn't terrible but it's not the best I've seen. \
Now that I've rewatched Naruto, I can honestly say that Naruto is a very fitting 7. \
Story: 8\
Naruto's story is similar to a lot of shonen anime, and people give it a lot of hate for being \"stereotypical.\" While the background for Naruto is a bit bland, the story of Team 7 is well written. \
The beginning arcs of Naruto were very well done. The villains themselves\
          \
        weren't too bland and stereotypical. Towards the middle, it began to fall off. Sasuke's character was way to edgy and overall was bad. Kishimoto completely left Sakura behind and she basically became luggage for Naruto and Sasuke. \
The whole idea of Sasuke looking for power so he could have revenge was pretty bland too. Later, Sasuke's story line becomes \"I'm basically jealous of Naruto becoming strong so I'm going to be a dick.\" \
The addition of the Akatsuki was the best thing that happened to the series. It gave a good villain for the end of the story and part 2.\
The Sasuke retrieval arc was probably the most well written arc. It gave attention to some of the other characters in the series like Neji, Choji, Shikamaru, and Kiba. These characters were basically neglected for a while by Kishimoto.\
The filler arcs are hit and miss. If I had known that none of the arcs were cannon as a kid, I probably wouldn't have watched them. After the Sasuke Retrieval Arc they basically put the series into permanent filler and sprinkled in cannon stuff. \
Art: 7\
Kishimoto had a very nice art style and probably the most realistic. This series probably has the least amount of fan service. Some characters are a little bit more on the unrealistic side, but they are still realistic. \
The fighting sequences are very well done too. They aren't going to be as realistic but it definitely is the most pleasing to the eye.\
Sound: 6\
The sounds in Naruto are better than some anime, but they are still horrendous. The sounds of people storing chakra is probably as bad as Dragon Ball Z. Grunting, Grunting everywhere, so watch with headphones unless you want people to think you're watching hentai. Not to mentions the screams. Some of the screams are ok but they are overused and again, almost as bad as Dragon Ball Z.\
The soundtrack itself is pretty solid. Naruto has a pleasant mix of orchestral music and that cheesy shonen guitar music. Fighting scenes are matched with good music that will leave you interested. This is probably the only thing that saved me from giving Naruto a 4 in sound.\
Character: 7\
Naruto has some really good characters, and some really bad ones. Kishimoto neglected a lot of characters. Character development for some characters are good, while some characters like Sakura almost serve no purpose in being in the show at times. \
Shonen cliches everywhere. Orphans everywhere. Naruto also gets a lot of flak because of the shipping. If you watch the series, you know what I'm talking about, and it gets a little bit old.\
Enjoyment: 8\
If I had written this as a kid I probably would have given it a 10. Overall, Naruto does provide you with action packed scenes. It gives you everything you want from a shonen, it just lacks in originality sometimes. The story itself is original, but the characters are bland at points.\

    I won't lie, it's the best anime for me. Everything is just perfect there. I'm not like professional, I just write what I felt. I might be typical mainstream boy you would say, but I don't care. So, let's begin:\
Story: It focuses on a boy punished by fate. Even though normal person would kill himself, he didn't give up and faced it. It's beautiful story how he followed his life rules becoming a hero. I don't want to think what would happen without him in Naruto world. 10/10\
Art: Far best line I've seen, but that is only for personal likes. Everything looks just beautiful, there\
          \
        is no other word. 10/10\
Sound: Very much memorable. Fits the actions, you can cry when hearing it next time. If we are talking about openings and endings very much from this anime I am listening even when playing some games ^^. Same as art - personal likes. 10/10\
Character: Much characters with own personalities. We got positive main positive one, emo one, tsundere one, mystery one, hero one... Everything you want to be happy :D. 10/10\
Enjoyment: Well, I enjoyed it overall. I kinda don't understand this one. It was my first anime, everytime I enjoy some anime I eat my fingers. They were bleeding *don't mind it I'm just weird*. So I guess it's fine. 10/10\
Overall: Personally, I tried to think about characters. About their life. What they came through. It gave me lesson of my life. It is my life. It's something special to me. It's perfect. And it's still going on. It has much episodes - it's fine, because after watching u want more and more. And you are happy because of that. And it's still going! 10/10\

    I've both read the Naruto manga and watched the Anime. My personal summary is I absolutely love the entire series. I liked the following Naruto Shippuden a tad better, but all in all  Naruto is the perfect kickstart for this epic story. Naruto is popular for a very good reason, but as with anything popular this also leads to haters just for that reason. \
I believe Naruto shows us many elements of real life. Even re-reading and re-watching it in my 30's I believe it has life lessons that would make the world a better place and myself a better person. Having guts, valuing\
          \
        friendship, banning hatred. I believe some of these are taught in the story in a very strong way. \
Story:\
Especially when re-watching I enjoyed the introduction of characters, jutsu and other elements of the narotoverse. To me, everything makes sense and the build-up towards emotional developments, clashes between friends and incremental strength of characters is well thought out. All things introduced, later appear to have been mentioned for a reason. Not in a big announcement kind of way, but very distinctive.\
Art:\
Maybe not all of the artwork has the same amount of detail and attention. That being said, some of the scenes featuring hand-to-hand combat are magnificent. For me the artwork is good enough to have some elements in my child's bedroom. Can't be that bad then aye?\
Sound:\
No discussion. Intro and outro are continuously good. Changing every 20 episodes or so. But the real winner here is the beautifully matching and emotional music during various scenes. I know they've pushed me over the edge of having some tears every now and then. Simply beautiful.\
Character:\
Some characters annoy me. However, Naruto gives you many many options to choose your favourite character from. In addition almost all of them get enough screentime and a fair share of character development. Some, I simply like more than others (Naruto, Sasuke, Itachi, Shikamaru, Jiraya, Kakashi). Some (Sakura, Ino, Choji, Shino) are a bit shallow. Nevertheless the connection between most of the characters and the briliant development (and backstory) of some of them made me connect with the whole story. \
Enjoyment:\
Both the manga and the anime I enjoyed very much. I personally could not get enough of Naruto, so I even enjoyed the filler episodes.\

    I watched Naruto when I was a kid, because there was nothing else on TV. So I had to basically do with what I had. I didn't particulary enjoy it at the time either because there were more interesting shows on air like the hilarious dub for Duel Masters which is one of my all-time favorites.\
Naruto? Pfft, sure, the first, like 30 episodes are alright, up until the genin exam is over or whatever that shit was. And then Sasuke turns up the edge levels so high you could cut yourself if you touched the screen. The character development is an absolute joke and if\
          \
        you actually have some taste you'd know that someone who spouts nonsense about growing stronger and whatever the fuck else while managing to be so incredibly annoying and without any redeeming values whatsoever except the fact that they are vaguely fascinating to look at when genderbent, cannot be a good lead character.\
And you'd be right! Naruto is one of the, if not THE worst lead characters of all fucking time. A harem protagonist is more entertaining to watch than this bloke. It's obvious he's going to win every fight, it's obvious he's gonna train hard and get better every time. It's painfully obvious whenever someone smiles off-cam that something evil and spooky is gonna happen.\
Now I know the general consensus about this load of trash, it got most people into anime(unfortunately) and also unfortunate is the fact that they didn't stop after Naruto, they went after other edgy shows like Tokyo Ghoul and whatever other miraculous trainwreck and made the scores skyrocket. The fandom is garbage for this show but that's not related to it's show itself, just tangentially.\
You see, this show gathers all your pains and hardships from when you were an oppressed Eastern European infant with a fox in your guts and turns it into the most disgusting power trip you'll ever see, it's delusional, and suspension of disbelief only goes so far. Perhaps the delusional premise is what is most attractive when it comes to Naruto. Cause that shit just doesn't happen, ever, and if you're gonna be a smartass and tell me it's fiction, then tell the genius behind this series to make fiction credible within it's own described limits and not just plop a twist and jump the powerlevels by a googol every time he feels like it.\
It's strangely entertaining to watch things fly on the screen but at that point you're basically okay with just about anything ranging from flies circling your lightbulb or Michael Bay. Naruto is basically the B-Movie of anime.\
The budget for this is trash so the show looks as you might expect, the sound is, like, something to write home about in the sense that it's so boring you have to tell someone how boring it is. Terrible in fact, the music is trash too. Didn't have to be anything high-brow but damn they could've hired some better bands to perform instead of those garage party trash lid bangers that worked on this.\
If you want a power-level heavy show that really does take its time to tell you how people got those powers, in detail, bit by bit. Wasting a good two episodes or three to show you how people die. Then go for DBZ.\
If you just want a good shounen, a story about growing up and becoming stronger, with some real actual emotion. A Sasuke archetype that isn't completely shit. A god damn banging OP that will stay with you till your very last day. Then go with the king. YuYu Hakusho. That's my baby, that's my secret ingredient. If you feel the strange necessity to call this a good anime because you get nostalgic when you watch it, then do take in consideration the fact that you're basing it off the fact that you get nostalgic when you watch it, not because it's good. And it's true. Naruto is fucking garbage.\

    Hmm... I got bored and decided to write this. Also, pardon the fact i might have no T's or more than one. My key is broken.\
anyway, Naruto is a hit or miss show. You either love or you hate it. I have yet to finish it, yes, [it's on hold >>] but despite that, I have been attempting to keep up with the manga.\
Story: Kind of cliche, run on, and weird. but it keeps you coming back for more. Which is what good anime/manga are supposed to do.\
Art: Not the best by far. It's decent at parts but at others, the characters tend to have\
          \
        \"Derp\" faces, or noodle arms. There are parts, however, where the animation is almost flawless.\
Sound: Narutos voice will annoy the hell out of you at first.. It will, but you'll get used to it. Same with everyone else's. The openings and endings are usually very well chosen, and the music used gives the right amount of emotion.\
Character: You'll love them or hate them. Just like every character. But they do go through some changes that make them better.\
Enjoyment: can't really say i enjoyed this. i loved it, i hated it. it frustrated me -- still does -- but it had the right amount of emotion.\

    I used to like this series.\
I used to enjoy it.\
Not anymore.\
This series does not age well.  I found the apex of the series to be the Chunnin Exams and the very moment that Naruto decks out Gaara was probably one of the better moments showing the differences between the two.  \
But now, looking back....it wasn't worth the time.\
Some of my favorite series have less episodes to work with and tell more interesting stories.  \
Some of my favorite series have less plot, but are a lot more enjoyable.\
And some of my favorite series run less than the amount of filler episodes in this\
          \
        series.  \
Overall, I lost interest.  I still like a couple of the characters.  But I've outgrown the series.  \
Naruto himself as a character stopped being interesting and was turning into the whinny little kid type I found throughout the series.  Sakura is just useless and Sasuke reminds me of a slow and way dialed up emo Hiei from Yu Yu Hakusho.  \
This series is a cash cow, it was fun at the time, but now it's run it's course and doesn't age well.\
A lot of the series development is either pointless or easy to see from miles ahead.  \
It's easy to see why kids from 10-17 like it. But I'm 23 and outgrew that trend.\
There are better series out there.  Pass on this if you haven't watched it.\

    Unlike most Naruto fans, I didn't grow up watching it. I never had some kind of emotional connection with it. It was only recently that I decided to watch it, and that was only because everyone was talking about how good it was and blah blah blah. Now, almost a year after I finished the show, Naruto is one of the few anime that I believe is truly outstanding! Don't be scared by the 720 episodes of the franchise. It seems a lot, but it isn't. Watching the first 10-20 episodes of the series didn't give me a different impression; it was just another anime\
          \
        about ninja, I thought! When the actual plot began, I couldn't get myself away from the screen. It was so interesting that I just couldn't help but wanting to know what was going to happen next! But why is Naruto so good? Let's start with the story. It's appears to be pretty simple! The story is set in an alternative world where ninjas exist. It's an easy and believable concept that you don't have to think to much about. Then we have the characters! There are so many characters in the Naruto series, but each of them is so unique, that I can remember everyone's names AND surnames. The main character, Naruto, is not perfect, which is something that makes the series even better. Throughout the series we see his flaws, his troubles, his actions and we also see him grow up and change into a better person. He is not a kid who has a perfect life and wants to be a hero. He has a goal, and a reason for that goal. All that make Naruto's character more realistic and more relatable.\
Then we have the Antihero of the series, Sasuke. Sasuke is the exact opposite of Naruto, and at the same time, they are so alike. Sasuke's character is also not perfect. He himself has many flaws and has made many mistakes throughout the series. But what truly makes him a good character is that he ALSO has a reason for his actions. I can't write any of the details because I'm trying not to spoil anything. Moving on to the soundtrack. I am a soundtrack lover. Naruto's soundtrack is unlike anything you have ever heard before. It combines traditional Asian instruments with modern rhythms. The result of that was outstanding. And if you become a fan of this series, some of these soundtracks will stick in your brain for life and whenever you hear it, you'll feel nostalgic. Next we have the Art. Naruto is not a recent anime, so don't expect the highest quality. But to tell you the truth, that didn't matter. At least not to me. I enjoyed the show despite that. Besides, the quality gets better in Shippuden. Finally, the most important feature of not just the show, but the entire franchise, are the hidden meanings and messages it has about life. I often find myself following the examples that Naruto characters set in the series. Overall, I think that the Naruto franchise is a hidden gem among the anime world, and I highly recommend it. It doesn't matter how old you are! I plan to watch it again one day, with my kids. One thing is for certain; Naruto will always have a special place in my heart!  \

    I’m not ashamed to admit that I love Naruto. It is my favourite anime of all time and no matter how good the anime is that i watch in the future nothing can ever compare to the feeling of nostalgia i have towards this amazing show, Naruto was one of this first proper anime i ever watched and growing up watching the same characters grow and get stronger made me enjoy every episode even more.\
Naruro is known as one of the \"Forbidden 4\" it is one of the biggest anime of all time and is still going to this day (as of making this review),\

        the only thing i can say is if you want to watch a anime with an amazing cast of characters a long running show that you can watch for hours on end with amazing fights and great story arcs then i highly recommend checking this show out then watching its successor Naruto Shippuden.\
This review might seem a little biased and not very helpful but its hard to find anything wrong with a show you love so much, sure the animation might not be great anymore and there is alot of fillers but if you can look past that the story makes up for it, and at the end of the day great characters and an amazing story is more than enough to check this out in my opinion. \

    Naruto was one of my first anime that I just found randomly on TV. After that I watched like first 35 episodes and then they stopped it...\
\
I really liked Sasuke and Naruto, and even then Sakura was useless at least I though so.\
What got me into it? It probably has to be the idea of ninjas, wars and mostly Naruto's and Sasuke's back story.\
The idea of a fox that was sealed inside a little boy was mind blowing to me. And that everyone hated him, because of it kinda reminded me where I was at the time.\
The openings was really good as well, but\
          \
        there was some openings that I didn't really enjoyed as much as others.\
Watching this anime was a great experience, because after they stopped airing it on TV I remembered about it after 2 yrs ago and then got really into it...\
Naruto thought me one thing: It's to never give up, no matter how bad it looks.\

    A lot of friends recommended this anime to me so i had high expectations. But i didn't really  enjoy it. There were many things that bothered me, such as that there were many fillers. But the one thing that i hated the most was that the show was focused on sasuke..!! Sasuke is so cool..Sasuke is so strong..Sasuke is so mysterious..NO..!!! Sasuke is selfish, hateful and the only thing he cares about is revenge..! theres nothing cool about that..! The main character is NARUTO..! And yet the show makes him look like a total loser, stupid and weak..!! I didn't hate sasuke but i\

        wanted Naruto as the main character to have more attention focused on him..\

    Well I have to say I was dissaponted in this anime a bit. Its very over exaggerated. Well the characters are much too simple and lack depth. Though they are comical which could be a decent aspect. Characters here tend to tug at my tolerance. They dont feel relateable. I dont feel that connection between character and audience. Honestly the main character{Naruto} just seems to piss and moan. Theres too many fillers and fights drag on for episodes. The art is bearable. But the plot isnt too complex either and theres almost no plot twists. For older audieneces, I feel this is more like a\
          \
        waste of time. That audienece have tendency to enjoymore thought provoking shows. As for a younger auidence I think this might be enjoyable.\

Ak: Hm...? Hey! I found a PS2 game in here!\
NK: Thanks, Akyn.  That needs to be over here.\
Ak: I didn't know you used to like Naruto!\
NK: You found Ultimate Ninja, didn't you?\
Ak: Yep!  Hey, why'd you stop watching Naruto, anyway?\
NK: Well, I was reading the manga at the same time, and I got tired of all the filler episodes.  Of course, I didn't read all of it, either.  Stopped shortly after the Shippuden switch.\
Ak: Oh...why'd you start watching it?\
NK: Because it had ninja in it.  Why wouldn't I start watching it?\
Ak: Do you watch everything with\
          \
        ninjas in it?\
NK: Not much anymore.  I used to be obsessed with ninja, though.\
Ak: So, do you like Naruto?\
NK: Still?  A little bit.  It had some funny moments, and some of the characters weren't half bad.\
Ak: Like who?\
NK: Hinata and Kiba were a couple of my favorites when I watched it, and I still like Kakashi.\
Ak: How come?\
NK: He's such a serious leader in tight spots, but he has a good sense of humor, as well.\
Ak: Even though there was a lotta filler, did you still like the story?\
NK: Yeah, it was pretty interesting.\
Ak: Any part you liked best?\
NK: The Chuunin Exam was my favorite arc, especially the individual fights.  Those were really well animated.\
Ak: Any scene in particular?\
NK: Hmm...my favorite scene was actually before the Chuunin Exam.  It was the Water Dragon Jutsu clash between Kakashi and Zabuza.  I used to have the hand seals memorized for that.\
Ak: Wow!\
NK: Just wasted time, really.\
Ak: So, you're not gonna watch the rest?\
NK: Nope.  The story got really complicated even without the filler, plus there's only so much bad voice acting one can take.\
Ak: You think others should watch it?\
NK: It's a good beginner anime that covers all different types of characters, so those who don't know much about anime could start with Naruto.  I wouldn't recommend watching the entire series, though.\
Ak: 'Kay!\
NK: All right, next drawer.\

    Naruto... Either you love him or you hate him, there is no denying the fact that the manga and anime are huge successes. Being one of the big 3 alongside Bleach and One Piece, Naruto is considered to be the most popular anime in the UK, US, and Canada, so it is definitely a money maker for Studio Pierrot and Shonen Jump, and you can definitely see that in how the anime was handled. Before I start this review, I want you to know that I am actually a HUGE fan of this franchise. In fact, the manga and anime is the reason why I\
          \
        started watching other shows. This anime also has affected me in a personal level, so this will without a doubt affect my overall score of the show. As you can probably see, I gave this show a 10, but that's due to my love for the show. HOWEVER, the final score I will be giving this anime in the review will be solely based on the show, and I will try my best to be unbiased.\
Story - 6\
Everybody knows the basic premise of this show. A young ninja who is ostracised by everyone due to the fact that he is the Jinchuuriki of the Kyubi (Nine Tailed Fox) that destroyed the Hidden Leaf Village. The truth is I love the story of the original manga. While many consider the story to be generic shonen that doesn't try anything to differentiate itself, those who say that usually don't realise that Naruto is one of the reasons why there are so many shonens following the same formula. The story worked, it's easy to follow, and it's really inspiring, and the success of that formula has led to many shonen stories after it to follow the same structure. HOWEVER, this is hardly present in the anime. This is due to the incredible amount of filler that just brings the story down. The flow of the story is continuously interrupted due to stupid filler episodes. There were only a handful of filler that I found enjoyable. An example would be the episode where Team 7 tries to figure out what's under Kakashi's mask. While I can definitely endure filler episodes if I love the franchise enough, and that is definitely true for Naruto because I was able to watch every single episode, and rewatch it again years later, I still think that the story could have been better if these fillers at least had a little substance. \
Art - 6\
I think you've probably seen the pictures of characters in the anime having outstretched limbs and weird facial expressions. A very popular one is Sasuke looking weird as hell in his battle against Naruto in the Final Valley. However, this is a common animation technique that even the very successful video game OVERWATCH uses in the game, so I won't criticise Studio Pierrot for doing it. In fact, the fight scenes are probably the best parts of every episode, due to the animation. But sadly, this anime isn't as beautiful as it should have been. If you read the original manga, you would definitely agree with me when I say that Masashi Kishimoto is probably a master in adding attention to detail. His pages are gorgeous, and sadly the anime cannot replicate it. To be honest, Studio Pierrot is definitely capable of creating a beautifully looking anime, but sadly it seems like they got lazy when animating this series.\
Sound - 8\
Naruto's soundtrack beautifully merges traditional japanese instruments with Rock, creating an interesting fusion that works well with the series. In fact, no anime's soundtrack is as iconic as Naruto's. The main theme is easily recognisable for any anime fan, and there is a reason for that. The openings are also fantastic. Perfect examples are GO!!! and Re:member by the band FLOW, and Haruka Kanata by the extremely talented Asian Kung Fu Generation. As a non-japanese speaker, I still find these songs to be awesome. Especially when I was a kid, I would listen to these songs almost everyday on my way to school (pretty embarrassing now that I think about it).\
Character - 7\
I can't hate the characters for one reason, the anime does an AMAZING job in developing the cast. Because the series is long-running, the anime can dedicate episodes to many of its characters, so at no point does any of the characters seem useless to the story. Naruto is your typical shonen MC. Stupid, loud mouthed, huge appetite, and the willingness to never give up. Again, I believe that Naruto is one of the reasons alongside Goku and Luffy that this archetype is so common in many animes, so I don't think I should criticise Naruto for being generic.\
Enjoyment - 10\
I think this section of the review is based on my PERSONAL experience, so I obviously will give it a 10. This anime has a special place in my heart, and has affected me greatly. I love this series so much to the point that I overlook many of its flaws. I know a TRUE fan would be enraged at how Studio Pierrot handled the anime, but to me, I just love this series for starting my love of anime and manga.\
Overall - 6\
I gave it a 10 because of what Naruto has done for me. However, this final score is based solely on my review, and it definitely isn't a masterpiece. I still believe that this anime is a trendsetter, and for better or worse is one of the reasons for the incredible amount of shonen manga and anime in the late 90s and early 2000s. That's why I think it's an OKAY anime, but it's flaws keep it from being a great anime. Sadly, if handled by a different studio, this anime could have been just as good as One Piece and DBZ, but the limitations of budget, and Studio Pierrot's dedication to profit rather than creating an amazing series has led them to creating this series. However, I love it for what it is.\

    Out of all the long-running Shounen series that are out there, to me, one stands above the rest. Even though I only watched this anime recently, it holds a special place in my heart as my favorite long-running action anime that I have ever seen, and for good reason. \
Story:\
One of the main problem’s that plagues a lot of long-running Shounen’s is their ability to keep an interesting narrative throughout the entire run time of the show. They make it interesting by having the show made up of many different arc’s that each have their own stories, characters and problem’s that the characters must face.\
          \
        A lot of these arcs are self-contained stories that don’t do much for the plot, despite the quality of some arcs. Naruto, doesn’t really do that. While each arc does have their own problems that the characters face the overarching story and the reason these events are happening tie in to the constant narrative that plays throughout the whole show. The plot is always advancing and not once is it ever boring to watch since the characters are always growing and learning different things about their friends and the world that they live in. Normally, if I would ever review any long-running Shounen’s in the future, this would be the section where I do mini reviews of every main arc in the series, but considering the whole show plays out like one big narrative, it’s almost impossible for me to do that. \
The main story itself is compelling enough that it doesn’t feel like reason just to get cool characters to fight it out (Which is the vibe I’m getting from Bleach from my experience of watching it so far. The story in Naruto is always expanding, new characters get introduced, new villains emerge and while a lot of the events in this series are set up for what’s to come in Shippuden (Especially in the Sasuke Retrieval Arc) it’s still worth watching to see where the characters grow and mold into the people they are later in the story (I say this because it seems quite a few people skip this series and start with Shippuden). \
Not everything is flawless in this department, however. Naruto is notorious for having insane amounts of filler episodes and this show is one of the biggest offenders of this problem. It starts off harmless enough by having a recap episode, then a hot spring episode, a fun episode about Kakashi’s face and a five-episode arc about a race which would be fine if that was all it was. Instead of ending the show at the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, the show continues into 85 episodes of filler! Even for a long-running show like this one, 85 is an insane amount of filler episodes to have in a row. They even start the filler, right when the story was about to make it to the time-skip. While it was done to wait up for the manga, they could have just ended the original series and waited until they had enough material to start making Shippuden. Instead we got 85 episodes of low-quality random ninja missions that are close to unbearable to watch. I made it through the first few episodes of the first filler arc when I decided to stop and skip to the final episode. Even though this problem can be avoided now since you can just skip these episodes, it only really bugs me when I think of how long fans had to wait until the filler ended back when these episodes were airing. It may not be a problem now but it gets annoying when it still plagues Shippuden. But as I said before, you can just skip them now (Which is the most recommended option). So, in terms of the story department, Naruto does an excellent job considering all the filler is skippable. \
Characters:\
For long-running Shounen battle series, it is important to have cool, likable characters that make up the cast. No matter how cool the battles are, they won’t matter if you don’t care about who is fighting. Luckily, this is where Naruto shines the most. Naruto, as the protagonist of the story, does a great job to make the viewers root for him. Being the ultimate underdog, Naruto aims big in this series and is where the main emotion comes from throughout the show. He’s a boy that has nothing, that aims for everything. His relationship with the other main characters, his rival and best friend Sasuke, his love interest Sakura and his teacher Kakashi is what really drives this show and is what made this show so popular in the first place. As Naruto bonds with these characters you see him grow from being the village loser to their strongest ninja by doing nothing but making friends and working hard to get stronger. His struggles are relatable and his goals make sense for a person like him. At first, he causes trouble because he’s alone and he thinks that everybody hates him. But by meeting his new squad and bonding with other ninja, he becomes aware of how special friendship is and how you need bonds if you’re going to be Hokage (which is the head of the village).\
Apart from Naruto, the cast is made up of the coolest and craziest character’s I’ve seen in any anime. I already mentioned Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi but some of the best characters come in the form of rival ninja teams or the crazy villains that the heroes face. Among my favourites are Rock Lee (the lovable goofball), Shikamaru (the lazy genius), Hinata (the very shy, true love interest), Neji (the vengeful prodigy turned ally), Temari (this one is biased since she is my favourite female character) and Gaara (the frightening villain turned greatest ally). Even characters that I didn’t like at first like Ino, Choji, Kiba, Kankuro and Orochimaru turned out to be some of my favourite heroes and villains. But the best character (apart from Naruto himself) is Naruto’s perverted teacher, Jiraiya. Jiraiya is probably one of the most important characters in the series, mostly because of the impact he has on Naruto. While his squad leader Kakashi is training Sasuke, Naruto heads to Jiraiya who teaches him the Rasengan which becomes Naruto’s signature move and becomes Naruto’s father figure throughout the rest of the series. He’s motivation for Naruto to not give up and to continue moving forward with his dreams and ambitions. While I could continue with characters like Tsunade, Kabuto and Itachi, I’ll end this segment here by saying that out of all the other categories, Characters is what Naruto excels at the most.   \
Sound:\
The soundtrack is amazing. The songs are a nice mix of traditional Japanese music mixed in with bad-ass guitar. The Main Theme of the series is one of the most memorable, iconic and beautiful pieces of music to anybody that’s seen this show. If you haven’t heard it, you owe it to yourself to listen to it since it’s probably the most amazing song in the whole soundtrack. In terms of Openings and Endings, Naruto proves once again that just because it’s a long-running Shounen, it doesn’t need to half-ass it’s theme songs. Every Opening is a memorable J-Rock tune and not one of them is bad. It’s hard to pick a favorite from these songs which is why mine is a three-way tie between Haruka Kanata (OP 2), GO!!! (OP 4) and No Boy, No Cry (OP 6). The ED’s, while not as good as the OP’s, are still good and get the job done as Ending songs. Wind (ED 1), Viva Rock (ED 3) and Ima made Nando mo (ED 5) are my favorites while the others are still good, but not the most memorable. \
While I haven’t heard the Japanese voice acting since I watched the Dub, I can still judge the Dub and my god, is this a damn good Dub. Every voice actor hits the mark with every character they play. Maile Flanagan does an amazing job as Naruto and Yuri Lowenthal (who is one of my favorite voice actors) does one of my favorite performances from the show, as Sasuke who is one of the most iconic characters from the show. Tara Platt also does an amazing job as Temari considering that her performance is one of the main reasons that I like Temari so much. Other notable performances are Steven Blum as Zabuza and Orochimaru, Steve Stayley as Neji, Stephanie Sheh as Hinata, David Lodge as Jiraiya and Liam O’Brien as Gaara. Every other performance of the other main characters was also great but those were some of the best ones that were worth mentioning. If you couldn’t tell, Naruto also does a great job in the Sound department. \
Animation:\
Now to some of Naruto’s low points. The best way to describe this show is by saying that you’re basically watching an animated manga with a few great examples of amazing fight animation. While this isn’t Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters levels of barely animated, it’s noticeable considering there are a great number of shots that either linger or are completely still. Despite that, every fight in the show (and there are quite a lot) is always interesting to watch and is never boring to watch. The lack of animation during the dialogue sections of the show is made up for by the great animation for a lot of the fight scenes. Battles like Neji vs. Hinata, Rock Lee vs. Gaara, Naruto vs. Gaara, Naruto and Jiraiya and Tsunade vs. Orochimaru and Kabuto, Rock Lee vs. Kimimaro and Naruto vs. Sasuke are all excellent examples of fight animation in long-running Shounen battle series. \
The animation takes a turn for the worse, however, when you start getting into the filler episodes. They start off fine until the big 85 episodes of filler begins and you see how cheaply the episodes are made and how ugly everything looks. Speaking of things that look ugly, sometimes the character models will look strange and distorted which can come off as very weird and half-assed. I think this might be a problem in the manga as well but some of the off looking characters can be vary jarring when you see them for the first time. This happens very rarely so it’s not too much of a problem. Apart from that, the background art looks amazing and is highly detailed. Even if a shot is barely animated the backgrounds are always interesting to look at and is proof of the crazy amount of work that Masashi Kishimoto put into when he first published each chapter. The show can look extremely beautiful at times but still looks kind of blurry at times (which is a problem shared with Bleach which means that it’s more down to what Studio Pierrot was doing). Naruto does a great gob in the Animation department). \
Final Thoughts:\
Overall, if you are going to pick one of the Big 3 (Naruto, Bleach and One Piece) to watch, Naruto is your best bet. It’s fun, easy to get into and has a satisfying story where you see every character grow with every decision that they make in the show. It might be the only one worth watching in the end, since it hasn’t fallen apart like Bleach did and it might end unlike One Piece. Even though the show is 50% filler, you can still skip it which will make the experience shorter than what you may think. As it stands this first season of Naruto defined a whole new generation of anime fans when it premiered all the way back in 2002, and as it continues now in 2017, it continues to define a generation. A generation of Fighting Dreamers. \

    Ok so Naruto isn't all that bad but the problem is there are so many extra things that were added to this anime that really didn't need to be there. There is a complete abundance of filler episodes that add a bunch of characters that don't do anything for the story other than pose a temporary challenge for Naruto and never appears again. But if you go somewhere and find somewhere that will tell you which episodes are filler and skip them you should enjoy it. Also Naruto changes his personality almost at will in the first episode he was an annoying prankster who doesn't\

The history of anime is good, the plot is very good, the situations of struggle or story are good, the 'humanity' of some of the characters will disappear and others will emerge, and the end I thought it was good that we did a kind Bridge for shippuden.\
But there is a lot of ridiculous thing in Naruto, which are clichés, eg women, who are men (I'm not talking about Sasuke hehe), boring fillers '-', Kakashi model (ashamed to show your face), very cool guy call gai, three team in the Naruto practically had: the most badass (Sasuke, Neji, Kakashi, Orochi), was weaker\
          \
        than the most badass wanted to be better (Naruto, Lee, Obito, Jiraiya) and women healed wounds (Sakura, Ino, Rin, Tsunade).\
The animation is sometimes very zuada more in the general context it is good, the soundtrack is mythical, plus the voice acting is pretty bad.\
As it has many characters, some have the same personalities, plus the very different powers and objectives only has virtually Sasuke differently, the rest either becomes stronger, and the villains are not as good.\
The anime is pretty cool, plus the fillers are many boring, if you do not get bored and give up anime, skip the fillers.\

A história do anime é boa,o enredo é muito bom,as situações de lutas ou história são boas,a 'humanidade',de alguns dos personagens vão desaparecendo e em outros vai surgindo,e o final eu achei bom por que fez uma especie de ponte para o shippuden.\
Porém existe muita coisa rídicula em Naruto,que são os clichês,exemplo:mulheres,que são homens(não estou falando do sasuke hehe),fillers chatos '-',kakashi modelo(tem vergonha de mostra o rosto),muito maneiro o cara se chamar gai,nos time de três no naruto,praticamente tinha:o mais fodão(Sasuke,Neji,Kakashi,Orochi), era mais fraco que o fodão mais queria ser melhor(Naruto,Lee,Obito,Jiraya) e as mulheres que curavam ferimentos(Sakura,Ino,Rin,Tsunade).\
A animação algumas vezes é muito zuada,mais no contexto geral ela é boa,a trilha sonora é mítica, mais a dublagem é muito ruim.\
Já que tem muitos personagens,alguns tem personalidades iguais,mais os poderes bem diferentes,e os objetivos só tem praticamente o Sasuke de diferente,o resto quer se torna mais forte,e os vilões não são tão bons.\
O anime é bem legal,mais os fillers são muitos chatos,se não quiser ficar entediado e desistir do anime,pule os fillers.\

    Oh my. Naruto. I almost shed a tear when rated it so low, because i wanted it to be any better than what it has become.\
Naruto is for me on of the best anime out there if you only count from episode ONE to NINETY NINE. It has commedy, no romance, action and excelent fights and a great character development for the protagonist and perhaps other \"sub\" characters like gaara for instance.\
The way naruto finds his way to release the \"hidden fox\" inside of him and the way naruto rivals with sasuke who would later become his best friend and enemy is superb.\
In the beggining\
          \
        he is much of a wuss, but he gains strength little by little through tough training and lamen eating... (~datte ba yo ! ^^) and not through inconsistents powerupps !!!\
=== BUT ===\
After episode 99, there're fillers and the story starts to get slowed down so much that one episode would contain half of the last episode in the form of flashbacks and the other half being flashbacks of earlier parts of the SAME EPISODE... until it gets to a point where you would get FULL SEASONS OF FILLERS and the anime starts to get UNWATCHABLE.\
But people tend to forget/ignore this move and that's why he is just another OVERATED series here in anime list.\
So if you rate naruto for only his 99 first episodes (10+++) but as a whole series with 220 episodes in total (3~) we get about 45% of the anime being very good and the whole rest not. \
Naruto still managed to have a sequence as bad (or worst) than its fillers, called Naruto ShiFillerDen...\
Just to finish it, the protagonist has his own name as the title of the series, wich means we can't expect that he will ever die. xD\

Well, first off, yeah this was the first Anime I saw, hence I loved it, but that ended quite horridly some episodes after episode 80, when it started falling, and I mean FALLING from grace, it fell so hard I nearly cried. It started out as a great anime but turned out to be some repetitive piece of crap.(Spoiler) I must say that no anime has had me as close to crying as this one from the things that happened around the Zabuza time(Spoiler). So my advice is\
          \
        to only watch up to about 80. \
(Only for those who have seen it all) :\
What pissed me the most of is when they repeat the EXACT thing that happened around the Zabuza time with that other 'sword dude' who has two swords instead of the gigantic Zabuza one. Everything is the same, just with different skills and abilities. \

    Fun fact: This anime, along with Lucky Star, made me quit anime for quite a few years. Which is a shame, because anime is a very diverse artistic medium. Unfortunately, I made the fallacious assumption that all anime was as dreadful and tedious as Naruto.\
I think the saddest thing about Naruto is the wasted potential. Just think about it-- groups of ninjas fighting each other-- how cool is that? Unfortunately, Naruto doesn't meet this standard of awesomeness in a variety of ways.\
**Story** - 3 (Poor)\
The story really had great potential, but it got mind-numbingly awful really quickly. Countless filler episodes (it seems as if the\
          \
        majority of episodes are filler) destroy the story even more. Most of the \"plot twists\" (if you can call it that) are extremely convoluted and contrived beyond belief (ex., Orochimaru coming back to life countless times for no particular reason just to \"shake up\" the story). Without going into specifics about the story, it didn't particularly do much for me, as it was kind of like: go from point A to point B, then fight, wash, rinse, repeat. I can't go without mentioning the sheer LENGTH of this anime. This actually leads even further to its downfall. I don't particularly mind longer series, but when your anime is 220 fucking episodes long for no particular reason, with half of it being filler, you've got yourself a problem: Who wants to watch 220 dragged out episodes, only about 1/10 of that being ACTUAL ACTION. Half the episodes aren't relevant to the plot, so I SUPPOSE you could skip those, but I don't really like to skip episodes in a series for some reason. Making Naruto even more infuriating for me to watch. /rant over/\
**Art** 6 (Fair)\
Eh, I'm not a stickler for art, so I don't particularly care. Not the most gorgeous art ever, but it'll do, I suppose.\
**Sound** 3 (Poor)\
Again, not really a stickler for music. I don't really care. If it has amazing music, that's another plus. But music isn't centric to the anime experience.\
Now, you're probably asking: well then, why did you give it a 3? Two words: voice acting. Oh my god. Naruto's voice is extremely grating on my ears, and I want to kill myself whenever he says believe it!/dattebayo. It doesn't matter if you're watching sub or dub, Naruto's voice just makes you hate him.\
**Character** 1 (Pathetic)\
Pathetic is exactly the word I'd use to describe Naruto's characters. Naruto is a completely unlikeable main character, due to 1) his voice and 2) the fact that he's extremely fucking annoying and completely cliché-- super special child born with super special power out to save the world! Original Naruto, very original. It seems a huge flaw with the characters of Naruto is that they're completely one dimensional-- they have exactly one facet to their personality. For example:\
Naruto- never gives up\
Sasuke- broody emo guy\
Sakura- completely fucking useless\
Jiraiya- complete pervert\
You get the idea. There *are* some interesting characters that I actually liked, such as Haku and Zabuza. Unfortunately, they aren't around for long and are quickly forgotten, being pretty much pointless to the main story.\
**Enjoyment** 2 (Dreadful)\
What can I say? Convoluted and contrived story, too long, too boring, too many fillers, horrible characters, annoying voice acting, one-dimensional characters. Gah.\
**Overall** 2 (Dreadful)\
Just no. Please, skip Naruto. Just please don't even go there. I hate this series due to the reasons above. I realize I'll probably get flamed to death by Naruto fans, but meh…\

    Oh boy, Naruto. I remember being really into Naruto as a kid. I started watching it again around February to get into Shippuden. And you know what? I loved it. The anime is amazing. Amazing story and characters, amazing soundtrack, the art is good (nothing too special, just good) and really just enjoyable. The plot twists are good, character development feels natural. I really like how characters don't just get powers for no reason and get super powerful out of nowhere. They develop and train gradually which makes it more believable in a sense. But then, at one point, the anime went into 84 episodes\
          \
        of fillers. Now, now, I know some would say \"Then just don't watch them\" in which case I'd say \"But they are still part of the anime!\" In that case, I'd just read the manga. That has no fillers. Really, before the LONG filler period, I'd have given this anime a 9/10. It was amazing. Not super complicated and a bit cliched but I still think it did its things well. Hell, I was okay with the first 20 fillers or something but they got WAY too much after that. It was torture. \
Now, the story is good. Non-filler episodes have a pretty good story. As I said, the plot twists can be pretty good. The pacing can be slow, like that episode when they did a recap of all that happened previously for no reason. I'll admit that this anime can make you feel really sad when it wants to and can make you laugh at other times. But not the fillers. There are few good fillers. Those are indeed funny and can even be alright stories. But most of them are so PAINFULLY cliched. They tend to use the exact some plot points we've already seen. The stories repeat themselves and are dreadfully predictable. The whole filler thing ruined how the original anime should have ended. The characters are also pretty good. However, they can be definetely a bit samey to some people as some complain about a lot of them having tragic backstories (like, A LOT). However, it isn't much of a problem for me as I love a lot of the characters personally. There are some that are pretty weak, though, a lot of whom tend to be female characters (Gosh, Ten Ten sucks, that's just what I wanted to say. Sakura as well) Then the fillers screwed that up.  Most of those characters follow either one of these patterns: dead parents, monster inside, boy turns out to be a girl etc. It's awful really. Which makes the story just good, as well as the characters.\
In terms of sound, Naruto is amazing in that regard. I really like the voice acting and the soundtrack is beatiful. There are a few tracks and voice actors who aren't all that great but it's nothing too serious. The art is generally good, considering the time period. It definetely isn't the best nor does it need to be.\
Overall, Naruto is a good anime. The first half of the anime is amazing, before the whole filler thing started, then it went into crap territory, hence why I had to drop my score by 2 points. That's because there are still some good fillers and the first 20 are bearable and the fact that before them, the anime was amazing (even if they love flashbacks a bit too much).\

    -In this review, I will only be critiquing \"Naruto\" and not \"Naruto Shippuden\"-\
Undoubtedly, one of the most popular anime of the past decade is \"Naruto.\" But how does this series hold up after all these years?\
Our tale starts off with our main protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki. Admittedly, I do like the concept of this character. He is rejected by his fellow villagers with the exception of a few because of circumstances that he himself could not control. This is where I think we find \"Naruto's\" greatest advantage, characters. \"Naruto\" is not about the story per say but more about how the characters interpret the story. This\
          \
        is very apparent in the first episode as the episode focuses more on Naruto rather than the actual ninja world. It is great at setting up characters and developing them. However, I can't say that the story always keeps this afloat. Sometimes, the story feels a bit too forced or unnatural but not to such a high extent. The story is amusing at best but I guess that is fair enough for a shounen. Overall, \"Naruto\" is a story about the ninjas and not really about the ninja world.\
Before we transition into the later half of this review, let me talk about a few minor things. First of all, the art. The art is simple and basic but is good enough. When it comes to animation though it can sometimes be very lacking. Visually, the anime is mediocre. However, in terms of sound, this anime is really good. Just listen to a couple bits of music from this series and you will understand why. \
Here comes the biggest flaw of this anime...filler. The filler is basically when a series wastes an episode on the characters doing things that will never be mentioned again in future episodes or will even have any effect on the story whatsoever. Many people like to underplay this issue but it is very important. Out of the 220 episodes, 89 episodes are considered filler. That means that yu would waste 1780 hours which is approximately 74 days watching filler. Let that sink in, you are completely wasting 74 whole days just watching characters doing nothing significant. Not to mention that the filler is not even entertaining. And it is not just the filler that wastes your time. Plot lines in this anime at certain times will be stretched to 10 episodes when they really should need 2 at most. These problems are what keeps me from giving this anime a 7.\
Final Verdict:\
With filler, this anime earns a 6 from me however luckily since you can find all the filler episodes by searching it up online, it is possible to watch this anime without filler.This anime, without all the fillers, would probably earn a 6.8 from me (still not a 7). It has solid characters and sound. The art is minimalistic but still can look really good at times. The reason why it is not a 7 though is because even without filler, this anime still suffers from stretched out plot lines that really don't have to be that long. And unlike filler, you can't skip them because something big could happen. If you want to watch anime that are shounen, just like \"Naruto\" but without these problems, watch Hunter X Hunter or Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood whom both currently have a 10 from me.\

    I only recently got into anime, and so had the benefit of doing some research before watching the first series of Naruto.  I was able to skip all of the filler episodes, and believe me, nearly 50% of the anime is filler.  So, even though I said above that I've seen all 220 episodes, I've really only watched the canon episodes and a few of the recommended fillers.\
Even so, Naruto was one of those shows that needed to grow on me.  Having previously watched Hunter x Hunter, it took me until after the Ninja Test arc to really get into it because\
          \
        so much of it reminded me of Hunter x Hunter.  Nevertheless, once the two \"test\" arcs parted ways I felt Naruto better eased into its own thing.\
I have the character mark an 8 because when I began the show I only saw Naruto as a whiny brat, but by the end his character really grew on me. Pacing might be a bit slow for some, but I'm one of those people who enjoy back stories and getting to know characters better.  For this reason I still have a few filler \"arcs\" that I've heard were good and might want to go back and watch.\
In the end, I thought the series was highly enjoyable to watch.  I originally was hesitant to only watch the canon episodes, but having done so I'm glad I did.  There are a number of websites that list these.  Since the show is up in part on Netflix and other streaming avenues, I would also recommend finding the wiki on how the episodes divide into arcs.  This helped me get a sense of direction when watching.\

    I tried so hard to like this show I liked the premise (Ya know ninjas) and this was some people's childhoods, but I personally found that's all it really was, some people's childhood. The only good thing about this show I can say is the music, other than that the characters suck the only two I actually enjoyed were Rock lee and Hinata as they had actual personalities outside of Dr.Family issues and Mr.I wanna be the best there ever was. Outside of that the story itself is poorly paced with a lot of nothing just to get a something that somehow still wasn't set\
          \
        up very well which make the simple blunders and contradictions that most other shows can get away with painfully stick out example Chunin exams during the fight sequences the one girl (on rock lee's team) was set up to be smart but proceeds to do the same thing over and over again even though it was proven to be completely ineffective the first time. Overall I watched way too many episodes of this show but I really wanted to like I can't say anything about shippuden because I frankly don't want to watch it after this. I give this a 3 with the tagline of one of those shows that you shouldn't go back to when your older.\

    Naruto was the first anime that I've watched that drew me in of which I was aware of it being an anime. Due to that, I tend to consider Naruto the first anime I've watched, despite this not being true due to the fact that I've watched a bunch of other anime before it, but rather, because due to it I've gotten interested in the medium of anime as a whole. \
I've never really considered Naruto to be incredibly good, but I remember REALLY enjoying it and being into it. I really enjoyed the powers of the characters and the diversity and just the plain\
          \
        multitude of possibility of powers that can be used, as well as for once that a cartoon is trying to present some tragic stories/backstories to their characters. It was, ironic to a lot of the traits Naruto has, is because of the fact it was a serious story. The first of its kind I've ever had experienced. But as Naruto went on and as I got older, Naruto (the franchise) became an obvious botch, where only about 50% of the content moved the story forward due to fillers.\
But what is Naruto at its core?\
Well, Naruto, at its highest points, is a story where the world presents some characters of whose motivations and capabilities are explained quite well, where you can have a character wanting to seek a high political position because they want to be accepted by all the people that have ostracized him through his entire life, or a character that is incapable of learning any sort of special power and decided to train himself physically to a ridiculous extent, just to prove that they can be as strong as everyone else, or a character that decided to become someone's tool for war, simply because said someone were the only parental figure willing to raise them. A lot of the characters have very strong motivations for what they are doing, and that makes them noteworthy and memorable, despite all their annoying/artificial personality traits, the things they've been through and their motivation for the direction they're moving towards is engaging and makes their personality mishaps pretty easy to ignore. \
Naruto at the core of what it tried to be is a meaningful story about people trying to get somewhere in life and how they've suffered. Which is a hard thing to execute, presenting a lot of characters, with different motivations, goals and stories. With all the shortcomings Naruto has, it is hard not to admit that its story was ambitious in the beginning, where a lot of the backstories the characters have been presented with would be enough to create an entire story arc or series just for that specific archetype. This ambition is what made it noteworthy in the beginning. Naruto tried to present a lot of stories at the same time, present a lot of ideas, without really focusing on a singular entity too much which worked both in its favor and in its detriment. What was in its favor was what I've already praised it for, the story at the highest point. \
And the detrimental part was the fact that it has no idea where to go and it tried to present too many characters and ideas. It kept creating powers, characters, motivations and other such things, but as the series progresses, especially in the sequel, the powers simply don't matter and the strategy behind the fights simply starts fading, because of the sheer multitude of powers, and the characters also start taking the back seat and being irrelevant, due to how many of them are currently. In this series however, the effect of this isn't really felt, but it is true that for the most part, the main characters don't and really, can't drive the story forward. This part of Naruto ends with both characters being just one step closer towards their goal, but still pretty far from it since its merely their first. That's very slow for 135 episodes of mostly non-filler.\
Naruto suffers from the fact that it has no idea where to go and what to do after this series. It presents interesting powers, it creates interesting fights the more limitations it has, but the more tools it creates for itself, the less unique it becomes. Naruto wants to present interesting character stories, but it really starts forgetting on the way which characters caught the interest of the fans, and fails to deliver on them and thus manages to drag on, and just present a lot of new characters who don't really drag the story forward since their motivations are now singular or shallow. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't present this at all, but I want you to be aware of this, if you are a completitionist watcher, that Naruto's sequel will downgrade and why it downgrades.\
So I won't drag on just like the Naruto franchise, the story of Naruto tries to present a lot of characters and their motivations and does a fairly good job at it, but in this process the main characters don't get a lot of progression towards the goal they've set up to be. The characters have interesting motivations, backstories and abilities, but their personality outside of all these things is often jarring. The main character is a rambunxious cunt who screams and rants about how much he wants to make his village great again every chance he gets and the other protagonist is an emo kid with a hate filled boner. The action in the series is mostly comprised of presenting a variety of powers and before there aren't a multitude of abilities presenting, also using them in an effective way in order to make up for your gap in your knowledge gap. The comedy in the series is pretty much ranch, with the main character transforming into a naked girl for people to laugh, I guess, or characters acting in really over the top manners such as crying or being overly violent because they were slightly critical of them.\
In terms of production values, Naruto has a good soundtrack but some occasionally poor animation. The soundtrack is memorable because the composer used traditional japanese instruments while combining those with the sounds of more modern instruments, like guitars and drums. This made Naruto sound unique and innovative. And while Naruto's animation can be decent, it occasionally has some random dips in quality, where characters aren't drawn with a consistent level of detail to other points in the series or just because the series doesn't know how to color balance, partly because the series is also old.\
To conclude, Naruto did plenty of things poorly and plenty of things that are worthy of praise. But ultimately would I recommend it? Yes and no. I think it is a good watch if you're intrigued to analyze the series and see what drew interest to it, and why it even started being successful. It has some interesting story arcs and characters because of their motivations and goals. If you're looking for something you want to watch past that, avoid Naruto because it just doesn't know where to go and it is pretty much the definition of a series dragging on. Naruto didn't know where to go and just aimed to present as much content as possible. Naruto was made to sell, not made to please. Which isn't something anybody can deny, with its high amount of fillers or its just general lack of progression for its main characters. But while Naruto was made to sell, it also sold because of some qualities that it indeed did have. It built interesting characters, it created some interesting powers. And it kept doing that, without ever realizing, that series sometimes, also need an overarching plot. Which Naruto while it may not lack, it does not focus on. And while I don't think that I will ever forget Naruto, because you never forget your first time, I don't see how a longwinded story which doesn't have a point and drags on, will keep dragging in new people.\

    Naruto is one of the most famous anime series of all time.(along with One Piece). Its called the number one series ever and is also said to be called a masterpiece. This is not true. Naruto is far from a masterpiece. Is it bad? No. Is is amazing? Far from it. Its just good.\
Storyline7/10-NO SPOILERS-Naruto is a young boy who wants to be the be the best ninja ever by training with his teacher, Kakashi, and his two friends, Sakura and Sasuke. They train toghter and try to become hokage. Naruto and his friends also learn to fight with chakra and fight bad guys. The\
          \
        idea starts off good, and is very enjoyable. However, there are WAY to many filler.(More then half the series is filler). Also, the pacing is very slow. It takes forever for arcs to finally finish. It is enjoyable at times, but does get old.\
Characters4/10-This is the worst part of Naruto. The characters arent that good. Naruto, is annoying. He never gets any better, his jokes get old. Sakura is no better. Shes very weak(she gets better, but still isnt the best). The back storys are enjoyable, but it seems like it came out of a drama anime. Gaara is the best character. Hes very strong, and has a good story. Sasuke is good, like Gaara, but the others arent.(well, neji is pretty good). The characters are bad, not terrible, just bad.(they also never mature).\
Soundtrack9/10-The OST is very good. I find it very enjoyable to listen to. The opening and ending themes are amazing. The battle music is epic. Naruto always had a great soundtrack. The sad music is beautiful. \
Art6/10-The art is fine. The character design isnt that good.(Expect for Gaara). The overall art look is decent. Ive seen better. I never think of it that much, because I never thought of it as amazing art. Just fine. Its good at some moments, however, it can be kinda poor.\
Enjoyment7/10-I did enjoy it. This is a very enjoyable series. The soundtrack is what I enjoyed the most. The music, is just so enjoyable. Its beautiful. This is a anime also full of comedy. The humor is also what made me enjoy it. However, ive seen much more enjoyable series. There are things I didnt enjoy like terrible pacing, and filler. The enjoyment is good, but not great.\
Overall7/10-Naruto was a series I enjoyed. However, its VERY overrated. Its called the best anime ever, but its not. The manga is much better. It cuts of all the fillers, better art, and better pacing. Read the manga. Dont watch the anime. It is good, but not number one.\

    If you are looking for an Anime to watch I highly recommend Naruto. I found something that I was missing my whole childhood. When I started watching Naruto, I was instantly hooked. The characters are all amazing. Each character has his or her own abilities and as you continue to watch the anime, you learn lessons from them that you wouldn't learn in school. Naruto will make you feel all different kinds of emotions.There has never been any show, cartoon, movie etc where I liked all the characters but after watching Naruto that has changed. Naruto has led me to watch other animes and opened\
          \

    I have watched all 137 non-filler episodes of Naruto.\
I first heard about Naruto years ago and after watching Fairy Tail and One Piece  thought I might as well give it a go. For me Naruto is a weird anime because I like the story and most of the characters, but I find it very hard to enjoy watching it. \
Now before I start the review I would like to say that I don't think Naruto is a completely bad anime and can see how people who got into it when they were young would enjoy it. But I'm going to try and be honest\
          \
        in this review.\
Story - 6.5 - \
The story about Naruto, a boy with the Fox demon trapped inside him and because the demon terrorized the Leaf village years ago he becomes a social outcast in the leaf village. Naruto/Naruto Shippuden follows Naruto on his quest to become one on the most powerful ninja in the land (A hokage) to earn the respect of the people in his village.\
 Sounds good right? I thought so too, until the slow pacing and the hundreds of filler episodes came into play. Now, I don't mind a few fillers here and there since they can add to the characters and the setting but when they take up half the episodes it's too much. If done right I might have given the story an 8 or 9.\
Art - 5 - Not too much to say about the art apart from it's very basic and goes from decent - bad - good fight scene - bad - decent ect.....\
 What they needed to do was take the money from the fillers and put it into the art and animation of all the canon episodes.\
Music - 6 - Nothing great but nothing horrible.\
Characters  - \
 - With Naruto - 5.5 - Damn the orange track suit is ugly and his  'believe it' gets more annoying every time I hear it.\
 - Without Naruto - 6.5/7 - I liked  Sakura and Kakashi ever since I saw one episode years ago and Sasuke seemed pretty cool. Most of the others I liked a little more though watching the show but never really got attached to anyone other than Sakura, Kakashi and Sasuke. Every time I saw Naruto I just wanted someone to cut out his tongue and give him a wardrobe change. Orange is not a good color for a  ninja!\
Enjoyment - the first 40 or so episodes and the exams were enjoyable especially when Naruto wasn't yelling 'Believe it'.\
\
Now if they were to redo the show with proper pacing (Fewer fillers. Like One Piece's 59 fillers from 717 episodes (To be honest I want more One piece fillers)) better art and animation as well as remove those enemies that they had to replace because they made them too strong, then I would be likely to give it a watch and would enjoy it. But as it stands now I find it too painful to watch. \
To those people who have the time to spare and want to get some knowledge about Naruto so that you can at least follow along to some extent when your friends talk about Naruto, then watch all 137 non-filler episodes of Naruto.\
Sorry to all those big Naruto fans. I don't hate the show, I just don't think it's good.\

        Over-hyped does not compare to describe this show.  I was looking forward to watching this show, but once I did, I regretted the decision.  I forced myself to watch 68 episodes, thinking I might find something I enjoyed, but I never did.  Most of the characters are horrible in this show.  There is Naruto, who wants to become the Hokage.  However, he does not seem to take it that serious and goofs off most of the time.  Plus, Naruto does not have to work hard because he has the power of the Nine-Tails.  After\
          \
        a while, I think he forgets his long-term goal.  Then there is Sasuke, a one-dimensional emo character, but most of the girls swoon over him.  The worst character in Naruto has to be Sakura.  Besides the always whining and crying, she is also a horrible person.  I do not know how some people defend here characters, but she makes fun of Naruto for being an orphan.  If Mr. Emo would have not told her off about that, she would not have changed her attitude towards Naruto.  Then when the guys are working hard to get stronger, Sakura and Ino are playing with flowers and Sakura asks Ino why boys are like that?  Are these two girls not warriors as well?  Should they not try to become stronger?  Then the scenes of the cutting of the hair, it was too funny.  \
    I would rather watch Dragon Ball Z, then this garbage.  I would recommend Hunter x Hunter (2011) and Katekyo Hitman Reborn!, instead of Naruto. \

    Like is the case for many people, Naruto was one of the first anime that I watched. And like a lot of people who hadn't seen much to compare it with, I loved it! But I grew up with Naruto and as time passed, I did find plenty wrong with it. Now it's a show that I like to make fun of out of love, like an old friend. So with that disclaimer out of the way, let's get to my actual thoughts on it.\
Naruto is seen as one of the most overrated series of all time because to any seasoned anime viewer, it IS\
          \
        average. The artwork can seem subpar, the shear number of filler episodes is terrifying, and certain dub voices can make you cringe. However, there are a few qualities that do make the series special. Not all of the music is great, but there are a few songs that you can't help but be moved by. And with the dozens of songs, you'll never get bored of hearing the same thing. Secondly, there's a great balance between plot, action, and fun time (granted, the humor isn't great, but hey, there's still action and drama, right?). And once you finish wading through the sea of filler, there are the moments that make it all worth it. But sometimes it does feel like work to get to those points, so if you're the type who would prefer an anime that doesn't hold back and jumps straight into an intense storyline, Naruto isn't for you. But if you enjoy a good long show that slowly develops lovable characters, is in no particular hurry to get where it's going (but it will get there), or just want to see an old classic, Naruto might be perfect for you.\
Personally, I may have to watch it again soon myself. After all, this show really did change my childhood and probably made me a better person. I hope it can do the same for everyone else.\

    Naruto means a lot to me, it was a big part of my childhood but here is where i put my personal feelings a side and review it from an objective standpoint.\
The story of Naruto is a bit uneven. On one hand it brings some spectacular and great emotional moments but is brought down by the poor pacing and a lot of fillers. There are episodes with great character development, episodes with spectacle, episodes where nothing happens, episodes with turtle pacing and episodes that have fight scenes that never end. \
The art and animation is alright. Since it is a 220 episode anime the animation\
          \
        budget for each individual episode is not equal. Some episodes look great others dont.\
The soundtrack is really good. It builds up the action and gets me pumped every time. The dub is an okay dub that gets the job done but you are not missing anything.\
The characters are the best thing about Naruto. They are well developed, deep and very well written. They feel human. However the antagonists(excluding Zabuza and Haku) are a bit shallow, while pretty cool looking overall not much to say about them.\
For my enjoyment i can say when its good its GOOD. The chunin exam arc is the best example of this but the fights some times go on forever and filler nightmares dont help that either.\
Overall Naruto is an enjoyable anime. Is it good? Yes. Is it flawed? Yes. Is it worth the hype? NO! Is it worth watching? Only if you are ready to sit through 220 uneven episodes and thats not counting shippuden.\

    Naruto is one of the most famous and most popular animes of all time and it deserves the hype. The story takes place in a world where ninjas are very powerful and are a valuable and necessary government resource. The story centers around a young, ambitious, over-zealous boy named Naruto Uzumaki. Naruto dreams of becoming a very strong, formidable ninja and one day The Hokage (The leader of Naruto’s village. The Hokage must be, if not one of, the most powerful ninjas in the village). However Naruto is ostracized because of the fact that inside him is the nine-tailed fox spirit that was sealed inside\
          \
        of him after it attacked the village and killed many ninjas around the time of Naruto’s birth.\
Upsides\
Naruto is one of the most famous and most popular animes of all time and it deserves the hype. Naruto is filled with many intense, dramatic battle scenes against enemy ninjas and has many likeable charismatic characters that you are guaranteed to fall in love with. Furthermore, Naruto has an always interesting, ever-changing storyline that goes far beyond fight scenes i.e., Naruto’s love/hate relationship with Sasuke who is a naturally gifted ninja that is always pushing Naruto to do better. Naruto and co. also offer a substantial amount of humour to go along with the stellar action and spectacular story.\
Downsides\
There aren’t many downsides to Naruto. That being said, there are some. One of the most prominent flaws being the slow pace, for example, the fist arc which really isn’t much more than an introduction to the main characters lasts about 15 episodes.\
A big, but avoidable problem is the number of fillers. Alost 90 of the 220 episodes have no relevance to story are frankly, garbage. Luckily, thanks to the wonderful resource that is the internet, one can easily find which episodes are fillers and subsequently, skip them. But if you are a hard core Naruto fan and sitting through hours of episodes that have nothing to do with the story, there is nothing wrong with that.\
At first glance, the young ages of most of the main characters may turn a few people away. It never actually states how old Naruto is but he appears to be about 10ish. But it really is irrelevant. Before long you will be indifferent to the ages of the kids.",

    When this show started off I loved it. I loved every episode, the action was great, and it had some interesting story development. But then the show went on and as it went I spiraled down fast. Naruto himself got annoying, Sakura got frustratingly moany about Sauske, and Sauske turned out to be an arse. But the thing that really turned me off to the show fastest was the story line and how they were trying to get that laugh, and mostly just pandering to the age group that finds fart jokes funny. It got really irksome when an entire mission/story ark gets completely destroyed\
          \
        when Naruto rips one (I'm looking at you Bikochu Beetle). The show still has some amazing fight sequences, and the overall concept shows that it could have been an amazing anime, if it had only decided to step out of the kiddy grades and not try to make us laugh at lame humor. \

    Naruto is really typical, it seems like one of those infamous series you hear about all the time, so you tend to watch it to satisfy your own curiosity.  It's not as bad as some people claim, yet I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever watched.\
Story: Here's the thing with the story of Naruto, it's really a good plot, it is, minus the fillers that is.  Once the fillers kick in, the whole enjoyment aspect of it just fully decreases.  I'm rating the story aspect of it based on the story itself, not the fillers, hence why I said it was\
          \
        very good.  The rating for this anime would really improve if they did it in seasons.  Sure, the thought of waiting months for the next arc is a bit frustrating, but at least the fans would get something worth watching.\
Art: Nothing really to say about art, it's really typical so I wouldn't say it stands out.  \
Sound: Most of the opening and closing seem to fit appropriately with the genre of the anime, same goes for the background music used in the anime.  Character's voice all fit nicely with their respectively characters, which helps to bring out their unique personality.\
Characters: The characters themselves are average, like most series, they all tend to wear the same clothes all the time, probably to better acquaint you with them.  What I'd like to comment about is the use of skills, at first you see their unique skills and you find it really exciting, but some of them are really getting overused (Naruto's Rasengan), this again, leads back to the fillers.  If there were less fillers, their wouldn't be a need to do such a thing and fans wouldn't get so sick of seeing the same skills over and over again.\
Enjoyment: I did enjoy it, but you have to look at it as a whole, which means in the presence of the fillers, in which case my enjoyment decreased as each episode goes by and getting frustrated at seeing Naruto's Rasengan for the billionth time really didn't help either.    \
Overall: A good anime consists of many different aspects, each must come together nicely for the series to be successful and for a good rating.  Naruto lacks in some areas, and no surprise, the ratings are what it is.  I'd still recommend it to those who wishes to enjoy all anime like I do, but for those easily frustrated by long series, this is not for you.\

    Well, well here's Naruto. Oh joy. OK before I start reviewing this I would like to point out that this is a review and therefore it will contain the personal opinions of the person in cause, me. What was the point of me saying that, one may wonder? Well, simply put, it's due to the fact I'm well aware of Naruto's huge popularity and therefore I'm certain a lot of people that will read this review will, probably, find themselves frustrated of what will they consider of me being completely devoid of any taste in anime for not realizing the geniousness of this anime. Now\
          \
        with that outta the way let's head on the review. What's most important for any anime? Of course the story. I'll be direct and say that the story , in my case, is nothing short of dreadful, and therefore get's the 2 thumbs up from me. It's based around a kid, who so happens to have lost his parents, and therefore is an orphan, and the challenges he'll face in his quest to become the greatest ninja in his village, which is called Hokage by the way. Seems simple but yet intriguing now doesn't it. Well so have I though till I actually gave it a watch. To my surprise the story falls flat on it's face from the very first episodes. This is mostly due to the story itselfs being in contradiction with the world in which it develops or maybe the other way 'round. The plot device here is the ninja world. However in Naruto's world, the ninjas seems to be the inverted version. Where a ninja has to be stealthy and calculated, here most ofem shout, scream, jump head-on in a confrontation and apparently don't even bother wearing proper uniform, something to help disguese them, instead prefering to walk around in  bright colors so that everyone may notice them. Art get's a 5. All I can say bout it is that it was good but overuse of recycled scenes made it eem cheap and there less enjoyable to watch as the series progressed. Sound get's the 6. It's great that's for sure but unfortunately it suffers from the same problem  as the art of the show. As the series progressed the soundtracks ued got cut down untill eventually they ended up recycling 4-5 more memorable soundtracks for every episode that followed while the others went into complete obscurity. Character. Oh boy. 1. I really feel sorry for their characters. Aside from the main characters the rest are underdeveloped and bland, and some go as far as succumbling to certain stereotypes. Example: A fat guy in one group that thinks alwys 'bout food, eats all the time, and oh wait he can also use a technique which makes him even fatter. Yeah, if that's the idea of a character of a comedic value than to Naruto's misfortune it's long overdue. And ther re lots more. Smart kid who is too smart to even bother, kid who ties to win his crush over by standing up to the guy who seems to popular, guy too popular but who doesn't care about anything etc. And the list could go on. To underdevelop a character is one thing but to completely throw out the window the ntion of balance between is completely another. And again, while this is bad, Naruto seems to excel at this. Main characters get stronger by learning new powers while old ones are stuck with the very powers they started with and as the enemies appearing get stronger  and stronger the only thing these side characters end up showing is how useless they've become or are becoming. And the main character is also a reason the whole show falls. His annoying and completely unlikeble. Ok Naruto we get it that you're an orphan and despite that you have the guts to stand up to the injustice that life's done you and pursue your dreams but that isn't a reason to keep remnding us this every episode. And also the sheer amount of positivity in this guy in contrast with how he behaves is something that is completely unrealistic. The choice in doing such a character also limits his development possibilities which in turn diminishes the viewers interste in even following this character. He's not worth it. You already know he has a strong belief in the morale values he upholds and , therefore, regardless of watever challenges he faces he'll always pull it off 'cuz of his strong beliefs. But his constant reminder of this aspect of him really makes unlikeble due to the fact that after a while it gets anoying and can't help but give a weird sensation that the show is just trying to scold you and shove it's morale lessons down your throat. With this said I can only state that I hardly enjoyed Naruto and to put it in a nutshell, it gets a 3 on the Enjoyment meeter but that's only due to moments of amusement from how ridiculous this whole show is and of how hard it tries to be serious. Overall I give it a 2. The art and sound doesn't save the show from me giving it a 2 due to the fact that, as well as they might be, the whole experience is poor. Final score for Naruto: 2\

    Naruto....what everyone is always screaming about. Oh and don't forget this... 'Believe it!' Well...the story's..ok is that it kinda gets repetitive and it gets off track, the art is aazing, you can practicly see every single detail in the background and on the bodys! The sound is also great because you can hear al the footsteps, rain drops, hitting and everything! the characters are...pretty bad cause thei're always like mutanta or someone that wants revenge or someone thats completely discombobulated or ANNOYING! (I'm looking at you Naruto) The enjoyment is also fair because like I said it gets repetetive and kinda boring but then suddenly\
          \
        soething amazing happens and its always all talk and talk and talk an... *snore* So overall I would give it a 7. You should watch it but not be all obsessed in it.\

    At first, I thought it'll turn out to be a good anime since it was common. But, I was wrong.\
The character development isn't as great, since Naruto starts as having a dream to become Hokage and goes through several missions and at the end of the series, what did it turn out to be? Having a dream of becoming Hokage once more. Meanwhile, Sasuke's dream is to kill someone that he's been willing to kill, and at the end what does he do? Search for the person to kill him. And it really does not make sense whatsoever. Ninjas are dreadful creatures of the hidden,\
          \
        but I only watched this just to get more of a favor for ninjas and what do I get? More dislikes for ninjas. My ideal for ninjas was a positive manner until I watched all 220 episodes of this, praying and hoping for it to be at least positive. But I was wrong, there was no hope into continuing it to the second season. But, unlike my selfish self, I decided to. It was the worst decision in my entire life.\
What I believe is that this anime isn't pointed directly to teenagers. It's pointed directly to little kids that haven't had a taste in good anime or cartoons yet. \
Character development was poor, story was filled with filters (so much that I got lost), art was decent due to the fighting scenes being all nice and stuff, but the drama in between it... It's annoying. The sound was decent, the enjoyment was alright. Reason being is: The only thing that I was enjoying out of this was my laughter. How funny it is to see someone else being more dramatic than my surroundings in reality. Making me reminiscent. If you're one of those people who takes anime seriously, then you'd probably crash with anger by the time you hit Episode 10-22.\
It was a naive anime, but it isn't pointed directly towards the older audience.\

    Naruto is may favorite anime series and manga series.  I started reading the manga when I was a pre-teen but dropped it after a while, because certain story elements bothered me (such as Naruto's unrelenting love for his rival).  However, when I was 17 I picked it up again because I was bored and had nothing to read, I was hooked all over again, part 2 starts slow but it picks up, and when I say that I mean it gets extremely epic and interesting.  But this review is about Part 1, and the anime adaption of it.\
Well, part 1 Naruto tells\
          \
        the story of a young Tom Sawyer-ish trouble maker kid who wants to be a ninja.  It doesn't take long for him to graduate ninja school and begin his journey to become a legendary shinobi, however it's not just Naruto to watch this show for, the supporting cast and antagonists, especially in Part 1, are what make this story shine.  Some of the most beautifully sad stories I've ever read/seen (in this case seen) are depicted within this anime, and it's just an amazing story that no one should miss.  It enthralled me as a child, and astounded me as an adult, the level of thought, symbolism, and hidden details within this story could only be crafted by geniuses, which would be Kishimoto and his editors.\
All the characters are interesting, have unique personalities, sometime horrific pasts and secrets, and a good lot of them are extremely likable, such as everyone's favorite teacher Kakashi or the goofy underdog with passion Rock Lee.  Even some of the most menacing antagonists you'd never think you'd care about, suddenly show that even they are worth your empathy.  There's a good reason this is the biggest hit anime series to sweep america, and that's due to the overwhelmingly strong story, characters, and masterfully orchestrated soundtrack.\
Now, sure it's amazing, but there are negatives, most which are exclusive to the anime adaption and not the manga.  While the anime adaption does a great job portraying the most important scenes, with fantastic animation and great music placement and sound, the entire thing isn't this way.  This is because different directors and animation teams worked on different parts of the show, so one director could be brilliant, and one could have a lower budget and not be so brilliant, thus the art and execution are inconsistent in areas.\
That's not the only negative however, this show has these annoying things called fillers, which are additional story arcs added on that weren't part of Kishimoto's original manga.  These are pretty cheesy and badly written and should be skipped, except for a particular comedic episode about attempted to remove Kakashi's mask.  If you want to enjoy the show to it's full potential these should be skipped, especially the huge lot of them towards the end.\
Another thing is censorship.  In the manga, there are some scenes that are just far to graphic for whatever timeslot the anime aired in Japan, such as a particular scene where a rogue shinobi is has naked corpses hung on the walls and is removing their limbs and dissecting them.  Scenes like this are replaced with stuff that's less graphic but still sorta gets the point across.\
It's a shame such a great anime with a strong soundtrack and legendary source material has such blaring issues, but that's what bumps it down to a 9, it isn't a perfect adaption, has inconsistent art (but great at times) and various other annoying changes or additions that hamper my enjoyment of the Naruto manga in motion.\
I recommend skipping the fillers for the best viewing experience, but regardless, this is a story you won't forget, with characters you won't forget, moments you won't forget, and feelings you won't forget.\
There's no score more appropriate for this show other than a 9/10.\

    This is my first review. I hope I don't come off as too much of a jerk.\
I watched quite a bit of anime before I watched Naruto. I have had some beautiful high points while watching (FMA Brotherhood) and some disappointing lows (SAO). Sadly Naruto was one of those lows.\
Story: 4\
Repeat after me: FILLER EPISODES!\
This was the worst for me. I usually binge watch anime, so sometimes watching 3+ episodes in a row where the plot made next to no progress became a little mind numbing. Not only that, but the main story line was just kind of boring. I never felt entertained by it.\
          \
        Most of the entertainment I got was either unintentional or just basic slapstick humor.\
Art: 5\
I've seen better and I've seen worse.\
Sound:7\
The sound is great. The themes set the scene well, and the Japanese voice acting is great. I don't have any experience with the dubbed version however.\
Character: 5\
I hate Sakura and Sauske. They are crappy, underdeveloped characters that are whiny and annoying. It's a shame that they are main characters. Naruto is okay. The only characters I liked were Shikamaru and Rock Lee. To directly quote my friend Matt, \"Rock Lee is a badass. Everybody wishes they were Rock Lee.\" The only reason he watched Naruto was to cheer on his boy Lee.\
Enjoyment: 4\
Wow. When it comes down to it, I only finished the series to put it on My Animelist. There, I said it. Even Rock Lee wasn't enough to save this show. I honestly didn't enjoy it too much.\
Overall: 4\
Needs moar Rock Lee.\

    Earlier I wrote a review on Naruto, but I deleted it because I felt I didn't go into much detail, now I will review Naruto in broader detail than before. \
Masashi Kishimoto is one of the many artists to be inspired by highly popular manga/anime series Dragon Ball, like the other two of the \"Big Three\"; Bleach and One Piece. Dragon Ball is one of the most influental anime series ever created, a story of a boy named Son Goku who wants to be strong and be there for his friends while defeating the baddies with peserverance, courage,& a sufficent amount of training, simple yet\
          \
        incredibly groundbreak. So here, I'll compare Naruto to Dragon Ball.\
Story- Naruto follows a very similar formula of those of Dragon Ball Z(as well the same pacing), though one thing should be known, the concept isn't very original: \"A pucky, young boy who longs to become the best ninja there is by becoming the next Hokage, & doing their job better than they've ever dreamed to\". That concept has been used so many times on a Shonen, so Naruto is another coming-of-age anime,& the biggest question, does it deliever? You bet, it may not be too out-of-the-box or defining, but it does give us good settings,& nice built-up though it has many pointless flashbacks, it balances in the themes of friendship, trust, batrial, vengenase,& never giving up very well, like the way Team 7 worked together and truimphed through their missions was something to behold.....but all that takes a backseat after Sasuke disbands from the squad and the series no longer feels like the very entertaining coming-of-age series we used to know but became more like a shallow and boring sob-story. \
Art and Animation- Nothing to brag about here, the character designs are poorly-drawn, have poor palleting, there's so many errors(but hey, atleast Naruto looks cool),& they're very generic, but it's quite different for the manga as it looks infinitly better,& back on topic: The animation is very choppy, one moment it's fluid but in another it's cheap(compare Naruto vs. Kiba(cheap) to Lee vs. Gaara(fluid)) , it's not the same to say for Dragon Ball as it was well-animated for it's time period although some scenes in there looked cheap. The Opening and Ending sequences look fantastic though.\
Sound- Top-notch here, top-notch. The voice-actings fit the character's personality very well, DUB AND SUB, but one character's voice-actor I'd like to complain about and that's Sasuke's, the guys who voice him are atleast in their 30's, when Sasuke is 12-years old, Junko Takeuchi(who voices Naruto Uzumaki in the Japanese version ) might have been more fitting for his 12-year old body than Noriaki Sugiyama,& the dialogue is unnatural at times. Othere than that, I applaud the performance. As for the soundtrack, it's one of the best I've ever heard in an anime, they enhance the events,& really fit the atmosphere of the show, really worthy of importing. This is one category Naruto handles better than Dragon Ball. \
Characters- Well not being as likable or well-defined as Dragon Ball characters, they are still very-well developed(for the most parts), the characterization is handled much like Dragon Ball as they grow physically and mentally. Though a lot of people find them annoying, I don't mind most of them really but I don't agree they're one of the deepest and most well-characterized. One character I feel is complete waste and shouldn't be around is Sakura Haruno, she's the Krillin of Naruto but not as memorial, although she does vouch to be more helpful but she does not fullfill that prophecy untill Shippuden,& she's generally extremely annoying,& she's unbearable to look at. The characters are your typical Shonen archetypes: Naruto is the hyper-active kid yearning to be the best of the best, Sasuke is a rival of Naruto,& Sakura....she's a b!tch and doesn't do much more than lust for the rival. \
Enjoyable- I'm not gonna lie, I really did enjoy this series, granted it's not even close to being one of the best animes out there, I don't think it's even a candidant for it. The first 100 or so episode are amazing, it has amazing fight choreography, atlmost on par with what you've seen with DBZ, but the rest...not so much, that's where all the fun stops, I'll admit the comedy filler episodes were a breath of fresh air but still.\
\
Positives:\
+ Decent story \
+ Stunning Opening and Ending Sequences\
+ Top-notch voice-acting\
+ Top-notch music\
+ Well-defined Characters\
+ Easy to get into\
+ Cool Fight Scenes\
Negatives:\
- Overall weak Art and Animation\
- Not original\
- Filler Episodes\
- Overabundant Flash-back scenes\
- Sakura Haruno\
\
Final Verdict:\
Without the filler episodes, it may have gotten an 8 or 9, but the series is perfect if you wanna get into anime as it's not hard to follow. And if you like Shonens(primarly action-packed ones like DBZ and Yu Yu Hakusho), defintely watch it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. :)\

    ok, let's be honest, most people who are into anime have heard in some way shape or form about naruto that it's either the greatest anime ever or its garbage. well it's neither of those things so let's talk about it. naruto is about a young ninja's journey to become the leader of his village someday and we get to see that growth through part one and then into shippuden (of which i will write my review on it later)\
pro's of naruto\
1. excellent characters\
- the thing about naruto compared to alot of other anime's out there who have well written characters and sometimes even very\
          \
        well written and also relatable. naruto has both. most of the characters in naruto have extremely unique personality's that  will appeal to a wide arrange of people and some might even be able to relate to more then one character. and more often then not if your end up liking this anime you'll probably be thinking at some point \"why don't i get to this such and such character more\" it happens alot and sadly there are a couple characters i wish we would have gotten to see less of (sakura) and more of (neji,hinata, asuma). to go along with their unique personalitys they are come with their own unique skill sets making most of the characters to be special and strong in certain area's (except sakura, no i am not trying to trash this character i actually like sakura but she doesn't do much in part one despite the fact she's the main heroine).\
2.solid fighting\
- the fighting scenes in the show do start off fairly slow but they do get much better with each episode to show how the characters fighting and skills improve.\
\
3. excellent storytelling\
- there is a solid main story here that is always pretty on target to reaching a certain point and it does keep you invested throughout the show. even though there is alot of filler (AHAHAHAHA) even some of that is interesting and somewhat needed\
4. soundtrack\
-the feels\
\
cons\
\
1.filler\
-iam going to go ahead and say that i don't hate filler but naruto does WAY OVER DUE IT. some filler is needed in order to explain many of the backstorys with certain characters which is fine but more often then you'll feel as if its a complete waste of time\
2.flashbacks\
-way to many in part one, we get it this certain thing happend we don't need to see it 5 fucking times\
3.artwork\
-in some episodes its great others not so much\
4.wasted potential of a main character\
-SAKURA HARUNO\
5.some parts could be explained more in part one but are just kinda swept aside.\
\
overall this is a good anime, one of my favorites because i grew up with it, i reccomend everyone at least TRY it and if you don't like it you don't like it.\

It didn't make me want to take a cold shower after watching, but it wasn't very good either. It had some nice visuals for it being from 2002\

You gotta watch Naruto. It has a total of 220 episodes but without fillers it's around 100.\
( skip the fillers, the good ones are in Shippuden, not here )\
First off, you're gonna know the name of everyone from his village which is pretty cool to begin with.\
You'll find the hand seals pretty satisfying and most characters come out as very cool and chill.\
Each character brings something very significant to the table.\
The action is epic and it's pretty funny at times. The walk through Naruto's life is emotional occasionally but really gets you motivated, dattebayo! \
The protagonist Uzumaki Naruto defies limit time and time again,\
          \
        it's heartwarming. Story of Uchiha Sasuke is one you'd not wanna miss.\
With that said, you must watch Naruto Shippuden too, 500 Eps but less than 350 without fillers, though some are good.\
Shippuden is just sooo much better.( flashbacks are outrageous )\
I'd say Naruto is the ladder to get to the real deal that is Naruto Shippuden but don't get me wrong, Naruto is not to be underestimated. \
There are two fights which are on par with the greatest fights in Narutoverse.( You'll understand once you see them )\
The hype for villains is unparalled \
The OP's( Opening Sequences ) are pretty dope too!.\
I hope you actually get into the Narutoverse coz of my elaborate recommendation. I believe i have hyped it enough for you without any spoilers, although with spoilers his would have been 4x easier.\
Enjoy Watching !\

    This is my first review, and i want to start with one of the most known anime shows, \"Naruto\" that was aired in 2002 by TV Tokyo . This review is going to be short and to the point with no spoilers and i will talk about my opinion on fillers and the show.\
Lets start !\
For me \"Naruto\" is one of my favorite anime shows,i was watching the series when i was kid and maybe that's why the final score might be influenced than you may expect it to be.  I have read the manga too and i must say that the art is\
          \
        amazing, the story is outstanding and you can easily figure out the personality of the characters.\
The story overall is very good, intense with a lot of fighting, and very dramatic scenes.\
Every character has some unique super power, which differentiates them from each other making the combat scenes more dynamic(in some of the cases) and more intense.\
The evolution of the main characters are very well highlighted and i bet you will love some of them.\
You will find a lot of comic scenes in the series.\
The music/sound in the anime is good and it gives you the feeling of ninja combat and it greatly accentuates the dramatic scenes.\
(I would like to recommend you to watch it with the audio in japanese, i don't know but it kinda gives you that feeling of ninja combat and for me its sounds much better, but its your choice and you must choose what fits you)\
Lets now go to the fillers, and yes , i know many of you don't like them or not going to like them, they just, repeat, and repeat, and repeat, and repeat... (Maybe that's why the score of the anime is so small)\
The fillers are trying to give you a much deeper understanding of the situation/characters from different perspectives. And i think its also reminding you things that happened in the past,  and i think this is good for someone that stopped watching the series for some time.\
And yes,  i know that they are trying to get more out of it ($$$), bla bla bla.... but i think that you need respect the series and the work that the guys are doing.\
So this are my scores :\
Story : 8\
Art : 9\
Sound : 10\
Character : 9\
Enjoyment : 9\
Overall : 9\
I may not be a good critic or reviewer but this is my short opinion about this anime show.\
I hope you will find this helpful !\

    This is going to be my first review so bear with me.\
I started watching Naruto when I was extremely young and it was still on going, so I already have some kind of attachment to the show and it's characters yet I ended up dropping it because of all the fillers and never had the courage to pick it back up until a couple months ago.\
Story (7) : The story is fairly easy to understand, ninjas learning to become better ninjas and dealing with their own personal problems in the way. It's not anything of out of this world but it still manages to keep\
          \
        your attention and wanting to know what happens next.\
Art (8): Considering Naruto was first aired in 2002, the art is pretty good, specially during the fights where you can see their faces going all over the place which only intensifies it.\
Sound (10): The soundtrack is beyond amazing, it has for me has one of the best openings and endings, but besides that the music they use to amplify a characters emotions really does make you feel for them.\
Characters (9): If there's one thing it's known for it's the thousands of characters there is, when I first watched it I didn't give value to it and only cared about one of the main edgy guys but after re-watching I found myself feeling for most of the characters and relating to their situations. It's extremely diversified.\
Enjoyment (8): The main story really did grab me in and didn't let go until I finished, I cried, I laughed, I face palmed but in the end it really did stick with me and it always will. \
Overall (7): In the end, I gave Naruto a  7 because even though I loved it for the most part if there's something I couldn't stand was all the fillers. It's an amazing anime, I totally recommend it but I don't recommend it's fillers and specially not in the amount they offer.\

    It's my first time review so go easy on me and I don't want to drag this review long,after all we are talking about Naruto here Most Popular Shonen anime :XD\
NARUTO a typical shonen Anime with lots of fight,drama and comedy,i only watched till episode 135 that is where original storyline ends,And few filler arcs worth totally 20 episodes.\
There is nothing to say more about Naruto,it's already pretty popular and same as all other shonen animes,some times it drags a little like in \"sasuke recovery mission arc\" \"konoha crush arc\" but it's shonen anime after all, what can you expect?\
Art quality are not that great\
          \
        either but sound is quite good,as for the storyline and characters that is what motivates me to watch this series.\
If you are fan of action and long running anime then it's for you.\
I'm not Good At writing reviews so I end it here and sorry for my bad English too, thanks for reading :D\

Here I come Shippuden ;)\

    I was shocked that the rating for Naruto was lower than 8.0. Everyone acts like this anime is the best thing since sliced bread. It's not awful, but it's not great.\
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
Plot/Story: 5/10 I love the concept of Naruto. I love the whole \"multiple people have these beast inside of them\" thing. In a way it's original. You don't see many ninja anime's. This anime has made me laugh and cry. So that's a plus. However, there's the whole filler thing. No one likes fillers. Especially when 40% of the anime is made up of them.  Shippuden had a way better plot/story. \
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
Art: 7/10 Decent\
          \
        art. Not great, but not bad.\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
Sound: 9/10 I love the openings and endings. Great dub and sub voices. I was really impressed with the dub voices. \
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Characters: 5/10 Let's just talk about Sakura for a second. I feel that her character is BEYOND useless. Like what is she even doing? She stands on the sidelines like some confused cheerleader at a football game. Sasuke and Naruto basically did all the work. I just do not like her character. She was annoying and annoying and guess what else? Useless. Naruto was a good character. I liked him. Sasuke was Sasuke. The \"villains\" were interesting. Not much character development though. I wasn't really hyped about any of the characters. I guess that's what Shippuden is for. \
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
Overall: 6/10 I would recommend watching if you want a good laugh or cry. I would re-watch it if I was really bored.  \

    Before I watched Naruto, I thought it looked pretty lame. I now realize I was speaking out of ignorance more than anything. I was basing my inferences on the crappy commercials from cartoon network. MAKE SURE TO WATCH THE SUBBED VERSION. \
Story - Naruto possess an amazing story. I found myself getting all teary eyed a bunch of times as I watched it. Quite embarrassing. The one flaw is that they over use the flashback technique. They show memories that make you feel all sad. The first time you watch Naruto this won't bother you, but if you intend to re-watch it, it becomes extremely\
          \
        annoying and tiresome. I found myself skipping huge chunks of the anime the second time around.\
Art - One word explanation. Great.\
Sound - Almost all of the music is great. Some of the intro songs are bad though. Like the first OP song. 'I wanna rocks, rocks to the chest.' What the hell does this mean? I don't know.\
Overall Naruto is a great show. The biggest flaw is the enormous amount of fillers. Stop watching after about episode 135 because there is no more plot development, just a whole load of crap.\

    I first heard about this anime when I was at Hot Topic looking for cheap T shirts.  The scary man working there with big holes in his ears had a cool head band with a squiggle on it.  I thought it was neat and asked him about it.  After listening to him rant about how the show changed his life for about 20 minutes, immediately went home and started watching it.  At first I thought the show was for kids, but  then characters started dying and (spoiler alert) Sasuke left the village I cried for days.  The story is\
          \
        great, the art is great (some of the best fight scenes I have ever seen in an anime), the sound is great, the enjoyment is great and the overall is great.  I try to tell my friends about it, but they usually just ignore me and just watch crappy shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones.  My friends don't really talk to me anymore, but i talk to lots of e friends on anime forums, so I'm better off anyways!  I LOVE THIS SHOW!\

    All right, first review on the site, and probably not the last one. I remember that a friend of mine suggested to watch the series, then I started. It wasn't bad, but sometimes I feel it's boring. The Chuunin Exam was pretty good, and that's where I decided to keep on watching the series. Right now I'm watching the Shippuuden, but currently it's on hold until it reaches a point that I found interesting in the manga. *cough* Jiraiyavspain *cough*\
Some fight scenes are memorable, but they are pretty rare in that many episodes. Talking about many episodes, Naruto might have the slowest story from all\
          \
        the animes I know. Sometimes I wish I would skip some parts, and sometimes I did: like I skipped the whole filler on the end of this series.\
Now let's talk about the characters. There are characters you can easily like, and characters you can easily hate. I still don't understand why are there so many Sasuke fans, while he's the worst emo I have ever seen. However I like Shikamaru, his fights always has a twist near the end, and I actually liked Lee before his injury. After that: umm, just strange. =)\
Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad series, but it could be better at some points. Skip the fillers, and have some fun. And remember: ninjas are always cool ... except if they are from Naruto.\

    I must insist, to read the manga. The anime sucks and I was totally disappointed. Everyone's voice was different. I imagined Naruto's to be more hyperactive, Hinata's less whispery, Sasuke's less mature....The Manga was an absolute masterpiece by Kishimoto and the Anime totally ruined Naruto's reputation. The first opening theme as you all know is crap, consists mostly of shouting than singing. \
I can understand why everyone hates Naruto. I did too as I read to Manga first and place so much HOPE that Naruto will be a success. The manga was so much better than the anime, there was more detail and everything was\
          \
        from the imgination and genius of Kishimoto. I thought the anime was created by martins at the lack of genius. But at least the storyline and plot still creates a somewhat suspense. \
I ask everyone now, to read the naruto Manga, the original, created by Kishimoto than crappy anime by MADMAN TM. The Manga was a masterpeice and kept my obsession alive.\

    If you have a friend, or better yet a group of em', always criticising your anime indulging existence. Fret not, convert them. Throw this at their faces and if all goes well (it did, for me) theyll be begging you for more.\
A boy that is destined to be hated for life, alone and sad forever. Naruto shows that no matter what kind of society that you in and no matter what is thrown against you, you are the key that makes it better for yourself. Written down in a world where ninjas and inner spirit power (Chakra) takes place, it opens up a new way\
          \
        of how we or should i say, i, look at ninjas.\
Forbidden techniques, country-colonizing, 3 man teams. You wont know what ninjas really do after you watch this. Sadly, to me it kind of lost a great deal of fans. A year long series-killer, fillers. Yes. It started off to be quite entertaining but before long, the episodes were like aired as though it was just to keep it going while the manga side runs on.\
Then, life breathes back into the series it when it was announced that the original manga published stories were set to be aired as a second part of naruto with a timeskip, featuring a grown up naruto's generation and apparently new quality of episodes. Check for Naruto: Shippuuden.\

    I originally refused to watch the Naruto series all together simply because the characters appeared annoying and childish to me.  I eventually tried watching it and failed the first and second time.  I eventually saw the fight scene between Naruto and Sasuke on youtube and this allowed me to give the series more of a chance.  I rather liked it. \
This is one of the harder series to write a review for due to the sheer length of it.  There are too many recaps throughout episodes; these take up sometimes 10-15 minutes of a 23 minute episode which is rather annoying.\
          \
         Filler episodes are also littered throughout the series which can be beneficial or annoying depending on how many and how bad/good each episode is.  The last 40 episodes consist of about 20 filler episodes which was horrible.  The length also gives it several benefits character development is one of the most notable (Maybe not for Sakura…).  Character growth and evolvement is visible in many of the main and supporting characters especially Naruto and Sasuke.\
The animations throughout the series are solid and there are several instance of using unique art styles to help enhance fight sense and humor.  The voice acting is well done but, the dialogue can be very cheesy at time, making one possibly slam their face into a wall.\
Naruto is an exciting series that has a solid and creative storyline complimented with excellent character development.  Regardless of any shortcomings previously mentioned Naruto is a solid series and worth watching.  It also has some of the best fight scenes in anime.",

Critic's Log - Earthdate: July 27, 2012. Review #15: Naruto\
ALRIGHT! Let's get right into Naruto!\
Naruto Uzamaki is a boy who is feared and loathed by the villagers in the Hidden Leaf Village. This distrust of the boy is not because of whom he is, it is because of what is inside him and causes anxiety on fellow villagers. Before Naruto was born, a great Nine - Tailed demon fox attacked the Hidden Leaf Village with monstrous fury and power, this Demon Fox took many lives. The Fourth Hokage arrives, and The Fourth Hokage was the strongest shinobi in\
          \
        the hidden Leaf village at the time and he bravely fought the Nine-Tailed Fox and the battle was won by the Fourth Hokage as he sealed the demon fox in a newborn baby boy after sacrificing his own life. As Naruto grows, he decides that he wants to become the village's strongest ninja in an effort to show everyone that he is not what they perceived him to be; but is a human being worthy of love and admiration. The road of becoming Hokage however will be a long and difficult one. It will be a path full of betrayal, pain, and sorrow. But with hard, Naruto might be able to achieve the title of Hokage.\
To be technical, this is a Studio Pierrot production and they have a pretty good resume if you look up on what animes they have produced past and since Naruto. This show was a big hit in both Japan and in the US, although the US had its issues when it first aired. Japan obviously aired it the way you see it now on DVD, we citizens of the United States saw it on TV in Edited fashion (Obviously censored so kids can watch it). I used to watch Naruto's censored version and trust me... it is 10 times better uncut, Believe It! *I get punched in the face for saying \"Believe It\"* \"OW! What was that for!?... Hello?” Back to the review... Of all the animes I have seen, Naruto is one of those animes that I have a hard time reviewing. The show is watchable because its story is ok for the most part; It is definitely flawed to say the least. Let me just state my opinion on the story arcs to follow... Here I go. Also, there's slight spoilers when I mention the arcs, but I won't give out the major plot points. \
The Introduction Arc - It's nice for starters\
The Land of Waves Arc - Pretty Good\
The Chunin Exam Arc - It builds up and starts getting interesting, the fights after are awesome until...\
The Invasion of Konoha Arc - The Fights are interrupted, but the stakes start going through the roof. Naruto and Gaara's fight was great.\
\
Search for Tsunade Arc - The mini arc which involves Itachi's return was fascinating. This arc is building up to the next arc. This arc has some nice moments.\
The 101st Episode is a filler episode, but the episode was meant to be over the top, it's the \"Kakashi Mask\" episode. It is so silly. It's even silly that they show a horse taking a dump and the horse appears to be laughing while a 4th wall break ensues. Yeah, It's that over the top.\
Land of Tea arc - okay, but not memorable\
\
Sasuke Retrieval Arc - This is a pretty good arc, but has its flaws. It does give promising expectation for the sequel series that follows after.\
Every single filler arc after the \"Sasuke Retrieval\" Arc - BULLSHIT! And a waste of time. Some are funny, some are stupid, some are tedious, and some are just flat-out boring and unneeded.\
Even if the story is plausible and even though the direction by Hayato Date may be a little mixed at times... the 85 episode streak of fillers is the show's biggest weakness. I have good news for you about these fillers. These fillers are after the main story, unless you are a masochist, skip the fillers and jump right into Shippuden, you aren't missing anything after Episode 135.\
The animation is pretty good, but it is slightly dated. It does look better in later arcs. I find it odd that the animation does look better in certain episodes. But there are some episodes that look fluid but less exact than the rest of the show, should I say that the animation is slightly hit and miss? I'll leave this up for you to debate. The one thing that does get repetitive is the use of flashbacks. I am damn serious. This show overkills on the flashbacks. I know it's used to have the character remember certain memories from those characters’ pasts, but it could have been reduced to a certain amount of scenes.\
The music by Toshio Masuda and... Musashi Project (a band?) is... fitting for the show in some areas, , but I guess there are some noteworthy songs in the show that are fine without the show. I will give the show some props that it does have a a couple good openings to get pumped up for the episode to start. Some closing themes are good too\
I guess the characters are another thing to mention. Some of these characters are deemed as one-dimensional characters *I get punched in the face again for saying* \"OW! Damn It, Who's doing that!?... Hello? I said some, not all of them\" okay, there are some really good characters in this show. The one thing that some people have criticized the characters for is that some of these characters are a bit stereotypical and can be deemed insulting in some way... This show does have too many characters. There are too many supporting characters, too many minor villains, too many minor characters. There are hundreds of characters. Much less if you skip the filler at least. There will be more added when you see Naruto Shippuden.\
The voice acting on both sides does need to be commented on...\
The Japanese cast is pretty good and listenable, The English Dub on the other hand isn't bad either *A bunch of masked Ninja appear and all of them have weapons near me ready to kill* \"Ok, ok, hear me out, hear me out\" The dub is a bit rocky at first and if you remember your first memory of the dub, you got used to it and it got better later on. What I think saved the dub was Steve Blum's performance as Zabuza. (He had a lot of fun as Orochimaru, I can guarantee you that). But the dub has its flaws. Some characters have their voices changed because of certain characters fighting each other that could have ended up played by the same voice (Viz Media obviously didn't read the manga to find out who would fight who) some of these voice changes were made for the better. *The Ninja put away their weapons and they leave*\
Junko Takeuchi and Maile Flanagan are very well known for their roles as Naruto, Even though Naruto may have been annoying at first in the dub, Naruto's English voice is just as fitting as the subbed version, even though they sound a little different. Sakura's Seiyuu and English voice actress are okay, Noriaki Sugimiya and Yuri Lowenthal are terrific as Sasuke. There are other cast members for both Japanese and English that have their spotlight, but there are so many cast members to mention. Look them up if you want to...\
I guess the real question is... Why do a lot of people like this anime so much, is it the action? is it the themes? Is it the characters? well there are a lot of reasons that a lot of people like this anime. There are some people that find this anime extremely overrated. I may kindly say that I really did like this show in the past. I had a lot of fun watching it. It is super popular that the manga has caught up quickly to catch up with the Japanese serialization. The 7th volume of the manga won a Quill Award in the US (Some award for books I guess) The anime and the manga is one of Viz Media's bestselling titles in the US.\
Naruto is available from Viz Media; the manga adaptation by Masashi Kishimoto is also available by Viz Media. Two light novels are probably available by Viz Media, an OVA called \"Protect the Waterfall Village\" is the one of the only two OVAs available by Viz Media while the others were never licensed. The Leaf Village sports festival OVA came with the first movie, The three movies \"Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow\", \"Legend of The Stone Gelel\", and \"Guardians of The Crescent Moon Kingdom\" are also available by Viz Media. There's also several video games released by other companies but there are too many to tell and there really isn't a point to tell them all. Same goes with the trading card game... Also, Naruto Shippuden (the sequel to Naruto) is obviously available from Viz Media\
With that said, Naruto may not be everyone's cup of tea. But it is a very entertaining show that has some really interesting themes. Before I finish my review of Naruto. I will give this show two ratings. One rating for the beginning till the filler streak and one rating for the show as a whole (from Episode 1-220)\
I give Naruto a 7.5 out of 10 without the filler streak. It is GOOD!\
\
For the show as a whole though, I give Naruto a 6.5 out of 10, it is DECENT!\
Feel free to leave a comment and pursue your dreams. \

    Ah.... Memories. Aside from Pokemon and Digmon, I can proudly say that this was my first anime series.\
For this review, I would only be covering on the Naruto series not the Shippuden one. The series portrays a young ninja named Naruto that aims to become the next Hokage(Leader) of the Hidden Leaf Village.\
I'll start off with good parts of this anime, the story or plot line is brilliantly done, with good twists every now and then makes the viewers ever more curious to know what is coming next, this is what truly makes the series addicting. Character wise, really good back story for each of\
          \
        the characters, although most of the supporting characters of the series is shown on Shippuden. Even so, the series tried its best to form a relationship between the reader and the characters which render the viewers more attached to the series and thus creates \"viewers loyalty\"\
As there is light, there will always be shadows, one of the main cons of this series is that with episodes reaching over hundreds, there are way too many fillers and unnecessary mini-stories. I understand that the purpose of fillers is to make time and space for the writers to come up with idea for the main story line, but sometimes the fillers are way too long. The visuals are not as well done compared with other anime. For instance comparing it with the 2006 anime series Fate Stay Night, the visuals are quite lackluster.\
With that being said, the pros of this series clearly outshines its cons. In my opinion, the story line of the anime is much more of significance compared with visuals and such. Oh yea, there are way too many openings and ending songs too cover, but leave it at that, some are good and some mediocre. All in all, this is one of the anime that I would consider a gem and would hold a special place in me as this is also the anime that brought me into the anime universe.",

    Okay, so I was just getting into anime when I came across Naruto. I know that most people start off with animes like Naruto, One Piece, Attack on Titan, and etc and then they move on to different anime and get a general taste in what genre they prefer. What surprised me though is that this anime has always been my absolute favorite, and although I didn't grow up with Naruto like a lot of other people, for me the same feelings come across through watching the show. The world they live in is charming, but can be quite chaotic at times. Each character has\
          \
        their own unique design that complements who they are and their personalities. Each character is different and it is interesting to see what being a ninja means to them. I think the thing I like most about this series is that each character has their own story and preference and how characters grow throughout the series. Like, take Naruto for example, he has always wanted to become Hokage (leader of village) to be acknowledged but he realizes that to be Hokage means to gain the trust of the village. It is amazing to see how much Naruto cares about his friends' well being and how he creates new bonds with the people he meets to be honest it is inspiring to me.  And yes  I do realize that there is a lot of filler but if you don't care about those episodes than just skip it and once you finish all the canon episodes go back and watch the filler. Overall Naruto is a great series for anyone but I recommend it if you are new to anime or if you just love Shonen battle series\

    Story(10) A young jinchuuriki that have a fox goes through hardships to achieve the goal of becoming Hokage. Friends join him on his adventure, and the extravagance ideals of what makes a shinobi differs from each individual. (Personal Opinion) This anime is a extravaganza of fun, and if you like characters that aim to be cool,silly, or other fun personalities this is the one to watch. I'd would personally skip some fillers ,and some are enjoyable this part differentiates with a individual I didn't take away a point since you can skip it.\
Art(10) For it's time it did outstanding the fluidness of the battles is\
          \
        where it shows. \
Sound(10) Never have I'd imagine a masterpiece to my ears during the personal moments of a shinobi, and the fun moments of one. It's really good to listen to.\
Character(10) There's got to be a favorite character for each watcher of this series, and the one you find annoying which isn't a bad thing. The uniqueness of each individual is prevalent by far.\
Enjoyment(10) You have a well rounded story minus the fillers, and great character build up. Also a nice touch to the soundtrack.\

    Naruto is one of the most well known anime of all time. Many people love it, many people hate it. I love it. Yes, it may be overrated, but I give it a 10 cuz its one of my favorite animes. Ever since I started watching it, I got hooked. I am still crazy about it. It may have fillers, has flaws, and the characters can get annoying, its still a lovable series. I wil try not to include spoilers. \
Naruto is about a boy named Naruto Uzamaki who had no friends. He was always alone, and sad. He never understood why everyone hated him.\
          \
        The truth is, the Nine Tailed Fox is inside of him. 12 years ago, this creature attacked the hidden leaf village. The 4th hokage sealed the monster inside Naruto. Thats why everyone hates him. Naruto's main goal is to become hokage and make everyone see how great he is. He starts training as a genin Ninja, and joins Team 7, with the leader being Kakashi Hateo, a Jonin Ninja. Naruto's two teammates are Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haurno. Sasuke is a grumpy, nasty boy from the Uchiha Clan, and is out of revenge. Sakura Haurno is from the Haurno Clan I guess? She has a huge crush on Sasuke and hates Naruto. Naruto and his team go on mission's, train, and go in the Chunnin Exam. Naruto's quest now begans as he encounters death, lost, and betrayl.\
While the series may have fillers, they arent to bad. Episodes 136-220 is all filler, so episode 135 is the last canon episode. Most of the fillers do get in the way, but some are funny and enjoyable. \
This anime does have a good soundtrack. It has one of the greatest soundtracks in all of anime. The music is amazing! The opening songs are very catchy and lovable. \
When it comes to fight scenes, Naruto doesnt fail with that. Most of Naruto is fight scenes. The fight between Naruto and Neji was amazing. It was exiting, and I didnt expect what happened.(Im not going to spoil that). The fight with Naruto and Sasuke was epic, and it was like 6 episodes. It was very intense. This anime really gets you hyped when it comes to pure action. \
This doesnt mean this anime isnt funny. You will get plenty of laughs from all the characters. Naruto may be funny with his foolishness, and his Sexy no Jutsu, but there are fillers that will make you laugh really hard. Like the filler with Naruto wanting to know what Kakashi looks like without the mask, it was so funny how they tried to do it. Its also funny when Sakura gets pissed and beats the shit out of everyone. The funnist moments are when Jiayria is being a pervert. \
I also love the characters. I always Gaara. He is pure badass. He has a amazing character development, design, and personality. I love his Sand Jutsu, which makes him so strong. I also really like Itachi. Besides from Gaara, Itachi is the most badass character you can find in the original series. But almost all the characters are enjoyable and memorable. A few like Ma Sakura, Shino, and Komamahru are just annoying. But the character development is still good, mostly for Naruto.\
One thing I dont like is how half of the series is based of Sasuke. Naruto is the star. He should be the really important one. But is Saskue that everyone worries about. Like everyone is after him, he dissapers, he leaves the leaf village. Most of the anime is all Sasuke. But I still love the anime either way.\
This anime isnt to sad. But there are some moments that are so sad. Like when Ikura went to save Naruto from danger. I almost cried when I saw it for the first time. When the 3rd Hokage died it was also very upsetting. I cried every time. This anime also has sad music that gets me upset. This anime can get you in the feels.\
I really think this anime is really good. I always enjoyed it. I have rewatched this anime a few times, and it still never gets old. I do understand why people might not like it, and thats okay. Yes, its overrated, but I still give it a 10 cuz I love it. Plz dont write that im stupid on my comments just cuz I gave it a 10 and called it overrated. It is. But im one of those lovers. If your new to anime, this is a good choice. If your a older anime fan, then I cant recommend it. Its one of my favorite animes, and I will always love it.\

“Those that break the rules and regulations are scum. But those who abandon their comrades are worse than scum. If I'm going to be called scum either way, I'd rather break the rules! And if that's not being a proper shinobi, then I'll destroy that idea!”\
Most people who have watched anime have seen Naruto at one point, the same goes for One Piece. For me, the face that i've been watching the show for so long kept me pulled in to keep watching when i started the series beginning to end for the first time. For other people who didn't grow up with the\
          \
        show this same \"pull\" may not apply, especially for the first couple of episodes the show starts off rather slow just as most other anime or shows. Nevertheless i'd still recommend Naruto to anyone especially as a starter anime.\
Story (7/10)\
The story is quite unique in a way – it was set in an entirely different world which, at the same time, resembles real life situations such as wars, laws, conflicts, vengeance, hatred, loyalty, patriotism, and friendship. Although some may say it may resemble other anime, but the setting and the situation of this one is quite different, being in a world of ninjas and all. As mentioned earlier, they ingeniously designed each episode to make your mind wonder what will happen next whereas in psychology, they will feed you what you desire and before you become fully satisfied, they will take it away from you so that you will want to see what will happen in the next episode. Yet, there are too many fillers and for a while all they do is go on mission after mission. There doesn’t seem to be progress at times.\
Art (8/10)\
The art is about average, but depends on when you are watching it. If you were watching in 2014/2015 you would probably rate the art lower as to someone who watched it in 2004. The original run started in September 21, 1999, so to take it in consideration the art is fairly well down for it’s time compared to many other shows out there. \
\
Sound (8/10)\
The soundtrack is really good. Soundtrack is good and very diverse, and there are certainly a few very awesome tracks, but I like the original better than Shippuuden because it suffers from poor timing and poor track placement, and the OST overall lacks the same sense of character that united all of the tracks. Great soundtracks would be Loneliness, The Rising Fighting Spirit and Sadness and Sorrow. Now overall, if you watch dubbed, in my opinion it’s horrible, but in Japanese it’s not bad. \
Character (9/10)\
The character development is great. It takes a lot of time to get to know each character but in about 220 eps you pretty much get to know a little bit about everyone. They take 2-3 eps just to introduce a person or they add that person to the mission, so we get to know more about them. For example,  Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura are the characters you learn the most about in the original series, but say they add Neji to the team mission. During that mission which is usually about 2-3 eps you learn a lot about him. Another example would be during the exam, Rock Lee fights Gaara and it take 5+ eps but you learn so much about them. Now, I personally don’t like all the flashbacks but I do think they are valuable to learn about a character. \
Enjoy (7/10)\
The enjoyment was average for me. Usually, I find myself skipping parts after a while because sometimes it would be boring. There would be a fight but that fight takes like 5 eps because of flashbacks, which is valuable sometimes,  but not when it’s a character who will only be there for those episodes. Take Sasuke’s arc for example when everyone is chasing him, the fights were awesome back there was a flashback every fight they got into. It personally takes the enjoyment away for me at times. . \
Overall (8/10)\
Overall, Naruto has its ups and downs. The storyline is deep, with a plot that follows the manga. Naruto also has several filler arcs which lead away from the main plot. The music is great, and matches up with scenes well. The characters of Naruto, are well thought out.. they all have details about them and are interesting to watch. Animation is excellent. Fights are very detailed, you know how far away the characters are, and there are great camera angles.\

    I realized and accepted that not everyone is going to like something, or dislike it. No matter what the anime (or book, or game, etc.) it boils down to personal preference. So, how do you know if you'd like something you've never seen but heard so much about? \
When I first started Naruto, I saw the potential in it. From the first episode, they presented a distinct setting with distinct characters. Sure, archetypes were being followed (the boy dreaming of becoming hokage, the teacher, the rival). The first episode showed emotion and depth to its main character and what he will struggle with, along with\
          \
        the dynamics of his interaction with other characters.\
OST and EST in this anime are perfect.\
Having seen all episodes, I can say at least for myself that at its best Naruto is a deeper anime than some give credit to, and can be quite addicting. A strong focus is on its characters as they develop throughout the series and there are moments of real emotion, tragedy, intensity and even just amusement. It's not perfect,and not everybody will like it,but to me it's one of my favorite anime ever..\

    It gets an 8 for me simply because I manage to get a friend who doesn't like anime to watch the entirety of this with me. But there's other reasons I like it.\
* Unique diverse fighting styles for each character.\
* Many interesting characters with interesting backstories.\
* Antagonists have some depth to them that can be relatable.\
* Character development as the series goes by.\
* Main character is also a very cute kid, that's around 7 points default.\
Naruto unfortunately suffers from a unreal amount of filler at some point which is a big turn off for the series. But you can easily skip them now and go\
          \
        to the main story perfectly fine without missing anything.\

    I watched Naruto during the time I was fourteen and dropped it when I was sixteen shortly after watching Shippuuden. Roughly. I can't remember for sure, seeing as this was nearly a decade ago. It was one of the first animes I ever watched and it was easily one of the longest; I had picked it up as a show to watch as it was the most popular one out there during the time. \
Naruto was the anime that made me realise that just because something is popular, it doesn't necessarily mean that you'll like it. \
\
Story: 6/10: \
I really enjoyed the premise of the\
          \
        show. A boy who is an outcast because he has a demon trapped inside of him, and because he gets no attention he's a bit of a prankster? Cool. It makes sense. He also wants to be the Hokage and get some recognition and respect when he makes it. \
This is fine - I don't mind this. It's essentially the same as Ash trying to become a Pokemon Master. I also really enjoyed the beginning when Naruto and his two companions (more on these three later) train together with their teacher and one of the other instructors would take Naruto out for ramen every now and then. It was a nice element of realisim and added to the character building which was pretty nice.\
\
When it all really falls apart, is after the Chunin Exam arc. Aka Naurto's class taking part in an official \"to become a Ninja you must pass this test\" exam. The chunin exam is great as you get to see a variety of characters with their own different skills and mindsets and then after that the story kind of... dwindles into boring. \
The arcs are split up into \"someone has a problem-the team agree to fix that problem-fight scene-fight scene-fight scene-backstory-fight scene-fight scene-resolution.\" Then near the end Sasuke goes and drowns in the \"emo-angsting-teenager\" pool and runs away with one of the snake villains. YUP. Why they called the next series Naruto:Shippuuden and not just plain Sasuke baffles me. \
A romance element is also added, which really shouldn't have been there. It's kind of like Misty in Pokemon, after a while it becomes painful to watch. They really should've done what they did in One Piece and had No Romance Whatsoever. Friendship between these threewould've been much better. I actively enjoyed Sakura's friendship with Naruto over shipping her with either of her companions. \
Art: 7/10 \
The art was pretty good from what I remember, at least it is for something that is more than ten years old. There were no weird gammy faces and the animiation seemed pretty smooth to me. This is from my recollections as a teenager though, so take this with a pinch of salt. \
\
Sound: 8/10 \
Biased on this as I really enjoyed the opening and closing tunes, to the point that I downloaded them and put them on my MP3 player. I doubt I would do the same thing now if I heard these songs for the first time, but at the time they were good. The soundtrack worked pretty well for me. \
\
Character: 3/10 \
What really lets Naruto down as a series is its characters. I've touched on the Chunin Arc already, but what was really great about that arc was the fact that we saw other members of Naruto's class and saw their skills which was really fun. Then when they leave, you remember how mediocre our main cast is and you just want them to come back again. \
Naruto - Naruto is the typical main character who TRIES HIS BEST and SACRIFICES HIS OWN HEALTH to help his friends and he will do anything to become a hokage except, well, he's really stupid. Like, stupid anime stupid. He is only supposed to be a pre-teen so we can let him get away with it, but argh it is not fun to watch. \
\
Sasuke: Sasuke is great at everything and everyone loves him *swoon*, oh look he glared in my direction I think im in love! Sasuke is one of the reasons I stopped watching this show. Just imagine an emo-teen who thinks the world is out to get him and because of this, takes it out on his friends and people who care about him. This is Sasuke's character. \
\
Sakura: the girl. She is the girl. This is it to Sakura, which broke my naiive heart a little at fourteen as I was really expecting great things. At the beginning she has the best control over her chakra (essentially what ninjas use to do ninjitsu) and she has high marks in her tests and then.... we find out actually, lol she's just a girl. Let's make her wildly in love with Sasuke and make Naruto in love with her. Even when Sasuke and Naruto get better later on, she'll have a cry about it and then learn the Girl Ninjitsu of Healing. Even though she has super strength, sure she can just heal instead, ok \
\
The rest of the characters aren't worth mentioning. One of the Hokages is a pervert, one of the hokages has big breasts. Hilarious. Shizune is pretty great, from what I remember though. \
\
Enjoyment: 4/10 \
Sakura being Sakura and Sasuke being Sasuke kills most of the enjoyment from me during this. The beginning of Naruto is great when they work together and beat up small-time criminals but when actual plot happens (and then more importantly the Almighty Terrible Filler Arc happens) it just tumbles further and further downhill and when I watched it, I hoped it would get better. It didn't.\
Though, on the plus side, it is at least better than its sequel! \

Some Spoilers Ensue:\
I've finally finished! Wow, what a ride this was! I absolutely loved this show and I'm so excited to start Shippuden! I love Shounen anime and this one was up there with the best of them. It consisted of about 130 or so canon episodes, and 90 or so filler episodes. The canon episodes were amazing and the filler were...well, filler. Going into the show, I found myself not loving the first 20 or so episodes, but once we got to the arc dealing with Haku and Zabuza, I became hooked. What really set the show off thought was when we started the\
          \
        exams. Oh my fuck I was watching like 12 eps a day and I couldn't get enough. The fighting was epic. I loved finding out about all the different jutsu specific to each character. There seems to be a divide in the fandom on Sasuke, but I loved him. I felt his pain and I loved his development.\
Story:\
The overlying arc of this show lies with the development of its characters. 3 ninja with different goals are growing up and learning their crafts. They go on missions along the way and each have a bit of story surrounding them. Naruto holds the spirit of a fox demon in him that was sealed by the hokage. His overall goal throughout the show is to become hokage which I hope plays out in Shippuden. Sasuke is on the path to revenge after his parents were brutally murdered when he was little. His story is one of the most thrilling. Sakura...well she wasn't my favorite. Most of the time she was either pining over Sasuke or being a burden during fights. She only slightly got better after she decided to become a medical ninja. Of course, what starts out as only 3 character arcs quickly becomes many more as we enter the Chunin exams and get a slew of new and interesting characters. From there, the show really spreads its wings and shows you why it is one of the most popular anime of all time.\
Animation:\
It was very hit and miss for me. Some of it was good (I.e. the Naruto vs. Sasuke fight), and some of it was below average. I'm hoping that it gets better with Shippuden because this was probably my worst critique for this show.\
Sound:\
The show shines here. Almost every OP and ED theme are catchy and good. I especially loved CHABA's \"Parade\" and FLOW's \"Remember\" among others. The OST music is really good too if a bit overplayed. The voice acting was also above par for the most part. During the filler, I could pick out some lacking VAs, but during the canon show, it was solid.\
Characters:\
Another reason why I adore this show is the characters. I have so many favorites I can't even decide who I like the most. Everyone was fledged out and everyone got their moment to shine. Some huge standouts were Gaara, Shikamaru, Kiba, Neji, Hinata, Kakashi, Jiraiya, everyone. They were so fulfilling to watch and they had their own ways of doing things and their own obstacles to overcome which made the show all the more interesting to watch.\
A Note About The Filler:\
The good thing about Naruto is that there was hardly ANY filler in the first half of the show. They shoved it all in at the end which is both good and bad. For one, it lets the whole show flow the way its supposed to and makes for a super interesting watch. For two (if you're a completionist like me), it makes for a tedious last half. There are only 2 filler eps and one arc during the canon episodes. I can't say I hated the filler, but I could have done without it for sure. Some standout filler were:\
1. EP101 - Gotta See! Gotta Know! which is the infamous Kakashi face reveal. It is funny and definitely worth a watch.\
2. EPS136-141 - Land Of Rice Fields Arc where we still get some Orochimaru and some cool stuff with Jiraiya.\
3. EP168 - The Ramen episode which is so bad its good.\
4. EP177 - The one with Jiraiya's book and the mailmen...it's great.\
5. EPS197-201 - Trap Master Arc because I thought it was cool to see a lot of my favorites working together after so much time in just groups of 3.\
6. EPS213-215 - The Menma Arc because feels.\
Overall:\
The show itself is super addicting. I loved the exams, the battle between Orochimaru and the Third Hokage, and of course, the entirety of EPS 101-135. The battle between Naruto and Sasuke is up there with some of the best anime battles I've seen yet. It was as epic as it could get and I just loved every second. Haters can hate, but there's a reason why this show is so popular.\

    Naruto.. I wasn't sure how to go about writing this since it's such a long series, so I figured the best way would to be write a little bit as I go and piece them together.\
You immediately start off with Naruto Uzumaki, he's a cheeky kid, always causing trouble and when he's not, he's eating. \
Though you find out pretty quickly that there's a reason for it; he just wants to be cared for. Everybody has always looked down on him and judged him for reasons he didn't know. He always just figured it was because he was different, not because of something inside of\
          \
         him. \
Finding out he has the love he's wanted from Iruka sensei, his point of view starts to change but so does everything else. \
From there he's placed in Team 7 with Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto has a massive crush on Sakura, Sakura loves Sasuke, and he doesn't really want anything to do with either of them.\
Naruto comes to have a lot of respect for Kakashi sensei, like he does with Iruka and then Jiraiya. All 3 of them play a big part in his personal development. They all show him he's loved, which is something important to him. \
From the beginning it's a little slow, but it gets better. New characters start coming in, whether they're here with their own stories or to embellish on unfolding the plot, it depends on the person. Some stay and become prominent, others are just in and out very quickly. \
In all honesty, for a lot of it it wasn't really keeping my attention well, there'd be a couple of laughs or plot points that would catch my attention, but it would drop off quickly; Until Jiraiya. \
He's what saved the series for me, his character type and personality, but with him came the story getting deeper and lots of questions about how multiple different things will turn out. \
As with really long series, it takes a pretty long time for the story to get deep, this is no different. But once it does, it's decent. \
A lot of it is kids growing up, that might be why I wasn't enjoying it a whole lot until more adult humour came into it. But if kiddy characters and voices annoy you, this probably will too. They're kids, they're learning, so things that are obvious to the viewers aren't quickly discovered by them, there's childish arguments and irresponsibility. But they're kids. That's the point. This is showing them growing up, becoming better and learning about themselves and others. \
That's one thing about the fillers, I always watch them, but people who skipped them for this missed all the growth these kids go through. Becoming stronger mentally and physically, seeing it happen is one of the best parts, and makes the fillers worth it.\
There are some definite feels parts, I got a little teary a couple of times. The Menma Memory Search mission arc was a big one. So be prepared for hidden emotional parts, because they pop up out of nowhere.\
By the end I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, no it's not something I'm extremely impressed with but I'm happy I finished it. I enjoyed it, I'm glad I gave it a chance to prove that it's better than I assumed it would be, and I can see why so many people enjoy it.\

    Nostalgia is probably pumping up my ratings here haha. Naruto (excluding fillers, please if you're gonna watch skip them because this is a long ass series and they don't really add anything to the story in my opinion) is a really good story when it starts out. As a shounen genre type thing I really liked the exploration of darker themes with ultimately good messages. The character development is interesting, the story is engaging, and it it gives you characters to root for. It can be funny, it can be sad. It's enjoyable and a really common gate way anime. That being said it was\
          \
        originally made for younger audiences and is by no means a true masterpiece of any kind. If you look too much into it you're gonna find a ton of plot holes (and this increases doubly in Shippuden and x100 for anything post that) so enjoy it for what it is. It isn't romance based but the fandom in general is pretty focused on that, so keep that in mind. If you get into a Naruto kick the music is gonna stay with you, it's pretty great! \

    In this review, I ignore ALL filler episodes, and I strongly recommend that anyone watching this do the same. If I didn't, this anime would get a 6 at best, which does not do justice to the episodes that are faithful to the source material. \
Naruto has the most intelligent fighting in all of anime, a varied and powerful soundtrack that never fails to compliment the scenes, intriguing villains and likable protagonists, an addictive nature, a semi-realistic art style that noticeably evolves and improves over time, and a satisfying plot, despite being a bit slow.\
The problem is that all of this is basically there to\
          \
        justify the fight scenes. If those scenes were not there, or if they were not as good as they are, Naruto becomes meh. I would estimate that more than half of Naruto is spent in fighting scenes. This huge dependence on something that, in other anime, merely adds spice to an already awesome package prevents me from ranking this up with the best of the best. \
On the other hand, those fight scenes are the best I've seen. In particular, characters will set up multi-step plans more or less right before your eyes, without you realizing it. They will then blow you away with the checkmate, and you get an explanation of exactly what they were doing before and why. This makes for intense, thrilling action that culminates in 'OH, SNAP!' climaxes. Intelligence, and not last minute powerups or brute force, wins the day in Naruto. Furthermore, abilities in Naruto always have disadvantages, limitations, or risks, which are made clear to the viewer. There are no random asspulls. Even with those restrictions, abilities are basically always used in unexpected and creative ways. The same trick never works twice. Naruto also knows when a simple, emotionally charged beat down is called for, and delivers them. In summary, Naruto is the Death Note of fighting. If that's what you want, definitely watch this anime.\

    So.... Naruto. I don't really know why I'm writing this review as my first review, there are plenty already,  and I don't particularly care about the series... I guess it's one of those whims. Let's move on to the review then, I'll try to keep it short. And btw, I'm writing the review for the whole Naruto series, including Shippuden and the rest.\
Naruto is without any shred of doubt, the most popular anime outside Japan today. Completely surpassed any high Pokemon, Dragon Ball or Yu-gi-oh ever achieved, the whole world all of a sudden just can't have enough ninjas. These are all for a\
          \
        good reason, the anime completely blew most American cartoon in term of maturity, art quality, story and bgm, yet somehow keep it simple enough for kids to love. It didn't deliberately dumb itself down as if mocking 12+ years old kids brain size, yet not twisted enough to ruin an 8 years old fantasies and innocence. Suddenly kids are treated to a cartoon that not only gets you laughing but also complex and heart rending.\
Now the question is, why did I only gave the anime a 6 if it is that good? Because ultimately, this anime is a kids stories disguised as something mature. And as a mid-20s seasoned anime enthusiast (read: otaku), it's just hard for me to find this engaging. Here's the complete breakdown:\
Plot (5) - Debatable: Why debatable? Because maybe for younger audience, this was a masterpiece, who knows? But for me, the protracted episodes length, the out of place fillers that keeps contradicting the canon, the almost stale twists in every corner of the plot only to be replaced by yet another twists. 5 is generous.\
Art (5): Completely mediocre, barely average (thus the 5). Understandable since the anime is made to be long running, but it doesn't erase the fact that the art quality is lacking compared to other shorter series from the same time.\
Sound (7.5): As with other popular JUMP's anime such as One Piece, Bleach, Beelzebub, etc. the op and ed were typically beautiful, picked from various famous contemporary j-pop/rock. The in-anime BGM was nothing special.\
Chara (6) - Debatable: Nothing special, typical of shonen series. Sasuke's breakthrough as one of the most likeable antagonist is pretty notable, as his duality existence with Naruto had been the driving force of this series since the time skip.\
Enjoyment/Overall (6) - Debatable: It was pretty enjoyable at first, especially back at the time when I still don't mind watching anime with more than 50 episodes. But after 100+ episodes, with each episodes so protracted, with not much happening, I decided to drop the anime and just read the manga. This is not isolated to only Naruto, but I always find that anime adaptation of the manga tend to move really slowly and less enjoyable than the manga, especially if it's JUMP's.\
\
So that's my review and I just want to leave a few words, for all of you so called 'Narutards', Naruto is not the best anime ever, it was not even close and never will be. It was good, and that's it. For trolls and haters, No, the anime is not as bad as you make it to be.\

    Naruto is definently not as good as people say it is, the story has been done to death, but most other aspects of the series are good.\
Story: like previously stated nothing new here, ninja boy reaches to achieve his dreams, has many wacky and serious adventures along the way.\
Art: The animation for Naruto is good, i would put it above what Shippudden is like right now, the character design isn't really all that different, i mean 5-6 sub-main characters have permanent spiked hair.\
Sound: The intro themes are some of my favorite, i love Asian Kung Fu generation, and i never really listen to the endings\
          \
        but that doesn't matter, the music they use tends to fit the scenarios, ie.no hard stuff during funny moments, but most anime has decent sound tracks.\
Character: Like most shonen anime they catch with the characters, and they are all well made. You can find all the different characteristics in this anime, emo, goth(gaara), pervert, blah blah blah i gerantee you will find at least 1 memorable character in Naruto.\
Because of the easily predictable story line, my enjoyment of the series is lost, half way through all the episodes you can pretty much predict who its gonna end, but its still worth your watch.\
Overall im giving it an 8 good series if a tad predicatble, but hell its a shit load better than shippudden \

    Ok, first things first. Im a girl. I'm more of a shoujo person. And at first I thought Naruto was stupid. I like animes like Ouran High school or Fruits Basket, But even if you are like me and you don't like action, let me tell you this: YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!!! After watching the first ten episodes I fell in love with it. And in a month, I'm already done with the first season of Naruto (220 episodes) and now waiting for the 336th episode of Naruto Shippuuden to be released. \
The art isn't bad, and I just love the characters. Naruto is\
          \
        really really funny, you have to make sure you go take a piss before you watch an episode. I may make it sound very calm, but the author did a really really good job at blending blood, fighting, comedy, and a tiny bit of love in it. There are a lot of morals, like \"never give up\". It's not too confusing to understand all the concepts of the shinobi. I really really enjoyed the story and the characters. A MUST WATCH FOR GUYS AND GIRLS EVEN!!! Well, maybe I'm overrating it a bit, but this is one of the best, funniest, most actiony animes out there! \

    As you can see I had to give this anime 7's all across mainly because the last 70 episodes were dreadful and drag this anime down a whole lot. With that said the first 130 episodes or so were fantastic I Must say. Naruto was one of the first animes I cracked open, and at first it appeared fresh and bold taking Anime to a new level, and it did for the most part. Although Naruto has MANY good points, it also fails miserable at many things.\
Story\
The Story has been kind of done before, a loser kid wanting to become a winner. But this loser\
          \
        kid has been given some kind of special power which the leader of his ninja clan implanted in him at birth known as the Nine Tail fox. Naruto now looks to become the leader of his Ninja clan, so Naruto Uzamaki with this orange jump suit and heart wrenching battle cry 'IM GONA BE HOKAGE' sets out to become the best ninja in his clan.\
Characters\
This is where I really enjoyed the show and didn&rsquo;t enjoy the show. Of course Naruto the main protagonist is interesting for a while but the anime focuses far to much on him and puts everyone else in a very long waiting line. No other characters besides Naruto and to some extent Sauske  (Narutos rival and best friend)get a fair level of development. Now the villains are certainly exciting in Naruto  and for most fans like myself, the villains actually carry the show more then Naruto. Its always interesting when the villains are conspiring mysterious schemes.\
Overall\
Although Naruto is entertaining at first, it quickly begins to fade as a show that&rsquo;s lived for too long. After a while the story line becomes weak and very boring as fans ache to see more of the villain instead are fed filler episodes. The characters may get annoying but to Naruto&rsquo;s credit, the fighting style and drama is very real and new. If your looking for that anime that has a good level of action, drama, and comedy you should try Naruto.",

    Naruto and Naruto Shippuden are my favorite anime, but i'm going to stick to my guns and give this show an honest review. \
Most people who have watched anime have seen Naruto at one point, the same goes for One Piece. For me, the face that i've been watching the show for so long kept me pulled in to keep watching when i started the series beginning to end for the first time. For other people who didn't grow up with the show this same \"pull\" may not apply, especially for the first couple of episodes the show starts off rather slow just as most\
          \
        other anime or shows. Nevertheless i'd still recommend Naruto to anyone especially as a starter anime.\
Now on to the review :p\
The animation is good, nothing special but it's not bad at all especially for its time. the voice acting still holds up as spot on emotional at some times performances. This applies for both the Japanese and English dub though i do recommend the English. The story is great, some if not most episodes end in cliffhangers making me want to watch more. The show is well balanced with action and dialogue/story moments. Aside from some crappy fillers, the episodes do a good job building up the story and telling it well. Some fillers are good and fun to watch, while others seem like a complete waste of time. up until the 100's there are hardly any fillers at all and the story stays consistent with build up and excellent storytelling. The story does a good job at showing progression throughout the series, the characters mature and change and the story evolves. When one arc ends, a new one starts keeping its roots to the central story but being different at the same time to not just feel like you're seeing the same thing over again. The characterization is one of the show's best features, as the story goes on, you genuinely start to care about these characters and understand them well. Certain characters are kept mysterious when they need to be, and it's interesting to see their intentions revealed over time. With other character's it's nice to watch some change and mature as the show progresses on. The story isn't full of crazy plot twists or intense action though. However this is only part 1 of the series so it's done like that for obvious reasons i guess. The action at some points is spot on and can be surprising as well, but like i said the show can sometimes lack a real intensity.\
Basically that's everything, i didn't truly have any gripes with the show, but it's obviously nothing outstanding and perfect. Still Naruto is a great show nonetheless and i'd highly recommend it.\
I apologize if this review was bad, but i hope i can help at least a few people (:\

    Naruto is a gateway anime of the worst kind. It's a bad series, a clusterfuck of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive shipping faggotry and DARKNESS. The normal anon can see this as the shit it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the series itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.\
    However, these very aspects that try to smear over the shit of its core make it a breeding ground for\
          \
        aspie, unsociable underageb& faggots who engage in every kind of faggotry both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the jutsus, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole ninja faggotry and everything about the Naruto world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on revenge, and overall preachiness of the series make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of shit that makes little kiddies and underageb& retards eat this shit right the fuck up.\
    Naruto is basically THE series to attract the most hated anime fanbase known to /a/, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every anon to troll the fuck out of this show and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no Naruto threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here.\

    I see alot of reviews on here attacking the \"fanboys\" and how this show is not any good. Those people who are so aggressively against naruto are the exact opposite of the fanboy and there arguments are bias in the other direction. Due to that fact, they also cant be trusted. \
An honest review of Naruto should be mostly positive because the show is pretty good at alot of things. To start, the world building in Naruto is fantastic, the shin-obi world that has been created is interesting and unique. They also capitalize on that world building by making what seems like realistic decisions and\
          \
        not going overboard. So the story focuses on a determined little boy named Naruto, who lacks talent but makes up for it with his spirit and guts. Naruto might not be the most interesting character but he is love able and I found my self rooting for him to succeed. The rest of the characters are pretty like able and the story does a good job of fleshing each character out and making them feel real. The plot is interesting in its twists and turns, while the motives of Naruto and his friends seem genuine. Where the show falters are in battles, or at least the battle scenes, which are predictable and take an overly long time. Characters often are found talking to eachother and experiencing flashbacks during battle which really can get tiresome. The battles can be interesting at times but too much of the times your thinking \"JUST FIGHT ALREADY!!!\" Also seeing the same flashbacks over and over can be annoying and it just seems like a way to extend episodes. \
Overall though Naruto succeeds at pulling you in and making you care about the characters. Even though the battles can seem tedious, you stick with it because you're anxious of the fate of a character you've grown to love. Also don't complain about fillers, just skip them and you'll be fine.       \

    Dattebayo! That's the trademark of one of the most famous anime character, Naruto. Named by some kind of ingredient in ramen. The story is just wow. It's just plain epic! You can see the journey of a boy who is being resent growing up to be a great ninja and become Hokage. All of the conflict, the struggles, tough challenges and emotional elements blended very well. But, it was kind of disappointing when your hero was unable to safe his friend. Anyway, the art of this series was very good. The character was written very well.

        times to shine and everyone was developed greatly. Moreover, I can relate with most of this characters, which means it was carefully planned. I was enlightened by this story greatly. It gives you so many live lessons. It's not just some cartoon for kids, it's more than that. I called it cartoon before. Overall, I know this story does not perfect. It has it's flaws and not all people can get into it. It contains quite number of fillers too. I recommend you who read this to watch this series if you haven't.\

    Naruto had been really hyped up before I had even clicked episode one, so I was expecting a lot. When I started it I loved it but when I got to the end, it got really boring. Was it worth watching? Defiantly. Did I enjoy myself? Yes and will I watch Shippuuden? Yes. But that isn't what makes me kind of dislike this anime. \
The story for this anime is great. Ninja's are awesome and all the missions they went on were very interesting until the end of the show. Now, the main villain is Orochimaru, one of the best and scariest anime villains I\
          \
        have seen thus far and whenever he was on screen was the highlight of the show. He was just there and I was invested. He was a huge part for most of it and I found those episodes the best. And then the whole thing with Sasuke went down and we basically never saw him again, and it got boring. All they did for the rest of the anime was go on missions that were not necessary at all. It made me literally fall asleep because I didn't care what was going on. \
The characters were the best part of the series. They all have their unique styles and personalities that make you remember them. The top three that were most memorable, excluding Naruto, were Sasuke, Orochimaru and Gaara. All three of them were so fun to watch on the screen and I never got bored when they showed up. Hinata and Neji are also very interesting alongside Lee. Now of course Naruto, the star of the show. Most of the time he was on screen I was laughing and I was usually cheering for him. Though when Orochimaru came on screen I never really knew who to cheer for. No one hate me but I love Orochimaru, he is one of my favourite characters, behind Neji and in front of Hinata. Like those three, god bless them.\
The animation was okay. This was made a while ago so it wasn't the greatest but I've seen worse. Moving to the music, I really liked it. There were some instrumental pieces that were kind of memorable but not as much as I know the music in Shippuuden will be. The openings however always got my attention. They were catchy and fun to sing along to. Especially Go by Flow and Kanashimi o Yasashisa ni by Little by Little. \
Overall I enjoyed watching Naruto, it was just the ending that spoiled it for me. I'll watch the sequel and hopefully love this series even more. Hopefully it'll make up for the last few episodes for this anime.\
But I give Naruto a 7/10 since I did enjoy myself. Naruto has 220 episode, half of them not even necessary, and aired in 2002-2007. It is from the studio Pierrot and is adapted from the manga of the same name by Masashi Kishimoto.\

    While not to everyone's tastes, I personally thought this anime was amazing. Granted, it's one of those types of anime that you might think of as more of a cartoon than an anime. Very well designed characters that really evolve and change in dramatic, noticeable ways. The plot left me twisting in my seat and biting my nails in anticipation the entire time. You never know what will happen, only that it'll be something amazing and very exciting. Naruto changes everyone he meets and changes everyone's thoughts about practically everything. There isn't much romance, but there are a lot of dynamic characters. Everyone is different.\
          \
        It isn't exactly supernatural, but it is more than natural. Everyone has their own kinds of different powers. \
Overall, an amazing anime. I simply loved it and have rewatched it no less than two or three times. Plan on watching it again in the future. Probably one of the longest good anime series ever. Can't wait to finish the continuing series, Naruto Shippuden.\

    Oh, Naruto. I want to give this series a higher rating since it is the first anime series I have ever watched and is actually the one that helped me decide I should continue watching more. However, with the sheer amount of high quality content out there, Naruto comes off overrated, even with its few redeemable qualities.\
Story – 5\
Without discussion of how events unfold in Shippuden, Naruto shows the early stages before the time skip of when 3 ninja have to individually develop their skills and learn the values of teamwork. I must say the story starts off excellent – there’s discussion of the ninja\
          \
        rules, hopeless battles that are turned around by the protagonists through tact, and introductions of characters that build them up to be extremely threatening. The coolest part of the Naruto story is how ninjas are constantly tested by their ability to see through deception. That being said, the Naruto series is almost half filler (I’m not exaggerating) and beats to death the value of friendship, but in a more “telling” way than “showing” way. At the climax of the story, viewers are supposed to feel the tension of a friendship falling apart between Naruto and Sasuke. However, while the two did have fun times, they rarely shared personal moments or really exhibited their friendship towards each other. They only enjoyed each other in a misery-loves-company way because of how they both grew up alone. For me, the strong bond I was supposed to see simply wasn’t there. \
Art – 3\
The art improves in Shippuden, but the quality of the animation and the jagged uncomfortable drawings of the characters is really off-putting. This is a combination of Kishimoto’s originally slipshod art skills (it gets better) at the beginning of the series and just poor animation. None of the characters look good proportionally, especially the women. The scenery and Konoha itself are really nothing special either, and most of the background is painfully simple in design. Background characters look like almost no effort was put into drawing them. Still, I suppose I have seen worse.\
Sound – 6\
The music is fitting to the anime, but nothing besides the battle soundtracks are really anything special. Compare the soundtrack of Naruto to masterpiece shows like Attack on Titan, Cowboy Bepop, or Puella Magi. The opening themes are nothing special but do have some very enjoyable tunes with JRock standouts like ROCKS, Yura Yura, Haruka Kanata, and Fighting Dreamers. While fitting, the soundtrack rarely evokes the intense emotion required of the scene. This also improves in Shippuden.\
Character – 3\
Boy, oh boy, character development is such a disaster on this show I don’t even know where to begin. The show throws a large ensemble cast at you during the Chunin exams, almost ALL of who add nothing to the story and become complete background throughout the series. The series is also the best at building up characters to seem like they are either strong or have significant plot impact only to forget about them entirely. Examples are Sakura, one of the main characters, who doesn’t exhibit a single unique skill throughout the series (and while she gets better in Shippuden skill-wise, she is given almost no screentime) and is in the story because it needs a damsel in distress. The rest of the kunoichi in the series are no better – We don’t even know Tenten’s personality, Hinata’s around for her crush on Naruto and is just a weaker version of Neji, and Ino is the same character as Sakura except with one skill that is extremely difficult to use when fighting on her own. The fifth hokage, Tsunade, is brought in as the strongest ninja in the village, but her skills are rarely showcased either – except that one time she beats up a guy who already had NO ARMS. The same goes for her teammate Jiraiya, another legendary ninja who barely gets a chance to show his stuff, his one time in battle being so drugged by Tsunade he was essentially useless.\
Little else is shown about the other characters’ pasts, male or female. We know that Naruto and Sasuke had it rough as orphans and the Hyugas have a complicated family structure, but we are to assume that most of the other characters live normal lives otherwise. There’s no complexity in their pasts, and very little happens to them throughout the show to shape them into better people, unless it’s a villain who miraculously got turned around by Naruto’s words about how friendship is important (if only it was that easy in real life, eh?). The one true gem of Naruto’s cast is Shikamaru, whose sheer intelligence and developed leadership after the chunin exam makes him impressive and exciting to watch. Overall, however, what One Piece accomplishes for over a hundred characters, including a boat, Naruto fails to for a dozen. \
Overall – 6\
While Naruto is heavily flawed in most ways, looking at it as a whole is quite different. In the same way books like Twilight are page turners, Naruto keeps you on your toes and each arc is genuinely interesting even if the quality of its storytelling is bland. There is plenty of action, maybe so much action that it detracts from all other aspects of the story. Nevertheless, it’s a show about ninjas geared towards teenage boys, and in that respect, it does well. The series presents itself as an amazing gateway anime, and it certainly is still worth watching.",

    Naruto is one of those animes that almost everyone knows about. It's so well known, that only in my country, it streamed in 5 different channels the entire first season. \
If you ask me to describe naruto with one word, it would be : COOL. \
Yeah this anime is cool. It's not so epic/dramatic/funny as other animes are, but for sure it is cool. What do i mean? Well i just loved the plot.. and for young teenagers, or even for more advanced ages, this anime can make you on the edge of your sit. \
Plot: 10/10. This is it. This plot is something amazing.\
          \
        I can´t think about Naruto without thinking about a web. Yes a web. \
There is just so many things to explore, that when you start thinking about it, you get amazed. I watched this anime 4 years ago, and i still find it unbelievable. \
The originality is astonishing. I mean .. this is not just ninjas .. there is bunch of things that makes this anime so big in terms of content. What really impressed me, is the variety of powers. \
Here, on Naruto, you have a thing called \"Chakra\". You born with it. It's like your source of energy to use special skills. Then, depending on the person, the chakra can evolve up to 5 different types of chakra. For each type, there is tons and tons of abilities. Plus, there are special powers, that only some have, are transmited via DNA so only members of that clan can unlock those powers and you also have tons of different clans, so you have really a lot of things to look at. \
While in some animes you get bored because the plot ends up to be the same thing.. here such thing does not happen. There is just to many different types of skills that you will never get tired. There is always something to new to be shown. \
Plus, it's not just about skills and how many there are. It's also about the entire background story. The anime starts by telling that once existed a demon nine-tailed fox that attacked konoha(our main village), and moves 12 years later, and the journey begins.  \
The plot at first. is simple and nothing great.. but with time, new things will be added, new characters will be introduced. Besides One Piece, this anime has the biggest cast i've ever seen. But unlike One Piece, when everything is forgotten at some point, here they are introduced and they stick with us until the end. \
When you realize the size of this plot .. well for me it's always a pleasure thinking about this anime. Nothing here is forgotten. Everything has a reason, everything has a explanation, and at Naruto Shipudden, you will realize how everything was connected since the beginning. \
They always move back and foward, so they really don´t stick with a time line. They often explore things deep into the past and by doing that, they always introduce new characters and new misteries to solve.  It is really an impressive plot. \
Art: 7/10. Well this anime is old, so either the background and the character design is not the best out there. Even though the animations are pretty well done for it's time. I really enjoyed the action despite of it's lack of detail. So i guess they didn´t failed that hard. \
The character design makes every single character unique, which for me is nice since there are animes out there were between the chracters, only the hair colour changes. \
And of course, this is a shonen so fan service takes place every once in a while. Personally i don´t dislike fan service, but for who does not like that, don´t worry. There isn´t to much. \
Sound: 9/10. The sound is engaging. It draws us into the action, which is such a nice feeling. Every single opening is well done. For the spirit os this anime (spirit of adventure) the openings are truly amazing. The tracks used are also great. They fit with the action, and they add something more to it. \
I would even say, the tracks used make this anime a litle bit epic when it comes to action. But well that is just my opinion. Anyways, i watched this anime 4 years ago and i still remember the openings and some tracks. So i guess they are memorable and so they are good. \
Character: 8/10. Well for a shonen .. we can not expect more. Pretty much standard characters. But take in mind. this anime was made almost 20 years ago, so back then, the cliche protogonist could not be so cliche as it is now.. Anyways the characters are enjoyable and almost all of them get a decent develop. It only fails when it comes to personalty and reactions. Unlike the plot, the characters are not that original, at least considering that nowadays they all are clichê. \
Enjoyment: 8/10. If there is one big problem .. is the comedy. Makes this show so childish and only breaks up the mood. The comedy is nothing more than stupid comedy, so it could be deleted from the anime that you wouldn´t miss it. Plus the last 2 or 3 arcs of this anime are fillers. I can´t ignore that. I didn´t watched it but they are there. I've only watched one arc, and it was so boring omfg .. \
The rest .. it's fucking amazing. I watched every single episode with a smile on my face of pleasure. Really enjoyable.. \
This show does not have an end.. it has a cliffhanger end to conect it with it's sequel, Naruto Shipudden. \
Overall: 8/10. Well i reccomend it ! I don´t give a crap about Naruto Shipudden, this show by it self is amazing and deserves a chance. You can skip and you may skip the fillers because they are useless. \
This show is a nice shonen, one of the best ! \

    Literally the best anime out there IN MY OPINION. I was about to give up and leave the anime community after trying to watch Sword arts online (SAO) & Dragon Ball (DB) but then I remembered narutos face and googled naruto and then said to myself I have to atleast watch this before I'm done with anime. I enjoyed the first episode a lot and I cried at the scene where Iruka saved Naruto and the sad soundtrack came on. Every since then this has been the favorite serie for me :)\
The soundtrack always come on at the right time, the characters look good and\
          \
        the voice acting is really good! I never regret watching naruto ^^ It changed me as a person a bit too, because they bring up a lot of stuff with friendship, teamwork etc.\
If you're bored, sad etc try watching naruto and you might get back on your feet again :D\
Thank for reading this review and if you did feel free to add me on MyAnimeList\

    Just to say, I've re-watched this show to completion about 2 times, and that's because, besides the good old nostalgia, it is actually a really good watch if you find yourself able to sit through such a long show. Now, I must warn that this is going to be a long review, but I'll add a summary of the things I liked and disliked of this show at the end.\
If like me, you find the most value in shows that give a lot of importance to their characters; this is definitely a reason to like Naruto. The protagonists, Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura are a group\
          \
        that evolves a lot trough the run of the show and are given a lot of character, but they are far from the only ones. However, there are many people that dislike this group of protagonists and I can get why. Sakura grows a lot, but the way she starts off, and even some of the traits she keeps until the very end of Naruto, are quite the annoyance. She sees herself as superior to Naruto at the beginning even if she's shown repeatedly that she can't do much to help her partners, is very off putting. Nevertheless, Sakura realizes this and makes a good effort to better herself for the sake of the team and her own, and that ties directly with the themes of the show of giving it your all to achieve a goal. Then, a Character I personally dislike is Sasuke Uchiha, Naruto's rival. The fact that his character plays such a massive role on this show makes his problems all the more apparent. However, it's much more bearable in Naruto than he is in Shippuden. He works well as to motivate Naruto to be better, beating Sasuke is another goal to reach, and Sasuke sees Naruto as a rival as well, something I appreciate. Now, the problem to me comes when at the end of the show, Sasuke's actions throw all his development out the window as it had never happened, and this very off-putting action is the driving force behind Shippuden. I must say that he does have some reasons to do this, but I don't think they're nearly enough to justify them. Moving to Naruto himself, I think he's a very strong protagonist and works amazingly, his backstory and determination makes the audience want to cheer for him, besides being a very funny character. He acts like the kid he is, in fact, they all do, which is a good bit of characterization since these characters are only 12 years old. \
Now, the supporting cast is by far the strongest I've ever seen. All of them have their own lovable and unique personalities, and are just as awesome, if not more, as the main cast. However, I have to address the problem of most female characters in this show; they're not given as much characterization as the others, with a few exceptions such as Hinata Hyuga.\
In what regards the villains, they are just great. Haku and Zabuza are personal favourites, just as the big bad guy of the show. They're all interesting and have believable motivations, aside from being capable of putting up great battles for the audience's enjoyment.\
Personally, I find the battles in Naruto are much more interesting in this show than the ones found in the sequel. This is due to the fact that these ninjas are still in training, so they have to use the few abilities they know creatively as to achieve victory. These battles are all really exciting, even if they drag a bit from time to time.\
Now, let's address the elephant in the room, the filler arcs. It's not as atrocious in Naruto as it will get in Shippuden, but there is a lot of filler, and it's mostly bad, with an exception being the episode where they try to see under Kakashi's mask. Luckily, skipping it is always an option.\
Then, there's the animation quality. This show is rather old, and its animation quality was never the best. I never gave much importance to those aspects of a show, but I know it can be off-putting for some people.\
A major point in favour of this show is its OST. If you go and listen to some, you'll notice their unique style given to them by the traditional instruments, and the amount of perfectly conveyed emotions each of these carries.\
Another point I'd like to address, is the sheer amount of emotions this show will make you feel. It's mostly a happy-go-lucky show, but it's more than capable of making you cry. In addition, it's far from a \"dumb\" show. One of its villains acts out of wanting to have a purpose for living pretty early in the show, and I loved it.\
Finally yet importantly, Naruto's story shows to be more than just his journey to becoming Hokage. It's a story that involves more than our protagonist, but the whole world they live in. It is not fully developed in Naruto as it is in Shippuden, but I must say the amount of things going on in Shippuden is overbearing, and Naruto is much easier to follow, and just as interesting.\
\
To sum up, I think it's worth watching as long as you can put up with its length. Its strongest point to me, being the characters, even if, in my opinion, it a few things wrong with these, it doesn't nullify the rest. Therefore, in addition to good action scenes, a great deal of emotions, comedy, and an easy to follow story, I hold this show very dear to my heart, even if the amount of filler and animation doesn't really help it.",

    Naruto is pretty famous anime and for the right reasons too.\
The show has beautiful story.\
It is fun to watch and the idea is unique too.The show does give some trouble in the beginning but believe me when I tell you this that it only gets better.\
Naruto is good and helps you drive into the show pretty smoothly but Naruto Shippuden is on an whole other level.\
It is so much better, not that Naruto is bad or anything.\
Anime really lets you have feeling of entire journey.\
From zero to hero.\

    When I first starting watching Naruto I thought I wasn't going to enjoy it and thought it was going to be a bad anime, but now I am watching Naruto Shippuden. I always hear that if you watch Naruto and enjoy it your weeb trash but Naruto had a great story, great characters, and it was very enjoying to watch. When Jirayia was introduced it made me think, so is this just the stereotypical perverted anime character? at first I did think it but when Jirayia started teaching Naruto I learned he is much more of a deep character. When Sasuke got the curse mark\
          \
        and became more powerful it made me think \"Is Sasuke now an equal to Naruto?\" due to me not knowing of Naruto being a Jinchuriki. When Naruto first had a the nine-tails chakra leaked out it left me confused. When Gaara was introduced I thought he was going to be a main villian but he turned out to be a Jinchuriki and be converted to the good side. So if you think Naruto is weeb trash watch it and you will most likely enjoy it.\

    Alternate viewpoint review: (SPOILERS and REALISM follows)\
Naruto is a young boy being raised in a Dystopian society where young children are trained to become assassins.\
The nations of the world sponsor shinobi villages where the self-ran villages each train a significant portion of the populace to become shinobi in the interest of securing income for that village.\
Naruto grows up in the Village Hidden in the Leaves, the first of the villages founded; and based upon the \"Will of Fire\" philosophy that puts village and the next generation ahead of the individual.\
They are certainly the \"good guys\" compared to the Mist Village where the children once ritualistically\
          \
        killed each other to achieve adulthood.\
At the start of the series, Naruto is an orphan who is also social outcast in his own village; for he had a 9-tailed fox (a powerful being who has caused many disasters in the past) placed into him as a baby.  Despite this being a village where freakish \"jutsus\"  (including infesting your body with parasitic insects, and supernatural abilities of illusion and murder) are the norm, Naruto is shunned for choices he did not make.\
Motivated to gain respect and acceptance amongst the people (with an absentee Godfather who's off womanizing, he has no support at home), Naruto seeks to become a great ninja and leader of the village.\
A lousy student, Naruto steals villages secrets to pass his studies and finds himself on a team with his rival Sasuke (an emo boy who only talks about murdering his brother), Sakura (infatuated with Sasuke, because murderous emos who ignore and belittle you are the hot item in this messed up village); and led by Kakashi; a man who lost all his teammates in battle and has been a black ops assassin ever since.\
The group trains and progresses.  Naruto progresses by tapping into the dark forces of the fox and by transforming into a naked, prepubescent girl to gain training from his neglectful godfather (who was supposed to train him to begin with).\
Sakura relies on passive-aggressive tendencies and is generally useless until much later; despite being a genius.  (good moral; Brains are useless, you just need to try hard to get everything)\
Sasuke relies heavily upon his family's legacy, eyes that allow him to learn jutsus and understand them naturally; that and years of murderous hate.\
The team faces their first struggle when they learn that the evil Orochimaru, a great former ninja of their village, seeks Sasuke's body.  At least they acknowledge something wrong with a man in his 60's proclaiming he needs a pubescent teenagers body.\
Rather than react to the creepy stalker and take action, they instead go on about business as usual; and the result is a terroristic attack where Orochimaru assassinates the Hokage (the village leader and his former teacher).\
During this, Naruto squares off against Gaara; another boy who had a monster placed into him.  Due to a brutal mindfucking by his own father, Gaara is a homicidal maniac (and unreliable assassin, nice job breaking it Kazekage!) but has his worldview shattered when Naruto proclaims he's fighting for his friends and defeats Gaara.  Sure, the fact that Naruto's monster has 9 tails and Gaara's only has 1 (a measurement of power) had nothing to do with it...\
Naruto then sets out with Pervy Sage (the aforementioned Godfather) to find a woman who should be the next Hokage.  The woman is Tsunade, a woman who is a compulsive gambler, frequent drinker, and spends a great deal of power to look over 30 years younger than she is.  Apparently these are great leadership qualities in this world!\
Then, as if to underline Naruto's arguments about the quality of friendship; Sasuke betrays them to run off and join Orochimaru to gain power, ignoring all the people he's killed and is offers his body in exchange for power.\
Sakura, always the team player, gets Naruto to vow to return Sasuke to the village; a move that puts both their lives at risk.  Enforcing the immature, \"treat broads like crap, and they love you\" philosophy at play.\
Much more happens, but basically Naruto has to deal with the fact that all the people in this world are permanently scarred (raising children to murder...nah, can't have anything to do with it right?) and is able to win people over to brighter point of view by just being a swell guy...or he kills them.\
\
Summary:  It's actually a great series, but I figure almost everyone who's into anime has seen or heard about this series.  I felt it was important to illustrate that this series is VERY disturbing once you get passed the silly Shonen antics.\

    story 5/10\
Naruto isn't that good... Why? How many anime have you seen with a main character not giving up to try to be the best? Loads of them, right? Naruto is no exception. How many anime have the same kind of characters as in Naruto? An annoying hothead, a never giving up guy, and a jerk-faced loser. My opinion is not superior to anyone elses. I know alot of people will disagree with me and I'm fine with it. Just don't whine about it and boast that I'm not right. I'm not right or wrong. So why did I give Naruto a 7 you ask?\
          \
        Simply because I enjoyed it.\
Art 6/10\
The art is pretty average most of the time. It looks like any other series. The fight scenes were really animated good. Especially Naruto and Sasuke's second fight.\
Sound 10/10\
The music really sets the mood in Naruto. Let it be joy, anger, sorrow. Especially sorrow and loneliness. Sometimes in my free time I like to listen to some of the beautiful songs in Naruto. \"Sadness and Sorrow\" for example, pulls at my heart strings whenever they play it. It's good at making you feel for the characters and making you cry.\
character 9/10\
The flashbacks were always interesting for me. I know lots of you thought the flashbacks were annoying. They were insightful for me. They helped me better understand the background of each character and feel what they're feeling. As for Sasuke, nobody cares about him so why did they put so much attention on him. I could care less about that little shih tzu. I liked the chunnin exams they were a great introductory on all the characters. On to the negative... I do not see any development in the characters. Sure there's background, but they do not seem to be growing into any different characters than they were from when the anime started. There's also a few ninja that were left out. Ten Ten for example, they don't go over her background or anything with her. She just like a filler character. Also Neji and Chouji seemed to be left out a bit too. You see Neji's backstory, he changes slightly but not a huge change. He still seems cold. Chouji is stuck playing the comic relief thorughout this anime. His backstory shows him to be kind but he doesn't get any other part but the comic relief. I would like to see some kind of thing going with him. Like a growing relationship with someone would be nice.\
Enjoyment 7/10 \
At first I was hesitant to watch this. I heard it had alot of fighting in it. I thought it was just fighting but it had more. Like friendship. My friend recommended it to me and eventually I started watching it. Naruto was boring at first but it stated picking up at about the chunnin exams, then I loved it. The world of Naruto felt like a whole other world to me and that's what I loved. I also like their fashion styles, like the fish nets and headbands. I absolutely love ninjas too. \
Overall 7/10\
If you took out all the fillers in Naruto, it would only be about 132 episodes instead of 220. If there weren't so many fillers it would be rated a 10 and I would definately watch it again. Watching fillers was torture, skip them at ALL COST. Things do drag on for too long. Like the fight between third and Orochimaru I was practically yelling at the screen. \"Drop dead already!!!  Come on! You're taking too long to die. So things drag on alot. Sometimes I don't mind it as much. It doesn't feel rushed and you can follow and understand the story at a slower pace. Other times I want it to hurry up and get moving.\
I definately wouldn't recommend this to everyone.\

    A lot of people who have not watched Naruto have probably heard of how crap it is or how many fillers there are.\
WELL. Naruto is probably as mainstream anime as you can get and as much as they drag the story on, I suppose it's quite necessary as they explain every aspect of every character's life. \
The whole story at first may seem to revolve about the main character, 'naruto', who wants to be the hokage of his village (hokage being the head/most strong ninja of the village), but as you get further into the story there are many minor arcs that involve all the\
          \
        characters. Many moral values are portrayed through the anime such as friendship, betrayal, loyalty, courage and all your typical heroic values. Such as never giving up even though you're spewing blood from your mouth.\
Though you should probably be prepared for the one fight carrying on for 10+ episodes, normal for any mainstream anime.\

    Naruto...\
What can I say? Next to pokemon, Naruto is a classic.  Especially for people who grew up watching it. Now I don't do reviews often so take that in to consideration while you're reading this\
Naruto is set in a fictional world where ninja roam the land and use techniques called 'jutsu' to amplify their performance. To do this ninja need chakara (similar to kainin DBZ) which is basically their life's essence. Everyone has it, but ninja know how to harness it.\
Story:10\
Naruto is a story about a boy with the same name. The story centers around him and hos friends. As it progresses you see\
          \
        everyone maturing and getting stronger as well as bonds deepening. Yhe story is brilliantly complied into it's own arcs, with fillers being in its own arc. You will see rulers rise and fall. Enemies and organizations Being destroyed or created. And all this is happening to a growimg ninja boy\
Art: 7\
The art was very unique in some episodes. However, you'll mostly see the same kind of background and clothing in the anime. There isn't too much diversity, but when there is, it's extravagant. Just get used to the sight of either a forest, rocky or barren terrain as the fight scenes have all of them\
sound: 9\
The sounds as well as the music were all amazing. You hear some repeats from there but everything was great. From the dialogue,  to the intro and outro music, to the sound effects of the fighting! The sounds definitely make this anime that much more amazing\
Character: 10\
Each and (almost) every character is improved upon. Even Sakura herself yes. Those who don't need improvement have wonderfully thought out backstories that are impossible to know NOT know. I can't think of any suggestions when it comes to this\
Enjoyment: 10\
The anime never stops to cease to amaze me. Even after taking a 2-4 year break from it, I came back. Back to the 1st big fight scene between Naruto and Sauske. I wanted to skip fillers and other non-canon episodes so that I can have more time with shippuden. But I couldn't.  Thats how enjoyable Naruto is...\
Final score: 9- Great\
This anime hit the mainstream market and is praised by many for good reason. It is a one of a kind action comedy anime. Perhaps it may be for you or it may not. Who knows, you can be the next guy/gal running around with their hands behind their back ;)\

    When I first watched Naruto, I was amazed by all its glory. I was completely speechless of its humor, how great its art is, etc. etc. I was a total newbie to anime, for Naruto was one of my first anime I've watched.\
What made me eventually grew out of Naruto is its fanbase. Naruto x Sasuke this, Sasuke that. It made me pissed off. The story was overall great, but the art, to be honest, it's not that great.

    This is my first review, and I might be a bit jumpy and in-cohesive, so I would like to apologize before you read any further. This is also the first anime I ever really watched, although my opinion of it has changed over the years.\
When I first watched Naruto, I was completely obsessed. For days on end, I would complete tons of episodes, entranced by the plot, the characters, the fights, the emotional tug, and the sheer ecstasy I felt by seeing Naruto win over his battles. There is always something magical about seeing someone being shunned for so long find something greater than blank,\
          \
        cruel stares. Yet, at the same time, I was too naive in the anime world. I had no way to compare such things as story, art, sound, etc. Naruto was the best because it was the only one.\
Surprisingly, as I ventured into less well-known anime, my view of Naruto became a bit more critical. My initial amateur eyes that adored that yellow-haired boy and his adventures judged the not-so-amazing art, the lack of intense emotional appeal or response, and its amount of fillers (there are quite a few). The fact that Naruto was one of the so-called \"Big Three\" was enough for me; that in itself shot its rank up my list. That is, until I began to realize maybe it's so popular because it's quite an easy anime to accept? I am still not sure, but I do not want to deny it has been a good enough anime for me.\
Story: 7/10\
Just from the synopsis alone, anyone should be able to realize the story will have at least some depth in it. Beneath the usual light and comical air Naruto tends to bring on screen is a darker secret that he tries his best to hide his pain and loneliness. That already makes a powerful story, something many viewers can watch and learn from. Naruto teaches many lessons, especially about not giving up. Perhaps what makes it so popular is Naruto's continuous drive to find acceptance. So much of the anime revolves around that goal, but that then makes so much of it quite amazing.\
I may be slightly judgmental here, but given the black/white nature of Naruto, there seems to be a bit of a skew. It is easy for the anime to be easygoing, but it seems to need something sad in order to develop its other side. That seems to be quite ironic because Naruto's life for a long time was one without friends and light. At the same time, I would understand it because in a way Naruto is trying to move on, but it just feels like the pain and suffering endured in the past is forced by their current circumstances (if that even made sense).\
Art: 6/10\
I realize if I reviewed this anime years ago when I first watched it, I would probably give it a 9 or 10. The art was not heavenly, the battles were not that epic (some were), and sometimes it just seems the artists did not put too much effort in. To summarize, I've seen better.\
Sound: 7/10\
Generally when I watch anime, I do not pay too much attention to music, but it does heighten certain feelings when played in the right time. Naruto does a good job, especially during moments of sadness. Those for me stand out the most. For the rest of the moments, though, the music just blends in. It is not particularly super, but not bad either.\
Character: 7/10\
Character development is pretty good. A lot of time is spent on main characters' pasts which add depth and understanding. Although not everybody gets their fair share on the spotlight, enough is given and explained.\
Enjoyment: 6/10\
I personally enjoy deep plots. Naruto had a focus on that, with its emphasis on Naruto's past suffering and pain, but at the same time the amount of deviation from its original standpoint somewhat irritated me. In other words, I didn't really like all of the fillers. Sometimes they provided more background, which was nice, but usually they were out-of-the-blue and did nothing to the storyline at all.\
Overall: 7/10\
Maybe if Naruto was the 5th anime I watched and not the 1st, it would have been ranked lower. However, I feel the beauty of this anime comes from its huge popularity. It's widely known throughout the world (probably), and that's what makes it unique. Sure it is not the best anime out there, but it does deserve some respect for being so... natural. It's one of the most natural anime out there. Give it a shot.\

I truly liked how the characters developed over time through all the events that occur. The action&hellip; AMAZING! The choregraphy that&rsquo;s done is great and well thought out, so every moment of the anime you can appreciate the art and hard work that is being shown right in front of you. Of course, I always watch my anime SUBBED because I want to avoid Dubs as much as possible as it personally feels like it ruins the\
          \
        original work as it revamps anime as cartoons for children. So I gladly get to dodge all of the &ldquo;Believe its!&rdquo; getting to enjoy the anime much more. The only thing that was an obstacle for me was the pacing of FLASHBACKS. It really bugged me that in the middle of the intensity of a fight they break off to a flashback to explain a character&rsquo;s motive for fighting or whatnot. Towards the end, the pacing becomes an amazing story arc leading up to the present &ldquo;Shippuden&rdquo; series, where the flashback sequences are appropriately placed for correct pacing which makes me feel better in the long run. Naruto is a strange character, yet his morales and drive as a young genin makes you want to root for him, so I became really drawn in to follow his journey until the end. May the chronicles continue!\

    To say that I was bored when I typed Naruto into Youtube would be a little understated. I have been watching Keroro Gunso For a whole week, my computer was just fixed( watched Keroro Gunso on the PS3 web browser), and I have no real friends would make me completely bored out of my skull when I typed in Naruto…even though I never regretted it. \
Naruto follows the plot of every single Shonen to date. A Young man has something that no one else has, he begins to use the thing to fight his way to the top of his imaginary society, and he will\
          \
        be fighting off against his best friend or family members soon. In this Anime’s Case, Naruto has a demon, he uses it’s chakra(spiritual energy if I am right) to get his way to become the leader(Hokage) of his Ninja Village.\
While watching the first episode, I was honestly surprised to find the Japanese voices to be a bit annoying, so I switched to the Dubbed version and even was more surprised to find I actually liked it. The voices fit the characters well(But some of the characters sound a little too old for their age) and the script wasn’t half bad and it wasn’t censored so much that to explain the dead bodies, they say their ‘sleeping’.\
The storyline is pretty much standard, but it picks up enough after the first story arc and I get pulled in after the rookie 9 meet for the first time. That takes…20 episodes.\
You might be asking why I stayed in that long if the story was standard fare. And I will say because the characters are incredibly easy to relate to and even easier to like, if not love.\
Naruto is pretty interesting as a main character in his own little way, and Sasuke can probably make all the girls in the world rise up and cheer if he just kisses Naruto again, and Sakura…well…doesn’t do anything but otherwise she stays out of the way most of the time and is interesting in her own way. \
The other main character is Kakashi, the most kickass teacher in the whole F’in world. He is mysterious and yet not moody, He is incredibly powerful but not arrogant, he has a great sense of humor without trying too hard. In fact, You could have given the entire series to Kakashi and he would probably have the same(if not better) success as naruto. \
The supporting characters are just as good, and all of them have a great back story and deserve to have the praise and fan fiction they get and more.\
But every series has it’s downfalls for people…and for some it’s worth not watching a great anime.\
The first problem(complaint) is that Naruto is filled with Fillers. And I honestly say that the popularity of Naruto thrives on Fillers. To point out why I think that, lets compare two animes that are known for Fillers.\
Dragon Ball Z\
A huge fight at the beginning…and then we wait the entire season for at least something like that to happen again. Meanwhile, We get to train! And Train some more! And we get to watch Goku learn two boring moves and when he finally uses them, they are nothing but wimpy when used on the two enemies where only ONE was damaged.\
Naruto\
The Fillers show more of the character themselves and I can’t distinguish one filler episode from just a regular one. Naruto has fillers filled with character development that I love and cherish(Except for that kid in episode 2, I smiled when he cried at the Hokage funeral =)  )\
The Second problem is that Naruto has stereotypical characters. I admit, many of the characters that Fans like all have some sort of troubled past or they watched their entire village get slaughtered(WINK). But Yet again, I am not picky and all the characters are stereotypical in a way that isn’t obvious as some other animes.\
The Third problem is that Naruto is copying off from other anime, which I find silly because Anime is always the same really. In fact, most of the anime you find will  look incredibly similar story wise. But Anime is special in that the characters are always new and fresh and can easily be related to. Naruto is no exception.\
The Fourth and final problem is the flashbacks, and I honestly can say that you will get a flashback about every 5 to 10 minutes! And the flashbacks always focus on what happened in the last episode. There is a point where we already have gotten five different aknoledgments from the characters of what happened, we need a flashback on what just happened. \
In short, Naruto is a anime that you will enjoy if you are open minded and want something new. You won’t like it if your complaining about the characters jumpsuit and you don't like Ninjas.\
That means your a Pirate guy right?",

           Now, first off, I am not going to claim that Naruto is bad. I know a lot of people who would, but I won't. I also will not explain the plot, because once I start it gets hard to stop. What I am going to talk about is how Naruto lost me. It used to hold a very special place in my heart, because it was the anime that got me to look it up on the web, and finally discover what anime was and where to find it. I don't know how long it would have taken\
          \
        for that to happen otherwise, but it was the catalyst. Back in the day I was a diehard Naruto fan. Now, I'm going to start with what is good about the anime.\
     The action is very good, and while I generally prefer One Piece and a couple other anime in that department, it's still well done. The music is very good, and gets you ready for a good time. The best thing, easily, are the characters. The cast is large and there are quite a few stand outs. Rock Lee is a personal favorite, but almost all of the main cast are very well done. Naruto himself is a great protagonist. When they delve into his childhood, it really works. The Zabuza storyline is probably the peak in quality,  but the Chunin Exams/Gaara arc is my favorite. The ending fight works very well, though I've seen the same idea done better elsewhere. (Keep that in mind, I'll bring it up again in a couple of days.)\
    Now for the bad. To start off, the problem with the great cast is that the writer has no clue how to focus. As time goes on, he spends less and less time with the initial cast that drew us in, and keeps throwing in new characters, only about one in ten of which are a fifth as good as the original characters. I don't want to spend more time with Sai, I want Hinata! For the anime the filler is atrocious, between Naruto and Shippuden literally a year and a half of filler. Some of it was good, but most was really bad, and because it was filler it was a year and a half where nothing of real importance could happen. Then there's the Sasuke problem. I didn't like Sasuke at first, but by the end of the Zabuza arc he had grown on me. But then the Sasuke retrieval arc reared it's ugly head, and now I can't stand the guy. And it got worse! Every time he's shown up since then he's made me more and more pissed. At one point it started to feel like Sasuke was supposed to be the protagonist, but luckily it switched perspectives again soon after. Plus, after the initial success of Zabuza and Gaara, I haven't liked the villains much. Orochimaru started off cool, but degraded fast. The Akatsuki didn't really impress me.\
   The thing that gets me the worst though is the story. Over time, the plot has become more and more sidetracked and convoluted. It keeps going off-course, and not resolving what it's set up. Off everything that has happened so far, I think only the tailed beasts and Naruto's parents were things the writer knew when he started. Like I said earlier, the Gaara fight felt satisfying because it felt like it was built up to, and everything fit just right. I haven't felt that since, and that is a shame. Let me compare this with the anime I talked about yesterday, One Piece. One Piece set up huge plot points years in advance, in one case decades, and did so where it usually wasn't obvious that Oda was leading us there.\

    Naruto is amazingly awesome.  Until you get to the part that is completely overrun by filler.\
Everything besides the filler of this show is truly good.  The story is well-designed, the art, sound effects, and music are all very high quality. The show really shines in terms of characters, featuring many characters who all express pretty good development. The story does kinda span over what seems like too many episodes, but for the most part it does deliver high quality action and character interaction very effectively.  Well, until you get to the non-canon filler.\
Despite the fairly low rating I'm giving this anime, I\
          \
        must stress that several of the most impressive moments in anime history do occur here. Character interaction at some points has never been better, and depending on the type of person you are, this anime does have the potential to bring tears to your eyes as your mind is blown away by what could be the most appropriate ending to the best fight scene you may have seen in your entire life.\
Really though, you have to wonder the logic behind several of the filler episodes. It's possibly the dumbest thing that happened to what could have been one of the highest quality shows in existence.\

    This was my gateway series. I had watched a lot of anime in the mid 90's but gave it up completely. I reluctantly started this series thanks to a persistent friend. This is the first part of the Naruto Manga (up until the time skip for his 2+ years of training). This is one of those anime that is difficult to turn off because it's just so good. This is yet another series that has established itself as a timeless classic right up there with Dragonball.\
The violent world of the ninja in this series is filled with surprisingly rich characters. There is a lot of\
          \
        comedy and a lot of drama. This series takes you through a full range of emotions, and the psychology of the battles that these 12 and 13 year old kids endure is amazing. The battles are clever and not necessarily done in real time so you can gain insight into how each character handles the situations move by move. The graphic and violent nature of this series makes it a crime that the english dubs target younger audiences. \
One of the biggest themes in this series is comradery. Naruto is an orphan that is hated by his village due to the incident surrounding his birth. He has to form bonds with others pretty much by overcoming one hardship after another. He earns his friendships through blood, sweat, and tears. The respect he gains is admirable, and he seems to do it while being a little slow on the uptake. The overall message remains heartwarming throughout. The message really is a good one.\
If you must watch this series I advise picking up the \"uncut\" version. The last couple of seasons are almost 100% filler, so I do advise watching this filler free. The story from the Manga is adapted very well if you skip over the filler. I know some would argue that point with me, but it stays close to the Manga without filler, and the manga is a near masterpiece. \

    The story line for Naruto was one that I'd never seen before. Kishimoto was very creative in creating an intricate world and background story for all of the important characters. The art isn't outstanding. But at time where the characters are engaging in battle you have to sit back and watch the great visual show. The characters in Naruto are of the most unique and well developed I've ever seen. Kishimoto is a specialist in the 'dreaded flashbacks' but those flashbacks make the characters we're watching so in depth that Naruto has become a phenomenon as cosplaying and especially fanfictions (which happens to be a\
          \
        secret pleasure of mine)\
Another point of Naruto that makes it very popular with your modern day otaku is the jutsu's. I praise Kishimoto's creative ability for creating jutsu's that play on characters different strengths, bloodlines and topology.\
At times the plot can take far longer to unfold in the anime then it does in the manga which can lead to fillers. I believe that if Naruto had less fillers it would have more fans than it does. But for the true fans that find a character they can associate with (almost everyone can) Naruto is an enjoyable experience and is well on it's way to becoming a classic. \
The music for naruto also adds to the experience. The opening songs can be of the best and worst around. I know that I have a few personal favourites. The music during the program adds to the emotion of what is happening in the scene. It also seems that many characters have their own theme songs which is always entertaining.\
Overall I give Naruto a 7 for a often heartwarming and heart wrenching story about an outcasts struggle to be accepted and never take no for an answer when it means reaching your dreams. \

    There are few shows that I can watch without wanting to turn off the TV at least once. Everyone show has it's point where it just gets a little silly. However, Naruto is one of the few shows, minus the endless filler at the end, that I just can't stop watching. \
I first watched Naruto after enjoying plenty of other great anime series and I was still surprised at how awesome it is. It does have some cliches but everything does at this point. What makes it stand out is the characters and a really interesting plot line. IMO, you cannot do wrong watching this\
          \
        show. It's one of the best!\

    While I do agree that Naruto is the most overhyped anime in history, I can't deny the fact that there is some good in this original series. What made fans like me back then so interested in this anime was the main character himself, Naruto. In some ways a lot of people could identify with Naruto due to the lonely childhood he experianced when everyone in the village hated him for carrying a demon spirit inside him. This makes us feel pity for him, and also sets up his role in the series as the hated underdog who never gives up. Throughout this series Naruto\
          \
        and his friends overcome harsh obstacles in their life after they are first introduced into the dangerous world outside their village. Their vulnerability and inexperience keeps us guessing and curious about how they overcome adversity from their foes, when faced with the battle of life and death. \
A perfect example of this would be the first arc of this story, The Land of Waves, as they travel on their first A-rank mission. When given the chance to return to the village, Naruto vows to carry on this mission by stabbing his hand after he was poisoned by rogue ninjas. This vow shows us his unwillingness to give in, even when it comes to puting his life on the line. This is the point where we start to admire the character and cheer him on throughout the rest of the story. The same types of character development can also be seen by the other two main role characters, Sasuke and Sakura. (Although after Sakura does develop an arc in this series, she does remain the same pitiful character throughout the rest of the series). Sasuke in particular, was also a character people could care about, because although we do know that he was the most skilled ninja coming out of his class, we also feel his pain and despair when his motivation is introduced later on in the series.\
Other characters include Hatake Kakashi (the three character's sensei), and the surrounding cast of other ninjas in their class. Kakashi can be a well-liked character because of his past experience and leadership with the three, while the other surrounding cast can be just as likeable when they go through certain arcs in their life and eventually team up with the three main characters when a conflict arises.\
Another good point that should be mentioned in this series is the music. This, in my opinion, is the most underrated part of this series. Songs like Sound and Strike and Sadness and Sorrow were key in exemplifying  the mood in certain action scenes, as well as scenes of sadness. This gets us more involved in the scene and interested in what happens next.\
Unfortunately what brings this anime down to a 7 is the tedious and mediocre filler arcs that follow after episode 135. Since this anime closely follows the manga, there was a point where the anime eventually caught up, and had to wait for the author to pick up on his story. The result eventually led to the tedious story arcs that ran from episode 136 to 220. These arcs had no relation to the story or the characters as they continued to repeat the same plot elements from the previous arcs before them.\
Although a lot of us can agree that Naruto Shippuden has taken this series downhill since (which is a darn shame), I do think that people should not overlook the original series, and at least try to watch it whenever they get the chance. There's a reason why it is well liked by many, and should at least be considered before looking at the colossal mess in Shippuden.\

    To be honest, I used to be obsessed with this anime. Literally. I would never watch any other AMVs besides the ones that included Naruto; I thought everyone who hated Naruto were idiots; I thought Sasuke was so hot, etc...\
But the thing is, I only enjoyed it up until a certain number of episodes. The reason for this is, it got boring. In my opinion, anyway.\
I think that they should've ended the anime at a certain spot. They shouldn't have put so many filler episodes, and Kishimoto shouldn't have made Naruto: Shippuden.\
But, I do think the plot is great. It had a lot of potentional.\
          \
        The characters were a bit cliche, but still enjoyable. The art could've been better, but it wasn't horrible.\
I think the thing that ruined it for me, is that the story dragged on and on until finally they ended it to make a Naruto:Shippuden. Also, I was soooo into it that I guess I finally got sick of it.\
Overall, this anime isn't horrible, but it's far from great. I do think that if you haven't seen it, you should still give it a try.\

    Naruto is exactly the epitome of what's wrong with shounen anime/manga the same way Bleach and Dragon Ball were flawed. YES I realize these three anime, however flaws they may have, are iconic and staple mainstream anime... but if you stopped to think about the story REALLY, they're not very good.\
Naruto starts off strong and likable as a series altogether. The show however uses a bad trope that ruins most shounen stories; escalation and one upping the previous arc with a stronger enemy. And the protagonist becoming stronger by rinse/repeating what they did previous arcs is how they show character growth? So dumb. \
I know\
          \
        most people complain about fillers but I don't even need to. Even without the fillers, this anime gets it so horribly wrong. By the end, they lost sight of what this anime was even about in the beginning. Sure he wants to be Hokage but honestly that's so vague and general in the grand scheme of things going around our character. Also how this anime holds your hands like a baby? Do we really need a flashback to the last episode 3 times in one episode?\
Naruto is trash; there's a lot to like about Naruto but ultimately it isn't very good. If you MUST know what happens in Naruto, just read the manga so you won't at least waste your time. This show is so cringe worthy too; like if a giant monster is attacking you and you just took a fatal blow to save someone, you're going to die or the monster will go after you. It's not going to let you sit there and allow for a crying sappy 10 minute scene.\
Stay far away from Naruto. Go watch Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. It's actually a good shounen and holds up well. Also, shows like FMA does NOT use the terrible \"escalation\" trope where the character's growth and journey is parallel to their growth of strength/power like some bad Dragon Ball fanfic.\

    Naruto is SOOOOOO popular. All anime fans know of Naruto. Even non anime fans know about Naruto. \
I'm always surprised when I see that someone has never heard of Naruto before. \
\
Anyway..................Story: 10/10 \
The good thing about Naruto is the UNIVERSE. There are many villages, the villages have ninjas who can use jutsu. Jounin, Chuunin, Genin, Hokage, ANBU....\
And the awesome story where\
Character:10/10\
 the main character is a lonely orphan with a demon fox sealed inside him, so the entire village hates him. That's an impressive fact. Naruto. \
And the other main character is a boy who's older brother killed his entire family/clan. Wow. Sasuke.\
The third\
          \
        main character is a normal girl with nothing special about her and a hell annoying personality. OK. Sakura. Boring 0/10 \
So Sakura gets a lot of hate. But the good thing about this character is that she gives us a lot to expand upon, if we use our imagination or write fanfiction like Sakura's Glasses where you can give her the Sharingan or whatever powers you want or place her wherever you want in the plot or make her get trained by Obito or something. 10/10 \
\
Basically this is the best anime because it lets readers get creative with the characters and make fanart, fanfiction, doujinshi, yaoi, etc. \
So even if the story is lame, the universe is good and makes up for the rest. \
And it's still an interesting story. JUST, make sure you skip all the fillers because it has nothing to do with the story, it's a waste of time unless you don't mind comedy episodes (for me it's hard to humor me and I hate all things comedy so I hate fillers,) \
Then it will be good. \
I enjoyed it 10/10 \

    I liked and enjoyed this anime a lot, because I was quite captivated and also because I had a lot of fun, its characters, its music and even its history, maybe I was very interested in the history of some characters, such as the story of Sasuke, Among others, there are also moments of comedy, especially in the stuffing, but the most serious in this anime, is that Sasuke betrays the village, goes with the sound equipment, a dangerous gang of the Shinobi world, while Naruto and Sakura They are worried about this boy in blue clothes and black hair, Sasuke, one day after the\
          \
        tragic moment, Shikamaru has a mission, which is Sasuke's recovery mission, and forms a group for the mission, there are 5 boys, who They are Naruto, Neji, Choji, Kiba and what the leader of the group is Shikamaru, since he graduated in Chunin, shortly after the battles of these 5 boys, in the battle between Naruto and Kimimaro, is involved Rock Lee, is Because he is The hospital's cape, ran and ran, as I said, intervenes in the battle, and fights with Kimimaro with all his strength, while Shikamaru and Choji continue to struggle with their energies, although Naruto is looking for Sasuke everywhere, after All that, the team arrives from the sand village, of which they are Gaara, Kankuro and Temari, because they are about to save Rock Lee, Kiba and Shikamaru, so that they last more years, and these easily defeat the sound equipment, although Neji and Choji were the ones who defeated the Two of the first of this sound equipment, which are Kidomaru and Jirobo\
And when Naruto finally reached Sasuke's footsteps, they decided to make a very strong battle, and the part that caught my attention in this battle between them is when Naruto and Sasuke are transformed to the maximum prepare their techniques to the maximum power And energy, attacking from hand to hand, that Naruto was using the Rasengan and Sasuke the Chidori, and this is the moment that I liked the most of this anime, my favorite saga is the invasion of Konoha, that is where Naruto and Gaara They fight, but in fact my favorite saga is the Sasuke Recovery Mission, there I am called the attention.\
And for this reason, it's my second favorite anime.\

Naruto is a show that many have grew up with, many people love this anime and I have lots of friends who told me Naruto was the first anime they've watched, even Naruto was the first anime I've watched. But enough of bias opinions, I'm here to tell you whether or not you should watch this show.\
Story:\
The story is simple to follow and isn't difficult to understand, although some points in the story it's starts to downgrade and begins to become a bit sloppy, the show\
          \
        is 220 episodes long and does it ever feel to slow down? Yes it does sometimes, I wasn't completely upset by this as I still enjoyed the story till it's finish line.\
Overall: 7\
Art:\
The animation unfortunately isn't very consistent, it sometimes dips in quality and can look really bad sometimes, other times it can look great where it's concentrated at best, some of the fight scenes in this show can be done good or bad. thankfully the majority of them are good(in my opinion at least) \
Overall: 6\
Sound:\
The music in this show really is one of the best aspects about this show, the most notable one is probably the sad tones which stand out the most, especially in emotional scenes. Even when the battles start the music gets you pumped up and excited.\
Overall: 8\
Character:\
There is a large cast of characters in this show, there are some good and some bad characters, Naruto can be found annoying sometimes and it's easy to see why, the character designs are unique and it's an underrated aspect of the show, each character looks and sounds different, with different morals and goals which makes the characters so beloved in the Naruto series.\
Overall: 7\
Enjoyment:\
You can enjoy the series a lot, watching Naruto getting better and learning from his mistakes gives you a feeling of happiness, unfortunately the show has a lot of fillers which are one of the biggest drawbacks of this show, fortunately you can easily skip these episodes by searching online filler and non-filler episodes of Naruto and you can end up enjoying the series a lot.\
Overall: 8\
So should you watch this show? Yes, It's a show with many flaws but can still enjoy it on certain level, just don't have high expectations or you will be severely disappointed.         \

    Naruto is a delightful anime which is most definitely fun for all ages. Don't get me wrong, it can't be considered a masterpiece which has transcended the Shounen genre. However, to deny Naruto's impact on the anime world is foolish.\
For many people (including myself) Naruto was the gateway into watching anime with more depth than the Shounen Jump series. But what is it that makes Naruto such a great gateway anime to watch? Is it the characters who can come off as either incredibly layoured (think Itachi) and the enjoyable (if not basic) story telling or is it simply down to the remarkable action scenes\
          \
        and animation which the show can sometimes offer.\
Personally I find the entire journey that our protagonist goes on riveting from start to finish. The characters around them and the way they affect him are real to the story. Whilst the protagnonist can come off as an annoying brat near the start of the show the emotional depth that is layered upon him keeps the viewer rooting for the little guy to win. \
The supporting cast can be a mixed bag with some characters having incredibly detailed backstorys and depth and some falling flat as little more than comic relief or exposition drops (looking at you Tenten). In the later series some of the characters who were built up in Naruto also seem to drop off the map in favour for a more streamlined focus on Naruto and his rival Sasuke Uchiha which can be polarizing at best.\
While the supporting cast can range from excellent to lackluster, one thing which Naruto suceeds over most Shounen anime is the incredible variety of villains which the show has to offer, most of which come with incredibly deep and heartbreaking backstories which perfectly parallel our protagonist. Whether it is the perfect opposite of Naruto in the form of Gaara to the incredible range shown from the Akatsuki, you will always find yourself accidentally rooting for the protagonist to win.\
The world itself I feel is also deep and meaningful to the story of Naruto. Whether it dates as far back as the story of the Sage of the Six Paths or more recent events such as the Nine Tailed Fox's attack on the Hidden Leaf, almost everything has a connection to the story and doesn't feel entirely forced.\
In summary, Naruto is a charming little anime to watch if you want to have a good time. It is not entirely groundbreaking (taking the global success of the series out of the equation) but if you are like myself, you might find yourself having an enjoyable ride with this show.\

    I'm partial to Naruto, given the nostalgia that surrounds it, but in all honesty it's not impressive. However, a generation was moved by the story and experience. In my personal opinion, if something is that powerful to that many people, it must have done something right, even if it was an accident.\
Naruto in general is very good at harnessing the anticipation of progression. It's skill isn't as refined as others, and it tends to be rough around the edges, but throughout the series (so long as you aren't too sceptical) you'll generally be hanging on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, it does suffer from\
          \
        a severe issue with length. The series is tough to enjoy if you aren't going through it at a blistering pace, and it's held back by the fact that each episode needs to be twenty minutes, and you can't move any faster than that.\
The series is also good at delivery, at least in the first half. Each arc has a sense of motion, and each has a thing to teach the main protagonist. Unfortunately, a little more than halfway through the series it cuts into a long chain of filler episodes, and it doesn't resume canon until the sequel series Naruto: Shippuden. This wouldn't be that bad, except for most of the filler episodes the quality is drastically lowered, and there isn't much story progression. That alone lowers the score of this review.\
The story itself was creative for its time, and it definitely is an interesting direction for a setting to travel in. This is less indicative of Naruto than it is a trend in long-runners themselves. In general the longest running series will have the best world building by virtue of inertia. Naruto stands out in that it immerses you in the premise within the span of a single episode, allowing you to better enjoy what is to come. However, by not having a slow burn like Bleach, it leaves the main circle of characters unattached. It isn't until about 60 episodes in, when the second real arc ends, that you finally get to know all of the major characters involved in the series, and it isn't until the very last arcs that they are really utilized to their fullest. Even if all of the characters have unique and interesting personalities, without introducing the audience to them, the audience will never learn to like them.\
By far the best aspect of the show is its music and voice acting. A lot of big names in the industry got their start or were involved in Naruto as of it's original run, dubbed and in the original Japanese, including people like Nana Mizuki or Yuri Lowenthal. On the music side of things, most of the songs are classic. I consider the soundtrack of Naruto to be great considering they only had about 40 songs to work with for about three times as many episodes. That's not including the openings, though, which were hit and miss.\
I enjoyed it a lot when I watched it as a kid. It doesn't hold up to that nostalgia as well as it could, but it's far from awful, and I think if you're not used to casting a critical eye on things, it could be the kind of show for you. Even if you are critical, I've seen some recuts that fix pacing issues and such - the show may not be all that bad if you watch it with the intent of skipping flashbacks or filler.\
Either way, your enjoyment is up to you.\

    One day in 2009, I was talking to a friend about anime.\
I talked about Evangelion, Rurouni Kenshin, Cardcaptors, Dragon Ball Z.\
He started talking about Bleach, One Piece and Naruto. I asked him \"Hey man, could you give me something similar to DBZ?\" and he replied with Naruto. \
Went home and popped up a site to watch and honestly, other than a few other obscure series, I have never been so bored in my life. You got some kid with whiskers on his face and acts like a baby, a pink haired wash board who's just a b**** and some emo that tries to be so\
          \
        edgy but just ends looking dumb AF. \
So I dropped the series and subsequently in the following years, I'd see the emergence of this series in the West and honestly I fail to see what people like about it. It's constantly ripping DBZ off and tries to be serious and ends up flat like Sakura's chest.\

    Naruto, since it was the anime that i grew up with and the first anime that i watched completely i rated it high, and it was worth but good for it when i watched it i didnt know what fillers were but still worth the 8 i gave it.\
So as i said Naruto is my introduction to the anime world so i should be thankluf for that.\
The story is not very bad but the long and unnecessary fillers kinda ruined it, especially the last ones.\
The animation i rated it with a 7 beacuse i am not some expert or professional so i did not mind\
          \
        it that much. I cant guarantee that u will rate it as high as i did. \
The sound is just too good both the intros and outros are great but even the in-anime sound are great.\
Characters are not the best but i like them beacuse they have a reason for their doings such as the main characters and the villains.\
Enjoyment- Yup i did enjoy it \
Overall- a very good anime (my opinion) that is worth the time.\

    Minor Spoilers here read at own risk\
Just a heads up I skipped all but one episode of filler for Naruto. So my opinions are just of the canon.  \
The story of Naruto is actually quite hard to explain. It follows 5 canon story arcs. The Prologue arc, The Chunin Exam Arc, The Konoha Crush Arc, The Tsunade Arc and the Sasuke Retrieval arc. Each arc has its own complex story that tends to build off of the previous arc. It's done very well actually, to the point where I didn't realize that the Konoha Crush arc happened. I had thought for the longest time\
          \
        that it the Konoha Crush arc was a part of the Chunin Exam arc. Some could see this as a problem, the show failing to show the start of a new arc. I think I was just being stupid lol. Each story arc has its own ups and down. I could be here all day talking about them. In my opinion the Chunin Exam arc and the Sasuke Retrieval Arc are definitely the best.  \
One thing I wanna highlight is Naruto's great character development and how the anime shows you his character development. All of the main arc antagonist act as foils to Naruto. In the beginning of the anime, Naruto is selfish. One of the two main arc \"villains\" is the exact opposite of Naruto at this point. Haku's dream to help Zabuza achieve his dream. Every single action Haku does, he does for his friend. In the Chunin Exam arc, Naruto believes that anyone can become strong if they try hard enough. He believes in his strength and the strength of his friends. Two characters that Naruto believes in are Hinata and Rock Lee. The main arc antagonist, Neji, believes that people, like Naruto and his friends are born failures and will always be failures. The Knoha Crush arc, Gaara fights for only himself, Naruto fights to protect his friends. You get the idea. Each arc villain is used to show how much Naruto has grown as a ninja and as a person. He learns to care about his friends over anything else, which is a huge difference from when he started.    \
I will be the first to admit, Naruot's main three characters are very annoying at times. You have the bratty Naruto, the edgey Sasuke and the useless Sakura. To make up for having three somewhat unlikable main characters, you have a butt load of side characters. Kiba, Shino, Hinata, Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, Neji, Rock Lee, TenTen, and much much more. So there is bound to be one character you will end up liking. For me it was Shikamaru, Gaara, and my favorite Naruto character, Rock Lee. \
But despite having a large cast of side characters, the female characters almost as a whole are boring and useless. Its really sad, Sakura and Ino are just carbon copies of each other, except Ino is a little more mean. TenTen does nothing at all in the canon episodes. I think she has one fight and then is only seen again to explain minor things to the audience. Hinata is a really interesting character, but is under used. Temari is a really fun character that gets some cool fights, but is also under used. The coolest female character doesn't appear till the fourth main story arc. It's saddening to see no real effort put into the female side characters. \
The Op's For Naruto are pretty good for the most part. They are really fun at times and help to show the theme of some of the story arcs. Though Op 6, 7, 8, 9 are during filler so they don't have that much to work with sadly. That leads to op 7 and 8 being pretty disappointing for the most part. Despite taking place during filler, Op 9 has become a fan favorite. Due to it's impressive use of silhouette fight scenes in the op. Personal favorites of mine are Op 3 and 5. Op 3 because it shows a clear theme of moving on with your past and getting trough loneliness. And Op 5 because it is just a really fun op that does foreshadow a few important events that take place in the story. \
The art for Naruto is average and inconstant at times. The art style will just randomly change between some important episodes. It tends to change right before an important fight. It's annoying to have it suddenly change for a few episodes, then goes right back to the normal art style.    \
The biggest problem for this show comes is the Mary Sue elements they throw in there. Mary Sue is a term for a character that is perfect in every way and solves everything problem with some stupid new ability that he//she just suddenly obtains. The best example of this is Neo from the Matrix. None of Naruto's characters are perfect, they all have clear flaws that are easily noticeable. But it's that second part of a Mary Sue that Naruto falls victim to. \
Sasuke Uchiha is almost a complete Mary Sue. If it wasn't for him being a complete jerk to everyone, he would be 100% Mary Sue. Everyone loves Sasuke. They all think he is awesome and show loves to remind you that fact over and over again. Despite his awful attitude and the fact that he literally cares about no one, he is loved and cherished by all. Almost all the girls at one point think about how cute Sasuke is. He is the equivalent of Kirito from SAO. Except you are forced to deal with Sasuke for over 100 episodes. \
The biggest problem with Sasuke is his special ability, Sharingan. The Sharingan allows Sasuke to predict his opponents moves and copy them. It's really cool at first, till you realize how stupid it is. The Sharingan also has a hypnotic ability that is stupid powerful. At this point Sasuke's Sharingan is in the weaker stages, but it still lets him when many fights he should easily lose. At one point they make you think Sasuke won't win every single fight with Sharingan, and while he does lose a few fights, the Sharangin allows him to win many fights he should lose. The Sharingan also randomly powers up when it needs to. When Sasuke can't see his opponents movements, boom, Sharingan upgrades. If it wasn't for Sharingan, Sasuke would be easier to deal with.\
Naruto himself also falls victim to the random bursts of power that Mary Sues have. But with Naruto it is much easier to deal with because his power up, being the Chakra of the nine-tailed beast, only powers him up when needed. He isn't constantly using the nine-tailed beast chakra, he only uses a little bit of it in his fights. Some fights he doesn't use it at all. And unlike Sasuke who is just naturally good with Sharingan, it takes Naruot a lot of time to learn the basics of controlling the beasts chakra. And even with this massive power boast he still loses some fights with it. It doesn't feel overpowered because Naruto isn't using it constantly, he only uses its full power against incredibly powerful opponents. \
Now to talk about my favorite thing in Naruto, the fights. Naruto's fights feel so impressive because of justu. Justu is basically the equivalent to ki attacks in DBZ. There is limitless possibilities with justu. Each character has a special move or move type. Naruto has shadow clone justu, Sasuke has Chodori, Shikamaru has shadow possession justu, etc. Their move pool is limited to only 1 or 2 justus (unless you are Sasuke, he has 4 justu) so seeing them have to think of special strategy to win their fights. Shikamaru's fights, in particular, are very impressive. The show establishes the fact that he is a genies and use it fully. He comes up with incredible strategies to win his fights, yet he always stays true to his lazy nature. \
It's actually funny, cause Naruto's fights are actually pretty boring. Until the fourth story arc, the only real combat move he knows is shadow clone justu. So most of his fights just become a punching match. And as much as I hate Sasuke, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy his fights a lot. But, the most impressive fighter has to be Rock Lee. He can't use justu of any kind. So instead he uses taijustu, which is hand to hand combat. He is at a massive disadvantage in every single fight, yet he still does an amazing job. Even if he doesn't win every fight, he always wears his opponent down. \
There are so many good things about Naruto, the fights, the decent plot, Naruto's character development,  the side characters. But the flaws in the show are big, a lack of strong female characters and Sasuke's whole entire character.\
Just Sasuke's presence ruins multiple scenes. Characters like Sasuke are bland characters with so much wasted potential. When the show tries to get you to care and feel bad about Sasuke it fails. Because we know who Sasuke is, it doesn't matter how sad his past is when we can't relate to him in the present. We can't like him in the present because he isn't a good person at all. He was only a good person as a child, if the show started with that and then we saw the transformation of him becoming a jerk in the beginning of the series, then maybe we could care about him. But, he starts the show off as a jerk and ends the show off as an even bigger jerk than he was before. \
Despite my problems with Sasuke and the female characters, I would sill recommend Naruto to anyone. It is a good show, with many great qualities. The show struggles in regard to girls and Sasuke, but besides that, I found myself enjoying almost every single moment of Naruto. Naruto gets a \

    Just skip the fillers and you'll most likely watch the best shonen out there. I finished the complete Naruto series within 2 months. Without the fillers you still need to watch around 400 episodes but you'll never get bored even once. It's a true masterpiece.\
The soundtrack alone is just perfect, it fits every scene perfectly! Furthermore you get a perfect japanese dubbing, each voice is unique and acted out superbad. The story is one of the most meaningful ever created.\
Overall as I stated before it really is a masterpiece. Of course it has flaws but overall you'll get to see some of the best villains\

        ever created (all of them carry a superior motivation, noone is just plain evil), the twists are really breathtaking and you get great character development as well (even the smallest siderole gets the time it deserves to fill that person with life).\
You won't regret it, I promise. It's due to the fillers that a lot of people dropped it so you are lucky now being able to circumvent them and to enjoy the canon story to it's whole extent.\

     Naruto is easily in first place in my top 10 worst/i hate animes of all times, i have never seen a anime this overrated before, the only other being gurren lagann, this series started more than an decade and there are still those fools who think it's an epic story, and unfortunately raised what is now one of the worst fanbases of all animes alongside one piece and  dragon ball, it didn't make part of my childhood lucky for me because for a lot of people it did, and unfortunately i don't even like talking about anime with those it did because i\
          \
        can see they don't much about anime to begin with\
There are many reasons why this is the anime series i hate the most, this is an list of someone who tried more than once to like this godforsaken story, but unfortunately in the end it served of nothing, the only redeemable valor is the soundtrack and a few fights, and that's it, and that cannot hold an series.\
That aside let's start this rather long list\
1.Main characters, the characters in naruto are the very definition of cliche, especially Sasuke, the guy is screams cliche every time a word come out of his mouth, characters in naruto are really badly developed, aside naruto and  and maybe shikamaru, gaara, hinata and itachi, all others are mostly throw in the thrash can without a decent development or even a decent fight, also, my god sakura and ino motivation, is that what they want? date an prick who treats everyone like shit and think is dark and badass?'''oh i want to kill my brother'' that's arguably one of the worst motivations in an anime, and people say Sakura and Ino are good characters, not even in hell they are, they were always terrible, no wonder as the series went on hinata started to become more and more popular, because the girl always had an objective despite liking naruto, these two became so notorious even the most die hard fans of naruto often hate especially sakura who is useless, people are tired of this princess stereotype of female characters that can't do jack shit and that's why often you see people who prefer the villains over the main characters(this includes myself).\
2.Villains, the villains on the counterpart, are actually more interesting than the main characters, especially Zabuza, Haku, Orochimaru, Kimimaro, Itachi, Kisame, Kakuzu and hidan(the best duo)etc however they are just like a lot of the main characters thrown in the thrash, they have great potential but are poorly used and are defeated by some of the most outrageous plot armor in an anime ever, especially Kimimaro, which had big potential, this same feat will repeat in shippuden with characters like, sasori, deidara, kakuzu and hidan(my two favorites), the entire akatsuki, they could have been the main characters not the villains easily since they are leagues more interesting than the main characters, hell imagine how cool would it be if konan was the main ''heroine'' instead of generic and boring character that sakura is?\
3. World/Lore, the world in naruto was never well explored or well used, there are other villages but in the end is all about konoha, clichemoto tries to make the series have an deeper world and lore and etc, but he fails every time because he doesn't know what to do with it, the characters only mention other places and villages, but its never shown, and to tell the truth the other villages from what is commented are a lot more interesting, but mostly pointless, the only interesting thing on its lore is the bijuu like kurama/kyuubi and shukaku and a few others that appear on shippuden, and that's it, it doesn't explore beyond that, and even that he finds and way to screw it up by making bijuus except kyuubi useless for the most part except awaking the 10 tails.\
4.Bad logics and plot armor, ever since naruto started, it was clear clichemoto doesn't know how to make character power levels, because it makes no fucking sense, and kid who trained idk for like only months be able to beat and war veteran and born to battle enemies who knows a lot more about fighting and still loses, this is ridiculous, this is an example of bad logic and use of plot armor, and this happens from starts to finish and it manages to become worse in naruto shippuden where the restrictions are thrown in the garbage and everyone starts to become chakra gods.\
5.The animation, well the naruto animation always had an bad legacy, it has a lot of flaws and just plain errors that can be noticed if you pause while watching, some even say not to pause naruto while watching if you want to avoid it, the worst part, is because there are other animes from pierrot like bleach, and bleach has nowhere near the same problem naruto had, which makes you question why the fuck it's animations are bad for the most part and feel cheap, there are other animes from that same decade that don't look as cheap as naruto, and don't think the manga is way better because clichemoto is not that good in drawing, occasionally rising above average but not that much\
6.Soundtrack, the soundtrack in the series is perhaps one of the few solid points of it, it has soundtracks that unfortunately marked an generation, but aren't necessarily good nor bad, it only served more to please the naruto fanboys so they can keep living in their forever nostalgia, sure there good soundtracks, but i would say there are better ones out there, hell bleach has an even better soundtrack, shiro sagisou did an better job in bleach compared to naruto soundtrack, also the openings, well the only one i consider good is the last opening, which is not an j-rock opening we have seen a million times, it also demonstrates martial arts better than the anime, and unfortunately almost all of the other openings are j-rocks that are nostalgia driven, and aren't really that good, also fuck you asian kung fu generation for making one of the most overrated openings in the planet that relies on nostalgia, also known as haruka kanata\
7. Fillers, naruto is already notorious along with bleach and even one piece for it's fillers, it's one of the reasons a lot of people(like me) hate the series, the fillers really made the quantity of episodes bigger than it should, naruto shippuden ended with 500 episodes thanks to it's god forsaken fillers, and classic naruto is no different, the series were stretched out thanks to them, and that's not a good thing, plainly made for greedy reasons to keep the money flowing and also give time for clichemoto to create more cliche chapters.\
8. Story, the story in naruto can be noticed to be very scripted and filled with some of the most boring cliches ever, this is why when the fourth ninja war happened and it went downhill and consequently screwed naruto reputation(for me a good thing, finally people woke the fuck up that it has never been this amazing story to begin with), because the story revolves on the same classic idea of good x evil, sometimes trying to blur the lines of good and evil along with a bit of philosophy, but it doesn't hold up it's cliches nor it saves, it just makes you crave when something new happens, only to be filled with cliches again and again as if they were new and ''good'', and people use naruto story as an compare meter to other animes, which is pathetic, this story has never been that good to begin with, starts slow and weak, gains a bit of strength, goes downhill, it's not like bleach and one piece, were bleach starts really strong, one of the best shounens starts ever and then loses a bit of steam but manages to get back, or one piece where it starts really weak but then BOOM especially in the alabasta and marine ford arc, also this is another problem, there is no marine ford arc level on naruto, which just shows how clichemoto doesn't know what to do sometimes\
This is perhaps naruto biggest flaw, some of you will agree others might just  some insane logic to try justify it, but it's still an flaw, and it never got better in the series, especially in the fillers, and it's one of the reasons i hate naruto because it shits on this pre-idealized idea for some generic designs and the final and biggest flaw is..\
9.The characters don't fucking LOOK LIKE NINJAS TO BEGIN WITH, This is pretty much an flaw of naruto that breaks immersion and makes you see the characters as anything else like monks, mages etc anything but ninjas, clichemoto character designs for the most part sucks, and it shits on the idea of ninjas, you know stealth oriented warriors that are completely in black, and are deadly and kill without hesitation, which is something 90% of the characters lack, the only two characters in this entire fucking series that look like an ninja and act like an ninja or close to it, is Kakuzu and Haku, BOTH WERE SO BADLY USED AND DEFEATED BY PLOT ARMOR THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS, WHY THE ONLY FUCKING 2 CHARACTERS THAT LOOK LIKE NINJA IN THE SERIES, WERE THROWN IN THE GARBAGE, WHILE CHARACTERS LIKE NARUTO HIMSELF,KIBA, INO, SAKURA, SASUKE, CHOUJI, TENTEN, ROCK LEE, KANKURU, TEMARI,KONOHAMARU AND HIS FRIENDS, SHIKAMARU, GAARA ETC DON'T LOOK LIKE NINJAS ARE STILL IN THE SERIES, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, NO STUPID THEORY OR JACK SHIT WILL JUSTIFY THIS, NARUTO IS THE WORST THING TO HAVE EVER HAPPEN TO CONCEPT OF NINJAS  AND IT ALSO MANAGED TO DETURPATE IT, WHY THE FUCK PEOPLE TURN AN BLIND EYE TO IT? ''oh but is clichemoto interpretation of ninjas'' NO ONE ASKED FOR HIS INTERPRETATION OF NINJAS, THE GUY NEVER HAD AN CLUE OF WHAT AN NINJA LOOKS LIKE FROM IT'S HINTED ON HIS CHARACTERS DESIGNS AND HE SUCKS, IF YOU COMPARE TO D-GRAY MAN CHARACTER DESIGNS, NARUTO IS ANEMIC ON THAT ASPECT.\
And perhaps this is it, all the reasons why this series sucks and is overrated, it's an series that has finally fucking finished,(at least until boruto shows up ZzZzZz) being stretched up to 500 episodes thanks to its fillers, and perhaps something better will come to take it's place, from which i deeply hope, this series is an testament of how people let their nostalgia a lot of time speak bigger and ignore flaws, flaws from which made naruto lose a lot of popularity especially in the future fourth ninja war, like i said i tried more than once to like it, but i's like banging my head against the wall for something not worthwhile, i hope clichemoto(yes i call him this way after my friend called him that) at least learn something from all of his mistakes, and please god stay away from any other ethnic group and don't try to deturpate it, this review is huge but i wanted to stay clear all the reasons, not just some empty hater who just hates it because it's popular, no i hate it because it was never that great to begin with, only have popularity, thank you and have a nice day watching better animes.\

    Naruto is one of those animes that is really well known has a huge following. \
I've attempted to watch it for years but failed in a couple attempts. But thanks to netflix i have finally been able to watch the entire series. Well minus the filler i skipped those episodes. \
The show starts out and i hated the lead character he was loud and annoying and seemed to repeat the same lines a ridiculous amount. As the show went i would say i had passing interest until around the episode 50 mark in the series. \
The characters seemed to really start to develop around this\
          \
        point. In the chuein exam arc in particular. Naruto himself gradually became less annoying. Sakura slowly faded to the background before disapearing almost completly. \
I found that supporting cast was actually moe likeable then the main cast. Kikashi was two scoops of awesome but their would be long spans of time he would completly disappear from the show. this would happen with pretty much everyone except Naruto. \
One problem was that some fights would drag on way too long. One in particular that featured a character death took so long that the impact of this characters death was completly lost. This was something id call dbz syndrome where a character over explains their moves. \
Another thing that came up alot is that it seemed during every battle a character would say \"i have used up all of my chakra\" or something around those lines it got to a ridiculous point that i joked about it with a friend. \
I think what holds this series back is the fact that it drags things out too much. In the same way dragonball z did. The fights that are the most enjoyable are the more all out action fights. There were fights that did last multiple episodes that were fantastic like the last \"main\" fight of the series that the animators seemed to bring beyond their a game and during that series of episodes itself i would give a ten for the arc as things just looked beautiful. \
The story had some great moments and if some things werent dragged out like i think that if the show were cut it half we probably wouldnt lose alot. \
\
All in all i would recommend this show it may not live up to the hype some people give it but it does have its moments it is worth a viewing if you have the time i would suggest finding a filler list to skip filler episodes though. \

    In one paragraph, here's a review from someone who watched Naruto as a newbie but is now a relatively experienced anime fan:\
Naruto is the first anime that I ever watched. Sure - it's not like any of the current mainstream anime (under 30 episodes). It doesn't have the intellectual intensity, dynamic story line, quick and intense character development, and other factors are common in all great anime today. It's quite long at some times, there are some annoying fillers, and its been going on for over 15 years. But, at least for me, that is what makes it great! See, spending time on this show,\
          \
        watching the characters actually grow as time passes, enjoying the strong moments and sobering through the sad ones is what makes this show appealing to so many young people across the world. Naruto has all the elements of an anime meant to show the beauty of life - not to delve into an intellectual or emotional rollercoaster. I might even say that some of the important decisions that I have made in life may have been inspired by this show. \
Undoubtedly, I will continue to watch Naruto, Boruto, or whatever comes despite how good or useless it is - think of this as a testament to what this show means to me and so many others. \

    Started with potential, then should have been renamed Sasuke thus the story is pathetic. the art was good, though I watched it really long ago. The sound of the American Naruto's voice makes my ears bleed, though I assume they're referring to the sound effects. The characters are weird, and not the good weird. When art and sound are the highest ratings, you know it's bad. There is a reason I dropped this.

    I may be biased here but hey, Naruto is the one who brought me to anime world (well it's Sasuke actually) without Naruto I'd still be blind about anime world. Naruto is the only one anime that I gave 10 because ofc:\
1. I'm biased.\
2. There's sasuke.\
3. Sasusaku is one of the top OTP.\
4. the character drawings, the background stories, everything is great. IDK what to say anymore about that.\
5. teach us many lessons (and great quotes as well)\
6. great music.\
7. many twists and many more things that I can't mention but it's really worth to watch!\

    If you're reading this, you may have heard of the title \"Big Three\" given to those three long-running shounen anime, two of which are still airing, that have most enraptured and inspired young males around the world in the modern era -- Bleach, Naruto, and One Piece. Don't be intimidated by these shows' lengths; I was too at first, but after starting them I didn't want to stop. It may be a long journey, but all the more to relish and savor that moment when you finally finish, when you can sit back and think back to when it all began and how much stronger\
          \
        the characters have become and comparing the beginning and the end; that is what I look forward to when watching such an anime.\
Before I begin, I'll get to the bad things. Being such a long anime, and being based off manga that is the work of one man, it's only natural to have filler. If the anime's got to the point where they can't release more episodes based on the manga (the mangaka's only got so much time and energy, after all), they have to make some filler to \"fill\" in the gaps between canon content. Now, I can understand the feelings of fans who watched Naruto back when it aired and had to wait so long between episodes 135 and 220 (136-219 being filler) week after week; but this review applies when those fans can watch anime not on the TV screen, easily skip such filler, and watch just the original storyline.\
Second, there's always criticism of the lackluster animation. Look, Studio Pierrot doesn't have the time or the money to dedicate itself to produce the same scintillating quality as seen in most 1- or 2-cour anime. Take Tokyo Ghoul, for instance, done by the same studio but having some of the best visuals and lighting effects I've ever seen in any anime -- that was only 24 episodes for both seasons total. Given this fact, Naruto still does pretty well, and the animation's not the #1 thing to look for in an anime.\
Third, the heavy presence of fighting. These characters are like all ninjas, who by definition spend their lives training and fighting, so such an aspect is only natural.\
Now... where do I begin?\
Like One Piece with its protagonist, Naruto's has a dream that drives him to keep going and ultimately inspires others also -- to become Hokage, the head ninja of his village, and finally gain the recognition that he could never have as a child. Like the lead characters of several popular shounen anime, Naruto Uzumaki is kinda stupid and silly but when he's down, he always gets back up. Watching his growth from episode 1 to episode 220 was quite the experience -- and I'm not done yet, I'm now watching Naruto: Shippuuden and the story's still going strong as ever but even better. I'm telling you, it's worth it, tackling a long show such as this. There are deep plot threads waiting to be unraveled, really powerful characters to meet, dreams to be achieved. (Naruto lays down the foundation for the overarching plot of the story and details the characters, whereas Naruto: Shippuuden takes on the main conflict.)\
What Naruto does particularly well is developing its characters. Unlike One Piece, which focuses more on worldbuilding and plot development, Naruto emphasizes the personalities, backstories, and unique strengths and weaknesses of its primary characters. The three main ones, Naruto and Sakura and Sasuke especially; but besides them, there are their fellow ninjas and friends, and taking it all in together including the bad guys' stories it's a fine thing. The more you watch them interact with each other, the more real and individually human they feel. Since ninjas carry out missions in four-man teams, each team has its own chemistry, which is always nice to see. Masashi Kishimoto excels in illustrating the growth of each of his respective main characters; several times during the series I teared up after a flashback and/or reminiscing upon how much they’ve grown.\
As I said before, anime studios can’t by their very nature do a superb job with the animation. So don’t be surprised when you encounter repeated shots during fight scenes. However, in contrast with Pierrot’s other main work Bleach, the fights are more fluid and thus more enjoyable to watch. These are ninjas, after all, so they do a lot of hand-to-hand combat. Many youths have probably played ninja inspired by Naruto over the years. The artwork is often underlain by a soft, almost sepia-like tone, which lends itself to the mood during important fight scenes.\
Speaking of fighting, Kishimoto concludes most of them quite intelligently -- that is, often ninjas employ deception and multiple layers to their moves during combat, so usually they don’t end up the way you would expect. Like for reiatsu in Bleach and Devil Fruits in One Piece, ninjas fight using chakra from their bodies in various ways, from summoning animals to manipulating the elements to walking upside down on tree branches. Thus there is a myriad number of unique fighting styles beyond the simple kick and punch and kunai knife. The one drawback is that some fights last through several episodes, but watching Naruto today that can be overcome easily by watching the episodes back to back.\
I wasn’t too stimulated by the soundtrack. Hearing the tribal-esque war shouts over and over again irked me a bit. That being said, the music is mostly comprised of percussion, emphasis of wind instruments (e.g. flute), and a fast-paced rhythm. It does suit the ninja environment, however.\
In terms of enjoyment, I watched Naruto sporadically until around episode 55, at which point things got going and I watched mostly just Naruto until I finished the series. The main thing that encouraged me to keep watching was the quality of the fights, which in my opinion surpasses those in Bleach (for the most part). Then again, don’t expect an anime in the hundreds of episodes to enthrall you for the entire time. It’s worth it, though, to watch it through, to see how much these guys grow.\
It is human nature to desire love, and recognition. This is the tale of a young man on a journey of friendship, loyalty, becoming stronger, and ultimately showing the shinobi world his own Way of Ninja.\

    Naruto has some of the most interesting supporting characters you'll see in an anime, and there are a lot of them.  The main character and story line on the other hand are nothing special; both being frequently annoying and incredibly redundant.  I'm not same the the anime is bad.  I could be quite enjoyable if you like that sort of thing.  But its nothing new and there are really no elements to set it apart.  It is average at best and doesn't deserve the hype it gets.\

    First time i watched Naruto i did not like it. Second time i did not like it but since all the people praised it for being so good i saw 5 episodes of it. Before that i didnt even got through the 1. And i liked it. \
The story takes place in an alternitive world where ninjas exist. And you will be following Naruto and his life as an ninja. He is an 12 year old kid who graduates from the ninja acadmey at the first episode and so his the journey begins with Uchiha Sasuke and Sakura Haruno as Team 7.\
If you like the\
          \
        system, world etc you will love this serie, even if youre not a fan of the main charachter. \
The best thing about Naruto is the story and charachters. You will feel sympathy for almost everyone and at some point you might even cry.\
The music is also a great thing. Toshiro Masuda who composed the soundtrack is godlike. You will be listening to the soundtrack the rest of your life after this.\
The first 135 episodes are godlike. Even tho they did censored some things its still awsome but after that the rest is just fillers. \
Then there is Shippuuden, Its a continue of Naruto when is older but they thought of Naruto as a way to make money so the Anime went down a bit.\
But the Shippuuden manga is even better then the first 135 episodes.\

    this is my first review so i thought i start it with the first anime (besides pokemon) that i have watch Naruto. i used to love naruto when i was young being hook on to every episode, waiting eagerly for the next one to come out. it was a good anime and i think it a great anime to first start watch anime. now that my options is out lets start the review.\
story- The story is about a boy named Naruto who has a nine tail fox seal in him has set out to become the Hokage of the leaf village. i kind of like\
          \
        the story because it was so simply even a 6 year-old child would have figure it out in the first episode.(this it true ask my cousin if u don't believe). the story was great until it got to sakuke turning evil, after that it was just crappy fillers. i personally didn't like filler because it get us off track of the real story that is happening. i think i end it here.\
art- The art in this anime was nothing to be excited about. there is nothing special about it. it will not make you jump out your seat or bed surprised. its just decent. i also think that the artist was either lazy when he did some episodes or he was messing with us.like that time during the Chunin exams when sasuke's forehead was huge. i think he was trying to make us laugh and it worked cause i was lmao.\
sound- Sounds were great and incredible. the voice actor done a great job with this anime and music were pretty awesome. most of the OP and ED were great and i actually listen to it enjoyment without skip it. and my favorite of all was the backgrounds music play during every sad moment made me almost cry.(almost)\
characters- the character in Naruto are good but the problem is that the character development sucks. naruto is still the cocky and stupid kid who trys his best, sakura is still a useless and bitchy girl who still in love with sasuke. finally sasuke who i think did a little development from emo to Super Emo.\
enjoyment- Naruto is very good anime to begin first watchig anime. naruto has that addiction that make you want to see the next episode a soon as possible. the fighting scene were the most enjoyable to watch. and even though it had alot of crappy filler i did find a couple that were good.\
overall this is a good anime with some of the best music i ever heard and i'm saying this because it was the only thing i thought was really good. you should started watching this if you haven't because this anime waits for no one\

    IT IS POPULAR FOR A REASON!\
I just re-watched this show two months ago, so I'd thought I should review it.\
When I first watched it years ago, I remember gradually falling in love with it. Asides from Yu Yu Hakusho, this was the second anime that grabbed my attention. I really did not like it at first. I thought it was boring, sexy/harem- jutsu annoyed me, and Haku's gender confused me! I think what grabbed me to this show was Zabuza's final speech. That whole scene was brilliantly emotional, and I automatically became hooked.\
That being said, it takes a while to fall in love with this\
          \
        show (it starts off really good though), and then it takes another while to fall out of love with it. But do I recommend this anime? Yes, that is considering you have the time to watch, you are patient, and realize that there is another series (Part II) after this. The show does not really end.\
The soundtrack for this anime is amazing!  In my opinion it's unique, not classical,  and better than what you expect! That's all I can say about it.\
The art gets better as the story progresses especially the fighting sequence. Unfortunately, I cannot say this about Shippuden (Naruto: Part II).\
As for the characters, after you watch a lot of anime, you realize how unoriginal they are. There is nothing special about them. However, when I first watched it, I remember having a very difficult  time deciding who my favorite character was going to be because I thought all of them were amazing. Now, I cannot stand most of the characters.\
Naruto: the main character is alright. His perseverance is very admirable. The only problem I have with him is that he is dull-witted; but even that is a gateway to bring humor into the show. I’m glad he is the hero of this series because he does bring the good emotional side of everyone.\
Sasuke: He is the reason why I hate characters that are so emotional. That \"cool-dark\" vibe does not appeal to me. It is over used! He is the definition of a psychotic masochistic-emotional loser! I just want to slap him. It gets worse as the episode goes on. I did even not understand how all the girls love him. Speaking of the girls, how come they are all ridiculously vacuous? \
Saukura: If she is the smartest out of her classmate, there is something really wrong with the people there. All she does is love Sasuke. She is mean to everyone else. Furthermore, there are moments that she does have character development, BUT right afterward she is just annoying again: A FAIL of a heroine.\
Haku- he is not a main character, but I remember having an argument with my family about whether he was girl or a boy. It really did start a riot in my house. It was a mind boggling moment in my life. I swear! This was before I realized that Japanese anime always has at least one male character that speaks and looks like a girl. However, it is still surprising that the English dub kept the female voice. \
As for the other characters such as: Neji, Hinata, Kakashi, Gaara, Lee, Choji, (and so many more!)are developed really nicely. I love them! All of them have similar traits to Naruto, but they are different and beautiful\
Lastly, I want to speak about Shikamaru! The laziest character of ‘em all.  To be honest, I had never seen a character like him before when I started watching, so he fascinated me (now I know, there are so many of them). I feel like out of all the characters, he had the best character development even though he was not a part of all the episodes. It was done perfectly as well. The laziness still lived on, but the maturity starts revealing itself. He is what you call intelligent, not Sakura\
Lets just say, as  cliche as the characters are, their (heartbreaking) storyline makes the show.\
What do I hate about Naruto?\
It doesn't end. There are so many fillers (pointless episodes that do not relate to the storyline). A person can only watch so much! I must have been really stupid, because when I started this show, I LOVED the filler. However, it took so much out of me that I could not even watch Shippuden. \
If you are going to watch the show, do not watch the fillers! DO NOT WATCH IT!\
The only fillers that you should watch are the ones that you like. Research the episodes before you begin. I loved episode 101: Kakashi's real face. It was a question I was thinking about since the beginning of the anime, so it was interesting to know that the characters thought about it too! And the Neji's curry episode was funny as well.\
If you are a Hinata, Neji, Sjhikamura, Kiba, Ino, (or whoever), there are specific episodes related to them, so just watch those only, nothing more. There are more than 100 fillers I believe, soo..... don't. watch. all of them.\
Overall, this is only a review for Part I.. believe me, if I had to talk about the manga or Shippuden, the rage would ooze out of your computer screen. Okay, not really, but I would have more negative things to say even though I like it.",

    I would say that the first season is really really good. After the first season the series takes a turn and starts to get worse, i wish they would have kept it a shorter season. I really don't know how anyone can watch a 220 episode season and still enjoy it lol. Thats the problem i see with naruto, it just gets boring after awhile, unless your a super fan. I would say watch the first two seasons they are both good, then after that there is so much filler and just crap it's not even worth it. Let alone naruto shipudden its way worse\

    This anime is about a ninja boy who dreams to be Hokage so the village will acknowledged him. He has a biju in him which is the Kyubi. He gets joined in a team with his crush Sakura and his rival Sasuke and his sensei Kakashi. This leads to meeting villains doing tourments like Chinnin Exams. The animations are good like the water, the character design. Everytime i hear a ost from here i get joy for the scene. Some characters are interesting like Orochimaru or Kakashi.

    This review goes for both Naruto and Naruto Shippudden.....and all the 10 movies and 6-7 specials as well as the spin-offs. [no spoilers]\
I've been through so many reviews saying naruto is an over-rated anime....\
And they are not wrong. Perhaps naruto may be a little over-rated. Some say the story keeps collapsing, others complain about the animation, things don't make sense even to the supernatural and fantasy genre, flashbacks can be lengthy (it's more than in the manga), the number of fillers (I side them on this) are more than there should be.....so maybe Naruto is over-rated.....but why?\
I know how they feel. I keep wondering what\
          \
        was it that made people score Clannad, Spirited Away to the top 15 list (pardon for those who liked it).\
Just like they speak so of these animes so compellingly, I shall speak a little so of this one:\
There is something about the Naruto series that makes us just love it. Maybe it's the story which so cliched or unpredictably entertaining which doesn't want to make you miss a single episode, or the characters which are so much varied and contrasting making you laugh yourself out. Maybe it's the action which can make one thrilled and surprised at times, or the length of the series which you keep watching and eventually start to like it alot, like a normal song. Maybe it is the songs! People love it for some reason or maybe all of it. It just makes us feel so lovable towards it.\
And it's not a first.\
I've noticed there exist this category of animes that are usually action-based, supernatural, fantasy related with episode numbers exceeding hundreds and dozens of sequels and side-stories and a classic - Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, Bleach, Katekyo Hitman Reborn!, etc. etc., and of course, Naruto.\
All of them may have so many minor or major flaws in them and may not make it to the top 15 or 50 list....but they are the ones which stays in our memories longer, no matter what your type of genre and likings are. Which while caught during flipping through channels many years later we wouldn't mind watching it for some time, no matter how senseless it feels then, which would make you say \"Aaaah the good ol' days, I loved this anime.\"\
Perhaps it's why they have so many more fans all over the world than haters and have their characters on every anime site you go too [and (sadly or not for some) have hentais made over them too ): ]\
I watch them and sometimes even I notice the flaws in them and wonder \"maybe it is over-rated (fans are gonna kill me), but what the hell.\" and I continue.\
It's not worthy or un-worthy of your time. It's just plain enjoyable, thats all  : )\

    I'm going to keep this short as I can. This is a great show and has the potential to be one of the best anime series possibly of all time, but an incredibly irritating main character who you also love, a very stereo typical rivalry, an incredibly stereotypical love triangle, a ratio of 1 to 500, 1 being action, 1000 being dialogue and memory flashbacks, some sloppy art (forgivable with the amount of episodes but considering how sometimes it looks like a child drew it, it's inexcusable to me).\
Also it has that goku vs freezer on namek issue where what should have LITERALLY been a\
          \
        5 minute battle is stretched over about 10 or 15 20 minute episodes.\
Take away all this and you have an amazing anime, but unfortunately, I do not recommend you watch this unless you have an incredible amount of patience and a high tolerance or like even, for annoying characters who do a running commentary on what they are doing, what they are going to do, and all that stuff every 5 minutes. It's great if you have a bad memory because you will always be reminded of what's going every 5 minutes of every episodes.\
I wouldn't say it deserves the hype that it had and still has now but the story is good, especially if you manage to bare with it until it gets to shippuden where it gets much less annoying and the story gets REALLY interesting.\

    Wow. I've been following the fandom and hype of this series for about four years now and i haven't managed to think up a review that encompasses the brilliance of Naruto. It's a staple in shounen jump and arguably one of the best animes of all time. All i can say, while avoiding spoilers, is that its a phenomenal series that everyone HAS to check out. If you're new to anime, then its also a great series to start off with. You may not love it immediately but 10 episodes in and you'll be hooked, i promise you that.\
It's my favourite anime for so many\
          \
        reasons. It just evokes so many feelings in you. You start caring about the characters so much and becoming so absorbed in the plot without even noticing it yourself. The world building is also so believable that it just makes you want to live it, despite the many sacrifices of being a ninja. Every character and every arc teaches you something new, if you only just stop to ponder.\
The plot is insane. If you haven't read the synopsis, its about about a boy who hosts a demon fox spirit which is shunned by the entire village but is still determined to become hokage(the village leader).  Naruto is probably the only series i have watched where every arc is captivating and keeps you on the edge of the seats. The battle sequences are also nicely chereographed and well-thought out.  The plot is carefully woven and well-paced so there are no giant gaps between arcs. The so-called ''filler'' episodes are as funny and entertaining as the actual episodes and also contribute to the plot, rather than filling up screentime with mindless laughs, like other animes do.\
My favourite thing about the series are the characters and their development. Despite having a huge cast, each character is still given his or her moment to shine and no one is left out. Naruto is a great protagonist. He's spirited and stubborn in the best way, refusing to give up on his goals no matter what the setbacks. Sasuke, sakura and kakashi are also well-characterised. Kakashi, in particular, was a character that i found interesting because of his aloofness and mysterious past. That's the best thing about the series. The characters are all so unique. You won't be able to find duplicates of anyone in naruto. Side characters also fit nicely with the plot and are interesting to watch. Another thing i like about the series is how the villains are treated. They are also given screen time to show their development and are not just mindless and one-dimensional. It's not just the good guys getting all the attention.\
The artwork was beautifully done and was a great conversion from the manga. As for the voices, i prefer the english dubbed over subbed. I felt that unlike other animes, naruto's doubbed voice actors were casted brilliantly and even surpassed the japanese seiyuus, because their voices suited the characters better. They also didn't sound forced and contrived, like other series do, which was a plus.\
Overall, i rate naruto an outstanding 10 because its the best anime i've seen to date and it will probably claim that number one spot for a really long time. Go watch it, if you haven't already. Check out the manga version too. You won't regret it. \

    to those how are new to anime and have watched this are your first i wish to be the first to offer a apology for this will most likely turn you off the anime world\
story: because this is a shonen jump anime/manga there is barely a story with most of it being filler this wouldn't be a problem if it was a random story anime like hetalia but seeing as it was meant to be a continuing story you will get turned off by the over use of switching story's and the over long episodes.\
art: many might be turned on by the art style and\
          \
        the look of the character however the animation will be a turn off when you realise that some of it were exact copys from other better done animes like this infamous one http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e86/CETAWS6/1256431478681.gif\
sounds: the sound was not as annoying but it is very forgettable \
character: it's impossible for me to do this part with out using the words hate of f@#$ you anywhere. naruto is the main character but he's pretty much everything bad about anime rolled into one. he's annoying, he a complete douchebag, he's a loud mouth, and were suppose to like him. he's not the only annoying one in the show. sasuke is basicly the agnst type without any of the growing up. sakura is a annoying fan girl to the agnst so half her dialouge is \"oh sasuke, oh sasuke\" to be honest it's hard to say anything good about the character (with the exception of kakashi because he act's like a ninja. the perverted sage for being a perverted and the shy girl because she rarely talks). in other words i hate these characters\
enjoyment: what enjoyment the anime is too fast paced and gives no room for anyone to breath in the show but there is nothing to breath in that's worth breathing\
overall: AVOID THIS ANIME AT ALL COST. if your new to anime avoid it like the plaque this can most likely ruin anime for you! watch other anime's doesn't matter what just anything besides this!!\

    I suppose why Naruto is so popular and can be welcomed for ages, the main reason is Naruto just like a funny booktext, every one reads it with fun and remembers the context and charaters. when we grow up the idea of be one of the character in Naruto just come out. and Naruto is still there.\

    Alright first review I've ever done, so I'm going to tackle a show near and dear to my heart.\
Naruto\
For many anime fans this was the gateway anime that entered them into this culture. It was flashy, fun, and definitely appealed to a great many with it's over the top action.\
Looking back however, it doesn't have the gleam as it once did.\
Story: 6\
The story has a simple premise in common with many shonen, group of kids with special powers go and defeat the bad guys and save the world or town. Then more bad guys are introduced and true motives are revealed and it starts to\
          \
        become a jumbled mess. In first 6 seasons of the show( minus any filler), the story was clean, simple, and engaging to an extent; come the start of the filler seasons, the story begins to needlessly complicate then come shippuden everything falls apart into a jumbled mess full of plot holes.\
Art: 6\
The art in Naruto is vibrant (though a little flat at points) and makes good use of color palette and the various villages have pretty interesting designs. The animation though is solid at best and downright pitiful at worst .Shippuden improves on this factor. (Sometimes)\
Sound:9\
Now this in my opinion is what made Naruto stand out among the other \"Big Three\" The opening and closing themes are almost always catchy and the background music has a distinctly Japanese feel that always complements the mood. \
Character: 6\
Now here is definitely the most controversial aspect of Naruto.\
Lets start with the main Three\
Naruto: He's your typical loudmouth, hyperactive shonen protagonist. Though he does go from being bratty to a more typical hero, there's virtually nothing about him that stands out from other characters, except maybe his fashion sense.\
Sasuke: He's the token cool mysterious black-haired character who is rivals with the protagonist. He's not really interesting and his turn to darkness is seen from a mile away. He just gets worse throughout the series. There's really not much to say about his character, he exists to serve as character development and plot. ( And fangirl-bait)\
Sakura: She's the absolute worst of the bunch. This character mearly serves the role of being the \"girl\" on the team and having a crush on the cool kid. Even though she did well on the ninja exams, she shows absolutely zero capability in combat and sits on the sidelines waiting for one of the male leads to rescue her.  She has no real character traits other than \"Tsundere\" until season 5 where she becomes aware of her own uselessness. I blame the author for her lack of character, most of his female characters are atrociously written. That being said, she does develop a personality and becomes extremely useful in Shippuden and actually becomes likable.\
For the other characters it's hit or miss, some bring something new to the character archtypes, though most are flat though with little depth. That being said, there is substantial character development with almost all of the characters during Shippuden and 5+ on. Plus, since this anime is so huge by the time you finish it the characters become like family to you.\
Enjoyment:5\
Naruto's battles are extremely fun to watch the the author gets extremely creative with his ninja abilities and powers. However, with the amount  of flashbacks and fillers, you won't be seeing too many exciting moments. The dialog progressively gets better with each season, so you have that to look forward to. \
(Gets a solid 10 for nostalgia rewatch value.)\
Overall: 6\
Naruto is not a terrible anime, but it's certainly not a great one either. Its cliche and stereotyped, but it's enjoyable, goofily bad, and manages to bring fond memories back. If you are the type of person who likes creative powers and rare but memorable fight scenes( and has a ton of time on their hands) this anime is for you.\
If you are someone looking for emotionally deep characters and stunning plot,  might not be the best choice.\

    Naruto is my first anime and is one of the most popular animes out there after it's sequel Naruto: Shippuden.\
Story was for me very enjoyable and fun. I like how they mixed up school and missions and got awesome storyline for everybody to like. Everything is about friendship, success in becoming a great ninja and honor. Once again story was very well done and I would not change a thing in it :D\
Art in Naruto is very simplistic, colorful with bright themes and even the ''scary parts'' look that way. You can see good artwork in detailed backgrounds but not in characters...yes they are noticeable\
          \
        in different ways, but not overdetailed as in some animes.\
Sounds I liked very much...I can say that the soundtracks did a lot for me and my enjoyment in anime. They go well with all scenes and characteristics; happy, funny, sad, agressive etc. There are some soundtracks with flute and shamisen that I enjoyed the most, so I always get goose-bumps when I hear that kind of music in Naruto =)\
The most important part that makes Naruto what it is are characters. Each different from other by looks, color, clothing, talk, ninja ranks, abilities and skills. They each have their own background story that helps the main storyline. They're all awesomely done and if you don't like anything else, you'll like the characters.\
I think I already talked about my enjoyment, so I'll just say this; yes, Naruto is maybe little overhiped, but no one should get in anime with a lot of expectations and I guess it's not the best anime ever (for me it is), but it's definitely worth watching =)\

    Naruto is one of my favorite mangas and tv shows in the world i think the art is pretty good but what caught my attention was the story. the character choices in this show were very good [ a hero, a guy that wants revenge, a girl who doens't know that she is liked but instead likes a guy that cant stand her, and a just plain weird old man who has some funny secrets.] \
enjoyment was awesome i fust wish they'd make the episodes longer than 30 minutes. i was always wanting more in the end. \

    Note: This review was written on my Review Book on Wattpad. If you are interested, don't be shy to check it out! (Link's in my bio)\
Ok, so if you guys don't know, Naruto is an action/martial arts/shounen anime, with a second season called Naruto Shippuden. Even though the manga was completed, the author, Masashi Kishimoto, has created a second series, or rather, a next generation, called Boruto. Though I haven't read any of that series what-so-ever, this review will be only on tt revolves around the series that revolves around Naruto. \
\
I was first introduced into anime becuase of Naruto, and I started picking up\
          \
        the manga at my library. I finished the manga in about a year, with every-other week trips to the library,  and I pretty much enjoyed it. Later on, I started watching the anime, and the rest is history. Sometimes I'll look at some things fan-made for the series, but I dont look into it that much anymore. \
\
WARNING! THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!\
\
Story: 8/10\
\
Naruto's story is pretty straight-forward: a child with spiky blond hair was hated and disliked because he had a demon stuck inside him. But as he developed to be a better ninja, he learned more about his lost parents, the demon deep inside him, and how to control the power that he was given. And even though everyone hated him (except for his stalker- I mean fellow ninja who crushed on him, Hinata, his rival, Rock Lee, and every last one of his senseis), Naruto had faith in everyone, and loved them all like family. Even when Sasuke had changed sides, and joined the Akatsuki, Nauto still believed in him, and cared about him unlike everyone (Maybe not like Sakura but...) . \
\
I decided to give the story in this anime an 8, because this anime does have potential, it really does, it's just the series is pretty much over-hyped. When I got into the series, I had high hopes that it was good as the fans of the series had said. Sure, I tolerated through the whole thing, and I'm not saying it's a bad series, just over-hyped. There's also a lot of dragged out parts that shouldn't have, especially the fighting scenes. Fights took several episodes, even though they could've been covered in one or two. Generally, I feel as if the story is pretty good over-all, but it's not a masterpiece like most people say it is. \
\
Art: 7/10\
\
Ok, so yes, I like some of the outfit designs given to certain characters (Ex: Kiba, Deidara, Hinata, etc.,), but others were, no offense, but really werent smart (*cough cough* Choji *chough cough*). I mean, when you give a character a bage to wear on their head like a pair of fricken panties, and you thought that was a good idea? I'm sorry but you have problems. Also, there were many flaws and errors in the graphic designs that are unforgettable, like some of the graphics with Pain. Yes, some of the results can be funny, like pausing Lost Pause or something, but I mean sometimes you'd see flaws in the animation without pausing. I feel as if I've seen better art and animation styles in later animes that I've seen. \
\
Sound: 8/10\
\
The soundtrack to this series is probably one of the most memorable parts to the series, especially some of the more sadder things, like Gaara's backstory. Though some of the fight themes could've deserved better themes, and the tribal-voice song thing wasn't as good either, but I'm deciding to give the soundtrack an 8, because most of it I enjoyed, and openings werent that bad either. \
\
Characters: 7/10\
\
The characters in Naruto have good and bad to them. I love how each character has a dream that is related to their backstory, and how some characters can relate to another in some way (Ex: Gaara and Naruto have been hated for the demons they posses inside them). But what I really don't like is Naruto's stupidity. And the fact that they stereotype women as if they can't do anything. \
Like seriously, first off, Naruto's stupidity isn't that silly, goofy-cute stupidity, like Nichijou is, it's just really annoying and immature stupidity, like after a while i was just like \"Okay Naruto, thats enough. Just fucking stop.\" \
\
Another thing: Girls are stereotyped as useless in this anime. Sure, I really dislike Sakura, but every time she or any other female character tries to make a difference in the show, the spotlight and glory is shined on Naruto and his male buddies. I mean, come on! If you don't want the women to do anything in the show then don't put them there! For example, there was like one guy in Magica Madoka, and he didn't really make a difference in the show, so the creators didn't use him that much. And that makes sense. But please, if you're going to create a bunch of \"Main Characters\" that arent going to do anything at all besides waste space, then dont add them at all. So, in conclusion, because even though we have some problems that include stereotyping and personality traits in some protaginists, I decided to give this section of my review an 7/10.\
\
Enjoyment/General: 6/10\
\
Seeing this was the very first anime I had ever watched, I thought that it was pretty good. But, for some reason, when I go back to it, I feel as if the series was a bit overhyped, and after I finished Naruto, there were other animes that I just enjoyed a lot more than Naruto. Yes, it was a good anime to start out with three years ago for me, but as I had more internet advantages, I had the chance to branch out my variety in anime and manga, and I found a ton of better animes. And for some reason I seem to enjoy the less likely animes rather than the ones that everyone talks about. So in general, I'd give Naruto a 6, a 5 at the least. It wasn't one of my personal favorites, but I'm pretty sure there are plenty of crappy animes to move it up the list. \

    Naruto is a mediocre anime but the main reason why everyone remembers it better than it actually was is because nostalgia. I'm sure plenty of old Naruto watchers used to do that stupid run and stuff like that makes people remember it more. The story is aight and same goes for the art. The soundtrack is alright as some of the sound effects are memorable,I can't say the same about it's OP and ending besides Fighting Dreamers. The characters are the usual shonen protagonist. Bullied kid,Cocky Bastard,Useless girl,A sensei to teach him shit. Naruto is the embodiment of the classic Anime protagonist. Even though it's\
          \
        a mediocre show,I enjoy it purely based on nostalgia. If you're in your early teens,you'll probably like this but if you're in your latter teens/adults,you're gonna cringe a ton. You probably shouldn't watch this.\

    Introduction\
*Skip this paragraph if you don't want to read me blabbering on and on and want to go to the story review part.*\
Naruto is a great anime that I have watched so far, I started off with Naruto Shippuden at first because I didn't know about the original Naruto. I then, held on to Naruto Shippuden at about episode 200 when I found out about Naruto. After I started the first few episodes, I was very hooked and it seemed really cool seeing Naruto when he was young and knowing the back stories of Naruto. I finished watching all the episodes in about 1-2 weeks,\
          \
        due to the fact that I was on Summer Break and had the whole day free to do as I please. \
\
Story 9/10\
In the beginning of the anime, the first few episodes was great. They gave me tears when I was watching them because it was both joyful and sad. \
Later on, the story began to get me very hooked due to all the action, friendship, and training in it. It taught me many lessons and got me thinking. The fighting and action in it was enjoyable and didn't last too long or too short like many other action anime. \
What made me give a 9/10 instead of a 10 full was because:\
First, I didn't like the too many fillers that didn't relate to the story and was very boring.\
Second, the fighting was repetitive,\
Lastly, I didn't like the flash backs that Naruto had *SPOILER* about Sakura, Sasuke, and him. *END OF SPOILER*\
\
(Or if you want to avoid the boring parts, skip to the Overall Review)\
Art and Sound 10/10\
First of all, the art was great considering when the anime was made. The art included lots of detail and the colouring was great. \
Next, the sound for the dub that I was watching was very good. I didn't notice any mistakes in it at all.\
\
I might have lots of Spoilers here during the Character Review so if you don't want any spoilers, skip to Enjoyment Review\
Character 7/10\
The characters were okay but *SPOILER* I didn't really like how Naruto's personality was being all goofy and weak.\
I personally didn't like how Sakura treated Naruto very poorly, and Sasuke like he was the hero of everything. \
I also didn't like how all Naruto's classmates including his friends, Sakura and Sasuke treated Naruto and bullied him. But I guess the bullying made Naruto stronger and not weak anymore.\
The last thing I didn't like was how Sasuke showed off all the time and called Naruto a loser.  *END OF SPOILER*\
Now, moving on to what I did like. *SPOILER* I liked how Naruto's character developed from a weak crying boy, into a strong, never giving up kid.\
I also really liked the scene when Naruto fought Kabuto to save Tsunade and him not giving up even though he had little chance of beating Kabuto. *END OF SPOILER*\
\
Enjoyment 10/10\
Even though there were some minor things that I didn't like, I really did enjoy this anime. It is one of the few best anime I've watched. This anime is really enjoyable and if you haven't watched it yet, GO WATCH IT NOW!\
\
Overall 9/10\
This anime is just great with some minor mistakes/annoyance in it. As I said in the Enjoyment Review, if you haven't watched this anime, GO WATCH IT NOW!!\

    Naruto is the best anime i have ever watched till date. Except from few fillers it has great story line, good characterization and great music. Coming to the characters naruto has been the most influential character besides goku, he wants to be recognized by each and every one in his village who think he is  monster, he overcomes each and every hardships coming in his way to achieve his goal . Naruto also has some epic battles. Naruto will motivate everyone to strive through their hardships and miseries in their life and will definitely impact your life.His tireless days of training, his bombastic and\

        confident, yet sympathetic and righteous attitude are a set of values that I strive towards.\

    One of my fav ANIME. People say it's a long series but for the people who have kept up with it, u know how kool this show is. The story is funny, even without romance it displays a mature side of ninja (usually ppl joke about bein ninja and laugh at it) this anime shows the part of the pain of reality. The evolution of characters is like watching someone grow up. Touching, at some episodes it'll make you squeal, cry, laugh, yell, and many more. Honestly its like life in some aspects but the thing is its very different. The characters you'll fall in\
          \
        love with, many different qualities and personalities. Random moments (if u ever watch it, look up episode 101^^) opening songs, personally ive liked them, not all tho. At times you can relate to the characters perfectly and that's exactly why you'll like this anime. But warning, do NOT try to do the thingz they do on the show. It's animation, keep in mind anything is basically possible so dont go trying to climb a tree or punch it a thousand times.\

    So ever since I started watching Naruto - I've read the manga, and only recently decided to give the anime a go - I've been, for some reason, unconsciously comparing it to Shingeki no Kyojin - my all-time favourite manga.\
After the first episode of Naruto, I gave the show an 8. It was good. I'll give you that. The majority of anime don't get any more than a 6 from me usually. Shingeki no Kyojin, after the first episode, also got an eight. But I only changed that 8 to a 9 after the tenth Naruto episode, while Shingeki no Kyojin's eight turned into an\
          \
        immediate 10 after the second episode. Now, why is that? I'll try and explain.\
Firstly: sfx and music. The atmosphere set up in Shingeki no Kyojin by the music accompaniments is absolutely flawless. In Naruto, I find that those things aren't as good. Some of the sfx and music are cliché. A lot of the 'touching' moments are filmed in such a terrible way that I couldn't decide if the show-makers intended us to understand it an a parodied way or a serious way. Maybe that's just me. But oh well, we all have our personal opinions.\
Secondly: characters. This may be because I've read the manga previously, but I feel that the characters in Naruto, from the very first episodes of the manga, are very predictable, excepting a few choice moments. In SNK, there is no such thing. Every new development is a surprise. Every twist, every turn of the wrist and every trip decision comes as a complete shock.\
Thirdly: direction of plot. One of the first things we hear Naruto say is that he wants to become the next Hokage. Since the show is named after him, we can safely assume, even from the first episode, that he will surmount all the coming obstacles and ascend to the position of Godaime no matter what obstacles lie in his path. I like the show, I really do. BUT THAT'S BORING. I don't like 'predictable' things - one of the reasons I prefer Shingeki no Kyojin. With SNK's plot, and with its developments, we have no idea whether or not killing the titans will ever be achieved. The main character's - Eren's - goal is to discover the outside world, and to do that he has to destroy the titans. He has no choice in the matter. It's that or getting killed. But with the number of deaths within the main characters and supporting characters, we could just as well safely assume that he'll get killed himself before he can even find out what the heck it was that his father left in his basement. Hell, even as I speak, Eren is being held captive in some rich guy's basement and about to be eaten by one of his best friends. And there seems to be no possible way out of it. A lot of the fans agree that it's possible he - the main character - will die. Naruto dying? Not possible. Never even considered. There can be no NARUTO without Naruto.\
Fourthly: this last one is personal taste, but I tend to prefer really serious mangas/animes with very few comic relief (Sacha and Connie are two of the only comic relief characters in SNK, while ALL of Naruto's characters provide comic relief), heavy plot, manipulations, intrigues, and whatnot. I find that Naruto (the show, not the character, because Naruto Uzumaki is one of the characters I relate to the most in any anime) has TOO much comic relief, and takes TONNES away from the beauty and intensity that could be the show.\
There's more, but I can't think how to put it into words. I tried my best not to give any SNK spoilers. No names.\
Hope this is helpful to anyone who's been thinking the same thing or was looking for a comparison of the two. If you want to contact me to talk about this, or for any other reason, actually, then do! I'd be glad to meet someone new.\

    The story started off slow enough, it doesn't help that pace gets slower once you hit the chunin exams  and  relief doesn't arrive till well past the introduction Tsunade.\
The decent fights are full of bloated dialogue\
What ticked me off  was how overhyped people that Sasuke was.\
What ticked me off even more was how filler increased when pace picked back up a bit around the Sasuke retrieval arc.\
WHAT TICKED ME off the most was how there were so many frocking prodigies. Allow me to list: Sasuke, Kakashi, Neji, Shikamaru, Haku, Itachi, Kimimaro, Jiarya, Orochimaru, Tsunade, Gaara, All the Aukatski, Any kage, basically anyone\
          \
        with kekkei ginkai. By the end even Naruto, the main character goes from idiot to prodigy in his own right.\
Maybe in this alternated world, prodigies are the majority and your special if your actually not a genius\

    After watching the entire of Naruto (fillers and all), I give the show a score of 8. It's not the best anime by any means' but it definitely has an endearing quality to it. If you're thinking about watching, go in knowing that there will be tedious fillers and that the show is not perfect, just enjoy the little details like character quirks and jokes which make Naruto great on a whole.\
In the first episode I did not like the main character, Naruto, at all but once I got into the main arc, I had come to appreciate him and eventually through out the 220\
          \
        episodes it was as if I was watching my brother grow up. The show brings a nostalgia, which is something I think is very difficult to achieve, I felt tremendously sad watching the last episode.\
Story line up until episode 130 was extremely engaging but after that the fillers spoiled it. The art is standard, it gets the story across but considering the how long ago it was created very understandable. The music of OP and ED were outstanding, I still have the songs in my head till this day and I don't think I will forget them anytime soon. All the characters have at least one good attribute (shout out to kakashi hatake, he made the show completely worth watching). I recommend this greatly, just give it sometime to grow on you.\

    The series would be alot more entertaining if it got to the point and stuck to the storyline. Too much of the series is made up of fillers that get old fast, while all the over exighted Sasuke fangirls want to know about is whatever happens to their preacious dickhead Uchiha, etc.\
The beginning is boring but it gets much more interesting later in the game. It also gets way better once you get past the enormous brick of fillers and into shippuden. \

    Pros: everything, but only up to about the first 50 episodes (plus the clashes between the 3 legendary shinobidos later on)\
Cons: everything since then\
The anime is well viewed and understood. It thus does not require synoptic reviews. I'll just share some personal experience with the anime.\
I started watching the series a lot later than most people, but once I started, I had no trouble comprehending the frenzies my friends would have about the series -- a tale of ninja and their mysterious techniques (grown up in China, I love all things elemental-related when it comes to magics and fantasies), a depiction of the hierarchy and\
          \
        conflicts in the Japanese Warring era, and a ballard of growing-up with tears, efforts and friendship. It was an awesome escape from the real world, with either new shinobido techniques or new character stories to reveal every episode-- there is always mystery, suspension, and action.\
However, (as with all things, there has to be a \"however\"), that's only up to about 60 episodes, if I recall right. After that, the series is reduced to episodic missions that do not further the storyline or introduce any new techniques. The motifs of each small story are boring and blank at best. The whole series simply turned into a repetitive, dungeon-ish, adventure anime probably only geared for grade-schoolers.\
Just to name one of its vice, it occurs in every single episode that some character, in a super intensive, emergent and often life-threatening situation (as depicted by the character's monologue anyway), would somehow freeze and take ages to make the simplest decision or the most obvious tactical observation -- as if the viewers all have IQ of none when viewing this series. What does the anime itself do during all these pauses? About 7 seconds zooming in on the same frame. And then? Another 7 seconds zooming out! If not longer!!\
It's almost sever to the point that I can barely enjoy the episodes as animations but instead voiced CG drama.\
I gave up after a few episodes of those, obviously. I would revisit the series occasionally and only receive disappointment - not to anybody's surprise.\
Hence, my overall rating -> 3/10, in a protest against the inattention of the producer to the later part of the series, while the partial ratings remain high, in a tribute to the series' quickly-diminished potential.\
EDIT:\
Unlike normal rating, the word clause remains neutral/positive until the score is lower to as bad as 3 when writing a comment -> partly the reasons for the low score.\

The storyline? A young boy, Naruto Uzumaki, is possessed by a demon, the Nine-Tailed Fox. He's treated as a misfit, but in spite of this, he wants to be the Hokage. He goes to Ninja Academy, fights the Akatsuki menace, and tries to locate his teammate Sasuke.\

There was really nothing unique about the art. the artwork was pretty much average throughout the entire series. However the artwork really shines when it gets to fighting scenes.\

The songs pulls you into the situation of the characters whether it be sadness, anger, or happiness. It makes the characters feel more real and can sympathize with.\

        might be feeling. I don't why people complain so much about the flashbacks. They don't bother me, it helps you feel for the charactes.\

What I really like about Naruto is it doesn't have just fighting and battles. ( Of course it does have that) It has comedy and little hints of romance. And especially emotion.\

    Let's face it, this is a good shonen anime. The second anime that I had watched in my life (first being Dragonball). Overall I can say, it was a fun experience until I discovered panties, moe, and Evangelion. There are flamers and there are fanboys whose list also include bleach and One Piece and such other shonen animes of the same caliber. Enough about the basics let's get into the review.\
Story - Not what everyone wants, but it WORKS. That's the most important part, it WORKS. It's nice and interesting, doesn't have to be as long as it is. Fillers, not so much, i like\
          \
        how they get into the side characters, but there are better ways to do it then just send them on a mission together.\
Not so much romance going on. Would've made things more interesting. good at explaining things that happened in the past as such.\
Can't approve of all the plot devices used. Some are too cheap and i would have preferred if the story was darker and centered around a sadistic Naruto instead of a headstrong mentally handicapped person.\
I give it a 7 - Not bad, did it's job for a shonen and the main plot line is still followable.\
Art - Not bad but I've seen a few freeze frames that made me Lol. Not much ecchi or ero shot/Special Effects, so i can't say much. It's pretty basic.\
7 - little things here and there. Not phenomenal, passes.\
Sound - Again, very basic. fighting sounds were also basic. Music was good. Voice acting, like able. Didn't launch any voice actors into fame.\
7 - nothing more to say.\
Character: There weren't really any characters i truly disliked in the series. Stupid trolls flaming something they don't understand, fanboys are obsessed based on their primal instincts. Both have little to no grip on what makes a character and that's what makes them the animals they are.\
The villains appealed more to me than the main characters. They had more darker, complicated back stories that i sympathized with and had taken a liking to.\
There were way too many characters than there needed to be. Either have them be an iconic background character or make them a main character. You can only have so much in the supporting role.\
Their pasts are very basic and I'm not going to review it on a level of a person who has seen some deep stuff and is very experienced with those sort of tropes. The people watching this should be little kids that should be educated on these sorts of story structure and understand how they work. This anime does what is needed. And the lack of character depth is probably to appeal to a younger audience as well as well as release as many games, toys, and cosplay costumes as possible. That fact however doesn't come on as strong though.\
I had some favorites which means this deserves nothing less than a 7, some bad some good, balances it out. If i had taken out all the characters i disliked i would've given it at least an 8.\
Enjoyment - Did I enjoy it? No, this differs from viewer to viewer and to me I wouldn't have the attention span to stay in my chair to watch this. Instead I'd be watching this while doing something else in the background, not even caring to read the subs.\
This is something I'd give to my younger siblings to get them started on anime. They would love this stuff, and it'll prepare them for better animes by setting the bar very low on the first time. Watching a masterpiece as the first anime, really takes the luster away from the animes you would have enjoyed if you hadn't watched this first.\
So always watch this first before you go into Code Geass.\
6 - and this won't affect the overall score this is completely unrelated.\
This is indeed better than Bleach (a lukeworm anime that excels no direction in particular, read my review for it).\
Overall grade - 7\
I think it's great for it to be as overrated as this is. It's basically the front gate for newcomers in to the anime universe, and being the position as it's in, i'd prefer to have it as overrated as possible. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for this anime. I wish it luck in it's future stories.\
Let the little kids have fun, we can enjoy it from time to time in nostalgia, but I don't recommend it to anyone who wants deep story. If you don't like it, take it to a youtube video.\

    Naruto-one of the world's most famous anime and manga series, that even people in countries like my own hear about even when it is not airing on the TV. \
It took some time before I decided to watch Naruto, because of ninjas(well the naruto world of ninja is really good si I got very surprised) and I thought it was just the same in every episode-they met a new enemy, defeated it and then it was done. And well there were also so many episodes, but don't let that stop you!\
This is my first review, but I'll try my best!\
STORY(10/10)\
The story is really a masterpiece.\
          \
        Many of the characters past and background are alike many humans in the real world. I really know some of the pain the characters were going through, even when I'm not a ninja or something.\
It is easily to get hooked and there were times when I even cried. I really love the story because of its sad and happy times. \
But then the fillers came(which lasted for over 85 episodes). I know that the fillers made many people stop watching Naruto, and it is of course alright to skip them(you don't loose any of the story) but well, I watched it myself, ALL of them. They are really the worst I have ever seen. There were some interesting ones, there was one or two fillers that had a little bit of fantasy in it if I could say so.\
Anyway, when I look at the real story it is so super good that it gets a 10!\
\
But then there was the fillers(yes, over 85 episodes!)\
ART(8/10)\
The art was good too. Sometimes the background looks completly real! The charactars are detailed and I think most scenes are all right with it's art. There's just one problem, sometimes the characters are drawn really bad and it is easily to see when that happends. But I understand that, this is a really long series. But even so, the art can become much better.\
SOUND(8/10)\
The sound fits with the mood of nearly all scenes, especially the sad ones. I really wish they could use more emotional pieces, and they use the same music very often. \
CHARACTER(9/10)\
Most of the characters are really interesting with their backgrounds and stories. But well it is often you get tired of Naruto, but it is really impressing me how he developes through the episodes(suddenly he is more marture). I nearly give this a 10, the only problem, the only problem is that there are a little bit too much characters. Like Ino(for example), she doesn't do anything important in the series(well it was the story of her friendship with Sakura). Anyway, I really like most of the characters.\
ENJOYMENT(10/10)\
I did really enjoy watching Naruto. It was unique, it was exciting, it was great. Now I really like ninjas. The funny bits are a bit childish often, but you will definetily laugh sometimes. I remember a time when I was watching Naruto I was eating noodles at the same time as Naruto was eating ramen in an episode.\
OVERALL(10/10)\
It is much in Naruto that could have been much better, but at the same time the story and characters are fantastic and you just can't stop watching it. That is why Naruto is my favorite. I highly recommend everyone to watch it! \

    First things first: because of the obvious deviation and independence from the main story of the Naruto filler material, I am not regarding it as part of the series. I prefer to think of it as misplaced OVA material.\
Fillers aside, I find this an awesome series, very well constructed, mixing great battle intensity with intricate major and side plots, and placing focus on character development. Only in its last arc does it drag for too long, and for a while it becomes almost arcade like - battle after battle after battle. Story stays on hold for a while, and for that reason it earns no\

    I don't mean to be cruel but naruto was a total idiot at the beginning of the anime, and was clumsy. He wasn't a very good ninja until the rest of the anime started showing naruto learning new skills, and growing more mature.

    (review fixed)\
Naruto is a really popular anime. And by really popular, I mean REALLY popular. Scoring a bunch of toys, video games, abridged series, and even survival on two different children's networks (which is hard for an anime unless it's toyetic), it has to be good.\
And that's the only part of the review I left from my past review. You see, I was a 12, maybe 13-year-old weeaboo when I wrote my past review and gave Naruto a 9. Now, as I look back on my past review, it is terrible. It's time to fix some things.\
STORY: 4/10: HEYYYYYY! I'M NAR-ROO-TOEEEEE! LOOK WHAT I DID\
          \
        THIS TIIIIIME!\
I just described the first season to you in a nutshell. Naruto can be fun on occasion, such as during the Chunin exams, but guess who's really weighing my rating down? NARUTO. He is pretty much anime's response to Johnny Test.\
ART: 6/10: The art is still good. The designs are quite detailed.\
SOUND: 6/10: Some of the OPs will always be annoying to me, but sometimes I still catch myself humming Japanese insert songs from Naruto.\
CHARACTER: 6/10: This could easily be higher without Naruto. I'm still interested in Sasuke's story to this day, and will probably find myself taking a peek at the final chapters if more of Sasuke is revealed.\
ENJOYMENT: 5/10: I used to love this series, but then I took an arrow to the knee. And by \"arrow to the knee\", I mean I found better anime\

    Naruto is way over-ally overrated!\
\
\
That's what you wanted to read, right? I say its only a little bit overrated. Its famous because its original. Leave it alone. You can not say some else's opinion is worse than yours. Its pretty lame to knock down the majority of opinions for your own. Its only a bit overrated because it does not have the best music or art. It has average art and cheesy music. But the story is developed quite nicely and it gets your heart pumping. Enjoyment is the most important thing here. What other reason would you watch an anime for? \
Story: The story\
          \
        is amazing! You cannot knock naruto down. There are ninjas with special powers they made themselves! The main character has a sad setup too! It makes it all the more interesting.  It even has a world economy built into the story! I know there are only villages in each country, but that's okay. I'd say there are weak points in the story though. There are a couple electronics in this society and hospitals which does not make sense because they do not have cars or planes or ships. It also does not tell us what planet naruto is on or what time period it is based in. \
Art: I thought the art was pretty average. It was not spectacular (especially on episode 1) but it was bearable. I thought the noses and ears of the characters looked pretty weird. Ah! Annoying to look at. The fight scenes were pretty awesome and well done though. The art in them was amazing, and made the scenes all the more interesting to watch.  \
Sound: Hmm.. I say it's fairly done. I thought it was pretty cheesy, but I got attached to it. The soundtrack fits really well with what anime it's going with though. It moves the anime along quite well. If you listen to the songs without watching the anime though, you may find them quite boring or weird. The openings and endings of the show have really well done music in them. I     enjoyed all the intro and outro songs. Hopefully you do as well. \
Character development: This is not poorly done, but i'd say it lacks a lot. In the second series of naruto,there is a whole lot more development. I just don't understand why they had to have such average development in the first series. There is hardly any character development with anyone besides the main characters. I know you will probably disagree, but it's true. Many are left with a bad after taste after watching this first show. Its really hard to understand where some of the characters are going. \
Enjoyment: This series is thoroughly enjoyable. It has a lot of fillers yes, but the fillers are quite enjoyable too. The fillers made me laugh hell of a lot, or made me feel relief from the intensiveness of the real story. It may make a lot of people complain of how repetitive this show can get, but i feel it adds to it. Its not bad to repeat ideas and expand on them. It's only impatient people who get frustrated with repetition.  \
Overall, it's a good watch. I recommend it to anyone who has time on their hands and wants to watch an upbeat show. It's fairly interesting, and never gets boring (at least for me.).  \
Warning: There are huge fillers everywhere in the show. Without them there would only be 140 episodes... not 220. I suggest you skip them and maybe watch them later when you run out of everything naruto. Do whatever you want. \

     Masashi Kishimoto's Naruto in my opinon was and is an outstanding anime. The story line was well written, the charcters well developed, The soundtrack was good and the art deserves a thumbs up. \
The moral of the story is different for each person who reads and watchs naruto, but to see such wonderful characters change and grow with each episode and chapter that is produced could make anyone pleased if they had the eyes, ears and heart to see it. I would recommend this anime/manga to anyone who likes a lilttle action and a good story line. :)\

    For newcomers to anime and for the younger audience, Naruto is a great anime to kickstart your journey.\
However, as with many long-running anime, the fillers are absolute garbage. I would have rated it higher, if it stopped after 135.\
Also, there were only moments of memorable magic, with the rest being quite forgetable.\
My favourite part of the story is Naruto's upbringing and his will to fight. I thought that was quite inspiring.\

    Naruto is an anime that I would call overrated because you hear more from people hating it then ones who like it. And I think a lot of that is because people want a shows full of mindless violence and flat characters that look cool like DBZ and Bleach. I find Naruto to be much better then either of those. Naruto and One Piece are my favorite Shonen series.\
What sets Naruto apart, for me, is the world Kishimoto has formed and how every character has his or her own distinct fighting style and personality and dreams and goals. The plot has plenty of twists without\
          \
        becoming complicated and you never have 10+ episodes of fighting one bad guy like in DBZ. Things move at a fast pace most of the time. There are times when it gets boring and the filler is annoying. I just skip it and I am surprised most people just don't look up which episodes are filler and skip them. Simple.\
Unlike shows like Bleach, Naruto has remained popular in Japan (Bleach being canceled and replaced by a show starring a Naruto side character is proof of that) because it is not the same recycled plot over and over and over and you do really grow to care about the character.\
Naruto does not deserve all of the hate it gets. I watch a lot of different anime and Naruto is what it is and should be enjoyed as a long running Shonen series with lots of fun for people with an open mind to it. I think people go into every anime expecting a masterpiece and pick them apart for no good reason. Just let go and have fun. You just might enjoy it.\

    I'm a short and sweet kind of reviewer\
Overall I do believe that is so is very, very over hyped, at the same time it doesn't live up to it. what I mean is the majority of fans will like it be able to follow the story and have little to no complaints, but people who may have higher standards for animes.\
For me this is the first anime I ve watched all of the way through every episode. some of things I liked was the character development, the characters don't have a random spike in power, or just some bullcrap a randomly happen. its a slow\
          \
        steady climb and when the he there peak power is feels natural. another thing I liked was how they pulled your emotions through the story. it was kind of like real life in away. every time a character grew and though they were at the max somebody was better than them and challenged them to grow even more..\
some things I hated was the overlapping of episodes. most of them were the filler episodes but there were some cannon episodes did kind of retell what happen the last one and it was the whole episode, or even the origin stories were at least 2-3 episodes long which was annoying to me.\
Overall this does hold a special place in my heart as the first anime I watched all the way through, and has I said at the start this is a great anime for people wanting to get into it so I suggest you what it but don't get your hopes to high\

    Yo fine people of myanimelist.net, I'm about to set this whole Naruto debacle to rest so sit tight, get a blanket and get damn comfy cause this is coming rough and raw.\
Let me start by saying you need to get rid of your f**ks all of them until there's nothing left but a child like sense of wonder and a hunger for adventure with a thirst for escaping reality  , put them f**ks  in a basket or a storage cabinet somewhere where you can use them for an anime that is thought provoking because that isn't Naruto.\
What Naruto is ladies and gentlemen is\
          \
        a quest of the imagination and an adventure of the soul, It ain't gonna tease your brain, It ain't gonna make you fall madly in love with characters in fact more than a few will piss you off BUT ladies and gentlemen what Naruto will do is have you coming back episode after episode like a crack cocaine fiend.\
How you ask? Why through none other than damn fine story telling, good and at times beautiful artwork and sheer blunt enjoyment. Time for some further detail folks. We gonna start with the good and work toward the worse here.\
STORY\
Most synopsis of Naruto state that it's the tale of a young boy Naruto Uzimaki and his quest to become the greatest village leader in the history of the village (Through brutal ninja slaughter of other villages) but i'd like to say that it's just the base story (there is a multitude of and intriguing mini  stories and sub plots in Naruto). The real story in Naruto is about friendship, see people, in life friends sometimes grow apart, different interests and the pressures of life take their toll and people go their separate ways, it's happened to me and i'm sure it's happened to a few of you. This happens in Naruto and my boy Naruto say's \"f**k no\" leading to a fantastic adventure to regain what has been lost, truly touching stuff here folks.\
SOUND\
It took me a while to realize just how big of an effect the tunes in an anime,Tv show or movie has on the overall experience, due to this i decided to take a look back over Naruto and the soundtrack it provides for a better analysis. Hot damn was i happy with it, an almost perfect selection of songs that will have you feeling tense or at ease depending on the scene as well as songs that help portray mystery and wonder when necessary. In summary the soundtrack really helps compliment the whole atmosphere of the Naruto series.\
ART\
A lot of people doing reviews on Naruto will probably bitch about the artwork saying it's \"patchy\" and what not. Don't listen to em folks don't do it, see what these people don't realize is the cost,time and effort it takes for these companies to hire Pro animators who basically do slave work spending days on end animating a single scene. Naruto is one of the longest running manga/anime out there so its easy to imagine costs are high. It also provides excellent action sequences and when the Naruto series calls for good animation it delivers it, when it doesn't require it, it doesn't provide it simple as peoples.\

Now if there were an area in which the Naruto series falls down for me it would surly be the characters.Why you ask? well because i feel that more than one of it's large ensemble of characters are incredibly one dimensional with the main focus of character development being on our two main characters and a handful of minor characters and even with this in mind the development of said characters is incredibly slow. Also with such a large ensemble of characters more than a few pissed me off with their quirky ways (Also Sakura is one of the most useless, worthless and genuinely SHIT female protagonists i've ever seen). Now if there is a saving grace for the characters of Naruto then for me it would be the antagonists, i say this because the series crafts them Lovely backstories that allows you to understand what lead them to their wicked ways rather than the usual bullshit in anime that has an evil character who is just evil for the heck of it.\
Terribly sorry about droning on here chaps so ima wrap this review up with a suggestion, don't analyze it, don't critique it and just sit back and enjoy it, if you watch it with the above in mind it's sure to be a roller coaster ride of epic fun. Peace\
Much Love\

    Well, my first review on this website - lets see how this goes!\
So, I like to think of myself as a definite otaku (...sad to admit, I know). However if being obsessed over anime is what 'otaku' means then I most definitely fit the description.\
Naruto was the second anime I watched when I was beginning my 'japanese cartoon' journey and I'll tell you all now - if you want to get yourself dedicated to a shounen/ninja/hero/action anime with a little emotional rollarcoaster thrown in with a bucket of laughs to top it off then Naruto is definitely one to get yourself attached to. True, you\
          \
        might think I'm going into this with a bias opinion and I probably am however I'm going to write a review anyway.\
Story:-\
          I gave the story a 9 because despite my never ending love for the anime it does contain a few plot holes which (depending on how hard you look) are noticable when you look back. For example; parents! We don't see enough of the parents buuuut nagging parents aren't something you want in an action packed anime. It might just be the hardcore fans that need the little details (I know I certainly do). And when I say little details, that's all they really are. The story arcs all eventually link together towards the end of Shippuden (which is the sequal season to Naruto) but you can tell that at the beginning of Naruto they didn't know they were going to have a second season.\
Art:-\
       I gave the art an 8. Now I was a bit skeptical of my choice because the only reason I'm not marking it a nine is because of it's age. It was first released in 2002 so you can only imagine the old animating style they used to have then. You can clearly see the progression of the style as time goes on. In the main areas of animation; speaking, running, fighting etc I'd say they're top notch for the resources they had 'back in the day'. \
Sound:-\
            I gave this a 10 because of the soundtrack. Naruto (and Shippuden) has some of the most beautiful and emotional music in the anime community. When I'm looking at Youtube comments I can see that people who don't want the anime are listening to this music. It's amazing. Simply put. And when put to the animation it's even more incredible. Such an experience! Real edge of your seat stuff! (I don't mean to sound cheesy).\
Character:-\
                 This is where Naruto gets a liiiittle flawed. I'm giving it an 8 because of the way they sometimes portray little girls. And I don't mean anything to do with hentai, Christ no, I just mean sometimes they forget how young girls are. You know it; crying. And this is where I'll leave it for 'character' because I don't want you to go into this anime clouded by the fact they portray some girls a little annoying. \
Enjoyment:-\
                  Well, obviously a 10! I, to this day, enjoy Naruto as much as I did when I first started it. Thoroughly enjoy every episode, including the fillers. \
Overall:-\
             I gave it a 9 all together because of the two 8s and two 10s. Overall a fantastic anime which came to it's end at 220 episodes. When you get to the end, God, you don't know how to feel. You don't know if you can ever feel again. But it's worth, afterwards you get a whole season more!\
WhooO!\
I think I lost steam towards the end but I hope you find the time in your schedule to add this in. It's a great anime!\

    Well it's been a lot of time since I finished Naruto. I should probably watch it once again to review it, but sincerely, I don't have the guts to do so.\
I remember it being catchy at the time, I was a teenager and I related a lot to Naruto and his sensation of friendship towards Sasuke, his crush on Sakura, who in turn did like Sasuke but depised him and Hinata's crush on Naruto and his being to stupid to notice it. \
It was involving back then.\
In hindsight, it looks like a pretty adolescent plot, which it is, so I think it fits better for\
          \
        teenagers and indeed I think a teenager would like it.\
I remember thinking about the art and the animation being of average quality back then, the plot interesting the protagonists where well developed throughout the anime's lifetime. However I think some characters were not well developed though.\
Overall, a good anime which I was quite fond of at the time and it brings me good memories. Not too impressive though, I think it's an average anime on the whole.\

    Naruto is a series that fallows a little Genin named Naruto (no surprise there). It is a very high rating animated story (I believe it's right up there as number 1, or at least in the top 3). Why might that be? Perhaps it's because of how great and promising the idea seems to those who don't watch the entire thing. I've seen every last episode, and I can still say that I understand why it has such a high rating. \
To put it simply: there are over 200 episodes, which can seem pretty daunting. I know I don't like anime that will take up\
          \
        a whole lot of my time. Obviously, there were going to be fillers since it would take a lot more master-work to make 220x24 minutes of pure base-plot. Now, I'm not saying this is a horrid series, I'm just saying that at times I just wanted to skip forward but couldn't (as it's in my nature to watch everything so I can see if they're foreshadowing an event in the near or distant future). \
Story: Naruto was basically the first anime that I was consciously aware of as being an anime. I watched it as a dub at first when it showed up on Disney XD, then continued on to watch it subbed so I could watch more of it with cool accents and fast words (it helps your reading rate). The driving point of the story didn't deter me because I thought it was childish. In fact, because of Naruto's dream, and the way he wanted to grow up, and all the friends that he wanted to make, I grew to love the series. But that doesn't mean that it earned a great mark. (6/10 - Fair)\
Art: The artwork was beautiful. At first, it seemed a bit jerky with the movements, but over time you could see as it improved. The character drawings in themselves were masterpieces with their facial expressions and the way the animators seemed to know just where to put a windy element and whatnot. Even the fighting scenes were realistic, with their skins seeming to stretch out in slow motion as they were punched. (9/10 - Great)\
Sound: The OP's and ED's, especially the OST's, were truly amazing. They set me in a fighting or a sad mood, then made me feel happy again and hope as the characters faced off the enemy that they absolutely had to beat. I wish I could download the songs and just listen to them over and over again while staring out into the rain... but I have school to attend. (9/10 - Great)\
Character: The characters were cliche, and I found myself hating some of the main characters. One of the things that I hated most was getting this 3-episode long flashback of one character. I realize that it's good for gathering more information on someone, but there are some characters that are just too minor or just don't need such a lengthy flashback. Honestly, sometimes it felt like it was being dragged out just to make more episodes. There are some instances that I liked watching them, and then there were some where they repeated a flashback from way-back-when over and over again. Of course, Naruto is one of these cliche characters. Now, don't get me wrong, this is why I loved him and the series. Naruto was a boy that wanted to save others without becoming a monster. He used most opportunities to sound profound and look like a hero. If I hadn't seen his past, I would have hated him and wondered what gave him the right to talk like that. But I know that he had every right because I knew him, and I knew who he was going to be. (5/10 - Mediocre)\
Enjoyment: I cant' say I didn't enjoy watching this series (though I can say I wouldn't have enough time to watch it again). It was my first anime, and I loved it. I still love it. That would make the rating I gave it seem kind of confusing, but it's like one of those little brothers/sisters that you don't like but love anyways. The characters took me places with their determination and the soundtracks let me ride their waves to the right moods. The ending left me feeling hollow until I picked up the sequel. But it did not completely measure up. (6/10 - Fair)\
So, overall, this was a 6/10 anime, which means it was fair enough. I would recommend it to anyone just because I know that it's a great series to watch. When I rate it, I look at all the 220 episodes combined. Had it been shorter (perhaps 50 or something since I can't think of packing all of it into a simple 20 episode-series) I would have rated higher since there wouldn't have been as much to go over. \

    Naruto is an interesting anime that i don't really know how to explain very well.\
This anime is filled with action, sad moments, happy moments, moments of confusion, and many lessons. This anime is also very unique and i would say definitely deserves the high ratings it has. The story, the art, the ideas, and the characters are all completely original and you will definitely not find another anime even similar to this one.\
I think it is a nice anime to watch and should be watched.\

    Ah Naruto the classic anime underrated by these dbz loving so-called \"experts\" with a very original but simple concept if you think about it i mean sure some parts can be callled cliche for example the hidden power thing but be that cast aside its a epic storyline about his journey to bring back his best friend\
Story: It starts with him beeing an outcast in his own village, joining a group of genin shinobi with the two genins Sakura and Sasuke he begins practically hating Sasuke but they begin earning each others mutual respect and befriending each other as rivals when the antagonist starts appealing\
          \
        to Sasukes dark past and his thirst for revenge it ends up in him leaving the village having Naruto and Sakura desperatly searching for clues on his whereabouts. i give the story10/10\
\
Art and Animation: well its a well drawn anime and compared to the shitty dragonball art it can be counted as epic but ive seen better and animation was pretty good or at least in the fights \
and as for the the characters well they were great sure some cliches like iill die protecting my friends and that but that still matches well with the story and though Naruto's character shaping would probably be pretty stereotype in the anime world and sure sakura is the typical schoolgirl personality all of that matches in with the story, and not to mention the awesome support charcters\
But the main thing about Naruto is that youll enjoy it very much and if you watch naruto youll never ever consider watching such shitty  art as dragonball",

    Naruto. An anime that probably everyone has heard of.\
I first began watching this as a child and grew accustomed to the bright and crazy tale of Naruto Uzumaki, but it was soon lost in my past.\
After picking it up again, I was stunned as to how much I could now appreciate it after reading the manga and becoming a reasonably seasoned anime viewer.\
I soon became re-absorbed into the world of the shinobi, with Naruto Uzumaki the number one knuckle head ninja of the leaf.\
The story in inclusive and beautifully told, the art is stunning and cheerful but knows when to bring in deeper colours for\
          \
        the more saddening areas.\
The character development is what I found most interesting though. As expected for a 220 episode anime, there is a lot of character development, but what made me even more interested was the fact that characters that are side-characters or  have a smaller role in the tale, their background and stories are told with just as much depth as the main characters.\
Overall, I found Naruto not just a fun and exciting anime, but a beautiful work of art that even had me close to tears.\
I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of ninjas, japan, serious storyline, with a lot of fun on the side. \

Given the voracity of the backlash against the “not-so-bad” rating that Naruto received upon initial viewing by a fellow reviewer, I am certain that many readers eagerly anticipate a reviewer that, upon broader viewing (or even being of dissimilar gender from the original critic), will vindicate their pristine opinion of this title. Unfortunately you, the reader, are stuck with me. While I don’t think poorly of this title by any stretch of the imagination, the buzz pervading Naruto is plainly more hype than substance.\
So where does the hype begin you ask? Right off the bat. From the very beginning of episode one this title more\
          \
        or less pronounces itself to be of the cookie-cutter Shonen Jump variety, and only a somewhat above average one at that. The character for which the show is named, Naruto, is quickly introduced, and even before the end of the first episode the viewer is completely aware of the ultimate direction of the plot: Naruto will someday become the strongest ninja of his village and receive the highly coveted title of Hokage. But knowing the end of the plotline isn’t as much of a killjoy as one would expect. It is the ride that counts after all. However, in the case of Naruto the ride is tantamount to that of an old, wooden roller coaster: sometimes thrilling and often nostalgic, yet still quite a bit rickety and easily outdone in terms of excitement and quality.\
The characters, like the plot, are mostly OK while being admittedly cliched. Uzumaki Naruto, our primary character, is much like the leads of many of the most popular fight-styled anime. Like Goku (of Dragon Ball fame), Naruto is headstrong, motivated (mostly to become stronger), and cares deeply about his comrades. Like Yuusuke (of Yu Yu Hakusho fame), Naruto is rambunctious, brash, and a bit of a slacker. Despite his being particularly formulaic, Naruto at least combines the finer qualities of his predecessors. Such can not be said of his archrival Sasuke, a figure for whom blandness knows no depth. In fact, many of the characters fall somewhere in-between Sasuke’s blandness and Naruto’s charisma and coolness. You will come to care for the cast of Naruto for sure, just not at any deep or meaningful level.\
The animation, much like the characterization and plotting, is spotty. At times great while at other times shoddy, the quality of the animation here lacks any real consistency. During the arcs in which the animation is still on the minds of the animators, the viewer is treated to a fluid frame-rate and artistic renderings that leave little to be desired on the part of fans of the manga. Nevertheless, when the animation is bad it is painful. At these times the once faithful renderings degrade to craptastic levels. It is as if you can feel the framerates slipping before your very eyes. Like most aspects thus far examined, the animation of Naruto is a mixed bag indeed.\
It is perhaps a bit unfair though to judge a fight/action anime based upon factors such as characterization and plotting. True to its genre, it is in fight/action scenes that Naruto receives is highest accolades, though that isn’t saying a whole hell of a lot. Despite very wide employment, the fight scenes manage to remain remarkably fresh. With such a large extended cast, invigorating and unique fighting styles/techniques manage to continuously infuse action sets with life. Additionally, the background music manages to add some tension to these scenes quite effectively. There are some negative aspects to the action sets however. One is the overemployment of certain special techniques, particularly Naruto’s Shadow Clone technique, a move in which he creates multiple clones of himself. When a character uses the same move over and over and over and . . . well, things get bland and repetitive. Another detriment is that the sheer number of fights impedes the potency of plotting. Still, the combat stages are pretty intense and there are plenty of scenes for action fans to get pumped about.\

    This series starts off rather well, sets the story right and develops everyone's character at a simple level and everyone's ninja powers well.\
As the anime progresses it becomes crucial that you like Naruto's unwavering and blindly confident character. If not his odd speeches will get annoying and like myself you will often find minor characters a lot more interesting and you wish you could see more of them, or even if they were the main character instead. One of the cons may be that there are so many characters that the inclusion of all of them is difficult. With that, developing those many characters can\
          \
        mess with the pacing of the anime.\
When some side characters get into fights, the back story of them is then included within the fight which can get annoying and for many of the characters I really don't care about which made me skip most of their back stories.\
The story it self has a direction but the reader doesn't really have an idea of where it's going. Both good and bad so it's hard to tell what will happen next while knowing the characters are progressing.\
The animation is fine until fights start, when they move at a high speeds the animation gets quite annoying with faces and bodies getting distorted.\
It's a hard anime to follow but for some reason I stick with it and is probably my most followed animes as well as being one I know most about. I continue to watch for my liking of the minor characters and ninja fights.\

    Naruto\
1% action, 99% flashbacks\
I love this anime and yet I hate the anime. It’s all about ninjas. The ideas are great but the story isn’t told well. \
So Naruto has a demon sealed inside him. A demon with nine tails, it’s one of nine tailed demons from the One Tail to the Nine Tails.\
Because of this Naruto is hated by the villagers because this demon attacked their village a few years back. Naruto’s dream is to become leader of the village, the Hokage. This is the basic plot so far.\
Now my main problem with this anime is that it’s suppose to be an action anime\
          \
        but there isn’t that much action, just a bunch of talking, Naruto constantly makes a speech about how he wants to be Hokaga, Hokage, Hokage. When you think you’re gonna get a cool action sequence they interrupt it with a flashback. And they reuse the same flashbacks over and over and over…\
It’s like Dragonball Z, now this is an anime that I love and hate. DBZ’s problem is that they’re always standing around staring at each other, charging their power, etc. But DBZ is better, better action, more interesting villains, etc.\
You might enjoy this anime if you watch it online, but back then I didn’t have internet and was forced to watch 1 episode a week, so I didn’t have time to waste with flashbacks. \
Not much to say about Shippudden, Naruto hasn’t changed that much, he still uses the same techniques, the show got more serious but it’s still 1%action 99%flashbacks.\
My favorite characters are Mito Guy and Rock Lee, these are I think the only two who actually use martial arts whereas everybody else is using ninjutsu and genjutsu (“magic” techniques)",

    It's not bad. All the older otaku call it crap, the noobs praise it like a god, but it's just decent.\
Very good characterization, diverse to the point of being hard to keep up with though.\
Interesting story to back it up. A few cliches, but not to many.\
The only parts that I can really complain about are the dub and filler.\
A few of the voices(paticularly Naruto's) just make me clench my teeth.\
And the filler, THE F*%$ING FILLER! An episode or two in between arcs? Not bad, somtimes enjoyable. BUT 90+ EPISODES OF FILLER?!\

    naruto in its self was a good anime it had a solid storyline and great character development but i had to draw the line when they started getting into the filler series. this review will be put into 2 parts \
Story and Character \
Part 1: story\
ok well naruto starts off with a boy of the same name trying to become hokage ( you figure this out because he is saying this 500 times almost every sentence) and he does this by pulling pranks on the leaf village ( of course that will let you become there leader) after being caught he is tied up and\
          \
        sent to NINJA SCHOOL! of course little ninjas need to go to school to and then fails the test to become a ninja. he is convinced to steal a sacred scroll from the hokage by one of his teachers Mizuki ( who only appears in this episode as a villain) after some fights naruto uses shadow clones to beat up mizuki to the brink of friking death he then is told by iruka he past and is now a ninja.\
as i said before the story is solid but gets repetitive and stupid most of the time\
character \
in naruto they like to explain characters backstory through flash backs ( such as narutos and gaaras life) or sakuras friendship with ino  this gives you alot to go on with a character so you know what they went through when they were children the only problem i have is ulmost every main character has been abused in some way as a child.\
overal this anime gets an 8 for good storyline and good character developement\

    Basically, Naruto's about a kid who desires to be the best. He undercover a lot of pain, and finally makes some friends when he graduates from the academy. \
Story: (7/10)\
Not exactly the best story. There isn't much of a \"hook\", and it is only fairy enjoyable after the series is done introducing characters.\
Art: (6/10)\
Average art. Nothing else to really say.\
Sound: (7/10)\
There are some pretty good, suitable pieces of music for each scene. The problem however, is that they get TOO REPETITIVE after watching apparently 220 episodes... \
Character: (5/10)\
Don't get me started on this. Very casual characteres - Almost no creativity in this.\
Enjoyment: (9/10)\
This partly reminds\
          \
        me of Dragon Ball Z, which always hyped me up. It's one of those shows for \"kids\". You gotta love fighting. The comedy is pretty good as well, if your sense of humor is along the way with this series.\
Overall: (7/10)\
It's not an incredible anime, nor is it such a bad anime, it's slightly above average in my opinion.\

    There are so many good thins to say about Naruto and also a few bad things, but the biggest issue most people complain about, are the many filler episodes. To enjoy this great anime I recommend to skip these episodes, there are many sites that have a list of these episodes so it's easy to skip the fillers and to start enjoyimng the actual show. \
The story of Naruto is great, I love everything about the world the anime takes you in. The way they make you love the village and the ninjas in it, it's just amazing. The storyline has so many exciting things\
          \
        and unexpected twists. It didn't take me long to adjust to this show and love it.\
The art is good, but I've seen better. The characters look very unique but when it comes to quality it isn't outstanding. But I have to say that I have no problems with this. The fight scenes look good and almost each fight is memorable.\
The music in Naruto fits in every aspect. This is such an important feature in Naruto. It completes every scene in it. Almost every opening is an opening that you won't skip. The music is just great.\
The character diversity is another great thing about Naruto. You'll love so much characters as much as you love Naruto himself. Each and everyone has something unique and that's why you'll love them. A lot of character developement, very divers abilities, diffrent disigns. Konoha isn't the same if one of its ninjas wasn't there.\
This show is a must see, but I highly recommend that you skip the fillers, its much more fun that way. I don't think that anyone who has watched everything without fillers has regrets. A lot of people love it and there's a reason why! \

    I feel like both Naruto and Naruto Shippuden were significantly different. Naruto was about these kids living in a world of ninjas and their own takes on said world while Shippuden dedicates itself to \"Saving Sasuke\" and leaves everything else in the backseat. I'm not saying that his show doesn't have any flaws but it has less flaws than Shippuden. I'd saw it has two big flaws which is the fillers and the same old Jump series flaws. I didn't have the pleasure of watching this as a kid because in Puerto Rico most kids grew up watching either Dragonball Z, Pokemon or Yu Gi\
          \
        Oh but I'm pretty sure that if I watched this series as a kid, I would be a BIG fan. \
In conclusion: I recommend this series to anyone who loves fictional worlds or the ninja culture. I wouldn't recommend watching Shippuden though but you're still gonna have to watch it if you want to know what happens to the characters. My suggestion is to avoid the fillers as much as possible and don't be surprised if you get confused at times and see for yourself if it's good or not. \
 In short: My opinion about this anime is Naruto > Naruto Shippuden\

    I don't take into account filler episodes (let's pretend they don't exist and move on with our lives).\
TLDR: \
don't forget what you enjoyed as a kid, this was a good show.\
INTRO.\
With a show like this, people really like to pick it apart while dismissing some important factors. \
First and foremost, I would like to point out that this show was directed towards a young audience, so if you're watching this show as an adult or young adult, it most likely won't have it's desired effect, one needs to review this series with that in mind.\
To put it basically, the entire series is centred around a\
          \
        weak young boy who wants to rid himself of his weaknesses and be the strongest version of himself possible. This isn't a new concept for sure, I know it's the core of most Shonen's, however the way in which Naruto handles that concept is so kick-ass that it's almost impossible for most young audiences not to love it.\
MY PERSPECTIVE.\
I watched the first seasons of Naruto when I was 11 years old, I would like to say it has one of the strongest opening episodes of any series I've ever watched. What I will always remember is the kick-ass opening and ending themes, and the scene in the first episode where Naruto destroys some bad guy in the most overkill way possible that it was just so cool to watch.\
You might say the scenes are dragged out and the animation is inconsistent, but I never even remember any of that as a kid since I would be so encapsulated by the characters and waiting to see Naruto inevitably destroy one of them in his next fight.\
Seeing Naruto fight though his struggles is something you could say they overplay on, but again, when you're a kid things like sob stories and motivational stories go a long way and have a lot of repeat value. I would say they did it well, very well, and I was so drawn into Naruto's character every fight scene.\
You have to consider, if it had this effect on me, it would likely have had a very similar effect on a lot of people, especially if they watched it at the same age as I did. I can imagine if I watched the show for the first time now, I'd probably be thinking \"what the hell is all the fuss about\", just as so many other people have expressed on this website and so many other websites.\
RATING.\
For a show like this and for myself, it is hard to place an overall number out of 10. There are some scenes that I would rate 10/10 in terms of my own personal satisfaction, if I were to take a harsh critical judgement of the art, story and general production value (things I didnt care about when I was younger), sure, I wouldn't give it anything more than 6/10, overall I would personally give it 8/10.\
If you're any older than 14, I would recommend the manga.\

    Naruto was an appealing show to me as a kid. It was great to watch when I was 8 or so. Watching the whole show again felt so much slower in pace that what I experienced as a child. It was mediocre at best. I feel that the useless filler was what ruined it. Maybe it's that I watched too much shorter anime these days or that it was actually boring. I give it 6 because although it was so slow with storyline and useless filler, it was enjoying to experience the fight scenes. I seriously disliked the plot as it was just...boring. It could\
          \
        have been executed well if not for the \"major\" arcs being so damn long. It took about 10-20 episodes just to finish the first part. I guess some of the characters were enjoyable with their diverse and vibrant personalities, besides the most idiotic cliches in the main characters.\

    Story (Mediocre = 5)\
Character (Mediocre = 5)\
Enjoyment (Fair = 6)\
OK, for the Story, Character, and Enjoyment segment, I'll write it down together as one review because they're link closely to each other.\
- The titular character = Naruto has characters that are the most easy for us to fall in love with. He is cheerful and happy character, pure at heart because he's naive, too naive even, that he is very close to stupidity, but he has a very strong determination, values friendship and loyalty, and will do anything for friendship and loyalty.\
- PLUS, he has a very touching background that we want to shed our\
          \
        tears upon his lonely, sad, and hard past.\
- But that's not all, almost ALL of the characters inside this series are filled with background stories.\
- Some of them are sad and endearing background story, some of them provide a strong bond of friendship turned into rival, and some are spiced up with the little emotional background stories ingredient here and there, etc.\
- Naruto's character is lovable, and almost everybody has been provided with a deep background story, with a little bit of touchy ingredients here and there, so why only a mediocre score for characters and story?\
- Here's the explanation.\
- The main protagonist of this series suppose to be Naruto, Sakura, Sasuke, and Kakashi.\
- But Sakura rarely \"throw a punch\", and Sakura doesn't really have anything MAJOR role within the team. In other words, Sakura doesn't do much for and in the team. In other words, why should Sakura be the main protagonist if her role is really-really-really MINOR.\
- Meanwhile the other characters, although they are provided with a deep and touchy background stories, I could consider them as being \"too much to include many things\".\
- Why? Because the series put too much characters, but in the end, not all of them made a handfull of active role within the entire story.\
- The good example is Ten Ten. They are supposed to be the supporting characters, fine I get it, supporting characters doesn't supposed to have any heavy role in the series.\
- But again, just like Sakura, Ten Ten rarely \"throws a punch\", she rarely fight, she only involves actively in the \"Chunin Exam Arc\", and afterwards, she just appears as a very-very-very insignificant and minor role.\
- In other words, if Ten Ten is supposed to be that insignificant and very minor role, why should be a character named Ten Ten in the first place? Seriously, her purpose is nothing but an accessories and nothing more. And accessories doesn't really have any weight and depth to the entire series.\
- And Ten Ten is not the only one, we have  A LOT more of the other characters that also have insignificant, minor, not heavy, and not have any depth role.\
- That's why in the character department, the series put too much character that doesn't really need to be there because they do not have enough depth and weight in their role in the story.\
- Now the story and enjoyment, again, it drops to the mediocre and fair score.\
- The explanation is, eventhough the series provide a strong background to almost ALL of the characters, but they inserted the story in a very bad timing - which is during a fight.\
- The flow of the fight goes like this: fight - pause for a flashback to describe the background story - fight - pause to discuss technical analysis, and so on.\
- You see the flow, during the fight, our mood is \"Excitement\", but our \"Excitement\" is being thrown by a \"wet blanket\" because during the fight, there is this \"pause for a flashback to describe the background story\". It drops the mood-o'-meter greatly from the heights of \"Excitement\" into a flat or sad mood during the background story.\
- Not to mention about the \"pause to discuss technical analysis\" during the fight. That is also droping the mood-o'-meter just like the \"pause for a flashback to describe the background story\", with also the same explanation as described earlier.\
- Now then, not only those PAUSES destroy our mood-o'-meter, but it also damage the story pacing into a very sloooooooooooooow pace.\
- For example, Naruto and Sasuke's final battle consumes (I have counted the series) 8 episodes.\
- I said OMG! 8 episodes to wrap up a duel? what's making it so long? the answer is nothing less then the one I described earlier: \"fight - pause for a flashback to describe background story - fight - pause to discuss technical analysis\".\
- Not only that, as the story progressed, the fight lost its soul as a \"Ninja\".\
- Why? Because as the story progressed, it's getting more and more about \"fighting using magic\". It's getting less and less using a martial art ninja fighting, and it's using more and more magic and magic.\
- And with that trade off between Ninja martial arts fighting and magic, the series getting more and more lost its \"Ninja\" soul.\
- More negative part of the story is some part (even not the filler part) of the story doesn't really matter to the main chain of the story.\
- Many times there are episodes just to show what a goofball Naruto is. And that took 1 entire episode to show that? That's wasteful.\
- And some arc, like Naruto's team mission to escort that \"Marathon\" guy really isn't necessary. The weight of the story to the remaining arc and to the rest of the story chain doesn't really significant.\
- So insignificant that you won't miss a thing if you just SKIP the arc.\
- And that \"Marathon\" escort arc is just one of many stories that is insignificant, but waste of number of episodes in this series.\
- The other most wasteful insignificant story is the filler arc.\
- The filler arc, if I count the number of episodes, it consumes 86 episodes of filler.\
- Filler never have any significant weight to the main story chain, never did, never is, never will.\
- But wasting 86 episodes on something insignificant weight to the main story chain on filler is just plain wasteful.\
- The pacing of the story is incredibly sloooooooow, the mood-o'-meter drops from \"Excitement\" many times, and as the story progressed, the \"Ninja\" atmosphere begins to fade and fade, many wasteful episodes, even for the non-filler, I can not grade Naruto into a higher score than 5 and 6.\
- Because it is very mediocre and I think Naruto is far much too overrated and overhyped.\
Sound (Good = 7)\
- Sound is good, because much of the Opening and Ending theme are enthusiastic.\
- The BGM is also enthusiastic.\
- But then again, not all of them are match the mood of the scene, so I'll consider it good, but not \"very\" good.\
Art (Art = 6)\
- Well, it just plain descent graphic to me.\
So Overall = (5+6+7+5+6) : 5 = 6 (round up)\

    Okay, my first review! Well anyway lets get on with it.\
The first point i feel that i need to make is that, at first, most viewers will probably find Naruto highly annoying, irritating even, to the point where you actually begin to question just what the hell is good about the show. However soon you 'adapt' to Naruto and even begin to like him when he has moment in the spotlight during fight scenes where he actually is kind of cool, well as cool as someone can be in a bright orange jacket but anyway now that is out of the way i can move\
          \
        on to some of the other characters and story line.\
Some people may not be a fan of the story line and characters that make up Naruto but i for one do thoroughly enjoying the concepts behind most of the characters that make up this world, although i will admit, its very easy to bash the main Konoha 11, in fact as 'important' as they maybe - and are important to the story line due to the way it has been written to involve them (obviously) i still feel that the Konoha 11 really didn't need to be there and that the story could of went along perfectly fine with just team 7 due to the lack of impact the other characters seem to have on the show.\
While the Konoha 11 are generally likable, Shikamaru is a personal favorite, there are members such as Shino and TenTen who really dont seem to do much, ever. \
Moving on to some of the other characters excluding them, and are no doubt more important in my case there are characters within Naruto that are seriously easy to become attached to, so when something major impacts said character it really hits home to the viewers.\
Personally, although the storyline gets bashed within Naruto, and i wont mention why due to spoilers, i feel that if the fillers where cut out (the reason of why the enjoyment is so low) this would be a solid anime, although a simple solution would be to read the manga, some would argue that its not the same experience.\
In terms of art i had to lower it due to some episodes really letting the side down, and i mean looking rather horrible for a high budget anime ( i presume it's high budget don't quote me on that) although the overall style of the art used within Naruto i do enjoy, so i didn't grade this too harshly.\
The soundtrack used within Naruto i have to say is fantastic, added to some of the sadder scenes the tracks really pack a punch to the feels, and there are also a lot of soundtracks that really go nice with the battles, not to mention the great intro and outro selection, a 10 from me.  \
Overall i'd say give Naruto a chance, if you understandably don't want to set off on a marathon of an anime riddled with fillers then i would definitely recommend you check out the manga, however seeing the battles animated, the soundtrack adding to important moments of the story and the powerful voice acting really makes this a whole lot more enjoyable.\

    Before I have seen Naruto, I have watched a couple of anime back then and nothing really caught my attention unlike this one. What is intriguing about this one is that they used a clever trick to keep your mind wondering what will happen next. But what makes this show special is the lessons and philosophies in life were scaled down where little kids would get attracted to and first time anime watchers as well. After years of putting smiles, tears and hope for children, the show went on and aimed for those same children who are now more mature and thus, Naruto Shippuden was\
          \
        born – a show that is also more mature and, actually, better than the first one. It is highly recommended for you to see this first before going onto Shippuden although some of you may think that it is a pain to watch all 220 episodes just to see Shippuden.\
Story (7/10)\
The story is quite unique in a way – it was set in an entirely different world which, at the same time, resembles real life situations such as wars, laws, conflicts, vengeance, hatred, loyalty, patriotism, and friendship. Although some may say it may resemble other anime, but the setting and the situation of this one is quite different, being in a world of ninjas and all. As mentioned earlier, they ingeniously designed each episode to make your mind wonder what will happen next whereas in psychology, they will feed you what you desire and before you become fully satisfied, they will take it away from you so that you will want to see what will happen in the next episode.\
Art (8/10)\
Art varies from artist to artist. An artist who is more into dark and morbid things might find the art, as for I, quite so so and vice versa. Although I must admit that they made the character designs quite unique and memorable. They also did a good job making the main protagonist unique by drawing whiskers on his face, although some of you may wonder as to why he has whiskers so try to read the first Naruto published in One Shot.\
Sound (8/10)\
They did a good job in matching the emotions in every scene with the music and in every fight scene, you would have this epic feeling, trying to wonder who will win the battle. \
Character (9/10)\
Every character has their own unique personality, philosophy and way of living. There are the annoying types who you wish would just die already, those who are strange, over the top, hardworking and over dramatic types of ninjas, the mysterious genius type, a hyperactive knuckle head ninja and so on.\
As time change, people also change along with it; as the series progress, the characters also progress and change. In the end, you will find the characters entirely different from how they were when the series had started. \
Enjoyment (9/10)\
Although there are so many fillers in this show although it was quite enjoyable. The fillers were so so, but it is amazing and quite the experience. Sometimes you will find yourself making the same hand signs and mimicking the characters. In other words, you will find yourself trying to become one of them, a ninja.   ",

Character,this anime has an nice number of characters from Genin to ANBU,theyr art is awsome,individual storys are cool.\
Enjoyment,it vas an good anime but i kinda didnt have a big naruto fan inside me and im not one now,but i liked this anime mostly becouse of the music but the plot is cool.\
Overall,the anime has an great plot,nice art,awsome music,nice number of characters,so this is an realy nice anime.You say anime to someone (a non anime lover) the first thing that comes to his mind is Naruto.This anime everyone knows and watched it as a kid or as an teen.\

    This is anime is a masterpiece. TO ME, is the best anime that was ever made. I don't like to compare with other animes because it's useless. The story since the very first episode that I saw in 2006 seems like i didn't forget so in this point of all animes i've watched, Naruto is the best character of all animes i ever watched.\
What really count on here is the history, there is a motive to like Naruto. He has a history, Sakura has a history, Sasuke has a history, Kakashi has a history so, putting all together we'll able to see that physical force\
          \
        or super-powers are nothin' compare to things they passed and what they're doing to overcome it. Putting the animation, the soundtrack (is amazing, just search on youtube and you will see), the enjoyment is impeccable.\
The fillers are bad because are fillers, but even the fillers has a history with beginning, middle and end, it some famous animes are trying to put a history on them best episodes and are failing. About history, Masashi has a lot of things to teach to other mangakas.\
But at the end of day, it still be my favorite anime of all animes i ever watched and i really recommend!\

    Most people stop watching this anime in favor of Naruto: Shippuden, and I could see why. There are dozens of episodes of filler. For most of the series, the story is great. The character development is worthy of praise, and also.... NINJAS. However, this series does have its cons, beside the aforementioned filler. Pretty much everything in this anime is recycled to use over and over again. The story, the music, the scenery, etc. However, if you are willing to put up with all of that (like I was), then you will enjoy watching this series until it ends. \

Naruto is a good anime with a lot of actions, comedy and fillers. \
Story:  Naruto had a one hell of a childhood he was alone the whole time he  had no friends, family or anything, but one day when he joined a team everything change. Naruto is in a group and they are gonna do some dangerous missions to not so tough missions. Naruto and his team will have a very difficult journey a head, a lot of dangerous enemies, competisions and breathtaking battles. \
Art. To be honest the art sucks in the start, but gets better, it’s similar art like Bleach, One\
          \
        Piece etc. Other than that it’s OK!\
Characters:\
They are so unlike  these characters, a stubborn one, one seeking for revenge etc.. \
Naruto is a very social boy with a lot of energy, he is obsessed to be the hokage one day and he likes ramen..  \
Sasuke is the cool guy in this anime, the girls are just lovin’ him, he don’t care because he has some other thoughts in his mind..\
Sakura is a cheerfullgirl with a lot of competive instncts and a bad inner self. \
Kakashi the most chilled ninja in Konoha. Kakashi loves to read one certain book series called Icha-Icha or make out series.\
Sound:\
Naruto has one of the rocked anime opening that I  likes plus I love the sad OST, the ending is nothing out of the other world, but it’s ok. \
Enjoyment: This anime has it’s good and bad momements, but i enjoyed it.\
Overall: Naruto is a okay anime to watch, but you’ll get a bit frustrated about the fillers. If you like good figts and can endure the fillers Naruto is something for you!",

The main character is a loudmouth and I thought ninjas were supposed to be cool, not stupid 11 year old boys who make more noise than anything. The art is fine except the noses.

    Great. Although this is for kids actually, teens can totally relate to it. But I was a bit disappointed with the character output. The personality of the characters were a bit edgy, especially Haruno Sakura. I don't think her personality suits her. She's too brutal on Naruto, and a bit fake on others, especially Sasuke. \
But despite this flaw, Naruto is one of the must-see anime titles for everyone. Trust me, it's one of those you'll remember for a long, long time.\

I feel all the things that the characters are going through. It's about friendship,family,pride of where you come from. This show makes me laugh,makes me cry, I've even yelled at my computer screen when things happen I don't like. lol. I never came across any show like Naruto that had me fall completely in love with it. I do admit when I heard of this show I thought it was just for kids. That\
          \
        it was going to be this lame kid show. Boy was I wrong! My sister actually got me into anime and introduced me to Naruto. I'm so glad she did! I thank her like everyday. I love everything about Naruto. The storyline,the characters,music,animation. EVERYTHING!!. Naruto is always in my heart. Hands down the best anime! This is my opinion though. People have others that they love more or what they think is the best ever. I've told some other anime fans that Naruto was my most fav and they would laugh. Doesn't bother me any because it's what I like not what they like. \

To all of the people that have been hounding about how Naruto is so very mainstream , well maybe you should remember the reason why it is in the first place? \
The character is an underdog a true underdog with no chance at all in the beginning of the anime and we all know that. But the story is more about how each character has developed not only physically but emotionally and mentally as well. Sure Naruto has its cliches, but guess what?  So does so many other animes out\
          \
        there. Its okay if it has some cliches, cause the plot and character development and excellent , but to say that Naruto is okay or just good really doesn't say much if you have been watching it for as many years as I have. The fillers are ridiculous, yes we all know and it pisses so many of us off, but the completely discredit the work and thought that was put into each character (except TenTen, Shino and Iruka) is dissapointing. If I could give Naruto an 8.7 I would cause I know thats a fair score.\

    Okay Okay Okay.\
Naruto is a great series to watch... If you have no job and have a few spare hours to fill.\
It has enough to be mildly entertaining.\
I have a few annoyances with this series though.\
Characters:\
Usually naruto and sakura; They both tend to do things in the middle of a fight that make you want to cringe at.\
Sakura just sits in fear, hardly has a decent fight scene. Is really boring to watch. HELL!! It annoys me when she constantly bags Naruto for being useless and you feel like screaming \"WELL WHY DONT YOU GET OFF YOUR ASS THEN SAKURA!!\"\
Naruto: I enjoy humour, but this\
          \
        kids a little brat. He just complains and gets in the way all the time. Its like that annoying smelly 5yro cousin the constantly gets his face in the way when you are ready a book. Or who sits and asks a million questions when you are playing video games... annoying is an understatement. \
Also, when it comes to the fight scenes. I get extremely annoyed at sequences where the main hero powers up to his highest levels AND STILL GETS THE SHIT KICKED OUT OF THEM! You get all excited, only to be very disappointed. I might add Dragonball Z has this problem time and time again.\
Plus the fight plots arent very creative. it starts off easy, then the enemy has hidden potential. someone comes in and saves the day.... BEARLY!! \
There arent any moments when you are proud of the characters triumphs. By the time it ends you are left thinking \"well its about time!\"\
Also, I dislike the lack of variety in the fighting. They seem to forever repeat the same attack again and again. No new moves. No combos. Nothing that makes the next boss fight amazing!\
Coming back to things characters do that are just flatout stupid. You think \"that was obvious!! how did you not notice! you are a freaking ninja!!!\" Im not saying they need to be godly powerful, but its not clever stuff that gets them.\
ALSO IM SICK OF THE REPLACEMENT JUTSU! the one where they trap the guy and they turn out to be a log or something. WAY WAY OVER USED!!!\
I might just add, that Gurren Lagaan has none of this and is still amazing. The fighting is impressive and gets.to.the.point. when they power up, you know its gunna get brutal! and it does!\
Even when Rock Lee uses his 'Forbidden' jutsu, its amazing!!! But it doesnt even amount to the finishing move. He still loses and it kinda feels like it was pointless to even try.\
I like my Movies, anime etc to get to the point and stay on track.\
Like Dragon Ball; naruto is fine to watch with a spare moment. But its so repetative in ideas, it feels like \"same shit different story\"\
THE END\

    I was in 10th grade when I saw my first five minutes of Naruto, I promptly shut off the TV and went on with my daily life.  However, over the years, I began to want to know what the story was about, so I picked up the manga.  From reading the manga, I learned the best way to enjoy Naruto is in sections.  The minute it started to annoy me, I put it down and read something else.  The same applies to the anime.  It's just to big to fully enjoy it in one go and eventually the story will\
          \
        grate on you.\
Story:  The story is pretty good.  It follows the plot of the manga really well.  I even enjoyed some of the filler arcs.  What they brought to the table as far as expanding on manga plot, was really interesting.  What lacked though was they tended to repeat the same plot line in the fillers, which got to be annoying.\
Art:  The art was fair.  It was nice to see the village and characters in color, but the animation tended to be lazy.  For manga plots, episodes seemed to go on and on and showed repeated animation.  For example, how many scenes do we need of Kiba floating down a river holding a branch over his head?  One or two would suffice, but I lost count at five because of how ridiculous it was getting.\
Sound:  The sound was very good.  I loved the soundtrack to the show.  The music never failed to hype me up and it made me shed a few tears during emotional moments.  As a lover of music, it really makes or breaks a show for me as far as emotional connection goes.\
Character:  They did a good job with the manga characters, however, the same does not apply to the filler characters.  They were so forgettable, I would forget there names right after there arc would end.  They also didn't have personality.  The only filler character I remotely cared about was Isaribi, who I had to look up to even remember her name.  They also all tended to act the same in every arc.\
Enjoyment:  The series was enjoyable.  I looked forward to every box set I got in the mail.  When it got to be annoying, I would shut it off for a few weeks until I gained interest again.\
Overall:  The series was fair.  It had it's flaws and sometimes I asked myself if this was the same series I started off watching, but I would stop watching it for a few weeks and I would come back to it refreshed.  To watch Naruto, you have to have an open mind and willpower to deal with the mass amount of filler.  And you have to understand that if it is not for you, then it is not for you.\

    Naruto is about the main character Naruto whose name is the same as the series. He has a past that he knows nothing about, that the fourth Hokage sealed the nine-tailed beast within him, because of that the villagers don`t acknowledged him as a part of the village and ignore him. Because of this he does a lot of pranks to get attention. But in secret he train alot to become strong so they wiil acknowledge him, and one day become Hokage which is his dream. The road Naruto walks on is tough and difficult but he never give up and always go with his\
          \
        ninja way. How he comes over all the obstacles in his path and becomes stronger against all odds is amazing and awesome. Naruto grows stronger and form bonds with others and becomes friends with alot of people, he masters knew moves and techniques from various people and get to know them better. Naruto is my absolutely favourite anime in the world because the character Naruto is much cooler than he looks, the story is well-formed and it gives a whole new feeling about ninjas and their fighting style.\

    not the best anime, i think shippuden is waaaay better. i used to watch this show on toonami when it was first being dubbed, and i enjoyed it when i was younger. i agree that it's way over hyped, i wouldn't have began watching the hole series again unless i started getting into shippuden first. the only parts i really liked in this series were the fights, it's kind of sad that half of the episodes are fillers because the actual show is decent.\

    Naruto... You know, I'm probably very behind-the-times in reviewing this show, but because I like doing this AND in honour of getting to the halfway point in the original show (110/220), I'mma gonna do this. Let's jam suzies:\
General comments: What more can be said about this show man! Love him, hate him, best show ever, worst show ever, you can't deny the impact of this show. In fact, it would probably be the dragonball of this word had dragonball not been created. (Or One Piece...) Why does it work? Ninjas. EVERYONE knows you either fall on the pirate side or the ninja side. After dabbling\
          \
        in AC4, I'd have to go pirates, BUT - Hidden Villages. Ninja techniques. High-octane martial arts action. Gravity-defying jumps and aerobics. Just, NINJAS.\
Art: I like the art. Despite being a \"new\" show, it's ALL hand-drawn, and reflects the manga of which the show is based on very well.  What more can you say, very traditional and timeless.\
Sound: I actually didn't like the sound that much. Repititive yet unmemorable. Who knows, everyone is different, but the opening and ending changed every 20 or so episodes, and there was, like, little jingles when the mundane things came on where... Filler really, no important dialogue etc.\
Character: Oh GOD. SO MANY. I'll do a brief bio of the main people.\
Naruto: I can't believe, to this day, Naruto is the only shoujin main character who I actually really like! He's comical... In fact, funnily enough, he IS the comic relief character, but also the main guy. He's actually got the spirit of the nine-tails fox sealed inside him (ACTUAL Japanese folklore) , and, dunno, just awesome!\
Sakura is Naruto's love interest, despite being in love with Sasuke (who I'll get too in a bit.) Oh, did I mention everyone is, like, 14?! Just throwing it out there. Unfortunately, Sakura fills the usual woman role. Apart from she's 10x more boring. Just, come on, make her do something otger than cook, heal and be a love interest! A story arc of herself would be awesome! Sasuke: Sasuke makes up the rag-tag team as the arrogant yet cool kid that everyone wanted to be at school. He gets pretty interesting around 30/40's episodes in, we learn about him, and he gets bit by the main baddy that essentially gives him this \"disease\" that allows him to go berserk, adding to his impressive ninja skills. Despite being arrogant and \"that knob\", I liked Sasuke!\
Kakashi: Kakashi rounds this all off, as he is the teacher of the \"squad\" of Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke. He's like the teacher everyone wanted. He's so layed back (he reads while just casually hanging, from his feet, off a tree) and is both cool and cool-headed. He also has the Sharingan ability, as does Sasuke, which allows them both to essentially predict a future move and act accordingly. Kakashi is my favourite character. \
Lee: Lee's special in that he can't concentrate his Chakra (ninja-power in essence) and so has to rely on martial arts. Because of this, however, many people IWIH ninja techniques can't touch him. He's fast, but strong. He's the character that shows *caring voice* everyone can achieve if they try! Excuse me while I go through up...\
Shikamaru, Chouji and Ino essentially make up the \"neo-Naruto\" squad, Ino = Sakura, Shikamaru = Sasuke, and Chouji is just the fat kid. So in no way similar to Naruto, still... They're both wierd/odd? The Sound ninjas are the enemy village of Narutos village, and Orochimaru is essentially you're main baddie. If I've missed out so many, fan favourites even, but there's just TOO many characters. Many do just have a side-role anyway.\
Verdict: So yeah, I bloody liked this show! Well, still do. It's basically mindless ninja fun (though, it's ninjas, so not completeley mindless) and just high-octane stuff. Really, if you haven't checked it out, why?! Where have you been? But, seriously, do - unfortunately, Naruto is like marmite, splits opinion, but if you love it, you're in for one hell of a ride. Just don't start Shippuden. It's like looking at a mirror through a mirror haha...\

    Es una serie de aventuras ninja con muchos combates y una historia algo comun, al menos eso parece al princio con todo el rollo de los torneos y eso. Sin embargo goza de una gran cantidad de personajes perfectamente definidos, cada uno con un encanto especial y que interaccionan muy bien. La historia es sumamente dinamica y entretenida, pueden disfrutarse varios episodios seguidos sin problema, es mas, el problema sera dejar de ver la serie jeje. En mi opinion, es una de las pocas series que de verdad logra integrar una gran cantidad de personajes sin que se sienta forzada o manipulada la historia, cada\
          \
        personaje tiene su lugar y momento de importancia. Hay escenas dramaticas, de mucha accion y algunas que hasta hacen llorar. Una de las mejores series, yo no diria que la mejor, pero si de las infantables en toda coleccion anime. Para usuarios nuevos es recomendable ver al menos 3 o 4 episodios para agarrarle el gusto e ir comprendiendo la trama, que en apariencia no es complicada, pero si que engancha con el tiempo. Tiene un cierto parecido a yuyu hakusho o dragon ball, al final de cuentas es un shonen de batallas, pero a diferencia de estas, como ya dije, goza de mucha variedad de personajes que interactuan perfecto, seguro encontraras a tu favorito muy pronto. Recomiendo verla, es una de esas series imperdibles.   \

     A fantastic anime to watch. The story is strong and pulls you in, and makes you laugh along with all the action. Lots and lots of filler episodes though, which at times can be a little annoying, but its worth it. Almost anyone can find a character to relate to, or fall in love with. People go pretty crazy over the anime, its not the best in the history of its genre or anything, but it is worth watching =D\

    Everybody likes ninjas, everybody likes orange jumpsuits. Therefore, everybody likes Naruto. I think that's how it goes but I've heard some other stuff too. Naruto for me was one of my favorites when I was in middle school and high school. It was also the favorite of many of my friends.\
I enjoyed most of Naruto except for the terrible fillers.\
Story- Generic shonen stuff. Main character wants to be the best of the best and will strive until he is the best of the best. \
Art- Gets better.\
Sound- Yes\
Character- No comments\

    Naruto is one of those anime that anyone with whatever taste in anime can enjoy.Naruto is about a boy named Naruto who wants to become the next Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village.He has along way to go before he gets there.Naruto goes on missions with his teammates,Sasuke[Naruto's rival],Sakura[love triangle between them],and Kakashi[the sensei].Naruto and his team complete mission according to their rank.The show usually likes to start with small missions before they get into a long episode arc.There are plenty of anime were this more over 30+ characters and you probably can't name them all,well this isn't the chase in Naruto.There so many characters\
          \
        and they are very recognizable because they all have different personalities.You also get to see some of them fight against each other and get to know more about them like when Hinata and Neji fight.Most of the others develop much better in Naruto Shippuden.In most of the episodes the Naruto and Sasuke rivalry,it starts with just name calling to finally fighting each other.Another thing about Naruto is that even some of the villains are likeable like Itachi.The fights are a great thing about this too.Not only do they use Ninjutsu,Taijutsu,and Genjutsu,they also have their own little unique power depending on what clan in the village their are from.I can truly see why this anime has plenty of world wide sucsess.\

    Meh... I am not the hugest fan of Naruto. But let me make it clear, I am not trying to be the enemy here. NARUTO IS NOT BAD ANIME. \
So let me start off with the good. I really did enjoy Naruto for the character development, you can really see Naruto gets more mature as it progresses (Not talking about Shippuden). Its also really fascinating to see all the new Jutsu that Naruto starts learning and he also learns to walk on water. But also like every anime he has a goal, to become Hokage. The anime is really amusing and it can get really\
          \
        intense and some points, not a lot of emotional parts though which is a shame.\
Now the bad part about the review. \
Naruto gets super repetitive. The story starts off like \"i want to become the hokage\" and they start doing missions which dont help in becoming Hokage at all. Also Naruto gets really off track when something happens to Sasuke. \
The other thing is the english dub voice acting, it sounds like Naruto smokes like 10 packs of cigs a day\
In conclusion, i don't hate Naruto. I sincerely don't. But Naruto is extremely overrated, but i still think you should watch it because its not necessarily a \"bad\" anime but just a little repetitive. Also FILLERS EVERYWHERE! ",

    Review 6: Naruto (Favourite hero of all time)???\
now if you haven't ever seen or watched naruto, then ur crazy..... and if you haven't even heard of Naruto....then where the hell have you been all of your life!!!! Nearly every anime fan as watched or has been reading naruto and if you haven't and you love manga or anime then you truely do not deserve the title Super Fans or Fanettes!!!!!!! if you haven't heard of Naruto then i do sort of feel sorry for you in a way, since nearly everyone has at least been reading or has read the naruto series.\
i don't want to\
          \
        ruin it for nearly everyone who actually reads this review but it is an amazing series that everyone should check out, it doesn't matter if you read the series or watch the series it really is worth your time and will stay with you for the rest of your life.\
obviously naruto is the main character through out the series, he lives in a small village with plenty of other ninjas that are his age and there are plenty more kids you'll meet on the way to discovering who naruto actually is and what can make him so powerfull yet so stupid at times.\
Naruto: obviously the main character in the series. he's a young, active and slightly weird boy who loves being a ninja even though he isn't very good at it..... He's crazy even from the beginning of the book when as soon as you go onto the first page he's dangling from a rope painting on the hokage (s) stautes faces, he does get caught and then you can see how weird he actually is. Most of the teachers get extremely annoyed with him no matter what he does, he annoys a lot of people in his classes and is jealous of the strongest and most good looking boy there is named Susuke. He hates him and never gets a long with him, apart from that Naruto can be an annoying boy in the series but as time passes you grow to love him even more! he can be really strong and quick witted at times, like when ever he's in a fight. you'll grow to love him as time passes on.\
Sasuke: A mysterious young boy who's about the same age as Naruto, every girl in the school loves him and has an extreme crush on him, he isn't really bothered about all of the girls though he and he doesn't seem to act really cool he just is cool.....naturally!!!!! every time he walks in to the class room all of the girls stare and it falls quiet. Naruto hates his guts because he gets all of the attention off of the girls, Sasuke hates him aswell which must be natural aswell. At the start you'll love him but as the series progresses then your opinions on him may change slightly.\
Sakura: Sakura is a young girl about the same age as Sasuke and Naruto, the only difference inbetween Sakura and the other two is the fact that she is mature enough to understand that not everyone has to be rivals in life, she loves almost everything and has the biggest crush on Sasuke ever, but Sasuke captures all of the girls hearts so he doesn't really notice if there is one person stands out more than the others. She has a rivalry with an old freind that you'll meet later on in the series. She doesn't have a mysterious past at all, but when she was younger she did get bullied a lot for having a high forehead which made her stand out a little bit more then everyone else. she's an average character who i think everyone will love from the start.\
if you live in england then you might know that there is a magazine called NEO which comes out every month and if you read that then you should now how many films there are on the naruto series, how popular it is, the fact that there are loads of videogames on the series and that naruto has to be in the magazine every month to new releases and new books coming out.\
the series is on going and amazing even though it is long. if i was one of you guys and i was reading this i would check it out straight away it really is worth the time and you will enjoy it. i would recommend this to everyone!!!!!!!!!!! of all ages!!!!!!!!!!!!!\

    Hey, I started watching this anime quite a bit later than I think most people. I started on Naruto ship, and then realised that there was a series before that. And so I stared to watch and fell instantly in love with it. The characters all have there own unique personalities. Which makes for a more interesting watch. Also I like the fact that in some parts Naruto can be really derpy and funny and then become quite serious at the same time depending on the circumstance. \
Also this anime does start to show what friendship and loyalty to people can really mean. E.g Naruto\
          \
        fighting to protect his friends, and going to help out some the sand ninjas because they did too. Which I feel shows that if you value your friends they will help out.\
This anime also has some really good morale messages and also how peoples dreams are important to them. And how they will do anything to try and protect them. And he would even put his body on the line for them.\
So I feel overall that it is a really good anime which I really enjoyed. I hope you found this review helpful and enjoyable\

    Naruto is one of those animes that everyone has heard about even if you've never watched anime in your life. It's also one of the animes that has ASTOUNDING amounts of potential with the concept. However, the story itself falls far short of what it could be sadly. The fact that this anime is 220 episodes with a sequel anime that has 300+ episodes or something is pretty much the reasoning behind that: They milked this WAY too hard.\
There are a lot of truly good moments for this anime, but after Sasuke escapes the leaf village, things start going downhill. It's been a while since\
          \
        I watched Naruto, but I can hardly even remember most of the stuff after that other than the Isarabi(Spelling) arc thing where they meet the fish girl and save her from the evil group/the villagers who hate her, mainly because that was the ONLY good filler arc I found. \
What's worse: The fillers don't matter in shippuden at all. It's over 100 episodes of pointless fluff.\
That being said, the story could be improved even without the fillers: The potential is there for this to be a giant success, but they limited themselves in the story department to make way for action scenes and a bunch of fighting.\
The character development is good, but can be improved on. A lot of characters are flat out predictable whether you like them or not, and interactions can be cheesy due to the attempted comedy where it didn't need to be.\
For new anime watchers I would recommend watching Naruto or at least trying it out: It truly is a decent anime, but it could've been a lot better than it is.\

    Naruto is another in a long-line of popular shounen battle anime in its focus on the titular, simple-minded and obnoxious titular character desiring to become his village's leader through hard work and perseverance despite being a societal outcast because of being the human host for a demonic fox. Essentially, whatever typical shounen action anime tropes you can think of apply to much of what Naruto has to offer up from the titular character being a worst case of the simple-minded hero character than Dragon Ball's Goku, Sasuke being the revenge-seeking loner, Sakura the short-fused kunoichi with a single-minded interest in Sasuke, powerful sage Jiraiya being\
          \
        yet another dirty old man, and so forth. It also has some of the typical battle arc tropes of the genre such as Naruto and others seeking to grow stronger, a battle tournament, and a main villain attempting to wipe out the heroes throughout a good span of the series.\
The series does make its attempts at offering depth to its story and characters. It explores a number of the consequences that the ninja lifestyle has with affecting a number of characters that include the mental toll being a demonic host takes on Gaara and Orochimaru's quest for seeking knowledge on all ninja techniques leading him to continually manipulate others in his schemes. The development of Sasuke's character also leads to what is considered one of the franchise's best arcs with the Sasuke Retrieval arc when the orphaned Uchiha takes on his own plans to seek the revenge he wants. These more serious developments do lead to the mentioned obnoxious traits of the characters to be dialed back a bit as the series progresses, which leads it to actually be a little more engrossing as a result.\
Unfortunately like many titles of its ilk, Naruto does eventually find itself getting into filler arcs because of catching up with its manga source material. This especially gets bad after the end of the Sasuke Retrieval arc when the remaining 85 episodes of the series consist of nothing but filler thus leading the advancing plot to be dragged to an abrupt halt and be left incomplete until Naruto Shippuuden comes along. The fillers do make attempts at trying to develop some characters who otherwise didn't get much exposure in the series proper, some of this working well with Sakura and Hinata. But for the most part, the fillers are otherwise non-essential viewing thanks to their self-contained and anime-exclusive developments, and you could just as easily skip past them if you only wanted to watch the series up to the Sasuke Retrieval arc.\
In terms of artwork, scenery and character designs are reasonably detailed and well drawn though nothing out-of-the-ordinary for a 2000s anime. It makes use of a good number of animation shortcuts thanks to its long length, but has its occasional fluid movements in some of the anime's pivotal fights that include the climactic fight between Naruto and Sasuke during the Retrieval arc. Opening and ending musical tracks mostly milk use of J-rock and J-pop tracks, but the insert tracks consist of some catchy traditional beats with the use of drums, chanting, and instrumentation.\
While having its occasional moments of quality, Naruto still does ultimately suffer from a number of the typical pitfalls of the shounen action anime genre from its rehashing of the typical character and storyline elements of the genre, frequent use of animation shortcuts, and having a good helping of filler arcs. I would only recommend this title if you are a big fan of similar long-running shounen action titles like DBZ or Bleach. \

É o seguinte, Naruto é bom, mas nada que se possa comparar com One Piece ou DBZ. Lembrando que não estou falando do Shippuden, e sim do Original. As OSTs de Naruto são incríveis, as melhores que eu já vi, mas existem muitos pontos negativos, e um deles, com certeza são os fillers demasiados.\
O clímax de Naruto pra mim, foi o Chuunin Shiken, e depois disso, nada mais valeu a pena ver até a luta Naruto x Sasuke.\
E um dos melhores personagens, o Gaara, acaba perdendo o brilho mais no fim do anime.\
Mas fora isso, é ótimo, Naruto é um anime que todo\
          \
        otaku deveria assistir. OSTs ótimas, lutas interessantes, histórias bem elaboradas (apesar de não chegarem nem perto de OP) e personagens carismáticos.\

    Naruto, to this day, remains one of my favorite anime is the anime that really started my love for the Japanese culture as a whole. It is sentimentally the number one anime in my own view. I wouldn't mind watching any one of the episodes in my free time if the chance came. It is a wonderful show with characters that truly touch your heart and know how to put a permanent place in your life. My only complaint is the excessive amount of fillers that are throughout this anime, mainly after Sasuke's depart from the spotlight. The amount of episodes afterward was definitely unnecessary\

    A good story with a diverse cast of characters that is plagued by the constant need for recaps, flashbacks and all sorts of unnecessary fillers.  \
First the negatives, the end of the first Naruto series are all fillers and honestly unnecessary to watch (they are ok, however not necessary to understand the larger story).  There are also a few fillers within the other episodes, however none of them are as bad as the end of the series.  These fillers begin when Naruto leaves to train.  This series has a tendency to waste time by telling, retelling, flashback and all sorts of\
          \
        tricks to go over the same plot point over and over again.  At one point an event happened, moments later they talked about that event, then they had a flashback to that event, then the talked about it again.  Later on in the same episode, they had a full recap of that event and flashed back to it again.  The sad thing is that event wasn't even that big of a deal.  This was the worse case I came across, however it still demonstrates the point that this show likes to waste time.  The characters are often hit or miss depending on the viewer, I personally could not stand Sasuke (the second main character).  I have heard a lot of people hate the main character, however the upside is there is a wide variety of characters and Im sure you will like somebody.\
The positive, the story is full of interesting characters that are intertwined with one another.  Unfortunately the majority of these relationships are not fully explained until the sequel of this series.  Even though most of these relationships are not fully explored, this series still does a great job of introducing you to the characters, their background and who they are in the larger scheme of things.  The action is creative and fun to watch.  One of the best parts is when a new character is introduced, they almost always have some sort of \"speciality\" or ability that makes them uniquely different from the rest of the cast.  Watching them fight and seeing their different abilities is always entertaining, especially when their ability somehow correlates with their story.  This series has some great villains and a well developed story for most of them.  There is a high degree of lineage to the story as a whole, and that just continues to grow as the show progress.  This is a great quality because almost everything that happens during the present, has some roots to the pass and in some cases, directly affect the near future.\
As a whole this story has great characters, a well developed storyline and entertaining action sequences that ultimately exemplify the key characteristics of the individuals within that fight.  However for all of the great qualities this show has, it also has the tendency of watering down the experience by revisiting the exact same scene over and over again.\
I recommend this to anyone who has the ability to put up with fillers in the form of episodes, as well as constant time wasters such as flashbacks.  To anyone who can put up with the insane amount of fillers, they will get to experience a fun and vast storyline filled with a great cast of characters.\

    Story:\
Naruto is about ninjas. It has alot to do with power and obtaining power and such. The villians are people that try to obtain power that they shouldn't have. I love the story of Naruto actually, mainly the pacing at which it develops. Everything is rather slow and expanded which somewhat makes it boring yet at the same time it keeps your attention. A bit like death note, where they make small things seem very significant and go into a ton of details that you supposedly shouldn't care about yet you get into it. The whole purpose of writing this review is to let people\
          \
        know they should watch this, and that Shippuden is soooo much worse. The pacing of Shippuden is done somewhat like Naruto, but they clearly try too hard to make you care, too many characters that later become unimportant. It's hard to pinpoint what exactly, but the main thing is that they try too hard to be like original Naruto, go overboard, and end up boring. I give the story an 8/10 only because sometimes it develops a bit tooo slowly, and 70+ filler episodes isn't exactly my favorite thing, especially since I didn't even realize they were all filler until the end....\
Art:\
Nothing to talk about. Creative but not beautiful or genius design. They try to make each character different and succeed without seeming too generic. SHIPPUDEN ON THE OTHER HAND, while they succeed in making characters different, some of them are just plain silly. Sometimes the slightly generic quality allows the character to seem normal, but in shippuden characters like killer bee and his annoying rhymes, pain and all those piercings.....you just can't imagine them being in the normal Naruto, right? So in a way, while they are more creative, they don't fit the boundaries of creative and end up unusual, and also take away the character of the show. \
Excluding characters, the backgrounds have become extremely lazy, and Naruto also doesn't look badass anymore.\
I give the art an 8/10, because there's nothing particularly great or bad in it, but Shippuden is a huge downgrade, and alot of their \"creativity\" just leads to the show being out of character from the original.\
Sound:\
Soundtracks are always awesome, both Original and Shippuden. I like quite a few of the openings. 8/10\
Character:\
It ends up being like a typical anime, where you like the protaganists and dislike the villians. Like I said above, characters are all creative and different but sometimes try a little too hard to do so. I however, think Naruto is totally awesome in the original. Even with his annoying and \"knucklehead\"-ness it's kind of hard to not like him, especially because of the way they make all his enemies seem like heartless douchebags. SHIPPUDEN ON THE OTHER HAND, turns even the 9-tailed fox into a kids show character(though I suppose it is a kid's show). They (unforgivably), suddenly turn Naruto into the strongest Ninja ever, first making him a rather normal/strong ninja due to tons of training, and then adding on weird powers like sage mode and bijuu mode or something. Maybe if they added less crazy, new level-up-like, abilities and just focused on making him more special instead of all those rasengans you'd like him a bit more. And everytime they focus on sasuke they just make him out to be more of an idiot. The fact that he's even getting stronger in the first place annoys me a ton. Worst of all is gonna have to be the development in all the hokages/hoshikages/etc. i don't even know the names but you know what i mean.....they all end up weaker than naruto(?) and characterless lame-os that somehow end up working together? I don't understand, but I think they're thrown in simply because the world of Naruto has them. So back to the original, it's hard to dislike any main characters/protaganists, but very often they have trouble developing the character and sometimes just throw them in the background to do the main character's dirty work. HOWEVER, there are great moments, like in the sasuke retrieval arc, where each ninja does his own thing and it's just really awesome. I give characters 8/10, because they are inconsistent, but when it's good it's good. In shippuden it's basically never good.\
Enjoyment:\
IT'S ENJOYABLE. IT'S FUNNY/DRAMATIC/AWESOME/EXCITING. WATCH IT. Shippuden on the other hand completely lacks the funny part(they still try), the drama is unnecessarily silly, the awesomeness is pretty much all gone, and rarely things are exciting because all the battles are focused on silly details no one cares about. 9/10 for original\
Overall: 9/10. Everyone should watch this anime, despite it's not-so-good parts simply because it's friggin Naruto. And I can't stress more that Shippuden is a complete failure and that if it somehow kept to the original characterwhile developing it might've become one of the best anime out there\

 Sakura is the only female ninja of Team 7. When she first meets Naruto she is physically weak and has an immense crush on Sasuke. She dislikes Naruto as well.The only thing she's good at is her brain as the smartest girl in ninja academy her excellent chakra control, out of that she could be categorized as a kunoichi. In the first part of the Chuunin exam she is easily able to answer the questions, but in the second part she is unable to defeat the Sound ninja attacking Sasuke and Naruto. She makes a pledge to become a better ninja and a better person. To prove her commitment she cuts her long hair with a kunai.\
 \
 In the third part of the Chuunin Exam she goes up against Ino Yamanaka, her former friend but current rival for Sasuke's affections. The two defeat each other simultaneously. This turns their relationship in a rivalry between friends.\
 \
 After the time skip she is now a chuunin having been trained by Tsunade for the past two years. She is now a medic Ninja of considerable skill, enough skill to possibly defeat Tsunade one day. It is shown when she is able to do a complicated surgery to extract poisons out of Kankuro body and make an antidote of the new type poison that Sasori used,which the Suna gakure medical-nin unable to do.\
 \
 During the time skip she's also matured in personality, she become calmer compare when she were Genin, but she still has her temper especially when Naruto is fooling around in front of her she will beat him up into a bloody pulp. \
 \
 Sakura has grown not only as a medical-nin, now she's also a capable fighter. She can manage to destroy the ground with her fist using her inhuman strength, a chakra control technique she learned from Tsunade, and she is also able to beat Sasori from Akatsuki together with elder Chiyo from Sunagakure.  Additionally she is a genjutsu type, and though she has yet to use that potential she does show an almost complete immunity to being trapped in an illusion.\

 Quote: (from Obito) \"A shinobi who violates the rules is scum, but a shinobi who abandons their friends is worse than scum\".\
 \
 Major Background SpoilersLike his father, Sakumo Hatake whose skills have been compared to that of the Legendary Ninja, Kakashi is considered a genius shinobi, graduating from the Ninja Academy at age 5 and achieving the rank of Chunin at 6. A few years after these accomplishments, Kakashi's father was disgraced by the village for abandoning a mission in favor of saving his comrades, which cost the Land of Fire dearly. Deeply ashamed and ostracized even by those he had saved, Sakumo committed seppuku, leaving Kakashi to bear witness to the event. After his father's suicide, Kakashi began to adhere strictly to the rules of the shinobi &ndash; in particular the rule dictating that the success of the mission must come before the well being of one's teammates, causing him to become arrogant, humorless, and by-the-book.\
 \
 During an attempt to save Rin, Kakashi lost his left eye as a result of taking an enemy ninja's attack for Obito. To protect Kakashi in return, Obito managed to awaken his Sharingan and killed their assailant. Soon after saving Rin, a rockfall technique was triggered and a rock struck Kakashi on his blind side. He would have been buried beneath the rocks had Obito not pushed Kakashi out of the way, getting the right side of his body almost completely crushed in the process. Shortly before he died, Obito had Rin (a medical ninja) implant his Sharingan eye in Kakashi's damaged eye socket as a gift. As his first act with his new eye, Kakashi avenged Obito by killing the enemy ninja with his now-perfected Chidori technique, bringing the Kakashi of today into being.\
 \
 Years later Kakashi would become a member of the Konohagakure ANBU where he served as a squad leader. During this time, he had several kōhai, named Yugao Uzuki and Tenzo, and recognized the latter as the most successful of his kōhai. It is unknown when or why he left ANBU, but he still wears iron guards on his gloves, a characteristic of ANBU uniforms.\
 \
 Obito's death profoundly changed Kakashi, and Kakashi adopted many of Obito's traits. One such trait was Obito's concept of teamwork, which is most clearly seen in the way Kakashi tests newly-graduated students hoping to become a squad under him. He uses the bell test to test his students, which requires the three students to get the two bells he keeps on his person. Only those who get a bell get to pass, which would be difficult even with teamwork, as at least one ninja would fail regardless. However, the rule is only a ruse; the point of the test is to foster teamwork and to teach the students that teamwork is more important than the rules. Team 7 is the only team to realize this, and as such becomes the only team Kakashi passes into Genin-status. Kakashi also inherits Obito's chronic tardiness, due primarily to losing track of time during his frequent visits to Konoha's memorial site, where Obito's name is engraved. Ironically, this very habit is one that Kakashi was often annoyed at Obito about. Obito was supposedly late due to random good deeds. Kakashi's personal life appears to be as much of a mystery as the face behind the mask he has worn for most of his ninja career. He has no living family, or at least none he cares to acknowledge, and he's confirmed that everyone he loves is already dead.\
 Kakashi has an ongoing, albeit slightly one-sided, rivalry with Might Guy, with Guy constantly proclaiming that Kakashi is his rival, and considering his and Kakashi's subordinates rivals. Kakashi, however, seems indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and Kakashi has acquired a record of 49 wins and 50 losses in doing so. Given that the contests that make up this figure are so varied (ranging from Rock, Paper, Scissors to sumo-wrestling), this is not much of an achievement on Guy's part. Nevertheless, Guy is proud of his record.\
 \
 Though he evasively says that he has \"many hobbies\" when asked about himself, he is commonly seen reading of \"Icha Icha Paradise\" (イチャイチャパラダイス, Icha Icha Paradaisu, literally \"Make Out Paradise\"), an adult and probably pornographic novel authored by Jiraiya that is a runaway bestseller in the Naruto world. Kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, \"Icha Icha Violence\" (イチャイチャバイオレンス, Icha Icha Baiorensu, literally \"Make Out Violence\"). In Part II Naruto gives him the new \"Icha Icha Tactics\" (イチャイチャタクティクス, Icha Icha Takutikusu, literally \"Make Out Tactics\").\
 \
 Kakashi's Sharingan eye gives him a significant advantage in battle, as he can copy enemy techniques and use them as his own, as well as track and predict his opponent's movements flawlessly. Because it is a transplanted eye, his Sharingan eye is always active. While this would not be much of a problem for an Uchiha, his non-Uchiha blood causes it to use much more chakra than it should. Because of this, he covers it with his headband and only utilizes it in the most dangerous battles. Kakashi's use of the Sharingan is as good as that of Itachi Uchiha, though the aforementioned handicaps brought about by the nature of his eye make him somewhat weaker in comparison. In Part II Kakashi is able to develop his own Mangekyo Sharingan. With his variant he is able to manipulate space-time to conduct long range attacks, and in its two uses has been capable of severing another's arms and otherwise sending things to different dimensions. Much like the standard Sharingan, the Mangekyo Sharingan tires Kakashi considerably, and after using it only three times he was hospitalized for a week due to its chakra usage.\
 \
 With his Sharingan Kakashi has been able to copy more than one thousand jutsu, giving him the nickname \"Copy Ninja Kakashi\". As a result, Kakashi's arsenal most prominently features ninjutsu abilities and has led to him becoming a specialist in the field. Many of the jutsu he has been seen copying in the series are water-based attacks, though most of these he only uses against the person he copies them from. He does, however, use Water Release: Water Encampment Wall on occasion as a way to block attacks. He less frequently uses other elemental attacks such as Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique to attack opponents or Earth Release: Inner Decapitation Technique (土遁・心中斬首の術, Doton: Shinjū Zanshu no Jutsu, Viz \"Groundhog Technique Decapitation\", English TV \"Headhunter Jutsu\") to pull opponents below ground and immobilize them. He can also create shadow clones, though because he lacks Naruto's chakra reserves, he exercises the ability with caution, rarely creating more than one at a time.\
 \
 While Kakashi specializes in the use of ninjutsu due to his Sharingan he is fairly adept with other jutsu types, though his use of them is rarely seen. Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing Technique (魔幻・奈烙見の術, Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu) causes his opponent to see what they would find a horrifying vision, keeping them preoccupied until they can overcome the illusion. A Thousand Years of Pain (death in english dub) (千年殺し, Sennen Goroshi) consists of Kakashi forcefully plunging his index and middle fingers into an opponent's rectum. While only capable of launching the opponent humorous distances in typical uses, the fingers can be replaced with kunai attached with exploding tags to actually do damage to the person one is attacking.\
 \
 When he was younger Kakashi was taught how to use the Rasengan by the Fourth Hokage. Because the Rasengan is meant to have the user's chakra nature mixed with it, Kakashi attempted to add his lightning-based chakra to it, though was ultimately unsuccessful. In time he instead created the Chidori, his only original jutsu. After the jutsu's initial creation Kakashi was unable to use the Chidori to its full potential as the sheer speed of the attack left his normal eyes unable to see any form of an enemy counterattack. After acquiring the Sharingan, however, he was able to overcome this shortcoming. Through repeated use and increased proficiency with it, Kakashi's Chidori has been upgraded and renamed to the Lightning Blade due to him having cut through a bolt of lightning with it.\

 When Sasuke was young, his clan was murdered by his older brother, Itachi. With his parents and family now gone, his brother spared him and left him to survive by himself. He told Sasuke to hate him. Sasuke tried to forget about the past by applying himself in the ninja academy and fitting in with the rest of the leaf village.\
 \
 After his fight with Naruto, he believes he's been wasting his time \"playing ninja\" with the people of the leaf village. His new goal is to get stronger so he can avenge his clan by killing Itachi and then restore the Uchiha clan.\
 \
 As a wielder of the Sharingan (the kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan), he learns to use Chidori and has a vast knowledge of the various Fire Jutsus. The curse seal which Orichimaru gives him during the Chuunin exam, at first, enhanced his power but at the risk of killing him. Now he can use it of his own free will.\
 \
 Claiming at first that he doesn't need any friends, he is forced to contradict himself when he sees that either Naruto or Sakura are in danger. Remembering this type of Sasuke is what brings motivation to Naruto. Sasuke openly admitted to Naruto that he was his closest friend.\
 \
 <b>Appearance</b>\
 Sasuke has black hair with a blue tint that lengthens as the story goes with onyx eyes and has lighter skin than his brother Itachi. Like many other members of his clan, his hair hangs over both sides of his face to roughly his cheeks. In his curse seal form, he has grey skin with wings on his back that resemble giant webbed hands. He also has hair similar to Madara Uchiha except in a greyish-blue color.\
 \
 At the beginning of Part I, Sasuke's clothing made up a blue, short-sleeved shirt with a raised collar and the Uchiha crest on the back and white shorts. An interesting thing is that during Part I the Uchiha symbol on his back gets smaller each time he changes his outfit. In the last stage of the Chunin exams, he wore a black, one pieced version of this outfit but eventually went back to his original clothes.\
 \
 In Part II, Sasuke has grown noticeably taller (almost eye height with Itachi) and slightly more muscular. wears a white long sleeved shirt that's open at the torso with a smaller version of the Uchiha crest on his collar. He wears black pants with a blue cloth hanging from his half way up his stomach to his knees. He also wears a purple rope belt (Japanese name: Shimenawa) tied in a bow fashion found on many Sound ninja, only the bow is in a different style and is tied in the front instead of the back. He also will at points remove his shirt and hang it from his belt around his waist to give his wings in Curse Seal Level 2 room to move (also without transforming).\
 \
 Sasuke, even though claiming to be emotionless, wouldn't kill unless it was necessary until Madara Uchiha twisted his personality even further by telling him that his brother, Itachi, after he had killed him, was ordered to kill their clan and suffer for the sake of the village. After knowing this, he suddenly turns far colder and seeks for revenge on Konoha. However, after he had calmed down, he noticed how confused he really was and revived Orochimaru to request answers to his questions about his clan, Konoha, and what shinobi and the Hokage really are. He's currently helping Naruto and the others put an end to the war and announced that he plans to become the next Hokage. But when the the war concluded, Sasuke made it clear that his goal was to become a new kind of Hokage, a kind of Hokage that wants to banish darkness from the Ninja World and to do so he believes all the old Kages should be killed. He also wants to conclude things with Naruto and so he invites him to one final concluding battle. The battle ends with both Naruto and Sasuke losing one of their hands. While both lie on the ground he finally accepts Naruto's feelings and stops his path of revenge to return to the village.\
 In chapter 700, it is shown that he has a daughter with Sakura.\

 Born in Konohagakure, a ninja village hidden in the leaves, Naruto Uzumaki was destined for greatness. When born, a powerful nine-tailed demon fox attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage, the leader of the Hidden Leaf Village, sealed the demon fox within Naruto's newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.\
 \
 Despite the Fourth Hokage's dying wish that Naruto be viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a <i>Jinchuuriki</i>) the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demon were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracized by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.\
 \
 Naruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Coy, raffish and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to \"Team Seven\" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.\
 \
 Vowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.\
 \
 In all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers.\
 \
 He becomes the hero of his village, after defeating the six Pains all by himself.\
 He then befriends the nine-tails inside of him and control its powers. In time, he also becomes more dependable considering the Shinobi Alliance completely relies and respects his power, even the reanimated previous Hokages.\
 He later receives chakra from all the nine tailed beasts and then gains the power of the sage of the six paths, along with Sasuke.\
 At the end of the manga, he is married to Hinata with two children, Boruto and Himawari, and becomes the seventh hokage.\

      description = "Zaku Abumi was a Genin-level ninja from Otogakure. He was part of the team that took the Chunin exam in order to assassinate Sasuke Uchiha. Like many Sound ninja, he has been physically altered with unnatural enhancements that enhance his abilities; in his case, he was fitted with hollow air tubes that extend through his arms and open through his hands, allowing him to propel a combination of air pressure and sound in various ratios, controlled by his chakra. Unlike his partners, a glance into his past and how Orochimaru recruited him was given, making him a far more dramatic character. The anime shows that he was an orphan living on the streets who hustled by stealing for a living, and was almost always beaten for it. Orochimaru had told him he had potential and liked the strength in his eyes. He refuses to give up, even at the cost of his own life. \
 After saving his partner Dosu from Rock Lee's lotus attack, he brutally fought off Sakura who attempted to prevent him from killing Sasuke. After the helpless Sakura lay beaten on the ground, he and his team had to fight Team Asuma. During the fight, Sasuke finally regained consciousness, and asked Sakura who had injured her. Zaku took the credit, and Sasuke proceeded to dislocate and greatly injure Zaku's shoulders. He was the only Sound ninja to fight Sasuke, as the others retreated. During his fight with Shino Aburame in the preliminary exams, he overcame the injuries to his shoulders and was able to use his arms to defend himself against Shino. Due to his cockiness, he attempted to attack both Shino and his approaching army of Kekai insects, not noticing that the chakra-eating bugs had already filled the tubes in his arms, preventing him from attacking and even more brutally crippling and preventing him from doing any damage in the future (In the manga, his right arm was blown off due to the kikai bugs Shino used to fill up Zaku's air tubes, and the left was kept intact but halfway sliced. In the anime both of his arms are left intact, but have numerous holes in them, achieving the same, albeit less gruesome, result). Dosu says he would avenge him (or rather, his severed arms), but failed to do so.\
 \
 Zaku, along with Kin Tsuchi, is later murdered as a sacrifice for Orochimaru's Impure World Resurrection for the First and Second Hokages against the Third Hokage. \

 Shino Aburame is character who has a fascination with bugs; most of his spare time is spent watching bugs, he often makes analogies to bugs when talking. In addition to liking bugs, Shino is characterized by his emotionless, solitary, and collected way of doing things. He speaks very bluntly and never allows emotion to interfere with his judgment, sometimes offending people in doing so. Despite his odd personality and occasionally arguing with Kiba, Shino has a very strong sense of connection with his teammates and allies.\
 \
 Shino alongside Hinata Hyuga and Kiba Inuzuka is in team 8 which is led by Kurenai Yuuhi.\
 \
 In battle, Shino is able to take great use of his intelligence, being able to use his analytical and observational skills to make shrewd judgments with pinpoint reasoning. As a member of the Aburame clan, Shino was infused at birth with a special breed of insects that feed on chakra. In return for becoming a living hive, the insects attack opponents, usually while he distracts them, and carry out other tasks as he commands. Shino has found a number of uses for these bugs, and as such has devised a number of jutsu that utilize them for varying purposes, such as creating copies of himself or using bugs for defensive purposes.\

A few years later, Chouza learned that Chouji was treated as an outcast because of his weight and the belief that Akimichi were useless ninja.

As the leader of his clan, it is highly logical that he is skilled in all of his clan's secret techniques.

He is also skilled at using a staff in combat, which seems to also grow when he uses the Multi-Size Technique.\

 Choji Akimichi is a childhood friend of Shikamaru Nara. Together with him Ino Yamanaka, and Asuma Sarutobi they make team 10. Choji has a love for food, his favorite being Korean barbecue, general snacks and sweets, and basically anything that is edible. His nigh-constant hunger is a constant annoyance for his teammates, as sating himself often comes before other necessities such as stealth and teamwork. Because of this, his teammates often use food against him, such as offering him food as a reward for accomplishing a task or simply using his favorite foods as a form of blackmail. Despite his open display for his love of food, Choji is very sensitive about his size and becomes highly agitated when somebody calls him \"fat.\" Once called \"fat,\" Choji's resolve to fight is elevated to new levels and he becomes much more hostile to his opponents than he would otherwise. Just as they use food against him, Choji's teammates use this personality trait against him as well. Should Choji be reluctant to fight, one of them need only comment on his size to spur him into combat form.\
 \
 As an Akimichi, Choji's style of combat focuses on increasing his size. At the series' start he uses Multi-Size Technique to serve this purpose, reshaping him into a large, round form.\

 <b>Short Overview</b>\
 Baki is one of the strongest Sand Jonin in the Sand village. He is an important member of the Sunagakure's advisory council and is probably the second-in-command after the Kazekage and is respected throughout the whole village. He is also probably the Fourth Kazekage's most trusted Jonin as he was in charge of the invasion in to Konoha and the team leader of Team Baki, which consists of Gaara,Temari and Kankuro, the Fourth Kazekage 's children. It is speculated that he is very strong, considering that he was the teacher of Gaara who later became the Fifth Kazekage, who is probably in Part 1 and 2 the strongest and most dangerous ninja in the Sand Village.\
 \
 <b>Personality</b>\
 Baki is a loyal, kind and respected ninja. With his experience in battle, he holds a lot of confidence. He has a soldier personality, a patriot. A caring and kind person, but if anything comes in his village or country's way or his loved ones, he will do anything to stop it. During the Chuunin exam, he had confidence in the ability of all of his team members, although he comments on Kankuro not taking the battles seriously enough. He also worries frequently about Gaara's mental stability and his control over Shukaku.\

 Deidara is a missing-nin from Iwagakure. Before joining Akatsuki, Deidara was as a terrorist bomber for hire, where his work attracted the attention of Pain. Pain sent other Akatsuki members to recruit Deidara, though he refused. After being defeated by Itachi Uchiha, however, Deidara was forced to join the organization. Deidara maintained a deep loathing for Itachi from that point further and became determined to defeat him, even training one of his eyes to overcome Itachi's signature ability: genjutsu. Deidara was partnered with Sasori upon joining the organization, whose artistic ability and insight Deidara admired. After Sasori's death Deidara is paired with Tobi whom he treats as a disciple. Despite Tobi's habit of accidentally angering Deidara, Deidara takes great care to keep Tobi out of harm's way and even dedicates his final moments to apologizing to him.\
 \
 In battle, Deidara uses special mouths in the palm of each hand to create Exploding Clay, chakra-infused clay that explodes on command. He commonly uses the command \"Katsu\" to trigger it. The blast strength of his creations is determined by how much chakra he adds to them. His clay can take on any size or form, ranging from microscopic in size to copies of himself as tall as a skyscraper. Deidara refers to his creations as art, believing the most beautiful thing about them to be their detonation. His admiration for his art is such that he believes it can't be defeated, leading to overconfidence in battle. Depending on the complexity or potency of one of his works, Deidara applies it a designation from anywhere between \"C1\" to \"C4\", the former being the most basic and the latter being his strongest and most complex attack. For his final act, Deidara also has a mouth on his chest that, once provided with clay, turns him into a living bomb that destroys everything in a 10 kilometer radius.\

At that time Sakura strikes him on the head again for daydreaming something perverted and the group is attacked by the previous ninja group, who turn out to be members of the Fūma. After with fighting the other Fūma again, she leads the three to Orochimaru's lair. When she did locate the lair, she ended up in a rope trap where she persuaded the three to let her help in exchange for seeing Arashi.\
 Sasame planned on giving Naruto, Jiraiya and Sakura tea with a drug to make them fall asleep, and handing them over to Kamikiri in exchange for being allowed to see Arashi. However, the plan failed when Kamikiri revealed that he wanted to kill them instead of capturing them, and Sasame was knocked unconscious when she protested against that. Naruto, Sakura, and Jiraiya revealed that they had only pretended to go along with her plan, and defeated the three Fūma ninja. Almost as soon as she regained consciousness, Sasame tried to commit suicide over having failed, but Jiraiya stopped her and convinced her to show them to the hideout.\
 Despite being ordered to stay behind, Sasame follows Naruto into the hideout and saves him from a slowly flooding room by opening the trapdoor, allowing him to catch up with Sakura. She later saves Naruto from Kagerō (who was disguised as Kabuto Yakushi) by giving Sakura a seal that will free them from her attack. When she met Arashi, she saw what had become of her cousin she decided to help Naruto and Sakura in defeating him. After the incident, she decided to join forces with Hanzaki and the remaining members of the Fūma clan to rebuild the clan's former glory.\

 Gaara was introduced in the series in Chuunin Exams arc, as a violent shinobi from Konoha's allied country, the Wind country. He came to Konoha with his siblings Temari and Kankuro, and with his mentor Baki, to participate in Chuunin exams.\
 \
 From the first look, he was shown as merciless and violent individual. Due to his hard childhood, and lack of love, Gaara grew up hating everybody around him, loving only himself. \
 \
 In fateful incident about 6 years before the main story time, he made himself a tattoo of Japanese Kanji letter \"Ai,\" which stands for \"Love.\" In Gaara's case, that Love was for himself, as he was \"Demon loving only himself.\"\
 \
 Gaara's point of view dramatically changed after a clash with Naruto, who taught him the true meaning of loving others. Since then, Gaara always feels in debt to Naruto, and tries to help him as much as he can.\
 \
 Like Naruto, Gaara is a Jinchuuriki who holds within him the one tailed beast, Ichibi no Shukaku. Gaara also relates to Naruto in that in his early years, Gaara was often repelled by other children, and feared by Suna's citizens due to the incredible power he possessed.\

When Naruto is injured while fighting with Kabuto Yakushi, he replies, \"Hey Gamakichi, do we have to wait for the kid to croak till we get snacks, cuz' I'm getting hungry\". Although in the filler arcs Gamatatsu showed that he does care about Naruto's life as he was ready to rescue him before Gamakichi talked him out of it. It should be noted that Gamatatsu appears to be the most subservient and loyal of the main frog summons as he was willing to serve Naruto before Gamakichi brought up the snack remark. While being naive and childishly stupid, he does sometimes make use of his natural curiosity to help Naruto solve puzzles (like the mystery of the Ghost Warrior in the filler arcs). Gamatatatsu's obsession for snacks is so great that he waited a year since his first summon for the snack he was promised, even though he didn't get it. He is always hungry and asking his summoner for snacks, and often gets mixed up in unusual predicaments which he counts on his \"big brother Gamakichi\" to get him out of. In the english dub, his voice is jocularly high and he is usually used for comic relief when he is summoned. He also openly refers to Gamabunta as \"daddy\", which the older toad either chooses to ignore or simply doesn't mind.\

      description = "The Country of Mist has had its share of civil wars and has always used their Shinobi with Advanced Bloodlines as the primary weapons. Over time, those with \"Advanced Blood\" came to be hated and feared. This forced those with advanced bloods into hiding in order to live in peace. Haku was one of the few people in the Mist with Advanced Blood left. \
 When Haku was just a young child, his father discovered that his wife was part of an Advanced Bloodline. Haku's father proceeded to kill his mother and then went after him. In Haku's fright, he killed his father and fled his small village, believing himself to be a monster: a monster loved by no one.\
 \
 On one faithful day, Haku looked up in the slums of the back alley to see a Shinobi staring down at him, this Shinobi was Zabuza. Haku then proclaimed, \"You have the same eyes as me\". Zabuza realized that Haku was one of the Advanced Bloodline limit carriers, and took the child under his wing. Haku was raised by Zabuza as \"a tool\" to be called upon when needed in exchange for his \"freedom\" from the slums. He learned how to use his unique abilities and eventually became a Hunter-Nin. When Zabuza's plan to kill Mizukage fails, Haku fled the village along with Zabuza to fulfill his job as a veritable \"a tool.\"\
 \
 Haku's slender frame and delicate appearance enables him to disguise himself in various ways. In fact, while finding medicine to treat Zabuza's wounds Haku runs into Naruto. Naruto mistakenly believes Haku is a girl. As we see in the ensuing brawls, it is not appearance that determines strength. Rather, under that soft face we see that Haku has an adroit knack for speed and Jutsu skill. Combined with his knowledge of the human body, Haku can target his opponent's vital organs and kill them instantly using pinpoint accuracy. The main choice to attack these vital organs is with simple needles that are used by physicians in the battle field.\
 \
 Haku's bloodline originates in the country of Mist so it is no surprise that his Jutsus are water based. His \"Flying Water Needles\" is a technique whence he uses his chakra to create ice needles via water on the ground. Furthermore, he uses his chakra to control the path of the needles and strike the enemy. His other technique, \"Demonic Ice Mirrors\" uses water to create ice mirrors to surround the enemy. He then combines himself with the mirrors and uses the reflection to transport himself from mirror to mirror while attacking his enemy from all angles. His most incredible ability however, is the ability to do one-handed seals. This allows him to complete various tasks that are not capable of being accomplished without having a free hand.\
 \
 Although Haku is an exceptional fighter, he is a kind ninja who is saddened by unnecessary death. His fighting spirit comes from the will to protect his most \"precious person,\" because \"when a person has something precious to protect, that is when they can become truly strong.\"\
 \
 Haku is later 'revived' by Kabuto using Impure World Resurrection during the fourth shinobi world war.\

 Kisame Hoshigaki is a missing-nin from Kirigakure and is partnered with Itachi Uchiha. He gets along considerably better with Itachi than most Akatsuki members do with their own partners, immediately doing as Itachi asks of him and always looking out for Itachi's well-being. His former country, the Land of Water, now seeks him out for plotting to overthrow its government and being involved in numerous assassinations. When he was still loyal to Kirigakure, he was one of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, a group of ninja that wield particularly large weapons in battle. Kisame's weapon is called Samehada, a scale-covered sword that shaves off skin instead of cutting and is capable of absorbing untold amounts of chakra. Samehada only allows Kisame to wield it; if anyone else tries to pick it up, spikes protrude from its handle and it returns to Kisame's side. Like other characters who have trained to be one of the Seven Swordsmen, Kisame enjoys mutilating his opponents, as seen when he suggests cutting off Naruto Uzumaki's legs to make him easier to carry.\
 \
 Kisame has a distinctive shark-like appearance, complete with pale blue skin, small white eyes, gill-like facial structures, and sharp triangular teeth. Even his name, Kisame, means \"demon shark\". His shark-like qualities carry over to the type of techniques he uses in battle, as he often shapes bodies of water into the forms of sharks that proceed to attack opponents. If there is no water source where he happens to be fighting, Kisame can use Water Release: Exploding Water Shockwave to create a lake's worth of water to be used for attacks. Kisame is also noted to have a particularly large reserve of chakra; even when he fights at 30% power in one instance his chakra supply is compared to that of a Nine-Tailed Demon Fox-enhanced Naruto Uzumaki.\

 Hyuuga Hinata is the eldest daughter of the Hyuga clan's main branch. \"Hyuga\" (日向) means \"toward the sun\" while \"Hinata\" is a pun, as it is another way to read this kanji and means \"a sunny place.\" Hinata was trained by her father, Hiashi Hyuga, to become the clan's heiress, though in time he came to deem her a lost cause. Believing her to be of lesser skill than her younger sister, Hanabi Hyuga, her father left Hinata in Kurenai Yuhi's care once she was assigned to Team 8, claiming he didn't care what happened to her. Throughout her early time in Team 8, Hinata's lack of self-confidence and unwillingness to fight hamper her abilities. Although she would train to improve her skills, she would immediately give up when faced with competition and failed every mission she was assigned as a result.\
 \
 In an attempt to change herself, Hinata enters the Chunin Exams, where she is pit against her cousin, Neji Hyuga, in the exam's preliminary matches. Neji is quick to ridicule Hinata for her personality traits and attempts to convince her that she is a failure who will never be able to change herself, bringing her to tears. Naruto Uzumaki's encouragement, however, empowers her to fight her cousin despite repeatedly being struck down. Although she is defeated, Naruto's words have a lasting effect on Hinata and she becomes more confident in her abilities, and even sticks up for herself by telling Neji that he is the one who is attempting to fight against what cannot be changed. After recovering from her wounds, Hinata continues training to prove herself to her father and Naruto. Her efforts are successful in both regards, as she is eventually able to acquire a better relationship with her father, who encourages her to continue working on improving herself. Naruto has also come to hold her in a higher standing, and he tells her that while he had considered her timid and weird before, he now views her as a likable person.\
 \
 Hinata has a long-standing crush on Naruto, which has been present since their time in the Academy. Her feelings for him are rooted in his determination, confidence, and strength, all of which Hinata lacks. With her affection for Naruto, Hinata is constantly willing to break away from her normal personality traits in order to help him. She also becomes more assertive for Naruto, and also doesn't hesitate to defend him, even to himself. Her feelings for Naruto are one of the driving forces in her self-improvement, as she tries to gain strength in an attempt to both impress him and become like him. When they meet again in Part II, Hinata is unable to bring herself to greet Naruto and passes out when he comes to greet her, her feelings for him having apparently been amplified during his absence. Despite this, she gradually becomes more comfortable around Naruto, going from being unable to look him in the eye to being able to talk to him, and is able to work with him without difficulty when they are on missions together.\
 \
 As a member of the Hyuga clan, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, which gives her an almost 360 field of vision. During the Chunin Exams, she displays the ability to focus the Byakugan's sight, increasing the distance that her eyes can see. She also specializes in the Gentle Fist fighting style, which allows her to damage her opponent's chakra circulatory system and inner organs directly with even a slight tap. In her quest to get stronger, Hinata creates a new ability during the anime's Bikochu arc called Protection of the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms (守護八卦六十四掌, Shugohakke Rokujūyon Shō), a combination of the Hyuga clan's most powerful techniques. With it Hinata emits streams of chakra from her palms to create extremely sharp blades that she can use to hit any target in her field of vision. Due to the speed at which these blades move, the amount of control she has over them, as well as her ability to manipulate their size, Hinata can use this technique to attack and defend simultaneously.\
 \
 Sometime after the fourth shinobi war, she marries Naruto and bears their two children, Boruto and Himawari.\

 Neji Hyuuga is a stoic member of Might Guy's Team Guy, consisting of himself, Rock Lee, and Tenten. Neji and Lee have somewhat of a rivalry, much like that of Guy and Kakashi Hatake. Lee is determined to prove that a \"failure\" such as himself can defeat a \"genius\" such as Neji. Neji, however, doesn't seem to be interested in this goal of Lee's, and Lee doesn't seem to have made an effort to prove the point to Neji. Despite this apparent clashing of ideals between the two, Neji seems to get along fairly well with Tenten, with the latter often helping Neji with his training. Neji and Tenten also tend to share opinions on Lee and Guy's overreactive behaviors, often wondering how they can train the way they do.\
 \
 As a member of the Hyuga clan, Neji has a Byakugan, allowing him to see the chakra flow of others and block the flow upon contact with his Gentle Fist style. As a member of the clan's branch house, Neji can never hope to be taught how to use the clan's most secret techniques by the clan's elders. Despite this, Neji has learned many of the clan's strongest techniques independently, even creating a few unique skills of his own. Because of this, Neji is known as a genius ninja and graduated from the Academy as the #1 rookie.\
 \
 Because his father, Hizashi Hyuga, was a member of a branch house of the Hyuga clan, Neji was born into the branch house. As a result, he was branded with the Hyuga branch family seal at a young age so that the members of the main house could keep him in check. Hizashi, believing Neji to be denied his potential as a branch house member, openly resented the main house, causing Neji to acquire the same feelings due to his father's influence. In time, Neji's hatred for the main house would increase exponentially as result of Hizashi being sacrificed to save the life of Hiashi Hyuga, Hizashi's twin brother. Neji believed that his father was forced to die for his twin brother. Because of this, Neji came to feel that fate was something decided at birth and that no matter what one does, people cannot escape their destiny. This idea would go on to shape Neji's life, creating a deep hatred for the main house and all of its members. \
 \
 After the Chunnin Exams when Neji fights Naruto his both his great skill and potential are recognized by the clan leader, his uncle Hiashi Hyuuga, and is sought out by him to train with the main branch of the family to further enhance Neji's skills. This helps ease some of the tensions between the two branches of the Hyuuga clan.\

 Hiashi Hyuga is the head of the Hyuga Clan. He is the father of Hinata and Hanabi Hyuga, twin brother of the late Hizashi Hyuga, and uncle of Neji Hyuga.\
 \
 As the father of Hinata Hyuga and the uncle of Neji Hyuga, Hiashi has a significant role in the lives of his daughter and nephew.\
 \
 Hiashi was born seconds before his twin brother Hizashi Hyuga, making him the head of Hyuga clan. The fact that Neji would never be able to succeed the clan, and that he would be marked with a curse mark so that he could be disciplined caused friction between the brothers.\
 \
 When his daughter, Hinata, was kidnapped by a the Head Ninja of Kumogakure no sato, who was acting as an ambassador to Konoha at the time, he had no choice but to kill her kidnapper. The Land of Lightning overlooked the kidnapping, and they demanded a life for a life, asking Hiashi surrender his life and be killed, or else a new wave of warfare between the Hidden Leaf and Cloud villages. While Hiashi planned on accepting the punishment, his brother insisted on taking his place, saying that while he hated the main family, he wanted to save his brother and decide his own destiny. He asked Hiashi to tell Neji about his decision and his reasons before leaving to be killed.\
 \
 Hiashi's general personality is very stern and strict, as he assigns both his daughters arduous training, rarely complimenting their performance. This is especially true with Hinata; when she was assigned to Kurenai Yuhi, he told her that he was unconcerned about the possibility that she would die, saying that the Hyuga Clan had no use for a weak successor.\

He blamed Kaiza for what had happened, believing that he, in dying, had broken his promise to protect the land. \
 Inari's outlook is changed after he meets Naruto Uzumaki, who also had a horrible past, but learned to deal with it. Naruto's unwillingness to quit and concern for others helped Inari to realize the power of will over fate, and that no risk is too great to protect something precious. He therefore grabbed his crossbow and rallied the townspeople, who proceeded to rise up against Gato's men. He also attempted to save his mother from the thugs, who would have killed him, had it not been for Naruto. Along with Naruto and Kakashi Hatake, they were able to drive away Gato's thugs. \

 Kiba Inuzuka  is one of the main supporting characters of the series. He is a Chūnin-level shinobi of Konohagakure and a member of the Inuzuka Dog-User clan, as well as a member of the Chūnin team, Team Kurenai, along with Shino Aburame and Hinata Hyūga. Kiba is usually seen with and fights in collaboration with his partner, Akamaru. \
 \
 Kiba is often short-tempered and impulsive (in stark contrast to his teammates Shino and Hinata), and can be prone to making mistakes when he becomes agitated in battle. The fact that he enjoys combat, as well as a habit of showing a joyful smile when facing a particularly strong opponent, indicates that he is willing to risk his life for a mission, and is rather bloodthirsty. He deeply cares for Akamaru, and is willing to do whatever is necessary to protect him. And, despite his rather gruff attitude, many of Kiba's actions reveal that he is very close to his older sister, Hana Inuzuka, and remains fiercely loyal to the Inuzuka clan. \
 \
 Kiba's personality and jutsu style are further enhanced by his wild appearance. While clearly human, he has several physical traits more akin to animals. Like the rest of his clan, he has messy brown hair, sharp black eyes with vertical slit-like pupils, pronounced canine teeth, and nails that he can change into claws. He also has the distinct red fang markings of the Inuzuka clan on his cheeks. \

 Jiraiya is one of the three powerful ninjas originated from Konoha (village hidden in the leaves) and trained by the third Hokage, Hiruzen Sarutobi. His two team mates were Tsunade and Orochimaru. Later on, they became known as the Legendary Three Ninja, also known as \"Sannin.\"\
 \
 Jiraiya is also a full-pledged pervert. He adores good looking women and gets distracted by their sight often. He often gives the reason that he is doing research for his writing. Jiraiya is the author of the Icha Icha Series which Kakashi loves to read.\
 \
 Among other traits he is a toad-tamer, with the ability to summon powerful toads at will to aid him in battle. He holds a key part in teaching and training Naruto.\
 \
 Jiraiya also trained the 4th Hokage, Minato Namikaze. Another one of his notable students was Nagato, who would later become known as Pain. When Jiraiya infiltrates the rain village to get information regarding Pain, he dies in battle against all six Pains.\

 Kankurou is initially characterized by his apparent dislike for children, as seen when he is noticeably irritated while in the presence of someone younger than him. Though, this seems to have gone away as time passed by. This is most evident when he is with Gaara, who Kankurou is forced to put up with due to the fear his younger brother imposes on him. Despite their apparent differences, Gaara and Kankurou become very close over the timeskip as Gaara begins to confide in Kankurou and shares his dreams of wanting to risk his life to protect Sunagakure. As such, Kankurou has become very protective of Gaara, willing to challenge anyone who puts Gaara down in his presence. When Gaara is captured by Akatsuki, Kankurou rushes to his brother's aid in an attempt to save him and even after being nearly killed as a result he does not falter in his resolve to find Gaara.\
 \
 Kankurou has shown to be a rather violent and brutal opponent, often leaving his opponents in extreme pain after battle. He is a talented puppeteer, and with each of his appearances in the major arcs is seen with a new puppet in his arsenal. The three puppets that have been introduced were all originally created by Sasori, and came into Kankurou's possession some time after the former left Sunagakure. Karasu, the first of Kankurou's puppets to make an appearance, has been heavily modified by Kankurou. Because of this it is highly offensive, having numerous concealed weapons and being able to detach any of its limbs for separate attacks. Kuroari, the second of Kankurou's puppets to make an appearance, is used to capture opponents for assassination purposes. Once an opponent is captured within it each of Kuroari's arms convert to saw-blades and slice through the confined opponent. Sanshouo, the third of Kankurou's puppets to make an appearance, is not seen in action in the manga. In the anime, Sanshouo is shown to have a hollow body that Kankurou can take cover in to defend against attacks. These puppets seem to be designed to work together to some degree, as Kankurou frequently uses them in tandem to increase their effectiveness. Karasu, for example, can blanket an area in smoke while Kuroari fires weapons at the blinded opponent.\

 Kankurou is initially characterized by his apparent dislike for children, as seen when he is noticeably irritated while in the presence of someone younger than him. Though, this seems to have gone away as time passed by. This is most evident when he is with Gaara, who Kankurou is forced to put up with due to the fear his younger brother imposes on him. Despite their apparent differences, Gaara and Kankurou become very close over the timeskip as Gaara begins to confide in Kankurou and shares his dreams of wanting to risk his life to protect Sunagakure.

Kidomaru can create a stronger, golden webbing called Spider Sticky Gold that hardens upon contact with oxygen to metal-like quality.

 Kimimaro was the fifth member of the Sound Four, thus temporarily changing their group name to the Sound Five. The original four were forced to accept him against their will, as Kimimaro's combat abilities exceeded all of their skills combined. He was the sole survivor of the Kaguya clan, who could manipulate their bodies' skeletal frame. The Kaguya clan was wiped out when they attacked Kirigakure, seemingly for no reason other than the desire to kill. Having underestimated their opponent's defenses, they were slaughtered to the last man, with only Kimimaro surviving.\
 \
 NOTE: Though some fans believe that his full name was Kimimaro Kaguya, the second databook only said his name as Kimimaro.\
 \
 Kimimaro was referred to by Orochimaru as the most powerful member of the clan, having \"abilities that even that war-loving clan feared\". Because of this, he was locked away in a cage for most of his life, only released occasionally when needed to fight other clans.\
 \
 Like many of Orochimaru's closest followers, Kimimaro was branded with a cursed seal, which gives him greater power at the expense of his free will. When in his level 2 form, his appearance is similar to that of a dinosaur, with dark gray skin, six large bone spines on the back of his chest, and a long bone spiked tail. He also possesses a great deal of control over his cursed seal, as he is able to control its spread throughout his body without fully activating it. Kimimaro was apparently friends with Jugo at one point, and his control over his cursed seal impressed the latter. Karin claims that Kimimaro was the only one who could stop Jugo without getting hurt.\
 \
 Kimimaro succumbed to his disease and died in the middle of his fight with Gaara during the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, moments before he was about to deliver the finishing blow to Gaara and Lee.\

 Dosu is a genin from the Sound Village, and leader of his squad. They were under the direct supervision of Orochimaru during the chunin exams. Dosu uses a sound amplifying device on his left arm, called a melody arm, to increase the vibrations he makes when he hits something, causing damage to the opponents ears and messes up their sense of balance. He is the only member of his squad to advance to the second stage in the chunin exams after defeating Choji Akimichi. \
 He showed dedication to Orochimaru's task of killing Sasuke Uchiha, but later became disillusioned after learning that Orochimaru had given Sasuke a cursed seal. Realising that he and his team were actually pawns used to determine Sasuke's worth, Dosu's outlook changed as he lost any and all loyalty towards Orochimaru and vowed to kill Sasuke for the purpose of undermining Orochimaru. Because of this, he would attempt to take down Gaara prior to the actual match to lessen the obstacles beforehand, a rather rash decision that cost Dosu his life.\

One of its special abilities is that it has access to close to unlimited sources of chakra. \
 The demon fox's attacks were seemingly random, the only apparent reason for its appearances being its attraction to places of human malice. It attacked Konohagakure twelve years before the start of the series. None of the ninja of the village were able to defeat it until the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, arrived to deal with it. Minato sacrificed his life to seal the fox into the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, with the Dead Demon Consuming Seal. Rather than completely seal off the fox's great power, however, Minato only sealed away a portion of it, giving Naruto access to the rest for unknown reasons. Prior to performing the seal Minato gave a key to Jiraiya to either strengthen or weaken the seal should the need arise. The seal naturally becomes weaker as the years pass, and in the event that it is broken the demon fox will be released; however, the bond between Naruto and Kyuubi, and the bond between Jinchuuriki (host) and tailed beast in general, is of a such character that if the seal is broken, Naruto will die immediately thereafter. And if Naruto dies, and the seal is not broken, Kyuubi will die with him. Therefore Kyuubi uses some of its chakra to enhance Naruto's healing abilities and will sometimes \"take over\" (lend Naruto its chakra without him asking for it) in order to keep him alive.\

Unable to use most ninja techniques, Lee dedicates himself to using solely taijutsu, ninja techniques similar to martial arts. Lee dreams of becoming a \"splendid ninja\" despite his inabilities.\

Naruto soon rescues the boy while returning from a mission and sidetracking to get a \"legendary fermented bamboo\" for Ichiraku Ramen and takes him back to Konoha to recover, while there giving him the nickname Menma (which means fermented bamboo). \
 When the hospital that he is staying at catches fire, Menma's memory returns while he saves an infant, much to his dismay. After being permitted to stay, Menma builds a good reputation with the village elders, along with Naruto, by performing various odd jobs. After a bandit attacks, they go on a search for Menma's memories along with Neji and Tenten. He eventually sacrifices himself in order to set off an explosion to prevent the bandits from flooding the village, saving the village. Menma's death noticeably affected Naruto, who soon after pretended to have the \"legendary fermented ramen\" with Menma's ocarina, the last remaining memento of Menma.\
 \
 Menma was able to use ninjutsu with his ocarina (similar to Tayuya's abilities), enhancing an individual's strength and speed, and could move more quickly than Neji did at top speed. These abilities caused Neji and Tenten to suspect that he was a ninja from the Land of Sound. \

 He is the leader of Team Guy, consisting of Rock Lee, Neji Hyuga, and Tenten.\
 \
 Guy, and by extension Lee, lives his life by his own \"My Rules\" philosophy, which involves setting tougher self-imposed penalties for failure so something good comes of it. For example, he vowed to walk 500 laps around Konoha on his hands if he lost a contest with Kakashi, and proceeded to do so upon losing, even though people eventually stopped paying attention. He also doesn't hesitate to do things he doesn't enjoy or that others might find embarrassing if it means his own self-improvement, as seen with his belief that one cannot dislike food regardless of its ingredients or taste. In addition, Guy values his youth to a great degree and dislikes the idea that he may not be as young as he once was. To help remedy this problem he spends large amounts of time with his younger teammates, hoping to acquire some of their youthful properties. Likewise, he often refers to himself as \"Konoha's Prideful Green Beast\".\
 \
 Guy is the self-proclaimed rival of Kakashi Hatake. Kakashi, however, is indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Kakashi also seems to have a habit of unintentionally ignoring Guy when Guy is lecturing him, which usually results in Guy asking himselif why Kakashi \"has to act so cool\". Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and has acquired a record of 50 wins and 49 losses in doing so.\

 Occupation: Chuunin Examiner\
 \
 Anko Mitarashi is the proctor for the second exam of the Chuunin Selection Exams and leader of the Infiltration and Reconnaissance Party.\
 \
 Anko was once the student of Orochimaru. Later she, along with nine others, were branded with Orochimaru's first ten samples of the Cursed Seal of Heaven. Of the ten, Anko was the only one to survive, establishing the one-in-ten chance of surviving the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru supposedly rejected Anko as a subordinate, believing she did not have the lust for power or vengeance needed to fuel the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru lost interest in her, though he believed there was some value in letting her live. In the anime, after learning of her past, she was glad to discover that she wasn't tossed away like trash as she first had thought by Orochimaru, but chose to leave Orochimaru herself.\
 \
 Anko is easygoing, tomboyish, playful, stubborn, and sometimes hyperactive, making her very similar to Naruto Uzumaki in many ways. Despite portraying several \"Naruto-like\" habits, she has shown to be very knowledgeable and studious. \
 \
 However, she is also shown to have a bloodthirsty (in a literal sense) side, as shown when she scratched Naruto's face with a kunai, and licked away his blood. This probably comes from her time with Orochimaru. She regularly makes sure to have at least basic knowledge of the landscape for which her next mission will take place.\
 \
 As shown in flashbacks during the Land of Sea arc, Anko greatly admired Orochimaru while under his tutelage, seeing him as a role model and was inspired to be more like him. After being branded by Orochimaru with the Curse Seal, Anko became enraged and carried a deep loathing for her former teacher. From there on, Anko continues to search for Orochimaru in hopes of taking him down, feeling that it is her duty as his former subordinate to stop him, even at the cost of her life.\

Overhearing Zabuza as he told Haku that they were no longer in the afterlife, Gari informs them of their current situation, infuriating Zabuza because he didn't want to obey someone who would stoop so low as to use the dead. Ambushed by the Surprise Attack Division, Haku protects them both from the explosive tags carried by Sai's ink birds, but Zabuza calls it unnecessary once he observes the others regenerating.

 Minato Namikaze was the Yondaime Hokage of Konohagakure and the man responsible for sealing the nine-tailed demon fox inside Naruto Uzumaki when he was born. Doing so cost him his life, and before dying he asked that the villagers not see Naruto as the monster within him, instead wanting him to be viewed as a hero, a request ignored by the villagers. \"Namikaze\" translates literally as \"Wave wind.\" \"Minato\" translates as \"Harbor\" or \"Port.\"\
 \
 Minato shares a number of traits with Naruto, namely in appearance and attitude. Such comparisons are common throughout the first part of the series, and in the second as well. The second part of the series reveals that Naruto is his son, hence the comparisons, born to Kushina Uzumaki. In his youth Minato, along with two other unknown Genin, was a student of Jiraiya. Prior to becoming Hokage, he was also the sensei of Kakashi Hatake, Obito Uchiha, and Rin Nohara.\
 Minato is said to be one of the greatest ninja Konoha has ever produced, with natural talent that had not been seen in many years. He specializes in using the Hiraishin no Jutsu, a technique the Second Hokage, Tobirama created, which essentially allowed him to teleport to any location with the use of a special seal. By attaching the seal to a kunai or an enemy, Minato could teleport to the location of the seal unnoticed, allowing him to wipe out nearby opponents almost instantly. This ability led to his title as \"Konoha's Yellow Flash,\" and it caused him to be seen as so dangerous that a flee-on-sight order was given in regards to him during the Third Ninja War. He also created the Rasengan, a technique that does not rely on hand seals but instead uses a concentration of spinning chakra in one's palm that causes immense damage to its victim on contact. Later in the series it is revealed that technique is actually incomplete. Minato had planned to add his own nature manipulation training to the Rasengan, making it even more powerful, but could not manage to prior to his death.\
 \
 Later during the war he is resurrected by Orochimaru with Edo Tensei alongside all the deceased Hokage on Sasuke's demand. After Sasuke chooses to protect the village, he goes and joins the battlefield along with his fellow Hokage to help the Allied Shinobi Forces in their fight with the Juubi.\

 Shikamaru is an extremely unenthusiastic person, and as such lives his life avoiding work. This is partly due to him seeking paths of least resistance, as he often chooses to do things he would otherwise not do if people nag him enough. In his free time he typically takes naps, watches clouds, and plays strategy games such as Shogi and Go. When put into a situation where he potentially needs to put effort into something, he attempts to try to find a way to avoid it such as forfeiting a battle or by pretending to be preoccupied with something else. In the instances where he can not avoid these situations, Shikamaru tends to remark \"how troublesome.\"\
 \
 Despite his lazy tendencies, Shikamaru is extremely intelligent. His teacher, Asuma, found Shikamaru to have an IQ of over 200, and learned that Shikamaru's poor grades were a result of him finding lifting a pencil to be too much work for him. Nevertheless, Shikamaru works very well with his teammates, as their fathers were teamed together in their youth. Of his teammates, Shikamaru is closest with Chouji, who repays Shikamaru's confidence in him with unyielding loyalty. Shikamaru also has a strong bond with Asuma, often spending time with him playing strategy games. After Asuma's death, he even vows to protect Asuma and Kurenai's unborn child for his teacher's sake. Shikamaru has stated that he will make the child his apprentice someday.\
 \
 One of Shikamaru's more distinctive characteristics is that he finds all women to be bossy and \"a pain.\" Contrary to this opinion, he has expressed a notably mature interest in marriage and raising a family with a son and daughter. Ironically, Shikamaru seems to constantly find himself surrounded by the very same strong-willed and bossy women he dislikes. In addition to his own mother, and being surrounded by bossy females, he usually ends up fighting against such women. Shikamaru has had a number of his appearances coincide with those of Temari. When they make their Part II debut together, Naruto Uzumaki asks if they are on a date, though both Shikamaru and Temari state that this is not the case.\
 \
 When the need arises, Shikamaru is quick to abandon his lazy nature and act appropriately to complete a mission or save his teammates. Using his Shadow Imitation Technique, the signature technique of his clan, he can capture the shadow of an opponent to either keep them immobilized or force them to mimic his movements. This ability causes Shikamaru to frequently take the task of stalling enemies so that his comrades can get to safety or to simply buy time. Although this role puts him in a dangerous position once he can no longer stall the opponent, Shikamaru is willing to serve it, feeling that sacrificing his life to ensure the safety of his friends is worth it. He then considers every element that is relevant to the situation at hand and analyzes the information to its fullest, planning out a battle ten moves in advance and devising over a hundred strategies to use against an opponent. This combination of intelligence and dedication to his teammates causes Shikamaru to become the first of the primary Konoha Genin to advance to the rank of Chunin.\
 \
 Once becoming a Chunin, Shikamaru's father teaches him how to use his shadow technique more effectively, by using it to choke an opponent. This more interactive capability with his shadow is put to great use over the timeskip, and by Part II Shikamaru becomes proficient at using multiple shadow-based techniques at once. He is also able to manipulate his shadow to lift from the ground and either grab or throw weapons simply by utilizing an opponent's shadow for the same purpose. After he comes into the possession of Asuma's brass knuckles, Shikamaru learns to channel his shadow into them, using them to immobilize opponents by throwing them at an opponent's shadow to capture them and save himself the energy.\
 \
 Shikamaru goes to the Chunin Exams without a particular objective, not caring if he becomes a Chunin or not. In the finals he fights Temari, and would've won, but he decided to forfeit. During the invasion of Konoha, Shikamaru helps Naruto and Sakura to find Sasuke by staying behind and creating a diversionary ambush against the Sound Ninja who were pursuing them. Even though he forfeited the match, he was still promoted to Chunin, mostly because of his incredible way of thinking displayed throughout it. As a result of his early advance to the rank of Chunin, Shikamaru plays a considerably more active role in the plot than most members of the Konoha 11, albeit more indirectly than the primary cast. His first assignment as a Chunin is to assemble a team to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha, who has betrayed Konoha in search for Orochimaru to gain greater power. This forces Shikamaru's team to defeat Sasuke's escorts, the Sound Four. While his teammates defeat their enemies, Sasuke is able to escape, despite their best efforts.\
 \
 In Part II, Shikamaru is assigned to track down two members of Akatsuki. While he and his team manage to find their targets with relative ease, Akatsuki member Hidan is able to kill Asuma during the course of a battle. After Asuma's funeral, Shikamaru sets out with the surviving members of Team 10 and Kakashi to avenge their sensei. As his team deals with Hidan's partner, Shikamaru is able to defeat Hidan in memory of Asuma, and single-handedly weakens Akatsuki by one member.\
 \
 In chapter 649 of the manga, Shikamaru states that when Naruto becomes the next Hokage, Naruto doesn't have a smart brother willing to be his adviser like the first Hokage and there would be no better adviser for Naruto other than him.\
 \
 Years later, Shikamaru married Temari and have a son named Shikadai.\

He is rarely seen in either manga or anime, but when he is seen, he greatly resembles his son with the exception of his more matured appearance and the few scars on his face.  Nara Shikaku is the father of Shikamaru and the husband of Yoshino, and, like his son, he was part of an Ino-Shika-Cho trio, together with Choza Akimichi and Inoichi Yamanaka. Like his son, he is the Shika in the group name. He is married to Yoshino Nara who, as his son says, has him whipped. Despite his claim that \"a woman is always tender to the man she loves,\" his son is never convinced. As a member of the Nara clan, he raises deer, whose antlers can be used to make a medicine which halts the destructive effects of the Akimichi clan's three colored pills. Since his son became a Chunin, Shikaku has taken a great interest in Shikamaru's training as he knows his son has much greater potential than he gives himself credit, regularly playing him at shogi to further refine his son's intellect and teaching him more of their clan's secret techniques. He is probably the most skilled strategist and shogi player in all of Konoha, he beats Shikamaru on a regular basis. \
 When he is first seen, he is portrayed as a bit of an alcoholic, and at times uses some of Shikamaru's catchphrases (\"What a drag\" in English, \"How troublesome\" in Japanese). Like his son, he thinks that women should be tender and sweet, but as his son says, his wife has him whipped. Also like his son, he is a very lazy person, but he is also quite caring, and is ready to jump into action when needed. Unlike his son, his resolve is much stronger, as even during the most depressing or dangerous of situations, he has shown to maintain great determination and understanding as shown from how he has repeatedly helped his son regain his sense of worth. He also seems to be very smart as he has defeated Shikamaru in shogi. \
 \
 Like his son, and the rest of his clan, Shikaku uses a special secret clan type of Jutsu, that utilizes the manipulation of shadows in various combatable ways. Although he has only been seen in combat once, as the head of his respective clan, it is highly presumed that he has mastery of his clan's techniques. During Orochimaru's invasion of Konoha, Shikaku perfectly used the Shadow Neck Bind Technique against three opponents at the same time. \
 \
 He has also shown on several occasions to be a very intelligent man, repeatedly giving insightly words of advise to his Shikamaru, as well as repeatedly beating him in shoji, strongly hinting at having an intellect that surpasses his son's.  Shikaku's intelligence and skill as a ninja, has also earned him the position of Jonin Commander - the highest-ranking position to which a normal Shinobi can be promoted.\

 Orochimaru is a major antagonist of Naruto series. He is a missing ninja from Konohagakure, who is recognised as one of the most powerful ninjas and known as one of the \"Legendary Sannin\" (Legendary Three Ninja), which was a title that was given to him and his former team mates, Jiraiya and Tsunade, by Hanzō during the Second Shinobi World War. His main goals are to capture Uchiha Sasuke as his new body to gain possession of the Sharingan and to destroy Konoha.\
 \
 <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Background</b></div>\
 \
 From his childhood days Orochimaru was identified as a genius shinobi and a once-in-a-generation prodigy. His parents died when he was young and according to Jiraiya, Orochimaru's goals, which were quite alien to the ideals within the village, were associated with these painful memories.\
 \
 He was a student of the Third Hokage, who recognized Orochimaru's natural talent and often told Jiraiya to be more like Orochimaru. The Third was aware of a malice and a lust for power within Orochimaru, but chose to pretend not to notice and hoped that he could quell this part of Orochimaru's personality.\
 \
 Orochimaru's desire for power grew as the years went by. One day while visiting his parents' grave he found the shedded skin of a white snake. As the Third Hokage explained, it was known to represent good forture and luck which inspired Orochimaru. He began to study kinjutsu (forbidden techniques) and became obsessed with learning all ninjutsu that exists in the world.\
 \
 After leaving Konoha, Orochimaru joined an elite criminal organisation called Akatsuki. What he did while he was a member of the organization is pretty much unknown. The only information that was revealed is that his partner was Sasori and he made an attempt to take control of Uchiha Itachi's body to gain the possesion of the Sharingan.\
 \
 \
 After a failed attempt to take over Uchiha Sasuke's body, he was absorbed by Sasuke who didn't want to give himself up to a weakened Orochimaru. During Sasuke's later fight with Itachi, as Sasuke was too weak to suppress his chakra, he managed to escape and tried to take over his body once again, however was trapped in an inescapable dream-like realm by the legendary sword of Totsuka used by Uchiha Itachi.\
 \
 He was resurrected by Uchiha Sasuke during the Fourth Shinobi War, who used Anko's cursed seal and a piece of Kabuto's flesh to bring him back. After his resurrection, he reabsorbed the chackra Kabuto stole from him and revealed that he doesn't have enough power to take over Sasuke's body and has no interest in the war.\

Ranmaru became lonely after a while. Not long afterward, Raiga arrived in the course of a mission, and was planning on killing Ranmaru, but Ranmaru revealed his ability and his perception of the sorrow within Raiga. \
 \
 Raiga then carried him on his back, allowing Ranmaru to see the outside world. After Raiga's defection, he and Raiga enslaved a town and forced its villagers to work in its mines, also assembling some followers (including Karashi) to form the Kurosuki family. \

 Konohamaru named after the village he lives in: Konoha, is the grandson of the Third Hokage and by extension the nephew of Asuma Sarutobi. Konohamaru usually hangs out with his two friends, Udon and Moegi. Together, they call themselves the \"Konohamaru Corps\" (\"Konohamaru Ninja Squad\" in the English dub). In Part II they are teamed together under the leadership of Ebisu, Konohamaru's former tutor.\
 \
 At the start of the series, Konohamaru feels unacknowledged due to his status as the Hokage's grandson. As such, he frequently attempts to defeat his grandfather in battle so that he can become Hokage himself and earn the recognition he desires. Once meeting Naruto Uzumaki, Konohamaru realizes that he can't become Hokage by simply attacking his grandfather and will need to train hard to accomplish this goal. To help him in this regard Konohamaru begins to view Naruto as a role model, acquiring his determination, fiery attitude, and unique way of ending sentences, \"kore\" (コレ, a laughing signal or appreciation), much like Naruto's \"Dattebayo!\"\
 \
 Konohamaru's most obvious acquisition from Naruto's influence is his perverted habits, specifically the perverted jutsu he uses. After their first meeting Konohamaru becomes Naruto's disciple in an attempt to learn the Sexy Technique and defeat his grandfather. After mastering the ability he begins to train to create his own perverted jutsu, and after learning the Shadow Clone Technique in Part II he is able to create a smaller version of Naruto's Harem Technique. He has named his variant the Sexy: Double Knockout Girls Technique (おいろけ・女の子どうしの術, Oiroke: Onna no Ko Dōshi no Jutsu), which transforms himself and his shadow clone into nude women in a suggestive embrace. Because this jutsu is only effective against men, he also creates the Sexy: Double Knockout Guys Technique (おいろけ・男の子どうしの術, Oiroke: Otoko no Ko Dōshi no Jutsu) to turn into nude men in an equally suggestive embrace.\

 Genma Shiranui replaces Hayate Gekkou as examiner of the main matches of the Chunin Exams after Hayate is killed. \"Shiranui\" means \"phosphorescent light\". Genma is often seen with a senbon in his mouth. He uses this as a weapon, spitting it out at the enemy to attack them (It can reach up to 60mph), or to deflect ranged weapon attacks. When the invasion of Konoha begins, Genma battles Baki off-screen, presumably to a draw since both of them come out of the fight relatively unscathed. He later appears with Raido Namiashi to confront the Sound Four, who are forced to go level 2 of their cursed seals to defeat them. The Sound Four later comment that if it hadn't been for their cursed seals, Genma and Raido would have defeated them.\
 \
 Genma used to be Minato's personal body guard along with Raidou and Iwashi. In the ninja war arc, the three perform the flying thunder god jutsu to transport Mei to the main battle field. After doing this he cases after Lord Mu in the desert. \
 \
 Genma's three man squad consisted of Maito Guy, Ebisu and himself. Their leader was Chouza Akamichi.\

 Shizune is a jounin-level kunoichi of Konohagakure. She serves as The Fifth Hokage's attendant as well as her long time companion. She was Tsunade's apprentice, becoming a talented medical-nin under her tutelage. Shizune remains quite close to Tsunade, being one of the few people Tsunade would trust with absolute certainty. She was also appointed the captain of the Allied Shinobi Forces' Logistical Support and Medical Division.\
 \
 Shizune is the niece of Dan, the late lover of Tsunade. Some time after Dan died, Tsunade left Konoha, and Shizune went with her as her attendant and apprentice. The bond between Tsunade and Shizune is strong and, above all, Shizune sees her purpose in life as caring for Tsunade.\
 \
 Unlike Tsunade, she is level-headed, practical, and a rational thinker. As a result, she is the one who tends to stress over details, such as Tsunade's tendency to gamble and to think with her heart. She often gets comically worked up over any irrational decision Tsunade makes. Shizune also looks after Tonton, Tsunade's pet pig.\
 \
 She's not the type to tire easily and is very energetic and efficient while acting in her capacity of Hokage's Assistant, often urging Tsunade to finish the paperwork in order to avoid mountains of unsigned documents later on. She is often seen asking Tsunade questions about what to do with the village and the shinobi on missions.\
 \
 Shizune is noted to be a very talented medical ninja, in Konoha rivaled only by Tsunade herself and Sakura Haruno, another student of Tsunade's. Her training has blessed her with excellent chakra control, which is the primary reason she was assigned to lead the sealing of the Three-Tailed Giant Turtle. She demonstrated her great medical knowledge when she lead a group of medics in healing Neji Hyuuga, even though she had only recently returned to the village after many years of wandering the world with Tsunade. This was again seen when she was put in charge of the autopsy Konoha performed on the Animal Path that Jiraiya had killed.\

 Tayuya (多由也) is a  kunoichi of Orochimaru's Sound Four. \
 \
 <b>Personality</b>\
 Tayuya is foul-mouthed towards most people, especially Jirobo, calling him \"fatty\", as he criticized her over it. She didn't think much of Shikamaru Nara as a leader, but as a weak, useless rat, who ran away when she used her Doki to attack him. Of the Sound Four, Tayuya was the only member to show a sense of morality, as she berated Shikamaru for sacrificing his teammates to bring back one person who voluntarily left.\
 \
 <b>Involvement in Plot</b>\
 \
 Invasion of Konoha arc:\
 \
 Tayuya made her first appearance with the rest of the Sound Four, erecting a barrier to keep others from interfering in Orochimaru's fight with the Third Hokage. She later escorted Orochimaru when he fled.\
 \
 Sasuke Retrieval arc:\
 \
 The Sound Four escorted Sasuke Uchiha when he decided to join sides with Orochimaru. When Team Shikamaru caught up with the Sound Four, they managed to take the barrel Sasuke was being carried in from her. While trying to take it back, she was confronted by Kimimaro, who threatened to kill her if she didn't deal with some of the Konoha ninja. She fought Shikamaru, but was repeatedly outmatched by his superior intellect. When she started relying on brute strength, she was almost able to kill him, but Temari arrived, and killed her first.\
 \
 \
 Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation\
 \
 In the anime, Tayuya was reincarnated by Kabuto Yakushi along with her Sound Four teammates during the Fourth Shinobi World War. She was able to fight against Shikamaru again. Despite losing even when her body was enhanced by her summoner, Tayuya quickly reconstructed herself and cast the Space&ndash;Time Technique Formula: Underworld Turnover to teleport herself and Shikamaru to another location where her comrades have brought their opponents to. They continue their battles with their enemies, switching opponents while Shikamaru comes up with an analysis. Tayuya reveals that even their defeats will not release the barrier. The Sound Four overwhelm the Konoha shinobi with the hatred they hold for them. Taking advantage of this, Shikamaru continues to bait their hate to lure Naruto to the barrier and break them free. Tayuya and her comrades decide to fight against Naruto, but were defeated before their souls return to the afterlife.\

He knew that Gatō would try to kill him, but couldn't afford proper protection. It was because of this that Tazuna hired Team 7 under the false pretense of protecting him from bandits (this was considered a C-rank mission, thus reducing the cost). Unlike most of his fellow citizens, Tazuna was brave enough to defy Gatō's interests, although he was perfectly aware of the consequences.

 Temari is the oldest child of the Fourth Kazekage, making her the older sister of Gaara and Kankuro. Temari is generally overbearing, if not crude, toward those around her, often not being afraid to speak her mind. One of the few things shown to intimidate her is her younger brother Gaara. She very rarely stays true to her normally tough, demanding attitude, when around the boy, due to the fear of Gaara's wrath. Temari does have a caring side, and is not above showing concern for others. She is often seen with Shikamaru. Temari is a keen analyst, and can easily deduce an opponent's strategies and weaknesses soon after a battle begins.  For actual combat she uses her giant iron fan that, in addition to serving as a makeshift club, can be used to glide upon in order to intimidate her foes.\

 Tonbo Tobitake is a Konohagakure Chūnin. Most of his face is wrapped in bandages and he usually has a cigarette in his mouth.\
 \
 He works under Inoichi Yamanaka in the intelligence core. He was taught by Mawashi Dokuraku, \
 \
 Tonbo, at first glance gives off a very collected and cool personality. He is described as being very confident in his abilities although not haughty enough to not acknowledge someone else's talent. He is also somewhat rash and quick-tempered by nature as witnessed when he roughed up Komaza to get his point across.\
 \
 \"Tonbo\" (蜻蛉) is Japanese for \"dragonfly\". Dragonflies are famous for their 360&deg; vision, which is ironic considering that Tonbo's eyes and upper face are covered with bandages. While \"Tobitake\" means \"lying [through] the bamboo\". A taketonbo (竹とんぼ) is a small bamboo toy that flies when spun between the palms of your hands. So Tonbo's full name could also mean \"flying taketonbo\".\
 \
 His favourite food is yakitori and grilled onigiri while his least favourite food is cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che.\

 A Chunin level ninja, Mizuki was a former teacher at the Ninja Academy. After Naruto fails to graduate from the Academy, Mizuki tells Naruto that there is another way to graduate, and tricks him into stealing the forbidden scroll of sealings for him.\
 \
 But as fate would have it, Mizuki shows up and pins Iruka to the wooden shack behind him. Mizuki then tells Naruto the truth about his past, the fact that he is the Demon Fox. Mizuki then attempts to kill both Naruto and Iruka, but luckily, Naruto uses the skill he learned from the scroll, Shadow Clone Jutsu, to create clones of himself which defeat Mizuki easily.\
 \
 After that incident, Mizuki was imprisoned in the Konoha Strict Correctional Facility. Mizuki later on leads a prison revolt and sends the brothers, Fuujin and Raijin, to Orochimaru. During his escape, Mizuki remembers back to when Orochimaru gave him a cursed seal after a mission in which he killed his comrade. He was defeated by Naruto's Rasengan.\
 \
 Mizuki is from the Village Hidden in the Leaves, and his technique is the Transformation Jutsu.\

 Tsunade is the granddaughter of the First Hokage. She is one of the legendary Sannin.\
 \
 After his failed invasion of Konoha, Orochimaru approaches Tsunade to get her to heal his arms. While she initially refuses, Orochimaru offers to revive Dan and Nawaki in exchange for healing his arms. Intrigued, Tsunade is left a week to consider the matter. Once meeting Uzumaki Naruto, Tsunade begins to remember the dreams of her two loved ones and how much they loved the village of Konoha. While she longs to see them both again, Tsunade ultimately is unable to bring herself to help Orochimaru, his hopes of destroying Konoha too strong to ignore. Determined to protect the village her loved ones held dear until the end of their lives, Tsunade battles with Orochimaru and eventually defeats him. Having accepted the title of Fifth Hokage, Tsunade returns to Konoha afterwards.\
 \
 Since becoming Hokage, Tsunade has primarily acted as a source of assignments, and mobilizes Konoha's forces when need be. In addition, Tsunade plays a large role in healing the more severe injuries that befall upon those she sends on missions. At the end of Part I, Haruno Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice.\
 \
 Tsunade's trademark ability is her inhuman strength, which is derived from her excellent chakra control. By storing chakra and releasing it at the point of contact, she can enhance her strength to the point where she can break through boulders with her bare hands.\
 \
 She is also an extremely talented Medical-nin, and can heal wounds that most others would consider impossible. As a result of her chakra control and her medical abilities, Tsunade has created a form of regeneration. So she really is near 50 years old, but looks like she were in her twenties.\

 \
 Background:\
 Itachi Uchiha is a missing-nin from Konohagakure, and a prominent member of Akatsuki, partnered with Kisame Hoshigaki. He is Sasuke Uchiha's older brother. \
 \
 Itachi is relatively popular among many fans of Naruto, often having ranked in the top ten in Shonen Jump magazine's popularity polls since his introduction. He was first ranked in the third character popularity poll ranked in 11th place. He was ranked 9th place during the fourth popularity poll, and 6th place in the fifth popularity poll. During the sixth popularity poll, he again was ranked in 11th place. In the last poll, he was ranked in 5th place.\
 \
 Itachi was born into the Uchiha clan and was praised by all as the best of his generation - a genius above all others. Even by the standards of the battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi's prowess far outshined all others. However, not even his family, friends, or teachers could understand him. When he was only 4, Itachi had already witnessed countless lives lost due to the Third Great Shinobi World War, which emotionally traumatized him and turned him into a pacifist. At age 7, he graduated from the Ninja Academy at the top of his class after only one year, mastered the Sharingan at age 8, passed the Chunin Exams at age 10, and became ANBU Captain at age 13. According to Madara Uchiha, Itachi also had a lover, whom he killed during the Uchiha clan massacre.\
 \
 He was praised highly by his father, who saw the family's future in Itachi, hence neglecting his other son - Itachi's younger brother, Sasuke. However, during this time Itachi showed great affection towards his little brother, Sasuke, and even encouraged his father to come to the Academy when Sasuke was enrolled, something their dad had otherwise forgotten, by saying that he would not go to an important mission, that would establish Itachi a place in the ANBU ranks, otherwise.\
 \
 When the Uchiha began planning to overthrow Konoha, Itachi, as an ANBU, was tasked with spying on the village. Knowing that a coup d'etat would only lead to another Ninja War, Itachi chose to spy on the Uchiha instead, passing on information to the Third Hokage and the other Konoha elders. After this he began to act strangely, not attending the clan meetings, speaking out against the clan, and becoming the prime suspect for the murder of his best friend, Shisui Uchiha. The clan lost hope in Itachi, and his father began shifting his focus to Sasuke instead. Meanwhile, the Third's attempts to negotiate a bloodless end to hostilities between the two parties were proving ineffective, so, against the Third's wishes, Danzo and the Konoha Council ordered Itachi to wipe out the Uchiha.\
 \
 Before the fateful night arrived, Itachi discovered the existence of Madara Uchiha, who was attempting to rekindle the flames of war in Konoha. In return for not attacking Konoha, Itachi offered to help Madara claim vengeance against the Uchiha for turning their backs on him decades earlier. Madara agreed. Itachi slaughtered his entire clan overnight, sparing only Sasuke. Sasuke's life was worth more than the village to Itachi, and he could not follow through with the orders to kill him as well. Instead, he made himself out as a villain, who had killed their innocent family only to test his abilities. By doing so, he wanted Sasuke to take vengeance on him and become a hero to Konoha, thus redeeming the Uchiha name. He tortured Sasuke with his Mangekyo Sharingan, and encouraged him to become strong enough to kill him and avenge their family. Hoping that his beloved little brother would someday be powerful enough to kill him, Itachi left the village as a traitor.\
 \
 Knowing that Konoha would still want to eliminate Sasuke, Itachi pleaded with the Third Hokage to keep Sasuke safe. He also threatened Danzo to not harm Sasuke or risk him revealing everything he knew about Konoha's secrets to enemy countries. Sasuke's safety was therefore secured, and Itachi returned to his original plan of becoming infamous for his slaughter of the Uchiha. \
 \
 Itachi joined Akatsuki in order to keep an eye on the organization, along with Madara Uchiha, in case either ever acted against Konoha, all the while planning for his death at Sasuke's hands. While a member of Akatsuki, Itachi was approached by Orochimaru, who tried to steal his body to gain the Sharingan. Itachi trapped him in a genjutsu and severed his left hand as punishment, forcing Orochimaru to flee the organization. Sometime after joining Akatsuki, Itachi later helped recruit Deidara, Orochimaru's replacement, by beating him in battle, after which Deidara swore vengeance again.\
 Personality:\
 Ever since his first appearance, Itachi had always been mysterious, and had acted as though he was hiding his true self. While flashbacks to his past showed that he was a compassionate brother and person, his later acts and claims made it seem that this was mostly just an act. But, surprisingly, he genuinely was the compassionate brother he had once claimed to be, although he hid this from the rest of the Akatsuki to protect Sasuke.\
 As a member of Akatsuki, he possessed incredible self-control of his emotions. He constantly displayed an emotionless personality. He only showed surprise when opponents proved more powerful or skilled than he had expected, and even then he didn't lose his composure. He did not possess any arrogance, and fully justified any statements he made about his power, even complimenting his opponents at times on their abilities.\
 \
 In addition to being an extremely powerful ninja, Itachi had equally impressive intelligence, and was shown to be very wise. He was exceedingly sharp and observant to any situation at hand, as he was rarely surprised or caught off guard. He also displayed great intuition, as he was almost never deceived and even then almost instantly realized the truth. Despite his status as a wanted criminal, and having murdered a significant portion of his family, Itachi took no enjoyment in violence or combat, instead preferring to avoid battle or, if this was not possible, end it as quickly as he could.\
 \
 Itachi's only initial interest was in Akatsuki's goals, and his only loyalties appeared to be to the organization and its members, seeming to put the organization's success and secrecy before everything else. As such, Itachi got along with his partner, Kisame, much better than most other Akatsuki members did with their own partners. Kisame appeared to have a deep loyalty to Itachi, immediately doing as he instructed and constantly looking out for his well-being. Itachi treated all of his fellow Akatsuki members to this same, more respectful personality, although his courtesy was rarely returned by the other members.\
 \
 However, when he was in a genjutsu duel during his fight with Sasuke, he cruelly claimed he'd only let Sasuke live so that he could take Sasuke's eyes and obtain his own Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, after which he then claimed the Uchiha clan had been nothing but tainted and evil, since many members would kill their friends to gain the Mangekyo Sharingan, and would take another Uchiha's eyes to make its power permanent. Once the genjutsu was released, he called it his true self, implying his calm, emotionless personality was also a facade. This persona was later revealed to be only an act to ensure that he would die by Sasuke's hands, his love for his younger brother being the fundamental aspect of his personality. \
 Despite his status as an infamous shinobi, his appearance was not the most intimidating, apart from the intensity of his eyes. While living in Konoha, he would regularly have a gentle and caring look in his eyes, especially directed towards his younger brother. After joining Akatsuki, he would regularly have a stern look to them. He was a fairly tall shinobi, whose basic appearance was very much like the rest of his clan.\
 \
 He, like all members of his clan, possessed dark grey eyes, and also had black hair that hung near his cheeks to frame his face. He also had the addition of a long ponytail in the back of his hair (which he obscured with his Akatsuki cloak after joining the organization). Being brothers, Itachi and Sasuke had a similar appearance, but with subtle differences. Itachi's hair color appeared slightly duller and with a softer flow to it, without the spiky style at the back. His skin was also slightly darker. Itachi's most distinguishing characteristics were the long pronounced creases under his eyes.\
 \
 When he lived in Konoha, his casual clothes would consist of a black shirt with a large Uchiha clan symbol on the back of it, and black pants with a weapons pouch strapped to them. When on duty, he would wear the traditional ANBU uniform, although he was never shown wearing a mask. As a member of Akatsuki, he wore the traditional Akatsuki cloak, and usually kept the center of it buttoned down. After his cloak was incinerated by Sasuke's Kirin during their fight in Part II, it was revealed that he still wore his casual clothes underneath it. Like almost all members of Akatsuki, he wore the headband of his home village, Konoha, with a line gouged through it, to symbolize his broken ties with the village (although, secretly, he was actually still loyal to his village).\
 Abilities:\
 Since a young age, Itachi's intellect and talent showed their brilliance in everything he did, as even his teachers said his progress hardly required any help. In the few battles he had been seen in since the start of the series, Itachi was shown to be an incredibly powerful ninja, and easily one of the strongest in the Naruto series, as demonstrated by his ability to easily defeat Deidara, Sasuke, Kakashi Hatake, Kurenai Yuhi and Orochimaru (twice), who themselves are considered amongst the strongest ninjas in Naruto. Being a pacifist, Itachi did not actively take part in battle, typically only acting in self-defense.\
 \
 Sharingan:\
 Being of the Uchiha Clan, and as noted by Kakashi, Itachi was a true successor of the Sharingan Eye. From a stationary position, he would study an opponent's movements with his Sharingan and respond accordingly, often with a genjutsu. He could cast a genjutsu by merely pointing at or looking at someone, and could similarly turn an opponent's genjutsu against them with Demonic Illusion: Mirror Heaven and Earth Change. Itachi had trained so much with his eyes that he had reached the stage where he could have his Sharingan activated the entire time, with minimal drain on his chakra levels. \
 \
 Mangekyo Sharingan:\
 Itachi possessed the Mangekyo Sharingan, which increased his already great power, and enabled him to use his most powerful techniques. With his left eye, he could use Tsukuyomi, a genjutsu that traps an opponent's mind in an illusionary world, torturing them for what seems like days in a matter of seconds.With his right eye he could use Amaterasu, a ninjutsu which allowed him to create a black flame that he could direct by moving his eye to burn through seemingly anything in its path, including fire itself. His final technique was Susanoo, a technique that manifested itself as a spectral being, labelled as the \"Raging God of Battle\" in the databook. It wielded the Totsuka Sword, an ethereal sword with the ability to seal anything it pierces into the gourd that serves as its hilt, and Yata's Mirror, a shield that can reflect any attack. Zetsu, a fellow Akatsuki member, stated that Itachi's mastery of the Sharingan, combined with the legendary weapons of Susanoo, made him invincible.\
 \
 Despite his mastery of the Mangekyo Sharingan, Itachi suffered greatly from its side effects. His eyesight would worsen after every activation of the Mangekyo Sharingan, and he would eventually go blind from its power, with his Sharingan forever sealed away. Itachi was so close to blindness that, by the time he activated Susanoo in his final fight, both Sharingan eyes had become almost blind, and had turned white. However, he was still able to perform his own Fūinjutsu in his last moments.\

 Iruka Umino is an instructor at the Ninja Academy, characterized by the distinctive scar across his face that he has had since childhood. The name \"Umino Iruka\" can be taken as \"umi no iruka\" (\"sea dolphin\").\
 \
 Twelve to thirteen years ago, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox attacked Konoha, killing many people. Iruka's parents were still out fighting the Fox and were killed. Iruka was dragged back for protection by an unknown ninja but wanted to stay where he was. After it was over, everyone in the Ninja Academy made fun of him and made him feel just like Naruto Uzumaki. He was always near the K.I.A. (Killed in Action) stone monument where his parents were listed and always cried. The Third Hokage would watch him and tried to cheer Iruka up. Mizuki was a close friend of Iruka back then and usually made him feel better, but he was just acting to get the Hokage's approval.\
 \
 Little is known about Iruka's abilities, but he is clearly proficient in the basic ninjutsu and genjutsu, seen when he disguises himself as an enemy ninja and menaces Team 7 as a pretest for the Chunin Exam. The anime filler episodes show Iruka using Sealed Bomb Square Release (方爆法陣, Fūbaku Hojin), which consists of setting an array of exploding tags and, once the target has entered, setting the tags to detonate if the target moves. Because this only applies to the target, meaning others can freely enter the array without harm, it is possible that Iruka is skilled in this area.\

 She holds the belief that the group is more important than any of its individual members. Because of this, she always tries to do what she thinks is the best for Konoha, even if it goes against the Hokage's or her opinion. She is also quite demure, but does not let this stop her from voicing her opinion. In fact, despite this, she is one of the few people able to put the Fifth Hokage in her place when she oversteps her authority. Like Homura, she is more militant than the Hokage she served under have been, and sometimes leans more to Danzo's point of view.\

 Kabuto Yakushi is Orochimaru's personal medic, assistant, and general right-hand man. Kabuto was found as a young boy by a chief medical officer of the Konoha Medical Unit Squad. The officer brought Kabuto with him back to Konoha and raised him as a son. Kabuto eventually began acting as a spy for numerous countries and organizations (such as Akatsuki) before coming under the servitude of Orochimaru. Kabuto has since used his various former affiliations as a means to gather intelligence on Orochimaru's behalf, such as entering the Chunin Exams as a Konoha ninja to gather information on his fellow participants for Orochimaru's use. Despite his apparent loyalty to Orochimaru, Kabuto's true personality is difficult to discern; he frequently switches from a lighthearted and polite teenager to a twisted and sadistic maniac that enjoys playing mind games with his opponents. While he generally obeys Orochimaru's orders, he is not above healing Orochimaru's enemies or trying to strike up polite conversations with Naruto Uzumaki when they meet. Orochimaru himself seems to have a hard time determining Kabuto's thoughts, and has suggested that Kabuto secretly works against him.\
 \
 Kabuto is a talented ninja, being compared to Kakashi Hatake in ability on more than one occasion, as well as being shown capable of killing ANBU members with relative ease. The bulk of Kabuto's fighting ability lies in the medical jutsu taught to him by his adoptive father. These abilities have been further enhanced through his allegiance to Orochimaru, as he has been able to experiment on others to increase his medical knowledge. As a result, Kabuto is able to reactivate dead cells in a concentrated area and grow new ones. While he uses this ability in battle to immediately recover from attacks, it can also be used during his experiments to keep test subjects alive for much longer than is feasible. Kabuto can even temporarily reanimate a corpse for use as an ally or a decoy. During his battle with Tsunade, she remarks that his fighting and healing abilities surpass her own when she was his age. Despite his talents, Kabuto has always served others, a fate he is dissatisfied with. As such, after Orochimaru's defeat, Kabuto integrates his master's remains into his body as a means to become more powerful and to no longer be the mere tool of others. The remains have since begun trying to take over his body.\

 Ino Yamanaka is a childhood friend of Sakura Haruno who was bullied due to her large forehead, ending when Ino befriended her. She acted like a mentor, being tougher and more confident. Under her influence, Sakura began to develope her own identity. Though close to Ino, Sakura could not help but feel she was in her shadow and upon learning they liked the same boy, ended their friendship so that they could compete for his affection, beginning a bitter rivalry. Ino shed her tomboyish look in retaliation and was more open about her feelings towards Sasuke. The rivalry stays till the Chunin Exam. Nevertheless, they have a competitive relationship. She became somewhat superficial, thinking highly of her looks and has no problem telling people what she thinks, no matter how hurtful, such as telling Choji that he should focus more on his appearance because girls dislike overweight boys. On the surface of things, both of her teammates fit the profiles of people she wouldn't associate with because of her apparent shallowness, but she actually cares deeply for their well-beings and maintains a strong bond with them. It should be noted that while Ino is portrayed as shallow she came to Sakura's aid in the Forest of Death despite their feud. She cares very much about her friends, showing deep loyalty.\
 \
 As a member of the Yamanaka clan, Ino works in her family's flower shop and has become particularly talented in ikebana. She has been noted to be sharp upon occasion, such as noticing Asuma's affection for Kurenai or using chakra cleverly. The anime's filler arcs show that she's been able to find other uses for her time in the shop and can tell a person's profession by simply glancing at the condition of their hands. Being a Yamanaka has also shaped the mind-altering jutsu she uses. With the Mind Body Switch Technique, Ino can transfer to another's body and use it for a time. The anime explains her medical abilities. During the final filler arc, Ino finds herself of no use to her teammates and becomes awed of Sakura's skills. As such, Ino becomes Tsunade's second apprentice, hoping to be more useful to her friends. The anime has also shown that Ino has developed her own inner-self named \"Inner Ino\". She, along with team 10 plus Kakashi, aids in the dispersion of two of Akatsuki's members.\

Inoichi is a member of the Ino-Shika-Cho trio, which consists of three Jonin from the Yamanaka clan, the Nara clan, and the Akimichi Clan, respectively. His daughter, Ino, is a member of her own Ino-Shika-Cho, judging that their fathers were once team-mates themselves in their early days as ninja. \
 \
 Inoichi, presumably the head of the Yamanaka clan, has shown himself to be a highly capable ninja. He is well-versed in all of his clan's secret techniques. During the Invasion of Konoha in Part I, Inoichi skilfully performs the Mind Body Disturbance Technique  to make the invaders he encounters fight against their own allies without any self-control. Further proof of his skill was shown from his status as an interrogator during Pain's invasion. He was able to skilfully probe the mind of one Pain's Amegakure loyalist's, able to perceive a person's entire day of memories in under a minute, even though Pain had guarded it with mental blocks and traps. He has also shown the ability to communicate telepathically with his daughter, Ino.\
 \
 He is also skilled at tracking targets through their chakra trail, as long as the target's chakra signature stays the same. \

When his extensions are open and his head is visible, it is revealed that Zetsu has two different colored halves of his body, the left side completely white and the right side black. To go with this, Zetsu seems to have a split personality, as in the Japanese version of the manga the black half of his face speaks only in Katakana while the white side uses Kanji and Kana, and in the English episodes the black side has a different voice actor than the white side. The two halves also converse with each other, and occasionally differ in opinion (the black half is more serious and intelligent while the white half is carefree and easygoing). They also seem to communicate with their thoughts. To further his venus fly trap theme, Zetsu is a cannibal. \
 Zetsu is seemingly very trustworthy, being entrusted with knowledge of Pain and Tobi's identities. He has apparently been working with the latter for some time, Tobi first appearing as his \"subordinate\" and Zetsu later commenting that Tobi's plans have been in the works for a long time.\
 \
 Zetsu's main role within the Akatsuki is to function as a spy, often acting as a hunter-nin for Akatsuki. He has been shown able to move his body and take part in the tailed beasts sealing ritual imultaneously which, in addition to being unique to him, allows him to act as a lookout while the sealing takes place. When an agent to Akatsuki, or possibly even a member, dies, Zetsu is sent to devour their bodies so as to not have their secrets revealed. Zetsu is also the one sent to retrieve the rings of dead Akatsuki members. Due to the role he plays, Zetsu is the only member of Akatsuki to act without a partner on a regular basis. Despite this, Zetsu serves as a sort of superior to other members, as they often report directly to him instead of the actual leader, Pain.\
