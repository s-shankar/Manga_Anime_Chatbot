These mindless, towering giants, called \"titans,\" proved to be an existential threat, as they preyed on whatever humans they could find in order to satisfy a seemingly unending appetite. Unable to effectively combat the titans, mankind was forced to barricade themselves within large walls surrounding what may very well be humanity's last safe haven in the world. In the present day, life within the walls has finally found peace, since the residents have not dealt with titans for many years. Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert are three young children who dream of experiencing all that the world has to offer, having grown up hearing stories of the wonders beyond the walls. But when the state of tranquility is suddenly shattered by the attack of a massive 60-meter titan, they quickly learn just how cruel the world can be. On that day, Eren makes a promise to himself that he will do whatever it takes to eradicate every single titan off the face of the Earth, with the hope that one day, humanity will once again be able to live outside the walls without fear.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=629,  ["text"]="           \n    I was unsure if I would ever find another manga good enough to deserve my reviewing. And after reading volume six of Shingeki no Kyojin I can safely say the wait is over. What a manga!\nSTORY: 9/10\nThroughout the history of action manga there have been hordes of fantastically evil creatures ganging up on any shounen hero that dares get in their way. Whether it be demons, hollows, or demons again one thing was always certain: Even though the characters appeared scared you knew everything would be okay. A main character can't die to one random monster out of the horde. They deserve noble deaths via\n          \n        human vs human fights. \nShingeki no Kyojin abandons decades of stereotypes and does it in remarkable fashion. Never have I been so afraid, so physically frightened by \"just another mob of pure evil monsters\". In Shingeki the monster of choice happens to be giants. They don't have any special powers and in fact they aren't particularly massive considering they're giants. They walk, run, and even crawl around on the ground with blank, sometimes even silly faces and do nothing but eat and mangle every human in sight. This is something the mangaka has perfected despite the fact that this is the first manga he's ever written. Every single time a giant appears on the page your heart will start racing and your palms will become sweaty. Where do they come from and why do they devour humans despite having no anatomical need for it?\nThese are all questions the mangaka presents early and skillfully hasn't answered yet. He's also created an incredibly thought-out world with paragraphs at the end of most chapters explaining things that would bore readers if squeezed into speech bubbles. Including, but not limited to: three-dimensional flying gear, anatomy of a giant, construction of the cities three walls, battle formations, and a type of strange retractable sword. The world feels rich and thought-out and will almost certainly suck in anyone who gives Shingeki no Kyojin a chance.\nART: 8/10\nI'm going to be perfectly honest and say that the artwork in the first two volumes is as close to shit as it gets. Actions aren't drawn very well, details aren't drawn very well, and its clear the mangaka had trouble drawing body proportions. But when volume three started it was almost like a switch was flipped and the art wasn't nearly as bad anymore. In fact, after having just finished the sixth volume, its among some of the better art I've seen in a manga. Characters are drawn very different from one another and have a crisp yet visibly sketchy feel to them. And the Giants! They slide around with their giant heads, oddly proportioned bodies, and silly facial expressions just creeping the shit out of me. The mangaka is very talented at drawing characters experiencing the scariest moment of their entire lives. What a bonus the art became in volume three, adding fear on top of fear to make one of the most chilling manga experiences even more so.\nCHARACTER: 9/10\nEverybody is somebody. \"What's the point of writing about a character with no personality or back story?\" - Is what I imagine the mangaka asks himself before deciding to throw a new character into the mix. You'll find no blank-faced bad asses in this manga. You also won't find too many people with happy child-hoods either. Even though this is listed as a shounen it deals with very dark themes more suited for a seinen. Characters are often showed rattled and sometimes mentally scared from seeing their comrades get their heads bitten off in front of them. Either way, there is plenty of page time devoted to understanding characters and their roots.\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\nThe depth of the world is immense.\nThe art is very good (eventually).\nCharacters are deep.\nThe suspense is great.\nThe giants are TERRIFYING!\nIt's rare to find a manga that does so many different things so well. Whenever a new volume comes out I always know I'm in for another great experience I can't get anywhere else.\nOVERALL: 9/10\nI can't give a perfect score to a manga with so few chapters so early in it's life span. But trust me; if the same amount of enjoyment I've experience in the first six volumes continues throughout the rest of the series it would be a 10 no doubt. \nYou've gotta give this manga a shot. It's doing things that haven't really been done before, or at least not to this level. I'm setting the standard right now: You can't call yourself a fan of manga without reading Shingeki no Kyojin. Now get reading!\n*This review made possible by AironicallyHuman, who recommended this manga to me\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=308,  ["text"]="           \n    Shingeki no kyojin otherwise known as Attack on Titan. This series before the anime wasn't popular in the west, but it was fairly popular in Japan being in the top 15/10 best selling manga in 2011/2012. After the airing of the anime it became a mega hit series.\nNow before you give this review a not helpful vote because of the 10/10 score. At least read what I have to say before doing your deed. I'm more interested that you guys read my review than anything else. Now let's begin!\n\"Spoiler free review!\"\nStory: 10/10. The plot/story IMO is snk strongest point. \"Titans\" these monstrous looking creatures that\n          \n        comes in different shapes and size. Their main and only goal is to eat \"humans\" 100 years ago humans where forced to live Inside the walls which are over 50 meters tall, to stop the titans from getting in. This series is full of mysteries for eg. who or what created the walls? Are titans natural creatures? Who created titan shifters? Why were they created? This is just a small dose of the amount of mysteries in snk. Snk is a mystery series with horror elements in it. The plot/story is snk strongest point, but it can be a disadvantage to the series itself. Why? Because the story is setup in a way where it doesn't spoon feed you answers right away, and if the readers don't pay attention to the story. They will forget things that were earlier \"foreshadowed\" also the series being a monthly manga doesn't help. A lot of complaint I've heard about the series is that it feels like the author is making up things as it goes or pulling things out of his ass. Now this isn't the case. Snk is one of those series that gets better when you reread it. When you reread the series you will see the amount of foreshadowing/hints the author puts in the early chapters of the series. Things that has been foreshadowed in the very first volume is now being answered currently in the latest chapters of the manga. What does this tells you? It tells you that the author has planned out everything already, and he already knows how the story will conclude. The world building in snk is impressive! The amount of details the author puts in his world building is just great. Thd mysteries of the series and the overall plot is just so engaging. You just want to know the answers. This is one of the reasons snk has a lot of theory threads around the net. You know the TV series called \"lost\" that's the vibes I get from snk story. Except snk will answer our question and not give us any bullshit....I'm not going to go there. Anyways read over this series at least once. You will have a better understanding of the overall plot. And you will be less likely to ask stupid questions. Sadly not everyone is willing or have the time to read over the series. Sigh.\nArt: 8/10. You guys must be saying in your mind. \"what!? O.O 8/10 for snk art? fanboy alert!\" lol, let me explain why I gave it a 8/10. At first I didn't like the art. But I slowly started to like the art. The main reason is because the roughness in the art fits the horror theme very well In this series, I don't think the series would successfully have the \"horror\" feel to it if it had something like, the Levi spin off manga. I do have to say I don't think the art is as bad as people are making it out to be. I think the scan is mostly at fault for this, if you buy the actual volume you will notice it looks much better than the online scans. Compare crunchy roll scans with manga panda and mangastream scans you will see a difference in quality.\nCharacters: 8/10. A lot of people say snk characters are flat/one dimensional. You will also notice that most of the peeps that said it are anime only viewers. Now, the first 30+ chapters which is basically the 1st season of the anime are mostly use to introduce us to the big cast of characters. The author flesh out the 3 main characters which are Eren, Mikasa and Armin. The secondary characters are not shown too often so obviously the readers won't be too interested in them. And I'm not talking about redshirts characters I'm talking about the characters that we will get to grow with during the series. IMO. Armin and jean got the most development in the first 30 chapters, although they are both my least favorite characters. Now around chapter 35 is when the author starts to give focus on the secondary characters. And start to flesh them out more as in making us know their motives and also how they fit in the story/plot overall. There is a few more characters that needs some fleshing out/character development. But overall Isayama is doing a solid job with his character especially in a story driven series. About the female characters, I like how he balance it out as in making both the male and female cast both having important roles in the story.\n\nEnjoyment: 10/10.  This series is very enjoyable. Not only it has a great story but also it has plenty of action in it that gives me goosebumps. I also like how strategic the fights are in attack on titan especially when it comes to titan vs titan fight. There is no get angry enough and you will win type of fights. Female titan vs eren is a good eg. And I'm not talking about the anime filler with fire titan eren. Or power of friendship defeat the bad guys. If you don't stay calm and think logically you are going to lose. Finding weaknesses and exploiting them is what attack on titan fights are about. Eren vs armored titan is another good eg to that. overall I enjoy the living hell out of this series. The conspiracy, the mystery, the action/horror it all makes this series a series to remember.\nOverall: 10/10.  As I said before, if you want full enjoyment for this series. Re read it. If you are caught up and you're lost on the plot or you just feel you're forgetting things. Just reread it, pay attention and analyze everything. When you reread this series you will notice a lot of things you didn't notice the first time. Its also funny when you're rereading the manga and you know all the traitors in the series. You will also see how suspicious they were. Anyways time to wrap things up. Don't breeze through the chapters when reading it, take your time and enjoy the series for what it's. Whoever that has made it this far, thnx for reading! And I hope you have a wonderful day. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=289,  ["text"]="           \n    I will be concise. This review is based on the manga till the end of volume 3. \nShingeki no Kyojin is a unique manga, in that it is bears more of a resemblance to Western fiction than to Japanese fiction. In some ways, it is similar to Gantz, but overall it borrows heavily from western steampunk and fantasy novels.\nSTORY: 9/10\nEven though I'm only 3 volumes in, it is apparent that the story has immense potential.\nThe immense world around the small area in which the story is set is shrouded in mystery. Absolutely nothing can be guessed about it at this point. In the future, the\n          \n        manga will most probably involve revelations and discoveries about this world.\nIncidents in the protagonists' past are being gradually revealed. The main character seems to have some form of memory loss. While this may seem cliché, so far it has being handled well.\nThe author appears to have an extensive understanding of the world he has created, in the vein of JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth.\nIn addition, the steampunk technology used is fairly believable, and even explained at the end of chapters.\nI must confess the revelation of the main character's power took me completely by surprise. This leads me to believe that the author will handle plot twists very well.\nART: 7.5/10\nThe art, while not bad by any means, has a tendency to be slightly rough. It is completely hand drawn. The illustrations of the giants are quite impressive, and character design is unique. Backgrounds are some times less detailed, while distant shots of characters tend to be \"derpy\". None of this takes away from enjoyment.\nNote that the art has steadily improved through the chapters.\nCHARACTERS: 8.5/10\nThere is a multitude of characters besides the protagonists that may be important later on. \nCharacter emotions are handled quite well and are very believable.\nThe main characters all have rather engaging, if somewhat cliché personalities.\nSo far, there hasn't been too much character development, but this far in, that is only to be expected.\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\nAction scenes well done and never seem drawn-out. There is a fairly large amount of blood and gore. Story pacing is excellent. Never a boring moment.\nOVERALL: 9/10\nThis is definitely one for the long run.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=252,  ["text"]="          \n    What is the most valuable thing in life? \nIs it money, love, property, or something else? Well, everyone has his or her own ideas but for there's one thing we all have in common and that's the fact that we are all living beings that breathes in and out. We live by and enjoy life as best as we can. But what if that right is certainly put into jeopardy? What if a day comes when the place we live in no longer remains safe? Well, those are probably questions not many of us think about too often but for Mankind in this manga, those\n          \n        questions are people's heads every single day of their lives.\nUnfortunately, one day, some of those questions finally came with answers..in the worst way possible.\nShingeki no Kyojin (or by its more commonly known English title \"Attack on Titan\") is a Japanese manga written by Hajime Isayama. The series takes place in an alternative setting of the middle ages, a dark times when mankind is threatened by the appearances of giants. The human population is in jeopardy and often times, fear fuels both hatred and determination to live and eradicates the titans that threatens their very lives every day.\nWell for starters, I am pleased to say that Shingeki no Kyojin is a great manga to have in almost anyone's collection. I am not very familiar with the author. However, what I am familiar with is the way he presents his piece of work. By the name of the title \"Attack on Titan\", one may assume that the manga is related to a fantasy/adventure type genre series. Of course, you would be right if that was your assumption. However, this series marks more of a dark fantasy tale of horror and tragedy as from the very first chapters, we learn of the consequences Mankind starts dealing with. \nThe main character of the story is a young boy named Eren. Throughout his childhood, he has lived with his foster sister Mikasa Ackerman, his best friend Armin Arlart, and his mother. On the surface, readers may find his character to be impulsive, violent, and often or not acts without thinking. In other words, he is the type of guy that resorts to action rather than strategy. Unfortunately for him and his family, violence and action comes no less than from the giants. We are quickly introduced to a colossal titan from the very beginning as it makes history that levers the walls which stood between Mankind and the giants. Although not seemingly realistic, we can can imagine the people going through as the giants makes their way through and shattering the peace that Mankind has built for nearly a century. It is staggering and more so after these tragic events that would  change Eren and his life forever.\nLuckily, Eren seemingly follows a path of valor and plays the role of a protagonist rather than as a vengeful anti-hero. Although he displays his thoughts of vengeance at many times, Eren keeps his mind in check that what he's doing is for sake of Mankind and its existence. Speaking of which, Mikasa also plays her roles well. For a female character, she is very intelligent, resourceful, and independent enough to land some kills against the giants themselves. We can see easily that Mikasa plays the anti-thesis of the gender role from the middle ages as she displays superhuman like behavior throughout the manga. \nThe other characters throughout the manga also gets their own development, spotlights, and in more mysterious ways; some that holds secrets where we may never have imagined them to be. Among these secrets involves the giants and Eren's identity. Speaking of which, at many occasions, the manga explores the theme of identity and what people sees themselves as. For example, Armin Arlart is often confused about his place as a member of the military. He often seems to blame himself as being useless despite his ability to help out others at crucial times that have saved the lives of his dear friends. Mankind itself also begins to mount resistance and making its race a name for the giants to fear. Every drop of blood is a loss for humanity and with population staggering, everyone tries to contribute their efforts against their ultimate enemy – the Giants.\nWell, that of course brings us to the very horror that started it all. The Giants.\nThe manga captures the horror of what Giants truly are. On the surface, they have humanoid-like  structure such as their facial features and similarly shaped body resemblance with the same amount. However, what they lack is empathy and seemingly exist for the purposes to kill. Rather than feeding, these Giants are the true adversaries and destroyers of Mankind. However at the same time, the series inspires mystery as to their origins and how they came to exist in such a world. Nevertheless, their behavior spells out more words than action as they live to devour humans and make Mankind a living nightmare. Among other factors, the titans are classified differently for variant types. There are the normal titans, armored titan, muscular titan, ape-like titan, hairy titan, and of course the Colossal titan that started the conflict all over again. They are true horrors and the executioners of Mankind.\nThe manga series adapts the medieval-like feeling well. At many times, we can see that Mankind really did put effort into creating the peace they desired. The outer later of Wall Maria stands tall and proud as it has outlasted over a century. Among other factors are the inner walls, cannons, and guns. Most curiously though is the usage of a device known as the Three Dimensional Maneuver Gear. The device functions as both a tool and weapon used against the giants for those who have enough skills. Those who truly wishes to protect Mankind and challenge against the giants enlists in the military for crude training against what they both fear and hate. \nAmong other things, there seems to be some symbolism throughout the manga. The walls stands for both a physical feature but also seems to symbolize the way Mankind seems to isolate themselves as an united race. Mankind knows that without cooperation, death will likely resurface and blood will be spilled. Then, there's the idea of survival of the fittest. If we look carefully, those who have the skills, intellect, and determination will have the potential to make it through. Those that are weak, reliant, and doubting themselves are the first to die. It is a cruel world and the giants themselves makes that world into reality.\nWhile the realism of the the series is a bit weak, I do find that horrors portrayed in this manga is well executed. The giants seems to lack motive to killing people but when they do, it always ends brutal that leaves behind both physical and mental scars. Some of these may never be healed. In more than one way, the giants plays the role of the super power as they strives to dominate against humanity. More curiously enough, not all of them are as mindless as we may think. But nonetheless, the giants are the horrors that mankind must deal with. The gore and violence presented gives readers a visually sense of just how serious the situation is. It's a cruel, cruel world out there.\nThere are many questions that needs answers still with this manga. However, by the way of Mankind's expressions, they are not very patient. This manga published by Kodansha is ultimately a piece of work that I enjoyed reading so far. There are some distractions occasionally with the gore and may frustrate readers with the mystery aspect of the work, especially in regards to Mankind's ultimate enemy. However, it has collected enough interests with the origins of its presentation, delivery, artwork, and for me is an enjoyable read. It's a horrific tale that questions how fragile lives can be in a world that rains of blood, terror, and destruction.\n[Note: This is my first manga review. Feedback is welcome]\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=191,  ["text"]="              \n     This review is up to chapter 45. \n\nFirst of all, if you haven't read Shingeki no Kyojin yet, go do it. I'm not usually this enthusiastic about shounen manga, but SNK has managed to become the exception, simply because it's so damn good. Why? What makes it better than other works in similar genres? Well, my little ones, SNK is  so  well thought out. Meticulously so. From the plot to the characters, everything has just that extra layer that pushes SNK to become an outstanding piece of writing. There are plot twists often, and boy, can they catch you off guard. All\n          \n        of the characters contribute to the development of the story and each other. I'm picky when meeting characters, and even though this manga has about 1,000,000 of them, it is easy to differentiate and love even the most minor. This is definitely a story that I would buy and read over and over until the pages are worn.\nAnd, well, as for the art.... There are some 'inconsistencies' that kind of annoy me - mainly that they way jaws are drawn from profile makes their faces look like tomato cans - but aside from minor things, it is a refreshing style. Isayama's art doesn't have \"copy/paste face\" - meaning that the only thing that physically changes from character to character is the eye size -- rather each character has their own specific features. It doesn't sound like that much to ask for, but this is regrettably rare for anime/manga. It's actually quite daring, and I can appreciate a good oasis in the desert of generalized faces. \nOverall, this is the kind of manga that makes you think. I've been reading for a long time, but never have I spent so much time going over possibilities and predictions in my head. Not only that, but you genuinely care about what's happening. It's the  kind of story that your jaw drops, your eyes widen, and your heart beat wildly with anticipation. And as for the fandom, it has an amazing range of artists, writers, thinkers, and crackifiers, and I enjoy every second of being apart of it.\nSimply put, Shingeki no Kyojin is fantastic; a regular 10/10 would bang. I'd recommend it to anyone, even people who don't read manga. Go. Go read it now. Then friend me so we can talk about it into the wee hours of the morning.\n        "},

Shingeki no Kyojin is one of the manga that caught me by surprise and I definitely love reading this.\nStory 10/10\nCompared to other manga dealing with the supernatural, giants as the main villain is already a very interesting choice. Maybe because giants, even as portrayed in this manga, dont really have special powers; they are just big, very very hard to kill and not picky at eating people. The great thing about this manga is that everything seems very realistic, apart from the existence of the giants. The\n          \n        story is set in a apocalyptic type situation where the last human colony faces giant attack threats constantly. After decades of unsuccessful threats on the giants, the characters in this manga are struggling with fear and hopelessness, they are neither heroic nor optimistic.\nArt 8/10\nI enjoyed the mangaka's style, it's gritty and at times, messy, but it sets the manga apart from the rest. The characters all have different features, so it's easy to identify them. However, the best part would have to be the way the mangaka drew the giants. They are so horrible and evil and ughhh... It makes you absolutely terrified whenever you see a giant in any page. And the deaths of all the people eaten by the giants were well drawn. ugh. And the expressions of fear and desperation in the characters' faces, makes you feel so bad for them.\nCharacter 9/10\nI love that the characters in this manga are portrayed realistically. None of the characters have the illusions of being heroic or optimistic. In fact, each of them are selfish in their own ways. After reading many shounen manga where the villains just wont die, it's hard to believe that the heroes can still remain confident and courageous (bleach's kurosaki, dgray's walker). And in this manga, you can see that the characters are just real people with no special powers or weapons, tired of fighting and seeing deaths around them.\nEnjoyment 10/10\nThis manga caught me right from the start. Maybe I just really like the dark, desperate kind of mood that this manga brings (reminds me of early d.gray-man). The villains, the giants, and evil and crazy and horribly terrifying, The main characters are weak, terrified people just struggling to survive. Amazing read.\nOverall 10/10\nI would recommend this to everyone. It is really amazing.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=162,  ["text"]="           \n    This new manga is topping the sales charts in Japan and I think for a good reason.\nI just started reading it (I am just into the second chapter) and I am already hooked.\nFirst let me spend a few words on the drawings. The backgrounds are quite nice and polished, but the characters, although nice, could be less \"noisy\".\nI think this kind of style is instead very appropriate with the giants (or titans). They are strange, distorted human forms with the skin of their faces revealing all their theeth in a wicked grin. Their body proportions are usually off enough to give them an even more\n          \n        monstrous appearence.\nThe faces of the characters are nevertheless pretty good at conveing emotions. \nThe characters' fear in the face of an impossibly stronger predator is well represented. Imagine if you were face to face with a monstrous 15 meters tall man with a wicked grin and the will to eat you...\nThis plays on our instinctive fears of predators. It's true that today humans are at the top of the food chain, but it hasn't always been like that.\nProbably if lions would evolve an intelligence they wouldn't know this kind of fear as they have no natural predators (normally), but for us the fear of being preys, of being helpless in front of a strong predator is something we can understand well.\nI don't remember another manga with such a strong emphasis on this aspect and this certainly is a good thing!\nThe only small complaint could be that the drawings quality is not always the best, but seeing how the series has just started I think the author has plenty of time to improve.\nI definitely recommend this series!\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=160,  ["text"]="             \n    So, here's my second review. And since I didn't like much the way I wrote the Psycho-Pass review, I'll change it. I'll just comment through all the aspects of the manga without having a \"separate category\", where I rate every single one. So, let's get into the review of the almost perfect manga, Shingeki no Kyojin - attack on titan.\n (Remembering this review goes only to the first 11 volumes from the manga. I will re-review Shingeki no Kyojin once the manga finished publishing)\nNote: Sorry if it is a bit incomplete or short. I tried my best not to spoil also, so don't worry if\n          \n        you haven't read the manga.\nShingeki no Kyojin (or \"attack on titan\"), is a historical science fiction/fantasy seinen manga series with shounen aspects written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. Let's first talk about the plot, which is definitely the best and strongest aspect of the manga. \nIt's a shame I can't give a plot summary here, because I would like to get a bit into the details, and also, I really don't enjoy going on talking about the plot without mentioning at least the basics. But what can I do? Well, the story at first to me looked cool and interesting, but as it develops more and more, mysteries appear and unimaginable things are revealed. This is what Shingeki no Kyojin did best: creating so many unresolved mysteries at the same time that we get a lot more interested on the story and keep reading. The narrative is constructed in a incredible way, and everything make us feel the despair and fear that the characters are going through while fighting the titans, also another strong point of the manga that we didn't see in the anime. \nThe characters are also very unique. Every character is different in personality, decisions and even the fear they feel. Also, it seems that every single one of them has a special role during the story, or everyone has a mystery behind their background story and such. Of course there are those one characters which have a bit more depth or carisma than others (of course other than the main Eren, Mikasa and Armin), like for example Corporal Rivaille and Sasha Braus, whom I believe a lot of people liked since the moment they appeared. Of course the background of some characters aren't developed a lot during the story, but that can't be a flaw, since the manga has not ended yet.\nAll the concept of the story is well made and can be explained. Every single thing. That is extremely good for every deep story that I read, and what lots of not only anime and manga, but movies, games, novels, etc; lacks sometimes. Things need an explanation at least. And those explanations and the current revelations that pointed me from the opinion of Shingeki no Kyojin was a supernatural/fantasy anime to my thoughts that the anime actually goes much more to a sic-fi genre. However, again, since the story isn't finished and lots of things haven't been resolved, I can't be sure of the genre yet. And that's only my opinion, there are people who still believe the manga to be supernatural.\nOne of the best things that I found about the story was also the deconstruction of typical shonen or even fighting-central seinen. There are few cliches during the manga, and when those appear, they are really well-used to increase the emphasis of something that happened or what someone is saying. \nAnd also, something that Shingeki no Kyojin does – or better, the author of the story – is the fact that it kind of doesn't care about deaths of characters, and that is seen very rarely in anime, as well as the censure, that is almost absent throughout the chapters. The deaths does not seem dramatic, but they somehow make you feel at least a bit of emotion, it doesn't matter who they were. But of course I won't get into detail on this part.\nAnd, as the story isn't finished yet, I cannot give my general opinions on the ending. But I can only tell that I'm always afraid of endings when I read ongoing mangas or watch ongoing anime. I always think: \"What if the ending is completely terrible? What if it ruins the anime/manga?\" But , I here can say that I have high expectations that this manga will have a great and well-thought ending. I hope the author doesn't mess up during the ending of the series.\nWell, now we go on to the art. Well, this is where the manga fails. The art overall is not good, that being because the artist probably is beginning. There are huge anatomy flaws on lots of scenes, proportion mistakes and such things. Also, the shading done in the manga is not the best, and I didn't like much the way Isayama inked the black parts of the pages, those being normally a bunch of lines. However I know that it may be hard to do 50 pages a month, so he probably does that to make it in time to publish. That being, the fight scenes including humans using the DMT aren't really well drawn, however nothing that disturbs the eye of those who read the manga. \nBut the flaws on the art are only for the characters (humans). The titans are overall pretty good and odd – on a good way – drawn and they vary much in forms, sizes and even their faces are almost all different from each other (some titans with beard, others with chubby creepy faces, and some of them are made to look badass – you that already read through good part of the manga probably know what I'm talking about).\nAlso, the art out stands on the scenarios, that are without doubt one of the best out of all manga I've read. It is definitely the most obscure and dark one of today's good manga, with the whole titan story and the mysteries that the plot presents to us. However, I still am not sure if the artist had his assistants draw part of the scenario or not. Even if that's the case, the creativity he had to design everything – the walls for example – is just insane. \nThe fact that the manga presents lots of mysteries is the key to its full enjoyment. You will keep wanting to read more and more, because, well, you want to find out what the freak is happening, and as more unresolved things appear together, you keep wanting more to read. Until you reach the manga's last chapter, and have to wait one month for it to be posted around in some website.\nThe enjoyment, unlike lots of other series, isn't made by the comedy, which is practically absent on the entire manga, and when it happened, of course it was on the calmest moments, where the characters could kind of just relax. And normally when Sasha's around, since she is that typical character on a serious story that is used to relieve a bit of the stressful atmosphere around the other characters, but that as well have her serious moments. The comedy is even funny, probably because of the lack of it.\nOverall Score: 9.3/10\nShingeki no Kyojin is the best manga being launched during this time without a doubt, and it probably holds one of the best stories I have seen on an anime or manga. The manga presents only one flaw: the art. Don't get me wrong, I don't really think art is super important, however, for mangos with epic stories and intense, fast-paced fights, it is almost mandatory. It doesn't ruin the manga, not even a bit, because of the awesome story that it presents. Its enjoyment is outstanding, characters very good and almost everyone that I know who read the manga say to be one of the best from today's time and, of course, recommend it to others.\nSo, as a final speech, I strongly recommend to all of you Shingeki no Kyojin, both for the ones who want a more serious thing instead of constant comedy, cliche romance and nonsense fighting, and also, I recommend for the boys/girls who only read shounen. I suggest you to go read the manga, because most people who read and watch shounen will like this. \nSo, this was my review of Shingeki no Kyojin. Until my next review, \nNuclearNecro-42, signing off, and going back to Ishimura."},

Shingeki has several mysteries that intertwine as one reads the series--how the Titans were made, exactly how they work, who is controlling them, what's that huge monkey, and a few other that are secret--and I think the fact that it isn't eleven volumes of pointless bloodshed that makes the series so\n          \n        popular.\nShingeki also has some good character development--hardly any live character stays the same, for better or for worse. Each character has their own story and personality, and te mangaka is good at revealing them.\nThe artwork isn't gorgeous, but I think it's a good fit for the series. If Isayama Hajime used a beautiful art style, I'd think it's be distracting.\nFor those who find the series too graphic, I'd say the anime toned it down a lot.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=154,  ["text"]="              \n    Shingeki No Kyojin has just recently started airing as an anime this season and is the most hyped up show that is currently running. I got into the manga about a month before the anime started to see what it was about. I haven’t read too many manga so far, but I can still feel like I want to write a review about how spectacular this manga is.\nI’ll address the few downsides to this manga before explaining each of the parts individually. First, this manga starts off a little slow. It goes in a slightly different, less chronological order than the anime, with more jumping\n          \n        around to different times and some flashbacks. Once you get into it and get used to the huge character cast who keep dying and getting replaced by stronger, more important, and longer lasting characters, it gets easier to understand. The other problem this manga suffers from is that with the huge character cast, the character designs for some characters are fairly similar and sometimes cause you to forget which character is which. This problem ends eventually though when the manga starts to focus more on the important people and less on the massive amount of death fodder characters.\nPlot – 10/10\nThe plot is amazing. As you probably already know, the plot of Shingeki No Kyojin is about humans who have been forced to retreat behind a set of three walls and several smaller settlements next to them for over a hundred years. Titans, beings whose shapes are similar to humans’ who range from 3 meters to even one that is 60 meters tall (really fucking tall if you don’t know metric like me). For hundreds of years, the humans have survived inside the walls without the titans ever breaking through, but that’s where the story begins. One day when, five years prior to where the main events of the story begin, the 60 meter titan appears outside of the wall of the settlement where the three main characters (Eren, Mikasa, and Armin) live and breaks through the wall letting smaller titans into the settlement and producing mass chaos and lots and lots of death. Some people manage to escape, but the titans have already taken over and forced the humans to retreat behind the next of the three main walls. From there, the story jumps ahead a few years to when the main characters are joining the military and then graduate. From there, the story really gets going, but I won’t spoil anything else. It only takes about five chapters to get really into the plot. Having just caught up to the manga at 44 chapters earlier today, I can tell you that after Chapter 30 readers are in for a huge plot twist ride especially after Chapter 40. These twists really catch you off guard but are not bad in the slightest.\nArt – 9/10\nAs I mentioned, some of the characters designs are somewhat similar. So far, the anime, which adds color especially to hair to help differentiate between brown and black hair, seems to have fixed this problem. The other problem is that some fights, especially using the 3D maneuver gear which is the main weapon used to kill titans, is so intense that it is clearly not something still images can convey as well as the anime has so far. The art is still great, but the task of drawing these action scenes is just too much sometimes. Still it does succeed in capturing the emotions of the characters, especially when they are horrified, which happens a lot.\nCharacters – 10/10\nEventually this manga slows down the amount of death fodder characters and gets you more into the main ones who are great characters. Eren, the main protagonist, is a boy bent on killing all titans and getting revenge for the loss of his mother when the titans first broke through the wall several years ago. Mikasa is Eren’s friend and the strongest fighter in their graduating class from the military. She is always looking after Eren and doing everything to protect him, and he does get into a hell of a lot of trouble. Armin is Eren’s other childhood friend. Unlike Eren and Mikasa, he is not a good fighter though he excels in strategizing. Personally, I think Armin may be my favorite character, though I think a lot of people like Mikasa the best. Some other notable characters are Rivaille (or Levy) who is the strongest fighter in the whole military and can take down dozens of titans single-handedly, Sasha (aka \"Potato girl\") who likes food and is also a great fighter, and Annie who excels in hand-to-hand combat, and Reiner who is very muscular and always wants to protect everyone he can. While some characters may not seem very important at first, many of them have things they are hiding and pasts that have not yet even been fully explained at 44 chapters. You emotional connection you get with these characters can hurt you sometimes if a character you like a lot dies, but others live on draw you into a strong connection with them instead and never cease to amaze you.\nEnjoyment – 10/10\nI’ve been reading this manga somewhat slowly for the past couple months, but just today I read from Chapter 31 to 44 almost all in one sitting. Once this manga really gets going, it draws you in and you better be prepared for this thrilling, gory, twisted ride that I highly recommend to everyone who enjoys survival horror or action manga.\n        "},

You shouldn't think about or doubt it while you're reading it; just keep reading and enjoy the actions, plot twists, and deaths. If you take too long to read it, the plot will become nonsense. \nAttack on Titan is highly enjoyable. It doesn't have fan-service to distract you, no 30 chapter long fight scenes, nor does it drag on about the importance of friendship and other garbage that shounen mangas force you to worship. It's flat out action with \"kill or be killed\" perspective. The fights are thrilling, the deaths are emotional, the\n          \n        plot twists are surprising, and the setting is mysterious. \nThe manga tries to keep it real: humans are fragile, corrupted, greedy, and mostly selfish. I guess that's the selling point of this manga. Where you have characters shooting beams out of their mouth in most mangas, here is an action manga that actually shows that humans are not invisible. It doesn't matter if the character is major or minor, death is an inevitable fate, and the mangaka doesn't hesitate to kill his characters. Death isn't glorifying, it's not sweet, it's not fun, and for a soldier, it definitely isn't welcomed. This is where the enjoyment hits the peak, the idea that a death in battlefield is anything but important. The war goes on and lost ones are replaces. Some rue, some forget. But the courage to fight knowing dismal rates of survival is truly heroic and when the protagonists achieve victory, you can feel it. I guess this part of Attack on Titan is what I enjoy, it's keen details on death, human nature, and sacrifice. \nNow, I told you to read it as quickly as you can. Why? The plot is a mess. It lacks originality and logic. The whole idea of monsters invading humans and fighting monsters with monsters is copied from Claymore. It's sad just how much it borrows from the older series. The concept of corruption, mysterious setting, and grand conspiracy all comes of Claymore. I can go on about every little thing Attack on Titan borrow (copies) from Claymore, but it would be a disappointing experience. \nThe other thing wrong with the plot is its inconsistent pacing and explanations. The author tried to put too many ideas into one story; it's just a big mess. It has come to the point where the author is contradicting himself and pulling out explanations out of the blue. And as each chapter moves on, the only thing interesting to happen is character deaths.\nCharacters, like the story itself, is also copies. Hot-headed young man with power trying to pursue goals with help of childhood friends under a prodigy lieutenant in an organization full of conspiracy that is somehow related to the character's father...yes, it's Fullmetal Alchemist all over again. There is just nothing to speak about them, no originality whatsoever. \nI can't give it a 10, 9, or 8. It's not creative, not original, nor full of intelligence. It doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's a mix of Claymore and Fullmetal Alchemist set with an apocalypse setting. It's not qualified for a 7 either. But it's enjoyable. It's fun to read. I appreciate the author's effort to portray the dark themes, and he executes them well. And with a sketchy, unique, and not-moe art style, the author deserves a little praise. \nAs I said, read it quick, appreciate the intense setting and action. Appreciate the twists and turns. Be overwhelmed by the titans and their actions. Be anxious about the culprits, be thrilled by the conspiracy. Just don't think, don't compare, that's the best way to enjoy this manga. \nOverall: 6.25\n\n\n"},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="               \n    This is my first review ever. Also english is NOT my native language.\n\nShingeki no Kyojin also known as Attack on Titan by Hajime Isayama is one of the most popular and best-selling manga of all time, it has an anime adaptation by the same name, tons of spin-offs and tons of yaoi fan fiction. Some may say it's a genius work of art, others may say it went too far. Judging by my score, you probably already know my thoughts on it.\nThe story revolves around our main character, Eren Jeager, in a world where the remaining humans were living surrounded by huge walls, to protect\n          \n        themselves from gigantic creatures, known as the Titans. This epic tale is about humanity's fight against the titans to regain the lost territory, while unfolding some of the secrets regarding the Titans along the way.\nWith such a simple premise and structure, but yet amazing story, SNK relies basically on shock factor to keep its narrative interesting and it's audience entertained, revealing more and more about its world and characters. The story itself is just amazing, world building is perfect, and the steam-punk setting makes it even better, the mysteries and plot twists make the story even more engaging to read. Attack on Titan's story is superb, I can guarantee you that some plot twists will take you by storm.\nThe characters are simple, but yet memorable. Their personalities can be pretty much resumed to stereotypes (the intelligent one, the energetic one, the cold-blooded one) but they do get proper development later down the line (most of the cast, not only the mains). The emotions of each character are perfectly translated, their goals are established very early on, each one of them has a tragic back story, making the characters pretty memorable. But what I really love about the characters are the plot twists regarding their past, which will shape their personality later on when the story progresses and justify some suspicious and questionable dialogue and actions.\nI really can't comprehend what problems people have with Isayama's art, I really don't. The rough artstyle fits the narrative perfectly and, although i must admit that the art may look a bit ugly to look at, it does improve a lot, and it hasn't really bothered me in any way. People tend to say the art is horrendous, but they are just overeacting really.\nLoved the series, one of my favorite manga of all time. Most of the plot twist were unpredictable and the way the story slowly escalates and the author reveals more and more information to us about the world and the characters, it becomes a really enjoyable series, and it's just getting better and better at each new chapter.\nGo read it, if possible, it definitely will surprise you how amazing this manga really is, every about it pretty much perfect, and although it might have some flaws here and there, it will for sure be an amazing experience.\n        "},

There is a good reason why it is such a popular manga both in and outside of Japan. It is an excellent manga if you are starting to read manga, since it\n          \n        shows people that manga is not only for children. The slow pace might turn off some people, but it pays off with nice character development and immense action scenes that will leave you craving for more.\n        "},

Although there is nothing wrong with that, i will mention something of valuable importance.\nAlthough many agree, alongside me that the manga is great. There is a dynamic story with a great fluid pace and very decent art-style. The characters are very engaging and each chapter grips you like an electric wire on a pool.\nOk that made no sense, but the content in the manga is really SHOCKING (in a good way), see what i did there?, no, okay.\nAnyway\n          \n        my main point to raise, is that although the manga is very good and has a consistent delivery of information. \nThe chapters, 80+ really shine the most.

Does it earn it's colossal praise? Yes, if you don't mind depressing politics mediocre to average art or ambigous morals. The story and world-building was great; I really liked how in-depth how the author provided factoids about how the 3dmg works, and how titans work. The realism on how the characters react to the horror the series presents. Many characters that seem archetypical (Armin, Sasha, Christa, Eren) are far more than just that, especially Christa, she built immensely as a character. Some problems of the\n          \n        series are the plentiful cliffhangers, sluggish pacing, and not that great art. Overall, Atrack on Titan is a solid series with a colossal bite.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="          \n    Eren and Mikasa live in the Shiganshina district of a huge walled area where what is left of mankind live. What happened to the rest of humanity? Giants have come and started eating them for fun (I know, right? They must have pretty bad indigestion). This is a time and place where luckily (or maybe unluckily for them) there aren’t any of those distastefully destructive nuclear bombs so it’s pretty hard to get rid of the giants. \nEren has always wished to go see beyond the walls that cage him and had since then aspired to become a part of the Scouting Legion, who go\n          \n        outside the walled habitat while killing titans (aka. giants). Regrettably, the Scouting Legion also has an eyebrow-raising mortality rate and his mama wasn’t all too happy to realise her son wants to throw his life away in the Legion. However… His dad didn’t make too much of a big deal out of it, so…\nAudience: Hey! What happened?\nREAD IT TO FIND OUT!\n*Huffs*\nNow, I'll be honest with you. I'm not that of a great big fan of the fantasy genre, so, having said that, considering that this IS a work of fantasy: it must be awesome and it sure is.\nI mean, once you get used to huge-ass giants trying to eat people and that mankind has almost gone extinct (yeah, I know, you have to get used to a LOT).\nTHEN! You will start to enjoy this series, sure, I ain’t crazy about the fact that the giants look like anatomy figures however, the characters and the art make up for that.\nSo, let’s pick on the characters, starting with the main character, Eren. Eren has this thirst to see past the walls of ‘safety’ (aka. the containment area where people live for their own SAFETY [you might have guessed that I’m not a big fan of ‘safety’ walls]), the only means for him to do that is to join the Scouting Legion which is literally, the front lines. This just goes to show that he's either EXTREMELY curious about what’s behind the walls and is brave beyond rational thinking or he’s just plain crazy.\nFrom {reading} experience, I can tell you that he isn’t the latter.\nAudience: AWWWW! We wanted some crazy-people action!\nWell, you’re not getting it from here.\nNot only that, but Eren’s also shown interest in being part of the Scouting Legion because…\nDid you REALLY think I’ll tell you all the dirty details? Pfffffffft.\nBut basically, the characters are really interesting. Each has their own solid personality, that are pretty realistic to be honest if you remember the setting of the story. You see complex types of thinking; which means that the characters aren’t stereotypical (HUZZAH!).\nThe illustrations further add to the plot and characters.\nThe illustrations were a lovely, refreshing breath of non-sparkly side-effects. It wasn’t that very detailed but the expert use of shading is beyond me. I didn’t think shading could make such a difference until I read this Manga, it gave it that extra 'ummph' that breathed life into the characters. Startlingly, it was also proportionate and even though it wasn’t THAT detailed, it was detailed, there's no denying.\nOverall, I really enjoyed reading this novel, maybe for the simple truth of character growth. We started this story when the characters were kids until they grew up to be a set of fine lads and gals. It is a story technique that is unfortunately lost upon the mainstream goop with its lack of memorable characters and their flimsy personalities not excluding the overly done side effects; by the way, if you’re confused, I am talking about mainstream stories not the CrAzY good Manga that is being reviewed.\nAudience: Yeaaaaah… We knew that ALL along! Right, guys?              Guys..?\n*Cricket noises*\nBack to the point, I want to point out that the author is pretty daring to put their fictitious world on paper, they must be quite patient to use the child-to-adult plot technique and may have an ingenious quality because of the fact that when all is said and done, the Manga is STILL good. \nAside from its’ sly backstabbing on religion and its’ slight promotion of atheism, it is Manga you can't put down. I’d recommend it for its’ spunk and most importantly for its’ remarkable characters.\nP.S.\nSome of which kick MAJOR hard-core neck! \n(Audience: Whaaaat? \nYou read that right, figure it out by reading the Manga)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="            \n    Singeki no Kyojin (SNK) AKA Attack on Titan's main appeal is its unsettling imagery, gore, and its insane plot twists. The twists and turns in the plot are what strap viewers into bingeing the roller coaster that is this series.\nStory: 9, The story is, like I said, full of wild twists and turns. The anime starts by setting a really dreary tone about the harsh reality the characters face living in the fear and shadow of the titans, but, without spoiling too much, uses this pessimism to create one of the hypest plot twists I have ever experienced. Only one of these plot twists falls\n          \n        a bit on its face, but its at the beginning. There is a bit of an odd, convoluted overall mythology in the series that doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times, but its been getting clearer as the series goes on. \nArt: 7, One of the reasons why author Isayama-sensei had such trouble getting SNK getting published in the first place is that his art style, although certainly passable, is not too great. The line work has quite a sketchy feel, which sometimes can add to the unsettling atmosphere of the story, but most of the time it can feel, for lack of a better word, sloppy. However, Isayama-sensei renders the faces and forms of the titans extremely well, and his style gives them an extremely unsettling air; it is with his human chacters, with whom we spend the most time, that get shorted because of the somewhat sketchy art. \nCharacter: 10, SNK has an amazing cast of character. They're quite diverse and from all walks of life, varying in gender, sexuality, and background. SNK has a good amount strong female characters and there is almost no fan-service, which I personally enjoy. Isayama-sensei has said on twitter than he will not be confirming the sexuality of any characters, but there are a handful of LGBT characters nonetheless. \nEnjoyment: 10, SNK gets you hype. Its characters, pacing (though a little wonky at times), and plot twists all contribute to make reading SNK a great experience. However, just to note, one critisim of the manga is that it can feel like 'imperialist propaganda'-- and to be honest, I don't really know what that means, but if you want to avoid things overly political, I think it's important for me to share. I still give it a 10 for enjoyment though.  \nOverall: 9\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="              \n    I did not like the anime when it was first aired. I thought that the anime didn't deserve that much hype. I recently started reading the manga and I love it. I caught up with the manga in one week. The manga changed my opinion on the series. The story, twists and reveals are amazing. The characters of Attack on Titan are the best part of the manga. Even the secondary characters like Connie, Jean, Sasha are well written. The best characters are Levi, Erwin and Eren. The decisions that the characters have to make are really interesting. There is always a mystery and suspense\n          \n        element to each and every chapter. The story of the manga moves a little bit slowly but it is worth it. At first, I did not like the art but it grew on me. The art is incredibly detailed. The story is very depressing and intense. It is not for the faint-hearted. The fights are well drawn. Some of the fights which happen later in the manga are mind blowing. Each and every chapter is important to the story, there are no fillers. The only problem is that we have to wait an entire month for only 40-50 pages of story.\nI would recommend this manga to anyone who wants to try something new and different. After reading the manga, I went from not liking Attack on Titan to absolutely loving it. It is one of my favorites. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="           \n    Ahh, where do i begin? This mana was something I decided reading after finishing the anime, which i can say was a great experience. So without further ado, let's make it as simple as possible without giving too many spoilers.\nStory: 9\nYes, we all know the cliche story of humanity in peril and the giant monsters that are responsible for it. However, there are little manga's that are actually sticking to the fact that humanity still dod not defeat those monsters. True, the show did give us the \"Hero that has a power that came from those monsters to kill them\". But they are doing it\n          \n        good and most important of all they have the balls to actually kill main characters at ANY moment. i won't tell you when, but let's say that the show is one of the only i am current;y reading that still have the guts to kill the main hero/es at any moment without any warning or any way to \"fix it at the last moment due to 'plot device'\".\nCharacters: 9 \nIn my opinion the strongest part of the manga. The characters in the show are extremely complicated. For those of you who's read the \"Clash of the Titans\" arc, you probably know whose the main villain of the arc and while their motives are still unclear to us, we know that they didn't do that out of simple villainy. They do feel remorse. And they are not so easy to hate even after revealing their true nature. They did it because they had to. That revelation made it cleat to me that moral in the show is not something as simple as good and bad. The sense of morality in the show is even become more unbalanced in the following arc, I won't tell you what happens but ill tell you this, that arc gave us new information that made it clear that no character in the show that is purely good, or at least not in the eyes of all characters, and the plot forces them to do things that shake the reality they are used to like it was nothing. in my opinion every main character, and some of the side characters, are extremely important to feel the show moving and they are doing a great job of making you wonder which side truly is right and which is wrong.\nArt: 8\nWhile it isn't on berserk level, the art in this show is still something i enjoy very much, except when you look at the difference between the anime design and the manga design, but all in all the art is really nice, with some shots looking really amazing and some making you really feel like you can just see anything there, plus the titans are amazingly drawn, each in a different way, making you see that there are no two titans that look the same.\n\nEnjoyment: 8 \nThe only reason i don't place it on a higher rank is the simple fact tat every chapter comes only once per month, making it hard to keep the hype between every chapter and trying to remember what happened last time. however, that manga and the plot are too good for me to just let this make the better judgement for me. The show it great and the manga is even better, even if the anime added one part for the managa that wasn't there (see episode 25 of the anime and manga chapter 34 for the difference). But all in all i really enjoyed the show thus far and Im sure Im going to keep enjoying it.\nOverall rating: 9 \nThis manga is one of the best manga's out there at the time, it is bold, courageous and doesn't afraid to kill any character at any moment and give plenty of development and explanations that keep everything clear or making you question the morality of the manga at any moment. It is these features that made me like this manga so much and i know that those if you whose looking for good manga (even if released slowly), this is the manga for you.\nI hope you enjoyed or found this review helpful and please don't fear to send me your thoughts or responses and ill answer them as good as I can.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="          \n    Attack on Titan was the biggest, most popular anime of 2013 by far, and Shingeki no Kyojin was also huge, reaching second place in manga sales in Japan for 2013 and defeating One Piece's five year reign as most popular manga in sales in 2014. Naturally the question comes, how good could it be?\nSTORY- 8/10\nWhile the manga suffers from even more pacing issues than the anime did in the first half, the overall storyline is decent, even with some characters dying that you don't care about. While the story does deviate from Titans for a certain period, it does so for an understandable reason, even\n          \n        if it gets kind of boring in some of the dialogue scenes. \nDidn't like how Eren and the gang went from seeing their hometown get screwed over as kids in Chapter 2 to having to participate in the largest scale battle in the series so far two chapters later. The pacing does get better later on as Eren gets introduced to the Survey Corpsmen and they go off on their expeditions. \nART- 7/10\nSnK's art reminds me of rough pencil sketches, and are pretty crudely drawn. That might put some people down but can also help a reader see the dark aspects of the story with the bleak faces on the characters. Could've been better, like in Levi's side story No Regrets, but still readable and enjoyable. Scenes with the 3DMG in use were pretty cool though. \nCHARACTER- 8/10\nSo...the three main characters are okay, but not great, apart from maybe Armin. Eren the badass main who seeks to kill all the Titans, Mikasa the even more badass female lead who seeks only to protect Eren, and Armin the crybaby who is secretly a brilliant strategist and actually does stuff. The side characters are many and aren't very well known at first, but are eventually unraveled to have their own motives for joining the military. \nWhile there were problems with the characters in the anime, as many weren't fully developed by the time Season 1 ended, the manga sufficiently solves those problems by fully developing a good portion of the cast that was neglected during the first season and even gives some of the more generic characters (Mikasa and Levi for example) some more character depth. Still some deaths of minor characters we don't care about, but still better than what Season 1 of the anime could do. The introductions of the characters weren't that great and I had to do some reading before I could fully understand them.\nENJOYMENT- 8/10\nBeing a fan of the anime, it was only natural that I would come to like the manga too. Seeing how the characters develop and the twists in the plot. Action sequences were nice, we learn more about the world of the Titans and some of their motives behind the actions. \nOVERALL- 8/10\nWhile there are still some problems in the story, along with some plot gaps and confusing scenes, the manga is still a very good series to read and one of the better ones out there, even with its pacing issues and such. Would recommend to people who are fans of dark action/post-apocalyptic and the casual reader. Not recommended to those who enjoy extremely well-thought out storylines with anti-heroes that have struggles with their humanity and such, and have extremely high expectations in manga. \n        "},

They established nothing from before, and shit just starts popping up from nowhere, this is introduced, that is introduced, basically, the setting is minimalistic, the twist is that, ha, there is even more settings you knew nothing about! Okay. So instead of working what we got, we get mountains of expositions on what everything is. That's what make the story so terrible, other than the abrupt tonal shift. \nI want to say I am\n          \n        pissed that they literally made up a bunch of shit that has no establish connection to what was already presented, but honestly it's kind of hilarious how it went from [POTIENTIAL SPOILERS] minimalistic steampunk survival horror to full-on modern world borderline Gundam storyline about spies and war with a segregated race that can pilot the Gundam with a lot of other shit introduced to fix up plotholes regarding why they aren't fighting back despite being oppressed and presented with powers. [POTIENTIAL SPOILERS END]  \nThe characters are also so dull when one character was said to have died, I went \"meh\" meanly because they were given no real personality and was inadequately developed. I really don't care about them after they changed the theme from \"struggle for freedom for humanity\" to a goddamn war story with even more shit being made up along the way.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="          \n    All complaints aside, I don't think many mangas can match Shingeki no Kyojin's titanic entertainment value :D\nInitially, I thought some of the major plot twists were downright silly. I'm trying not to spoil, so I'll just say that I remember thinking stuff like 'Wut? No one bothered to check what the wall was made of? For a 100 years?' or counting on my fingertips thinking 'Ok, so thats nearly half of his friends who're...wow'. I thought about it however, and now I think that without those twists, the story would have been pretty boring and linear. I really love how everything is linked in this\n          \n        manga; nothing is without purpose. I suppose some would say it narrows the world down (as thats what I used to think), but I think it works great for manga.\nThe artwork really sells this manga in my opinion. The heavy emphasis of the blacks and shadows really suits the survival theme, and the titans are truly the scariest manga antagonists ever! What's really terrifying about the way the titans are drawn is that, their faces are so realistic, I can actually say I've seen people that look like them! \nThe characters are a bit mediocre, and there are so many characters without any unique qualities that are overshadowed by the main character's outstanding abilities. However, the manga isn't devoid of character development, and when it happens, it's in relevance to the story (linking to what I've said above) so there's the pro of not having to read unnecessary backstory.\nIt ain't perfect, but I think this manga trades the mere possibility of becoming a masterpiece in exchange for pure enjoyment. I think that's great :D\n        "},

The unique in it quickly gain fans attention, and it's not usual that I was interested to find out more about it. \nWhen first I read the manga, I can enjoy the art, although it's a mess, but I can gasp the expressions of each characters.

Though I got sick already with well drawn manga but have sucks story.\nI quickly become a fan and as I read furthermore, reading the mangaka's interviews, I learned how he treat the characters equally. It's a very plus point for this manga because it seems like the mangaka have great understanding of people's personalities. Another thing that is great about this, is the fight scenes. It looks great because the mangaka understand martial art.\nNo story is perfect, and because I really like the story, I wrote rant on tumblr about how stupid Erwin Smith leads his men to sacrifice the troops and all, how uneffective 3DMG is (because it's melee weapon, used to fight overly powerful enemy, which is a big mistake in war strategy), I still have reasons to not drop the manga. Funny thing is, all of my rants and questions on the tumblr articles are answered one by one as I made progress on reading the story. \nShingeki no Kyojin is a masterpiece, although it's art is not beautiful, but everything describe very well in it. \nRate : \"Manga you should read before you die\"\n        "},

I'll be honest, Attack on Titan was one of the first anime I watched, and I really liked it. But the anime is NOTHING compared to this. I expected a simple, mindless action manga, judging by what the anime offered, and the 18 volumes that are out at the moment far exceeded my expectations.\nWith such a large amount of characters, making readers care about each and every one of them is a difficult thing to pull off, but Isayama does it just fine. I especially liked the\n          \n        arc that focused on Ymir and Christa, I just thought their relationship was so nice and it gave depth to two characters that could have been completely useless. As for Eren, Mikasa, and Armin, they aren't exactly the best main characters, but they're all good in their own way, they all have their flaws and good traits alike. Oh, also, this is a bit off topic but I love that they're none of that \"power of friendship\" crap that's in most shounen.\n**Incoming spoilers**\nNow let's talk about the story. I thought that this manga wasn't going to have much story at all, aside from killing titans and making military plans. That all changed with the arc where the Survey Corps decided to overthrow the king and they started to discover more and more about the Titans. While some were upset that we didn't get to see Titans for a while, I think that part did a lot of good for the story.\nIf I have any complaints about Attack on Titan, it would be the pacing. Some parts are a bit too slow, some too rushed. I also didn't like the way Isayama revealed the Armored and Colossal titans' identities, it didn't feel right.\nOverall, Shingeki no Kyojin is an awesome manga that I would totally recommend for lovers of action series, this was a much longer review than I had hoped, and I can't wait for volume 19.\n        "},
