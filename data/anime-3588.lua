                          \
    Soul Eater is an impressive anime. It's one of those where you will no doubt enjoy watching\
::STORY::\
After watching some of the first episode you'll think Soul Eater will have your typical Shonen story. Basically, human weapons and their student technicians reside in Shibusen and have to collect 99 evil human souls and 1 witch soul, the reward being that the technician's weapon will transform into a Death Scythe. \
It seems pretty formulaic, nothing you haven't seen before. The way the first few episodes pan out will make this seem like the main goal, but soon after you'll realise there is actually a deeper story developing.\
          \
        This story isn't something complex or too clever, but events that happen during the story makes Soul Eater watchable and interesting, the action is ever present, it always keeps humour in mind, but can be serious and emotional when it needs to be. Eventually you will forget what the main characters were initially trying to acheive because the story drags it in such a different direction. The problem is that the story isn't anything memorable. At points you might watch and forget the reason why they are doing something. That is the anime's weak point\
\
::CHARACTERS::\
This is what Soul Eater will be remembered for. Its colourful cast of characters.\
Maka, our main character and a technician, despite being flawed she is always looking to do the right thing, always thinking of others, easily annoyed and determined. She grew on me as I realised she is probably the most human of all the characters. Soul, Maka's weapon. Just your typical cool guy? No. He is much deeper than he looks. Despite what he says he is only concerned about one thing: To protect Maka.\
Black*Star is Energetic, rash, loud, bashful and his one goal in life is to become bigger than God. He can provide you with comic relief and become involved in intense battles yet shows his human side often, his weapon Tsubaki is always willing to help him whenever she can.\
Death the Kid seems like some 'Mr Perfect' character. And he can be, but also has his flaws, most notable his obssessive compulsive disorder about symmetry. Anything slightly out of alignment will either cause him to fix the problem immediately or spiral into goth style depression. His weapons Patty and Liz are usually around to comfort him when he goes crazy or gets depressed.\
The supporting cast are memorable as well. The grim reaper is always cheerful and relaxed; Spirit (Maka's father) is desperate for Maka's attention, even though she doesn't enjoy his company much; Blair is your typical fanservice character; Professor Stein is strong and clever yet deeply maniacal; Crona is shy and fearful, but powerful; Medusa, the main antagonist is pure genious; Mifune is an action and Samurai fan's dream character and plenty more who you'll come across.\
Most characters will stand out at least once giving you reasons to like or dislike them. Characters are a strong point in this anime.\
::ANIMATION & ART::\
The good thing about this anime is that nobody looks ordinary or familiar, you'll notice every character has a certain design, from Soul's sharp teeth and Maka's plain green eyes to Kid's strange hairstyle and Liz & Patty's odd hats, all characters are uniquely styled.\
All scenes are quite detailed, the atmosphere is usually dark but manages to look bright at the same time (a rare sight in anime). If its what the background artists were going for, I think they nailed it. Shortcuts are rare which is good, you can see that episodes weren't rushed. The art stays consistent (unlike Naruto) and the quality remains the same throughout.\
The action is fluid, creative and non-standard (unlike Bleach) fight scenes aren't just repetitive movements shown at different angles, or just sword bashing and gun blasting. It manages to keep fight scenes interesting. Another strong point is action, which never fails.\
::SOUND::\
At first you will be introduced to 'Resonance'. A memorable opening track that fits very well to the series. This would be among the best if it wasn't for 'PAPERMOON' the 2nd opening which is even better than Resonance. I'm yet to come across anyone who thinks otherwise. This opening is epic. All ending themes are decent. Some are generic, the best being the current ending 'STRENGTH' and the 2nd ending 'Style' which stands out more than the 1st ending 'I wanna be' and 'Bakusō Yume Uta' which you will not remember at all.\
Audio is decent, but there aren't any special moments or tracks that will hype you up or give you that tingly feeling inside when coupled with a good action scene. Songs aren't memorable like something Bruce Faulconer could cook up but do fit well with most happenings.\
::CONCLUSION::\
Soul Eater is an anime that manages to keep consistency throughout. It's lack of fillers (with the exception of the excalibur episodes which will drive you nuts) is enough for action fans to watch without worry, seriously 98% of the episodes are significant to the story (unlike Bleach which has whole filler arcs. 20+ FILLERS IN ONE GO!!!). \
I find this more enjoyable to watch than Naruto or One Piece (which are heavily overrated). Mainly because the anime has a point and sticks to it. The Medusa Arc is to stop Medusa reviving the Demon God. The Arachnophobia Arc is to stop Arachne to allow the Demon God to spread madness over the world. \
People complain about lack of originality but I am yet to find an anime that is truly similar. Shinigami's have been used before, but Shinigami literally translates to The Death God or The Grim Reaper, who in this case rules Shibusen and his son. Due to the halloween theme of Soul Eater I find the Grim Reaper necessary and is in no way similar to Ryuk of Death Note or characters like Rukia of Bleach. Let's get this straight their only link they have is the word 'Shinigami'\
And finally Soul Eater is a must watch for any Shonen (Action, Comedy) fan. It has already been licensed by FUNimation which means a dub is coming soon and I believe Soul Eater will become another one of those famous anime shows. The only difference is it is actually has consistent entertainment value. show less \

    Soul Eater is about a group of students who attend a school for aspiring demon hunters, Shibusen. The story follows Maka, an scythe weilder and her partner, Soul, who transforms into the scythe she uses. Each hunter is paired with a partner who can turn into a weapon, and the two must fight in unison. The other main characters include Death the Kid, and his weapons Liz and Patty who become twin pistols, and Black Star, along with his partner Tsubaki, who has the unique ability to transform into several weapon types as a jack of all trades. These students as well as their teachers\
          \
        now fight the various demons and witches who want to destroy Shibusen in order to take over the world without consequence.\
This show is incredibly stylish, literally everything has a very cool vibe about it and really stands out from other similar animes. If FLCL and Bleach came together and had a love child, that child would be Soul Eater. The characters are all likeable and unique, even if they do follow the list of shonen anime stereotypes (loud kid who wants to be the best, check; quiet cool guy, check; self-depricating girl who holds much potential power, double check.) The adult characters are less stereotypical than the kids, which can make them more interesting to watch in certain episodes, however. Even if their personalities are familiar, there is enough unique and enjoyable about them that it never becomes a problem.\
The fights themselves are very well animated and choreographed. They're all ridiculous and cartoony, but they are always visceral and exciting to watch. The progression is also very shonen in nature, with enemies that are way stronger than the heroes, and the heroes having to train to beat them and gain new powers, but again its so entertaining it shouldn't become a big issue. The fights are all about style and execution though, and if you keep that in mind and don't analyze them with rational thought, they all become very entertaining and exciting. The first 26 episodes are great flashy entertainment for anime fans.\
I really wish I could stop the review at this point, and tell you Soul Eater is a really fun shonen series that fans of action anime should see. Now the bad point of the show, the entire second half of the series. Around the halfway point, Soul Eater changes from a lighthearted, entertaining fun action anime into a serious, melodramatic action anime. The story starts to take itself way too seriously, and the enjoyment of this anime greatly suffers because of this. When your anime is about people who transform into guns and swords who fight witches, it's kind of hard to take the change in tone seriously.\
Soul Eater ends up losing most if not all of its charm because of this drastic and unnecessary shift in tone. All of the characters become whiny punks who sulk all day, and Maka becomes borderline unbearable as a main character with her melancholic attitude and constant bitching about how she's not strong enough to fight the main enemy of the show. All of this nonsense comes together in a final episode that is so ridiculous I would sound stupid if I tried to explain it in this review. Let me just put it to you this way, all themes the show was building up to this point are thrown out the window, the main villain turns into a gigantic pansy, and the logic behind the ending makes absolutely no sense in the grand scheme of the show. Oh, and it tries to copy Evangelion in ways that are so unnecessary and artistically nonsensical in the show that I laughed out loud when I first saw them in this episode.\
What in the world happened to Soul Eater? What happened to this really fun, always entertaining action anime in the second half of the show? What is with all this ridiculous emo nonsense that gets introduced in the second half? How the hell could Bones, the studio behind Fullmetal Alchemist and Eureka Seven fail so badly at this show? I have no idea how to answer any of these questions. If you are going to watch Soul Eater, watch the first 26 episodes, and then stop. Otherwise, you are in store for one of the strangest, confusing, and most disappointing action animes ever made. Come on Bones, you are better than this.\

    Here we have Soul Eater, a shounen anime produced by Bones (Wolf's Rain, Full Metal Alchemist, Ouran High School Host Club) that came out in 2008. I've never read the manga, so this is based solely on the anime. Set in the fantastical Death City, Soul Eater focuses on the Shibusen Academy, where students both work together and compete in order to turn their partners - boys and girls that can turn into various different weapons - into world-class Death Scythes. My university pally and I blasted through all 51 episodes in about a week, if you don't count the days that we were too\
          \
        busy to watch any. Let me tell you, this does not make for hard watching. \
The first few episodes start off as prequels for the main seven characters - three 'Meisters/Technicians' and their 'Weapons'. These episodes are ones that I found to be somewhat disjointed, and to be honest I probably would have given up on the anime after 4 episodes or so if it wasn't for aforementioned pally. Swiftly afterwards, once the main characters start to interact together, I was hooked. And shortly after that when the frankly ingenious support characters were introduced and fleshed out, I was manic about it to the point where I was screaming in outrage at the screen if any other character DARED to so much as harm a hair on their heads.\
Plot - [7/10] I wouldn't describe the plot as being either typical or particularly inventive. I will say, however, that it does dangle a standard premise in front of you for a good few episodes (in order for a Technician to turn their Weapon into the ultimate Death Scythe, they must collect 99 evil souls and then one Witch's soul; cue epic quest) and then almost entirely removes it for something much better - a pleasant surprise that, as I understand it, doesn't quite happen in the manga. While some elements of the plot remain unclear and somewhat incomplete by the end of the series, I ultimately felt that it didn't detract too much from my enjoyment. Bar the very last scenes, unfortunately, in which I was left starving for a bit more of a tie-up, or better yet, a follow-up montage in the ending credits. Still, I suppose that's what the manga's for.\
Characters - [9/10] The meat of Soul Eater, with some big-name voice actors who really give the characters life. Firstly, we have Miyano Mamoru-san (Yagami Light of Death Note, Kiba of Wolf's Rain) as the symmetry-obssessed Death the Kid (an awkward-sounding name, I have to say, that belies a truly slick character); the ever-prolific and utterly fabulous Koyasu Takehito-san (Sakarazuka Seishirou of Tokyo Babylon, Zechs Merquise/Milliardo Peacecraft of Gundam Wing) as the Weapon Excalibur, who will surprise you in several different ways with his presence throughout the series; and Kobayashi Yumiko-san (Sarah McDougal of Love Hina, Dan Taichi of Prince of Tennis) as the headstrong Black*Star, to whom a nod must go for the most subtle yet engaging main-character development; to name a few. On top of these, Soul Eater showcases a surprising amount of young, new talent - notably, the voices of Soul (the title character) and Maka Albarn, the female lead who I unfortunately found to be incredibly irritating. \
Let me make my point hard on this. Maka is hard-working and academically very smart, with a down-to-earth attitude that helps her to deal with her absent mother and womanizing father, who recently divorced prior to the start of the series. But (and oh, it's a big But) it doesn't last. Rather than character growth, we seem to have a case of the exact opposite as the series progresses. Maka repeatedly ends up making absolutely ridiculous decisions that can in no way be logically justified. As much as I don't like to use Naruto as a comparison, I think I have to. Maka's choices aren't a Naruto-style situation wherein Naruto makes sometimes-stupid decisions because of his raw emotions, because that's Naruto's character and way of life; plus, Naruto has (for the most part) the strength to back up his convictions. Maka, on the other hand, does not. Not only that, but she apparently doesn't learn from her monumental mistakes. And /then/ she'll bitch to the series' headstrong character Black*Star about how he acts before he thinks. Though, come to think of it, at least Maka isn't exactly a hypocrite on that matter because it's shown that she does in fact think about her actions before she carries them out, comes to the conclusion that it's stupid... and then does the wrong thing /anyway/. If it wasn't for almost every other character providing sustained interest and sheer compelling brilliance whenever Maka's off-screen, I think Soul Eater would fall far short of greatness. \
Art - [9/10] And of course, there can be no characters without the visual art. While the quality of the animation itself is fairly standard shounen-style fare, the rating for this section gets bumped up enormously for originality. The designs of virtually everything - from the fantastically surreal moon and sun to the laboratory of the anime's resident Mad Scientist (who would have an entire paragraph in the above section if it wouldn‘t turn into an essay on why he’s such a /darn good character/ on both an emotional and a story-telling level) to the eyes of the later villains - positively shines with mouth-watering creativity. I could wax lyrical about the brain-melting inventiveness of the character designs all day. It's honestly worth watching for the artistic genius alone.\
Music - [8/10] With the exception of the very first ending theme (which was painful, if I'm honest), I thoroughly appreciated each different ending and opening. They were well-chosen and fitted the style and feel of the anime well. The music used throughout the episodes themselves suited the atmosphere wonderfully - the fighting music was driving, the sad-scenes music was sorrowful and the cheery music gave the anime a smile. While it wasn't as memorable as, say, the music to Gundam Wing or Gintama, it did its job in style. Also in this section, I'd like to add that the song sung by the Weapon Excalibur made me almost die of Sheer Heart-Rending Joy.\
Overall - [9/10] Easy to watch and a great mix of creepy, surreal and fun. Objectively, I'd give this a high 8, and then I'm going to take the liberty of bumping it up to a 9 for the downright enjoyment I experienced with this show. I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Full Metal Alchemist or Gintama - or, for that matter, any shounen manga/anime - as well as anyone who enjoyed the quirks of such series as Ouran High School Host Club.\

    Okay, I'm not a fan of reviewing shows in their early stages, but when I read the other reviews here; I just had to write up one, because I don't find it as great as most of the reviewers here on MAL. I find Soul Eater to be a bit of a rip-off from Bleach. It's still decent, though.\
Okay, so some people have criticized my opinion that Soul Eater is a rip-off of Bleach (though making an entire review for that is a bit over the top). I'm fully aware that Bleach is very similar to a few older animes too, but the fact still\

        stands that Soul Eater is too similar to Bleach. And evt. older animes about shinigami or similar stuff. It's got it's original contents, but overall it's just too similar for comfort.\
The story up to ep. 18 has mostly been an episode-by-episode story, but a plot  slowly beginning to sneak in behind the scenes from here on. I'm not sure what direction it will take from here, and this is why I don't like reviewing so early. However, I believe that it will get better as we go on, so for now I'll keep the story at a 7, for unoriginality and because only the latest episodes have shown a continuous plot.\
The animation is more cartoony than many anime out there, I feel. That's not necessarily a bad thing; I mean, coloring and shading and effects are very good, but some things bugs me a lot - f.ex. the Shinigami, the moon and the sun aren't very pleasing to look at. The animation deserves an 8: It's good quality and lovable character designs, but there's just something about the overall feel of it that bugs me.\
The soundtrack isn't very remarkable either. The background music isn't anything noteworthy, but it's not bad either - it fits with the mood. The OP and ED themes are decent, but I think I'd only listen to the first ED theme outside of watching the show. The voice acting is good too. All in all, I'd rate it a 7.\
The characters are fair too. I mean, they're funny to watch, but funny isn&rsquo;t enough to rate it high up. They lose some points for spurs of unoriginality, but there's still some original characters there. I'm especially fond of Death the Kid and his obsession with symmetry, because I can somewhat identify with him (though not on such an obsessed level). There hasn't been a lot of character development so far either - only Maka's desire to get stronger -, and the series is already 1/3 done. However, much can happen, and again, since I'm reviewing at such an early stage, I won't prejudge them. But for now, I'm keeping it at a 7, losing points for unoriginality and low character development so far but gaining points because they're funny as well as the presence of a few original and likable characters.\
I'm enjoying Soul Eater, but only enough to watch it. It loses too much because it hasn't got a large amount of originality. It's good entertainment, but not necessarily good.\

    Short and Sweet Review:\
Soul Eater is one of the most unique anime&rsquo;s I have ever seen in the sense of graphics and story. The graphics are ultra-high quality, along with very interesting anime cut-scenes. Soul Eater has a little taste of everything an anime should have &ndash; a first-class story, superior graphics, a modest bit of pervert, and a VERY interactive world. Camera angle and character motions are very musical, flow very well with each other, and so on - which is one of the biggest plus sides to this anime. The characters are very fun and surprising - which is a big part of\
          \
        the story.\
10/10 ~ Epic.\
This review will be updated as the series progresses.\
If you did in fact find this review helpful, I do take value in my &ldquo;Helpful&rdquo; rating, so please take a moment of your time to tell me how you liked this review.\

    Dazzling animation, zany characters, seductive story-lines, awesome music scores - these acclamations yet still fail to justify Soul Eater enough as my favourite anime of the current season.\
Produced by Bones, who brought us Ouran High School Host Club and Darker than BLACK, Soul Eater is adapted from the manga by Ookubo Atsushi. It is of personal importance to mention the manga for the animer is a very close adaptation of the latter. In a nutshell, the story follows three student weapon technicians and their respective partners, as they embark on a journey to combat evil, and yet grow up  with each other at the\
          \
        same time. Each of the main protagonists are attractive in their own right - ranging from the slick yet ridiculously symmetry-compulsive Death the Kid, to the broodingly cool scythe, Soul, Soul Eater provides characters which are strong enough to carry the series on their own backs. \
The story follows a general plot-line really, with the student weapon technicians going to school, equipping themselves with combat skills, so as to fight the forces of evil in the context of the show. Throughout however, we are treated to comedy and mere innocence from the characters - for they are really just kids trying to grow up - so Soul Eater as a show generally turns out to be quite the light-hearted pick. Nevertheless, there are episodes which tug at the strings of the heart, where the emotions of the characters really reach out to you, and also episodes which are pure comedy, where you inevitably laugh at the zaniness of the world. Why can't school and friends be like these, you wonder?\
The music is awesome - produced by Iwasaki Taku, of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann fame. Responsible for tracks in the latter, like Libera me from Hell and FIGHT THE POWER (remember?), he delivers as well in Soul Eater. The music fits the mood perfectly, fighting and comedy scenes are complimented by their music, and I really believe he does a good job here. \
Art is Soul Eater's strongest selling point. Bones did really well animating the fight scenes in the manga, and the colours are so rich and beautiful, that every episode is a joy to behold. The drawing of the characters are good - but these are pretty normal, I must say. It is the sketches of the environment, and the animation that really stands out. Soul Eater was the anime which spoiled me in terms of fight scenes. Used to think that Bleach offered really good ones - but after watching this, the former seemed really average at best. \
Characters are attractive, and you will find yourself liking some of them more than the others. Antagonists are seductively evil, and you cannot help but like them. Powerful, and pretty witches make up the cast of the latter - and it is quite fun to watch the inner dynamics where they manipulate each other for their own benefits. Voice talent is not too great, but it is acceptable. Most notable is Miyano Mamoru, who did Yagami Light in Death Note, but that is pretty it, really. The seiyuu for Soul and Maka are making their debuts, and they have quite a mixed reception. Not its greatest selling point, that's for sure.\
Nevertheless, Soul Eater is a great show for all its strengths in animation and music. Its light-hearted tone throughout is also ideal for those who seek to enjoy the anime after a tough day at work or school. There is no need to think too much about plot implications (apologies if you are a sucker for these), Soul Eater allows you to just sit back and gawk at the wonders of modern-day art. Definitely a show worth your time. \

    Soul eater, soul eater, soul eater. What can I possibly say about thee?! The description at the top tells you the base of the story but it doesn't nearly touch on how great and truly entertaining it really is! As I continue to watch this anime is never ceases to make me laugh and I just want more and more and more.\
Story:\
This story takes place in a area called death city where a shinagami helps humans destroy eggs of kishin by turning them in meisters and giving them weapons to obtain these eggs of kishin and one soul of a witch and turn  there\
          \
        scythe into a death scythe. Though this is what all students at the school Shibusen school aim for they are also being taught how to fight and protect the world against the development of a demon god and a demon sword. Though the plot seems pretty basic kill the bad guys, it is far from it and has its own unique characters and twist itself. It somehow manages to tie in school life and relationships between people without being overly cheesy and turning everything into a romantic story. \
Art:\
THE ART IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! When I first began to watch this I just kept saying in my head the art is great the art is great the art is great and thats what it is its great. The art is very different from the typical anime it sleek and it gives something new and fresh to bring to the animation table. By just looking at the first 5 minutes of the show you can see that. Props to the artist. You will definitely not be disappointed in the art.\
Sound:\
Ah and so TMR strikes again with his poppy tunes. The opening is awesome I suppose it matches the anime very well and not mention very catchy! Th ending theme is well, I've heard better lol. But I guess it also fits it well. So music gets an A.\
Characters:\
I must say these characters are all hilarious! They all have their own special charm about them. My favorite being death the kid. His obsession with everything being symmetrical provides many laughs for the viewer. Black Star is the overly hyper kid who wants to be the best (sounds familiar) but unlike others he actually doesn't win all the time, very funny character as well. Maka the lovable heroine. Soul the unpredictable side kick always giving maka words of advice. All the characters as I said are very fun to watch and you get to know them well. \
Enjoyment:\
I thoroughly enjoy this anime. It has its action but is full of laughs. Everything in it just works out really well with each other and theres always something new to learn about everyone and everything in every episode. Very interesting, very addictive, and I expect you who reads this to watch the show!\
Trust me you will laugh more than once! Its worth the watch. So now go on whatever site you go and search for it now! \

    :STORY: 5\
Ultimately my main complaint about this series lies in this area. And I am going to be a little hard on it because of how much potential I saw that it could have had. I guess I should start by saying that what the story lacks is organization and commitment. Throughout the entire series, different conflicts would be shoved on the backburner right in the middle of their climax, the conflcts would be built way up and then fall flat within a single episode or two, and sometimes conflicts would be forgotten about all together without any resolve being made at all. It became\
          \
        frustrating after being promised some huge development so many times only for it to either turn out to have no relevence to the story at all or just never followed through with. This applies to characters as well. There were several times where there were characters who took up whole episodes to be introduced and set up to do big things only to poke an uneccesary line every 20 episodes or so. I mean, I'm still mad about how this show handled Free and Eruka. Even the tone was a little flakey. It started out almost primarily a comedy but around halfway through almost stopped with the jokes entirely.\
But with all that said, I want to point out the good things they did, because there were things done well. I've found that many shounen series are a little shallow, and use things like \"cool action\" as a crutch. While this series did utilize action, it definetly wasn't a crutch, simply because it didn't need one. The action and the traditional main story of a larger than life villian out to destroy was used effectivley as a medium and as dynamic for what the show was really about, which was the inner growth of the struggling main characters. There will be pieces of the story where you find yourself in an expressionist environment that represents one of the character's soul, where the character grapples with personal conflicts in impressionistic ways. I found these portions of the story to be very profound and moving. Through this process you develop strong relationships and understanding of the main characters and really makes you care about what they are doing and what happens to them.\
:ART: 9\
The art and animation was truly great. It perfectly fitted the tone of the series as a whole and was furthermore customized to perfectly fit each character. Technically speaking, it was innovative and very fluid. I especially enjoyed the creativity shown in the design of pretty much everything. The characters, the buildings, the backgrounds, even the sky (you'll see what I mean if you haven't seen it yet) was drawn very cleverly and creatively. I could honestly say that someone could enjoy this series for its appearance alone.\
:CHARACTER: 7\
As said before, the characters are one the series' strengths. I'm sure the fact that a lot of the story comes from character development helps. Each character has tons of defining personality and everything about them, from their appearance to their diction works together and makes perfect sense. What really set the characters of this series apart from others is the intimate introspection we are subjected to as a viewer. What I think this did for the viewer is that it gave a deep understanding of the characters and because we understood where they stood emotionally and what drives them, it made it very difficult to dislike them. The bad guys hardly got the same treatment, which was fine because that wasn't what this show was about. All we really needed to know about them is that they sought to hurt and destroy the heroes (although I would have liked for Asura to retain his crazy mindless monster role instead of turning into the cliche arrogant bad guy).\
:ENJOYMENT: 7\
I hate putting a numbered rating for this because of how subjective it is. It really comes down to what you appreciate in an anime, and even still, it depends on what you are feeling like at the time. So I just put what level of enjoyment I found myself getting from Soul Eater. This series definetly fits a niche and provides easy-to-watch stimulation. Despite a good handful of deep moments, I don't know if a classy no-nonsense viewer would like wading through all the episodes to find them.\
:OVERALL: 6\
This anime could have been truly great, but all the extra, unimportant nonsense they threw in kept it from excelling. But still, if this fits your style, it'll definetly be one among the good ones.\

    This is my first anime review!!! X )\
Story: While Soul Eater does have an pretty good story line, it seems somewhat stereotypical. There is an organization that was created to protect the world from bad guys, and some evil organization is plotting against them and trying to destroy them. (Other examples are Bleach, Naruto, Tokyo Mew Mew, etc). Then suddenly out of nowhere, collecting almightly weapons all over the world comes into play, and now it seems that the characters are tied somewhere between Tsubasa Chroncle and Bleach, and are doing too much at once.\
Art: The art is probably one of the most unusual characteristics\
          \
        of Soul Eater, a sort of alternative anime look like many that have popped up over the years. The use of 3-D animation is astounding, there is pretty good detail, and colors and shading well support the story itself and the essence of the anime. The art work is not like any other anime that I have seen yet at least, most notibly the bloody sun and moon. The animation is also quite appropriate to the story line, and overall runs smoothly.\
Sound: The music was what got me addicted to the show. The opening theme astounded me as I watched all the characters go through the motions. As the theme song ended, I looked forward to the show itself, a sure fire way of knowing that the music is good. But then, the ending theme comes along. While not bad, it just couldn't compare to the opening, and left me slightly dissapointed. The animation and the sound were seemed together almost flawlessly, and that highly raised my liking of the show.\
Character: While not all the characters stood out to be memorable and interesting characters, there were a few characters that caught my eye: Death the Kid and Dr. Stein. Death the Kid adds a lot of the comedy with his addiction to making everything perfectly symmetrical, almost a pushover when fighting a symmetrical being, but a complete powerhouse when not doing so. The other Dr. Stein, with the awesome bolt in his head, has a fetish for dissection and experimenting, no matter how cruel. Also somewhat creepy and a sadist, but making him just a more likable character. While these two stood out the most, the other characters unfortunately seemed to blend too much in the background or were too stereotypical of commonly seen character types. All the characters were obviously well thought out however, and I praise that. Each character gets a fair amount of screen time, and have a decent past, and that just adds so much to the anime itself.\
Enjoyment: As you can see, I fairly enjoy this anime for many reasons, and I hope you enjoy it too, which I'm sure you will! The show is only about half over, so there still is a lot more Soul Eater to come!  : )\
Overall: Overall, it's a great anime, and that's why I'll will give it an 8.\

    So to put it simply, I don't normally do this. To put it specifically; Soul Eater is balls out entertaining as balls with balls on top. It's an action fantasy type school anime that tries to be Naruto and the Nightmare Before Christmas, then tries cocaine, develops a split personality and decides that it's both. And I'm not trying to fanboy all up in here but seriously Soul Eater was the perfect show to start out with as it got me into the medium of anime in the first place. The characters, action, and costumes try to be as over the top and flashy as\
          \
        possible just for the hell of it and that's really what dragged me into it. The show has three main teams of characters; two pairs and one threesome, a bunch of villains, and a ton of supporting characters, that each have their own abilities and personalities. What's weird is that Soul Eater takes a colorful cast of characters, throws them into the wacky world of Death City, as if to say \"Look. We know this is crazy so roll with it!\"....and it actually works. The first three episodes introduce the main teams and setting, and then treats the building blocks of the show like clay and does whatever it wants, adding new characters, villains, settings, trials, tribulations, plot elements and powers, and the plot still manages to chug along at a strangely consistent pace. The dialogue throughout is pretty heartfelt and also well written, in addition to the fact that there's a lot of fun humor in the show (or rather any time Excalibur is onscreen). I have very few problems with the show, but they did add some characters that I could care less about, namely some of the students like the guy with the swirly glasses and Mosquito, and I just could care less about them because they were just kinda there and they didn't affect the plot hardly at all. Plus if you're looking for a deep anime don't watch Soul Eater, it's able to play with the emotions but it's fairly shallow and not thought provokingl whatsoever.  But other than that and the super corny ending of the show, Soul Eater is a consistent and extremely entertaining romp that will keep your attention throughout. \

    I respect the opinions of all the people who find this show interesting. After all, people are allowed to have different opinions. However, I find it hard to understand when someone claims to hate Naruto yet at the same time loves Soul Eater. Sure, Soul Eater is not as a huge rip-off of Naruto as Nabari is, but it still incorporates many elements that make Naruto unwatchable in the first place. My point is, don't let Naruto-bashing become a trend. It's not like you have to hate Naruto just because a lot of people on the forums dislike it.\
As mentioned previously, I find this show\
          \
        unwatchable. Not only does it have nothing interesting to keep me watching, this show has as many annoying elements as Naruto ever had. The voice acting is one of the worst, especially Maka's voice. The director probably thinks that a bland voice might sound cute to the audiences, and I agree with that. However, there is a difference between being bland and being emotionless. A good bland voice acting that's still cute is found in Akazukin Chacha, a classic comedy anime. Maka's voice, on the other hand, feels as if the seiyu has not received any formal traning and just reads the words off the script.\
The plot lacks depth and the worldsetting is not as original as the fans claim. A world of Shinigami has been done thousands of times already so why starts a new one? The biggest problem is the characterization however. The number of annoying characters even exceeds that in Naruto, not to mention all of them have no depth whatsoever. Black Star has this huge ego that stems from nowhere, Kid has mental problems for sure, Maka's dad makes me feel sick with his overexaggerated emotions, and Shinigami is...well, he is just weird. I can go on for pages but you get my point. After 13 episodes, I just can't stand these annoying brats anymore, that's when I decided to drop it.\

    I completely redid this review since we are now at the half-way mark of the series. But my mind hasn't changed much: This series went from amusing to downright exciting.\
Story: 7 (Good)\
Let's face it, Soul Eater doesn't have a really strong plot. We're half-way through the series, and I fail to see (thus far, anyway) why characters such as Excalibur were even introduced, since at first he seemed that he might be a major character eventually, but we hardly ever see him do anything. This might well change of course, who knows, and this goes for more than one character, such as Blair for example.\
Anyway,\
          \
        whatever plot Soul Eater does have (yes, it does have one) is apparently split up into two 'arcs'. The first Medusa Arc, and the new Arachnophobia Arc seem to be the two major parts of the series. Neither so far seemed/seems to be too clear in what the final goal really is, but we know there is a main enemy waiting to be defeated, and of course, Soul and Maka's quest to turn Soul into a Death Scythe.\
All in all, the story is the weakest part of this show, but it doesn't render it unlikable or unwatchable. Not at all.\
Art: 10 (Outstanding)\
It's top notch, there is nothing more to say. The quality has remained consistent through-out, and hasn't been cheapened in any way. Worth the watch in HD!\
Sound: 10 (Outstanding)\
You thought Resonance was awesome? I like Paper Moon even better, myself. Sound effects, music, this show has it all, just the way you'd want it. No complaints.\
Character: 9 (Great)\
New characters are now being introduced, and all the old ones are still there. Character development in this show is done in such a way that you learn as you go, but still get a general idea what each character is about and how they tackle their situations. Black Star is brash and rushes in without thinking (and has a huge ego), Soul is cautious and calculating, yet can also be somewhat direct, you get the picture. If you're watching the show (which you should be), then I don't have to explain much more. If you're not watching it and are reading this to see if you would like to, trust me, you'll get to know the characters within the first three episodes. It's all you need.\
Character development could be better, but is pretty great as it is.\
Enjoyment: 10 (Outstanding)\
So far, I haven't watched a single episode I haven't found enjoyable. I'm not kidding, every single episode has something in it that will make you laugh or go 'YAR! KICK THAT ASS!' You'll find yourself cracking a smile here and there even if you are the harshest anime critic around, and you can't but help rooting for the good guys. Enjoyment is a hard thing to explain, but you always know that you're enjoying something when you... Well, when you are.\
Overall: 10 (Outstanding)\
Despite some of the obvious flaws in this series, it's really one of the best shows running right now. I won't say THE best, far from it, but for a shounen especially, it's very good. It's not brainless and DBZ-ish like Naruto is becoming, and it's not a take on Bleach. It's entirely different, and in it's own way, brings something new to the shounen genre. \
Sure, some of the core ideas have been done, but where Soul Eater wins is on presentation, and that impossible-to-deny, genuine enjoyment factor. Just give it a try, you will not be disappointed. But make sure to watch it in HD, it really is worth it.\

    Soul Eater succeeds in delivering large amounts of entertaining filled with a combination of fine comedy and action in every episode.  Aside from the few obvious shonen-ish vibes there aren’t many flaws that I can find. I, myself, am certainly not a fan of the shonen genre however that does not stop me from finding this anime to be greatly remarkable.    \
Music:\
Possibly the second strongest point is the music department. It’s fast paced and has a nice beat. I rarely skip the opening theme when I watch SE, thing that not always happens when I watch other anime.  The new\
          \
        ending themes are nice to listen to. No complaints in this department. \
Story: \
It’s fairly good but it’s not where it shines the most. The story takes place in a Shinigami Weaponry Vocational School, where “technicians” and their partners attend in order to get rid of the evil spirits that wreck chaos upon the world. Likewise, as technicians their goal is to ultimately turn their partners into “Death scythes” for “Shinigami-sama”, the founder of the school, to use for greater good by collecting 99 corrupted souls and a Witch soul. \
Art:  \
Not out of this world but it gets the job done. It definitely fits the anime. \
Character\
The strongest points are the characters in the show.  They manage to be hilarious and mature at the same time. Similarly, they all have strengths and weakness but try their best to every time. Surprisingly enough, I didn’t find much of the so common “I want to become the strongest of all to “protect the people I love”, etc etc philosophy here. To be frank, I lost count of how many times I’ve heard this recycled statement and I bet you have too.  Having watched my fair amount of shonen shows in the past I tend to avoid anime that religiously emphasizes this philosophy.  Luckily, Soul Eater manages fairly tone it down in and present the anime in a way that you can enjoy the show if you aren’t into the genre. \
Enjoyment:\
 Plenty.  After you’re done with the silly “you know what this anime reminds me of?” phase, you will find SE to be a result of clever combinations of factors.  I’ve watched 30/50 episodes and not a single one have been ever dull.  Soul Eater has not disappointed and hopefully it will never.  I’m tempted to buy the manga once it’s released. \
Overall\
Before I was introduced to SE I expected it to be yet another super clichéd and awfully overhyped show. It came as a nice surprise that it was not.  I have not read the manga myself but if there are any fillers in the anime I hardly felt them. If you enjoyed Bleach or FMA there’s a high chance you’ll love this one as well.  Prepared yourself to NOT be disappointed. \

One liner: \"One wacky anime you really got to see, just for the non-confirmism in it\"\
UPDATE: I have brought down the rating of this anime. Why? Because the ending was simply pathetic and did not follow the manga, which is still very good.\
UPDATE2: A user mentioned on my profile that I shouldn't bring down the score of the anime just because I didn't like the ending as compared to the manga. He/she is right. Am sorry for that. But I still don't want to raise the score up, because this review represents my opinion and I\
          \
        stand by it. You can say I am biased. So read this review with this in mind...\
I would advise checking out the manga, but the anime has been a rushed let-down at the end.\
\
- [ Story - 6 ] -\
Soul Eater revolves about the Weapon named Soul Eater and his (yes, it's a guy) technician called Maka. Weapons usually have a human form, and transform into the weapon form when required. Soul Eater is in fact a scythe. The point of the anime is that Technicians use Weapons to hunt down evil souls called Eggs of Kishins. These evil souls are then absorbed by the weapons. After 99 souls + 1 witch's soul is consumed, the weapon turns into a Death Scythe which is more powerful. The Technicians and Weapons are students of Shibusen Academy, headed by the grim reaper, Shinigami-Sama.\
As you will see, there are some resemblences to Bleach. Zanpakutou, Shinigami, Hollows are replaced by Weapons, Technicians and Kishin.\
However, in my opinion, Soul Eater is much better than Bleach. There is much more humor, and the pace of the story is slower and better. In Bleach for example, fights can last for episodes on end. Not in Soul Eater. There is also less seriousness and the fights are a bit toned down. The blood is still there though.\
The good points is that Soul Eater contains its fair share of action, suspence and fun. Also the plot is not very linear, and not always fights-focussed. I appreciated the breaks, eg. the Excalibur episodes really makes you laugh. Each episode contains a bit of everything, even echiness. Overall, Soul Eater is a well balanced series I should say.\
There is also some innovation like human-form weapons, the concept of witches, Shibusen and some other things that you haven't probably seen in animes before. So it's worth checking out Soul Eater.\
Apart from those, the story is a bit generic, Bleach-like \"people with weapons chase souls\". Nothing overly special. There are also some plot holes, which I hope will be filled as the series goes on.\
\
- [ Animation - 9 ] -\
That's where the nonconformity begins. The style is anime all-right, but not your general kind of anime. It seems more comical in fact. The weapons are less frightening. The characters, backgrounds and everything else looks a bit cartoonish. Goofy you might say. Not grotesquely toons, but there is some similarities.\
Take for example, the sun with a big smile on its face, or the moon with a grin, with what looks like blood dripping from its mouth. Even the Shibusen building has a funny look with candles popping out of Shinigami's masks!\
Due to this style, you can't really expect highly detailed backgrounds full of tiny elements. I'd say the backgrounds are full of creativity.\
I liked the non-conformism in the animation style. The way the characters were illustrated is good too, and makes a nice change from your general run-of-the-mill anime. In fact, this style accentuates the light-heartedness of the anime, and makes things better. Come'on, a laughing sun is fun! Thumbs up to the artist!\
\
- [ Characters - 8 ] -\
This is the strongest point of Soul Eater according to me. Its cast of characters is totally awesome! Each and every one of them has a very unique personality, and are totally unpredictable. Take for example Kidd. He looks formal, polite and outright classy. Just show him something not symmetric and watch the reaction! These people are awesome. I never liked a cast of characters as I liked those of Soul Eater. They are all so lively and varied that it's a real pleasure to discover them all.\
Shinigami, the oh-so-powerful shinigami has a pleasant and easy-going personality. Maka's father, Death Scythe, is overly protective, and his actions (and reactions) will give you laughing fits!\
Those characters have rather unique properties too. Many of them allude to legends and stories. Like Gorgon Medusa. Or Jack the Ripper in the 1st episode. The best part is the attacks. Kidd uses revolvers in reverse position, firing with his pinky finger! That's un-conformism for you! \
That's something I truly liked about Soul Eater. It doesn't copy what other animes before it did. It does things that no anime before it did, and does these magnificently.\
Why 8 then? Because there are some elements about the character's background that should have been cleared. What are weapons actually? Where do they come from? What about the Technicians? Are they normal people? Who is Shinigami? These are some questions that should have been answered by now. Or at least some hints give. Soul Eater lacks some character development, so I decreased the rating by 1 from an otherwise 9.\
- [ Enjoyment - 6 ] -\
\
UPDATE: Brought down the score down to 6 due to rushed ending in anime. Most elements were still there, but after reading the manga, I did not enjoy how the anime was completed.\
\
Straight 10! Soul Eater is one of the rare animes that really makes me laugh, or at least gives me a smile. The action is great. The humor is ever-present. The art is a delight for the eyes. The story has a good flow, not too fast, not too slow. There is no time-wasting a-la-Naruto-Shippuuden. It's your perfect anime, if you want to watch something and really feel good after it ends, and eager for the next episode to air next week.\
The action is really catching, but really funny at the same time. In the middle of a fights, some totally unpredictable and wacky things can happen after a relatively long pause, and really get you laughing uncontrollably. Nothing is really predictable, and this makes the real beauty of Soul Eater. A perfect blend of everything you'd want in an ideal anime.\
- [ Sound - 8 ] -\
Not much to say here, except that I love the opening and closing scenes. The music there is superb, coupled with a good animation and presentation style. It even gives you snippets about what will happen later. The music is good.  The music just fits in well and augment the scenes appropriately, and the voice actors are ok. 7 is ok, but 8 for the great opening which I like! 8 too for the catchy music tracks here and there in Soul Eater, which makes nice hearing.\
\
- [ Conclusions ] -\
UPDATE: Ahem!! Go read the manga. The anime started well, but ended in an awful manner (if you compare it to the manga). The start is still enjoyable.\
\
You absolutely need to see Soul Eater. The characters and animation deserve your view! And I guarantee that you will laugh at least once (minimum!) per episode. Seeing the trend of Soul Eater, overall I give an 8.5 for now, though it might fluctuate to 7 or 9 depending how the series goes.\
As you know, Soul Eater is still airing, so if there are changes, or if the series unexpectedly starts turning bad, I will edit my review. For now, it's totally worth it.\

    Soul Eater is a good series with a great sense of humor, art style, and an excellent cast of characters but lacks the strength to be an over 50 episode series. What really stops this series from being a great series is that the story is dull and you feel like that the show is moving like a snail on a freeway in the middle of the series.\
Story: 6\
From the beginning, Soul Eater threw you the three meisters and their weapons. These short \"monster of the week\" episodes were exciting with tons of action and humor which kept me laughing and admiring the direction this\
          \
        series was going. Once the main plot kicks in you start getting introduced to more side characters and antagonists which keep the story interesting. I would have gave this story an 8 if the other half of the series wasn't so long.\
It seems at the second half the action starts to repeat itself and the show suffers from the main plot not going anywhere. The plot is predictable and probably because the second half has not been written in the manga and it just makes the ending seem rushed. It feels to me that the story is your average \"Kids save the world\" story and acts like a generic show because of this.\
Art: 9\
I have to say, the art in this show is awesome. The fight scenes look slick and the animation never seems to slow down or I never really notice. Bones is a studio that knows how to use animation right and it amazes me. \
The atmosphere of the show is done in a Halloween like style that really works with all the characters and the setting and makes it stand out to other anime out there. The characters all look great and all have a clever design.\
The only thing that really bugged me with the animation was that the random people were just purple, I found this to be lazy and question why they make them fit in with the classroom.\
Sound: 8\
The OST of the show has a varied selection of songs which is I love in Anime. There is a feeling of jazz, rock, and hip hop surrounding the soundtrack and I never felt like I was hearing the same song over and over again. I never felt that there was a song that I was in love with during the show but all and all I recommend you try out the soundtrack for yourself.\
As for the Openings and Endings I really enjoyed a lot of them. The first opening \"Resonance\" felt like it was kind of a pump up to the series and had to be my favorite out of all of them.\
Character: 7\
All the characters in the show are very unique looking and have a nice style to them. Maka and Soul are both enjoyable characters that are fun to watch. Black Star and Tsubaki were a mixed bag for me and Black Star most of the time felt obnoxious and Tsubaki was dull but they had their moments. My favorite out of all of the main characters has to be Death the Kid and the Thompson Sisters because they were all so goofy and different from other characters I have encountered. Kid's obsession with symmetry was a funny gag and the sisters acted like two nuts but all and all it worked.\
The supporting characters (there a ton of them) all have something to offer the viewer and you can choose which one is your favorite. All I have to say is that all of them are unique and throws something different to the table.\
The main problem with these characters is the lack of development with them. Since the number of characters is so high I never really got attached to a character and notice their potential. The series constantly jumps from one character to the next which slows down the story. If the anime was more focused on its protagonist than every other character in the show I think it would have been stronger.\
Enjoyment: 8\
With everything negative I said about this show, I still enjoyed it. The first half was hilarious and the humor is something this series did an excellent job on. The action scenes looked awesome and kept me watching and seeing all these characters throw crap at each other was just so satisfying. The only thing that killed the enjoyment of this show was the second half lacking the same punch as the first and I wish the humor was as well delivered in the second half as well.\
Overall: 7\
I enjoyed Soul Eater and it was a solid series and I wouldn't mind giving it another watch another time. I will conclude saying that this is a show that you would like if you are a fan of the action and comedy, it does a great job with both of these and if you are a fan of either one of those genres, give it a try. If you are a fan of the series, go check out the manga as well because it does a better job with the later parts of the story than the anime.\

    OMG!! Another masterpiece in 2008!!!!! This anime is simply the best!!!!\
Unlike Bleach and Naruto which has a more slow and simple battle style, Soul Eater is much more faster and the battle style is much more interesting!!!!\
Story\
This anime begins as Maka Alban (protagonist) and Soul Eater (also protagonist) hunts for 99 eggs of kisshin and a soul of a witch. Maka is a meister and Soul is a weapon who take form in a human form. If they succed in their mission, the weapon (Soul) can become the Death Scythe. If you want to know more, XD you can watch this anime yourself ^_^..!\
Art &amp;\
          \
        Sound\
Truly fascinating!!! The art looked like Tengen Toppa Guren lagann, since the art itself is artictic and yet beautiful. The OST is just nice and perfect for those peace moments you will enjoy throughtout the anime. When battle emerged, you can enjoy another wild and adrenaline-burst soundtrack.\
Character &amp; Enjoyment\
Maka, Soul, Black Star, Tsubaki, Death the Kid, Thompson sisters (Patty &amp; Liz), Blair, Spirit (current Death Scythe), Stein and the others definitely brings anime to a whole new level, as they all have their own personality. Even though they are mostly phycho (XD), their battle is both artistic and special. Well, you can see for yourself.\
Overall\
OMG!! T_T this anime sure rocks. Everything is just nice. BUT!~!! Beware of subbers!!!!!! There were severe subbing problems. The sub is NOT accurate!!! (some only) \
Beware!!!!!!\

    This truly is a unique anime, but it lacks something in all departments. I found this anime quite overrated, considering how much potential it had. The pacing is horrible, the music (especially the piano score) is annoying and some of the voices sound so unnatural (Patty, Soul, Maka), and the art varies a whole lot (the character's noses annoyed me). Still, I've never had so many mixed emotions about a show. I found myself annoyed, confused, curious. bored, excited, sleepy, refreshed, amused, intrigued and laughing. Mostly because the episodes varies so insanely much.\
But the show indeed has a cool feel to it, with a unique\
          \
        steam punk style, with different abilities and personalities in each character, a cool concept (shinigamis, witches, samurais, shinobis, magic, demons) and a whole new world we unfortunately get to see and experience little to nothing of, since almost everything revolves around Death City, an illusion or inside someones head... \
Soul eater can also be quite funny at times and the anime has its quirks and charm. It's not the characters, it's not the concept, it's not even the story, but how the story is told that I have a problem with. Soul Eater's character development is frankly quite annoying... since almost everything they experience happens inside their head.. and some abilities aren't even explained, suddenly they just get this epifani and BOOM, there's a new ability.\
The story is quite intriguing actually, and it's what kept me going. Making it one of the few animes I haven't dropped midway through. But it had so much potential here. It should have been darker, more violent, more serious. One of the most positive things about this anime is actually hitting a good joke at the right moment, but the show doesn't really get any serious until the last 5 episodes or so, and these are the episodes I found most amusing (I stand corrected: All the episodes where we get to see Lord Death in his true form). Actually, the whole series should've been more like the last episode. At least the fight sequences.\
Several of the characters are just too annoying and gets far too much screen time (Excalibur, Crona, the guy with saws) and some get way too little screen time, especially in fights (this includes almost all the characters). The ultimate bad guy, however, is just plain bad ass (Kishin). \
As I wrote earlier, Soul Eater lacks pacing in all departments, not just in the character development, but how the story is told, not to mention the most annoying thing about this anime, the fights. Some of the fights could have been really epic, instead there's always a bunch of talking, a reason for not fighting or not going all-out or one of the sides just forfeits. A battle would just end, just as the climax hits. I kept thinking that we'll probably get to see a real fight by them soon, but some battles never actually finishes... it just ends.. Not to mention how almost every single fight is interrupted by some kind of illusion, dream or thought sequence inside one of the main character's head. It could have been cool, but it just ruins the suspension and climax in the fight, since they keep over-using it!\
Now back to the story... the different arcs varies a lot. Some of the arcs feel rushed, and some of the backstories of the characters could have gotten more depth and better told. (I would love knowing more about Spirit's backstory, Lord Death and Black star). I find myself thinking that the series could have been a lot better if there were more episodes (but then again, a lot of the episodes are just simply garbage). \
Overall I actually did enjoy the series and I can see why there are so many fans. The characters are lovable and funny. Their friendship and loyalty warms your heart. The concept is cool and refreshing, the abilities are unique and intriguing, the weapons are huge and deadly. The world they have created is exciting and amusing, but it could have been so much better. \

    SOOOOUUURRRUUUUUU\
Yes, that's the annoying scream you will have to endure when watching this anime, the one who screams is the main character of Soul Eater, Maka Albarn. Now before writing this review I was thinking about in which order to put the good things and the bad things that this anime contained. I decided I'd start with the bad feautures. First of all; Soul Eater is a shounen anime, hence it has shounen screenplay which is to say it exists not to be either good nor bad, it's just there so that the characters have something to say. In truth though, the screenplay/script of the\
          \
        very last few episodes of Soul Eater was a bit of a joke. What the hell were they talking about? No really, please can someone explain to me what they were talking about? I've never seen such meaningless nonsense.\
Let's swiftly move on to storyboard, Soul Eater had a storyboard that was all over the place, which is also fairly akin to the typical shounen storyboard we're used to, still it never deviated far from the overhanging main storyline which is a good thing, then again the story became blurry as the anime continued and it ended in, well I don't want to spoil anything but it ended in a way I found far from satisfactory, I'd even have appreciated some random comic relief ending more than how Soul Eater ended.\
Moving onto to the characters; as I might already have hinted the main, main character Maka Albarn is annoying. She's not only annoying because she's an annoying character, she's annoying because of her character design which to me looks like some jacked up hobo and also and foremost her voice actor (seiyuu), it was a bad choice. She screams all the time, and even when she doesn't scream her cracky teenage sounding voice is just annoying. The Shinigami was supposed to be funny, he wasn't funny, he was stupid, not funny stupid, he was really stupid. These two characters pulled this anime down a notch by themselves. Now let me move onto to the redeeming characters. First we have the idiotic ego-trip of a testosterone filled brat, his name is Black Star, his goal and purpose in life is to surpass God. Now we have seen these characters in numerous shounen animes before, one of the most famous ones is of course Uzumaki Naruto. The thing about Black Star is that it works for him. He shows no humility or subtility, he is never humble, he never drops his act even once and for this he turns out to be this animes best character, he knows he's the best, he knows the world exist only for him to have something to walk on and for him to rule. He is genuinly funny. You know who else is genuinly funny? Excalibur. Excalibur is annoying, self centered and has a bigger ego than Black Star himself, but he is funny.\
Do not get me wrong now, I have been bashing this anime quite a bit and rightfully so because everything I have said I believe to be true, but I still watched this anime in like three days. It's very easily watched, you never feel weary when watching it and the next episode comes along easily as you want to watch what happens next. Soul Eater pulls this off partly because of some of the characters, partly because of the vivacious and colourful art and animations (not even the CG feels misplaced) and partly because the storyboard, as blurry as it may be at times, still has you compelled to keep on watching.\

    If you’re a fan of the nineties stop motion movie The Nightmare Before Christmas, your vision of a land based entirely on the tropes, designs and conventions of Halloween is a dark, depressing town where every single resident is ironically joyful and pleasant towards one another. Soul Eater, on the other hand, takes this idea and turns it over on it’s head. Death City, for all of it’s creeps and ghouls, is a bright, happy place where even the Grim Reaper is more of a cuddly uncle than a terrifying specter of doom. The Reaper, or Lord Death, as he prefers to be called, is\
          \
        the headmaster of the Death Weapon Meister Academy, a school that teaches young people how to join their souls to protect the world from witches!\
To do this, one student must become a living weapon, and their chosen partner must wield them against creepy, devious witches who hide in the shadows and... Do stuff, like transforming into all manners of creepy creatures! Once each team has devoured the souls of 99 corrupted humans and one witch, they will be advanced to the status of Death Scythe, the preferred weapons of Grim Reapers everywhere. But one witch has decided to take matters into her own hands... She plans to awaken an ancient, sleeping demon that will drive the entire world past the brink of insanity! Can Meister Maka, her weapon Soul, and their friends stop this plan before it’s too late, or will the world lose itself to the clutches of chaos?\
The animation studio behind this heaping helping of Halloween was Studio Bones, the studio that gained fame from Fullmetal Alchemist and Wolf’s Rain. Like the majority of their projects, Soul Eater has solid, kinetic animation... About half the time. The animation is never quite as smooth or expensive as it is in the first season opening, but it is more or less solid for the most part. There are a few embarrassing moments, such as where characters look like their walk cycles were just copied and pasted onto the environment, but thankfully, they’re few and far between. What’s NOT few and far between are the still shots. There are several occurrences where a character is talking, but the camera is focused on the environment, other character’s faces, or just the eyes of the speaker, leaving the lip flaps off screen.\
There are a lot of action and fighting scenes throughout this series, and the fact that most of the budget is saved for those scenes is a life saver in the long run. The editing and angles can be a bit too amateurish and generic for their own good at times, and there are way too many close-ups of characters’ faces, but it works over-all. The character designs are it’s best visual aspect by far, although the highly detailed backgrounds are also noteworthy. There was so much inspiration and creativity in the aesthetic of this series that even the Grim Reaper is like no other reaper you’ve ever seen before.\
Aside from a couple of female background characters who are retroactively given names and identities in the later episodes, every single named character is given a unique and unforgettable look that goes beyond just their hairstyles and fashions. Some of them are grounded, some of them are insane, and you can tell instantly which witches are based on which animals. If you haven’t seen the anthropomorphic version of the legendary sword Excalibur... Think Puttin’ On the Ritz from AMV Hell 5... You would never guess what he looks like or acts like in this series, as he has one of the most insane gimmicks in a series full of insane gimmicks.\
The music... I think existed? Well, that’s not fair. The music is decent in this series, but for the most part, it does it’s job in the background, rarely ever calling attention to itself... Which is good because trust me, a lot of it’s tracks are reused over and over again through the series. Besides, who cares about the score when you’ve got such amazing opening and closing songs? The first opening is called Soul Resonance by TM Revolution, and it’s the kind of high energy, intense tunes that grabs you the first time you hear it and demands you come back for more, and the animation in the video more than keeps up with it. The second opening is a bit more generic, but it’s serviceable enough. There are four closing themes, and while the first one (I Wanna Be) is probably the best, I still personally prefer the much more mellow second one, Style, as it offers the coll-down that I felt each episode needed. Your opinion on this may differ, which is fine... They’re all great closings, in their own ways.\
The English dub was of course a Funimation effort... They’ve been getting dangerously close to Disney levels of ubiquity at this point... And while I’ve heard some people call it average, I think it’s great. I can normally call out a star performer in any dub I review, but in Soul Eater’s case, there are just too many to pick from. Luci Christian rarely ever plays a villain... Elfen Lied being one of the few examples... But she plays the role of Medusa, school nurse/evil mastermind, and she clearly enjoyed every second of it. She sounds downright diabolical and as slithery as the snake she’s based on, even when she exploits her cutesier voices to mock or manipulate people. Troy Baker is unrecognizable as the pretentious nuisance Excalibur, and Vic Mignona excels in the role of an overly-enthusiastic dad who wants nothing more than the forgiveness of his estranged daughter.\
Todd Haberkorn brings out both the strength and neurotic tendencies of Lord Death’s son Death the Kid in the ways that only he ever could, Chuck Huber handles Dr. Stein’s insanity brilliantly, and Maxey Whitehead fully embodies the androgynous Crona through all of his/her psychotic, awkward nuances. Brittany Karbowski starts off a little roughly as Blackstar, the hyperactive ninja who makes Naruto look stealthy, and it can be a little difficult to take her seriously in the early episodes, but she hits her groove hard and fast. Laura Bailey and relative newcomer Micah Solusod play the main partnership of Maka and Soul as likeably as they can, although for the majority of the series, their jobs aren’t really as demanding as everyone elses. Pretty much every Funimation actor that was around in the late 2000s is in this at some point, and everyone’s at least on point.\
So after speaking so highly of the sound, acting and production values, you’re probably expecting me to remain positive for the rest of the review. you’re expecting me to keep rambling on about how awesome the series is, how well written it is, and how much I love it. Well, much like this series did to me, I’m afraid I’m going to have to disappoint you. The truth is, I don’t think I’ve ever encountered this large of a disparity between writing quality and popularity... Well, not in the anime medium, at any rate. I can think of at least one web cartoon that’s far more popular, despite being even worse.\
To begin, let’s take a look at the main characters. One of the easiest ways to pinpoint bad writing is to notice that a character who you’re constantly being told is smarter than the rest of the cast shows no actual signs of enhanced intelligence to back up that claim. In Death Note, we were given no explanation of Light Yagami’s study habits or scholastic strengths, but at least we knew he was good at strategy and manipulating people. In No Game No Life, the two stars made it very clear which of them was skilled in which areas, and we saw their talents unfold during some of the game sequences. In Soul Eater, there is no evidence whatsoever to support Maka being the top student at the Academy. She never uses her intellect during battle, and the only test question we see her answer is the show’s line about sound minds and bodies. The only brainy thing she ever does is dump exposition on the viewer.\
All of her accomplishments are due to her bond with Soul, rushing into situations courageously, and coming up with new attacks. We never see her outwit or outsmart anybody... She just resolves conflicts through the application of virtues such as bravery and friendship. But hey, that’s no big deal as long as the title character is interesting, right? Well, sorry, he’s not. Soul Eater, and yes that’s his alarmingly prophetic name, is a laid back cool guy who likes playing the piano... And that’s pretty much it. I learned more about him from a single paragraph on Wikipedia than I did from a 51 episode series that’s specifically named after him. You never learn his name, his backstory, or why he wants to become a Death Scythe in the first place.\
And that just brings up another problem I had with this series. We know what happens when a partnership achieves their goal of eating 99 corrupted... Or, “Keishan” souls, and one witch soul... The weapon becomes a Death Scythe. But what happens to the Meister? What do they get out of it? The only Meister in the series whom we know for sure was able to accomplish this was Maka’s mother, and she’s off on a trip for the entire show. We know that pursuing this goal benefits the weapons, but we know nothing about what the Meisters get out of it. And what’s really messed up about this is that in each of the three main partnerships in the cast... Maka and soul, Blackstar and Tsubaki, Death the Kid and the Thompson sisters... The Meister side is the more interesting side. It’s the Meister that’s driven to succeed, and it’s the weapon that’s there to support them and guide them to their dreams, and the Meister’s have much clearer motives than the weapons, so shouldn’t it be the Meisters who stand to accomplish something?\
There are a lot of people out there who say Soul Eater would have been great if it wasn’t for the ending, which strayed from the plot of the manga. Well, I’ve never read the manga, and I don’t intend to until after this review is done, because no adaptation should ever require a knowledge of the original material in order to work. In my opinion, the worst thing about this show isn’t the ending, it’s the beginning. As many viewers have pointed out, the plot that this anime starts with is not the same as the plot it picks up towards the end. Now, that’s not necessarily a bad thing... Plot evolution can be handled well, just like it was in Toradora. But the plot has to actually evolve. The first plot must in some way become the second plot, otherwise it will feel like a waste of time. Which is exactly what it feels like here.\
Only in Soul Eater, it’s not just a waste of time. It’s far worse than that. Throughout the first several episodes of the series, we’re given boatloads of exposition about how the Death Scythe system works, what it’s rules are, and why it’s important. That exposition is handled about as well as it was in The Last Airbender. Another obvious sign of bad writing is when one character explains something to another character for the sake of the audience, but since both characters already know everything, the explanation is opened with the phrase “As you know...” And it gets worse than that, as the rules for having the souls you’ve collected revoked(Ripped from your stomach?) sound arbitrary and downright draconian. And to make matters worse, the change in plot leave tons of questions unanswered, the worst of which I’ve already gone into.\
And the exposition gets even worse as the series continues. In the second half, there’s an arc where the DWMA sends it’s students and teachers to a snowy location called the Lost Island. no, not that Lost Island. Not only is this expedition not foreshadowed or brought up in any way before we’re dropped right into it, but the pre-op portion of it’s first episode consists of Lord Death telling us... Yes, telling us, talking directly to the audience, as though the fourth wall never existed... about why they’re going there and what they’re expecting to find. That should not happen. It should be set up in the dialogue, and it should occur seamlessly. Hell, even showing Maka and Soul in their dorm preparing for and discussing the mission would have felt less jarring, and it probably would have taken up just as much time. The world-building is so bad that I have no idea where Death City is located, and how it’s bizarre logic exists in a world whose locations so clearly mirror our own.\
And as for all the people saying the ending was the worst part of the series? I honestly thought the final quarter was the best one. Yeah, okay, the final battle was really weak, anti-climactic and full of deus ex machina BS, but it was the only stretch of episodes that felt like one smooth, connected story that didn’t veer off into filler episodes or unnecessarily complicated plot annexes... Well, for the most part. This part of the story does waste a disproportionate amount of time on a “Let’s collect magical artifacts and expose the DWMA’s dark secret” sub-plot, which is paid off in the stupidest way imaginable. I halfway want to just spoil it, because if I were to describe what that sub-plot and all the characters it introduced was leading to, you’d probably think I was exaggerating. Spoiler alert: The school turns into a giant mech and tries to swat a giant robot spider. See? Unless you’ve seen it, you don’t believe me! And all this time, we’re constantly told that the awakened demon is causing outbreaks of insanity around the world, but we never actually see this happening!\
The reason I love that section of the story above the others is because it advances the two plot elements that feel the strongest. The first one is the friendship between the seven main characters. The writers of this anime understood humans and emotions far more than they understood basic storytelling, and the relationship between the primary weapons and meisters are proof of that. When they’re hanging out together, it feels like a comfortable party that you’ve been invited to. When they’re fighting as a unit, their strengths and weaknesses complement each other perfectly. When they’re fighting among themselves, it feels tense, like there’s genuinely something at stake if they should go too far and disband. Every interaction, from the bond between the Thompson sisters to Blackstar’s complex of inferiority to Death the Kid and Maka, is executed well. Even Maka's issues with her cheating father are dealt with maturely.\
And the other element revolves around someone whom I consider to be the best character in the series, and it’s saving grace in a lot of respects: The snake witch, Medusa Gorgon. My god is she an amazing villain. Her motivation is basically evil for the sake of evil, but not in a lazy way... In a good way, like Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty or Johan from Monster. There is no act that’s too diabolical for her to stoop to it. She’s also smart, staying one step ahead of everyone as much as possible and saddling both Soul and Stein with the very issues that make them interesting and memorable. She’s such a great villain that she completely over-shadows the villain that succeeds her. The long term plot involving her evil schemes is by far the most fun to follow. These two plot elements are tied together perfectly by a character named Crona, but in the interest of not spoiling anything, I’ll say no more.\
And it’s a good thing these two elements exists, because holy crap is there a lot of unnecessary pulp in this show. It’s constantly throwing new ideas and new chaacters at you, and it ultimately reaches the point where at least a dozen of them could have died for all I cared. It would be so easy to reduce this show to twenty six episodes without hurting it’s strongest elements or losing the charm and personality that’s won so many otaku hearts. Because let’s be honest, how many of these characters and plot points are important in the long run? How many of them are so necessary to the story that they couldn’t be either removed altogether, or written out with a few job reassignments?\
As an experiment, let’s remove the plot point about becoming a death scythe, and just call the main characters witch hunters. Let’s get rid of pointless characters like Yumi, Joe, Hero, Arachne, Giriko, Eibon, Justin, Ox, Kilik, Kim, the younger Mizune sisters, and yes, even Excalibur. Characters who are only temporarily important, such as Sid, Mifune and Blair, can be kept long enough to perform the barest of plot essentials. Hell, as much as I loved Eruka Frog and Free, they could have just been eaten when Asura woke up. Entire episodes could be scrapped, with their relevance to the magical item hunt removed. Take these changes into account, tighten up a few loose ends with some quick rewrites, and this story could have been reduced to twenty five episodes with a much better sense of pace and direction.\
Soul Eater is available from Funimation. It’s been released in several different DVD sets, including 13 episode quarter sets, 26 episode half sets, and finally, a much more affordable complete set, and more recently, a premium Blu-Ray set, as though Funi hasn’t wrung enough money out of us just yet. I’ll be honest, I’d hate to be one of the people who spent 60 dollars apiece for each of the quarter sets, only to see the price drop so rapidly over the course of less than ten years. It’s also up for free on Netflix The manga is available stateside from Yen Press. A spin-off manga called Soul Eater Not is also available stateside, An anime adaptation was released in Japan last spring, and since then, it’s also been released stateside by Funimation, but I haven’t watched or read it yet, so I have no idea if it’s any good.  A mini-show called Soul Eater Late show is available on the series DVDs, and it's amusing enough.\
As Maka tells us at the beginning of every episode, a sound soul dwells within a sound mind and a sound body. Soul Eater has neither a sound mind OR a sound body, and thus, it’s not a sound series. Even so, I guess I am underselling the parts of this show that work. Soul Eater is a lot of fun. It’s very unique and creative, and even in it’s more pointless moments, it has a great sense of humor. I can drone on forever about just how terribly, terribly written it is, but the things it does right are strong enough that it’s still worth returning to for multiple viewings. If nothing else, it has a sound heart, which is why I get how it’s found resonance with so many people. I won’t make any excuses for it, nor will I ignore all of it’s problems just because I enjoyed some of it, but I can still understand how a show that’s this timeless would stand the test of time. I give Soul Eater a 5/10.  \

    In our community there exists animes which receive a large amount of hype, ones which everyone knows and most have watched. Soul Eater falls into this category. But why? This is what I am to explore in this review. (Please note, I have not read the manga, so this review will be written looking solely at the anime)\
Story: 6/10\
Soul Eater introduces a very interesting and unique plot. Students who fight evil sprits with their companions who transform into weapons to fight said spirits. Going into Soul Eater, I loved this idea. The students aimed to fight 99 spirits and one witch in order to transform\
          \
        their weapon companions into \"Death Scythes\", weapons used by Lord Death himself. This goal was introduced in the first episode, in stuck for awhile, and it was dropped. I sat there as the plot went on wondering where this idea went. I wanted to see how our protagonists tried to accomplish this goal. \
Instead, Soul Eater gave us a large cast of protagonists dealing with the issue of \"Asura.\" While I liked the direction this went, it suddenly flipped roughly 15 episodes in to the issue of Medusa and her plans. It was by no means bad, but the first 15 episodes just seemed like a waste at that point. Yes, there was valuable character development, but it would have been much more effective if factored in to the direction the plot went. \
Another issue I had was the constant idea of teamwork set through the entire anime which seemed to be dropped during the ending. I can give it the benefit of some good comedy, though.\
Art: 8/10\
The art was one of my favorite parts of Soul Eater. The art was comedic yet serious, which fit the anime very well. It was very fluid, and the fight scenes were animated brilliantly. The art style used was very unique and distinguishable. The biggest issue was the dull appearance of the colors on occasion. \
Sound: 7/10\
The voice acting in Soul Eater was stellar. Every line was delivered masterfully by the diverse and strong cast of voice actors. The sounds track, unfortunately, did not meet the same standard. While the tracks used fit their relevant scenes, few, if any songs were memorable. They acted a lot more as ways to fill empty space rather than an intriguing way to enhance the different scenes. \
Characters: 6/10\
I have a lot to say here, so I'll try to keep it as concise as can be.\
The first group of characters to discuss are the set of protagonists: Maka, Soul, Black Star, Tsubaki, Death the Kid, Patty, and Liz. It seems that writers like to give characters in stories with lots of characters very specific quirks to keep them memorable and distinguishable. Each of characters in this set of protagonists had his or her specific quirk. The unfortunate thing was, some were focused on more than others. Some received significantly more development. Maka seemed to be the focus for the development. Soul fell short though. And it got annoying having him talk about being cool all the time. Black Star remained his arrogant self through the whole anime. He had brief moments of camaraderie, but never really developed. We did get a fair amount of backstory on him though. Tsubaki fell to the same weakness as Black Star. She was never really developed past a bit of background information. Death the Kid was definitely the most well written character out of the protagonists, he was developed clearly, and as he became more suspicious of his father there was a clear shift in his personality. I still can't quite figure out what's going on with Liz and Patty. We got their backstory but they weren't really developed well.\
The side characters were significantly better. Professor Stein was interesting. He went on a journey that began and was seen through to the end. Medusa had the same sort of experience. Crona had a great set of development and adventures to his character. Soul Eater seemed to put a lot more effort in the side characters than it did the main characters. However, there were still a plethora of not so well written side characters. Sid never really seemed to change, and just kept going on about what kind of man he was before he became a zombie. Death himself was made to be hyped to hide the fact that he really had nothing behind him. He oversimplified things and frankly it made him uninteresting.  \
Enjoyment: 8/10\
I've been pretty critical of Soul Eater in this review. It's not bad. I thoroughly enjoyed all 51 episodes of Soul Eater, and I'm really glad I watched it. From a writing stand point, it had some weaknesses, but I also take into mind the audience Soul Eater is intended for. I'm someone who prefers a story that challenges me - the viewer- to think. Soul Eater most certainly isn't intended for that. I can still respect it though because it interested me enough to keep watching.\
Overall, Soul Eater gets a 6, which MAL defines as \"fine\". I can consider it an above-average anime, but it doesn't go above and beyond. If you haven't seen it you should watch it, even with it's weaknesses it's still a great anime worth seeing for any anime fan. \

    Well well.. here we have the most overrated, over-hyped show probably ever coming to existence. Soul Eater is much more those than Gurren-Lagann or One Piece, which are already more than you can comprehend. Both have their strong sides among all the weak however, but from Soul Eater I really didn't find any of such.\
It's reasonable to say Soul Eater is practically Bleach x FLCL, neither of those I have been able to enjoy. I thought maybe two minuses equals plus here, but it didn't.\
The story is as cliché as you can get. It's a combination of Pokémon-esque 'collect them all' and sports-shounen-esque seemingly incompetent\
          \
        main characters wanting desperately to become x. Then we have Al Capones and Jack the Rippers and such historical characters everyone knows thrown in, and they're really demons or something here, and that's supposed to be brilliant and original? Of course it's mostly intended to be parody, but who the hell wants to watch 51 episodes of parody out of exactly the same things? Length is definitely one of the most defective aspects in Soul Eater. It could have been ok compressed into a movie, really.\
Art is the most horrifying I have seen in long time. Especially the opening animation. It's not cool, chilly, groovy, funky, thrilling or creepy, it's just ugly. The character's faces read 'please kill me'. The art of One Piece is on par with Mona Lisa when compared to this. I even got a nightmare where that freaky Sun hanged in the sky. Brrr..\
It's been a while since I tried to watch this hangover puke of an anime, and I in fact no longer remember one single sequence of music! So... it's probably safe to say it wasn't exactly great either...\
The characters were probably the strongest part of it, surprisingly enough. I guess if the show was captivating in the beginning and then descended mostly into absurd slapstick comedy, like One Piece, their quirky personalities and interactions could have stirred quite a few laughs here and there, and in the process you'd grow to like them. Now they were nothing but comedians on the stage, distant and empty shells, not symphaticizeable characters you'd want to watch 51 episodes, whatever they did during that time. If Soul Eater's plot is to be mocking and padody of shounen anime, then the character's are nothing but plot devices.\
Some people say 'if you have ever liked One Piece, you'll love Soul Eater'. Well, here's the big difference: I still watch One Piece at 400+ episodes, because it's much more than just comedy! The characters have had development. Series totally without character development are rarely interesting to me.\
Overall, I didn't find anything to grap onto. This show just fails in everything it tries - in parodying, in having watchable action, in having any kind of adventure spirit, in having any kind of creepy atmosphere, in having any new interesting ideas. Of course five episodes is too little to say what it'd have been in long run, but these five were just huge turn-off. \
The first episode most notably was such: its humor was your very typical 'BOOBIES!! PANTSU!!' stuff and really nothing else. I wouldn't, in fact, even be surprised if, after the point where I dropped it, it would mostly descend back into that, and still many people would find it funny and original and give it these 10's and five stars.\
Of course it's only my personal opinion that it's not funny, but I consider it a FACT that it's a REALLY BAD move to make THE FIRST episode in such way, IF the show later develops into more original and honestly amusing stuff. I considered dropping it after the first episode out of pure facepalm, and eventually dropped it just out of boredom and feeling of total detachedness.\

    The setup of Soul Eater is simplistic and works with perfect charm. You have a team of two -- a technician and a weapon -- and it's their job to collect the souls of 99 evil doers and 1 witch. All the weapons and technicians go to a special school run by the Grim Reaper himself. The series revolves around three different teams: Maka and Soul, Black Star and Tsubaki, and Death the Kid with the twin guns Liz and Patty.\
Okay, so first off, the characters: I LOVE the characters. Half of what makes this show absolutely hilarious is the characters and their quirks. For\
          \
        example, I love Death the Kid, who retains a serious side but also goes ballistic when it comes to his obsession with symmetry. Then there's Black Star and Tsubaki. Black Star is really annoying, but he has a great heart and his ego is hilariously big (he thinks he has god-like status, though he's really just an annoying kid). Then my favorite pair, Maka and Soul. Maka is really down-to-earth and genuine. Soul is great, and he strives to be 'cool' in everything he does (though really, Soul doesn't need to try much harder...he's already cool in every way).\
The animation and art in this series is suburb. There are slick action sequences, and the whole series is drawn with a 'Halloween-y' feel. The sound is also perfectly matched with the scenes, and I love both the current opening and ending song.\
The story itself is very well-written. It has an easy flow to it and you don't have to keep a thousand story lines in your head just to see the next episode. It seems to have a setup where you have a whole bunch of mini-arcs, then a big antagonist appears, then several individual series and so on. This is one series where its easy to go back and watch previous episodes and you can skip around without much difficulty. It's great!\
I can't think of any strong downside to this show. Black Star can be a little TOO annoying at times (though I'm sure that's just me). Also, the occasional sexual joke (*cough* Blair) makes me suggest that only 13+ should watch the series. But overall, it's done an amazing job so far, and I'll be watching every episode as the series progresses.\

    Soul Eater is by far an entertaining anime with fresh comedy packed with action. \
Story: The story opens into a more comical theme with the introduction of the main characters and the important sub characters along with the purpose they carry. However, it takes a turn off the normal shounen themed animes and dives into an action rollercoaster with the plot taking a completely different direction to what is first thought. Even with the many plot twists and adventures present, it continues to keep its comedy side to an almost perfect proportion. It must be noted though that once the story diverts from the manga\
          \
        and into its final stages, it loses some of its fresh style and stability.\
Art: Although it may not look spectacular at first compared to the many notable animes, the artwork grows on you. One of the most notable and lovable things about the art of this anime is that there is not one character in the whole show that is designed similarly to any other anime characters which is quite rare to see nowadays. \
Another refreshing thing about that artwork of Soul Eater is the imaginative backgrounds and area designs, most notably the school in which the plot centers, Shibusen. Although its impossible to say that theses buildings are realistic, it can be said that they are of a unique style never before seen in any of the anime I've watched myself. This style is continued throughout the whole anime, never once changing keeping the Soul Eater style.\
The animation is quite well non-standard especially during the battle scenes, notably unique compared to the normal standard shown in battle animes like Naruto and Bleach. Its this animation style which Soul Eaters animation style notable to all anime fans.\
Sound: I would say the Soul Eater music isnt given enough credit, it has a brilliant choice of opening and closing themes aswell as some amazing theme songs to accompany it. Also, the music hypes you up, makes you feel the mood of the anime at the perfect moment whether its action or comedy.\
Character: All of the characters, protagonists and antagonists, are lovable, colourful and refreshing in both appearance and characteristics. There is a wide range of personalities mixed into the Soul Eater world aswell as unique attributes in appearances such as the the stripes in Kid's hair and the drool mark on Soul. It is both comical and interesting to watch as these characters with almost nothing in common relate to one and other aswell as taking part in the key events of the plot.\
Enjoyment: By far, Soul Eater is one of the most enjoyable anime out there at the moment. It is filled with superb action and outstanding comedy, both balanced out perfectly throughout the 51 episodes!\
Overall: It is an anime well worth watching; great story, fresh art and animation, nice sound, lovable characters and very enjoyable! The only disappointing factor of Soul Eater is that its only 51 episodes long, it deserves a much longer run!\

    Story [6/10]\
There is nothing too big about Soul Eater's story. A pair [Weapon Meister and Weapon(s)] needs to collect 99 evil souls and 1 witches soul to become a Death Scythe. Get some ideas here and there from other animes and *SHEBANGS* we got the Soul Eater plot. At first this anime might seem like a shonen but this anime gets deepens in relation to conflict among ourselves and among each other about half way through the anime. However, the original story line was thrown away with the introduction of the antagonist. This twist really had me paranoid. This happens toooo often in anime's such\
          \
        as these but I guess it is pretty necessary.There were a number of supporting details that were one: too instant, two: was not explained throughly (I'm not referring Crona's ge..) or three: did not follow the other details. With these three points, it is some times hard to understand the concept of the anime making some viewers disappointed or confused.\
SPOILER* (read if you dare)\
[ I mean what ever happened to Medusa's soul when she dies. There is none.]\
The fillers does not give away from the plot nor would they make one want to stop watching thins anime. Most people would argue that it would be better to leave the fillers out. I say it was very nice to have the fillers for its originality. It further develops the main characters in its unique way, BUT Be warned: THE FILLERS MAY SEEM ANOYING TO SOME AUDIENCES. The anime deliberately gives off this message.Dispite the annoying content, it was also pretty funny.\
Art [10/10]\
The art was a very interesting component. There was a WIDE variety of art ranging from the sun and moon which the animators tried to make 3-D to Maka's eyes which looks manga-like.The art was Halloween-based, which made scene with all the different character designs. One will understand what I mean once you watch this anime.\
Character designs were very original. The most interesting thing to me was Soul's design. Some, without watching this anime may think that soul is the Antagonist. With Souls red eyes and sharp teeth, its surprising that Soul did not scare a little kid in the anime. (That would make me LOL) Soul even turns into a scythe... aren't scythes a weapon used by the bad characters? I really loved how the chibi was used because it perfectly defined the comedy. Unfortunately chibi was not used very often, maybe once in a while.\
High Definition is highly recommended so that one can fully grasp the value the art has in this anime.\
Sound [9/10]\
I really liked the sound in this anime. The background music nicely supported the situations and gave a nice feel to it. When I first heard the song: Psychedelic Souljam, i was completely hypnotized. I just told myself \"I must get this song\". Although I really loved that song, I thought that it could be replaced in the end. A new song would exhilarate and refresh that moment. The intros and the ending themes were also nicely done. All if not most of the tracks were original. Each track was introduced effectively and embraced each arc.... with a passion.\
The voice acting in this anime was good at times but can be a bit awkward. The only noticeable sides to the voice acting was the laugh and screens. The scream by Maka at the end was TERRIFIC. I really felt the pain and it gave me a sensation that made me smile because of its ingenuity. The sudden stop of the scream to some other tune made the atmosphere sloppy. \
The only thing I disliked about the sound was the laughter. The laughter seemed too forced or too artificial. This did not happen once but a couple of times during the anime and i just could not stop myself from face palming myself.\
Characters [8/10]\
If i were to describe most of the characters with one word, the word that would suit them the best would be IDIOTS. Yes.. they're all IDIOTS. The main characters personalities were all unique and played an important role. There was the cool / not much known about / dark, the smart one / cry baby and the really idiotic / energetic one. We got to see their good sides and bad sides. That is what I love about this anime. Their interactions with each other through their hardships. \
Each main characters were developed greatly. Unfortunately I cant rate characters a perfect 10. I felt that some secondary characters have more potential like Justin. There are also groups/character that was not fully or not even introduced. *Note: I have not read the manga. This made Soul Eater feel incomplete but yet acceptable for apparent reasons. There were then suspicions that Soul Eater might have a 1/3 chance of making a second season. Maybe there would be because lucky for us, the manga is still publishing. Talking about secondary characters, I have to discuss about one secondary character, Excalibur, although my discussion may not relate to this anime at all.\
Excalibur oh Excalibur... When He got introduced into this anime I was filled up with mixed feelings. His character is... well better not spoil it. He made me think of the my recently watched anime \" Fate/Stay Night\". It would be in your best interest to watch Soul Eater before you watch or consider to watch Fate/Stay Night. This anime gives a whole new meaning to the word \"Excalibur\".\
Enjoyment [8/10]\
For the most part, I found this Soul Eater very entertaining and very funny. Comedic relief was used a lot in this anime. Unfortunately it may be good but to such an extent. For the most part the comedy was very original and priceless but there were times when the comedic relief ruined a couple of serious moments.\
As said before, I enjoyed the theme and ending songs and it was good enough for me to watch them before and after each episode. Fight scenes did not over extend and were not completely random strikes. There were some psychological aspects to the fight scenes which makes it different from regular fight scenes.\
Many say that this anime could use more work in its conclusion. I agree. It focuses too much on displaying the theme instead of satisfying the viewers expectations. In the end, it is not the conclusion, its the journey that leads to the conclusion that counts and makes this anime enjoyable\
Overall [9/10]\
Soul Eater was a great anime but not too amazingly great. The art was the most effectively used aspect of this anime, rivaling with the sound. It would be nice if there will be a second season. If there would be, I hope it wont be contradicting itself unlike the first season. It should further develop and the secondary characters and show more of the main characters' power used at the end.\

    Sigh, I don't think I even have the emotional fortitude at the moment to review something like this. \
You see my ex fiance and fellow mal user Aymaan143  and I used to watch this anime together before she was stolen from me by another mal user calling himself Alexandervv . This clown thinks just because he's seen over 1k+ anime he can go around cucking people well sorry pal think again!\
 See, you're so caught up trying to maintain the pressure of being Mr 1k that you won't even have time to  see me coming when I finally get my hands on you\
          \
        and toss you around like a rag doll for making moves on my lady\
I'd never be so privileged as to think a woman is my property, but seriously dude you don't go around cajoling someones sausage wallet from under them that is some real dubious theft!  Now when I see you the only thing you'll be watching are these knuckles.\
 Do you know how long it took me to woo Amy?\
 Well, not really long since I'm me so of course she'd be invariably attracted to yours truly, but it felt like a decade listening to her stories and unfunny jokes. God, you know how unfunny women are.  I remember one time Amy was joking about tea to me or some goofy crap like that while we were waiting for a train, and all I could think was how quickly I could throw her into one of the tracks before someone noticed.\
Alas, you robbed me of the chance to even do that to her, Alex. There's no more apologizing from you, no more explaining in my messages how she came onto you first 'cause of your \"1k+ charm\" you and I have a problem on sight.\
Anyway, let me review this it's what Amy would have wanted me to do \
I honestly had no intention of watching this anime.  I became aware of Soul Eater after an intense debate with my friend, CosmicScare.  We were on 9gag (as we most often are), I was in the middle of educating him as to why Naruto has hidden depth current anime can't even begin to emulate.  My argument was so flawless and brilliant in its execution they should have created a 10gag just to house my genius.  My reign as King of the Gags was cut short by dear Amy asking me if I'd like to watch Soul Eater. My fists were wound preparing to leave a reminder on her lovely face to never interrupt a newly appointed King, but Amy assured me if I watched this with her the privilege of renovating her backdoor would be mine. \
This piqued my interest immediately, I'd only ever been able to enter the front door for 30 seconds or so.  Would a new door imbue me with enough vigor to reach even new heights? A minute perhaps?  No, I doubt even Amy would be able to handle such pleasure for long.  Don't believe what you read in Cosmopolitan, Vogue or whatever tawdry rags you broads read. 30 seconds requires an ungodly amount of stamina of which I am able to meet. You're welcome, ladies.\
Are you wondering what Soul Eater is all about? \
Well, there's no other way to say it, but this is pure and unadulterated Homosexual pornography. Now before you start speculating as to how how I arrived at this conclusion, I'll break it down for you. Simply put a lot of people on this site are either under-aged or not as intelligent as myself usually a combination of the two. Don't even try debating me about this my iq has been registered in the thousands, it'd be futile effort on your part, I would run circles around you mentally. \
Given my astronomical intellect I'm able to pick up on these nuances much easier than the Neanderthals who roam this site screaming 10 at every thing they see. For example did you recognize entire premise of \"soul eating\" is subliminal messaging encouraging the viewers to consume as much jizzum as they can especially males, it's why you'll quickly note all of the males in the show are fixated on it. Nice try \"Soul\" Eater, but I'll stick to eating clams thank you very much.\
I should also mention I actually watched Homosexual videos for research purposes prior to this review to confirm Soul Eater actually is Homosexual pornography. While Soul Eater didn't get me as aroused as those videos did, it definitely fit the criteria of being one.  \
That's really all I can say right now still feeling too heartbroken over Aymaan to go further in depth about this. The only thing that will cheer me up is if any of my adoring female fans add me after reading this heartfelt review .\
Please also do me the favor of leaving mean comments on  Alexandervv's page or just hop on down to Aymaan's and ask her to take me back.\
 The only thing I'll be eating is my feelings if I don't hear from Aymaan143 or any female  soon.\
Ugh!\

    Soul Eater is a relatively famous anime based on a manga written by Okubo Atsushi. Now, it is from Bones studio. So far the only reviews I've done of their stuff have been Darker than Black, Fullmetal Alchemist and Wolf's Rain and while that doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to like this it does bode well. Let's take a look at Soul Eater and see if the trend of quality continues. \
Soul Eater follows a group of students at Shibusen Academy, a school that trains living weapons and their masters. The goal of the students is to collect 99 souls from evil humans and a\
          \
        witches soul to advance the weapon to the level of a death scythe, but that's interrupted by a conflict with witches who are experimenting on using souls of regular humans to create a demon god called a Kishin. One big problem with the story in this anime is that the death scythe setup ends up getting dropped pretty quickly and ultimately serves no purpose to the plot. It's just clumsy writing. I'm told that it serves a purpose in the manga, but it is a problem with the anime. The biggest issue with the anime though is that the end is pretty rushed. The series has a lot of subplots and most of them just get rushed resolutions that don't have a satisfactory payoff. The final fight scene is just lazy, which leads to an anti-climactic ending. That being said, there are a lot of good elements to the series. It has a lot of creativity and the series maintains a good blend of humorous and semi-serious moments, for the most part. A lot of the subplots start out pretty strongly, even if they kind of fall apart towards the end. There are some really stupid action elements towards the end, but I'm pretty sure they're intentionally stupid for the sake of humour and they are pretty hilarious, particularly Death City's transformation.\
The characters range quite a bit in quality. The main cast works pretty well, but a lot of the side characters get one or two personality traits or, like Maka's dad, get used for the same types of jokes whenever they demonstrate any kind of personality. It especially becomes a problem toward the end when several characters get introduced and ultimately have very little impact on anything. Still, there are a lot of interesting characters in this. Maka, Death the Kid, Tsubaki, Crona, and so on.\
The art in this has a very bright and vibrant style. It kind of reminds me of a cel-shaded game, actually. The backgrounds look nice, but the character designs fall a bit flat. The noses just look bizarre and the eyes look pretty blank most of the time. Which can lead to some awkward moments where you don't know what emotion they're trying to express. Although you can usually tell from the context. Also, like Katanagatari, this is a series that tries to have fan-service in spite of an art style that doesn't lend itself to it. \
The cast in this is pretty strong. Miyano Mamoru, Omigawa Chiaki and Nazuka Kaori all give strong performances. The biggest issue with the acting is that there's quite a bit of exaggeration. Particularly from the over the top characters like Black Star and Patty. The music mostly works effectively, albeit not spectacularly. \
The yuri factor in this one is kind of difficult to measure. Why? Because there's a character named Crona, who is just a great character by the way, who doesn't have a stated gender. The series keeps it vague, always referring to Crona with gender neutral pronouns. I'm not sure how they manage that in the English version given the lack of English gender neutral pronouns, but the fact is that I'm going to have to give to different scores because of Crona's ambiguous gender. If Crona is female, then the yuri factor is a 4/10. Largely because Crona and Maka seem to have a pretty substantial amount of sexual tension. If Crona is male, however, that would qualify as het and the yuri factor goes down to a 2/10. There are still a couple moments in the series, but nothing substantial.\
Now we move on to my final rating. I'm giving Soul Eater a 7/10. Yeah, it has some issues, but at its core it's a fun, energetic and creative series with some strong characters. If you can appreciate the goofier moments, you'll probably have fun with it. \

    Soul eater is about three groups of students at some university(Shibusen) each group made up of two pairs, a weapon wielder & the weapons themselves. \
I tried really hard to like this anime, so hard. The premise was so unique that i got 29 episodes in before i shut the whole thing down. \
The show started off incredibly boring & basically just carried itself with humor that was barely funny at all. The jokes are always the same and they just reuse the same humor. If you take a real funny show like Gintama and compare the two, you'll understand what I'm saying. But obviously\
          \
        gintama is a parody & this is not. Too bad because the entire first half seems like a parody. The first half seems like a typical shounen with too many goofy aspects and over the top humor. I'm personally someone who likes more serious anime so honestly, I don't imagine it will put too many people off. The second half changes drastically into a serious anime with action, which is hard to adjust to because they're still fighting witches and they're still the same stupid characters. In fact the main characters, death the kid, black star, maka & their counterparts, the thompson sisters, tsubaki & soul are all stereotypical shounen characters. \
While the art is unique and cool, as it follows a Halloween style  of animation, I thought it was just way too goofy. Like the moon & sun had faces for goodsakes. It was like a super mario meets tim burton's jack skellington. I can't say I liked it. Furthermore, Black star was animated so poorly. He legit looked like a retard sometimes, and though every character has their own style and uniqueness, you just can't ignore the quality of the characters. Even soul looked like an idiot. But it's not that the animation is really poor, it's just the style and the way they were drawn, but for me & maybe for you, it comes off as poor. \
The sound is certainly very good, as far as openings and ending go, and the background music gives off a good vibe and fits the situations well. As for voice acting, I found Maka's voice actor to be nasally & whiny. I hated her voice. Like hated it. I dreaded every time she talked. Then there was black star whose voice I hated even more. It was small, like kidlike, and nasally as well and sounded like the dumbed down version of naruto's voice actor(jun fukiyama...something like that) I really only stayed for Mamaru miyano who plays death the kid but I found that despite his excellent work that his voice just didn't fit a kid, though I can't say why they all look like kids since their at a university and have adult comprehension. \
The characters were all unique that's for sure. Too bad they were all annoying as hell. Black star always went on about how big he was. Like literally \"how big he was\". Not like, I'm really strong or stronger than you but he always used the words big. That shit got really annoying. Other than getting slightly stronger, his loudness and stupidity was way too over the top. He was like the original naruto from 2004 or whenever the show started except with no character development or cool background. He's a retard I promise you. Soul always went on about being cool which was annoying as hell. It's like if naruto kept saying Believe it(datebayyo) but even the writers there knew when to call it quits. Here, he just keeps saying. Death the kid's symmetry, which he always talks about was probably the only funny part and he's legit the only character who ever changes and stops going on about symmetry all the fucking time. His weapons, the thompson twins, are so undeveloped it's hilarious. The one sister always laughs & i hate her because her laugh is annoying and almost always uncalled for. Maka always goes on about how weaks she is(hmm...sakura much?) & Tsubaki(black star's weapon) is rarely given a background but at least she isn't annoying. The adult characters are much more unique because they aren't stereotypical except really maka's father, the weapon of the shinigami. He's just a pervert. a strong pervert. like jiraya? Pretty sure this is just naruto with a different story. \
While I can't say I enjoyed the anime too much, that largely stems from my standards. I'm actually not trying to dissuade anyone from watching this anime. I mean, if i had to tell someone to choose between say, fairy tail or soul eater, I'd say fairy tail and i think that's ranked lower(or higher i guess) so don't let my negativity keep you from watching this anime and giving it a try like i did. The whole point of a review, according to the dictionary, is to give a formal assessment or examination of something with the possibility or intention of instituting change if necessary. So, I'm just giving my opinion and you should try this anime out. It's a shounen so if you like shounen you'll probably like this one but as for me, I found its over the top goofyness and uninteresting characters too much to handle. \

    Well, i think that the guy who wrote before me hasn&acute;t seen sufficient anime, how could you say that soul eater is a rip-off? It is not a rip off its just that the history is about shinigamis but it doesn&acute;t have any other similarity with bleach, this is a very interesting story with an incredible design of characters and sound effects, also the animtion of figths its really good too. Please do not believe that all the stories about shinigamis are rips of bleah. I understand that its the most popular but it wasn&acute;t the first one and it isn&acute;t the best one ether.\

    \"A sound soul dwells within a sound mind, and a sound body.\"\
What can I say about Soul Eater? Well, it's hard to review this anime since there are times where I hate it and times where I love it. The moments where I find true brilliance and moments that are just flat out annoying. Let's take the show apart piece by piece.\
Story and Characters:\
The story is the weakest part of the show, but it's not bad it's just it could be better. We have a conflict and that's good, but then halfway through the series we have another conflict, then comes in the MacGuffin. One\
          \
        thing that confuses me about the series is that in the first episode (without spoiling anything), the characters do something, fail, and redoing it again seems like that would be the plot of the show but no, that gets thrown away. It's not a hard story to follow, but it's a story that doesn't have a central focus. However, like I said earlier, there are moments in the show where I just stare at it and say to myself, \"Wow, that was beautiful.\" If you happen to see the character Crona, then make sure you pay attention because when he's involved, believe when I say that it becomes among of the best episodes in the show. Although, there are the episodes that are just plain filler which are good episodes except for the one that happens THREE times that I swear to god provides nothing and is literally there to annoy us. I have found it, I have found the most annoying character in anime and his name is Excalibur.\
The story maybe weak but the characters are nothing but memorable. You got Maka and Soul, one is the bookworm with passion and her partner Soul who tries his best to be cool. You got BlackStar who wants to someday surpass a god and his weapon the kind hearted soft spoken Tsubaki. Then you got my favorite Death the Kid, a boy who fears nothing but has a obsessive compulsive weakness to things that are not symmetrical and his two weapons, the Thompson sisters, pretentious yet likable Liz and clueless yet cheerful Patty. There is never a dull moment with these characters except for maybe when they give cliche friendship speeches but beyond that these are really great characters that I really wish I could see more of. Every character in the show has a personality and I love every last one of them...except for Excalibur. Really, Excalibur is so annoying even the characters in the show hate him...SO WHY HAVE HIM!?\
Art:\
The art in Soul Eater among some the best I've probably seen in an anime. The characters all have distinct appearances and not one character is a carbon copy of another just with different features, except for Excalib--OKAY I'M SORRY, but how can I not be upset with him when he looks like something out of Dr. Seuss' trash can. The way I look at the animation of Soul Eater is like if I'm seeing a Japanese Picasso on drugs. It has a dark Tim Burton feel to it but it also has this bright color imagery that you stare in awe at. If there is one thing I can say I don't like about the animation, it would probably have to be the character's noses. Another thing, since this is Bones Animation expect their famous emoticons but unlike FMA: Brotherhood where I felt they didn't fit, it fits perfectly here since this is in fact a somewhat dark-action comedy.\
Sound:\
The music in Soul Eater is pretty good. You'll get musical cues that sound like the whistles of train and sometimes even the intro to a Reggae song. You'll get the dramatic choir and your epic metal fighting music. There's a different genre everywhere. Now comparing the SUB and the DUB. Both are pretty good, often I would see myself switching back and forth just to hear what each really sounded like the other language. One doesn't have one the shines over the other and I don't really prefer one over the other.However, if there was problem it would have to be the voice of BlackStar in the DUB. First of all it's a girl doing a boy something that is very common but my god is it annoying. It's not unlistenable but it's something that you are going to get over. Everyone else in the DUB on the other hand is actually pretty good including Excalibur despite being the abomination of this anime. Let me just mention that Vic Mignogna is in this doing a surprisingly deep voice which is sort of interesting especially from what he normally sounds in other roles but don't worry his famous screaming voice still gets in there.\
Overall:\
Soul Eater is a very good anime with great characters and beautiful animation. If the story was a lot better than it is, than this anime would probably get a better rating and probably be in my top five favorites. Is it worth watching? Hell yeah it is. Watch it for the characters and the animation but if your looking for a strong story prepare to expect the least. I'll say it again, when Soul Eater is good, I love it, when it's bad, I'm just waiting for it to end. I definitely recommend Soul Eater for any anime lover. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to now destroy the person who thought Excalibur was actually a good character.\

    Ahh, Shōnen. Shōnen Shōnen Shōnen. Will everyone please give it a break and please focus on what we came here to read, a pure anime review. When I look at the reviews for this anime, only one thing can come to my mind, is this a Shōnen? Personally I couldn't care less, what I do care about is that this is a really enjoyable anime. So let me begin this journey into a story that eats the Soul by saying, Fairy Blue.\
___________________________________________\
A little too dramatic ehh?\
___________________________________________\
O.K. here is the actual review with my IADb rating system:\
Story: Soul Eater centers around the relationship between a weapon\
          \
        meister and (at least one) weapon that can transform into a human.  This relationship is formed with the ultimate goal of transforming the latter into a death scythe and fit for use by the Shinigami. While the story originally appears to be no more than a simple, enjoyable, quest by three teams who attempt to complete this feat, the story quickly evolves into something much more. Even chronicling two separate wars and producing several more relationships.\
The Battles: Soul Eater is advertised as a combat anime, meaning that the battles contribute to at least a third of the story. These battles have several positives but a couple of key negatives that do lower the rating a slight bit. The positive part is that the battles are well written and rarely get boring, aka the pace is great. However, this anime to many extents features the \"good wins after severely losing,\" belief, which means that a lot of the battles are protracted and feature the protagonists losing, only to suddenly gain some sort of excess hope and beating the living crap out of their opponents.\
The Characters: Very few anime produce this type of array of characters. You have seven main protagonists, two main antagonist, and whole team of supporting characters. As good as the protagonists are, it is the antagonists that truly take command of the show. My favorite charter in the show, by far might I say, is Medusa. I would even go on a limb and call her one of the best female villains of 2008. \
Art: A very different type of artwork. This all depends on taste. If you like abstract art then this is for you, if you are looking for the fourth generation (2013/2014) HD anime visuals, then you wont view the artwork for this anime favorably\
Sound: The soundtrack for this aime is good, it is nothing notable, but nothing bad. Its good. To be honest it is the weakest part of the anime. All of the voice actors sound close to their age which is a plus though.\
The openings and Endings are amazing though. Easily contains some of the best openings and endings in anime.\
Enjoyment: This is always a very hard category to digest, as it varies by episode. Most episodes left me very satisfied, however it lacked the desperate feeling to watch the next episode. Don't get me wrong, I gladly watched it, but their were no cliffhangers and several episodes ended with five minute extended dialogues. \

Overall:\
Finished Soul eater about a week ago. \
Loved the overall concept and the artwork.\
Although the ending left me wanting more. I just felt that the anime could have done more with the story.\
Story:\
The development of the story proceeds pretty well with the exceptions of the excalibur episodes.(after the 2nd one, I got pretty sick of that guy)\
If you read the manga(which is pretty good right now), you notice the anime stays true for awhile and eventually darts off and does its own thing, the ending really threw me for a loop. \
From the way I see it, the manga is taking soul eater\
          \
        to its true potential. So if you love the anime give the manga a go. I think the story starts darting off around episode 38 if you don't wanna start from the beginning start there. \
But the story in the anime wasn't bad, but like I said It left me wanting more and who knows if this is gonna have a 2nd season.(I hope so)\
People have been saying its a typical anime with good vs bad or whatever, but looking past that, this anime is pretty damn unique. There are things to be discovered, you just have to watch. ^_^\
Animation/Art:\
The artwork has good texture and is unique.  The animation is very smooth. \
The animators did not get lazy at all. From beginning to end. The animation and artwork is top notch.  \
Sound:\
Not too picky about it, I didn't notice anything bad. \
Enjoyment:\
Even though the anime darts off and does its own thing. I still enjoyed this anime ALOT, because of the fluidity of the animation, the cleanliness of the art, and I thought the voice actors did an awesome job. \
When Maka yelled, it pierced my soul, a  powerful performance in my opinion.    \
Conclusion: \
-If you're looking for lovely action scenes that will blow your mind. Watch it\
-Looking for unique artwork and characters. Watch it \
and it's not a serious anime, so expect a few laughs. ^_^\

Set in the Shinigami technical school for weapon meisters known as the Death Weapon Meister Academy. This series revolves around 3 groups of each a weapon meister and a human weapon. Trying to make the weapon a \"Death Scythe\" and thus fit for use by the Shinigami, they must collect the souls of 99 evil humans and 1 witch. But it won’t be that easy. However, something creeping this way comes, and it won’t be pleasant.\
\
\
To be technical, Soul Eater is a Studio Bones production and the animation is really vibrant but it also looks bizarre as it should be since this is an adaptation of a manga that did look pretty bizarre at first. But looking past that, Soul Eater has good animation. This is evident in the action scenes and humor. The character designs, the expressions, the backgrounds, and even the effects are animated very well, and even though it may have some hiccups, it still looks good and remains faithful to the source material.\
\
\
The music by Taku Iwasaki is really fitting in this show. There is some hip-hop, and jazz and a few other genres which makes for a unique soundtrack. There’s even a little mix of hip-hop beats and orchestral strings. Here’s the kicker, it works. I see Taku Iwasaki as a male equivalent of Yoko Kanno, I have noticed he is just as experimentive and talented as her. The soundtrack to Soul Eater is pretty awesome. But you know what else is awesome? The first opening theme. The first opening is 90 seconds of adrenaline pumping, ass-kicking awesome. Yeah, just go with it. I hardly ever skipped this opening after I saw it for the first time. This open will definitely get you pumped up with all the awesomeness it has. The first closing theme is pretty awesome too. The second closing theme is catchy and pretty cute too. The second opening theme is also pretty badass and does fit the tone for the rest of the show. The third closing theme has kickass visuals, and the fourth closing theme is pretty damn hardcore. I bet you that if Soul Eater gets a remake, any opening or closing theme may have a hard time topping the awesomeness that these openings and closings have. I really love the soundtrack to this show and it’s worth a listen without the show.\
\
In terms of voice acting, Chiaki Omigawa debuted as Maka Albarn and she was terrific. Kouki Uchiyama was great as Soul. Yumiko Kobayashi was fitting as Black Star, and Kaori Nazuka was great as Tsubaki. Mamoru Miyano was terrific as Death the Kid, Akeno Watanabe and Narumi Takahira were pretty good as the Thompson Sisters. Also, Maaya Sakamoto was terrific as Crona, Toru Ohkawa was great as Death Scythe, and Rikiya Koyama was fun to listen to as Shinigami-sama. Other noteworthy seiyus were Houko Kuwashima as Medusa, Michiko Neya as Arachne, Takehito Koyasu as Excalibur, Toshio Furukawa as Asura, Yukana as Azusa, Yuya Uchida as Stein, Nobutoshi Canna as Giriko. Soul Eater has a great Japanese cast and it is a recommended version to watch it in. But I will say the exact same thing with the English Dub. I will say that the dub isn’t perfect, but it is damn worth watching anyway. The dub has a terrific performance by Laura Bailey as Maka, but Micah Solusod was a tricky gentleman to begin with. To those that have seen enough anime Dubbed, you may think that Mr. Solusod sounds a lot like Johnny Yong Bosch. I even had the same impression. But the performance was very good for Micah Solusod. Brittney Karbowski is great as Black Star but her performance isn’t perfect, this was a role that viewers had to get used to at first, but Ms. Karbowski did improve greatly at first. I could say that Kobayashi-san played the role better, but unfortunately… this little turd is annoying regardless of the version choice. Monica Rial is also terrific as Tsubaki and she usually has a whiny girly voice. She is actually a very good voice actress once you get used to her voice. Todd Haberkorn was also terrific as Death the Kid, especially when he’s serious or freaking out. Jamie Marchi and Cherami Leigh were great as the Thompson Sisters. Maxey Whitehead was pretty good as Crona, Vic Mignogna was great comic relief as Death Scythe, and John Swasey was a delight as Lord Death. I do want to point out that the reason that Shinigami-sama was named “Lord Death” in the Dub was because the word “Shinigami” can be translated as Death God, but the closest equivalent that American translators went with is “Reaper”, but with Soul Eater, they decided to call him “Lord Death” which is good enough. Call him Shinigami-sama if you prefer. I call him by either title. Other noteworthy voices in the dub are Chuck Huber which was a delightful viewing experience, Colleen Clickenbeard as Marie, Eric Vale as Justin, Kent Williams as Sid, Sonny Strait as Ragnarok (Wha!? HUGHES!?) Mark Stoddard as Mosquito, Luci Christian as Medusa, Stephanie Young as Arachne, Troy Baker as Excalibur. J. Michael Tatum as Giriko, Travis Willingham as Free, and Kyle Hebert as Masamune. Mentioning these voices in either cast is quite a mouthful, but it goes to show you that they picked some well known voices as well as having performances worth listening to along the show’s progression. Both the Subtitled Version and the Dubbed Version are good and definitely worth watching both if you have the time.\
\
What does make the show memorable are the characters. One of my favorite characters in the show is Maka, for a Shonen anime, it is a rare sight to see a female protagonist as the main character. Making this a nice change of things. But despite of that, her personality and her character becomes a bit interesting as the show progresses further. Her greatest attribute is Courage. Soul is a guy that just wants to be cool and he actually is pretty cool, but there’s more to him that keeps viewers interested instead of bored. Black Star is an annoying little brat, but that’s what makes him...Lovab…uh, Grea….uh, how about memorable… Yeah, that’s more like it. But his greatest attribute is his strength, after all… he is the strongest member of the DWMA. Tsubaki is great since she is a polar opposite to Black Star, and even though Black Star is annoying as hell, Tsubaki is totally content with Black Star’s personality. Death the Kid does have an annoying side because of his Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with…Symmetry. Wait, Symmetry, WHAT THE HELL!?. How is that even pos… Well anyway, Death the Kid gets a pass for this. He is also an expert at some skills and he is also pretty smart despite his faults. Also, Why am I thinking of The Triforce from the Legend of Zelda series? Come to think of it. The greatest attributes of the three meisters can be compared with Link, Princess Zelda and Ganondorf. It may not to be a direct homage, but I find a little similarity regarding this or maybe I am somewhat Obsessive Compulsive on talking about the Zelda series since I tend to talk about the Zelda games from time to time with some of my friends (True Story), who can blame me? It’s a pretty popular series as well as being a prominent one at that. Oh, I almost forgot to mention, Why does the moon in Soul Eater have a creepy face. Play Majora’s Mask much? Well, the major difference is that the Moon in Majora’s Mask is a full moon with an angry face while the Moon in Soul Eater is a crescent moon and is laughing. Coincidences? Who knows. At least the Sun is happy and laughing and not as pissed off like the Angry Sun from the Mario games *Shivers* Moving on. The Thompson Sisters do compliment Kid, and they are great sources of comic relief when the right opportunity hits. Crona is an awkward character but has his/her moments…Thank Goodness I remembered this little trivia, Crona’s gender was never confirmed or specified. Atsushi Okubo intentionally left it to the interpretation of those viewing it. Death Scythe is great for his silly antics. Stein is a blast to watch along the way despite his awkwardness at first. Medusa is such a slithering bitch, but she’s written well that you would hate her. Arachne was an interesting villain for a while. Mifune was pretty cool and here’s a fun fact. Mifune was named after a famous Japanese actor named Toshiro Mifune who was involved in quite a number of samurai movies and he was most famously involved with the influential Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa. Movies like Yojimbo and Seven Samurai are his most famous roles. Anyway, it is a great homage to a famous Japanese actor. Mifune is a samurai, but he serves as a bodyguard to the witch Angela. In all due respect, it is a very fitting homage. Lord Death is a riot. I love his funny personality, but once shit goes down. Well, you’ll have to see for yourself, If I ruined it for you, I would get a Reaper Chop/Shinigami Chop for doing so. Those that have seen it do know what I mean. Characters like Marie, Azusa, Naigus, Kim, Jacqueline, Ox Ford, Kilik, and the sexy kitty Blair are decent characters along the ride, but if there’s one character that would make the average viewer cringe as well as making the characters in the show cringe. It would be this incessant ham who just so happens to be ten times more annoying than Black Star… You guessed it, I am talking about Excalibur…\
\
Excalibur being ten times more annoying than Black Star is saying quite a lot. But you wanna know something, despite the annoyances that some of these characters bring, it does bring some humor as well as some dilemmas for the characters that surprisingly can relate to real life situations. We do deal with some annoying jackasses from time to time, This anime could bring some example to this. But what about Excalibur? Ugh… I guess he’s written that way to be as annoying as ever, but still…\
\
Most of the characters are memorable, my only main issue is Asura. He is promising at first, but is a bit disappointing at the end, if you haven’t seen the show… see it for yourself. But if you have seen the show, you may get an idea why I am saying this. But regardless, the characters make the show a blast to watch, flaws and all.\

Which brings me to the story of Soul Eater, it isn’t the greatest factor in this anime. It starts off decently and becomes your typical shonen anime, but with some twists and turns. It does get pretty good at the middle, but once it nears its end. It does deviate from the manga and goes to an anime-exclusive direction, this isn’t the first time Studio Bones has done this. Back in 2004, Bones was in the middle of airing Fullmetal Alchemist and it deviated from the manga during its second season, yet it still managed to really good despite going it’s own direction with the conclusion. Fullmetal Alchemist was not the first anime to do this when its compared to its source material, but it was the first for Studio Bones, this was the second anime by Studio Bones to deviate from the manga and conclude by their own terms. Both ending in 51 episodes, the only difference is that Fullmetal Alchemist had a movie that concluded that series while Soul Eater does not. The ending may be a cop-out for some, but here’s a surprise for some of you… I don’t care if the ending was a cop-out. Allow me to explain, The ending isn’t great, but the reason I was still satisfied was because Soul Eater never failed to entertain. That was Soul Eater’s greatest strength. This anime is very entertaining. The action is adrenaline-packed and energetic, the humor is mostly funny. and it even manages to have some thrills along the way. This is one of those animes that is not acknowledged as a Masterpiece and yet it manages to entertain viewers, flaws and all. The ending could have been better, but I am not complaining much. What Soul Eater does is deliver entertainment to the average viewer as well as others that are not so average. This is an anime that’s best to binge-watch around Halloween.\
\
Soul Eater is available by Funimation, the manga by Atsushi Okubo is avaliable by Yen Press. The Video games Monotone Princess, Medusa’s Plot, and Battle Resonance were never released stateside, another manga called Soul Eater Not! is available by Yen Press.\
\
\
With all that said, Soul Eater is an entertaining anime with a decent story, memorable fun characters, great looking animation, and a groovy soundtrack with kickass opening and closing themes. As an action series, it does deliver. But it has its flaws, but in spite of that. Soul Eater is a must-see, flaws and all. It is definitely worth your time and it’s even better when you watch it around Halloween considering all the imagery in it. Soul Eater is simply a blast and if you haven’t seen it, Do yourself a favor and find the time to watch it. It may not be perfect, but it still will be a fun experience. You will not be disappointed for the most part. Out of all the animes that Studio Bones has made, allow me to make an analogy. Their adaptation of Soul Eater wasn’t the best pumpkin carving of the bunch, but it still holds up compared to its original source material.\

\
I give Soul Eater a 9.1 out of 10, it is EXCELLENT!\

Feel free to leave a comment, and Happy Halloween!\

    Plainly and simply amazing show.\
Story: Its good but there are some parts where it could be better...\
Art: Amazing, Maka, Soul, Death The Kid, Black Star, etc.. their own induvidual sense of style and the background art is really cool\
Sound: The director cleverly and effectively puts in the music during the fighting and the music is really cool too.\
Character: The characters are my favorite part along with the fighting, they are each halarious in their own way, Death The Kid's OCD with symmetry and Soul's gentleman but asshole style :]\
Enjoyment: 3 words: SUPER MEGA IMPRESSIVE. lol\
Overall: Watch it if you have not, but dont watch it\
          \
        too fast becuase only a small amount of episodes out there so far.\
PS. Its scheduled to have 51 episodes, but supposedly its going to have more and which i hope it will have more.\

    Soul eater is about a Soul Organization that teaches its students how to become Death Scythes(advanced weapons) and Technicians(weapon users) who train to protect good souls from the bad. Sounds familiar eh? Kind of like Bleach or Naruto, but this show is much different from your normal shonen and ill tell you why. \
Story- \
 The show primarily centers around 6-7 kids who train in this school to protect the 'Pure' souls from evil factions that look to reap these souls. The goal for the evil factions is to obtain enough Pure souls to transcend into the terrifying Demon king. The Demon King is the\
          \
        strongest villain in the show, he who posses great power and the most pure souls becomes the Demon King. Villains usually have red souls which represents a dark heart while the good have white/bluish pure souls. You find out early in the show that the first ever Demon king is a powerful dude that was locked up centuries before, so some factions of bad guys actually look to reawaken the Demon King instead of striving to become one themselves. The primary villain is named Medusa, there are even characters with names like Stein&hellip; as in Franken Stein, you also have a vampire, a grim reaper, a were-wolf and witches. Hence Soul eater does something impressive: it uses European mythological creatures in a brand new role and it does so quite well so viewers will feel more familiar with some of these character. The setting is kind of emo and dark but complete humor otherwise, so I repeat don&rsquo;t expect drama or anything in terms of story.\
Cons-\
First with the negatives, the one thing you must know about this show that pissed me off was that it doesn&rsquo;t take it self seriously when it should. You will have random cracks and jokes in the middle of an intense battle!!! You never once fear the good guys life to be in danger, since this is a comedy first anime, it looks to deliver laughs before entertainment. The show is quite funny but sometimes it tries to be comical when it shouldn&rsquo;t be. This is unfortunate since the battle animations and fighting styles are done real well. \
To me Soul eater got  boring and slow at times, the story isn&rsquo;t very deep or interesting, most people will watch this for laughs or some action, but don&rsquo;t expect anything deep.\
Pros-\
With the cons out of the way I found a lot of pros that must be mentioned\
The Animation is superb, great fluid fighting animation, and all around great drawings.\
The fighting styles are very cool, you will usually have two partners one will become a weapon for example into a sword, and the other will then use that sword to fight with, hence you have a death scythe and technician. \
The villains are very colorful and original I thought, and since we know of them from European mythology its easy to pick up. \
To sum things up, the best thing about Soul Eater is its comedy, the worst thing is also the comedy if your looking for a show with a balance of comedy and drama like Naruto or bleach, look elsewhere. I was hoping this show would be more like One Piece which is another Comedy first anime, but what One Piece does better then Soul eater is it gets serious when it needs to be (during decisive battles). You don&rsquo;t need potty humor in the middle of an intense combat. Overall Soul Eater is definitely a good pickup if you just want to have fun with an anime but its not something you will get sucked into by the story, with that said I did enjoy this show. \

    Soul Eater is a fresh, exciting anime that you've probably never watch anything like it. The action, plot, characters, and comedy are all top-notch quality. And everything is polished to almost perfection. When you watch it, you'll never know what's gonna happen next.\
That is, until you finish the first half. \
Imagine a train, going at an insanely high speed. Feels like it's gonna lift itself of the rail, and fly into the sky like a majestic shooting star, but then it all cascade down like a rain of tears and disappointment. The simple reason is because the anime caught up with the manga, so they\
          \
        had to improvise. It didn't go well. \
(don't worry, no spoilers) The anime lost it's charm, it's excitement, and finally the anime ends with a terrible ending. Soul Eater disappointed me more than I disappointed my parents.\
These are just my opinion on the second half of the anime. I suggest you watch it yourself. And after you finish Soul Eater, I also suggest reading the manga to get the bitter aftertaste of the ending out of your mouth.\

    When I first read the manga I know it's the best thing for me since I love adventure anime the characters were also quite funny well some of it, what I can say about this anime it that it's not dull and not to much on perverted moments.\
The opening and ending song matches the show perfectly no doubt about it, I quite like the opening, the 1st Opening Resonance sang by T.M.Revolution 2nd Opening Papermoon sang by Tommy February6 in other words the music video was totally awesome! This is a must watch anime!\

    Av: How's it?\
NK: Going pretty well.  Just going through my anime list right now, making sure it's all in order.  It's been a while since I've maintained it.\
Av: Thanks to school, eh?  Find anything interesting?\
NK: Yes, actually.  It's fun to see when I've watched anime.  I have three or four series during the semester, then during breaks there's just series after series.\
Av: Speaking of, you watched Soul Eater last summer, right?\
NK: Yeah.  Took a while to get through, but we did.\
Av: You like it?\
NK: Well, let's see.  I have a wall scroll with the main characters on it,\
          \
        a messenger bag and an Excalibur plush, and also the DVD cover signed by Travis, Vic and Colleen.  You tell me.\
Av: Revising question, then.  What'd you rate it?\
NK: 9 out of 10.\
Av: No 10?\
NK: Nope.  It was promising for a while.  The series was incredible.  Then either the director forgot he only had a few episodes left, or they decided to have Disney write the script.  I've never seen so much stuff piled in to that small a space, and you've seen my room.  Add in that little speech Maka gives at the end of the final episode, and the series just feels like it builds up to a fat disappointment.\
Av: So, another case of \"Oh, crap, the series is ending, but the manga's not close to finished,\" eh?\
NK: I really wish anime producers would stop that.  Either come up with a plan for the anime adaptation all at once, or wait for the series to be near finished.  Wasn't Negima! enough evidence of how not to end an anime adaptation of a continuous manga?\
Av: Very true.\
NK: At least most of the characters were intact at the end of the series.\
Av: There was one that wasn't?\
NK: Kind of.  I though Death the Kid started acting a bit strange in the last few episodes, but that's probably me just being nit-picky.  It was still a really fun series to watch.\
Av: Well, the characters must have been good for you to nit-pick like that.\
NK: Oh, yeah.  Even the characters I hated were done well.  Even Naruto's long lost brother.\
Av: Who?\
NK: Black Star.  He does tend to grow on you at the end, but he's still really annoying.  I really feel bad for Tsubaki.  Then there's Medusa, who is designed to be hated.  She is really an amazing character, though.\
Av: Should I brace myself for a dub lecture?  I know you've harped on many a dub.\
NK: This was a really great dub, actually.  Granted, I was a little concerned with Monica Rial playing Tsubaki at first, but her voice is so soft, it's hard to believe it at first, especially comparing her voice to Coopa's or Renge's.\
Av: Well, that's about it.  Obviously I shouldn't be asking about art or music.  You have the OST and all, plus the wall scroll and messenger bag.\
NK: What? Don't like the sarcasm being thrown back at you?\
Av: Shut it.  Just get to your recommendations.\
NK: There's enough action to keep that part of the shounen crowd busy, as you're well aware of.\
Av: Not that much.\
NK: That's because there's *gasp* character development!  I was honestly surprised, seeing as how it's listed as a shounen anime.  Those, like me, who actually care about the characters more than anything else will find a lot to like here.\
Av: So...that pretty much covers every one.\
NK: Except the pervs, yeah.\
Av: Not many anime you can say that for, eh?\
NK: Unfortunately.  Though anyone else should brace themselves for the ending.  It feels kinda flat compared to the rest of the series.\
Av: Well, now that you've watched your one shounen anime for the year, what's next?  Air?\
NK: K-ON!, of course.  Air comes during winter break.\
Av: Good lord.  You really need to stop finding these Slice of Life anime.\
NK: Correction: I need to find series not made by the same people.\
Av: You have fun with that.\

    I didn't hate this anime, it definitely kept me engaged and interested until the end. But the ending really killed me. What a cop out in my opinion- it almost made me feel like watching 50 episodes was a waste of time.\
I enjoyed the style/art and some of the characters were cool and make me laugh (notably Excalibur and Death the Kid). I fall into the camp of people though that hate Blackstar. He really annoyed me.\

    Soul Eater came out around the same time as some of the other \"shinigami\" anime got popular, yet it still stands out on it's own. \
The animation is different from the average anime (but not to the creepy extreme of One Piece), it adds a unique touch to the series, especially the characters. \
The music is also amazing, especially the first opening.  \
Story: The first arc of the series is captivating. Full of action, comedy, and character development. It has a good balance of lighter and darker moments. We get to know the main characters, their strengths and weaknesses. The filler episodes usually involve\
          \
        Excalibur, the first such episode is still one of my favourites, but it got a little old after the second one. \
The first arc, which is about the first 26 or so episodes, are amazing. The series should have had the final battle at this point, or continue in that way, but alas it did not. There are plenty of ways the stories could have continued from this point on, without introducing characters that don't develop and could easily vanish without being noticed. The first arc gains a 10/10 on all fronts!\
However, all of these good qualities are somewhat lost in the second arc. The story of the second arc seemed forced, and wasn't all that interesting, dragging on for pretty much all of it. There are all these demonic tools and the mysterious Eibon, which seem like they're going somewhere interesting, but really aren't. Medusa comes back, but really the series could have gone on well if she didn't. Her role was small, and overall unnecessary. The addition of the new deathscythes is also a bit forced and unessential. Besides Mary, they just seem to fill roles existing characters could have filled. \
Arachne isn't anything special either. Mosquito provided one good battle scene, and left some \"foreshadowing\" that he had stronger forms, hinting that perhaps we'd see them, but we don't. \
The finale left much to be desired as well. It was meant to stir emotions, but just didn't do it. The climax of the black blood in Soul occurs, but was a bit anti-climatic for something that had been built up for so long. So, for that matter was the battle with the kishin. \
His madness has supposedly spread, yet the only person this seems to occur in is Stein. Otherwise it doesn't seem like the world is in danger at all. And all of the pointless gadgets just seem to be fillers to make things seem worse off than they are. You would think they would at least show more soul-collecting, considering that the madness would bring out more dark souls. \
Overall, the second arc was pointless. I didn't care about the story at all, and just watched it because I like the characters. The best quality of the second arc was the development of Crona's character. (episode 26 is priceless)\
Character:\
This is Soul Eater's finest quality. The three main characters all have their strengths and weaknesses, and throughout the series they grow a lot. They are all entertaining, although Black Star can get on one's nerves easily. There were a couple of battles where I was cheering against him, and happy to see him get the crap beaten out of him. Death the Kid is one part serious, one part neurotic. His obsession with symmetry is hilarious. Maka is also a good character. She is the most developed, and really is the strongest. Medusa and her minions make for a fine villains, however in the second arc, her minions are only there because they didn't die in the first arc. \
All of the characters are well done. (and chibi ragnarok is awesome!). They are what kept me watching even when the story started to fail. In that respect, the enjoyment value of the series was high. I watched the last arc and kept watching just to see them. \
Overall, I recommend this series. It is entertaining in spite of it's flaws, and is still worth the watch! \

    Soul Eater. I had always had high expectations of this anime. The animation looked amazing from the few scenes I had seen, and they were also quite scary. The AMV 'This is Halloween' on this anime is what attracted to Soul Eater most. It looked flashy, scenes were scarier and more brutal than normal shounen; I expected a lot, something different. But alas, this expectation was not met. At all.\
I realise that the manga is not yet completed and the story of the anime probably took its own path and just went the wrong way. I don't know much about the manga, but nonetheless, I\
          \
        am reviewing the anime and nothing more.\
My first impression of the first episode was different from other anime. I was really quite shocked with the events that happened being a bit cruel for a shounen. As I went through the anime, it became normal and it was just Soul Eater. My impression of the anime from the AMV is pretty much all there was to Soul Eater, great animation and somewhat brutal scenes. Soul Eater had the potential to be a great and exciting anime but it fell so badly in the two most important areas, the story and characters.\
What Soul Eater tried to do was give the main characters challenging missions in attempt for some character development. The characters were sent off to missions which brought them back to tragic pasts, conflicting emotions and all that jazz. By the end of the episode, the characters seemed to have matured only to return back to their original ways in the next episode. The only character to have received some character development was Black Star, who wasn't even the main character. He was an immature brat, like Naruto, than was consumed by his past making him a bad character than realised his mistakes and matured. This maturity stayed for the rest of the anime. Stein also got some pretty good development too now that I think about it. He was quite the interesting character to watch.\
The actual main characters, Soul and Maka, just stayed the same. Maka continued to be the annoying protagonist who couldn't actually achieve anything, got mopey about it, promise to try harder, and still didn't achieve anything. She made no progress what so ever. Soul did have some stuff going on with him but it was never really concluded so his character never felt finished. Disappointing how it was the side characters that received the best development yet the main characters were left for dead.\
There were quite a few fillers in this anime. Fillers are a major anime turn off for me. I was hoping Soul Eater wouldn't have any but it does. There was one episode of just Excalibur just talking. Such a waste of time. So maybe a quarter to a third of the series, you don't actually needa watch. The ending was horrible as well. Nothing was concluded in the ending. The fighting literally stopped in the last minute and your ending was a 'triumphant' smile. Terrible ending. \
On a brighter note, the animation is incredibly good. Character designs are different, cool and quirky, it's a nice break from regular anime where everything looks 'cute' and 'pretty'. The latest trend in moe is unpleasant and the crisp edgy animation of Soul Eater is just amazing. It is also a much more brutal anime than you'd expect from something that's raated for teens. Soul Eater could've been soo amazing. It would've easily have been one of my favourite anime as everything is fun and exciting except for the story and characters. It dropped in these two areas so badly, it was such a disappointment. The bad ending also left an incredibly bad impression as there was nothing much in the series to make up for it.\
 Soul Eater to me, is not a serious anime to watch. It's amazing for when you're sick of watching cute girls who can't do anything for themselves (the cool factor of this anime makes up for Maka's uselessnee...sort of). It really could've been great and I wished it was. But it isn't. I suggest maybe reading the manga f you want a better story/characters but I'm not sure what that is like. Sorry to the people who love this anime, but it really doesn't deserve an 8/9. More like a 5.\

    So you're without an anime to watch and you're thinking in watch Soul Eater from what your heard and read on the reviews and recommendations? Well let me tell you something you should do it right now; I was delaying the day that I would start to watch Soul Eater, although I was recommended from a friend of mine and had read awesome things about it but I never expected it was so good, it was way better then what I was expecting.\
Story: This anime talks about a School (Shibusen), but well it's not an normal school, it's a school were teenagers learn to work\
          \
        in pairs (the craftsman and his weapon ,being the weapon his/her companion)  and develop their skills in order to kill all evil souls named Kishin, in the first episodes you will know the main plot and then you'll start to become a Black Star (like me) or any other character fan.\
Art: Well, in all the animes that I've ever watched most of them I can say that their art was similar to that one, but in this case I think that it as an Awesome and unique Art, the quality it's outstanding and the costumes of the characters are pretty well done.\
Sound: Well to me one of the things that I remind most from one anime it's the soundtrack, we can forget from a catch phrase or a name of a character but a good soundtrack it's unforgettable, and in Soul Eater we have a good opening and ending theme and each character has it sound, what I think it's pretty nice.\
Characters: Well we don't have a large plot, but that's Ok, since that way the author gives us a good information from all the characters and theirs weapons.\
Enjoyment: This anime has a large amount of actions scenes and hilarious ones, I couldn't count the amount of times that I Laugh about some scene or joke, their humour it's based in the repetitive type but it should give you some happy hours.\
Overall I would give a 9 since it was one the best animes I've ever watched, it jumped right to my favourite list, but it's not perfect so a 10 it would be not fair.",

    For the record, this review is for the Japanese subtitled version of the anime. \
Story: The storyline for Soul Eater does jump around about halfway through the series. They start out with the collecting 99 kishin souls and 1 witch soul to evolve their weapons into a Death Scythe. The anime however goes straight into another direction in the middle and jumps into a more epic scenario. To not spoil anything, lets just say that emotions start running deep, and battles get a lot more epic. With the exceptional filler episode, which you'll know when you see, the story keeps you sucked in and wanting\
          \
        more till the end. However the last episode is a bit of a let down, the second last episode totally makes up for it. 9/10\
Art: I really like the artwork in Soul Eater. It has a unique style to it that kinda has a more punk feel to it without the cockiness. It goes with something different and the battles in the series are quick paced and smooth. Not to mention I love the sun and moon in this series. I also enjoy some of the surreal environments because of how far of a depth they go to, ranging from smooth and beautiful to just downright creepy. 9/10\
Sound: Ok I know there's a lot of people out there who say \"You know, since its Japanese voice acting you'll never know if it sucks or if its good\". This anime gives a general stfu to that statement. Along with some of the amazing music, it has some of the best voice acting I've ever seen in an anime. When you hear some of the high pitched vengeance shouting of Maka, you can feel how much hate she has. Black Star's cockiness is blatantly obvious, but amazing. Even the quirkiness of Shinigami is just awkward and awesome. Not to mention, some of the music is beautiful at times, and scary when it needs to be. 10/10 \
Character: The character development in this series is pretty damn good. Soul Eater doesn't have a lot of characters you don't really care aboutl. From the loud and oblivious assassin to the OCD filled son of death, the characters fill their roles very well, especially when the insanity aspect starts to kick in. I also like the the dialogue which is filled out very well. The characters aren't always oblivious to everything or overly heroic, they have different emotions at different times which is great to see. The only reason I'm giving this a 9 is because of one particularly annoying character that will be obvious when you see the series. All in all though pretty well developed. 9/10.\
Enjoyment: I have to say, usually I don't watch series while they are coming out to prevent Naruto-syndrome (constantly watching episode after episode though 90% of them are pointless), but this anime was an exception. Though the series is a little bland during some parts of the first story arc, the drastic change it goes for later on really makes an awesome difference. I really enjoyed it, but the only major disappointment I have is that i feel they could have done the last episode so much better than it was. However that doesn't make up for the awesomeness the series has on a general level. 9/10\
Overall: Overall Soul Eater is pretty damn good. I generally liked the series and even though it may not be for everyone, it has some awesome storyline, epic battles, and really sucks you in when you get into it. If you have a chance, give it a look and check out a few episodes. 9/10",

    *WARNING: This review will contain spoilers at the end*\
When people think of shonen anime, they think of shows like Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto, Bleach and Fairy Tail. But it is rare to have a shonen anime that are that great. The shows that I mentioned earlier can be good, but they don't make me say \"wow, this is the greatest anime I've ever seen!\" Plus I think they are almost the same shows with the same flaws (like having tons of filler and being ridiculously long). And then there's Soul Eater. A rare example of a shonen anime that I really liked because it's\
          \
        very different from most shonen shows everybody knows. It's shorter, there are a variety of unique characters and the art is well, wild and crazy. Let's go on to the review shall we?\
STORY: 7/10\
The story revolves around Maka and her friends, who live in Death City and go a special school known as the Death Weapon Meister Academy. Meisters like Maka are paired with humans who can turn into weapons and their goal is to collect 99 demon souls known as Kishin and one witch's soul. The story is very simple, students go to a special school to become stronger. Been there done that. But it stays fresh by being unique in many different ways. As the story progresses, the show turns from a comedy with a few drama to turn it the other way around. It can bug a few viewers, but that what makes the story a bit more interesting. On the other hand, it is one of the few shows where the comedy and the drama are balanced well. As for the ending, well, I'll talk about it later. It's pretty spoilery.\
CHARACTERS: 9/10\
One thing that makes Soul Eater worth watching is unique and unforgettable characters. There's the hardworking Maka, one of the rare female protagonists in any shonen show and Soul, her laidback demon scythe partner. And then we have their teammates: Black Star, the loud-mouthed Naruto-like character who can be a bit annoying at times and his kind-hearted partner Tsubaki; Death the Kid, the symmetry-obsessed son of Death, the founder of the DWMA and his partners, the Thompson sisters: worrywart Liz and the cheerful Patty. There are other good characters out there like Stein, Crona and Excalibur and the villains like Medusa and Arachne. Everyone who has seen Soul Eater has at least one favorite character. Personally I have 3: Kid, Stein and Crona. However, one flaw I find is that some the major characters are not as well-developed as most of them. I find that the Thompsons, despite them being part of the main cast, are mostly shoved off to the side (even minor characters like Marie has some development). The same problem goes with the main villain Asura. But hey, there's always the manga to depend on. Other than that, the characters are amazing (especially Kid, symmetry is awesome!).  \

Soul Eater is produced by Bones, known for their works like Ouran, Noragami and two of my other favorite shonen shows FMA and Boku no Hero. The best part of this show is it's art style. Soul Eater is basically if a Tim Burton movie turns into an anime show. The characters have a distinct art style which makes them unique. They can vary from comedic, creepy, cartoony and well detailed. There's also the fight scenes which are awesome and well animated. And then there's the setting which is one of the best anime settings I've ever seen. From the DWMA to each of the witches lair and to Stein's house, each of the places has a theme of it's own with skulls, pumpkins, spiders, snakes and stitches. Basically, everything Halloween has to offer. If there is one criticism I find with the art, it would be the character's noses. I mean, when seen from afar they almost look like they came from a Dr Seuss book. But that's just one tiny criticism. Soul Eater has an art style unlike any other.\
MUSIC: 8/10\
Soul Eater's soundtrack is quite catchy. The music can range from being comedic, serious, solemn, action-packed and haunting (since it has a supernatural theme). The 2 openings (Resonance and Papermoon) are pretty catchy and worth remembering. The same can be said for the endings, well only the last 2. The first ending, while catchy, can be a bit irritating (btw the singers also sang an opening in Naruto), while the second ending is just an average Jpop song. On the other hand, the third is catchy and fun to watch; and the last ending is one of the best anime endings I've seen. An honorable mention goes to Excalibur's theme, which is funnily catchy as hell.\
DUB: 10/10\
This is definitely one of the best dubs I've seen from Funimation. Soul Eater's dub is filled with an all-star cast. Laura Bailey (Maka), Micah Solusod (Soul, also one of his first anime roles), Brittney Karbowski (Black Star), Monica Rial (Tsubaki), Jamie Marchi (Liz), Cherami Leigh (Patty), Leah Clark (Blair), Luci Christian (Medusa), Stephanie Young (Arachne), Maxey Whitehead (Crona), and many more amazing VA's old and new. There are 4 standouts from the cast: Vic Mignogna makes Spirit a funny yet kind father to Maka; Chuck Huber's Stein is crazily awesome; despite not having a huge screentime, Chris Patton (my fav dub VA) gives a creepy performance as Asura; and finally there's Todd Haberkorn (my other fav dub VA) as Kid, the best performance out of all of them (also his best performance ever). Everyone matches perfectly with their characters and I'm sure it's on par with the original.\
OVERALL: 9/10\
Soul Eater is indeed one of the best shonen anime ever with a great art style and great characters. I may also read the manga afterwards too. If you like a supernatural, halloweenish anime with lots of action or if you're looking for a really good shonen anime that is not One Piece or Dragon Ball, check out Soul Eater. \
PROS:\
+ Outstanding art style\
+ Fun characters (again, SYMMETRY IS AWESOME!)\
+ A nice twist to the shonen genre\
+ The music and the dub\
+ EXCALIIBUUR!\
CONS:\
- Story can be a bit cliched\
- Not enough character development for some major characters\
- The ending will piss off a lot of people\

*SPOILER AREA: DON' T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE ENDING!*\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
And now, let's discuss the ending. Oh the ending. Known as one of the most hated endings in all of anime. But was it actually that bad? Well...I don't exactly know if I should tolerate it or not. Personally, I don't mind it at all. However, there is one thing that I do agree with the fans. The way Maka defeats Asura. I mean... A FREAKING PUNCH OF BRAVERY?! That's how everything's solved!? Hey at least it's not a defeat about friendship, like most shonen I know. It wasn't that bad as most anime original endings like Akame ga Kill (already discussed about that bullcrap ending). Anyways, for those who stayed, thanks for reading my review.",

Despite being often criticized for the lack of certain manga events, Soul Eater is an anime that tackles all kinds of themes, from humour to mental illness, making it worth the watcher's time.\
Shibusen, academy led by Lord Shinigami, has the mission to raise Death Scythes in order to use them to fight numerous evils. Those Scythes are not ordinary weapons, but humans that posses the ability to turn into Demon Weapons, and that have consumed 99 evil creatures and one witch's\
          \
        soul.\
Soul \"Eater\" Evans, a Demon Weapon that aims to become a Death Scythe, and his Meister, Maka Albarn, work side by side with Black☆Star, assassin whose purpose is to surpass God, his partner Tsubaki Nakatsukasa, originating from the ancient Weapon clan, as well as Death the Kid, Shinigami's son with a strong repulsion for asymmetry, Meister of the Demon Twin Guns, Liz and Patty Thompson, in order to protect Death City from various threats while learning to work as a concordant team.\
The anime's soundtrack is pretty awesome. With a repertory of gripping intros and outros, as well as the OST and the character songs, you might end up with a long Soul Eater playlist on your phone.\
Aspects such as Crona's mental state or Stein's unbearable madness nicely flow in addition to Shinigami's unexpected jolly personality, Excalibur's obnoxiousness, and Black☆Star's incapability to keep his mouth shut when most needed, forcing the watcher to switch emotions frequently and leaving him with a balanced feeling album. Even if lacking a coherent ending, the road the characters take is full of captivating adventures that makes pausing easily inconceivable.\

    Soul Eater is one of those anime that seemed like a must watch. So desipite the strange style of the show I watched it all the way through. And for the most part it was pretty good. However this show was not with out a number of flaws. Sadly most of those flaws showed up in the last few episodes which is the worst place to show up cause then that the last thing I remember. Near the end a lot of what I classify as deus ex macina moments occurred. Now this is not usual for anime nor any genre really for this to\
          \
        happen but there are better less obvious ways of going about them. Sadly this took away from what was already becoming a rushed ending and made that last few episodes pacing feel very off from rest of the series. \
Besides this the overall story and characters are quite funny and interesting with the exception of Excalibur who I would like to murder. \
Otherwise soul eater reminds me of those zany off the wall shows that anime is know for with a more serious plot to follow. Though I wouldn't strongly recommend the show I would recommend watching episode 4 before any anything else as that is were the plot really starts. If you like it. Watch prior episodes and continue on from there.\

    Soul Eater is all style, no substance. I picked this one up because I loved the LOOK of it. It's got the look of a Gorillaz music video so I figure'd it would be at least half as cool. It's a series with an urban, rad AF vibe, but that's where interest starts and ends in it.\
The characters are fun. A little one-dimensional (particularly in the case of Black Star, a character who probably speaks fewer than 10 unique phrases in the entire series), but they're more or less likable. Each of them has 1-2 unique traits that the series hams up and hammers on\
          \
        to the point of actually being annoying, but they're endearing enough to make you kinda care about them. They're okay.\
The story and the universe it takes place in, however, are really where the series falters. There's a mildly-interesting series-wide arc to follow and some cute character relationships, so at least there's something to invest in, but the story was put together in such a haphazard and arbitrary way that it's clear the writers basically winged it from one episode to the next. \
Various goals are introduced for each character, promptly forgotten about, then never really resolved. For example--spoiler alert to follow so stop reading now yes you omg stop seriously skip this paragraph I'm doing my best okay I warned you--the whole 99-souls-makes-a-death-scythe thing from the first episode? Yeah, nobody gives a fuck. All the stuff about Maka being able to exorcise people? WHO FUCKIN' CARES not the writers, apparently. Who is Maka's mom and does Maka ever repair her relationship with her dad? SHRUG. What about Tsubaki being descended from Arachne's human weapons? Does Soul ever become a really cool guy? FUCK DOES THIS SERIES RESOLVE ANYTHING?\
Further, more-spoilers-in-this-paragraph-so-skip-it-too-if-you-really-have-to, this series has plot holes falling out of its butt. Why does black blood have entirely different effects for Crona and for Soul despite it being exactly the same phenomenon? If Marie had healing-wavelength powers this whole time, why the fuck didn't she use them to heal Stein earlier on? How does Blair have more than one soul and where do her powers come from if she's not a witch (and why are real witches exactly like her)? If Medusa survived her fight with Stein because Spirit didn't consume her soul, why doesn't she HAVE a soul when Maka defeats her and why doesn't Soul need to eat it to ensure she remains defeated? Didn't Death indiscriminately kill hundreds and hundreds of his own students in the last battle with Arachnophobia Castle? How could Azusa locate the Kishin if her area of effect is limited to 50 meters? How do SO MANY CHARACTERS receive a killing blow and then carry on with their fuckin' days like nothing happened? Why is Kid the LEAST magical character despite being a Shinigami's son? Why are other teams of students able to Resonance Link, but Team Maka can't do it unless Soul draws on demon power? What the FUCK is Excalibur? Human? God? Ghost penguin?\
In addition to all the holes and dropping various plotlines after writing them, the writers are guilty of so much deus ex machina that it's agonizing. Characters are constantly discovering new super powers to either resolve a conflict or create drama, and these abilities are never rationalized or explained by the story itself. You just have to accept that the bad guy suddenly has secret electricity powers because it was convenient for the story to include them at that point in time. In other words, it's sloppily written and there's no tension because every story arc is resolved by magic. If you don't mind that sort of thing, the series is a fun watch, but if you're a stickler for detail and you're passionate about the internal-consistency of the world a series takes place in, Soul Eater is gonna annoy the shit out of you. Taken as a whole, Soul Eater is alright casual viewing, but not worth the 20 hours it takes to watch the whole thing. There's better out there, watch it instead.\

    Soul Eater was fine. Not good, but it was fine. It wasn't even an anime where it was up and down in quality, most of it was just pretty mediocre, which makes it REALLY hard to talk about, doesn't mean I won't try though.\
Story: 8/10\
One good thing I can tell about Soul Eater is that it has a strong, solidly paced plot that constantly felt dynamic due to the several villains that were all working alone. The two big problems with the plot were how rushed the ending was, which was supposed to feel satisfying rather than just blah, and that some of the shorter\
          \
        large events became forgettable as the show went along.\
Art: 6/10\
Specifically the meister and weapon movement was really nice to look at, but aside from that it was just really mediocre with nothing exciting for it. Specifically whenever Soul and Maka would just be walking around the school the animation felt droning and boring.\
Sound 5/10\
Nothing terrible, nothing memorable.\
Character: 3/10\
This is where the show really dipped down in quality, considering how flat and one-note most of the characters were supposed to care about are. The anime tries to disguise the one-note nature of these characters by giving them a quirk or two, I.E. Death the Kids gimmick where everything has to be perfect. The villains especially felt boring, since Asura had 0 time to develop, and Arachne and Medusa weren't developed at all... for some reason.\
Enjoyment: 6/10\
Weak characters really hinder how enjoyable an anime is when you not only can't relate to any of them, but when you don't enjoy any of them as people. I don't plan on rewatching this show, and I don't want to even consider it for a long time.\
Overall: 6/10\
It's alright I guess, I'd watch it if you're curious about what the hype is all about, but I personally found the anime disappointing and generic.\

    I've started watching Soul Eater so many times before but I always ended up dropping it.  Finally, after forcing myself to queue it up on my computer, I've finally finished it.  What I can say is, overall, Soul Eater is an enjoyable anime with plenty of action and an interesting world to follow.  However, as much as I think the anime is enjoyable, I rate it as just being okay.  Here are a few reasons why:\
Story:\
The idea of Soul Eater is great and I was intrigued from the start by the idea, but then it just goes flat really quickly. \
          \
        Part of it may be the humor.  I'm usually a fan of comedy and action mixing together, but Soul Eater seemed to be trying too hard to be funny.  The humor, in my opinion, was too childish and most times I found it an utter waste of time.  Also, the plot of Soul Eater will drag and then all of a sudden pick up speed and keep you hooked and then will drag yet again.  It's those dull moments that made me drop this anime so many times.  So, if you want something that makes you feel like you need to keep watching...then this anime might not be it.\
Characters:\
The characters are all unique and each have their own strengths and weaknesses, which is refreshing and well-done for an anime...however I found I wasn't really connecting with the characters.  I believe this is because you never really get to know the characters.  So much of what made them who they are like their past or where they came from is vaguely touched upon.  I felt like they missed so much opportunity by just dangling so colorful backstories in front of you but never going deep enough with them.  I haven't read the manga, so maybe the characters are more lovable in the manga.  I felt like I wanted to love the characters, but I was constantly feeling meh towards them.\
Art:\
The art is unique, which is one thing I'll give Soul Eater.  Sometimes the motions seemed over-exaggerated, but the anime makes the style work so I didn't mind.  The characters' expressions were also awesome and when the anime expresses \"madness\" the visuals are the absolute best!\
In closing, I would recommend to give Soul Eater a try.  You may end up immediately hooked or you'll end up like me, starting it then dropping it until you finally force yourself through those 51 episodes.\

    In an anime world filled with stories surrounding shinigami it is often difficult to sift out what is worth watching and what to avoid. After hearing countless comparisons to Bleach and other such shows and witnessing its popularity rise at an astounding rate, I was immediately skeptical of Soul Eater. After having recently finished watching the 32nd episode raw the other day I feel as though my transformation from skeptic to believer is complete, and I will extrapolate on why.\
The first few episodes of Soul Eater are really nothing to write home about, and honestly almost turned me off to the show. The animation was\
          \
        impressive, certainly, and their were some well done action scenes and timely humorous episodes, but it didn't really seem to be going anywhere. The two aspects of the show that really made me want to keep watching, however, were the music (somewhat reminiscent of Bleach, though even better at setting the mood), and the dark and strange world that the show takes place in. After a few episodes however, the story began to pick up and the strengths of Soul Eater really began to shine through. \
One of the best things the show has going for it, especially in the first 26 episodes, is the pacing. There was practically no filler (apart from an episode regarding excalibur, which although many hated, I found to be hilarious), and the flashbacks did not go to the extremes of shows like Naruto and Bleach, keeping the viewers intrigued but not bored. The characters are well rounded and all are interesting in their own ways, especially in their neurotic intracacies (Death the Kidd being a perfect example). The humor is often and yet not overpresent, as the storyline remains fairly serious, and the characters combine enough realistic traits with ideal and heroic behavior to be excellent protagonists in the story. \
Perhaps the crowning aspect of Soul Eater, as I mentioned before, is the lack of filler episodes, and while I feel that as of late this may be wavering a bit (episode 31 was the only one that really had me on the edge of my seat), I still look forward to a new one every week, and the story is progressing quite nicely. Soul Eater is a very original series in a time in anime filled with copycats and unnecessarily drawn out shows, and it is a most welcome and entertaining change. \

    I started Soul Eater feeling fairly ambivalent, thinking that it would disappoint eventually and it was simply a matter of time.  Real life got in the way for a bit, but I amassed a backlog, got a kendo injury and while immobile, I decided this was the time to catch up.  That was a hell of a good marathon; in fact it's literally years since I was so gripped by anything and now I've finally cleared the decks and finished it, I am unusually satisfied.\
I can't help comparing Soul Eater to Bleach on some level.  Cards on the table: I lost almost\
          \
        all interest in Bleach when I realised it was basically going on perpetually, but I found the initial premise interesting, if silly, and to this day I see Tite Kubo's character designs as absolutely superb.  Other than the fact that it's an action series full of Shinigami, there's not a lot in common that I can see.\
Skipping the plot summary, I am most impressed by what I can only call the sheer completeness of the series - quite unlike Bleach, then.  Something like this, an action series largely composed of single-shot episodes with arcs, is of a kind that fairly reeks of the incomplete, slapdash, on-the-fly nature common to the likes of Naruto, Bleach or their ilk.  A tightly formed storyline and true plot resolution is not something I expected.  Not only that, the series' look and feel are similarly rounded and fleshed-out.\
The heart of the thing is of course the characters, and Ookubo's single best idea of the whole series is to pair up the protagonists, and have the pairs composed of complimentary characters.  Not only does it mean you can have camaraderie, exposition and conflict without engineering ever more implausible reasons for two characters to be thrown into a situation, it also ensures that you can have a wide range of different characters and not end up hating a pairing or an episode devoted to one particular pair, because whichever characters you don't like (and you can be sure there will be some), they are accompanied by one who is generally speaking opposite in most respects.  For myself, I initially found Black Star fairly insufferable, but I really like Tsubaki, so from being an annoyance that accompanied Tsubaki, he gradually became bearable, and as he developed I came to realise that his constant self-promotion was essentially a coping mechanism rather than a terminal case of arrogance - a cause, rather than an effect - so I got more and more interested in him.  \
The closeness of weapons and meisters is in itself an engaging facet of the series, and makes a somewhat refreshing change from the constantly ambivalent trust/betrayal relationship many allies tend to have in action narratives.  The only possible exception is Death the Kid, who I simply cannot like, thanks to his obsession with symmetry getting in the way of any sort of actual character trait, and Liz and Patty, who are too ill-defined to provide an effective character contrast to Death the Kid or to actually provide any opposition or conflict in their relationship with him (although I am somewhat fond of them).  Then again, others I know really like him and hate Maka, who I rather like.  Allied to this oppositional pairing, there is the fact that all the major characters are both flawed and powerful, and that they are more than simply the sum of those flaws and abilities; they seem much more plausible and sympathetic as a result.  It takes all sorts to make a world, as the saying goes, and the characterisation of this series tends to prove that.  An interesting side note: most meister/weapon pairs are of mixed gender, but not all.\
While weapons and meisters are effectively immune to ambiguity, there are plenty of other characters who are not, and these are some of the best; naming names here risks spoilers so you'll have to find these yourself.  The villains are also interesting; in fact they are at times much fresher and more intriguing than the protagonist ensemble, who for all their appeal do nonetheless represent a very familiar set of archetypes, remixed and covered endlessly in much the same way we keep hearing classic musical hits made over by new acts.  The appeal of the antagonists is largely due to Soul Eater's mastery of the ability to walk the fine line between either overdoing things and hence obscuring a potentially interesting plot behind needless gore (c.f. something like Mnemosyne) or being excessively tame and not actually creating anything like a real sense of threat to drive the story (c.f. something like Heroic Age).  Soul Eater's antagonists therefore come across as ruthless, psychotic bastards, but in the very best way, in that they remain somewhat sympathetic for all their carefully constructed nastiness, and everything is tastefully handled.  The voice acting is universally praiseworthy; only the characters who are meant to grate on your nerves actually do, and everyone else's voice is natural and well-realised.\
Art in this series is a peculiar mixture.  The lack of a universal style, beyond an eyecatching fondness for arrows that tends to crop up a lot, I found really disconcerting at first, until it hit me that the blend of styles was in itself a style; the sheer diversity of styles across the end credit music, spanning punk, pop, rap/hiphop/whatever the hell you want to call ED#3 and rock, and in fact the eclectic mix of instruments and styles in the BGM, all fit this unexpectedly tasty gumbo of styles too.  Accordingly, the light-toned action baseline episode format also frequently switches over into knowingly cheesy horror, engaging seriousness, pure comedy interludes (unique for a character who is simultaneously very funny and almost unbearably annoying) and a finale that contains enough of the Evangelion approach to be memorable without being either incomprehensible or tedious for any but the most attention-deficit watcher, who will probably have given up by now anyway.  Ultimately, I stopped fretting about the fact that every character was drawn differently and had different visual quirks, and the music was all over the place, and the damn thing couldn't decide what it wanted to be, but it took a while to work out that what it wanted to be was a jack of many things and master only of combining those things.\
\
As for the sheer outlandishness of it, what with the giant sun and moon and the total implausibility of Death City and sundry other locations, not to mention the whole conceit of humans who literally are weapons...if you were to describe it to me, I'd just not be interested.   As things stand though, especially given the lack of concentrating on explaining all this and simply treating all these patent absurdities as givens, it makes the whole thing into an engagingly escapist piece of work - something that is pure undemanding fun.\

    Well I loved this anime the moment i began watching it. The concept used for making this anime was different. Well that's what i think. The anime kicks off with an intriguing storyline. As the anime progressed there were interesting developments in it. The characters were great. Each one of them had their own unique personality. But what disappointed me is the fact that the anime suddenly deviated from it's original plot leading to a different ending. If it were to follow the original storyline i.e that of the manga the anime would've run for a longer period of time. Well thats all i 'm\
          \
        going to say about it's plot.\
\
Now coming to it's audio, well the voice actors did a fantastic job fitting into their respective characters. The BGM sound tracks were amazing. Each main character had his/her respective soundtrack. The opening and ending songs were awesome too. Overall the audio was impressive.\
Now coming to the video. Well the art was different in this anime. This is probably the firs anime where i saw the sun and moon having facial expressions. As far as the visual effects are concerned, well the were pretty impressive as well.\
So for the people who are done with the anime and are upset about it ending so soon you could always continue with the manga.\
According to me the manga still has a long way to go for it to reach it's completion.\

Those who want any recommendations for anime well i strongly recommend you to add this one to your anime basket.\

    Ultimately i had refused to watch soul eater after a friend recommended it to me.  But then, with nothing else to watch, that is the first that came to mind.  \
the show itself demonstrated promise, and fulfilled it's purpose of my amusement for the fifty-one episode run.  \
Now to be a bit picky about it.  I did label this show as one that demonstrates lots of promise.  But the problem lying in the fact that I found the ending to be a bit of a bad pay out.  The show had great potential with promising fight sequences and great\

GO WATCH SOUL EATER!!!! It's considered one of the best Shounen anime to hit the screen and has excellent art direction and OST, and the opening is helluva lot better, since the tone match so well with the show.\
Well, you heard him. What's not to love about this series. It has, in my opinion, the best any Shounen anime could ever offer. Great premise, Great Characters, Best OST, and one of the best OPs in anime history (The latter two guaranteed to give you Ear-gasms). Let's dive into the pool of awesomeness that is Soul Eater.\

        some of you may be surprised to hear this, but this is one of the weakest points in the anime, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It has an excellent premise and, though minimal, a good chunk of world building. I mean, we have a world where People can become weapons, and team up with their Meisters to kick ass. If I was a Meister, I'd be a gun- wielder. But if I was a weapon, I'd be a lvl-100 Aegislash. See what I did in the last sentence? That sentence alone, showed how much I loved the premise of the anime. And what better way to tell a good story, than to add good characters to the mix. Some may have mixed feelings about the ending, but, in my opinion, I like it. As for the weak points, yeah, the characters seems to forget why they were here in the first place (Want a hint? It starts with 'Death Scythes').\
Art - 10/10\
Guy's, Studio Bones was behind the reins of Soul Eater. OF COURSE I'D GIVE IT A 10!!!! They always know how to emphasize the feeling of a given situation. And when there's suspense, they'll change the atmosphere of the setting to FIT that suspense.Another strong point is the character design. Each characters are designed to suit their personality and they do it well (I'm lookin' at you, Death The Kid).And the action scenes are SPECTACULAR.One of my favourite fights are the ones involving Kid, Maka and Sword-God Mifune, what more do I ask. No other words can describe the art of this anime. Should I continue, I'll only ruin the beauty of this anime.\
Sound -10/10\
You can't tell, but my pant's wet from the Sound. The OPs are awesome, and 'Resonance' is the best of the bunch. It knows exactly how to pump up it's viewers for a roller-coaster ride of awesome, and it does it well.\
As for the voice-acting, I watched this anime in dub. Though there were some hiccups here and there (BLACK STAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!!!!), I found the voice acting to be great. Todd Haberkorn did an excellent job of portraying the OCD-ridden Death The Kid. And for a moment there, I thought Johny Yong Bosch was Soul (but he wasn't) and that's how good the voice actors are. Dub, or Subs, either way is fine.\
Characters - 8.5/10\
As for the characters, they're pretty well diverse and quirky. We have Maka, the bookworm who wants to follow in her mother's footsteps and nuke her father's presence. Soul, a scythe who wants to become a Death Scythe, but is willing to protect Maka at any cost, even if it means risking his own life (much to Maka's chagrin). Black Star, who is an annoying self-absorbed jerk, who wants to surpass God (provided it's the God of Evil, I'm okay with that), but want's to keep his loud image, so that he can boost his friends' morale and lead them under his banner (Much to EVERYONE's chagrin.). Tsubaki, the quiet Death-arms who always supported Black Star to the very end, and keeping his ego in check. Liz and Patty, Death's twin pistols, with opposing personalities, yet a compatibility so high and symmetrical, that it would give Naruto a run for his money (Much to Kid's delight), And Death the Kid, my favourite character, the OCD-driven, symmetry-obsessed, perfectionist badass. And that's just the ORIGINAL main cast. The characters, in my opinion, are the selling point for me. In Shounen manga, it is easy to botch up characters when you are busy trying to appeal to massive male audience, but Soul Eater doesn't do that. Much to Kid's delight, the characters are all compatible with each other. If they are not on terms with each other, they will work it out. If someone has a problem, but doesn't want to share, their friends be more than willing to help. Since their teamwork and compatibilty as Meister and Weapon is a must, in order to defeat enemies and defy the odds, it's easy to see why.\
Enjoyment - 9/10\
It was a good watch, but holy snap, was it long. I enjoy anime, I really do. But 51 episodes is more than I could chew. I'm used to the 26 episode per season format. But then again, this is coming from a guy who threw a hissy fit, when he heard that Gainax didn't want to give Gurren Lagaan six seasons.\
Overall - 9/10\
Now children, what did I say about this anime in my Blue Exorcist review?\
(This is where you look up to the first paragraph of this review)\
VERY GOOD.It may have it's minute flaws, but you are guaranteed to enjoy. I mean, if I enjoy it, so will you (I hope). Now pick your ass up and watch Soul Eater, if you have the time.\

    My one requirement of anything I watch or read is this; \"Is it good for the type of thing that it is?\" If it is a Romantic Comedy, it better be cute and it better be funny, and it better look good. Simple. If it is a comedy, I need to laugh. If it is a Mystery, it needs to have me on edge thinking of what the net move is. \
In the case of Soul Eater, it needs to have good fight scenes, good characters I can root for, and a plot I can buy into as to WHY they're fighting.\
And this anime excels\
          \
        in every category.\
Soul Eater has among the best looking fight scenes you will ever find in an anime. They flow breathtakingly well, each character has specific strengths they utilize, and weaknesses they try to cover up. Each of them have different weapons, but they all have different approaches to fighting. \
Maka and Lord Death both posses a Scythe as their weapon, but their styles of fighting are different. The \"I'll hit you as many times as I want\" aggressiveness that Black Star fights with is different than the tactical \"wait for an opening and strike hard\" approach possessed by Professor Stein. I am in LOVE with thus style, because in many of the episodes there are many simultaneous fights taking place in different areas of the world, making the switch from one to another fresh and makes you feel as if you arent watching the same thing only with different characters.\
Each of the main characters has a unique personality and I cannot stress enough how important it is for a fighter type anime to have that. \
They have their own goals. They have their own desires and are constantly developing over the course of the series, making each fight they go into filled with tension and emotion. Most animes of the same genre just throw fights at you as mindlessly as they can. This one does so with you getting invested in each fight, without boring you. The battle scenes are common, but the series places them strategically enough to allow you the plot to advance.\
Artistically, the colors match the mood of the series very well. Tension filled battles truly look important, fights that do not have as much on the line  look as such. Typically, the characters even interact with the setting during fights in a tactical sense, and not just running and jumping from tree to tree and wall to wall.\
Each of the characters have a great look and feel to them, and this caries through combat and non combat scenes. The animation quality never takes a dip, which is impressive through all of the 50+ episodes.\
Furthermore, it's actually pretty funny, and it's plot keeps and holds your interest during relaxed comedic scenes. \
My one complaint of the series spoils a huge battle OF the series however, so I'll keep that to myself. \
But in conclusion, Soul Eater is a perfect addition to ANY anime fans list with its great feeling and great looking characters, it's amazing looking fight scenes, and a plot that gets you invested in every conflict that comes up.\

    I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in an anime as I was with Soul Eater, and so much more so because it was so good in the beginning. The art direction and voice acting were both very enjoyable, breathing life into a handful of unforgettable characters that would have made this anime a favorite of mine if it weren't for its asinine plot.\
I started off very excited about Soul Eater, watching it with friends as well as in my free time. I enjoyed the pleasing art style, its inspirations in history and legend, and its themes of personal growth. The fights were well\
          \
        choreographed and drawn, giving points of excitement in a story I found enticing. The best part of Soul Eater for me was the protagonist duo, the main characters Maka and Soul. Compellingly voiced with nuanced and believable backgrounds, it was their relationship that drove the story as well as fueled my investment into it. Their tribulations and victories are still fondly remembered by me and the friends of mine who finished the show. If you'd asked me by about a quarter of the way through the 52 episodes I own, having bought them before finishing the series, I would have said with certainty that Soul Eater would be one of my all time favorites.\
Instead, what I was delivered by the second half of the show was a haphazardly written show that used cheap and barely thematic conflict to reach meaningless milestones. The characters I enjoyed for their emotional depth lost the stage to a full cast of comparably mundane amalgams of anime tropes. It's easier to write character conflict when the only thing your character cares about is symmetry, and by the end of the show easy writing was all it had. Worse, while this trend began cheapening the conflict and plot across the board, the show still couldn't avoid plot holes, deus ex machina and Chekhov's guns. The show past episode 27 was in tedious decline but it wasn't until 42 that I plain called it quits, all thanks to the complete degradation of the plot. This lack of effort ended up shattering its entire sense of continuity and rendering all but the most basic characters utterly unrecognizable.\
I'm honestly embarrassed that I recommended this show to my friends.\

    In the world of Soul Eater, there are people who have become evil. When they become evil their soul becomes a kishin egg soul and it is up to the Death Weapons and Meister Academy(DWMA) to kill these guys so they don't become a full born kishin, or the world will be envelope in madness.\
Story: The plot is surprisingly quite interesting. The first few episodes seems like \"What the hell is going on?\" or \"Where are they going with this?\" but eventually it becomes even more interesting and fun. There are some action since this is mainly a fighting anime, and it also has many\
          \
        funny parts. And important thing is that there is like almost no fillers at all in this anime. It strictly sticks to the plot, except for like one random episode.\
Art: Personally I just didn't enjoy the artwork that much. The artwork was decent, like not too much details on the characters. The theme of the whole anime surrounds a Halloween theme, like the smiling and sometime laugh moon with blood dripping from it's mouth, or the crooked fences etc.\
Sound: I really thought the soundtrack for this anime was just superb. Each time the OP or ED theme came on I didn't want to skip it at all. Especially the second OP theme song, it was even better than the first and is probably my favorite song out of the whole series. Overall the music and sound was pretty good.\
Character: Um, I would have to say the characters are unique, like the anime portrays their personality more than showing the character development of each main characters. Like it shows their strength and weakness and the acceptance of it, but there wasn't really much character development. However I can assure you that much of the characters are quite funny, especially Death Kid and his obsession with symmetry.  \
Enjoyment: The anime was alright, though I did not understand some concepts about. It is fun and had a lot of fighting scenes. But there was some times where I was just like \"what the heck?\" but most of the times it was enjoyable. Well I hope this is not a spoiler, but I do feel like the anime could have been longer, like elaborating more on some arcs/parts, especially the last 5 episodes. I seriously felt like they rushed the last 5 episodes, and the ending was kind of strange. However, it was a pretty good anime and I hope you can enjoy it too!\

    Note this is my first review so I may end up being unprofessional. I wil also not bring up anything manga related it'll be a separate discussion for another time.\
I for one love Soul Eater it has alot of things I love and think this has a charm. I today will state my thoughts. And if you you don't like them don't complain.\
Story- I consider it a weak point (for the anime only) because when compared to the points it look kind of lame. Not saying it is but it's my opinion. I think the story is great. I like how it dose take the\
          \
        approach of battle that some other shonens dont. They actually lose. This helps them think why and develop. I think that's smart. Also I noticed in other reviews some have said that the concept is dropped and is unprofessional. To a degree I can understand but the only reason it was dropped was because the manga was still going on at the time. Only complaint I have was a few pacing problems but there not bad to make you irritated so that's good.\
Characters- Where do I begin with this cast? I love almost all of the cast. How about the main seven.\
Maka- I for one love her , I think she is one the most strongest females in anime. She is also one of the most likeable and relatable characters I have seen. She is also smart, hardworking , and cares for Soul.  I can't help but love her.\
Soul- He may seem like a generic trying to be cool guy but one of the things he does is care for Maka and his other friends. He will do anything to protect Maka, even get in arguments with her about her safety. And he willing to help Maka's dream come true. And what he has to go through  and be affected it amazing. He's great overall.\
BlackStar- I think Black Star is at times overhated. To be fair he is a bit annoying but I don't hate him. I really can't help but like his personality. And the way he cares for Tsubaki and csn back up his claims dose help him. Also why do people compare him to Naruto? Black Star and Naruto have some differences like how Black Star dose train hard and Naruto at times dosent. (at least fron what I remember and do correct me if Im wrong) But overall I think he's good.\
Tsubaki- She really was great too. She always try to find the good in people and wants Black Star to succeed. I also cried alot during her back story. She is just great overall.\
Death the Kid- Hate to say this but he is overrated. Im not saying he isn't funny or cool. I do think he's good. But he can go overboard and just makes me ask at times why. Still though at the  end of the day its just symmetry so he's not worth all the hype. But he's still good.\
Patty- She makes me smile and laugh alot. I really can't help but laugh at her jokes. She was nice as comic relief.\
Liz- I hate her. She is whiny ,complains to Kid when he saved them both , and is at times a bitch. She has a few good qualities but she still is a snob. \
Most of the side characters and antagonists all range from ok for a few and great for most minus Excalibur who is annoying as hell.\
Animation + art- Its strong from Bones. I think Bones is the strongest when it comes to animation and Soul Eater is no exception. Its all smooth and amazing looking on Blue Ray. No complaints here. As for art, its amazing and one of my favorite styles\
Soundtrack + VA\
Soul Eater has a great soundtrack I love the mixture of genres and is catchy especially the first opening Resonance. There are a few tracks that are annoying but its still worth a listen. The VA for the dub is good. I don't think its Funimations best but its still nice.\
Overrall I love it, Im glad its great and its enjoyable. Sure a few annoying characters and crappy ending but I still love it. It gets an 8 in the score but its still in my top five.\

    Soul Eater - \
The first thing you'll notice about this anime, especially if you are watching this in high resolution, is the amazing art you will see.  Fantastic.\
\
Story: I was a bit touch and go with this anime.  I dropped it after the first 4 episodes and then decided to pick it up again and then dropped it again.  The story is a bit unique in my opinion.. I haven't seen an anime/manga yet that has a similar story line.  The story tends to jump around  a lot - Excalibur? Seriously, wtf?  They could of cut that easily and\
          \
        saved two episodes.  It just seems like its taking the writers too long to explain the main story.  From what I've heard it also tries to change into a more dramatic anime half way in the series.  \
Art: Art is amazing.  Not only is the art great but there is great camera direction which is one of the things that'll get me to keep watching an anime.\
Sound:  I don't really like to review sound in anime .. you'd think i'd be interested in it since I'm studying record engineering .  But if I were to, I'd say that the voice actors did a fine job.\
Characters:  The main characters I liked a lot - their relationships and build up were well written.  The side characters I could of easily done with out, looking at you Excalibur.  I also dropped this anime 20 episodes into it because I sort of lost that excitement that I got from the characters - they were starting to become more annoying than the intial \"Wow\" that I got from them.  \
Enjoyment:  As I've said before - I found myself to enjoy this anime .. at least until it started becoming a more dramatic series and disrupting the original flow of the anime even more so than it already has.\
Overall: Take a few test watches for a few episodes.. It might be a bit hard to get into but it may not.  It ended up becoming a so so anime to me because of the dramatic change and the lack of enjoyment I got out of the characters in the middle of the series.     \

    What the hell happened to this anime? Started so strong, but the end was a huge disappointment.\
But now I'll give you a reason, what made me to scream at this anime so much. I really wanted to like this anime, really. But watching this after reading the manga ruined it to me. The manga was so, so much better. (I have to say, original wins always in my opinion) The voice acting, characters, music and are still fantastic, but the plot kinda ruined it. I liked everything but the FREAKING PLOT. After watching halfway through, it gets shitty compared to the manga.\

    First the anime should not even be called Soul Eater, but '' Maka '' needed 51 episodes to settle for the real protagonist, and poor Soul becomes a mere adjunct. The anime itself could have been better, but slips in the old cliches of action shounens on the other hand the art of anime is what captivates, is what draws more attention, since the end result is kind of disappointing, the end is bland with a huge question.\

If Soul Eater's world were real, I'd totally move in immediately!!!\

        she looked.\
However, I'm glad they didn't have her look too fierce other wise, it wouldn't have been interesting.\

Story (7/10)\
Let's talk for a moment about pacing. Pacing is the rate at which a story progresses; the speed at which the plot develops can make or break any narrative effort, but appears to me to be an acute issue in anime. The deft, non-linear approach of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni keeps its viewers on the edge of their seats. Conversely, the plodding half-formed yarn of Aoi Hana withers when almost nothing happens (even by the statue-speed standards of yuri romance, that anime fails). Of all anime, shounen shows tend to embody the worst practices of uneven storytelling: Dragon Ball Z is so ponderous that the remastered Dragon Ball Kai manages with 1/3 the original's air time; Naruto, an otherwise fun and action-packed romp, stuffs its final EIGHTY episodes with filler. EIGHTY--and don't even mention Bleach. Then, comes Soul Eater. The series' tight, energetic approach stands out despite the show's heavily derivative feel. Fifty-two half-hour segments rarely yields as satisfying experience overall. Especially in this genre.\
That said, Soul Eater offers little original to anime as far as its story goes. A special school devoted to training warriors? Naruto. A virtuous organization of supernatural fighters trying to prevent humans from turning into demons? D.Gray Man. And the writers stuffed the cast with tropes borrowed from well-known horror works. Mad Doctor? Check. Zombie? Check. Werewolf? Check. Witches? Double-check. In the end, the series' execution sets it apart from its copycat foundations. After a brief set of explicit introductions, the story gets on the rails to placing the its child protagonists outside their comfort zones. The powerful cast gets more in over its head with each passing episode, which helps maintain tension in the anime and adds to the believability of the villains' repeated escapes.\
If the viewer stops to think about the story, things start to unravel a touch. The twists and turns of the series' second half are hardly surprising, and the simple fact that the faculty leaves the fate of the world to a group of students seems implausible at best. BUT Soul Eater's plot lacks adequate breathing room for these doubts to ruin the experience. As each entry snaps seamlessly into the one that came before, even the over-the-top climax makes perfect sense when it arrives in context. However, the breakneck pacing paints the show into a bit of a corner, and the final episode comes to an end in a manner so disappointing and abrupt that it borders on impressive. In retrospect, however, the sting of the dismal finale fades--the juddering mess only comes as a terrible shock because everything that precedes it fits so tightly together.\
Art (9/10)\
Soul Eater sports a stylish look ripped right out of a Tim Burton movie. The dark background palette, unnatural angles, and stark scenery set the mood perfectly for the horror themed show. But moreso than the overal art direction, the details bring the effect home. Whether it be the creepy, anthropomorphic sun and moon, the graveyard feel of Shinigami's room, or the subtly concave perspective in Soul's mind, the animators spare no opportunity to add character to every environment. Consequently, every location feels like an organic part of the anime's world. In addition, the three primary leads maintain the series' feel by embodying the three pillars of goth style: Maka in her plaid skirt, dark greatcoat and tie; Black Star decked out in zippers and steel-toed kicks; and Kid in a plain black suit. Just like in the backgrounds, little touches like the stars on Black Star's shoes, or Kid's skull bolo-tie and rings give the characters a concrete feel that seems to say \"personal style choices\" instead of \"designed by an artist\"; these considerations extend into the villains' wardrobes as well, from Free's canine facial features to Arachne's preponderance of spider symbolism to Eruka's spotted cheeks and amphibian eyes (am I strange for finding her cute?).\
In the end, however, the quality of a shounen anime's visuals depends on its action sequences, and here Soul Eater delivers with mixed results. When the series wants to, it offers up kinetic action that feels fluid and engaging. However, the overly-dramatic angles cause more than a few issues with characters deforming and also results in more than a few instances of still-frame posing in each conflict. The little details again help the effort along, whether it be the lithe motion of Medusa's Vector Arrow or Black Star's Shadow Star, or the variable forms of Crona's Black Blood.\
Sound (8/10)\
Gusto. That describes the Soul Eater audio in one word. Each episode starts with one of the two solid opening themes, and ends with one of the fantastic endings. While in this reviewer's humble opinion, Diggy Mo's \"Bakusou Yume Uta\" stands out as the best, the fourth song, \"STRENGTH\" fits the mood of the series best--its mournful strains form the ideal compliment to the darker content at the series' end. In between the OP and EDs of each episode, the hard rock soundtrack matches the gothic visuals to a \"T\", making use of guitars to communicate emotion in places normally reserved for pianos and strings.\
Strangely enough, no one voice actor stands out above the crowd, because everyone turns in a solid performance--unusual for a shounen show. While the series' protagonists bring nothing remarkable to the table, the rouges gallery and side characters provide ample opportunities for interesting voice work. Koyasu Takehito (Excalibur), Uchida Yuuya (Franken Stein), and Koyama Rikiya (Shinigami) all bring texture and humor to the otherwise straightforward proceedings.\
Characters (8/10)\
Since a good deal of its material appears derivative, Soul Eater goes to great lengths to set apart its characters from their source material. For every \"been there, done that\" entry like Mifune (samurai bodyguard--how novel!), the writers supply a quirky member like Joe Buttataki. The construction of the cast demonstrates an acute sense of self-awareness that helps to carry the whole effort. At its best, the show sinks deeply into self-parody in pursuit of originality with the horribly OCD yet undeniably cool Death the Kid, the painfully peculiar Excalibur, and the font of fan-service, Blair.\
Too add some extra oomph to the series' less original characters, Soul Eater peppers its cast with interesting interactions and relationships which help add dimension to each person. From Black Star's friendly rivalry with Soul to the creepy sexual tension between Stein and Medusa, the show bristles with tiny moments of interplay that either brighten plot-related pauses in the action or ice the delicious combat cake with moments of development. Much like the stylistic enhancements in the visuals, these interpersonal moments help the actors in the anime feel like whole people and less like typical shounen protagonists.\
Overall (8/10)\
With a good ending, Soul Eater would have jumped from \"good\" into \"great\" territory. While the show borrows heavily from other works, its execution and verve carry it off as a memorable shounen series. Unlike its brethren that tend to cut costs and pump up the episode count to maximize revenue, this anime maintains a focused agenda for two action-packed seasons, and that helps its cause. Anime like this one raise the bar for \"average\" by demonstrating how even a derivative effort can engage and entertain. If you're interested in seeing how fun action story with a real end and sense of urgency comes together, check this one out; You won't be disappointed.\

    Soul Eater seems more like an anime to watch when you have nothing else to do. The story is pretty clique. I mean there's like 50 other anime that has shinigami and soul stuff but the producers put in some twists to make up part of it. The art had a weird style compared to most anime but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The animation was really amazing.\
From what I remember, there was barely any background info about the characters besides the basics. I know Soul is just a laid-back type of guy who supports his partner but that's about it. Same with some\
          \
        other characters.\
Overall, I'll give it a 6 cuz it was a good anime to watch just to burn time off\

    ok this is my first review so go easy on me. \
soul eater is about a world like ours with the same contenients and some basic similaritys. but mostly its completely different, it has monsters and witches and death gods. \
the main story line revloves around the students at shibusen academy. which is a school that teaches meisters and weapons how to fight. meisters are people with special abilitys that allow them to either see spirit energy or some other ability. and weapons are people who can transform into various weapons.\
the main character imo is maka the story seems to revolve around her and soul.\
          \
        not that the other characters dont get there time in the spotlight, this is a bones anime and they are known for there characters. \
the only problems with the story is that it sort of dosent really end. since the manga is still going they really should have made this show like bleach and just kept going with it, but sadly they decided against it. not that its a cliffhangers its actually a very strong ending.\
the artwork is top notch. this is one of the few animes ive seen where styles are mixed. between maka, black star, and death kid there are 3 different art styles that match the characters. i was just blown away from the fights as well so many of them are very engaging and beautiful. \
the sound was also top notch i loved all the music especially the opening and closing music.\
i loved all of the characters. like i said imo its all about maka but that dosent mean that the other characters are weak. my personal fav was EXCALIBUR!!\
i enjoyed this anime so much i really cant say enough good about. its just so well made. its one of those few gems among anime thats just amazing and sets the bar higher.\
over all this is now the second best anime ive ever seen not that it couldnt be first its just i really loved gilgamesh. so if your looking for a really good show then look no further.\

    Soul Eater is a show that is very average in all areas. It doesn't go above and beyond in anyway, and it happens to fall within your stereotypical anime standards. Instead of going over each catagory, I think i'll just skip it and review the worst aspect of this anime.\
The Characters\
I found the characters to be the biggest problem with this show. They are all horribly annoying. \
Death the Kid - An OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) kid who is willing to put the mission and others at risk in order to satisfy his desire to make everything symmetrical. Really pisses me off!!!!!\
Black Star - An\
          \
        exact clone of Naruto. The only difference is that Naruto wants to get stronger in order to protect those important to him, while Black Star wants to get stronger for himself. And on occassion he is prone to throw tantrums (what I interpret to be tantrums. Gets all moody like he has PMS) when he looses.\
Maka - Okay personality, except she gets moody sometimes also. I didn't like the voice actor either. She had a very monotone voice. When she is yelling in anger, if I did not have the picture to go with the voice, I would not be able to tell what kind of emotion her voice is trying to convey.\
Excalibur - Worst character ever created. Every episode that has him is a pointless filler episode. He was so annoying that I just skipped all the episodes that contained him (which were only a few THANK GOD!). He constantly interrupts others and says irrelevant things. You have to see him to get the full meaning of what I'm trying to describe.\
Shinigami - What can I say... Looks like a retard and talks like a retard.\
Oh and just a heads up, the way they defeat the final boss does not make sense. I'm assuming the writers made the bad guy so strong that they couldn't figure out a way to kill him, so they just made something dumb happen.\
The one positive thing that I will mention in this review is that the powers and abilities in this show are pretty unique. Unlike the tv show Heroes where they just copied all of the powers from X-men, the writer was actually original in some of the characters abilities. The witch medusa has a cool Vector Arrow thing going on and another guy uses the blades of chain saws.\
Overall, not a great anime. I can't believe I managed to finish it, but if you are still planning on watching it, you will see that I AM RIGHT. YOU WILL THEN BOW TO MY GREATNESS AND CALL ME GOD!\

    The premise to Soul Eater is kind of like if you took the “organization of soul reapers” concept of Bleach, put it together with the “organization of child soldiers” concept of Naruto, meshed that together, and than added a hint of FLCL.\
All around its pretty much your typical shounen fighting anime, but stands from the rest of the herd thanks to its colorful and imaginative setting. The show deploys quite a lot of the tropes commonly-used in modern shounen series, but manages to be well-written enough that this use of tropes does not come off as cliché, and instead creates a fairly enjoyable experience.\
The vast\
          \
        majority of the characters come off as at least a little cliché, but again the series is well-written enough that its not really a problem; each character has enough quirkiness and originality that they end up actually being likable instead of annoying.\
(As a side note, quite a few characters seem fairly similar to those from Naruto. Seeing how Soul Eater began serialization about seven years after Naruto, I wouldn't be surprised if this were true.)\
The best part of Soul Eater would definitely be the artwork and fight scenes. The characters and background art is all consistently well drawn. The setting and background art has is rather surreal and dream-like. The series jumps around a lot from being colorful and upbeat to dark and gloomy, but does well in choosing when to be either of those two contrasts. The majority of the time the fight scenes are fast and highly stylish, and the artwork does well in complimenting this.\
The problem with Soul Eater is with its Gecko Ending. I've never actually read the original manga, but I've been told that somewhere around episode 35 is when the anime diverges from the source material and starts to do its own thing. This is when the story goes downhill, and begins to dive into the depths of mediocrity.\
For the first two thirds of the series,  the actual story and plot isn't too remarkable, but is decent enough and succeeds in providing us some good ol' fantasy violence. During remaining 15 episodes however, a shift in tone occurs and all of the sudden the story is trying too hard be more dramatic, and ends up taking itself too seriously in the process. The characters also ended being somewhat less likable, and the everything leading up to the conclusion felt a tad bit rushed. Mind you, it's not exactly bad, just mediocre. The final three episodes in particular is when the story starts to go bad, resulting in a very unsatisfying conclusion to what was otherwise an alright series.\
If your a fan of Naruto, Bleach, or similar shounen series, you'll definitely like Soul Eater, as it has all things you would come to expect from the genre (both good and bad.) However, because of the poorly executed Gecko Ending, it would probably be a better idea to try your luck with the original manga instead.\

    If Tim Burton were to make an anime, the product would be Soul Eater. Watching the anime is reminiscent of the Saturday morning cartoons vibe. With an abundance of creepy Halloween themed matter scattered throughout the entire series and a healthy serving of dark humor, Soul Eater is an oddly addicting show. There is also an eclectic swath of music thrown into the show, some of which I found stuck in my head when I wasn't watching. And don't let the seemingly basic animation fool you. When it comes down to the fight scenes and overall scenery and character designs, studio BONES delivers as always.\
          \
        The \"cartoony\" style of the anime is deliberate and most enjoyable to behold if embraced. Although the story-line itself leaves a bit to be desired, it instead serves as a launch pad for artist creativity and allows the characters to carry the show.\

    Fairly generic shonen anime along the lines of more popular ones like _Naruto_.\
(In fact, the similarities between SE and _Naruto_ - whose manga started several years before SE's manga and was a big success by that point - are glaring enough as to straddle the line between legitimate borrowing and plagiarism, from the visual design of the iconic ninja vests & headband to the eccentric powerful but dark white-haired mentor to the immensely powerful ancient city leader being trapped in a magical field while an epic battle rages.)\
SE's best aspects are its visual style. Some scenes and designs are memorable: the moon, whether it's grinning\
          \
        or dripping blood, is regularly disturbing in a Tim Burton-esque fashion, the little demon in Soul is an interesting take on the Devil and suits (and the hand-biting an excellently disturbing mannerism), and the revival of the Kishin is fantastic, whether it's the extremely creepy hallucinations afflicting characters before the revival or the animation of the body reconstructing himself and learning how to move again, or Medusa's 'vector' weapons. Character designs are also sufficiently memorable that one is unlikely to confuse anyone, and are colorful enough that one rarely gets bored of watching the main characters (although I wish Maka Albarn's face & eyes were less of a cipher, Kid Death makes up for it with his wardrobe and peculiar martial arts). I must of course mention Excalibur, who is both visually striking (what is he, anyway? an anteater?) but also quite funny.\
The OPs and EDs are likewise excellent pairings of visuals and music.\
The characters are decent (once their shticks stop being run into the ground), but the plot is even weaker. Reviewing the overall plot, it feels like the SE anime almost made a point of failing to explore intriguing possibilities and leaving Chekhov guns unfired.\
The first time we see the Kishin's face, it is a shock as he is instantly recognizable as looking like Kid Death, down to the white hair highlights; one assumes that Asura is actually Death's son and Kid's brother, and this will be extremely important - but nothing is ever made of this and Asura is implied to be human.\
The series drove me nuts by name-dropping Maka's mother constantly, but never once showing a photo of her or her on screen or giving any information whatsoever about her - surely once we finally learn in episode 39 or 40 that she's still alive and traveling the world and has a unique powerful magical ability, she will turn out to be critical to the war against the Kishin and has been engaged in extremely important work for the DWMA and will be a major character? Nope; all we learn is that she's fat.\
The danger of the Kishin's madness infecting the world is emphasized again and again, and the danger shown in one of the most memorable scenes during the escape of the Kishin; surely once he escapes, the series tempo will speed up dramatically as the world begins to fall apart, everyone from Death on down begins to go insane, and tough choices will be made, showing that SE can pull off the classic escalation formula of starting as comedy and turning into dark action-drama that made other series like _Fullmetal Alchemist_ so memorable? Nope. Stein is literally the only character to go mad, and the series tempo slows down, if anything, and the striking visions are totally abandoned even in the final battle face to face with the Kishin inside his bubble.\
Speaking of Stein, since he's the only one who goes mad and this is a major plot point over dozens of episodes and a core part of Medusa's schemes, surely the consequences of his insanity will be equally major and core to her plan? Nope and nope.\
Well, what about the hints that Death is not such a pure and noble defender of order and has a sinister background scheme going on which may betray the efforts of the protagonists and justify the criticisms of the 'evil' characters, in a subversion that leads to meaningful conflict and weighing difficult moral choices? Hah, nope! Nope, Death really is a great guy, you were just being paranoid.\
How about all the witches who would awaken, under the leadership of the 'Old Witch'? Nope nope.\
Or what about Black Star, the most mentally unstable and dangerous of the 3 protagonists, who you keep expecting to go off the reservation? Nope.\
How about Excalibur, who gets an entire episode demonstrating how he is the most powerful weapon in the world and is a Chekhov's gun among Chekhov guns - I will eat my hat if he doesn't even fight by the end! Nope. It's a good thing I didn't make any bets about that one since hats take a long time to cut up and eat.\
So weirdly, while it certainly feels that SE could fill up 51 episodes without any problem, it winds up being surprisingly empty and full of MacGuffins and unimportant one-shot episodes.\
(Reading the WP summary, the finished manga plot is quite different. I wonder how many of these problems stem from the adaptation challenge where the anime studio tries to avoid making changes or anticipating the manga.)\
SE's aversion to ever killing off a character, no matter how minor or merited, removes any sense of weight or impact from plot twists. It doesn't matter if Soul sacrifices himself - you know he'll be fine no matter what. Or Medusa. I simply sighed when I saw the epilogue implying she had survived. *Again*. I thought Medusa surviving once was a bad decision as it took the accomplishment away from Stein and meant his 'fall' was less a lingering legacy of Medusa than some more of her scheming and so less due to Stein himself (a fall because of internal character conflicts is far more interesting and tragic than a fall due to the machinations of a tempter), but surviving twice is just in bad taste. How can any victory ever feel satisfying or any defeat tragic when the series refuses to let there be real consequences?\
Often plot twists or endings come off as feeling deeply cheap and unearned and by authorial fiat. The Black Star / Tsubaki episodes tend to be particularly flawed: when Tsubaki defeats her brother, how exactly did she resolve her brother's problems? You can't tell me because the episode jumps straight from his festering resentment of her to her killing him somehow. Or consider Black Star's final duel with Mifune: Mifune quite reasonably thinks Black Star is a mad dog who needs to be put down before he becomes a demon like his father, and Black Star declares that this will not be a problem... because he'll simply be better than that, somehow, and cuts down Mifune. To say that this is an inadequate resolution of the problem is to dignify the episode by implying it had any resolution, and a particular pity because Black Star had the most genuine character growth over the series\
What the 'meaning' of the whole series is supposed to be aside from the usual shonen tropes is unclear. Asura is clearly intended to be some form of Buddhism, as his name references the class of both benevolent & malevolent warring gods a level up from humans that Buddhism adopts from Hinduism, his weapon is a vajra (the double-ended dagger symbolically associated with Buddhas and enlightenment), vajras symbolize an entire branch of Buddhism (Vajrayana, as opposed to Hinayana or Mahayana), I think the triple-eye motif may be drawn from somewhere in Buddhism as well, Asura's appearance of rags closely resembles a mendicant priest, his third eye opening is another Hindu/Buddhist trope, he makes mystical mudra gestures (also associated with esoteric Buddhism), and his talk about killing his imagination to avoid fear could be very vaguely considered akin to Buddhism's goal of eliminating craving and hence suffering; but what does it all amount to?\
And what was the role of the black blood? I thought it was supposed to reflect the Kishin's madness in some way but it never winds up being given any particular importance (quite aside from the cheap and easy way that the black blood madness infection keeps being resolved).\
Overall, was this worth 51 episodes? No, not really. (Feel free to watch on 2x.)\

    Soul Eater takes place in Death City, home to the Death Weapon Meister Academy (DWMA) , an academy headed by Lord Death, who is a manifestation of death itself. Its mission: to raise \"Death Scythes\" for the Shinigami to wield against the many evils of their world. These Death Scythes, however, are not made from physical weapons; rather, they are born from human hybrids who have the ability to transform their bodies into Demon Weapons, and only after they have consumed the souls of 99 evil beings and one witch's soul.\
Soul Eater follows seven students of the DWMA as they take on missions to collect\
          \
        souls and protect the city from the world's threats while working together under the snickering sun to become sounder in mind, body, and soul.\
The main characters of this anime are Maka ,and her partner Soul who transforms into a scythe, Blackstar, and his partner Tsubaki who transforms into various ninja based weapons, and the son of lord death Death the kid with his partners Liz and Patty who transform into pistols. The most prominent supporting characters in the show are the teachers at the academy, and the antagonists.\
The story of Soul Ester follows the basic Shōnen anime formula of a great evil that returns and wants world domination, and our main characters go through a series of events to get them through certain points to develop themselves, and the story. The story while formulaic was mostly well executed, the situations the characters were in were appropriate, and developed their characters perfectly. I also, have praise soul eater for storyline progression as the events of one episode were carried forward to the next episode instead of being forgotten, and treated like filler, so massive respect to that. However some of the episodes were completely forgettable, and served no purpose at all.\
Bones studio did a commendable job with the animation of the show. The action sequences were fluid, and moved at a pace that always kept me on the edge of my seat and didn't look away. Some of the top battles in my opinion were the final showdown, Death vs Asura, Black Star vs Mifune, Stein vs Medusa, Kid and Blackstar vs Free, and Maka vs Crona. The location and character design was really good as well especially Death city had this vibe about it that really distinguishes it from other anime. Regarding character design all have a unique look to them with the best looking ones being Death,Asura and Stein.\
Soul Eater has one of the best opening I've ever heard in my life which is their first opening resonance by T.M revolution, this opening was beast on every conceivable level, and got me hyped for what was to com. The second opening Papermoon was less exciting but still a pretty cool opening. Out of the four ending themes that Soul Eater the second, and fourth stand out especially the fourth one as it was visual storytelling at its finest, and did a better job of building up Asura than most of the anime.\
The biggest strength Soul Eater has is its characters. Each is unique in their own way with their own personalities, and is flushed out to a certain degree, even some of side characters were intriguing. I have to commend Soul Eater for dedicating the first three episodes to the main characters. This was great as it gave the audience a taste of what each character had to offer. Maka was a pretty sweet main protagonist, she had a relatable backstory, and had a vibe that just made you want to root for her. Her partner Soul was pretty much the compassionate cool kid stereotype but done correctly, furthermore he had a really cool sub plot going on with his literal inner demon. Blackstar was pretty much like Naruto annoying at the start but you end up rooting for him in the end, and his partner Tsubaki was pretty much his polar opposite creating an interesting dynamic. My favourite character in the show without a doubt was Death the kid, because he was the funniest, and the most badass character in the entire anime. When kid was on screen I watched, when he spoke I listened, and he had the best dynamic as he'd had two partners in Liz and Patty and the interactions these three had were some of the best parts of the show. \
There were a few great supporting characters as well, Death was pretty great, Professor Franken Stein was also phenomenal, and he had one of the best stories in the entire anime. The main antagonist Asura was also really interesting when he was first introduced. Medusa was also, a fantastic villain for the first half of the show. the character of Crona was also really interesting to watch. \
However my main issue with Soul Eater was the execution of certain elements.The biggest one being Asura the \"main\" antagonist. I used quotations  on main because he is not treated like the main villain in the anime. the fourth ending theme did a better job of building him up than the anime did. The episode in which he returned and his backstory was brilliant but they didn't follow through with anything until the end. The story with Crona could have been interesting, but the execution was predictable and horrendous. The segments with him, Marie and Medusa was absolutely get off my tv worthy. They also introduce a character called Free who at first seemed to be a prime secondary antagonist, and he was then pushed to the side. Furthermore the relationship between Maka and her father Spirt is never fully developed by the show. Also some of the episodes did feel like filler , and some situations were boring beyond belief.\
That aside I really enjoyed Soul Eater, I thought that it was a fun show with great action sequences and a cool group of characters to be around. if there was a sequel or follow up or even a prequel I would definitely be interested in seeing it.",

The characters were really cool and unique from Death The kid the son of a god (Death/Shinigami) to Black Star a guy with a huge ego who thinks of himself as stronger then god the only thing wrong with the character development is that in the anime that completely removed all of Kim's (who is also my favorite Soul Eater Character) character development when they adapted it into the anime and that includes the content from chapters before they skipped volumes\

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\
Overall - 6:\
soul eater is not as good as I had originally thought back when I first watched it. To me it felt like it was on par with gurren lagann or FMA (the original, not brotherhood) but when I re-re-watched it recently a lot of the little things bugged me more than they had before. If I look at the series critically I can start to see all kinds of problems that I wasn't as in tune to when I had originally watched or even re-watched it.\
The average of everything else gives it a 6, but honestly that just doesn't seem\
          \
        right to me, and that's probably because despite all its flaws it's still a well made anime.\
Story - 3:\
The story is alright but the reason the section is so low is because of the bad world building. Soul eater is one of those animes that deviates so much from real life anytime anything happens there always seems to be a character explaining some part of it so the audience knows what's going on. I still don't really know how weapons work, and I don't think the creator does as well, at least that's how inconsistent it felt.\
It also suffers heavily from putting too much focus on the main characters, and kinda going off that the power balance of what they say versus what is the case is so far off base it makes you question if anyone knows what is going on. For example: meisters are broken into categories based on the number of stars they have. All the main characters are 1 star meisters (the lowest rank) the problem is that most of the cannon faughter are two star meisters which doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The example I'm thinking about is on the lost island where sid lead a group of two star meisters to fight against arachnophobia and it showed each meister going toe to toe with a member of arachnophobia. Then it cuts to the secondary characters (all 1 star meisters) taking on hoards of the arachnophobia members by themselves. Another example of this is how in the first couple of episodes when they talk about kid they make sure we know that he is a reaper and that he is more powerful than most other students at the academy. But because he's not the main main character he can't possibly be more powerful than maka so they fight on pretty much even terms for the rest of the anime.\
The anime also doesn't want to kill off a single character, the only time I can recall an important character actually dying is within the very end of the anime where it doesn't matter that much, and even then most of the characters that looked like they were going to die all survived. Medusa, Death, Crona, All the main characters, all of medusa and arachne's underlings (that were named), all survived when a lot of those were on the brink of death.\
The end was also pretty horrendous I could go more in depth but overall it was just the fact that random twists that held little consequence were thrown one after the other.\
The pacing was a bit tough at times as well, it felt like the show could have been a lot shorter, especially if they cut out most of the blatant filler episodes, or at the very least shortened and combined them. There really wasn't a need for a second excalibur focused episode, let alone a third.\
The only good thing about the plot is that it is a decent vessel for some of the other things the show has to offer (some humor and cool fights).\
Art - 8:\
The art is solid, and is has some cool flair like how the explosions from kid's cannon's have skulls or the way they show the shine of the weapons revealing the people they are. The show is a bit old so it's not top notch, but it holds up.\
Sound - 4:\
The OST is nothing too special, it does have a couple of memorable songs but overall it's not too great. It's also erie how similar it sounds to gurren lagann's OST. My biggest complaint with sound came from when I watched it recently. The mixing was pretty bad so I had to manually adjust the sound throughout an episode to make sure it didn't get too loud.\
The openings and endings are nothing too special (except ending 3, I really liked that one)\
Character - 7:\
The characters were frustrating and believable. Whether that be Black Star's struggle coping with his losses or maka's frustration when not being able to pull off a technique. There were times the characters got a bit tiresome, but it is one of the show's major draws, at least for me.\
One of the characters I have the biggest problem with is Ashura, mostly because he felt like no fewer than 4 separate characters based on what point in the anime it was. And I mean this not only in his personality, but his design as well.\
Enjoyment - 8:\
As I've said before when I watch this the first two times, I really liked it, but I didn't quite as much this most recent time.\

    Soul Eater is an amazing anime, and one of the funniest. It is my favorite anime (don't judge) by far. \
Story- 9: The story is amazing. Meisters who have friends who turn into weapons. Anything cooler? The only thing I don't like is they didn't follow the manga towards the end on the second season, and butchered the very end fight. \
Art- 9: Art is really good, but I'm not one to ask for that, I don't really care.\

Characters- 8: I really love\

        most of the characters, and I really like the connection they have towards each other, although,I really felt they should of gone into a little more detail on how they met.

Enjoyment- 10 : I enjoyed every second of it. I LOVE Soul Eater. \

    Soul Eater to me cones off as a show with a lot of potential but fails to do anything memorable with it.\
Story: 5\
For the most part i feel indifferent to Soul Eaters story with its continual setups and failed executions it ends up as being another point where the show falls off. The story is split into two halves with the first half in my opinion being the better of the two. The first half of the show takes a less serious more playful tone, I'm glad to say that the humor of this show is one thing it does right. I found it to\
          \
        be one of thefew shows I've seen in recent memory to really make me laugh. The first halfs episodic style also serves to develop the cast. The second, Looney half of this show is disastrous suffering from extreme tonal inconsistencies leaving the show feel like nothing is at stake. The story is rushed, convoluted and makes no sense and the end of this show is just so unsatisfying, it really pulls this show down.\
Art: 9\
This shows art is absolutely amazing, the character designs are striking distinct work and forthe most part there isn't a character who's design in this show i dislike. The aesthetics overall are very interesting and unique. Studio bones one again does an outstanding job with the animation it feels fluid and alive with every fight scene leaning new on the edge of my bed.\
Sound: N/A\
The sound in this show unfortunately want something i really pushed attention to so can't give much of an opinion on it but on voice acting i personally preferred the dub of this show finding the subbed version to be annoying and finding somr chatacters such as black star to be intolerable.\

Despite the show having seven different main characters they all for the most part have something likable about them, with black star and tsubaki being the most stand out for me. Black Star's confidence in himslef though at the start can seem obnoxious becomes a funny and endearing character trait. Tsubaki on the other hand stays dull and boring and serves to drag out their character arcs. These seven characters despite being likeable are hit or miss for the most part. Tge chargers having their own unique traits means that you'll most likely find at least one person you like but with so many of them there is never really a chance to fully develop them or time to grow fully attached to a specific character.\
Enjoyment: 7\
Despite its many flaws, soul eater is still relatively enjoyable. The chemistry between the characters and the humor still make this show a somewhat good watch, and a fun show to watch around Halloween time.\
Overall 7/10\

    Soul Eater has became one of my favorite Anime's. Love most of the characters, Love the art style to death and love the comedy. \
~~ SPOILERS~~\
The real problem starts as soon as the Second episode. With at least top 3 worst characters in the entire show. His name is Black Star. \
~~Miesters~~\
Blackstar : My god this is an awful character. His entire character can be summed up with two goals. Beat a god and be an annoying little asshole as much as possible. When i first saw him in the previews for episode 2 what watching the first episode i already disliked him. \
He goes\
          \
        through out the series always being so full of himself and always thinking he can do anything because HE\"S BLACKSTAR THAT\"S WHY!! ( No joke he said's this once or twice in the show) he is also for some reason the most powerful of the 3 character Maka, Death the kid and himself. For a while he wasn't so bad he kind of got pushed to the side. Then near the second half of the show i'd say he comes back in force being annoying as can be. His poor weapon \"Tsubaki\" I feel bad for her cause she is always by him and sometimes i dislike her cause she feeds his narcissism. Will leave ti hear tell the end of the review .\
Maka : Was one of my favorites for the first 30 or so episodes. Then she starts doing dumb things. Getting mad at small stuff and being so protective over someone that used to be a villain. Not gonna go into a rant like i did with \"BlackStar\" But just to wrap this up. She started turning into a whinny little kid near the end. i still like her just not as much.\
Death The Kid: Was my second favorite character than became my most favorite. He is the son of Death and is badass and the relationship he has with his weapons are the best. He's also obsessed with symmetry for what ever reason.\
~~ Weapons~~\
Soul Eater: Sense his name is the title of the show you would think that he would be the Main Character out of all the Main Characters. But no. I would say he is actually least focused on character of them all. Every character gets a backstory Miesters and Weapons included. Yet all we get is that he met his Maka ( His Miester) at the entrance exam or something. He tends to not show up for a couple episodes at a time or tends to not even have more than a couple of words. He has one story happening with him and it involves him struggling for a control of power and if he loses he succumbs to madness. One of the most biggest let downs in characters in the entire story.\
Thompson sisters : They are \" Death the Kid\" weapons he uses. They are two sisters \"Liz\" and \"Patty\". Don't know much to say about them except that they are my favorite duo of all the characters. The relationship with Death is great and funny and i enjoy the time they're on the screen.\
Tsubaki : Is  a nice character with the in all honesty the biggest back story of all the MC's. She is nice and caring and is the only one that can deal with BlackStar's narcissism. \
\
~~ Villains ~~ \
Not gonna be doing all of them just ones i find worth mentioning\
Medusa: Personal favorite villain of them all. She is funny at times, Awesome character design and is brutal. She doesn't care at all about her own son. ( They never even mention who her sons father is) She is also really hard to kill. Stein and Medusa are two people i ship together. Even if they are both enemies to each other. Glad they didn't keep her dead in the end.\
Arachne : Someone who i would like to have seen more of. I also wish she wasn't just common mustache twirling villain. We see in a flashback once that she looked scared. I was hoping for something more sympathetic. Also the way they just kill her off is really dumb.\
\
~~Biggest issues~~\
So besides the character flaws. Something else to mention is the constant use of cliche and predictable stuff that is gonna happen. Such as the way Arachne died or that no one was gonna die in these big fights.\
That's another issue. This show at first was good in this regard. But then the show started doing bait and switches on us ever 3-10 episodes. Character would be seen being hurt in a way that would result in death. But for what ever reason they somehow come back alive. At the ending was happening i felt no tension cause i had already figured out this flaw awhile ago. There are some characters i would have loved to die even just for a dramatic scene ( Looks at BlackStar) Bringing up the ending leads to the biggest issue of them all sadly.\
The ending destroying tons of tension built up over the entire show's history. This big battle that's meant to happen is finally happening. Death Itself is going to fight off against a former comrade of Death. Then Death gets almost killed of with a little battle happening between them with the Villain being the stereotypical thing of sprouting all this philosophy. \
This out come was so predictable. Just to pick a reason out of the top of my head is that Death said's you already lost when you did X. Like i feel this is such a cliche. Especially in Japanese media where someone saids something along those lines and it's almost certain that they will lose. \
That's something else annoying.  Beating Death It's self i feel should be something only someone akin to god or the devil should have a chance at. He is the mother f*cking Grim Reaper. The one thing everyone has in common is the ability to Die and this Dude is in control of that shit. He should not almost die from a Laser beam hit with stock laser beam audio. Oh god that annoyed me. But this isn't the worst. Oh i wish it was.\
So this dude that beat and again DEATH ITSELF. His name is Asura. Want to know how he is defeated ? Well do you ? Cause its not like he would be defeated by a fist right ? Right ? .... So yes Maka is the last one able to fight him. After being on the verge of Death. For some reason Asura freaks out and after some dumb nonsense about how \" You don't need a weapon. Because I have bravery\"  She goes and punches him once and he is dead. Just like that. Then we are treated to something you would find in a ending of a video game. Death the Kid starts saying how there is still stuff to do and the fight isn't over. This is what i find in crappy tripple A games that don't know how to say you can still go and do side missions.\
But yes for some reason Asura never fully goes and kills Death even with nothing stopping him. He never kills any other people. In fact he for a while is having trouble with BlackStar and Death the Kid. This dude who just beat Death is having trouble with these kids.\
I'm leaving that ending there cause it honestly is such a let down and is so annoying . \
But i do want to mention before i leave that i like that Vajra ( Asura's weapon that he ate) Was spit back up before he died so i'm assuming that Vajra is alive. That's nice that's something i was wanting.\

~~ SPOILERS OVER~~ \

    So it's time for me to start talking about Soul Eater.\
First things first, this anime is about people that turn into weapons and the people who use them to fight. This anime has a lot of well executed fight scenes that make for an enjoyable watch while at the same time keeps a nice Halloween like theme to it that adds to the semi-creepy setting. I say semi creepy because there are moment that are purely comical.\
The setting is really nice and adds the darker elements to the show. The show's fight scenes also add to the setting with most of them taking place either\
          \
        at night or in dark areas. The weapon designs for the show also add elements to the show that really completes the Halloween like setting.\
The characters are an interesting bunch. They vary from the smart and confident to the relaxed and cocky. Each character has certain traits to them that distinguishes them from the other characters in the providing moments where they either truly shine or just completely displayed with comical reactions.\
So basically, this is Halloween the anime. It's filled with monsters, killers, witches, and even zombies. While it isn't the most creepiest anime, it still has a Halloween theme to it much like the a Tim Burton film, but that's just my opinion. I highly recommend it as it was a really good watch.\

                          \
    This show is a real test of the \"Rule of Cool.\" It expertly fosters a \"cool, but not trying too hard\" aesthetic through the use of incredibly smooth animation, a high energy soundtrack, great fight choreography, and humor that makes you aware it doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's the main selling point of the show, it's just fun to watch even if there's nothing overly compelling going on at a thematic level. That aesthetic can be broken at times though when you realize how loose the story is with its rules and if the jokes stop landing.\
Before I delve into specifics though, I\
          \
        want to highlight the animation again. If you're not sure what to think about this show, google the first OP and just watch it. If you think it looks cool, give it a try. I was personally on the fence whether the show was worth investing 19 hours into after 3 episodes, but I really liked the animation, which of course led me to learn this was a Studio Bones product, the studio that made some of my favorite Shonen adaptations such as Full Metal Alchemist (and FMA:Brotherhood), Boku no Hero Academia, Mob Psycho 100, and Eureka Seven (not technically Shonen, but relevant). This show has something in common with each of those, and if you like them, you'll probably like this one, the production values are just stellar.\
That said, there were some things holding this show back from being great for me. The characters work really well together, especially for comedic purposes, but at times the show would spend entire episodes focusing on individual supporting characters that don't have much to them yet besides their gimmick. To be more specific, Black Star is an unbearably arrogant child, Death the Kid needs to be put on medication for his symmetry OCD, and spending 3 whole episodes with Excalibur was 2 1/2 too many. By the end, each of these characters was at least tolerable (I even liked Death the Kid by the end), but that doesn't change the fact that maybe a third of the episodes in this show are just not good if you don't like the joke that they're based on.\
Which is a real shame, because that time could've been used to flesh out the world or focus on some of the more interesting characters. The show's titular character Soul has a literal inner demon, how often do you get to be that on the nose? That was still a good story arc, but it definitely deserved a greater percentage of the screen time than it got. \
In addition to the hit or miss jokes, you really have to just go along with the plot. Stuff happens, they never really explain any of it in depth, and you just have to be okay with that.\
This brings me back to that \"Rule of Cool.\" How much you like this show is completely determined by how much the \"cool\" cancels out the things you don't like. For me, it did for the most part, but not completely, so it gets a 7, but again, I highly recommend checking out the animation and maybe watching a few episodes for yourself.\

    This is a truly excellent show. I consider this to be the anime that got me into anime. After watching this I really began watching anime on a daily basis, before it I just wasn't really that interested. \
Story (10/10)\
I personally found the story to be absolutely excellent. For about the first half, the anime feels like it is going to be a typical adventure anime following the two main characters on their trial. However, other events occur in the background surrounding a much more ominous enemy. This all begins to wind together, involving the students, and before I knew it there was this insane\
          \
        plot device. It all leads up to a really awesome ending that is climactic and satisfying. \
Art(8/10)\
The art is quirky and strange. It is all set to this halloweeny feel with the characters, theme, and environment. The animation is smooth, and the battles are really bad ass.\
Sound(8/10)\
From the amazing intros down the the sounds of the scythe, the audio is really good. The sound effects are spot on and the voice acting is really well done.\
Character(8/10)\
As expected from a shounen, there is really good character development for all of the characters as they grow to become more mature and overcome their struggles. I also just really enjoyed the cast. Aside from Black Star, I liked all of the characters, and I was always hoping for the best for them. \
Enjoyment(8/10)\
With a good blend of comedy, intense action, and deep story, I found this anime to be really fun to watch. I never felt overwhelmed, but at the same time the anime never lost its focus on the story. There was also very limited filler, which is always nice to see.\
In the end, I am giving Soul Eater a 9/10 because it is great. The show is entertaining, well directed, and well written. I recommend this to anyone looking for something a little unique with an interesting story and characters. However, if you are looking for something that will change your soul, this isn't for you, this is still just a typical shounen. \

Story\
7/10\
The story is about weapons and meisters that fight together using the power of their souls. And of course there is new enemies that come around that need to be stopped against. I can't go too much in depth with the story without giving away spoilers. Overall the story is great. It's entertaining to watch, and you always wonder what will happen next. There are a couple flaws that keep it from getting a 10 though. One, it has a couple of plot holes. Can't tell you what they are without spoiling.\
          \
        But they do bother me a bit. Two, the biggest flaw, is the ending. Let's just say it's one of the worst things I've seen in an anime ever. It really is that bad, and has a huge impact on the scoring.\
Characters\
9.5/10\
The characters are likable, interesting, and are 3 dimensional. They have great character development and the story really does a good job setting time aside for us to get to know the characters better. The villains are great fun as well. They are intimidating and menacing with good development of their own. My only flaw is that there are so many characters that not all of them get development. But still likable.\
Animation\
10/10\
This is the best part of Soul Eater. The character designs are distinctive and original. The fight scenes are fluid, epic, and great fun to watch. As for the backgrounds, it's very creative with the dark theme that has a great Halloween vibe to it that fits in with the series very well. I like how they animated the sun and moon with different emotions. I can't think of any flaws with the animation so it gets a 10 out of 10 from me.\
Sound\
9.5/10\
The soundtrack is really good. Both opening songs are catchy, fun, and fits the mood of the show. Very memorable and fun to listen to. The musical score is very good as well, even though not as memorable as the opening songs. The English voice acting is very good with the characters voices suiting them very well. Funny as well as emotional in all the right places. Good job!\
Overall\
9/10\
A-\
A great anime even though the ending sucks. 50 out of 51 episodes that are enjoyable to watch isn't bad at all.\

    After hearing positive words about this anime from my friends, I decided to give it a try and I expected to see an original or creative shonen series. At the very last, I expected something \"special\". To be honest – I was disappointed. I DID give the anime a 8/10, but I still believe I just wasted my time watching it. The best and shortest way to describe this series is \"just another nice shonen\". No more and no less.\
\
If you considering watching this anime right now, then:\
If you are a big shonen fan, then you should try it. I doubt it'll become one of\
          \
        your favorites, but at least you should enjoy it\
If you are not a fan of shonen, but you don't mind watching a good shonen, then you shouldn't bother trying it. At the very last, watch it only if you don't have anything else to watch, because you most likely won't enjoy this one much.  \
\
Another notable thing about this series, is the fact that the second part of it is fillers. I don't mean the type of fillers in which there is no continuation of the plot. Those episodes simply don't follow the manga, and thus the anime also has a different ending. If you decided to watch the anime, then you should stop around episode 35 and think for a second. If you feel like you really like the series and it's one of your favorites, then you should stop watching the anime and start reading the manga. If you feel that it's a \"nice\" series, but that you don't really mind seeing a \"fake\" ending as long as it's pretty much on the same level as the rest of the series – finish watching the anime.\
\
Now, the review…\
\
Story: At first, I pretty enjoyed the plot and I thought that it's not your regular \"heroes vs. evil organization\" thing. Even though it was pretty similar to this pattern, which appears in almost every shonen series, I still found it \"different\" and \"refreshing\". But that didn't last too long. Sadly, after a while, the plot went on the same road as other shonen anime and turned into your classic shonen story. That's probably where I already realized that this anime won't answer my expectations.\
The only thing that stayed true during the whole series, is the fact that the plot isn't dragged around like most shonen. When an enemy appears, you go and kick his ass. You don't wait around and do nothing until you meet him by chance. Every time when I thought that \"it'll take another 20 episodes until they fight this enemy\", I was surprised again and again by the fact that it actually took less than 5 episodes. This, and this alone, made me respect the plot in this series more than in some other ones. But even so, I think the plot itself was pretty weak like in most average shonen. \
The thing that most amazed me in this series, is how professionally it can ruin its best parts. There are always some parts in a series which are average, during which you aren't necessary bored but neither you enjoying much, and there are parts which are great, interesting and enjoyable. For me, most of the anime was the \"average\" type. I wasn't bored and I had a few laughs now and then, but I wasn't hooked into it and I didn't feel that \"I like this series\". Like any normal series, this one also has its \"great parts\" during which I even considered giving it a score of 9/10. But the problem is, that they were too short. Every time I got to one of these \"great parts\", the second I finally started really enjoying these parts – they ended. Just like that. This anime starts something interesting, but finishes it at a blink of an eye. The moment I realize I'm starting to enjoy, the enjoyment fades away again. In the end, it just made series even worse. \
\
Characters:  It has a pretty classic shonen cast. A boy with a great talent who screams the whole day – check. A girl who hits her friends when she's angry – check. A teacher who sometimes acts cool and sometimes acts like an idiot – check. There were only two characters that I think are rather original. The first one is Death The Kid. While still being the classic \"a cool character who sometimes acts like an idiot\" type, I liked his huge addiction to symmetry. I think every human has something like that – something you like for no actual reason. It's like people who like even numbers more than odd numbers. \
The second character is Excalibur. While it's a little sad that they turned the legendary sword I like into a character which other characters in the series see as \"annoying\", I found the character pretty amusing. The idea itself is pretty funny, as Excalibur supposed to be a legendary holy sword of heroes which is hard to pull from the ground. In this case, it really is a powerful weapon, but it's hard to use not because it's hard to pull, but because it turns into an annoying creature who talks non stop and doesn't listen to anybody. I found this character pretty original, amusing, funny and his phrase \"Bakame!\" is one of the most memorable things about this anime for me.\
Excalibur isn't the only parody name in this series. You'll see many parodies about real life or legends in this anime. For example: a student called Ox Ford, a witch called Medusa, a sword named Ragnaroka and more.\
\
Art: The animation itself is great. The characters move swiftly and it's nice to watch how they fight. But the art style itself, is just… not my cup of tea. At first glance it looks like the art style is simply low quality and lame. But when you watch the series, you'll see how the whole series actually has quite a different art style than other anime. For the most part, I don't have problem with the art style. But as I said, it's not a style I like much, and what I really hated is how the noses of the characters are drawn. It looked just… strange…\
\
Enjoyment: A really average enjoyment. While I can't say there were many parts during which I was really bored, there also weren't many parts during which I really enjoyed. There were a few nice jokes now and then, but most of the time it was just average. Even the battles weren't as enjoyable as in other shonen. As I said, every good part was ruined in this series, so the only parts that left were the average ones. Thus, battles couldn't become interesting and thrilling like in other series. At the very last, I liked the fact that the battles were pretty short.",

    Soul Eater has to be one of the best anime I've ever watched. It's full of comedy, the plot flows smoothly even for a 51 episode anime, and there's never a dull moment. You get everything with this anime from shipping to humor to sadness. The plot twists are simply amazing and shocking, and it keeps you guessing at points and thinking at others. The action also isn't standard with simple gun battles or clashing sword fights. Sure, they use different kinds of weapons, but the way they use them is what keeps the watcher enthralled because it isn't all clashing weapons and flair. We\
          \
        don't get the 'almighty' beaten-until-you-can't-move-just-to-pull-out-more-power moves, the characters find their powers and strength through natural courses of training that we get hints of. It's just enough to understand without dulling you out of your mind as well, which is nice since that means it isn't long-winded. The art is awesome as well, with creep factors through the roof where they should be and lighter feelings to certain characters coming into play well. My favorite is Lord Death's 'cheerful' look, and the main antagonist, the keishin, sure does a good job at being uber creepy. The Halloween theme to the anime was also an amazing change to others of it's kind. (The moon sorta creeped me out XD) Ninjas and Shinigami (Bleach ones) are nice, but in this every character has their own unique look from Black Star's punk-ish look to Soul's razor teeth and white hair, all the way to Kid's symmetrical outfit, and then to Excalibur's... very weird appearance. (He made me think of an otter/ant-eater crossover o-O) And the voice acting in the dubbed version could not have been more perfect. At first, I was skeptical of Black Star's voice while the other's fit perfectly, but in less than 6 episodes, I couldn't imagine him sounding any other way. The idea of people turning into weapons was also interesting. I would have loved to know more about this, but I plan on reading the manga and hope it's a bit more explained.\
Either way, I really recommend this anime to anyone needing a breath of fresh air from the regular battle types. It's a lot of fun, and it'll definitely make you laugh and feel and love it. I thought for sure it was going to be episodic with 'new' repeated adventures but I was wrong. And I'm happy for it.\

    Soul Eater is a shonen anime that aired in 2008. Don't let its demographic put you off, though; this anime has a little something for everyone.\
There are two arcs in this anime: first, the Medusa arc, and second, the Arachnophobia arc. The first arc follows the main characters' fight against the witch Medusa. There is an equal balance of action and comedy, as well as a few shocking episodes. This arc flows pleasantly and was the more enjoyable of the two.\
The second arc introduces a new enemy: Arachnophobia. This half of Soul Eater is more serious and less humorous. There are lots of things going\
          \
        on, and it confused me. I found this to be the duller of the two arcs. However, there are intense parts and a plot twist or two. Overall, the story is alright.\
The art for Soul Eater is a strong point. It has a cartoony flair but still retains anime characteristics. Consistency is shown throughout the anime; its quality is unwavering. I feel that the mood was set well, from the moon with blood coming from its mouth and the laughing sun to the graffiti on the basketball court. As for the animation, it was never really choppy or unpolished.\
Like the art, the sound is top notch and sets the mood. There are two openings and four endings that all compliment the anime. Throughout every episode there is rock and/or hip hop music to fit in with the situation, as well as sound effects dispersed commendably. The English voice acting is excellent, but unfortunately the dub is incomplete. I watched all of the dub, and the voice actors really put emotion into the characters.\
There are many characters present in Soul Eater. Most of them have an interesting back story or personal struggle over the course of fifty-one episodes. You will definitely be able to connect to at least one character, if not several of them. Even some of the enemies are likable. All supporting characters contribute to the story, whether it be causing a problem or comic relief; the term \"supporting characters\" takes on a literal meaning.\
Soul Eater is an enjoyable series overall. I found myself giggling at the jokes, gasping at the plot twists, and watching episode after episode. If you like Gurren Lagann and/or FLCL, this anime will not disappoint. However, if you want a very mature, serious anime, you may want to try something else.\

    Having finished this anime, I feel emptiness inside. That's quite general, but it's more prominent here than in case of most others, because I've really grown to like the whole universe. Although the plot seems a bit cliché'd at the beginning, it gets more dense as you make progress with it. It gets more and more intense as it unfolds, and not because it's so complex - au contraire, it actually consists of the simplest things: good and evil, friend and foe, survive or die. That's all there is to it, really, but the way you experience these, it makes you think, however unintentionally or\
          \
        subconsciously, and reflect it to your own life, inspecting that in the light of what you see on the screen. As I said, nothing special, but it gets into your head and you ponder on a lot of issues.\
The characters are really awesome: they have their own stories, motivations, intentions - they have their depths and they evolve throughout the course of the story. This all makes them absolutely loveable, and I bet everyone can find at least one or two favorites that you're gonna miss when you finish the series (regardless of how utterly stupid or annoying they'd come off as at first). Even the minor ones are noticeable.\
Art - now that's just mindless. In the good way, of course, but really...I'm still not over the laughing moon with blood trickling through its teeth...just to mention my favorite. As if the creators managed to give a twist to most everything that you'd see as completely cliché'd basically everywhere else - while that'd put off some ppl from watching, those who persist will get used to it so much so that it all will seem normal. The music rocks too, I suggest getting all that you can, because it's totally enjoyable in its own too - especially the character songs: they aren't IN the anime, actually, but even without understanding Japanese, I can't help but feel that they do really grasp the personality of the characters they're about. Epic win!\
All in all - the series manages to remain one that's easy to watch, despite presenting (not even necessarily the good way) overwhelming and intense situations; humor is definitely in it, even in times of ~grave danger~... And that actually backfires a bit too: if you're looking for FUN, do give it a try, chances are you'll love it; if you're trying to conve...I mean, convince someone that anime is good, don't try convincing them with this one. Mindless humor, the characters' inappropriate posings that may occur ANYTIME disrupting the plot - anime-virgins will not appreciate these.\
And a word of advice: beware of Excalibur - it shows up, you better run for your life.\

    As someone relatively new to anime, i found soul eater to be quite a change from the world of anime i had experienced before. I became quite attached to the strange new concepts of magic and witchery, as i have not come across anything like it before. The Initial scenes of the first kill and eat by Soul Eater Evans and Maka certainly sets up the show from my point of view, and creates a certain level of anticipation and some good hopes for the remainder of the show, which certainly were fulfilled. I also highly enjoyed some of the humor and use of friendships\
          \
        in the group, especially concerning the tight bond between the unlikely couple, Tsubaki and Black Star - in my books on of the nicest friend/partner relationships in my anime experience. Throughout the show, reasonably small as it may be, i developed some strong attachments to Black Star, for his courage and trust for Tsubaki and his friends, even through huge amounts of pain and suffering, in the same way that those that watch Naruto and Naruto Shippuden have experienced the perseverance and strength to stray strong through such situations displayed by naruto - e.g. with Sasuke and Tsunade. One turn down for me in the show, in regards to character appearance, was the strange use of teeth, noses and eyes - particularly the noses. In the setting, it can be understood that the 'humans' may not be complete human as we can see through the weapon transformation abilities however the use of sharp, animal like teeth certain is confusing and not desirable, even for the setting. The biggest problems of all for me in the characters was the noses. Maybe the writers and producers wanted a unique approach at facial work, however upturned pig noses, with peaked or wrinkled ends certainly seemed ugly and did nothing for me as a watcher. Finally, the largest and most surprising shameful letdown was the ending, which for me would go down as one of the most shockingly-written finales in anime history, or even digital media for that matter. The fact the series finished with the mysterious 'courage punch' which was able to somehow overcome a kishin demon god of monstrous power, is blatantly bullshit. The entire ending saga came across as wrong, and badly written, with the mysterious and dark demon god suddenly portrayed as a Ragnarok-type character loud outbursts and laughing/taunting which is a complete flip on the character build up of the demon god. The fact that the demon god was fazed, let along beaten by the group of strong amateur meisters and weapons was poorly constructed and really though a bad light over the show, in whole. all in all, with great art i rate the show 6 out of 10, with much more of a chance with a different ending - like the manga\

    Probably the best anime I've ever watched. It was absolutely HILARIOUS and had a lot of life lessons as well as being enjoyable!\
The story was really creative and well thought out.\
The art was fantastic (i actually thought it was better than the manga... :S).\
Sound was brilliant, I have all the songs on my itunes ^^\
Characters were phenomenal. Some were especially funny as well (Shinigami-sama and Spirit-kun) and some maybe underrated characters like Mifune and Justin were also really awesome. I loved Death the Kid and his weapons, Maka and Soull, Black Star and Tsubaki - they were all funny and awesome! xD We never got\
          \
        to see Maka's mum, which is a shame but I suppose she remains a mystery! I LOVED Maka's dad and I think he cared about her more then she could imagine! :) All the other Shinigami students like Ox were awesome as well and Sid-sensei and Stein. Medusa was a good villain, not like Arachne and Mosquito...anyway, characters were BRILLIANT.\
I enjoyed it to the maximum!\
Overall a whopping 10! ^^ And I will be buying the series soon on DVD ^^\

    I thought this anime was pretty awesome. I loved the characters, especially Kid/Stein/Spirit/Excalibur/Soul/Crona/Everyone...They were well thought out and funny. I found there to be a bit too much filler for this to be an absolute favorite of mine, but its still up there pretty high. It took me about half of season one until I really got into this and even then it was hit and miss. I thoroughly enjoyed season 2 though and was watching episodes back to back to see what would happen. The only problem was that when the season ended, the story arc stalled and I think thats why season 3\
          \
        was a let down. I was bored during some episodes and the plot was running thin. However, the final season was a blur of awesome action violence, great overall plot arcs and emotions so it bumped this one back up for me. The final episode was hit and miss (and cheesy), but the fourth and second season arcs were so fucking cool. I love the characters and the voice actors and the personality quirks. A nice blend of action, humor, and imagination which, unlike the kishin, I'm glad to experience.\
Overall, a fun and exciting ride with some bumps along the road. 7.5/10\
Watched dubbed. All of my favorite voice actors are in it.\

    Story 8/10: This anime is very good in terms of the story with few problems that manga readers would recognize. The beginning of Soul Eater  seems to be a run of the mill story on how these characters get though monsters and surviving school. But while you keep watching more episodes  you would see the story getting more complex,  the fight are getting better, some characters have very good development later on. The ending was satisfying ending for me and it was rushed and dumb on how it ended,\
Art/Animation 9/10: the animation fits very well with the world of Soul Eater. the\
          \
         fights  are very well animated and have good pacing. there  were few times that that animation  weren't very good, i do not  blame that that on the studio they have a budget  like any other animation studio.\
Sound 8/10: The voice actors were fitting for the characters and personality, even though some the voice have annoy the hell of me.  The background music was fitting to enhanced the atmosphere  and the situations the characters were in. The 1st opening of Soul Eater is one of my favorite openings in anime.\
Characters 8/10: the characters have quirks and personality have them flesh out and unique. The main villain of the story did so many things that will make  you hate his/hers guts especially what he/her did before the main story.  I know iit wasn't the studio  intention wasn't  to make her, but i dislike Maka. Because she act like a Mary Sue and personality was annoying me to no end in the  anime. The character I remember the most  is Crona Gorgon. I know that he is a side character, but his personality and  his backstory  make him in my top 25  favorite anime characters .\
Enjoyment 8/10: The series was enjoyable to me for me because how i love the characters(most of them), the fights and the overall story in general. I just wish that that they follow the manga and fix the ending.\

And Maka she is strong,stubborn, unlike other female anime characters. And there is Death the kid, i think he looks the best in there and he is also really funny. There is Black star he has a really big ego and i like it(i like people who are\

        confident) Then there is tsubaki, she seems nice but she is really powerful and there comes Liz and Patty , they are sisters ,liz is a more mature person more like normal teenage girls and patty the happy go lucky one. and medusa she is a real villian she have lots of stategies i personally think this anime should get a higher review. i just REALLY love it :D \

    Oh boy, Soul Eater.  Where to start with this one?\
Soul Eater, produced by anime studio Bones in between Fullmetal Alchemist and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, follows the adventures of tomboy Maka as she attends the Death Weapon Meister Academy (or DWMA) in Death City and seeks to transform Soul, her human/weapon partner, into a Death Scythe. If you’re confused by that bare-bones plot description, don’t worry: the show forgets about this plotline—as it does with many others—midway through the series, instead shifting gears toward a big, dumb, good vs. evil denouement. While there’s nothing wrong with this in itself, the chronic “plot amnesia” that Soul\
          \
        Eater suffers from prevents it from being anything more than a decent Shonen series with a rather generic story. (Although, to the show’s credit, the animation is quite good and the first OP is amazing.) \
My biggest gripe with Soul Eater is that the writing is inexcusably lazy. It sometimes feels like entire episodes are missing, particularly during the first ten episodes or so. There are just so many glaring narrative gaps that are never properly addressed or resolved in-show. For example (minor spoilers ahead): Black Star and Death the Kid—Maka’s “human” classmates who round out the main cast—go from rivals/enemies to best friends over the course of two-ish episodes, with no explanation as to how or why their relationship dynamic changed so dramatically in such a short period of time. Also, why on earth did Blair the cat-witch decide to move in with Soul and Maka, especially after they tried to murder her in episode 1 (and actually succeeded in doing so)? And who was it that killed Sid the teacher, and why was he killed in the first place? I could go on and on (and please note: the aforementioned gripes are only from the first ten or so episodes). Yes, these might be nitpicks and I shouldn’t let them detract from my viewing experience to such a degree (I call this the “turn off your brain” argument). However, oversights like these continue to pile up as the series progresses, making it exceedingly difficult for someone like me—who has an admittedly overbearing critical eye when it comes to plot details and character motivations—to watch and enjoy what’s happening with no reservations.\
This leads us to Soul Eater’s trainwreck of a final episode, with an out-of-nowhere (and completely pointless) transformation sequence, utter disregard for the show’s previous emphasis on teamwork, and a resolution that is insultingly, staggeringly dumb in both concept and execution. In fact, the ending of Soul Eater is among my least-favorite anime endings ever, joining the ranks of Guilty Crown and Clannad After Story (and this is coming from someone who otherwise adores After Story). As with the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist series, Bones once again fell into the trap of producing an anime adaptation of an ongoing manga and subsequently being forced to come up with an original ending, with less-than-satisfying results. However, while many fans of the Soul Eater franchise hope the series receives the “Brotherhood” treatment from Bones down the road, I’ve also heard that the manga’s original ending isn’t too much to write home about either (let’s just say that reading about the villain Asura’s “evil Clown army” on Soul Eater’s Wikipedia page gave me several moments of pause).  \
I’ve been pretty harsh on Soul Eater up to this point, but the show does have its fair share of positives. Medusa is one of my favorite anime villains, both in her design and her personality, and the way she plays off of and manipulates Dr. Stein—the DWMA’s resident mad scientist—is the highlight of the series for me. Medusa’s relationship with her son Krona is also just the right level of messed up, and Krona himself is a much more complex and psychologically interesting character than Maka, Soul, or anyone else from the main cast. Additionally, the English dub is solid across the board (it is a Bones show, after all, which I’ve found have had better success than most animes in receiving good dubs). There are some genuinely hilarious moments as well, particularly episode 14 where all the characters are cramming for a test (with each of their approaches perfectly in sync with their personalities).\
Overall, Soul Eater gets a (very generous) 7/10 from me. The show isn’t bad per se, but it could have been a lot better. I would still recommend it, especially to young or inexperienced anime viewers as a perfect “gateway” anime. Also, pro tip: feel free to skip the three Excalibur filler episodes (it wouldn’t be a shonen series without filler, after all). Despite having some good gags and facial expressions here and there, the episodes contribute nothing to the main plot and are mostly annoying (I’ll stick with the Excalibur from the Fate series, thank you).\

    SPOILERS! \
_________\
What started out as a fun shonen romp with interesting characters and settings turned into a generic 'defeat the newly awakened ancient evil' plot.  \
This is not, of course, anywhere near enough to consign a story to the 'meh' category.  No, what really sunk this show was the lack of any resolution whatsoever.  For the first time in my life, I can say this of a story: NOT A SINGLE CHARACTER ARC HAD ANY RESOLUTION.  Not a one.  That's the biggest problem with this story.\
Maka and Soul's relationship remained pretty much the same.  This goes for the rest\
          \
        of the maesters as well.  Nothing changed.  No one truly lost anything or realized something new about themselves.  \
The only exception to this was Chrona.  He was the only character with development.  He started out as a timid fighter with a weak spirit and a mindless loyalty to his mother, the witch Medusa.  His soul was overshadowed by his weapon, the demon sword, which lived inside him.  He eventually became friends with Maka and switched sides.  The demon sword, which had before manifested as a hulking brute, now looked small.  That was a cool idea.  Just one problem...THAT'S WHERE IT ENDS.  Chrona has one last foray back into evil when Medusa regenerates, but he never becomes stronger, never realizes anything, never loses anything.  None of the characters do. \
And here's another thing: no one dies.  I mean NOBODY.  No stakes.  While the escapes and comebacks were never truly contrived, the 'superhero deaths' got very annoying.  \
Here's the second biggest problem: no plot arcs had satisfying resolutions.  A lack of character development is matched by an equally lackluster handling of the plot.  Most of the introduced elements are either addressed once as if vitally important and are never mentioned again, or are cast aside completely.  \
Here's some examples.  The wolf man who stole the Grand Witch's eye?  They took two episodes to break him it of prison, and what does he do?  Serve as a flunky that never accomplished anything.  Same for the frog witch and the mouse witches.  All of these people served one role (all of them foggy) and disappeared into the background.  They never truly served a purpose.  \
There were too many characters and too many directions the plot could go.  First it was a 'collect the souls and become a death scythe.'  Then that vital character detail was forgotten, replaced by 'prevent the ancient evil from awakening'.  Boooooring.  It was a cool academy idea, and they threw it away.  Also, Arachnay was pointless.  They played her up as even more dangerous than Medusa (who, let's admit, was awesome), but we never got to see her fight.  Not once. Not a single attack.  Then she suddenly has this weird love thing the the keishan, and dies like a complete loser when the author forgot to deal with her after the keishan starts fighting.  She had no purpose, except as an antagonist to the 'gather the magic plot coupons' arc.  Boooooooring.  \
Get rid of her and keep Medusa.  She was great.  Her plan to both force the academy into a fight it couldn't win while also getting immunity?  Priceless.  An evil plan that actually makes sense.  How refreshing.  Oh, and let's not forget Stein.  His story was interesting, but it really ended abruptly and with no fanfare.  \
Fanfare...  No, not that.  Wrong word.  \
Finality.  The conclusions to every arc, whether plot or character, ended abruptly.  Mofune doesn't do anything and suddenly he's a good guy.  Black Star wants to be stronger for no reason, gets his ass kicked, and one deus ex machina later he's on to the next plot point (this happens more than once).  The enchanted sword?  Just...fixed.  Maka and Soul's dissonant wavelengths? Never addressed.  The rest of the witches?  Never got involved (WHY?).  Medusa just...dies.  Her first death was great.  In fact, everything up to that point was great.  It's as if the author decided to stop caring entirely after the fantastic fight between Death and the keishan.  \
I'll give this show credit.  Before the end of the first season, it was great.  My mind was blown when Death popped up and started kicking ass.  That was incredible.  It was like seeing Goku turn Super Saiyan for the first time, it was handled so well.  If the author had just stuck with the many elements he already had, rather than introducing Arachnophobia (which was DUMB), it would have been great.  Deal with the wolf man.  See what happens with the witches.  Kill off the keishan and make the rest of the story revolve around the characters and villains we already know.  Keep Medusa dead and make her the voice inside Stein's head, like a ghost.  Bring in the witch coven.  Make the grand witch get her eye back or something.  Something!  It's a pity. \
Instead, the ending of the show was utterly dissatisfying, but the second half of the show was so mediocre that I wasn't even mad.  Deus ex machinas and 'power of love' victories were all over the place anyway.  But it just...ends.  Two minutes after that dumb final battle, the show fizzles.  No final words. \
Just a few end credit scenes to show that the author truly did not care to wrap things up properly (and apparently STILL didn't have the guts to kill Medusa for real).  \
I will give the climax one bit of credit though.  When Maka delivers the final blow to Ashera and says that the bravery that all humans have can defeat him, the music, sound, and movement stops as Ashera's calm voice remarks: \"Everyone has it, huh?  ...Then it's just like madness\".  Boom.  Silent explosion. That was great.  It implied something about the universal traits of humanity that maybe proved him right in a way.  \
Unfortunately, that's the only saving grace of the climax and really of the whole second season. Anything featuring Medusa was great, but none of the arc were taken all the way.  There were too many, and the author kept rushing into new ones, leaving unfinished ones behind in the process.  \
Bottom line:  a series with a killer, 9/10 first half that performed horribly in its second half.  Still, the first half was awesome enough to warrant recognition.",

    Soul eater is the kind of anime I wish I could have made. I love the stylised art and the unique soundtrack and even the characters stood out in the very crowded field of fighting shounen heros.\
If you like all your anime to look a little bit special then soul eater satisfies, its got this awesome chunky style with a little bit of a Halloween/Adam's family twist. It's low on detail, high on impact and is just shonen done right. Even the soundtrack is pretty interesting. To be honest its not really my favourite style but what I loved is the way the art style,\
          \
        the story and the music all fit together. This wasn't cobbled together with whatever is popular but it was consider as a whole and I really appreciated that.\
The characters are great, they have a good mix of them, they all play off each other to make this a really funny show and I loved watching them work together and get stronger. Even their more ridiculous traits are sold well by the solid story telling. I have to confess I am a tiny bit of a feminist:P Even though I know shounen is primarily for boys, as a female I get a little excited when the female characters got to work along side the guys and get stronger. The point isn't that this is somehow a feminist work, it's REALLY not, the point is even the women characters are interesting and move beyond their stereotypes. Particularly of course the female lead. This is a show where the characters work together in really interesting partnerships which is interesting when contrasted to the Krillin effect where characters are cast aside as the lead character gets stronger. Its the heart and soul (no pun intended) of this show and for me makes it stand out amongst all the shonen I have watched as one of the better ones.\
Should you watch it? Probably. It's funny, they fight, they get stronger, they pose and look badass, what more could you want?\

    I'm writing this review in a WEIRD and roundabout way and will almost certainly change it at some point (when I've actually watched the series to the end) but still... I thought now would be a good time to just jot down some of my initial thoughts on what is my first ever anime series... Well actually I tell a lie, I did watch SOME anime as a kid, the likes of Pokémon and YuGiOh and their various spinoffs. (I was a nineties kid, that stuff was unavoidable!)\
BUT I never watched them to completion, freeview tv being what it was (and still is) they never\
          \
        aired cartoons in any real semblance of order. \
That being said I still really enjoyed the episodes that I did get to watch as a kid, and I had always been interested in finding more anime shows to watch. This never happened of course because of my shoestring budget and the pricy cost of DVD boxsets. \
Anyway. So far soul eater is great. I'm enjoying the series immensely and I hope my level of enjoyment and immersion in the show will continue. \
I don't really feel well versed enough in anime to comment on the visuals, the sound or the dubbing in any great detail and I'll leave commenting on characters till the end because I know there's still a crap tonne of character development left to come in the 30 something episodes that I still need to watch but for a first experience of anime, in its full, unadulterated and unabridged format Soul Eater is an immensely entertaining watch even if so far the story hasnt had time to fully establish itself.

    Soul Eater is an anime that talks about a school called \"Shibusen\" which Meister handle people who have the ability to turn into weapons for the purpose of collecting Kishin eggs, maintaining peace in the world. In addition, the weapon that eating 99 kishin eggs and 1 witch soul, becomes a \"Death Scythe\", a very powerful weapon.\
The anime begins with the first 3 episodes serving as introduction to the main characters: Maka and Soul, Black Star and Tsubaki, Death The Kid and Liz and Patty. The Soul Eater's narrative is simple and often somewhat episodic. However, at some point, it is replaced by a continuous\
          \
        plot which constitutes multiple issues that end up leading to the \"nucleus\". \
Ah! I forgot to mention one thing. Soul Eater is a very fun anime. When you least expect it, the 24 minutes have passed. Sometimes, for a few action scenes, it has a funny situation. This may not please to some people.  \
The characters are the strongest point of Soul Eater. Although caricatured, they are extremely captivating. Each has a unique feature. And what is most amazing, is their relationship with each other. It is so natural! They really look like true friends. Joking, playing basketball, talking, discussing. It seems the kind of relationship you possibly have had or have. The only problem is that unfortunately they do not get much development during the series.\
The secondary characters are very interesting. Some of them receive some development, but nothing extremely deep (with the exception of Chrona). We cannot forget to mention a very memorable character, the annoying guy who no one wants around, Excalibur. Your eccentric way earned me a lot of laughs.\
Another positive point of Soul Eater is your world. A moon with psychopath's face and a sun with a bored face. No one would mistake Soul Eater with another anime after seeing this. This world is a crazy mix of halloween with hip-hop. The influence of Hip-hop can be seen even in the clothes of the characters and the soundtrack.\
About animation, nothing to complain about. The trace is a little cartoonish, however, the animation is excellent and has many sakugas. The color, though simple, is very beautiful and pleasant. Quality seal!\
Regarding the openings, endings and ost's, they are excellent! It's that super memorable soundtrack, which makes you go back to listen again. As I have said, the soundtrack has influence in hip-hop. Quality seal!\
Now we go to that boring part of the review ...THE FINAL EPISODES OF THE ANIME.  In the last episodes of Soul Eater, the story begins to decline. Characters that had an interesting purpose, was left with weak purposes. And the final, honestly, got very poorly executed for such a cool show. It's like they throw several things in the last minutes. Predictable and forced. And the final minutes leave an air: \"?? Is it over?\". Still, Soul Eater qualities excel over the defects.\
Resume:\
Positive points:\
* Cool world\
* Captivating Characters\
* Excellent animation / soundtrack\
* Very entertaining\
Negative points:\
* There is not much character development\
* Final average / mediocre\
Personal note:  9/10\

          \
        special weapons and fighting evil spirits). I personally don´t feel like its´ a rip off, because \"Soul Eater\" has a very own feeling to it. The art and animation, the choreography and characters has their own uniqueness about them. I had put off watching \"Soul Eater\" for a long time, mainly because I saved it as a \"safe bet good show\" -card. And I wasn´t disappointed. Now I will get in to why I enjoyed the so much and of course some small details I think could have been done better.\
Story: 8/10\
\"Soul Eater\"has not a particularly unique or original plot (high school aged kids fighting evil and villains and faces challenges along the way). Most anime don´t so it´s not a bother for me at least. For me it´s more how the creators have used the concept - and in \"Soul Eater\"´s case I think it´s done great in many ways. The story follows the Death Meister Weapon Academy´s (DMWA) students Maka, Soul, Black Star, Subaki, Death the Kid, Patty and Liz. Meister stands for a wielder of a weapon and weapons are humans that transform into different weapons that the meister can wield and rid the world of evil beings that had their soul corrupted. The first episodes explores the three main \"teams\" (mentioned above) of characters and are very episodic. Actually the first 15 episodes or so are episodic but still reveals important details and starts to build up the plot - for me that works. In a little longer show that´s almost expected. After that the show getting it´s momentum and the episodes flows more into each other. The show has a good way of binding and knitting pieces and bits together over time, that makes me feel that the show was well thought through and that most things that was brought to light had a satisfactory closure (minus a few things - you will know what I´m talking about). I don´t expect every little detail explained or justified in this kind of show - especially not when the premises is set like they are in \"Soul Eater\", they are pretty wacko. And it´s was the wacko, edgy, cool feeling about \"Soul Eater\" that drew me in and made it stand out to me. The first half of the show is more comedy dominated with some more serious moments. The second half of the show is the other way around, the tone of the show grows more serious and are brightened up by some lighter moments. I personally think the plot and it´s characters are strong enough to make the mode shift and carries it well (actually enjoyed the second part a little bit more). Some extra cred to the excellent action scenes! \"Soul Eater\" definitively has some great action. The fights are short, intense and and fill there purpose very well. One big minus for me was how the end fight was resolved. It may work for you but after a so cool and spot free up build and fights it just fell flat to me.  In my opinion it could had been done in a so better way (hence the 8 instead of a 9 or 10). It´s a filler or two, but nothing major. \
Art: 9/10\
\"Soul Eater\" definitely has a unique art style. It took me a couple of episodes to get used to and after that I loved it. It matches the wacko, edgy, cool tone of the plot and characters - it´s just an explosion of abstract colors, lines and angles hat will make your head spin. The art and animation is absolutely one of the things that really makes this show stand out against it´s siblings. The backgrounds always has some crazy funny details and are very colorful - adapted to the mood of the scene or how the character visualized it. Greatly done in my opinion. The characters has their own unique design that makes them feel very \"Soul Eater\" and can not ever be confused with some other show. The choreography is also a highlight in \"Soul Eater\" - especially the fight/actions scenes. They are always spot on. You just have to see your self to now what I mean - words are wasted trying to describe them (example Maka with her scythe Soul or Death the Kid with his guns Patty and Liz). Facial expressions are also very clear and strong, which makes it easy for you to grasp the type of character and whats he/she feels at the moment. The creators also uses the characters eyes a lot to drive home a feeling or an expression - just awesome.\
Sound: 8/10\
The soundtrack is very jazz/rock influenced. I personally isn´t into jazz all that much but it suited the show really well. The music was often well coordinated to the mood of the scene and characters. I really liked the two openings and the last ending song. They also follows the mood and mood changes of the show pretty well. The first opening is up beat and care free tone to it with great visuals that screams \"Soul Eater mode\" all the way. The second one has a more usual \"anime\" tone to but follows the more serious tone that the show takes on. Backgrounds sound was well matched and paced, it worked really well in my opinion. Swords clashing together, running footsteps,  high fives and so on was nailed and believable. I watched the dubbed version and liked it a lot. I think the VA´s was well matched to respective character and brought them to life and suited their personality. If you have watched your fair share of dubbed anime you will probably recognize all of them (especially if you have watched the dubbed version of Fairy tail).   \
Character: 9/10\
One of the things I loved most about \"Soul Eater\" was the characters and their interactions. They all had their characteristic personalities and names and aren´t meant to be relateable. The are pure fiction and are meant to be over the top - which I like with this show. You aren´t supposed to feel that you can relate to the story and the characters - they are a crazy, wacko extreme personalities that you are going to enjoy watching. With that said the show and it´s characters dosen´t lack in messages and good words of wisdom. How we choose our path and grow with each lesson. How we should be able to trust each other without to have to understand each other fully. The power of forgiveness and friendship (which seems to be a theme in all this kind of shows). And mostly I liked the relationships between the three meisters and their weapon the most. Maka (meister) and Soul (weapon), Black Star (meister) and Subaki (weapon), and Death the Kid (meister) and Patty and Liz (weapons). They all (Meister and Weapon) had pretty much polar opposite personalities. And despite that their souls where connected in a way that they could cooperate and get stronger together (I know, typical shounen but I love it). How they complemented each other and learned from their differences was a great part of the show. The show also contained a lot of great side and minor characters - no character was boring to me. They were all interesting, funny, super evil, crazy or just smart-asses. All with their role play, which they did great in my opinion. I especially loved professor Stein, whom I actually thought was kind of sexy - I know, weird but what the hell. For character development the characters actually delivered - so much character in this kind of crazy show can develop. But they did, all of them. In all their craziness, traumas and situations some of the character went through felt very real. Mistrust of men because of cheating father, the fear of your inner demons, the will to become stronger so that your partner won´t get hurt and so on. It gave \"Soul Eater\" a depth to me beyond the funny, wacko, crazy side. \
Enjoyment: 9/10\
I had a really good time watching this show. I enjoyed myself so much that I watched it all in a weeks time. Just click on forth the next episode kind of enjoyment. The unique art style, the wacko craziness, shining characters and a solid plot kept me watching this in a fast pace. I laughed, was intrigued, at time spaced out, and even cried at some parts. It had it all to me that a great shounen/action anime should have and delivered it in it´s own way - absolutely great.\
Overall: 9/10\
Some minor things kept me from call it outstanding but it was definitely a great show. \"Soul Eater\" is absolutely worthy of the attention is still gets. It´s one of those shows that any anime fan should have seen, at least given a try. I recommend this show to any shounen/action/comedy fan that hadn´t the pleasure to bite in to it yet. Like all other shows it may not be for everyone, but for shore for most of you people. And it definitely contains some of the best action scenes out their to date - real class.    \

    The quality of animation is awesome, I think this is the most beautiful art make by Bones and one of the best in all animes. Congratulations for studio Bones, they make a greatful job in all technical criterias.\
All characters have a indescribable charisma, this is worth to Atsushi Ohkubo (manga autor) that makes the work so great. \
This is one of the best enjoyment in a shounen anime that I've seen, the comedy, the actions scenes and the story works perfectly at least until episode 30-33 when the fillers started.\
Trust me, this anime is the most example of how fillers can crash a anime and\
          \
        this is what makes me sick about it. If the anime follows the manga could be a top 10 anime, but unfortunately this don't happens.\
The anime is not so bad, the fillers are better then much original anime ends, but when you read the manga you see how disappointing is the anime. I don't know why this happens (and I don't wanna know).\
For me it's a 8, just for the first half of the anime, what I recommend is read the manga\

    I consider myself generous when I rate anime because I enjoy most animes and don't have any regrets for watching them so I haven't rated anything below a 5 except for Soul Eater, by far the worst anime I've watched. I'm shocked that this anime has good reviews because it was hard for me to sit through the 51 episodes.\
Story:  The story is incredibly formulaic of the shonen genre. There isn't even much to make you want to keep watching. Also, the story is incredibly childish and I didn't sign up to watch a kids show. \
Art: 2\
Ugh. I get it, they took a\
          \
        risk. Some may have liked it but I found it dreadful. Everyone looks hella ugly and everything is too cartoonish. The worst part is how they gulp down the souls; it just makes me cringe.\
Sound: 4\
I have to admit the 2nd opening is pretty darn good. Other than that, the openings and endings were either decent or just weird. The sound is still pretty bad but it might be the best part of the anime.\
Character: 2\
Here comes the real shithole. I hated almost all of the characters except for Frankenstein, Death the Kid, and Excalibur. Maka was a terrible lead who was ugly, not exciting at all, and pretty annoying, and Evan was emo and useless. But the character I hate most from any anime came from this and that is Blackstar. If it wasn't for this piece of shit I might have even given this anime a 5. So be prepared to deal with this incredibly arrogant and annoying brat.  His 9 year old ass made this anime 10 times more childish than it already is. I've never wanted to see a main character die so badly as I did  Blackstar even though it wasn't going to happen.\
Enjoyment: 4\
I still hated this anime but I guess it was a bit funny at parts. Characters like  Maka's dad and Excalibur made the anime not unwatchable at certain parts\
Overall:3\
Don't waste your time with this.\

    OK, after giving 3 reviews to mediocre shounen series, I decided to review some really good shounen anime so you could see what does a good shounen look like. Soul Eater is the very first anime where I watched all the episodes in order, so I thought it would be perfect to review, since it's practically the series that got me into anime.\
The animation and sounds are both great. The unique and less realistic art style and animation make this anime stand out at the first sight. It also gets an award for the creepiest moon and the sun design I've ever seen.\
The first opening\
          \
        is easily one of the best anime songs I have ever heard and the 2nd one is also very good. From the endings, I didn't like the punky 1st one and drab 2nd one. However, I really liked the 3rd one even though I don't like hip-hop and the 4th one, sung by one of my favourite J-Rock bands, Abingdon Boys School. The soundtrack is also very solid and memorable and voice acting is also top-notch quality.\
I usually start describing characters at this point, but I'll rather start with the story, it might be generic, but it is very solid and for 51 episodes, (the same amount as the original FMA) the anime is actually pretty fast paced and something actually happens in each episode. (Except 3 Excalibur episodes). There is also a lot of funny moments, which will start to get repetitive quite fast. One thing that I really liked is how this anime puts much more focus on cooperation without forcing all the friendship bullcrap, the system of meisters and weapons is really quite fresh idea and is executed pretty well In My Opinion . I also like how the story takes place in various locations such as Egypt, Italy, Alaska and the sea. But I laughed really hard at the way they portrayed Czech republic. (Seriously, we're not evil Golem creators) I also don't understand why the hell DWMA is located in Nevada and why it takes everyone so fast to travel. Studio BONES also did a very good job when the anime strayed away from the manga at the episode 35, even though at the 40th episode the anime was losing its steam and the ending got a lot of hate and I can see why. (I won't explain obviously.)\
However, The biggest strength of the anime are the characters.\
The Main Trio consists of Maka, Black Star and Kid.\
Maka Albarn (She's named after Damon Albarn LOL) is quite a typical nerdy girl, but sympathetic and independent. Soul Eater Evans (Named after Bill Evans) might be a typical angry punk, but he becomes responsible when needed. I really didn't like Black Star. He was like angrier version of Naruto. His weapon, Tsubaki is however a nice, smart laid back person and definitely doesn't deserve such a stupid meister.\
And then There is Death The Kid, easily the best character in the show and one of the coolest characters ever. He can be described as Max Payne combined with detective Monk He is just extremely badass and funny and his rants about symmetry are some of the funniest anime moments I've ever seen. His Weapons, hyperactive Patty and more serious Liz are forgettable, but funny characters though.\
The secondary trio is however, average at best, except the annoying bookworm Ox Ford.\
Shingiami Sama is a very goofy and memorable character. (I've never seen shinigami portrayed like this.) Maka's father, simply called Spirit is extremely annoying and stupid pervert. Blair is just an annoying fanservice character which ruined my first impressions and the show would've worked without her. Justin Law is the most original way of portraying priest I've seen in anime. (He beats even Wolfwood, seriously, how many priests listen to techno?)\
I won't describe the villains, except saying that they are all not your typical bad guys and each one has something unique in them except Chrona, who is a genderless emo kid.\
Also, unlike most characters in other anime, SE characters actually undergo some development, and more than just getting stronger. Take Black star, after half of the series, he becomes more bearable and Soul develops some feelings for his friends, especially Maka.\
So, do I recommend it? That all depends on the first episode. If you liked it and are into shounen, crazy and unusual art style and can stand a bit of annoying fanservice, you will be rewarded with long, but highly satisfying fighting show with solid humour. If you didn't then give up, you are TOO SANE FOR THIS.\

    This anime is definitely the best I've ever seen. The story just keeps pulling you forward and you never want to stop watching more and more episodes. Also, there are so many different personalities and a lot of them make you laugh. The idea of a person shifting into a weapon is amazing and really cool. The battles are great and they are shown very well. The only problem was that it was a short series, only around 50 episodes. And the ending isn't very good, but you'll like the rest.\

This is going to be a short review, I loved this anime but the whole time I was watching it I had this very confusing feeling about the show. I couldn't tell where they were going and how it was going to end which you would think is a good thing but you'd be suprised. I the beginning I gave Soul Eater an 8.5 but when I saw the ending it ruined this series for me, quite frankly I was disgusted, but I'm not going to give away any spoilers you should check it out for yourself. I do recommend\
          \

    Story:\
The storyline is somewhat cliched and shallow - as it is a comedy anime. The beginning was easy to follow, but got more complicated towards the end, up to the point where it hardly felt like a comedy anymore. The ending gives closure to the anime - as everything ends up getting solved - but there is a feeling of wanting to know more and wanting a continuation.\
Art:\
The art is very distinct, especially the settings - that seem very 'Alice in Wonderland' meets the Grim Reaper like. The faces of insanity are also very distinct and nicely done. The only thing bothering me is that\
          \
        the eyes of the characters (especially Maka and Justin Law) have no reflecting light, which makes them look dull. \
Sound:\
I thoroughly enjoyed all of the opening and endings to Soul Eater. The background sounds, in itself though, do not stand out, and do not enhance the scene much. The only times I've realized the background sounds were playing and it fit the scene well was when Soul was playing the piano, and during most of the battle scenes. \
Character:\
The character designs for Soul Eater are very strong. Each character has very strong, distinct characteristics that separates one from another. Each character leaves a strong impression in one's memory (such as Maka the bookworm, Soul the 'cool' scythe, Black Star the egoist, Tsubaki the one who follows Black Star loyally, Kid who as OCD, Liz who is afraid of ghosts and Patty the stupid kid). Also, the idea of having symbols representing the character, helps greatly in getting familiar with them (such as serpents, spiders, stitches, and mice). \
Enjoyment:\
This anime is great for laughs while also wanting to follow along to a plot. By watching more and more episodes, one will come to love the characters more and more. \
Overall:\
I enjoyed the anime very much, but was a little disappointed at the ending. For those who will only be satisfied with the ending when you see the characters repairing the dammage from 'the final battle', this is not the anime for you. The characters impressed me very much, and even now have a great impression on me even though I have finished the series already. Overall, I highly recommend this to those who enjoy comedy with a plot.\

    In the \"epic\" anime area, most of the well made ones are very famous and popular. Examples incude Naruto, InuYasha and Bleach, and now, possibly Soul Eater.\
Soul Eater brings everything you can have in animes like Inuyasha and Bleach in a more developed way, and with better animation quality.\
\
> STORY:\
Very well adapted, always making sure we know what's going on with every single character, without missing any details. The first half of the season is almost identical to the manga, and shows exactly where the series is going. Unfortunately, the second half leaves things somehow unclear as it is needed to rush to the final\
          \
        battles. \
One very disturbing thing about this anime is how the writers focus so much on all the characters that they don't have time to talk about the main characters - Soul and Maka -, as well as their relationship, which is very clear in the manga and slightly apparent on the anime, but still noticable. With this it doesn't really look like a shounen.\
The final battle is sick, I must say. I really wasn't expecting it to be that awful, but unfortunately it was very disappointing.\
Another disturbing thing is how characters just don't die, even when they clearly die. Only three main characters die in the whole season, and I did count it, if you're wondering.\
All in all, the story is well told, being manga friendly, only making things weird at the very end, and possibly making it impossible to make a second season.\
\
> ART:\
The animation in Soul Eater is very beautiful clearly, and has a cartoonish style that slightly changes depending on the situation, never leaving things unprecise. Special credits to the geniuses who created the crazy moon and sun, which give any environment during the story lots of life. Awesome.\
\
> SOUND:\
OST magically fitting makes every battle, every moment, every episode, very exciting. Funny moments have their own songs, and they fit very well.\
Some battles use actual japanese songs (with someone singing them), and creates a difference from the other OSTs that just isn't fitting.\
\
> ENJOYMENT:\
Being such an ***hole to choose an anime to really watch and enjoy, I am extremely happy to have watched this. Well-developed story and characters made it all truly promising, keeping me glued to the screen at all times. Funny moments and dark moments make it a full pack. \
It was truly enjoyable. \
\
> OVERALL:\
My favourite anime so far. BIG achievement, since like I said, I'm an ***hole when choosing an anime to watch:\
- If you have ever liked watching any adventure animes, this is a real must. \
- Don't let its cartoonish animation let you down, it's darker than it seems, while having the funniest scenes possible.\
- It's a full pack: comedy, adventure, action, mystery, romance.\
- It has AWESOME BATTLES. That's all I have to say about battles.\
- It's full of freakin' awesome characters.\
- Awesome story.\
DON'T MISS IT, and if you want to watch the first episode, watch the fourth, it's the \"actual\" first.\
See ya! ;)\

    First Thoughts :\
I had high expectations for this Anime. But by the time I finished I was disappointed. I know plenty of other people enjoyed this series but something about it didn't seem to work out.\
. What I Liked :\
+ Unique and interesting cast of characters. Each character has an amusing personality which makes them stand out from the rest.\
+ The whole Shinigami school setting is interesting. At first you'd think it's like Bleach but it's quite different.\
+ HD Quality available\
+ Funny when appropriate\
. What I Didn't Like :\
- Initial plot disappears within the first few episodes. Initial plot as in the capture of 100\
          \
        souls.\
- Comedy during inappropriate times when it should be serious.\
- Plot started to drag 1/2 or 3/4 through\
- Some battles are fairly dull\
- Some fillers\
- Ending and final boss was suppose to be epic but ended up being disappointing.\
. In Depth :\
I had high expectations when I started watching this Anime. It started off nicely but the plot you initially thought was going to happen doesn't. Even according to the synopsis it seems like the plot is to capture 100 evil souls, but in a few episodes that plot is abandoned entirely ( well I guess I can see why, given the fact it's only 51 episodes ). But after a few episodes that goal is entirely forgotten for the rest of the series and a bigger plot is thrown at them. While the initial plot was forgotten it was still interesting halfway through. I say halfway through since it felt like it was dragging on after a while ( like Death note ). Story aside I found the comedic personality of this show to be somewhat of a flaw. Many of the times it worked but then comedy is randomly inserted in situations when it should of been serious ( Bleach does this, though perhaps not as bad). Some may not mind this but I find it important to be able to be able to take serious situations seriously. This lowered my overall experienced and I couldn't grasp the supposed \"drama\" that unfolded before my eyes. One of my biggest complaints is the end boss, initially he seemed very mysterious and threatening but with the comedy embedded on him, he didn't seem very threatening and evil compared to the earlier villains. With this in mind, this made the ending quite disappointing, opposite of epic ( Excalibur didn't make it any better ). The ending was fairly cheesy also. In conclusion I felt the series could of been much better perhaps if they didn't sprinkle comedy on everything in sight.\

    Soul Eater is another in a long line of shounen battle anime with its premise revolving around a school called Shibusen that teaches shinigami and their weapon partners that can go in and out of weapon form in hunting evil humans and witches. Three duos/ trios of students are focused on in their developments with Maka and Soul, Black Star and Tsubaki, and Death the Kid and the Thompson sisters and a looming evil threat arises that starts off from a series of events triggered from the witch, Medusa Gorgon. The series essentially mixes around action, adventure and comedy with the Shibusen students and personnel\
          \
        battling against evil threats with their abilities, learning of evil threats and milking comedy off a number of the odd quirks of the characters.\
Before I go into particular issues that Soul Eater goes into, I might as well address the comedy to this series. Many attempts that the show makes at comedy are rather obnoxious and usually kill the mood for serious scenes that develop, particularly during the middle of the show's run when Medusa's plans come to light. A number of the character quirks in the series such as Black Star's hyperactive persona, Death the Kid's obsession with symmetry and Excalibur's egotistic persona are more obnoxious than funny and I have to wonder why the makers of this series would think these would be funny as well. While the comedy of the series does tone down in its second half with the gradually more serious developments, it still makes its presence felt as such where it was more a nuisance than a joy for me.\
In terms of plot, Soul Eater uses the first six episodes of the series to introduce the major characters of the series and the exploration of its world and dynamics such as the Meister/ Weapon partnerships, witches and kishins. Later episodes introduce us to Medusa Gorgon and her cohorts as Medusa manipulates Shibusen into fulfilling her goals and exploring the ramifications of those plans when events escalate in the second half of the series. Medusa made for an intriguing villain for Soul Eater as she was very crafty and manipulative in pushing the members of Shibusen and her cohorts to fulfill her plans and not afraid to get her own hands dirty if others confronted her. Her abuse and manipulation of son Crona also contributed a tragic storyline to the series as more about his character comes to light. On the other hand, Asura, Arachne and the members of Arachnophobia aren't too effective as villains being either rather flat in terms of personality or not getting enough screen time where their characters could be further fleshed out.\
In terms of other characters, they are a mixed bag. Dr. Stein was an intriguing character with the show focusing on his struggles in resisting his dark persona while teaching at Shibusen. Some like Soul and Maka are tolerable as characters, while others like Death the Kid and Black Star are rather unbearable at many points in Soul Eater thanks to their obnoxious personalities and/or quirks. Others introduced like Justin Law and Sid Barrett don't get much in the way of fleshing out as they only exist as either comical relief or to advance the show's plot.\
The final episodes of the series are rather infamous for deviating from its manga source material since it was still ongoing at the time the anime aired. While I haven't read much of the manga, the later episodes still left much to be desired. Asura doesn't have much presence in the series until the show's final quarter despite being hyped as the biggest enemy threat in the series. While being an interesting villain, it was unclear what Medusa's plans clearly were as it seemed she wished to use Asura's power for her own gain in the first half of the series yet had no qualms with him being destroyed by Shibusen in the show's second half. The final episodes also rely too heavily on sudden power upgrades in the final battle with Asura when our main pairs/ trios and comes with a rather underwhelming conclusion that went against what the series was seemingly developing with the relations between the group.\
Visually, Soul Eater's presentation is rather standard in terms of visuals and soundtrack. Still for visuals, it does offer some unique elements that add to the show's setting implementing a Halloween-style theme with a number of the settings and character designs such as Dr. Stein's attire, the outside of Shibusen's headquarters, the twisted looking sun and moon, and Sid the zombie. The series often resorts to animation shortcuts at points such as reused animation frames, speed stripes and jump cuts. But for the most part, fight scenes are enjoyable to see thanks to a number of the characters having rather unique abilities that they use in battle, if you are watching Soul Eater for the action. The soundtrack to the series mostly consists of comical or energetic insert tracks with opener and closer songs consisting of generic J-Rock songs. They're rather unmemorable and don't have much that let them stick out from other shounen battle titles.\
Overall, I'm mostly indifferent to Soul Eater. While having a few interesting characters, it doesn't do much to break the mold for a shounen battle anime, has some obnoxious characters from the show's poor attempts at comedy and has a rather underwhelming final arc due to heavy reliance on plot conveniences and lack of screen time from major villain Asura in the buildup towards it. Unless you're a diehard fan of shounen battle anime, you aren't missing out on much here. \

    heh, I am someone who is fairly patient with animes, and quite easy to please. I created an account so that I could review this anime, because I believe this deserves it(so first review, dont be harsh ;O)\
Story:\
I couldnt find much 'wrong' with the plot, other than a few things still having be unclear at this point. I usually just go with the flow, and only complain when there are huge 'WTF?' moments. I had only done that during the Excalibur episodes. There was also no plot in the beginning episodes, but i dont hold that against them, because they were prologues.\
Art:\
With me being an\
          \
        artist, its difficult for me to watch animes with bad art; which is why i took to soul eater instantly. Even if all of the other aspects but art were bad, I would still watch it for the art. I havent seen too many animes, but I just cut myself off from Naruto and Death Note. This anime was like a refresher for me, especially with the unique elements such as a 'story-book' moon and sun. I dont think I have ever seen that in an anime. But there isnt much fluxuation with the graphics, theyre all very solid and pleasing to the eyes.\
Sound:\
I often find myself tapping my toes along to the beat of the music. It just leaves you feeling awed and up-beat. The music does a very good job of setting the mood.\
Character:\
I find a lot of the characters to be unique and enjoyable. The designs are also like nothing I've seen(Stein having a screw in his head), and each of them has their own obsessions, which can get them into trouble as well as get laughs.\
Enjoyment:\
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, and recomend it to anyone who like light and funny animes with a serious side, or who just like to appreciate the graphics.\
I give it a 10/10\

    I have problems being an anime fan sometimes and it's not social thing (I don't care what the outside world thinks of me liking anime) but because there's alot of aspects I can't stand about anime, one of them is the shonen genre, I despise shonen (at least what everyone typically thinks of when they think shonen) so why do I like Soul Eater so much? Don't get me wrong, it's not perfect by any means but I enjoy it way more than any other in it's genre but why? I think one of the reasons is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, sure\
          \
        it's got it serious moments but never to the point that the show forgets what it is. \
It's filled with all these anime stereotypes: The bookworm (Maka), the \"Cool\" rebel (Soul), the crazy teacher (Stein), the overly protective guardian (Maka's dad, Spirit), the hotheaded idiot fighter (Blackstar), the darkly but nicely dressed serious goth kid that all the ladies in real life want (Death The Kid), the list goes on and the thing is is that I think the creators know that they're all archetypes and that they're going all out with it and that kinda makes it refreshing. \
They don't try to pass this off as \"yeah this is what soul reapers are like\" unlike other Shonen titles (Sure, gangsters are dumb teenagers that have fire on their heads, do street fighter moves and ride on power ranger motorcycles, I'm buying that). Death City (the place where all the characters all live) takes place in Utah, Nevada for crying out loud and with a laughing sun in the sky, this is a completely stylized world where they just go all out with the visuals and the type of characters they have\
It's like Frank Miller's Sin City where that film/comic series is filled with Film Noir stereotypes and none of them act like real people but you don't mind because the world they live in is so stylized and exaggerated that the cliches just become part of the style and that's something Soul Eater certainly isn't short of and that's style. The art in this show is amazing and the animation is even better (It's done by Studio Bones. Enough said)\
The characters like I said are stereotypes but they embrace what they are so much that it's hard not to find them likeable. Ex: I can't really hate Blackstar. Is he annoying? Oh god yeah but that's kinda the point, he's supposed to be annoying. It's not like Naruto where we're actually suppose to find this idiot charming. So yeah, I like all the characters I'm suppose to like but my favorite character however is Dr. Stein, I just love watching him scare the crap out of his students and kick all sorts of ass.\
The story's not bad, it's nothing special but it works\
The music also deserves a mention. While Taku Iwasaki's music is bit overblown for my taste at times, I can't deny the man's got talent and it does work very well for the animes he does like this and Gurren Lagann. The music here is filled with alot of J-Rock and Techno with a mix of Hip Hop, traditional Orchestra and even a little bit of Jazz (Seems ever since Cowboy Bebop, there always has to be at least a little bit of Jazz in your anime soundtrack)\
But like I said, it's not perfect. I kinda feel that 51 episodes is too long for this series, you could've cut it down a bit and the ending... I won't go into alot of details (seeing how everyone else has already ripped this ending a new one anyway). \
Now I haven't read the manga so the differences between this and the manga didn't bother me. I'm not a purist (in fact, I find most purists to be annoying, frankly), I don't believe something needs to stay true to the source material in order to be good. A good adaptation should stand on it's own and I shouldn't have to check out the source material to enjoy it and for the most part I felt that was the case here, I wasn't confused about anything, I felt I knew everything I needed to know and then the ending came and here I could tell something was wrong, it just felt like they just didn't know how to end the series so they pulled some crap that nobody bought but I'll at least give them credit for at least ending the series and not having it just stop with a sequel bait ending like \"We didn't get them this time but we'll get them next time\". Here, the story ended, not very well but at least it ended.\
So do I recommend this series despite my hatred for Shonen and that ending? Yes, most certainly. It's got a great art style, fantastic animation, catchy music, loveable characters, and some great action scenes. It's just hard not to like this anime\

    I. Love. This. Anime.. It's my favorite anime of all time. I knew a lot of people were talking about. I never thought it was that much of a big of a deal, but now that I watched it I see what they meant xD. There were lot of ships, but barely any romance (Sorry Romance lovers). Even if you love romance you'll still like this even though there is none. The ending was a twist (But I won't tell you that). 10 out of 10, 100 out of 1. This is my absolutely favorite anime, I strongly recommend it. \

    Story - 9:\
  The reason I give the story a 9 is because of its unique and intriguing plot. I mean, I never really thought of people turning into weapons, never mind a school where they actually teach you skills in order to eat witch's souls! The only reason I do not give the storyline a perfect 10 is solemnly because the story should have progressed more into detail and define the situation and multiple conflicts a bit more deeply. Another of SE's good points are the intervals between conflicts. This really allows the viewer to relax in between conflicts and not get tired\
          \
        of 30 straight episodes of just fighting, it just sort of gives you a laugh in a serious time in the anime.\
Art - 10:\
  To be honest, I really do enjoy the art in Soul Eater. Like before, it has a very defined and different style that not many shounen are able to acquire. It's very edgy but a bit comedic, which is not like many shounen which are much more serious. \
Sound - 10:\
  I absolutely adore the audio on this anime! It is very rare to find good english dubs, but this anime should receive an award for it! The character's voices generally syncs with their personalities and appearance. Another good point in the sound is the music. The music can range from alternative to relaxing, which really pumps up the anime. The ending themes really get you wanting to see more and the opening themes make you get anxious for what is to happen next! \
Character - 8:\
  The characters overall are very unique and not bland and cliche like much other anime. Every character has their comedic and admirable quirks, and very unusual and fun personalities. The only thing I want to see more of is character development from characters outside the main circle like Kilik or Jacquline. They seem to have shown a bit here and there, but never a real connection towards the viewers. \
 Overall:\
  The general score for this anime is a 9. The anime itself is very heart-lifting and hilarious, but can also deeply get into conflict. The anime surely made a good impression on me, it's basically now a tradition to re-watch Soul Eater with a cold can of coke and some microwaveable popcorn. I highly suggest it for those who are looking for a good laugh and some awesome and unique supernatural action!\

    Well well well...Soul Eater.\
I started watching this anime on the off chance when I was on YouTube and saw a MAD parody of the opening. I watched the opening, read the summery and was very intrigued.\
So I started to watch and was intrigued. Character development was a bit slow in the beginning , but I persevered and was happy.\
The story started getting better and more in the depth and the animation had always been beautiful. The cartoon , straight from the comic book style were stylish and detailed then I would of expected.\
The one thing a can say wrong is that the characters background didn’t\
          \
        come in to it as much as I would of liked. Soul and Black Star’s background will always be a mystery. Maybe the manga tells us more.\
All in all, Soul Eater is a worthwhile and enjoyable anime to watch with great fight scenes, hilarious plot twists and outrageous quirks that will have just skipping along to the next one.\

    Soul Eater, a typical action adventure superpower shounen anime. You'll find the regular shounen stuff in it; comedy, superpowered action, different character personalities, insane power ups and other shounen stuff. But despite all that, it's a very enjoyable series and I liked it very much. Though most people are turned away by the animation, but I can guarantee this anime is a really good pick.\
Story 9/10:\
A school in which students study the art to kill bad spirits. The students are of 2 types; weapons and meisters. But all of them are humans nonetheless. So the good guys are of the school and bad guys are\
          \
        the witches. They fight each other and then a bigger calamity appears which the school has to deal with. Alongwith the main storyline, there is comedy and some filler episodes which are fun to watch.\
Art 7/10:\
Well, it's animation is nothing to praise. It's on the same lines as gurren lagaan and other old shounen anime. If you watch anime based on how they are animated and designed, then this will be quite difficult for you to watch. But if it's about the story, then it'll be a good ride.\
Character 9/10:\
All the characters are pretty awesome. Even some of the teachers are pretty neat. All of them take part in the comedy of the anime. The stories of the main characters are explained and a few side characters as well. But, shounen anime fans will definitely love the characters. Each having their own powers, comedy and story.\
Enjoyment 9/10:\
As I watch anime mostly based on it's story and content, this anime was indeed a very fun one to watch. It's comedy made me laugh and it's fights and storyline kept me glued to the seat and continue watching it until one arc is completed. A few filler episodes come but they are mostly for comedy purpose and you will love them. Not as much comedy as One Piece but still it does make you laugh. The fights and characters themselves are pretty awesome.\
Overall, this was a very good anime to watch and a good pick for anyone who is looking for funny superpowered action shounen anime.\

    Soul Eater was a great inspiration for me when it came to action-packed fantasy, wizardry and folklore. It tells about the story of three gifted meisters and their weapons(who have life as well) who study in a school wherein they are trained to fight against evil.\
This is my second review and I have to say that I've had mixed emotions when I was watching this anime.\
►Story◄\
Plot-wise, the story was top-notch, grasping the essence of both fun in fantasy and moral within hardships. Fillers were enjoyable and there was a lot to look forward to. It flowed like Bleach but obviously, still different in other points\
          \
        like this show excelled in comedy, GREATLY. \
Despite of the fact that the anime's plot stretched away from the manga, it did served a good entertaining story but all that came to an end by the show neared its end.\
Unlike the anime, the manga shown more scenes and more moves that were more enjoyable and most of the audience preferred most from the manga's plotline. \
Hands-down, all of it felt like it was rushed and in the final episode, I was devastated with their final blow to the big boss. It was all \"Digimon\" for me in the end and I was left unsatisfied with nothing to remember about and was left puzzled with the short unexpected events like Maka's sudden ability to become a human scythe.\
So to sum it all up, first half was soaring high in the clouds while the second had turbulence and dived into a volcano. Kid would be disappointed if he looked at it that way. \
\
↕Art↕\
Even thought the concept wasn't as detailed as the other animes I've seen, the artists still captured the feelings and emotions for their character.\
All of them looked different (asides from the constant black attire) and looked memorable. Some, I could even say looked totally hot like Blair and Mizune. \
The environments were great too as both moon and sun had this creepy yet comical look and the coloring within the lighting and shadowing kept me going.\
The weapons were superb but there were times where I wanted to see more of that artistic beauty. Soul looked badass in the first part and then looked cool in the second part. headbands DO look good on guys.\
The facial structures especially when the characters go mad really captured the Western art rather than the eastern. It's a bit old-school but can also be original and unique compared to the other animes.\
♪Sound♫\
This is one of the anime's strong points. The music of each scene really got me going and I have to say that they're quite good to listen to. Especially the tracks played before and during fights. OP and ED themes also reflected both positive and negative feelings of the show but in any way, I was hooked with the soundtrack.\
Sound FX are ok but still, I got the \"been there, heard that\" feeling so there's nothing special to mention but it was still good. Just not to the point wherein it blew me away.\
Voice acting was top-notch. They really grabbed a lot of aces but it did took time for Maka's to grow on me. The rest however fitted their character especially Black Star's, Kid's, Medusa's and Patty's.\
☺Character☻\
All did their roles well and made a good roster for the series. Their weapons really reflected their character and I enjoyed their presence.\
I also liked Kid's attitude for being obsessive-compulsive which can be rare attribute to put into a character. I also liked Stein for being the nutty professor and inspired me in being both cool and wise. Just not the smoking habit...\
The characters were inspirational and given their contributions for the series. My only complaints are -\
1. Why Blair is acting like an extra (fanservice maybe?).\
2. Free and Mizune weren't doing much in the end.\
3. The other Death Gods and whatnot who were mentioned earlier didn't appear.\
4. (Read last sentence on the 4th paragraph on the story corner)\
◘Enjoyment☼\
Like I said in the story - first part was great while the last parts were deplorable.\
Stunts here and there were both funny and cool to look at and I had my share of \"OOH!\"s and \"LOL!\"s.\
The suspense was also great for the mix, giving a little thrill to the talking parts which were quite as exciting as to some of their mindless fights here and there.\
•Overall•\
First half = 5/5\
Second half = 2/5\
Overall = 7\
That was already being generous for me. Honestly, I was gonna make it a 6 but I felt sorry for their effort in the first part. Everything else was fine and dandy but the rushed ending and the epic scenes from the manga which were removed got me looking for another show.\
That's all there is, folks and I'm signing off.\

    Soul Eater! WHOOT! I bet you'll agree that there's something about this anime that makes it a tad bit different- and maybe, special- than most shonens. \
Story: 8 \
It's really not that bad. This would have gotten a nine, if not for the last episode- which had a good theme, but poor execution. \
Note: Excalibur episodes, I heard, were completely pointless; but since I skipped those (my computer conveniently crashed, you see) I can't really put them in my review 'ere. \
Art: 9\
Quite original. I love their plain and simple character designs- the kids looks like kids, and the adults look like adults. There are\
          \
        also some design flairs that are especially remembrable- like Medusa's and Stein's face expressions, Kid when he's despairing, and Maka's crazyness/anger. Additionally, some lovely abstract terror here and there- the Kishin arc, f'r instance. \
Also, I'm reminded more of standard \"American\" animation here, as it were. (SE is like way better, of course. XD) It just contrasts so much with other animes I've watched, like Death Note and even FMA. So very.. comedic, in a way. \
Sound: 9\
Has two of my favorite OP songs- yep, both first and second. I like how in the beginning things are always moving and basically GOING somewhere. \
Can't really remember the specifics of the background music, but that's a good things 'cos if I do, it probably means it's horrible. So yeah, great complimentary bg music. Rock parts were fantastic. \
Character: 8\
Maka's absolutely kick-ass, and although she's not particularly unique among the throngs of chars she's still a solid rock that moves the story along. Soul is there merely for shipping w/Maka,  of course. :3 Kid's... interesting, provides comedy relief. Shinigami-sama's great. Tsubaki is awesome. Etc, etc..Oh yeah, and Black Star's HILARIOUS. ^^ I swear, he's there just to mock Naruto. \
-backstage whispers- \
Oh, he's not? \
-whispers- \
-shrugs- Oh well, he's still hilarious- or do I mean failarious?\
Note: I was a little easier on character rating here, as this is a lighthearted anime and I'm going with the flow. If it was approaching the seriousness of Death Note, then it'd be different. \
Enjoyment: 9\
Okay, so here's where I'm a bit biased. For some reason this anime just rubbed off like a Terry Pratchett kind of thing- funny, sometimes inappropriately so, of course, but still retains an awesome sense of dark seriousness, depending on where the director wanted it to go. I tend to enjoy animes that take themselves lightly, and feel like the makers are enjoying themselves as well. XD \
Overall: I give this a nine. I was extremely surprised to see it ranked so \"low\"- this was when I first registered on the site- but after the contemplation that there are over 4000 animes, and that, really, most series are not this good, I'm satisfied with its spot (#69, lol).\

    Soul Eater came out at a time, where at the very least for me and were I live, there weren't many action anime that didn't have a really long running time that were airing on TV, with things airing such as Naruto, Bleach, Yuyu Hakusho and Inuyasha. With the examples of good action anime outside of TV being also long running series such as DBZ and One Piece, a series having over 100 episodes was a set standard for me. Despite it not being actually short and having 51 episodes, that's how I have seen Soul Eater and this is kinda how it caught my\
          \
        attention when I picked up to finish what I watched on TV. At that time, I wasn't aware of many action animes that didn't have long running arcs with some fillers and not having the original ending of the manga, so in many aspects, I saw Soul Eater as unique.\
However looking back on it, its story was as generic as it can get. I mean, the world and the means through the characters are designed both visually and in the narrative was indeed interesting, but the story boils down to children hunting monsters with superpowers, in a school setting and its ending pretty much encompasses that courage and determination trumps all. There are some interesting character arcs in there, which aren't exactly something unique, but are certainly noteworthy.\
You see, one of the things that I found interesting about Soul Eater that its introductory episodes each featured a different group of characters in order to introduce their personality, powers and relationship. And it does a good job in doing so, since it helps you understand how each characters have a different view on the world and a different dynamic between each other. It is yet another way it used to differentiate itself from others at the time for me, since most examples that I had in mind at the time only had one protagonist that was the main focus, but this series took its time to present that all the characters were important. In terms of personality they weren't exactly unique however, with 6/7 of them pretty much boiling down to \"hardworking student, cool dude, egotistic kid, kind and adaptable girl, one serious and one goofy twin\". The one 7th character was noteworthy due to the fact he had a personality quirk that was pretty much like OCD, a concept that was new to me at the time, and admired and wanted everything to be symmetrical, as well as this quirk being a metaphor to him wanting order and balance in the world.\
What's interesting in the series is the relationship dynamics created by these teams, since in order for the teams to have their powers working, each member has to have compatible personalities with one another, and trust each other. This creates a focus on character relationships that I didn't really see essential at the time, this further making things more interesting. The prospect of characters getting more powerful the better they understand each other, and that also being a focus point was very interesting at the time. But I don't think there was a lot done with it outside of a few characters. One group got an \"edgy\" powerup (I'll get to edginess later) where they kinda had to get along with eachother to kinda control it, but they didn't really have any noteworthy personality traits to make this significant, the other group of the OCD kid didn't really have too much conflict on their hands. The last group, of the egotistic kid is what was entertaining, as this kid needed to learn how to temper his egocentric nature and also had a nice effect on his partner, giving her more confidence in herself since one of the reason she was she cooperative because she didn't want to be in conflict with other people. Their storylines were executed well and found quite a bit of enjoyment there. Again, I don't think any of this is unique, but there's certainly some good things in the execution of the characters.\
If you were to ask me however what's more memorable, the design of the characters or the events they go through, I'd say in most cases of the characters that weren't a focus point, that while they do overlap, is that the design shines a lot more than the personality of the characters. I'd even go as far as to say that some characters have more of a personality due to their design, with the details put into them signifying exactly what you'd expect by stereotyping the characters. I do think the overall designs are really good though, since the characters of whose personality you know you'd understand why they'd choose to dress a certain way. So this is a two way street.\
In terms of action, it has some good moments, and some interestingly built powers. A lot of it depends on the presentation of the powers, featuring interesting ideas for how the powers of the characters work. There also are some moments where you can admire how the characters strategized and how their powers evolve based on their character arcs, but remember the \"edgy\" I said before. There's this plot thread, of madness, where characters may get a powerup, once they get mad. You see, some characters get more powerful, once they go insane. In those moments the action is kinda dulled, and while it is an important plot thread, there are some things that are dulled by it. And there also are some fights that are merely there to look good.\
In terms of comedy, it's fairly slapstick and generic, while having some character based comedy in it. There's also plenty of comedy that comes from ecchi, tag which is missing from Soul Eater. I'd argue the series is ecchi, since in the first episode, there's a naked cat girl taking a bath and trying to seduce a guy, the second a character tries to peep on naked girls, the third a guy grabs the tits of some girls and etc. A lot more examples exist.\
The series had some good aesthetics, with the designs being memorable and really telling of the personality of the characters, while also looking fairly simplistic, which makes the series more palletable. I also quite enjoyed its OST, having a lot of good sounding songs influenced by hip-hop, and quite a memorable style to it.\
Soul Eater is a series that I will remember fondly due to how different it was at the time, but I will always consider average, due to the fact it didn't really do anything with its strong suits and told a fairly generic message and had a lot of elements that I still find detrimental to a series all in all. I think it's an interesting choice if you want to look at how it differentiates from the big anime formulas at the time, but I can mostly recommend it for research purposes only. I mean, it's a fanservicey show set in a school with some fairly tropey characters and a plot that boils down to a generic message. It is a simple show, maybe you might like it for that factor, that has good execution in a bunch of different areas, but has a pretty overused formula which makes all the things that make it differentiate itself from other shows, on the exact same level.\

    Have you ever wondered, what if there was a show about teenagers where some turn into weapons, and others control them? So, looking at the description and box art and all of that, Soul Eater seems pretty average. And it starts out pretty average. However, as it goes along, the plot develops, and becomes something much better.......\
TSUNAIDA TAMASHII HIRO KIGA. MUE NO SASU KARAAAAA\
After playing the first opening song multiple times, I decided, why not rewatch this amazing series. Then I thought, what if I reviewed it, to possibly get people into it? So I decided to get off of my xbox, get off of\
          \
        Netflix, and write this review.....\
(jk I'm watching it right now XD)\
So the story is about a group of several teenagers who are aiming to become a death scythe. Well, there are weapons, people who can turn into weapons, and meisters, people who can resonate with the soul of weapons and control them. After collecting 99 kishin souls, and after that, a witch soul, the weapon ecomes a death scythe. Sounds typical, right? Well, as the show goes on, it becomes less about becoming a death scythe, and more about connecting together. Just, one major issue is......the ending. It was seriously probably the worst way an anime has ever ended imo. Yes, even worse than fma conquerer of shamballa. Well, moving on...\
The art is very unique, especially the character designs. They are all so different...whether its souls sharp teeth and white hair, makas plain green eyes, or blackstars blue hair, each character gets to stand out. Also I love the art style. Again, its very different. Bones has always been pretty experimental when it comes to art and animation, and this time, it was gr8. Also, the animation is fluid and very good, especially in the action scenes. \
Sound speaking, the soundtrack was very memorable and well done. The opening themes are awesome! In fact, op 1 has to be one of my favorite openings ever. The ending themes were great too. But the voice acting (ENG DUB) was outstanding. Each voice perfectly fits each character. \
This show truly shines with its characters. Bones has always put a lot of their effort into making their characters feel alive and stand out, and in soul eater, it has some of the most memorable characters iv seen in an anime. Whether its the varied and unique designs, the voice acing, or just their personalities, they are very likeable. Crona has some of the best development iv ever seen. So, why am I not giving the character category a full 10?\
You already know why\
You know who I'm talking about....\
EXCALIBUR YOU SON OF A \
Anyway, I had an absolute blast watching soul eater. It has become one of my personal favorites. However, its not a show most will enjoy immediately. It starts out ok, then gets good, then it gets rlly good, then gr8, and then....\
you get hooked XD\
well I honestly didn't get hooked to the series until like episode 6 or 7, but it was worth the wait, because once it gets good, it gets gooooooooood...\
\
Well, itsa bout time for a verdict\

Art: 10\
Animation: 9\
Sound: 9\
Voice Acting: 10\
Characters: 9.5\
Enjoyment: 10\
Overall: 9.50\
My Score: 9.50 (well would ya look at dat!)\
On the positive side:\
The story is developed very well \
The characters all have distinct personalities and stand out. And they all develop\
The art style is AWESOME\
The animation is fluid\
Plenty of enjoyment to be found\
The voice acting is top notch\
On the negative side:\
The first few episodes are mediocre\
The ending sucked\
I want to firkin kill Excalibur (HE WASTED 3 PRECIOUS EPISODES THAT COULDVE BEEN USED TO GIVE THIS SHOW A BETTER ENDING. BUT NOO, EXCALIBUR HAD TO SCREW IT UP. WELL SCREW YOU, EXCALIBUR!!!!)\
Even with Excalibur, even if the ending sucked, even if the first few eps aren't gr8, can that stop me from loving this amazing show? No, not at all\

Now I just gotta watch soul eater NOT!......\

    After watching this show from start to finish roughly 5 times, here is my review of it. Soul Eater is in my top 5 best anime. If you can make it through the first 3 episodes this show is worth your time.\
Story: Weapons and Miesters must collect 99 kieshen souls and a witch soul to become a death scythe. Basic premise but much more happens.\
Art/Sound: This show might seem kiddy/PG rated. But it is full of action and a some blood/gore. But what is more impressive is the sound track to this anime. This is also one of the few shows I love watching and\
          \
        listening to the intro to.\
Characters: As I said, make it through the first 3 episodes and this show grows on you. The characters are thoroughly developed on both sides as far as the heroes and villains. When first watching it, Black Star and Death the Kid seem annoying as hell but after awhile they both begin to grow on you.\
Enjoyment/Overall: After 5 times of watching this show, it is one of my favorites that I love to rewatch. English dubbed, this is one of the best. The show is hilarious and full of action. One of the best done shows that I have watched and I am currently rewatching it. This is a must see for anyone that enjoys anime. \

    Soul Eater has everything I look for when I watch a longer anime; humor, action, a relatable character, and some cool looking demons sprinkled in. While watching this I don't think I was ever bored, and that's saying a lot. Even in the slow parts you are still able to laugh as you obtain understanding of one of the characters, and by the end of the anime you want more. Soul Eater has to be, by far, one of my favorite animes and a must watch.\

    !!! KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW !!\
STORY:\
Soul Eater, is based off of the manga by the same name, by Atsushi Ohkubo. The anime follows the manga pretty well, until the Operation Capture Baba Yaga Castle arc, where it differs. The anime does an okay job at creating it's own story-line, but it falls flat on it's face toward the end. I just couldn't enjoy the final battle in the anime, like I did in the manga. It was too...cheesy. I actually had to look up the ending on Youtube after the fact, because I actually quit out of the video, after Maka's\
          \
        final \"attack,\" on Asura. \
ART:\
The art was weird looking at first, but quickly got better as the anime progressed.\
SOUND:\
Oh god, the music. The first opening theme, \"Resonance,\" was stuck in my head for weeks, due to it's upbeat rhythm, the battle music isn't too shabby, and the second opening theme is perfect for the tone of the second-half of the series. As for the ending themes, they're pretty enjoyable. \
CHARACTERS:\
The anime, due to splitting from the manga, wasn't able to capture the more mature, selfless side of the characters you see later in the manga. For example, Black*Star. In the anime, even after fighting Mifune, he still remained an irritating, selfish, brat who only thirsts for power, and to surpass God. He did grow up a little bit, when it came to controlling his Shadow Blade, though.\
ENJOYMENT:\
It was  a pretty fun ride, but like most good things, it had to come to an end. As stated before, for me, it was during the final battle. Until that, however, I was content, even with the \"filler\" story-line, and nothing really bothered me(besides those stupid Excalibur episodes. >.< The only thing enjoyable about those, was the faces the people made when dealing with him). \
OVERALL:\
I do recommend this anime, though I also recommend you read the manga first, due to numerous differences. It's a pretty enjoyable anime, giving you those moments when you want to punch the characters in the face, those when you want to cry, those when you want to laugh, and those that make you just...feel good on the inside. \

    Soul eater is a great anime it focuses around 11 characters who are split up into weapons and meisters the groups are maka albarn and soul evans, black star and Tsubaki, death the kid with two weapons liz and patty Thompson. As well as these 7 characters 4 characters are also important to the story who are lord death (the grim reaper), medusa, franken stein and crona \
the main goal for the meisters is to defeat and feed to their weapons 99 evil souls and 1 witch soul (198 souls and 2 witches souls for kid due to him having two weapon partners) but the\
          \
        story is much more complex then that including the mysterious black blood, a spider witch, secret magic tools and much much more. \
I absolutely loved this anime and is my favourite of all time I don't know if you'll like it as much but it is something absolutely worth checking out \
thanks, Ben\

    Upon editing this review, I do believe that everyone in the Soul Eater Fandom would agree with me as I give this anime, the best review that I have ever written! After all, this is my favorite series. \
If I were a dog, I would most certainly wag my tail in a million times just by hearing the word “Soul Eater”. I was really happy when this series turned out to be a successful one and I was really blissful when it came out. I first watched this series last 2010 and this twenty-fourteen, I decided to re-watch it and study its flaws, the flow\
          \
        of the story, the magnificent art, dashing music and sound effects, and last the personalities of the characters. \
The story settles a life of students occupying their time in a glamorous, creepy and huge school for meisters and weapons. I will not explain how and what are meisters and weapons because I believe that you might as well watch SE in order to have the answer you’re looking for. The plot progresses from collecting witch souls to defeating evil villains with supernatural powers. Mainly, I would give the synopsis a score of 9 because it depicts a simple plot with some complicated add-ups or fillers that normally does not count as helpful for the story. Nevertheless, I promise you that this anime labels as “AWESOME” and “FUNNY” altogether. It may have a not-so-complicated plot but I know that you guys will be able to fit in with Soul Eater. It is a story about friendship, strength and believing in one self’s capabilities.\
The music of Soul Eater has quite potential. I give a score of 9 for it has an upbeat tempo for its first song, “Resonance” and the second song “Papermoon” has a more dramatic tone to it. “I wanna be” states a more rock ‘n roll theme and “Style” has a more pop and easy rhythm. Other songs are familiar as well but in my opinion, these four songs have more prospective and are far more enthusiastic to hear. For the repeat show songs, I am fond of hearing “Ao no Kaori” because it has a sad piano background (plus it has a SOMA moment) and also \"Ai ga Hoshii yo\" for its happy tone and includes the cast’s beautiful entrance. The other songs were also worth listening to. Character songs are also presented (see in youtube for more details).  As for the sound effects, it has memorable tunes for each and every character. You can hear piano, jazz themes, creepy sounds, and also fast and upbeat tempo for fighting scenes. The Japanese dub was amazing. Miyano Mamoru did a fabulous job for Death the Kid, you have to give props to him for transforming voices ranging from an emotional DTK to a serious and far more manly DTK. Hands down to Black Star’s Seiyuu, Kobayashi Yumiko for a great job in making an arrogant, loud and high-pitched ninja voice. Two thumbs for Uchiyama Kouki, for delivering a cool and sensible voice for Soul Eater Evans. The rest of the Seiyuus stand out too but I think I’ll give notice for Maka’s voice actor, Chiaki Omigawa. I think she needs more emotion because the English voice actor, Laura Baily did an excellent job in portraying Soul Eater’s bookworm.\
The graphics have an artsy look for the series. It fits perfectly because it has dark lines that give a very gloomy accent to the drawings. I had doubts at first because I think the art resembles One Piece and this the only reason why I was reluctant to watch Soul Eater in the first place (I’m so stupid). But with a few push and curiosity, I eventually had the guts to watch it and I fell in love with the series more and more. The eyes of the characters were a bit simple but at least it wasn’t too big and scary. The costumes were a bit creative and stylish as well. The hair style and colors were absolute unique to the eye. All in all it has a great style. \
The characters are the strength of this show. You have beautiful and reflective characters that are unlikely to see in other shows. They have the bookworm dash perfect student girl, Maka Albarn, the cool guy with a hidden attitude, Soul Eater Evans, The hyper and strong ninja, Black Star, The nice and calm, Tsubaki Nakatsukasa, the OCD-symmetry obsessed-son of Shinigami, Death The Kid with his partners, Liz and Patty (have a gangster and colorful personalities that will make you funny bones crazy for laughter). The supporting casts are interesting as well: the womanizer father, Spirit, The crazy lab guy who is addicted to experiments, Stein, and more. The antagonists did a perfect job in making watchers feel annoyed and memorable. Medusa and the Kishin were the best villains that I have ever seen in my entire life. If you want to see how these characters cross roads and make the series brighter than the sun, I really want you to watch this anime.\
Do I need to explain why I enjoyed this show? Soul Eater is frickin’ perfect. The shonen theme plus comedy is wicked and worth watching. It instantly became my favorite show. (yeah sure it had some fan service but it didn't bother me at all) I was blown away by the characters, the music and sound effects plus the running gags throughout the show. I have to say, this show amazed me and I would love to recommend it to anyone even non-Shonen fans. I watched the show numerous times already, purchased merchandise of Soul Eater, became an admin of a page of Soul Eater on facebook, browsing pictures of it, being a fan of its characters and a lot more. Need I say more? I am attached to these series. I had fun watching it. It made me laugh, cry and mesmerized by its contents. I am freakin’ addicted to SE so someone give me a medicine. \
Overall, it may have a lot of bruises and some parts may be fixed like the second half of the show from episode 27 – 51 especially the ending but the show is mind blowing and it has the augmented reality of making people hooked to it. It may have some issues to its originality like the names of the characters being driven from Halloween characters, portraying death reapers like in Bleach and whatsoever, a blue-haired ninja that might imitate, Naruto and others. But I believe this, trust me Soul Eater has a lot more indication. It will conduct a large amount of creativity that no one has ever seen before.  Watch it and you will never regret seeing it for the first, second, third or nth time. I want you guys to experience SE. Please watch it.. Please.  ",

    Soul Eater. I don't even know where to begin...\
Overall, I gave Soul Eater a 10.\
Story - 10: I can't say that I haven't seen animes that don't revolve around the concept of \"souls\", but SE made it interesting in its own little way. And, for me, SE was constantly surprising me, with all the small twists and turns. I could never predict what was going to happen. (Even the ending surprised me!) I love that in animes. :) Also, Soul Eater had a mix of most everything... humor, action, supernatural sort of things, etc. Romance was left out (;n;) but you can use your imagination\
          \
        to picture things going on with the characters. (Plus, who doesn't see the obvious chemistry between Maka and Soul?! They're perfect.) I never got bored watching this. \
Art - 9:  I think I'm a little too forgiving for this whole reviewing thing, but I really, really loved the art in Soul Eater. The characters are sort of average, but backgrounds, buildings, and most scenes were nicely done. I loved the sort of childish feel to Death City. Contradicting, because of its name. I also enjoyed how the sun and the moon weren't important figures, but they were always there... the way they were drawn makes me laugh, now that I look at it. I'm not really sure what could have been changed or added to make this a 10, but, as close as it was to deserving a 10, it wasn't quite there.\
Sound - 10: 10, 10, 10... but the music was pretty much amazing. I adored both openings and all of the endings. I actually never once skipped the openings (which I usually end up doing because I get sick of them), so it came as a surprise to me that I could rewatch the same opening 25 or so times and still bob my head along to the music. I'm pretty sure most fans would also agree with me. :D All of the background music for fights/other dramatic scenes fit them perfectly! It added lots of feeling to the scenes and fit the settings accordingly and everything. \
Characters - 9: Since the main character (of the main pair) was a girl, it surprised me that I didn't get annoyed with her. Usually girl protagonists start to annoy me halfway through any series, but Maka seemed pretty awesome to me (>.> not because she uses a scythe or anything...). The character development was also great. You go on an adventure alongside with them and watch them mature in their own ways. Each character was different from each other, but still learned to all fit and get along. You couldn't honestly dislike any of the characters. (Except the bad guys, but even they're hard to dislike.) The evil characters were perfectly evil, and the good guys were awesome. Once again, I really can't seem to give it a 10, but I still loved everyone in SE.\
Enjoyment - 10: I enjoyed Soul Eater and will probably watch it again, too. (I'm gonna get started on the manga as well, because I honestly cannot get enough.) Soul Eater is highly enjoyable and I really recommend it to anyone.\

At first I told my self that this looked like crap. So I dropped it on the first Episode. 6 months later I decided to watch it again, and boy was I wrong.\
\
One big negative I have with the story, is that it takes so long to get into. The first 12 Episodes were boring, but It was still interesting me. The 13th Episode is what really got me hooked. That scene with Black Star was so touching. And after that Episode I went to Best Buy and I bought\
          \
        The Complete series of Soul Eater. I marathon Soul Eater in 2 nights and I didn't leave my room, lol I was like a vampire when I saw the sun. \
The art is absolutely amazing! The way the sun & moon looked were creepy but it fit right into the story. Not just that, I loved how everything looked like Halloween. \
\
There where times when I just didn't like the music. I thought it was dull. It threw me off at times because it felt like elevator music. But when the music starts to play when a fight starts or something exciting happens then it gets epic were I am about to lose control. \
I love all the characters! The character design and character development were amazing! Hands down the best character development was Crona.\
dealing with some much BS, he/she decided to turn good and make his own decisions, what is right and what is wrong. And the best character design I have ever seen is Franken. That dude look like Frankenstein, but only in an anime version.\
Overall I give Soul Eater a 9/10. ",

Its not a anime that you watch on a weekend, it took me about 2 months to watch. I admit, the prologue seems a little boring, but after that, its super funny. Ignore the hate and give it a try.

    Soul Eater, while one of the lesser known series, is generally a good one to view. The plot is amazing, and original, as far as I can tell, and the cast of characters are lovable. Soul Eater can get serious, but at the same time, humor is added in there, and you can't help but crack a smile at it, especially whenever Death the Kid freaks out due to his obsession with symmetry.\
I liked this series mostly for the characters, but I also liked it because of the plot line. I tend to like series with \"original\" plot lines since they don't seem to be\
          \
        recycled from another series. I loved the opening and ending themes, my favorite opening being \"Resonance\", and my favorite ending themes being \"Style\" and \"STRENGTH\". \
Soul Eater has become a big favorite for me, being second on my top five series. The ending disappointed me slightly, but I got over it, realizing that it had to end SOMEWHERE, so the ending was understandable afterward. \
I give this series a ten out of ten. c:\

    I enjoyed Soul Eater and it was maybe the third anime I've watched. This anime certainly isn't for every one, well in my opinion not everyone can like the same anime and that won't ever happen. It took me about a month to watch Soul Eater but only because I had other things to do.\
.:STORY:.\
I would give the story a 9.5. Don't be discouraged after the fist few episode that this is a plotless anime. It isn't, the first three episodes is just the prologue for the main characters, then after that you have a few side plots until around episode 20 (or around there)\
          \
        that's when the real story begins to pick up.\
.:ART:.\
I personally thought he art was very well done, the animation itself had very few flaws, the battles were exceptionally great and as far as I'm concerned no scene from this anime was totally blown-off. I think it deserves a solid 9!\
.:SOUND:.\
Sound was pretty well done throughout the series. I loved some of the OST's I give sound an 8.5\
.:CHARACTER:.\
Has to be one of the best part of this anime. With the main characters and there major differences I just love how they can all fit together. The characters fit along perfectly with the anime and I would never be disappointed by them.\
.:ENJOYMENT:.\
I enjoyed Soul Eater, I've actually seen it twice now, the first time I watched it I loved it. Afterwards I watched some amv's from YouTube, one in particular made a thought occur in my head, the amv is called This is Halloween. It made me realize how dark this anime really is.\
.:OVERALL:.\
Overall I mist say Soul Eater deserves a 9, great story, amazing characters, very enjoyable, I plan on rewatching Soul Eater again in the future!",

    Soul Eater is definitely one of these anime that one will most definitely re-watch immediately after one has finished the series the first time around.\
In a world where certain people,called Kishin Eggs,have gone wrong and have started killing humans in order to eat their souls and gain more power,there has been established an academy known as the Shibusen,where people called meisters partner with spirits know as weapons to defeat the Kishin Eggs and save mankind.\
The story focuses on 3 pairs of meisters and weapons,Albarn Maka & ''Soul Eater'' Evans,Black Star and Nakatsukasa Tsubaki and Death the Kid along with twin sisters Patty & Patricia Thomson\
          \
        respectively... \
Breaking-down of my ratings : \
Story : 9\
While the ending could have been a little more satisfying,the series,being a 51-episode one,delivers an amazing blending of Drama,Action,Mystery,Comedy and Supernatural.\
Art : 10\
The visual imagery aspect of the show is stunning.Attention to detail prevails and the results are the best I've seen so far in a prior to 2010 anime.\
Sound : 10\
It's simple;The Soul Eater soundtrack is the only OST I ever bought in my life.\
Character : 10\
While the show has a positively complex set of side stories along with a main storyline,the character development is efficient,thus leaving no background blanks as far as the main characters' back-story is concerned,while the lack of informing on certain supporting characters' lives gives off a charming sense of mystery to the show.\
Enjoyment : 10\
This is one of the few shows that hadn't have me yawning while watching it.Being at the edge of my seat throughout the entire show made me want to recommend it to people,since you cannot just ignore a show of such fine quality.\
Overall : 10\
I think I have provided sufficient information as to why I have been led to rate this show with a rare-for-my-rating-style 10.\

From ep 1 I was absorbed by this anime and its unique style. The artwork is amazing and like nothing you have ever seen before.\
At first you think that this is your typical fighting anime, but soon enough you realize that there is more to the story.\
The story revolves around three main characters and there weapens. The three main characters are students at a weapen school that use their powers to destroy witches and demons, and humans trying to become demons.\

    The premise of Soul Eater is fairly straight forward. New students are inducted into an academy for the sole purpose of being soul reapers. As for the particular genre it falls under, it's a little more difficult to say. Soul Eater has elements of a comedy, drama and typical battle/fighting anime. It's whimsical art style seems to indicate that it could be a comedy, particularly the character designs of Death and Excalibur. As a drama, the relationships between Maka and Soul as well as Maka and Chrona could also be explored in a more meaningful way. Finally, the student soul reapers have been shown to\
          \
        have a multitude of fighting techniques though this is not developed very well. \
Soul Eater appears to have potential to be a greatly entertaining title. However, it's direction takes it from one spectrum to another in a rather distasteful manner. By spreading itself too thin, it cannot be enjoyed to the fullest. Those looking for comedy will lose interest during the fight scenes and vice versa. \
The focus of the characters seems to be off kilter as well. While Maka Albarn is the main character, she gets significantly less air time than the other students until much later in the series. Black Star, Kid and even Excalibur are more memorable characters and make better use of their time than Maka. Finally, when she is the main focus, I find her annoying and boring in comparison. \

    Soul Eater is the best anime EVERRRRR!!!!! ...BlackStar quote \
Seriously though this show blew my freaking mind. I loved every minute of it. A shorter series but I think really had a lot of content to it. My only wish is that they had enough money to make the anime longer and follow the Manga all the way up until recent new releases. Anime ending was abrupt and not as fulfilling as it needed to be but still ended fairly well with the amount of episodes it was given. \
I definitely recommend this show to anyone and will eventually rewatch it soon. \

    Bones &amp; Square Enix have done a great job this time.\
Story: begins with cliches like  'Killing number of monsters = reward', 'protagonist(s) is the only one who can kill the monsters', and 'Characters who questions and/or resolves in-order to become stronger'.\
Though these cliches can be found in almost any action anime Soul Eater stands out by putting the original intention of 'Killing number of monsters = reward' out of the story (or at least short sighting it) and extends into the cliche of 'Stop the bad guys from obtaining certain things in-order to rule the world'. The story shines unlike any other anime when\
          \
        character contradictions, in depth character thought, and secrets come into play. \
Art: The art uses a combination of 'post-gothic' and 'hip-hop' styles. Initially the art doesn't draw attention due to the 'ghetto-ness' of the art that most anime viewers are used to. The art is only acceptable once the other categories of the anime come in. Action scenes are superb but the length of the scenes leaves the viewers wanting more. Certain action scenes lead more to character development verses action itself leading to a 'Naurto-like/Bleach-like feeling', in other words a big disappointment. The anime features 'post-gothic-ness' at certain points leaving a darkened tainted feeling (which is great for catching the viewers mood). When both arts are used in comedy it does the viewer(s) well because of the freshness (like someone hasn't made this joke even though they kinda have and its still funny feeling) it presents.\
Sound: Soul Eater features music that gives off the feeling of 'i want more so im going to buy that damn soundtrack'. the voice actors aren't very renown (though you figure Bones and Square Enix would hire someone like 'oh i know this guy!' kind of guy) but they fill their roles just fine (though some people think Maka/Black Star are annoying). The sound effects are fine and the intro is fine just as well. The only thing that stands out is the in anime music.\
Character: Soul Eater doesn't shy off when it comes to character development. The story goes in dept with what the characters think and makes use of its time. The characters become stronger when they find a resolve which leads to a O_O holy sh!t O_O moment. Characters also contradict themselves which leads to a very human feeling (because we all contradict ourselves at some point).\
Enjoyment: It's great very great just watch the first three and i promise its greatness.\

      Im going to start by saying Soul Eater is very entertaining, theres always something to look forward to and keep your attention grounded.\
 The story:\
 At the start of the series the charactors have a seemingly direct route that you would consider to be the entirety of the anime.Even then i had imagined a wonderous adventure as we followed this lively team on there quest to ultimatly become masters in there feilds, soul a scythe and maka and scythmaster. Thing is the more the story progresses the more the story changes, new problems and obsticals arise and the plot takes a whole new\
          \
        direction, - a very intresting problamatic and intruiging direction - and with the anime growing so much your so intrested in the current that we forget the whole picture, and the original goal. reguardless both directions we intresting and well developed.\
 The art:\
  I love,love loved the visuals of the anime.The movement is fluid and in each of the fighting styles each have there own feel and air about them. The charactors outward apearences give us a peek on there personalities and everyones got there own style.Throughout everything the art always caught my eye.\
The sound:\
 Okay so i dont really know how to review this aspect but the voices and sound effects and emotion behind all the actors really captured you and added to the moment.\
Characters:\
 The entire cast was amazing. Each with there week spots and strengths and Kid is THE BEST! ~(*^o^*)~ okay fangirl moment over but seresly he is. Though excalibur was never a fav i did enjoy his epearences near the end, FOOL! ahahah okay anyway so uhm charactors yeas, they all had there own image, thought proccess and fighting style and despite there contradicting personalities as a team they function suprisingly well -after working out the kinks of course- like a collection of contrasting intruments tuned just right making everything sound perfect.\
Enjoyment:\
 I thouroughly enjoyed the anime A-cuz it was awsome and B-no fillers! need i say more!\
Overall: \
 It was great and even though i dont usually read manga if there isnt a second season im sure ill be heading to the bookstore soon enough.\

The Bottom Line\
- stylistic artwork &amp; characters\
- memorable, in-your-face comedy\
- fluid action animation\
- fun, engaging story (once it picks up)\
\
ASPECT BREAKDOWN:\
Story [8]\
Well executed -- the 1st few episodes are an intro to the artistic, charismatic style of the show and its characters (if you enjoy hyperbolic comedy, you will definitely laugh).\
The grandeur of the plot is exposed gradually overtime. Soul Eater is never boring; the show is very eventful (even in its relaxed moments). This said, there are a small amount of fillers, and though they are creatively setup around a specific character (Excalibur), they do somewhat stunt the potential of\
          \
        the storyline -- however, they are perhaps beneficial to the overall feel of the show.\
I wouldn't say the story is anywhere close to a masterpiece, but it is appropriate in coherence with the other aspects of the show.\
\
Art [10]\
Creative, Smooth, Innovative -- Outstanding.\
Soul Eater incorporates a balanced, colorful animation setup (not too simple, not too intricate). It successfully produces a stylistic atmosphere, which serves to bring out the dark and light moments of the show extremely well.\
\
Sound [9]\
Contemporary soundtrack; parallels the artwork. The BGM always does a fabulous job of adding color to the events taking place.\
OP 2, 'Papermoon' stands out as a fan favorite. Before it became an OP, it was used in episode 28 as BGM to a fight scene, which elevated the scene incredibly well.\
The voice cast does a great job, but their work is nowhere near 10/10 quality. The environmental sound also falls short of 10/10 quality -- though it fits. Soul Eater's music makes up for the slight lacking in these 2 departments.\
\
Character [8]\
The characters are all unique, both in personality and appearance. As you witness their individual qualities throughout the light-hearted and serious moments, you will undoubtedly find yourself a favorite or two.\
The main characters experience a fair amount of growth -- both individually and as a team, which is enjoyable to watch. Some minor characters, however, could use a little more screen time, and aren't explored in too much depth.\

    Recently, I have been looking for some different anime to keep me enjoyed, while make me feel that satisfaction you feel when you watch a good drama. I asked my friends for recommendation, and from those several animes they recommended, I decided to watch Soul Eater. After fifty-one episodes of enjoyment, here I am writing this review. But let me warn you, I am not a really good reviewer, so this review might be deficient or may contain minor spoilers.\
Back to our topic, I want to start with the characters, as I think they are what can make a show really successful, while it can\
          \
        also make it suffer so badly.\
As for Soul Eater, almost every single character was satisfying and their personalities were well crafted, be it villain characters or good guys. Well, there are of course characters I think that should be more featured in the show, but well, it is not that much necessary. Characters, in my opinion, is one of the strong points of the show, Soul Eater.\
Next is the story. Everything started so slow and boring, to tell the truth I don't even remember the first a few episodes. But don't let it bother you, as the main events of the story starts to kick in, it will swallow you, and you will find yourself watching fifteen episodes without realizing. Because the story, with its turn points, great battles and conspiracies, from the moments characters doubt themselves, doubt what they work for, to the moments you scream \"Oh come on you can do it\" or \"Oh my god, he is a total b#stard!!\".\
If you think the story is what makes an anime watchable, Soul Eater will make you watch itself. And don't worry, it has lots of action.\
As for the art style of the anime, I can't say anything was special about it other than it being, well, unique? Soul Eater uses a different approach on visuals than many anime out there has, and even if I said nothing was special about the art style, I believe it is what makes the show what it is. In other words, the visuals fit the story, characters, and the whole show.\
Story, art style, characters, I have covered them all. So what remains is OST, isn't it.\
Soul Eater, to be clear, has a good sound track, which makes many scenes that would be blank without the itself a lot funnier and enjoyable. But if you ask me to point out a sound track that really impressed me, I won't be able to give you an answer. Frankly, there was nothing special with the music used in the whole anime, while the only sound track I really liked was the first opening theme of the show. Also I want to tell that I hated the ending themes, every single one of them. But this is a personal matter, so it might vary from person to person.\
On the overall scale Soul Eater was a really good anime, it gave me a lot of enjoyment almost every single episode, except the first a few episodes and the episodes about the Holy Sword, Excalibur. There were, if I recall correctly, three episodes that featured Excalibur which I think was completely unnecessary, just made for the sole purpose of showing us what is that Excalibur, and prevent us from wondering what the hell is this character when he finally takes part the main plot. I believe there were better ways to feature him, rather than using plain filler-like episodes that just stand there for some comedy. I am okay with watching one episode completely devoted to an unrelated arc, like like two or three characters just wait there and talk nonsense, but doing this three times, it annoyed me really much that I even skipped most of the last Excalibur arc.\
Putting that aside, Soul Eater is an anime that completely deserves the time you are going to spend watching it, if you are thinking whether should you watch it or not, watch it, you won't regret it.\
Finally, I want to thank to everyone who took their time and read my review. I am most pleased if it was of use.\

Characters has their individuality, of big contrast from one another, reason why there are usually fights around them and engaging conversations, one of the many good factors that make this popular to viewers.\

    The Death Weapon Meister Academy in Death City, Nevada, United States, is a specific school to train humans with the ability to transform themselves into deadly weapons as the ones who wield those weapons. This is the place where Maka, Soul, Black Star, Tsubaki, Death the Kid, Liz and Patty are studying with one same goal: Defeat and absorb the soul of 99 humans that turned into monsters named Kishin and one witch in order to increase drastically the power of the weapon and to become a death scythe.\

    \9Anime Review: Soul Eater\
\9In 2008 Bones Animation Studio released the action-comedy anime known as Soul Eater based on the manga of the same name. The anime received high critical success and appraisal from both veteran fans of the source material and newcomers to the franchise due to its interesting premise, well animated action scenes, and a unique Halloween feel that made dull colors stand out in the odd designs of the world that the series took place in.\
o\9Characters & Synopsis:\
\9The world of Soul Eater takes place in Death City, real world Las Vegas, in an alternate reality our own world. The city is under the\
          \
        protection of Lord Death, and within it he installed the Death Weapon Meister Academy (DWMA) to scout and train teenagers with special abilities that either allows them to transform into weapons or be the meisters or handlers of such weapons. The main purpose of the academy is to create Death Scythes out of the weapon students for Lord Death to use in the future when the world is in peril, and order for a weapon to become a Death Scythe, or a weapon of equal power, it must eat 99 kishin, or corrupted, souls along with the soul of a witch to make a total set of 100 souls. Within the academy we have our group of mix-and-match main cast along with a gigantic yet memorable supporting cast.\
\9In the main cast we have 3 pairings of meisters and weapons. First is Maka Albarn and Soul Evans, the typical pairing of flat-chested bookworm with mister cool guy; although they would seem like an unexpected pairing they work off well one another’s pros and cons and Soul is apparently the only student of the DWMA that is able to transform into the actual weapon of the Lord of Death, a Death Scythe. Next is the rambunctious Black☆Star and the sincere but quiet Demon Blade Tsubaki Nakatsukasa, similar to Maka and Soul Black☆Star and Tsubaki work off one another, especially since Tsubaki is the only person that can stand being around Black☆Star for most of the time. And finally we have the Brooklyn raised Olsen Twins Patty and Liz that become the Double Team Demon Guns to the fan-favorite, son of Lord Death, and symmetry obsessed Death the Kid.\
\9Other noteworthy characters include Lord Death himself, Spirit Albarn, the Lord Death’s current Death Scythe and Maka’s father, Blair the Cat, Professor Stein, as his name suggests his obsessed with anatomy and dissecting in particular, Sid the Zombie, a former teacher that got turned into a zombie after his untimely death, the genderless meister known as Crona and his weapon Ragnarok, the iconic, demented, but still likeable witch known as Medusa, and the legendary sword Excalibur, feelings and opinions towards him change from person to person.\
o\9Animation & Soundtrack:\
\9As stated before, Soul Eater was highly appraised for the fluidity and high quality of its actions scenes, but that doesn’t mean that the rest of the series was of any less quality. Whether it was in the complex backgrounds and building designs to the Smiling Sun and Bloody Moon, everything in Soul Eater was made with the finest detail without diverging too much from the original source design. Something noteworthy to mention is the Halloween vibe the whole series gives off, whether it comes from the colors, the character’s designs, all of which look like they are ready to go to a costume party, or the contrasts of lights and darks it makes the anime feel a lot more alive and almost as if one was walking and living inside of the anime instead of being a simple onlooker behind a screen.\
\9As for the soundtrack, nothing much could be said except that the music fits well with the tone of the moment, nothing more nothing less. Whether you decide to go subbed or dubbed you can’t really go wrong as Funimation did a near perfect dubbing for the series, I say near perfect because the voice actress picked for Black☆Star wasn’t that great but that’s just my opinion. One final note about the soundtrack will be the extremely famous openings, which are known to almost any anime watcher, first is T.M Revolution’s Resonance a strong-voice paired with a great use of guitars and drums all of which are combined to a pumping opening that prepared you for the anime you were about to watch and easily to pull you through a trip to the gym. The second opening is softer voiced with Tommy Heavenly6 taking center stage with the song Papermoon, similar to Resonance, Papermoon had a good use of strong vocals combined with guitars and drums; which of this openings is better is up to the viewer but I feel like Papermoon is the better song while Resonance is the better fit for the show.\
o\9Final Scores and Opinions:\
\9Whether or not you enjoy Soul Eater is really up to your affection towards action-comedy animes, semi-dark themed series, and whether or not you want to see a shonen anime that actually ends, 51 episodes, but word of advice after watching the anime it’s best to read the manga to receive the ending intended by the original creator.\
As for final scores I give Soul Eater a(n):\
•\9Critical Score: 8.1/10\
•\9Personal Enjoyment: 8.7/10\
•\9Rewatch Value: 3.9/5\
\9Along with the overall recommendation to Watch it Whenever Possible, it’s a great anime and provides many a good laugh and eye candy in the action scenes but the iffy ending and the episode number might make it a bit overwhelming to pick up and watch, although I never regretted it nor do I personally know of anyone who did.\
\9And with that I conclude this review, leave a comment, like, etc and if you feel so inclined tell me of an anime you would like me to review in the future please do. Thank you for your time and have a nice day.",

    Soul Eater is the bomb. No exaggeration.\
I watched Soul Eater on Netflix about a year ago, and boy was it enthralling. This anime will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. I'm not going to summarize the story, as I know that there are summaries that are concise and well-written. Allow me to gush about the good (which there is a plethora of in this show) and the bad (not as common as the former).\
Story:\
The concept of a \"magical\" school is nothing new. I mean, just look at Harry Potter, for Pete's sake. HOWEVER, this anime is nothing like any other magical school\
          \
        show/movie you've previously seen. The story is strong overall, although the anime does deviate from the manga, especially in the final episodes. If you've previously read the manga and haven't yet seen the show, you might be surprised what the creators changed in the anime adaption. This doesn't bother me, though, as I still found the story to be compelling and fresh. But what really complements the story are the characters within it.\
Characters:\
A strong part of Soul Eater is the cast, who are all intriguing ing in their own right. A great thing about the main characters is that they don't fall under the common tropes that many of us are tired of seeing in other anime. They are funny, determined, inspiring, and it is easy to see that they all care for their partners. Maka, our main protagonist, is a round character in that she evolved from unappreciative and solitary to accepting and appreciative. Another notable character is Death the Kid, who at first appears to be a \"don't mess with me\" kind of guy, but in reality, he's just a kid plagued with a bad case of OCD. His father is the actual Death God, so there are high expectations set for him. He learns lessons as well, and grows immensely strong. One character that I could see people not liking is Black Star, a wild child that will run into any given situation without a second thought. I've heard others say that he is a carbon-copy of Naruto from the Naruto franchise, which I disagree with. I'm not sure how to explain it, but both characters are different in their own right; though I do have to agree that they are VERY similar. If you watch the show, you'll know what I'm talking about. There is one scene with all of the main characters where they are all taking a test, and it's probably my #1 favorite scene from any anime ever. The characters have great chemistry with one another, making for a quality show that makes you root for them when they are faced with preeminent danger. Also, look out for Excalibur *shiver.*\
Art:\
Ok, so the art style is a little but weird. It's a reason why so many people drop the show before even finishing episode 1. It is something that you will probably have to get used to, but I actually found myself liking the strange art style. It complemented the setting extremely well, and it also gave the show an original feel. The action scenes, which are fairly common, look great on a screen. Some character designs were a bit over the top, but even still, they represented the characters and the role they played in the story.\
Sound:\
The soundtrack is strong overall. the appropriate tracks are played at the appropriate times. I liked the majority of the songs in Soul Eater, including both openings and a majority of the endings. The only ending song which I was not fond of was the first ending song. Trust me when I say it gets better as the show progresses. I often find myself singing the opening songs, without even realizing it. And for a non-Japanese speaking person, it's quite hilarious to hear my sad attempts to replicate the voices in the songs.\
Soul Eater is one of those rare gems that you could keep watching over and over again. If you have the option to buy it, I really recommend you do that. Please don't let the art style turn you off, as you'd really be missing out in something great!\
Please note: There is quite a bit of violence in Soul Eater, so it may not be appropriate for younger viewers.",

    Overview:\
\"Soul Eater\" is not what I'd call one of my favourite anime, as it has more than its fair share of flaws and to some may come off as just another generic shounen series. Despite this, I found the series to be a very enjoyable experience that is well worth a look, mainly thanks to some great fights and humour, lovable characters and a very interesting and unique premise.\
Story & World (7.5/10):\
\"Soul Eater\" is set in a Hogwarts-esque school known as Death Weapon Meister Academy (DWMA for short) where students are trained to become meisters, warriors who fight and battle evil beings using Demon Weapons,\
          \
        people who are able to transform into traditional weapons such as scythes, swords and guns. The evil beings they fight are in fact humans whose souls have been taken over by what can only be described as pure evil, and can only be destroyed by Demon Weapons. Conveniently, the things they leave behind, known as Kishin Eggs, are used to power Demon Weapons, and once one gathers 99 of them and the soul of a witch they become a Death Scythe, which is best described as the final form of a demon weapon.\
The story revolves around three of these meisters- Maka Albarn, the daughter of the current Death Scythe of DWMA, Black Star, a young boy from an infamous clan of ninjas, and Death the Kid, the symmetry-obsessed son of Lord Death, the headmaster of the DWMA, who all aim to turn their weapons into the next Death Scythe. To some, this could come off as just another collect-them all series. However, it's not long before the truth behind this mysterious evil comes to light, and about halfway through the series the plot has gone in a completely different direction. \
Unfortunately, for quite a while, the plot doesn't go anywhere fast. The series has a bad habit of constantly introducing new villains and not killing off any of them for ages. As a result, when one finally does get killed, they start dropping like flies, which in this case is not a good thing as many of their defeats are highly anticlimactic, and there are quite a few who just disappear never to be seen again. This is especially true for the main villain, who is defeated with one of the most insane pieces of troll logic I have ever seen. Ultimately, a good story with an average ending, especially since at the end they say that things aren't even over. As a result, the story feels incomplete and left me with a sour taste in my mouth.\
Art & Animation (8/10):\
\"Soul Eater\"'s art style is quite unique, but not what I'd call fantastic. Call me old-fashioned, but I generally prefer anime to have a realistic look to them. \"Soul Eater\" just looks plain weird. While some of the environments look good and give the series a dark atmosphere, there are also some that just look ridiculous and nearly ruin some otherwise good scenes. I will say, however, that the fights are very well-animated, with the characters wielding their weapons extremely smoothly.\
Sound & Dialogue (8/10):\
\"Soul Eater\"'s music fits the series quite well, but most of the time it just blends into the background and just goes unnoticed. The two opening themes are fantastic, with the second being my personal favourite of the two. The ending themes also get better with each one; the first is, well, terrible, while the fourth and final one is easily the best of the bunch. The script is generally great, with a great blend of both drama and comedy. Backing this up is some excellent voice acting from a number of well-known actors, including Laura Bailey, Todd Haberkorn, Monica Rial and Vic Mignogna, who provide the voices of Maka, Kid, Tsubaki and Spirit, respectively. Unfortunately, the voice acting is marred somewhat by Brittney Karbowski, whose performance as Black Star ranges from average to terrible.\
Characters (8.5/10):\
The characters are, for the most part, pretty ingenious. Every meister tends to have a partner who makes up for their weaknesses. In fact, the first three episodes are dedicated to introducing the three main teams. Death the Kid is the last of the meisters to be introduced, and a Grim Reaper like his father. While this generally makes him a force to be reckoned with, he has one serious flaw, namely his borderline-insane obsession with symmetry. In his introduction episode, he straight-up abandons his current mission because he has a horrible feeling the painting in his living room is leaning a little bit to the right. No, seriously. And when he gets there, we see that it was just his imagination. Later in the same episode, he is unable to fight his enemy because of its perfect symmetry. Once it reveals its true self, which is very asymmetrical, we see exactly what he's capable of when he goes berserk and blows it to smithereens. Ultimately, his OCD is a pay-off, as without it, he would pretty much annihilate everything in his path. The second of the main meisters is Black Star, a ninja who is said to have a lot of potential. Unfortunately, he is extremely arrogant and doesn't know the first thing about stealth, preferring to charge in like an idiot and make his presence known due to being a massive attention-seeker. His unrelenting arrogance makes him easily my least favourite of the main characters, not helped at all by his aforementioned mediocre voice acting.\
My favourite character by miles, on the other hand, has got to be the main character, Maka. She's kind, smart, funny (I laughed out loud every time she did one of her Maka Chops) and can wield a massive scythe around like it's nobody's business. She's also the only one of the main trio without a specific personality trait holding her back (Kid having his OCD and Black Star having his arrogance). She may not have Black Star's raw strength or the abilities of a Grim Reaper like Death the Kid but she makes up for this by being much smarter than both of them, and so is often able to use her brains alone to defeat enemies they can't due to their recklessness. While she starts off with a bit of a temper (usually brought out by her partner, Soul) by the end of the series, her sweet, gentle side is shown all the time, though it's worth noting that it was already her prominent side to begin with. \
Next up, we have the weapons. Maka's partner, Soul, starts off as more or less the opposite of Maka- arrogant, snarky, careless and laid back. However, he becomes a lot more serious about halfway through the series, and shows time and time again that he will protect Maka no matter what happens to him, not that she's best pleased about this. Tsubaki is Black Star's partner and a ninja herself. Therefore, she can turn into ninja weapons like a kusarigama, a shuriken and a smoke bomb. She's also probably the most kickass of the weapons, and stands out as the only one I prefer to her respective meister, not that that's particularly difficult since her meister is SUCH a pain in the ass! Due to his obsession with symmetry, Kid has not one, but two weapons, namely the Thompson sisters, Liz and Patty. The two are essentially polar opposites- Patty is very cheerful and optimistic, while Liz is very cynical and sarcastic, especially when dealing with Kid's OCD.\
Besides the main characters, there's also the staff of DWMA (including the aforementioned Lord Death and Spirit Albarn) and the large amount of villains. While a lot of the villains tend to be unkillable bastards, that doesn't stop them from being compelling. The main villain is particularly great, being noted by many fans for making the comedy completely stop whenever he's on-screen. It's a real shame his final fight had to end so badly, though.\
Enjoyment (8.5/10):\
\"Soul Eater\" is through and through a very enjoyable series. Despite the story staying in the same place for quite a while, there are always some great battles to keep you entertained and very fun comedic moments, though of course the latter become less frequent in later episodes. While the final battle could definitely have been better, the ones leading up to it (namely, the middle fights) are still great in their own right, though I would certainly wait a while before watching it again.\
Overall:\
All in all, \"Soul Eater\" is a very original, enjoyable experience. It may not be for everyone and the ending is very anticlimactic but the well-animated fights, great characters, truly hilarious comedy and unique premise make this a fantastic anime I definitely don't regret watching in spite of its glaring flaws. Unless you're one of those people who can't stand shounen battle anime, this is a show I absolutely consider worth recommending.\

    After about two months without a review I’ve finally been able to sit through a whole anime and it is none other than that hilarious erotic comedy/romance Soul Eater. Wait, that’s not right…\
Soul Eater is fifty-one episodes of pure good. Never does it amaze and never does the plot really go anywhere exciting, but it is good for what it is and an enjoyable respite from all the other generic shonen crap out there. It is even 94.3ish percent story and 5.7ish percent filler with only three filler episodes, which is a miracle. Of course, this filler will be described below in full. Please enjoy\
          \
        my first review in forever.\
Story\
The plot of Soul Eater revolves around Maka Albarn and Soul Eater. Soul Eater is a weapon, essentially a human that can change into a scythe and Maka is a weapon meister, a fancy German word for master. They go to a school (imagine that) for weapons and meisters run by, who else, but Death himself. In order for a weapon to become a death scythe, it must eat ninety-nine souls and one witches soul. This idea is completely swept under the rug by about episode four and the idea never comes up again. The plot, after introducing us to Maka, Death the Kid, and Black Star (also known as “I wish that guy would shut the hell up”) starts into a story rife with intrigue. A bad witch has infiltrated the DWMA (name of school/organization that Death heads) and is going to awaken the Kishin, a crazy guy who Death defeated eight hundred years before. This Kishin guy will envelope the world in madness and essentially destroy it.\
At first I though “Okay, it’s not that generic, but it’s still not that exciting” and I maintained that feeling all the way through the end. One of the things I was starting to commend at the beginning were the fight scenes that I felt were engaging and didn’t last too long. But as I continued the series I found myself hating the fight scenes. Not that they were bad per se, but they just follow that generic “I found another secret power that trumps the last secret power I found” feel. Even worse are the fights that go nowhere, and these are found throughout (fight with Flea, fight between Justin and the bipedal loggers shed).\
One of the worst parts of the end of the series is the fact that major bad guys are offed in ten seconds. It’s ridiculous the amount of build-up to these climactic battles that is then completely rendered obsolete by a single quick punch that should have been used from the beginning so I wasn’t sitting around hoping for someone to quit getting beat up and start into some epic clash.\
And then there is Arachne. First of all, she comes out of freaking nowhere. Halfway through the anime we are introduced to a bad guy that just shows up like she’s been late to a cocktail party for eight hundred years and coincidentally went the night her drunk sister was violently murdering everyone at the party and the late sister decided to join in on the fun. Her drunk sister who is also eight hundred years old.\
And here’s the kicker that is a major SPOILER! She dies by being punched once by the Kishin at around the very last episode. That’s it! There is all this build up to a fight. Then she never fights anyone, she just stands there and wants a freaking hug from the Kishin, he punches her, and it’s over. THAT’S IT? ALL THIS BUILD UP TO A SINGLE PUNCH FROM A GUY WHO WAS SUPPOSEDLY ON HER SIDE?\
And then the ending! I think I learned something from the ending. Something about that one word that was tossed around more times than there were episodes to the series.\
Oh yeah: “GWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!”\
No, that’s the sound of a character powering up and screaming like a man giving birth to a colony of sea urchins.\
The word is: courage (which coincidentally is the name of the last episode)!\
It was shoved down my throat like I was in some sort of Sunday school or something. “Everybody has courage! Right here!” *Points at heart*. Shut up Maka. Quit trying to cram life lessons down my throat. I watched this to see things die, not get lectured to death by a teenage girl wearing a skirt so short it’s a wonder her panties don’t show every time she takes an inch step.\
Animation\
The animation is…strange. Not strange in any bad way, but it’s just a little different. Characters don’t look particularly good, though I do find that the designs are cool. What I found to be the greatest part of the animation, though, was the oddball scenery. The world of Soul Eater is beautiful. It looks like a new version of Wonderland. Though, I do believe the architect of some of the buildings should be fired.\
Sound\
I had no problems with any of the Japanese voice actors minus the voice actor for Black Star. We’ll talk about that idiot in the next section though. There was also the voice of Excalibur which made me want to hammer icepicks into my eardrums. Otherwise I especially found Death’s voice great.\
The openings are all surprisingly good. I wasn’t impressed with the second ending, but the third was great and the first wasn’t bad either.\
Characters\
Oh boy. I get to violently rant about the characters now. Sounds good, let’s go:\
Maka-Boring and two-dimensional, there is absolutely nothing relatable about her. While I do find her to be a bit of a badass, especially at the end (people who have seen this know which part I’m speaking of), she still gave off the impression of a typical, boring, good-natured nerd.\
Soul-Likeable to a certain extent, though still two dimensional and unrelatable.\
Death the Kid-He’s actually a fairly funny and likeable character.\
Patty and Liz Thompson-They are like Kid, funny and likeable.\
Black Star-He is the worst character in the whole show. He is like Naruto’s annoying brother…eh, that’s a bad analogy. If Naruto and the anti-Christ were to have a baby, it would be Black Star. He’s arguably one of the most annoying characters ever who does absolutely nothing but talk about transcending God while simultaneously being pretty much the most useless of the three main meisters.\
Tsubaki-I liked Tsubaki. She was calm, she was level-headed, and she seemed to be one of the few characters with any sort of common sense. While she did look like she belonged in Naruto, she was probably the coolest of the main characters.\
The other characters are…debatable. Death, Death Scythe, and especially Dr. Stein are all pretty badass. The bad guys are…the opposite really. With the exception of Medusa who I thought was actually pretty cool, the bad guys are all pretty lame. Crona is just a big bag of tears and boring, though I guess I did feel bad for him. Arachne and the Kishin were just not compelling in any way.\
And this section right here is where you’ll find my biggest gripe with the series. There were very few compelling characters. Most were likeable, but they just didn’t come across as anything more then powerful people looking for something else to kill. The few human moments between the characters are usually ruined by Black Star.\
And between the three best characters; Medusa, Tsubaki, and Dr. Stein, it’s hard to truly pick a favorite. I guess Dr. Stein was my favorite.\
Overall\
Soul Eater is a good shounen. When I sit through fifty-one episodes of a show, you know I like it. The problem is in the pay-off and the weak characters. Truthfully, I felt like I had been punched in the scrotum repeatedly after watching the show because of the fact that only three bad guys out of nine are killed. The rest are shown in a beautiful finale where they stand and stare at the sun or sit and let the wind dramatically blow their hair. And out of the three bad guys that die, none of their deaths or fights are seriously that great. Maybe I sound a little sadistic in wanting more violence and more brutal deaths, but I just felt like the pay off wasn’t worth the build up. I don’t understand why the anime doesn’t follow the much more exciting manga.\
Minus the three idiotic Excalibur episodes that are pretty worthless and can make your brain hurt, the series is sometimes fun, sometimes dramatic, but always good. I have a lot of complaints about it, but for what it is, it is entertaining. It’s in no way a masterpiece, but it can be a good distraction from whatever you need to be distracted from.\

    This is going to be a superficial and short review\
Story: Shinigami-like characters with magic and humans transforming into weapons. Protagonists go to school to learn the magic then goes for some missions. In the end, main chars (good) fight the villain/s (of course, the bad ones) and ends with good people winning the fight. Yes, pretty generic and predictable. Interesting and likable powers of which some are very cool.\
Art: Characters' design even the environment including the sun and moon are easily recognizable because of its original art style; the not the most detailed and cartoonish one. After seeing it once, you won't mistake it from\
          \
        another anime. The setting is spooky and Halloween which is actually decent and fits perfectly the anime. \
Sound: Great Op and background themes. Forgot how the endings are. The 2nd op is one of those bad at first but gradually becomes pleasant to listen to.\
Characters: Average, no great developments, just the usual. Every anime tends to have atleast one character; this anime has like 3-4. This is subjective but I think a lot but not the majority agree with me that the supposed to be ‘funny‘ chars in soul eater like black star and FU***** EXCALIBUR are actually annoying + Maka. Though some who are cool and smart chars compensate for the bad ones .\
Overall: It's got ups and downs. I loved some episodes while I absolutely hate the others that I consider so bad that I ask myself why didn't I skip it. Mediocre ending but worth watching. This isn't a masterpiece to be a must watch but it's a good time killer if u don't have any other anime to watch yet.\

    I always get butterflies when ever I say this animes name Soul Eater is one of the most beautiful anime I ever had the chance of watching.\
\
\
Story:\
So many of my friends had told me to watch this, and I was all like is it good one of my friends said, \"Yes go watch it its freaking amazing.\" Then my brother was watching it and he told me that it was good as well so then I was all like, \"What the hell lets freaking do this.\" And hell to the yeah were my friends and brother were right or were they right.\
\
\
Art:\
The art style is\
          \
        just great and I'm no art critic but I gave the art a pretty damn good rating and this anime is just overall, colorful because they did an amazing job with the art for this anime there are plenty of other beautiful anime out there but this one is no. 2 in my 10 most beautiful anime of all time.\
\
\
Sounds:\
FUNimation had a great cast for characters like Todd Haberkorn for instance he played Death The Kid and he was brilliant at it the whole entire cast in my opinion made there characters just explode, what I mean by that is that they   brought them to life and some actors do a really good job at doing that if you really have it in you. The music in this anime hohoho I can say a lot about the music the music in this is unforgettable. I loved it how they changed it up every once in awhile because it can go from spoopy to rock n roll, and some of the songs in there are just songs that will make you smile, and best of all just make you want to dance.\
Characters: \
\
The characters in this show were just awesome I enjoyed Lord Death because he just silly and when ever he is pissed off at Spirit or anybody he'll just reaper chop them, I loved Maka's dad Spirit because he'll have you laughing. I loved Soul because he could be on and off like Ninja Ninja in Afro Samurai but a little more kind a little bit. Blackstar in my opinion he kind of reminds me of myself because I have a lot of energy, some of the other characters as well but those are just some of my favorites.\
\
Conclusion: \
\
In the end Soul Eater is a beautiful anime that I would recommend that for anyone that is looking for something that puts the kick in kick ass. So if you read this go check out Soul Eater right now you won't regret a thing after you are done with this great peace of work.  I might watch Soul Eater Not I'm still thinking about if I should or not because, I'm watching Date A Live and then after that JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and some other things I plan to watch.\

    Would've been a solid 8 if the ending didn't fuck it up. And if the ending didn't fuck it up, would've been a solid 9 if Chrona or whatever that pink haired bitch's name was wasn't so goddamn annoying. The story is cool, the fights are awesome, the protagonists (except Maka) are awesome, the villains are fantastic and the world-building is pretty awesome. It'a a great anime regardless. It continued to be great, but the point at which it slightly faltered first was when the writers decided to make one of the villains a sympathetic character. And then it absolutely fucked up with the ending.\
          \
        Oh my god, the ending is not even BAD. It's just STUPID. Stupider than shit. It doesn't even fit the type of anime that Soul Eater is in the first place.\

    Ever since I finished Soul Eater I've been conflicted on how I feel about the show in its totality. This was a show that I really enjoyed watching; the art work was unique, the musical openings were great, the characters were dynamic, and the story always made me hunger for more. \
After taking some time to ponder on the entirety of the anime and really reflect upon the various elements of the show, I discovered that it was missing some instrumental components that can make a show transcend to greatness.\
I normally don't analyze the art and music in a show but I think those were\
          \
        both key features in Soul Eater. My typical belief is that a show can be great with bad art and music or vice versa so they aren't components that require in depth analysis on a regular basis. Obviously these elements can enhance a show to such an extent that it becomes more memorable or remarkable upon viewing in some circumstances. \
The art style in this show is unique. At first I was a bit fazed by the strange art style with the mix of typical animation and CGI but as I continued to watch I found myself enthralled by the styling. The combat scenes were crisp and the characters were designed in such a way as to not just make them unforgettable but to visually highlight their individual personalities and quirks. \
Now, while I didn't overly enjoy the first OST Resonance, I would be remiss in not saying that I was well aware of the song Papermoon before I ever watched Soul Eater. Despite its grammatically awkward mix of English with the Japanese lyrics, this opening song is one of my favorites. While I'm prone to skip the OP for most shows, there was never a chance that I would miss Papermoon which remains one of my favorite anime OPs. \
My reflections upon the show led me to the conclusion that what prevented Soul Eater from retaining the initial captivation that I had for it was the story. Upon watching Soul Eater, you should be immediately reminded of another eerily similar and popular Shounen, Bleach. The show's premise is presented in a very analogous manner where the heroes fight against those with corrupted souls using specialized weapons, who also happen to be humans, under the guidance of Lord Death, aka the Grim Reaper. Unlike Bleach, the production team decided not to insert several seasons of filler material interspersed throughout the main story in a nonsensical way. \
The story starts out in a fascinating way in that meisters with their human partners that have the ability to transform into weapons must collect 99 corrupted souls and afterwards a witch's soul to transform the weapon into a Death Scythe capable of being used by Lord Death. This concept could have made for a really intriguing story but it never leads anywhere and is quickly forgotten when more serious issues crop up.\
There are also numerous questions that arise throughout the anime that are never really resolved during the story. The main question that I had, which I feared I had missed the answer to at some point, was what are meisters and weapons? Apparently this question is never answered during the show (there is more expository in Soul Eater Not but I don't recommend watching that). \
In the end the story suffers from several major flaws. The show doesn't cover the entire Manga which means that unresolved issues might be answered at a later time but not within the period covered in the anime. Second, as a Shounen, it's going to focus on particular generic elements geared towards its demographic audience meaning that if you expected Full Metal Alchemist, you might want to look elsewhere. The story is going to cover the typical trials and tribulations of young heroes fighting enemies and overcoming obstacles despite the odds. \
There are certainly some strengths to the story as it reminds us that everyone is vulnerable to evil, darkness, and madness. That good people can commit crimes but still redeem themselves. But the greatest strength of the story is in fact providing a path for the growth of the characters.\
At the end of the day, the strongest aspect of Soul Eater is in fact the characters. The main characters of Maka and her weapon Soul, Black☆Star and his weapon Tsubaki, and Death the Kid and his dual weapons Liz and Patty are all uniquely amazing. It's rare to find shows in which the characters clearly progress throughout the story but this show provided us that rare glimpse in which we saw all the main characters progress from beginning to end. I found that my favorite character by far was Maka (no, I did not find her voice annoying. Apparently, I didn't watch the version that turned her into Asta). While I didn't necessarily appreciate some of her violent tsundere habits, her growth from a perfectionist and model student trying to live up to her mother's reputation to becoming a team player willing to sacrifice herself for her partner was beautiful. The relationship between her and Soul was exceptionally dynamic. Introduced to us as the model student and the cool punk who constantly argued and fought, we saw them grow into a formidable force as they came to truly trust and care for one another where the meaning of soul resonance became clear. I admittedly didn't like Black☆Star for a lot of the anime as he was basically another cocky Naruto, the interactions with his polar opposite in Tsubaki is what made him so unique. While he was loud, determined, and arrogant, Tsubaki was anything but. To see them truly bond and blend was great. I also didn't like Kid at the beginning as his OCD with symmetry drove me crazy but as we saw him change from the dutiful son who had abilities beyond all others to the suspicious detective who thought that his father may have been corrupted to discovering that despite his own suspicions, his father had no evil designs and deeply loved him was remarkable.\
Even outside the main characters, there were several very well developed side characters. Frankenstein whose grip on sanity was a constant throughout the show as his thoughts constantly weighed on his consciousness as he attempted to balance his inner desires with what was right; Medusa who in one instance could go from the kind and caring mother-like figure to contorting her face as she blithely reveled in her wickedness; and Chrona who never could find out who he was or where he fit in. Even Excalibur whose scenes were likely filler provided significant entertainment and laughter as he regaled our heroes in nonsense. Fool! \
I will say one more thing about Soul Eater...the ending was one of the worst I have ever seen and I think that's what caused my initial confliction. I won't spoil it but the ending breaks all the themes pushed throughout the show to prove that any story or plot can be overcome with a studio's direction.\
Nonetheless, Soul Eater is a good show with great art, music, and awesome characters but would have been even better with an improved story. \

Soul Eater starts off with a simple story with a funny atmosphere & comical world setting...but then again after few episodes the story develops into something more deeper & interesting..the story is very enjoybale from all aspects,not too complicated,not too dramatic but just enough to keep you genuinely entertained throughout the whole anime.\
Every character is this story is very well written,impressive & attractive in both looks & character traits,their characteristics,costume design suits them perfectly...There's also decent character development troughout the whole story too.\
The most important part of a Shounen/Action based anime is the 'Shounen' part & Soul Eater\
          \
        executed that part perfectly...Cool & intense action scenes,driven by strategic & fightning style that makes this anime very enjoyable indeed.\
The soundtracks were damn good in this anime too...every soundtracks played during various kind of scenes were perfect & suitable so that everyone can enjoy the anime wholeheartedly.\
Soul Eater is made by none other than \"Bones\" Studio,so obviously you can expect top notch action scenes with great animation & Artstyle..The artstyle of this anime is a bit different & drawn in a comedic way..But It's very amusing,brilliant & beautifully done.\
All in all,this is a really amazing anime that shounen lovers can undoubtedly enjoy.\

The plot isn't the greatest out there but the characters no doubt make up for it\
The only problem i have found with it is that it never followed the manga so we never actually got to see Soul become a death weapon and anyone who has read it\

    This was one of the most unique series I've watched, if not THE most. Every aspect of it has uniqueness, be it art or story or characters. There is a lot of humour, which never feels like an annoyance, even in serious scenes. \
Although there were quite a few loose ends or stories that were left without any development (like Magic Eye Free. Honestly I would have liked further details on the Eight Guardians of Death, Eibon etc but that's too much to ask), they did not really annoy me to a great extent. However, the last episode - that is, how it all ends\
          \
        - REALLY REALLY annoys me. \
\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~SPOILER ALERT~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
\
1. The blow from Asura to Death could easily have been avoided by a man of his calibre. No matter how much you tell me it was a last resort and he didn't have time, come one we're talking about Death here. He could easily have put up at least a weak barrier. The scene happened to move the story on to its final script but this was the first undoing.\
2. Asura initially seems like an exceptional character, filled with madness. However, once he enters his barrier and starts fighting, his character changes. \
3. The words \"I'm relieved\" that Maka utters. Yes, it succeeds in scaring the crap out of Asura, agreed. But it makes absolutely no sense why she would say that at that point of time. If it was a resort aimed at invoking fear, it could only have been seen as such. It wouldn't have succeeded in scaring him. Or, if it was actually her relief, it couldn't have been because literally nothing happens before that for her to be relieved. This was another annoying block in the gears of this anime. They just wanted to defeat Asura using Maka's bravery but they failed in finding a proper script for that.\
4. The final punch that defeats Asura. I get that he was frightened by the bravery, but what actually deals the finishing blow and breaks his mask and face, is the punch. There even was no bravery involved. This was in my opinion the writers relying too much on the bravery concept. They could at least have made Asura's defeat a bit believable. The way they did this was even worse than the cliche \"I need to protect my friends\"-shounen-powerup style. Way worse. This just made me scoff at Maka. \
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~END OF SPOILER~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
As evident, the last episode riled me up bad. The ending could have been so much better. They messed up.\
However, the anime as such still remains really excellent. This was very enjoyable for me. I would really like rewatching this too. But it would be nice if there was a sequel or something that tied up loose ends, developed underdeveloped plots more and just gave us more story.\

    Its a good anime, with outstanding animation , funny moments , cool battles and a good plot,actually it was really cool to see black star getting stronger and their family story, Kid and Stein were cool al the time so they didnt need to train.\
The anime was making the things rightly BUT all that ends in the episode 25-28 (blackstar vs mifune was the last thing i enjoyed).\
The second half is boring, its just see the same jokes , the same fights and the characters dont get stronger at all\
Then we have the fillers and the anime alternative ending, it was so BAD!!!!\

    Story:\
At first glance u will think this is just another shonen series but its quite different. Its about meisters and their human weapons who want to become a Death Scythe. In order to do that u have to collect 99 normal souls and the 100th must be the soul of a witch. This all takes place in a wonderful town called Death City. \
Art:\
I have to say the art was quite good, many many coulours, it felt refreshing. It was nicely animated.\
Sound: \
Soul eater contains some nice soundtracks, they perfectly fit in the series. I especially love the first opening (resonance). \
Character:\
This is why i\
          \
        loved soul eater so much. It contains some great characters:\
For example Death the kid, his father and Excalibur, they are so damn funny that I kept watching it. The kids obsession for symmetry is sometime effecting his fights, thats also quite funny. Soul eater has got great characters but it also has some annoying characters like chrona who started to annoy me after some time but thats just my opinion.\
Enjoyment:\
I really enjoyed the first part of the series, but after some time the anime doesnt follow the manga anymore so it isnt that great anymore. There are still some great fights in the second part but it isnt as great as in the first part. I also disliked the ending, that sucked like hell.\
Overall:\
Soul eater is a really funny anime with great characters and a lot of fighting. \"The first part of the series is a must see I think, but i guess some other people like the second part 2. Still, it deserves an 8.\

    The story is pretty simple and one can easily guess wat will happen in the end but this anime's strong point is the way it takes you from the beginning to the end. There a lot of interesting character and all of them are very well developed so you will never feel that something is out of place at any point. Main characters are very lively and each have their own dreams, destinities, likes, dislikes.\
The comedy is only reason why i thought of giving this anime a try after I saw the first episode. Seriously, people, the comedy is soooooo damn funny!! Each character has\
          \
        their own way of making u laugh. They kick off the first episode with a really tight gag. The ending and middle parts also contain little tidbits to keep u laughing.\
Finally, the soundtrack is extremely well-suited to the anime, u get the right music at the right moment. Also, each character has their own theme songs which are really catchy and match them perfectly.\
However, anime stops at ep 51 when it cud have gone longer (manga still ongoing). The ending gave me a let-down feeling because it was really really mushy. They might had have pulled off a better job with the filler ending but i think they got sloppy in the last episode.\
Overall, I wud like to say that if u r a fan of action,adventure,comedy,supernatural anime, then this anime is a must-watch for you !!!\

    Soul Eater began as a very impressive and engaging anime that had a lot to offer. The pleasant mix of comedy, action and character development made it something easy to watch, as well as enjoyable. Sadly though, the experience pummels by the 25th (Estimated) episode.\
The first half of Soul Eater is fun and enjoyable to watch. The characters are presented seriously as well as playfully. As the series moved on, the comedy lessened and the seriousness began. In the episodes later on as it got more serious, I lost interest. The story started to progressively get slower and slower (not DBZ slow, but slow). It\
          \
        started as a great mythology, but then started to be a story that seemed to be a mix of being too slow or being too rushed.\
It's been over a year since I watched a Soul Eater episode and I left off on episode 34 (I haven't updated my lists in awhile... AWHILE) and I remember not even caring what happens.\
Overall experience of Soul Eater is a great one. I wouldn't highly recommend it, but it is definitely something anyone can enjoy. I was just bothered by the pace change in the later episodes, but I am sure that doesn't bother most. If you're looking for a 'FMA' type series where the comedy and action is well mixed, then start here. You'll get some of what you want.\

Story 9/10: \
The story starts out as A soul and it's meister prolouge introducing them one by one in all 3 episodes while acknowleging the audience there aims and the DWMA achedemy. Once its started you come to know that the story may be predictable, and that may not turn in your favor.  One thing that i respect was that the author kept it to the point, there are almost no fillers - being 51 episodes of entertainment.. only 2-3 episodes of EXCALIBUR that are - well OBNOXIOUS and basically have close to nothing to do with the\
          \
        story. The story keeps you interested with plot, action, suspense and the bonds.\
Art 8/10:\
The art created in mind with Shinigami's - blends in with Characters and the story. And is kept nice and clean according to characteristics of each\
Sound 9/10:\
Again - perfect harmony between the suspense, scenes, character. There was almost no scene which felt outta sync with the scenes proceeding. \
Character 10/10:\
This is the area where the exceptionally shines. The characters are perfect! Maka Alborn pairing with Soul, BlackStar with Tsubaki, Death the Kid with Liz and patty and various other imp characters *cannot spoil*. The people behind the anime have done well keeping the things interesting between characters, carefully making guy-girl Meister and weapon. As the story continues, the charcters are shown to evolve..there's characteristics, emotions, thinking, traits. And in a way you'd prolly like..\
Enjoyment 9/10:\
Shinigami is not a new idea to make an anime with, reguardless the enjoyment feels are likely to kept on middle highs - high. With the great job done with the art, story, sound and characters, everything seems like it's in perfect sync. There is less likely to be any moment that would lose the audience interest, besides minor excalibur episodes ofcourse. The anime keeps it close to the genre and delivers what it wanted to.\
Overall 9/10:\
This gets a 9, for being to the point for enjoyment, interesting story, suspense, action, sound, blendingly well - interesting characters being well synced. \

    Ah, Soul Eater. Even though it doesn't get a full 10/10 from me, I still consider it to be one of my absolute favorite animes I've ever watched. I stumbled across it very late one night in it's first couple weeks on Toonami, and well... within four days I had finished both the anime and caught up with the manga. No joke.\
Art: 9\
The art in the anime was so popular with fans when it originally aired that the manga's art actually shifted more towards the anime's. Everything is sharp, flashy, yet pleasantly cartoonish. All of the background settings are acute to detail (no stone left\
          \
        out of place at the Academy where most of the story takes place) and the characters - Asura, the main antagonist, for example - are well-animated and have an appearance that fit their persona. The fight scenes are also some of the best fight scenes you can find in an anime.\
Sound: 8\
The opening theme from the first two half-seasons \"Resonance\" and the opening from the second half-seasons \"Paper Moon\" are both catchy and fit the mood of the anime very well. In the recent reairings the show has had a new theme set to \"Ai Ga Hoshii Yo\" which I love and has a little more upbeat sense than the other two. The music in the show is a little limited and can be simplistic in nature at times, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Overall, not bad.\
Character: 10\
The characters in this show are really what set it apart. There is one exception - I really don't like Black*Star, even towards the end of the anime - but that's sort of the point, he's comic relief if nothing more. However, the rest of the characters become super easy to relate to or understand, or are never an unwelcome sight if they're mostly comic relief. They all follow one defining characteristic, and follow it to excessive amounts sometimes, but their interactions with others and themselves about those characteristics or other situations turns into something really unique and special for the anime.\
Story: 6\
This is the Achilles' heel of Soul Eater. Due to funding issues the anime had to diverge from the storyline of the manga and wrap up within about 15 episodes. As a result, all of the loose ends created in the first 35ish episodes are pulled together very quickly and done in a rather sloppy way. The story becomes full of plot holes, overly convenient character placement, and a weak ending. I applaud the studio's attempt in at least making the ending coherent, but it doesn't change the fact that the last 4-5 episodes are childish compared to the rest of the series and disappointing. You'll also find yourself disappointed if you like to ship characters, as no relationships are formed whatsoever.\
Regardless of any of this, Soul Eater is a must-see for anyone who's into action/comedy anime with one of the most memorable group of characters you could find. Finishing this review makes me want to go re-watch some episodes (again) myself.\

        Since there are already so many reviews, I will keep mine short and sweet and say why this is one of the few animes I can't seem to get myself to finish. Overall it's your basic shounen anime with a bit of a unique art style.  I had no problem with the action or the music either, in fact that the over the top action which is obviously very common for this type of anime was the best part of it.  But I just couldn't stand the constant \"comedy\" and humor in the show. The main characters were RARELY\
          \
        ever serious which I found more annoying than funny.  IMO, if they just toned down the parodies and humor a bit this show would have been so much more enjoyable but the comedy aspect of this show really takes away from this series.  It's sad because I really want to like this series, I just can't force myself to.  :(\

    I am barely rating this anime because I barely watched it. I'm sure this might be a good anime to some people but not for me. If you like animes that are pretty werid and kind of creepy with some comedy this is the anime for you. But if you aren't used to...how shall I say it....strange animes...then I highly recommend you don't watch this. When I first saw it I thought maybe it won't be as weird as it looks, IT IS. So shoujo and romance anime lovers, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. This anime I think will later include a little bit of\

        romance but it's definetely not it's main target.  So anyways, hope this helps.\

    SOUL EATER is one of the best SHONEN anime around. It'S funny, cool, and doesnt get too serious and let it's flaws damage the series.\
STORY (8)\
Looking back not much had happened but there is plot and it get's better in the manga. Hopefully it'll get a second series like FMA: Brotherhood and it's true greatneess will shine. Still this show is amazing.\
ART (8)\
Not for everyone. It might come off ugly at first but you learn to appreciate it. The backgrounds are fantastic if you know what I'm referring to.\
SOUND (10)\
Masterpiece soundtrack. Taku Iwasaki gives the show rap,metal, and even JAZZ. REALLY GOOD JAZZ.  T.M.\
          \
        Revolution does the first opening and it's a really exciting song. The second opening by Tommy Heavenly6 presents the show in a darker theme and boy does it work. The endings are all different. Ending #1 is upbeat and motivating, #2 is soothing and sweet, #3 is upbeat but in a different way from the first, and #4 is dark yet mesmerizing.\
CHARACTER (10)\
God complexes, Obsessive compulsive disorders, and daddy issues all collide in this wack cast. Crazy and funny people galore. All the types of characters you can like.\
ENJOYMENT (8)\
I must admit I went \"meh\" at first but when I finally settled in I had fun. I got excited for each episode and the rewacth value is high in this show.\

    Soul Eater was a good show to begin with, it was funny, the characters were entertaining the plot was nice etc. but that was only until episode 25 or 30 \
then the show went straight down to hell, i thought it had a dreadful ending and in the latter half the show, they screwed up the characters way to much especially Stein, he started of as this legendary scythe master and this really powerful guy and ended the show as some girls bitch .. being one of my favorite characters to begin with, this let me down. \
some other characters who were initially put out\
          \
        to be really strong proved themselves to be absolutely useless in the end. \
this anime had a good start but the worst end (hey there sword art online) but if your really bored and want to see an action/shounen really badly, then go ahead. \

    To put it bluntly, I'm not a fan of this anime.  Not that it's bad, I'm just not a fan.  (Haters not welcome.) That being said, my biased opinion will be saved only for the last part of this review.\
Story: The story of soul eater revolves around an alternate version of our world where witches, shinigami, laughing/bleeding suns and moons, as well as the possibility to eat one's soul is possible.  In the school of Shibusen, students are trained as both wielders and weapons in combat.  The weapon students are able to shift into various weapons ranging from swords to heat\
          \
        lanterns, to pretty much anything imaginable weapon-wise.  And so, is the basic background of the story.  The story itself is broken into 2 halves where the 7 main characters must fight in order to SAVE THE WORLD!  Each half is featured with a specific witch.  While yes, the overall story itself was well done, the one thing that bugs me is the ending.  The ending, I must say is the biggest cliffhanger ever.  When all is said and done, the anime sort of, ends.  There's no clear resolution after the fight, there's no monologue to explain what happens afterwards, hell, all they really do is smile and, roll credits.  \
Characters: Undoubtedly, the characters are a big plus, to a certain degree.  First, we have Maka.  As the main protagonist, she possesses a leader-like nature and strives to be like her mother.  While being short-tempered at times, she is caring and appreciates her teammates, especially her partner soul.  Speaking of Soul Evans, he is the weapon of Maka and the next person to be mentioned.  Taking the form of a large, oversized scythe, Soul is probably the definition of \"swag.\" (Sorry, but it's kind of true.) Trying to act as cool as he can be, soul initially starts as a platonic guy who \"tries\" to act cool, but later, becomes more caring seeing as he doesn't want to hurt the people close to him due to his \"condition\" later on.  More importantly, he cares for his technician, Maka, the most.  Next, Black Star.  First off, that's a really strange name.  (Who names their kid with 2 words as a first name?) As the last surviving member of the star clan, Black star is the epitome of arrogance.  Always saying that he's big, (ironically, he's the short member of the group), and that he's going to overtake god, Black star always tries to show off as best as he can.  While yes, it may be funny, the whole show off thing got tired incredibly fast.  Later in the series, he starts to become more proactive with teamwork, while still possessing that mentality.  His weapon Tsubaki is basically the complete opposite of him.  As kind and forgiving as she is, she is pretty much only character that can stand black star to the largest degree.  With the ability to transform into more weapons then any other weapon, Tsubaki is one of the most helpful characters that has probably existed due to her versatility.  Next, is Death the kid.  Death has Asymmetriphobia, meaning that he dislikes anything that isn't symmetrical, heavily.  Because of such a random phobia and being put into an anime, Death has some of the most memorable scenes that exist in Soul eater.  Because his phobia gets in the way at times, his fighting capabilities can be greatly reduced when something is symmetrical.  Likewise, his fighting capabilities increase highly when something isn't symmetrical.  Cue episode 3.  Ironically, his 3 white stripes in his hair, aren't symmetrical.  Being the grim reaper's son, he is given the right to succeed his father when he dies.  As the more mature person of the group, (whenever things look right), he is usually calm and thinks situations through, rather then black star who goes all gung-ho with everything.  And finally, we have the twins Patty and Liz.  As the identical pistol weapons of death the kid, they share completely different personalities but care for DTK in a big way.  Other side characters include the grim reaper, Maka's player dad, Blair the fanservice cat, Medusa, Stein the sadistic human-experimenting scientist, and Arachne, and Crona the spazzy genderless person.  \
Sound and Art: The sound in this anime has an interesting tone to it.  The first opening was unfavorable to me at first, but it grew on me, much like the uniqueness of this show.  While I couldn't even get through the first 10 seconds of the first ending due to how off-key the first lyrics sounded, the music in this anime is adequate.  The second opening did sound good, but to me, it doesn't fit with how this anime is.  Great opening, but not befitting of this anime.  The art is also another strange but interesting thing about this anime.  With the lack of eye detail as most animes have to a certain degree, and a simplistic looking art style, soul eater has a strange contrast.  While the art is mostly done in dark colors, it was made in a very light looking setting, which is very strange, interesting, unique, and good.  The backgrounds themselves have a great care to detail to them and are commendable.  \
Personal enjoyment: Since I started watching this show, I've been very on and off about it.  I like it, I hate it, it's just very confusing for me.  Some things I liked was the bleach spin-off that involved people as weapons, not just some spirit.  I also liked how well all the characters worked together in order to defeat the large threat.  Also, how some of the characters' names are just horrible puns.  What I didn't like was how slow the anime went during the transition stage of going to the next arc.  Also, the fact that they added some characters without really specifying in detail their purpose or reason to be there.  Ex: Giriko.  As well as the really weird ending where all the concepts that were concreted into the anime's basis were just thrown out the window in the last scene of the final fight.  While personally, I'm not a fan of this anime, if you want to see some insane-looking action scenes and fights that could determine the fate of the world, or you're just an action/fantasy addict, I would highly suggest this to you.  As a last comment, I just want to say one thing to a specific character.  I HATE YOU EXCALIBUR!!!\

Great character development, amazing soundtrack ( I am obsessed with ending 3 and my sister who doesn't even like soul eater has the opening on her iTube playlist) nice action scenes ( maka and soul fights are the best fights I have ever seen) and good story.

    While this review will not have spoilers, it will be a bit of a rant\
When Soul Eater first began being published, many critics were comparing it to FMA in terms of overall quality, in addition to the fact that it was being published in the same magazine that published FMA as well. As a result, I was keen to think that this series would be as good or better than FMA, one of my all time favorites. While the manga did in fact live up to my expectations, the anime fell short. VERY short.\
The problem with this anime, like many before it, was that it\
          \
        was being produced BEFORE the series ended. This created a problem for the animators, should they stop halfway and pick back up when the manga was done or should they create an anime only ending. The creators of Soul Eater decided on the later, and that decision single-handedly ruined the series. Not to say that anime-only endings are universally bad (The original FMA series had an excellent, if depressing, anime-only ending), but Soul Eater's is the absolute worst one I've ever seen. Lets move on to specifics.\
Story: 7\
While certain aspects are certainly cliche (seriously why does every other anime have to be based on kids in school?) the overall story is fairly unique and interesting. I never really knew what was coming and the way the story progresses is very well done. Right up until the ending. Seriously it becomes PAINFULLY obvious once the anime takes over from the manga because the overall plot development turns to crap and it feels as though they just crammed a bunch of ideas into a small time frame and by the end you'll just be thinking what? Seriously? That is so lame\
Art: 8\
Arguably the strongest point of the anime, the art is fairly unique and while it takes a while to get used to, you eventually begin to enjoy to gothic-like undertones and colors as much as the bright, vivid clarity you get in other anime.\
Sound: 6\
For me the sound was meh. Wasn't exemplary but it got the job done\
Character: 8\
Probably the strongest part of the original manga, the characters in Soul Eater are all unique and interesting, and there is a feeling that the author put a lot of time constructing each character to be different but likable, and the main leads are all very excellent and well done. However, due to the anime not following the original manga it lacks a lot of the serious character development that occurs in the manga, especially with my favorite character, Black Star. By the end every character except the two main main characters stop developing, which is a shame because they are all very interesting in their own right and deserve to have their characters grow and mature over time\
Enjoyment: 7\
Despite my rage over the poorly done anime only ending, I still enjoyed this series. It was still fun to watch even if the anime ending left me pissed off at how lame it was. I can only hope that like FMA they create another series which follows the manga more closely, since this series deserves a better anime then it was given.\
Overall: 7\
You get the point. I hate the ending, but the series as a whole is good. I recommend stopping about 2/3 of the way through as that's about when it starts doing the anime-only thing and being crappy.\

    I found this anime to be first and foremost depressing.  The art style was depressing and just worse than mediocre.  It wasn't particularly funny, and worse it wasn't even amusing.\
The characters are absurd, typical, bland, meh.  I'm struggling to understand the appeal.\
The show was so boring and slow, that it should have been 11 episodes.  maybe if it had been shorter i would have appreciated the only action scene worthy of descript which occured in the final few episodes.\

    Like others said, Soul Eater is an incredible anime. Some may think it's corny (that's what my friend said) and I, myself, thought I won't enjoy the show when I  accidentally catch my cousin watching it but when I started to watch from the first episode, I was blown away by its awesomeness. The action scenes were great but what mostly caught my attention/heart was the characters. I think the characters of Soul Eater are the ones that makes it special. I love how Soul Eater is Halloween-themed, the extraordinary designs (e.g. laughing sun, purple sky), the opening/closing theme songs as well as the\
          \
        character songs. Papermoon has got to be the best opening theme song. Anyway, I regret for saying I won't like this anime... it turns out it became my all time favorite. There were times I was laughing so hard while watching, crying like a baby (mostly because of Crona) and just simple amazed I couldn't speak. I like the humor in Soul Eater. There are times the story can be so dark but what I really admire in Soul Eater is that almost everything's in balance. When there are depressing moments, later I'll be laughing my ass out when watching. Soul Eater always excites me even though I probably watched it a lot of times. I'm not really sure why but it's probably because of the main characters. I adore them all along with Crona (who I think is a boy in the anime and girl in the manga). It's just too bad that it only 51 episodes and that it didn't follow the manga anymore somewhere around episode 37 (and I know why they did that). Soul Eater is the first anime/manga that I finished but the manga is still ongoing so I still read every month's update. In my opinion, the manga's story is way better than the anime (from episode 37+). But I can honestly say that the characters' looks were developed in the anime. Though that doesn't mean they look ugly in the manga. In fact, they also look cool in the manga especially when they're in their Spartoi uniforms (Okubo-sama really improved!). For me, Soul Eater is the best anime. It has a neat story and great characters. It would be nice if there are more episodes of it. It's really an interesting anime if anyone's into supernatural stuff, action, school life, friendship... now that I mentioned it, friendship and teamwork is such a big deal in it and that's another reason why I love it. When watching SE, there's actually moral lessons and I have grown to appreciate my friends more because of SE. Probably the only thing that saddens me is that Soul Eater lacks romance. I know romance is not one of its genders but we, fans, would all like to at least see Soul and Maka being lovey dovey for ones. Haha. But it's already obvious that they're a couple (in my eyes). I enjoyed Soul Eater and it made 2011 my favorite/best year since it's the year I watched/finished it. :)\

    Often times things with big problems begin with smaller problems, and Soul Eater is no exception. For all the problems this series has, one thing that bugged me a lot more than most of the faults was the fact that at the beginning of the show Maka and Soul are shown to be an unstoppable force, and yet not to much later they basically  shout the fact that they need to improve on every level from the rooftops. I know that seems like a minor problem, but they never address the inconsistency of it. Still, even with all the faults it has, Soul Eater\
          \
        is genuinely enjoyable and incredibly fun.\
Soul Eater is about this academy wherein kids learn how to become hunters of evil spirits, but it becomes something more as the series progresses. More on that later. The set-up itself, while not entirely original, is made interesting enough and is a great backdrop for what the series is really about; the characters. It has a great diversified cast, most of which you will grow to love. Each of them has their own personality and quirks that help make them more likeable. The heroes especially come across as some form of awesome, and most are very well characterized and have actual character arcs and evolve beyond the typical cardboard-cutouts of more boring, uninspired, shonen series. Though this also applies to some of the villains as well. The reason I'm being incredibly broad here is because if I actually described why each character is good we'd be here all day. However, there are two good characters I want to talk about. I know a lot of people hate on Excalibur, but I actually find him really enjoyable. The degree of quirkiness he possesses is just too fun to hate. This is probably one of the few examples of pulling off a deliberately annoying character without them actually being annoying. The concept of Excalibur is hard to hate because there's no point in taking the piss out of something that's already taking enough piss to fill up a water tower. At least, that's how I think of it. The other good character I'd like to talk about is Crona, an embodiment of what makes the good part of the cast of Soul Eater. At first, I didn't like Crona because he (I'm going to refer to Crona as a guy, both for the sake of the review and for the fact that that's the gender I perceive him as) wasn't characterized well at all. I remember saying at the time that it would take a ridiculous amount of development for me to change my mind, and to my surprise that's exactly what I got. His problems, struggles, and emotions are well-developed and well-characterized. It makes for an incredibly good character\
I've mentioned that I don't like some of the cast as well. That's the thing about the characters of Soul Eater, whenever the aren't making interesting, fun, and amazing characters, they make characters that are incredibly horrible. Medusa being the biggest offender. Not only because she's evil for no good reason besides being a villain for the show, but also because her motivation keeps changing and can't keep a consistent bland villain type. She also comes back unnecessarily comes back after the show had already replaced her. This is also why I don't find Eruka Frog and Free particularity good either. Arachne, Mosquito, and Giriko all make for better villains, so there's no reason they needed to come back, especially Free. Free already made one reappearing act (being mysteriously unfrozen after he was left behind in the first episode we see him in) and making two makes him seem not likeable. Even if they didn't come back for no reason, both of them are still kind of bland. The other two characters I hate are Little Ogre and Ragnarok. Both of them are annoying and Little Ogre is completely unnecessary. Still, most of the cast is good enough to make up for these mistakes they tried to pass off as characters, but it defiantly would be better without them.\
Now, let's come back to the story. As it progresses, it becomes an easier target for criticism. The basic set-up it has is all needed to be a great story because it needed to just play second fiddle to the characters and awesome fight scenes. However, at one point it drops the fiddle, takes out a bass, and insists on playing \"Another One Bites The Dust,\" \"Feel Good Inc.\" or anything by Primus. That kind of confusing metaphor means that the story tries to become the focus of the show instead of the characters, with little success. Whenever it tries to get deeper than it needs to be it becomes incredibly stupid and more often than not not worth it. A good example of this is when they try to make us question the legitimacy of the school and it's Headmaster, Shinigami. You could see where it was going from 50 miles away and it ended up not worth any pay off whatsoever. I feel this show has the opposite problem that Kampfer has. Kampfer needs a deep interesting story-line that it barely has, and Soul Eater barely needs a plot, but tries to have a deep and interesting story-line. Still, I will say I like Kampfer's story more than Soul Eater's, if only because I feel sorry for Kampfer and this is the only area it can compete with Soul Eater. To it's credit though, Soul Eater keeps the great characterization and great fight scenes while the story is busy embarrassing itself. As for the ending that everyone's down on, I thought it wasn't that bad. It was a return to form by being simple good vs. evil with no gimmicks behind it, besides awesome fight scenes. Basically, the story should have stayed in the background instead of trying to hog the spotlight, because it didn't do well in it.\
The music for Soul Eater is really interesting and fun to listen to. It's fast-paced during the action scenes, ad more complex during moments of characterization. The theme songs are great too, except for the first end theme, which sound like taking a fully decorated Christmas Tree and trying to shove it in your ear. The second end theme isn't all that great either, but it's head and shoulders above the first one. As for the voices, the sub is better than the dub, for a two word reason: Brittney Karbowski. Her Black*Star voice is annoying as hell, and too effeminate for him. Most of the dub is alright though, the biggest improvement being Kent Williams as Sid because he emotes more, but the sub version is genuinely better. The art of Soul Eater looks very stylized and worth every cent it used on production. It looks incredible and unique at the same time.\
Overall: Soul Eater is an anime with a mostly hit, sometimes miss cast of characters. The hits among the cast make the show worth watching, along with the fight scenes, most of the music, and the art. It also makes it unique in flavor. Sure the story breathes with ts mouth open, but eventually you just learn to ignore its attempts to compete with more story-heavy anime. 8/10\

    This is probably the show that got me into anime. Dragonball Z may have been my first but this is what got me into anime. Now before I review this, just know that I am aware that the manga does it better, for longer, and in better detail. I get it, but as far as what happens after the anime ends, I'm drawing a blank. Clearly I need to reread the manga again (it is on the list of series that I'm going to read). Although, there is something to be had about the anime series. So since I decided to binge the entire anime\
          \
        in a night, let's do a review about it for those of you who haven't seen it yet or just like reading reviews of anime they have seen before and just want to see if people agree with them. I know you are out there.\
Story: 8\
As far as story goes, there may be too much to talk about. I guess summing up the premise is a start. So in this world the soul is actually a tangable object. But what this world also describes is that in the fear of death, a servant of death kills people to become strong enough to be able to not fear death. This, in turn, creates the kishen. Kishen are humans who consumed too many human souls. And when I say consume, I mean it. Since the soul is a tangible object, it can be eaten, literally. So people are trained to fight people who are on their way to becoming kishen and tuning their weapon into one fit to be weilded by death.\
Also these weapons are also human......\
Yeah, a  big draw in this story is how unique the set up is. Honestly I haven't seen an anime quite like this. Humans who can turn into weapons partners with people specifically matched to wield them tasked with eliminating other humans that threaten to world by nearly becoming a being of fear and power. Can't say I've seen something quite like it. Although, you may not quite feel like the focus is always on story progression 50% of the time. As querky as the story may be, filler hell this is. Maybe not to the level of some animes like Bleach or Naruto (yes I went there), but enough to take notice. Some may say that since the plot is focused on something related to the plot that it is fine but to me spending three episodes on a character interaction that ends the same but is done through three different characters is not progression of the plot. Anybody who has watched the anime knows about the white, annoyance that is this character. \
However, despite the filler, there is something to these episodes that make them intersting enough to stick with. To me, it's the characters but I will get to that. Just know that this is a pretty awesome story adaptation and is still worth watching again. (5th time by the way).\
Art and Sound: 7 and 8\
I am a firm believer that if the art is good, you don't take note of what is wrong, or even what's good, about it. After 5 times of watching this show all the way through, I can say that that statement rings true. Honestly, it gives off thar Cowboy Bebop feel of animation but run through more modern software. I would also refer to Kill La Kill but that show does it over the top as a part of the style. Here it's natural but modern at the same time. The only thing that is holding it back is honestly the same thing I would give it praise for. Because its an art style we have seen before but done cleaner, we already have referance of older works to rely on. Although, in the end that is all the art has to offer. It good but not revolutionary. Will it take you out of the anime? No, it won't. But it won't be what you remember this anime for.\
Sound has it better since we have such amazing opening and ending pieces. Any time I think of this show, I end up humming one of the songs. Voice acting is also really good since you will recognize a few voices here. I watched it dubbed so Chuck Huber (the guy who voiced Stein in the english dub) became all the more recognizable across other animes. There really isn't any wasted talent here.\
Character: 9\
I said I attributed the reason I remember this show so fondly is to the character themselves. This is where you can really draw the Cowboy Bebop connection. Everyone of importance is querky but also not unreasonable to the point of being unlikable. There also isn't a single overused archetype that I recognized across all my time watching. It feels fresh to watch these characters and honestly that is why I enjoy the filler as much as the main plot episodes.\
Enjoyment: 10\
Honestly, you will have fun with this anime version. Sure the manga is better in a lot of ways but there is a lot to love with this version as well. If you needed more convincing, this show was dubbed into three other languages besides english. So, it's clearly loved around the world with  a wide audiance. So if anything, there is something for everyone here.\

    The story gets a 7.  It's a promising premise that I personally like.  \
The art is not the best thing about the anime unfortunately.  The art gets a 4.  It's not hard to look at, believe me I've seen worse.  \
The sound gets an 8.  The music is very great and pleasing to the ear, while fitting the mood.  \
Characters are all great and different.  You have the control freak Maka partnered with the laid back child guy Soul.  Then you have the loud, wild, expressive guy Black Star, paired with the accepting and sweet Tsubaki.\
          \
         Even the other background characters are different personality wise and have different ways of achieving a goal.  They make for fun moments, heartbreaking moments, and funny moments.  There are some characters that I like, and they have moments that make me dislike them for that moment.  I love the mental gymnastics of the show in that regard.\
Though the enjoyment was a 3.  I did like the story up until the end.  I don't like to be that person, but the ending kind of ruined it for me.  It's like they took their time with fleshing out the characters, developing them, and they took their time giving them challenges to overcome.  Unfortunately, it seems that they rushed the ending out.  My brother, sister, and I were on the couch watching it and enjoying it.  We binged watched it over the summer last year and enjoyed it.  The ending had all of us like, \"What the fuck?!  That's the ending?  It really ends that way?\"\
Overall it gets a 7.  The ride was a great one, but the destination made it anti climatic.  \

    Note: I did not read the manga. I liked the character designs and the world setting. I liked the concept of meisters and weapons partnering up to fight the good fight. I loved the background designs and the fictional settings. This series follows the shounen epic formula while avoiding most of the clichés that plague the genre. For one, it’s coed, something I really look for in anime these days. Also I never once thought the show suffered from having a girl in the lead. Maka is cute and likeable but also brave and heroic. Another thing I liked is the cast size. I counted\
          \
        22 characters not counting the villains and witches. Bleach has 39 counting captains, lieutenants & Ichigo’s friends and family (counting him). So it was easy to keep track of who all the characters were and what they could do. The action was face paced and entertaining. Now my favorite characters were Black☆Star & Tsubaki because their motivations were the clearest and I liked the contrast between their personalities. \
Which brings me to the shows flaws. Death The Kid’s complex about symmetry played for good laughs, but only came up when the comedic effect was needed. I would’ve enjoyed seeing this complex hamper him in serious situations, even if for laughs, more. That said I feel the show lost it’s comedy balance towards the end. The tonal shift wasn’t jarring, but it is noticeable. Another issue is Blair. Like some dope in a suit said, “This will never sell without fan service.” so they created a character whose sole purpose in the show is to provide fan service. I’m no enemy of fan service, but given how little she actually appears on screen I feel the show could’ve got by without her.\
<spoiler> I wanted to score this higher but two things only make above average. One is another anime with a vastly overpowered villain who simply doesn’t smite the heroes; because if he did the story would be over and the bad guys win. At least explain why the heroes still have a chance in the face of overwhelming power. The other is the end is just lame. It kinda makes everything that came before hand redundant. <spoiler end>\
In conclusion, Soul Eater is a good show different enough from the rest of the genre to justify watching. But it’s not a suitable alternative to the genre. Watch it if you’re into this sort of thing, don’t if you’re not.",

    OKAY let me put this disclaimer at the start: I'll try my best to be as objective as possible for this review, BUT I personally really really enjoyed this show so there will be bias in this review. \
Right from the start I was already drawn in by the characters, I truly felt that the character design was top-notch with every character given a unique flavour and vibe that adds to the enjoyment of watching this series. Character development for the 3 main meisters was well paced and it was really heartwarming to see them grow and develop over the course of the anime. \
One\
          \
        of the things I would like to point out is that Soul Eater will be one hell of a emotional rollercoaster ride. I'm not certain if it's because I got too invested into the characters and hence over empathising with them, but even if that's the case it means that the show had done a good job with character engagement with the audience. The show starts out slow, with an episodic style with minimal continuation, but still enough suspense to keep you coming back for more. Every episode seems to hint at something, and you feel something build up as the episodes progress, and its that subtle feeling that trouble is brewing that really hooked me into Soul Eater. Weirdly enough, this anime had a fair share of really emotional angst scenes even though its a comedy genre. This is what turned some people off in the later episodes, but personally I could use some angst so I was sucked deeper into this series (lol). But if you're a fan of comedies, then this show is a must watch because the antics of BlackStar and Soul Eater are HILARIOUS and will have you laughing at how silly everything is. The pacing in this anime was perfect for me (and apart from the two really annoying filler episodes of Excalibur) all the episodes were deeply enjoyable and satisfied me. \
Now on to the art. I really really liked the art style. It was simple and easy to set your eyes on, and it felt fresh. The action sequences were also a feast for my eyes with a variety of fights varying from sword fights, hand on hand combat and guns. The soundtrack for this series is also something different from your usual soundtrack, with most songs having English lyrics and being pop, and the change to a sadder music when the time required it, every piece of music really suited the scenes and it just flows so well you won't even realise that the music really played such a huge part. \
If you have been reading other reviews, you would have come across people saying they were disappointed by the ending, or by the second half of the series when things got more serious. If you have not read the manga, then it the ending isn't really that bad, maybe you might consider it slightly underwhelming, but for me it was perfect. \
Another thing I want to add, is that this show actually cleverly dealt with many of the internal conflicts and struggles that we have within us. With the main enemy of the show being \"the madness that lies within us all\", and how we fight it every day so that we're not overtaken by it. It was really beautiful, and the dialogues in Soul Eater were written really well, and there are takeaways in this anime that resulted in my emotional stir at the very end of the last episode. \
I hope you will enjoy Soul Eater as much as I did. (: \

    I expected Soul Eater to be an average cliche anime, but it really proved me wrong! I thought it was weird to see humans as death scythes and actually found it sort of humorous for the first few times, but I got used to it! Anyways, enough rambing; time for the review.\
**Story: 7; good**\
It wasn't outright amazing but it was good. Lord Death, or Shinigami-Sama, has created the DWMA to protect Death City against kishins and train weapons and meisters. It's pretty cool if I do say so myself.\
**Art: 8; very good**\
I LOVED the art style! It's unique, smooth, and simple! I love how the\
          \
        art style slightly changes in Death's room and how the background is just shaded so coolly. It's very different from other anime, a thing that I value in an anime.\
**Sound; 7: good**\
I liked the voice acting a lot. (I was watching the dub, by the way) Their voices matched their personality! Black Star was noisy and obnoxious so he sounded that way; DTK was uptight and sounded that way; Tsubaki was calm and quiet so she sounded that way also. The voices weren't AMAZING but they were really good!\
**Character: 8; very good**\
I think the characters are a tad underrated. Yes, they are kind of cliche, but they have some different aspects that make them interesting! Black Star is the typical obnoxious, boisterous character on the outside, but inside, he's conflicting with himself and battling his insecurities. Tsubaki appears weak and shy-ish on the outside, but inside, she's strong. I could go on, but you get my point. My favorite character personalities were Soul and Crona. They were so interesting! I also found Stein and Black Star interesting too.\
**Enjoyment: 9; great**\
I really enjoyed this series! I did not get bored for a single second! It was serious at times, fighting scenes weren't too often or repetitive, it was interesting, it had humor; it was great. I normally don't watch long anime (hence why I haven't watched One Piece yet) but this one was really good! \
**Overall: 9; great**\
This anime was just really good. Interesting characters, emo non-gendered kids, and all. This one is probably going to be at the top of my favorites forever! It's unforgettable. If you haven't yet watched it, I recommend it.\

    By Far one of the best anime's out there. Totally recommend for those who are into Action and Fantasy,It has a serious Spark to it but also adds in some Comic relief such as Death the Kids ocd.\
Each of the Characters are completely different which is Great,They each have their own views on Life but all have the same goals ,Protect each other and save the world. The fighting scenes actually look good in this anime as opposed to a lot of other action animes I've seen before. I watch a lot of Shinigami anime and this was one of the best I've seen. \

    All the way from the beginning the show told us that It's important for maester and the weapon to work in synergy, with deep enough connection they can overcome everything, absolutely everything. There wouldn't be a maester without a weapon and vice versa.\
(Sound body, mind, soul etc...)\
Maka and Soul had constant relations development but for what? In the end Maka did the courage asspull and oneshotted the omnipotent kishin with a single punch without any assistance from Soul, except the whole squad was cheering for Maka from their weird positions. Ending the series with a very unsatisfying note, not giving any closure.\
Mind you, this wasn't\
          \
        even that comedic and it all just ended abruptly. They even built up the demon sub-plot with Soul since the first half of the series and in the end all that wait didn't get rewarded.\
Other cringeworthy thing was the sudden plot postcard from Maka's mother and Maka's sudden weapon form which was super weird and not needed. Why the hell did they even bring that up when all she did was show it for 10 seconds and lose?\
They also had so much development for Black Star too who achieved the 100% connection super saiyan mode with Tsubaki. He didn't use that form even once during their generic laughable giant boss fight. For all this time they built up Black Stars character for surpassing the gods and other great deeds, in the end he was defeated off-screen.\
Kid unlocked that new weapon which was very reminicent to Death's style, in the end it did absolutely nothing except make the Kishin revert to his earlier stage which probably was stronger than the slow giant mode.\
Not to mention people recovering from getting impaled and mutilated for 2/3 of their bodies.There was so much things they rushed in the last 15 episodes that it felt like it was a whole other series.\
For the good things:\
+ Every single character was likeable\
+ Great soundtrack\
+ Art and animation\
+ Very impressive voice acting, I loved the seiyuu of Maka, Kid and Black Star\
+Genius filler episodes\
+Good plot and character progression till the latter half\
+ Distinguished itself from other shounen until the final half when I literally drowned in cheese\
-Rushed plot\
-Asspulls in the end\
-Shounen tropes in the end\
I would've give it as high as 9/10 but in the end it fell into strong 6/10 or weak 7/10.",

    For what it's worth, i actually kinda enjoyed Soul Eater. However there were certain conditions that had to be met before i truly enjoyed it:\
1. Death the kid had to be in the episode. He was probably the only character whose personality mirrored the show. With his serious tendencies completely overshadowed by his ridiculous flaws that made for a few good jokes. Tldr; he wasn't treated so seriously.\
2.Developments happened in the episode. I dont know about anyone else but it seemed to me that Excalibur served as 2 things: filler and someone to divide the script with.\
3. Blackstar was getting his ass handed to him\
          \
        in the most brutal, crushing and violent way possible. It may just be me, but I think that Blackstar is the most cringey, egotistical, big headed waste of ink that has ever existed in this media form. I know his personality is designed this way but if i had anyway of reaching into the screen, i would choke the f***er before he could even say anything. And i'm honestly surprised that none of the main cast thought the same way. (he alone dropped my character rating to a 6, ignoring other flaws).\
Otherwise, you have a pretty OK show with a few ups and downs. However if you are looking for other 50ish episode long anime where teenagers fight a greater evil while going around fighting lackeys (sprinkle some plot development on there as well), then i would probably reccomend that you watch something like FMA and/or FMA:Brotherhood first (if you haven't already) because i feel like the extra comedy that it has makes it much more fun to watch and it would have done wonders for Soul Eater (especially in the second half... yeesh, gloom alert).\

    Not an amazing series, but, once you push through the first few episodes (actually, I'd suggest you skip the first three which have a lot of annoying, ecchi fanservice -  things will still make sense), you'll be able to enjoy a quirky and fun, Tim Burton-esque story. The characters can be kind of flat sometimes, but they're still likeable and have cool designs that - if you're a sucker for aesthetics like me - you'll adore. The action scenes are quite good. While the animation isn't the best, it also has some cool graphics that give it a certain creepy-cute charm to it. The\
          \
        first opening is the best and I wish they kept that one, but the others are good, too. Stories are usually quirky, however there are some more serious and dark ones that may make you feel things. Overall, you should definitely give it a chance. \

    The Death Weapon Meister Academy is a school built for the purpose of training anthropomorphic weapons and people to act as Death's soldiers. Death himself cannot leave the city built around the academy, so he has Meisters and their weapons protect the status quo. In the world of Soul Eater, there exists an evil presence that the Meisters prevent from causing untold destruction. Maka Albarn and her weapon partner Soul, two students at the DWMA, amidst their studies and training, are thrust into trying to save the world from a problem Lord Death started centuries before.\
Soul Eater's premise is interesting, and its eventual plot keeps\
          \
        itself engaging. However, it is a series well within its roots of shonen manga. It doesn't do a lot to try to break molds or stray from tropes, and deus ex machina is still very much alive and well throughout. These aren't necessarily problems, as they come with the territory, but if you're looking for something that follows a road less trampled, Soul Eater is not for you.\
With that said, they do at least justify most of that stuff better than a lot of shows I've seen, and despite being fifty-one episodes long, it keeps itself moving at a decent speed. There are some slow bits, and some things took a lot longer than they really should have, probably meaning someone had to pad for time, but it was never too slow to be enjoyable. The story is, overall, well told and executed, if a bit generic and cliche at times.\
Speaking of generic, though, the art style is nothing new either. It's cartoony and looks like a lot of other shonen anime. They do a few things different here and there to make it stand out, but ultimately, it's nothing ground breaking, and if you don't like the way cartoony anime looks, Soul Eater isn't going to change your mind at a glance. Also like a lot of other shonen series, there are a lot of shortcuts taken in the animation for episodes that advance characters, rather than the story arcs, but when the animation is kicked into high gear, it looks pretty good.\
For a series that almost defines shonen, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the music in the series is mostly rock, with some slower piano scores thrown in for emotional scenes. Most of it is alright, and it's used appropriately, but it's ultimately forgettable.\
The acting in the series is similar; it's good, but it's not really anything special. The cast is garnished with some less-than-huge names, but for the most part, it's a lot of people that normally do extras or smaller parts in bigger productions. The voice acting is far from bad, in fact it's quite good for a shonen series, but it's not the best I've ever heard.\
All in all, Soul Eater is a good series, if you can forgive some of the flaws that come with the territory. It's got a unique premise and interesting story, it's got a good sense of humor, and the dub is fitting. Overall, I give it a three out of five, for nearly hitting the definition of shonen, but changing just enough and executing well enough to be worth watching.\

    Soul Eater is a good anime. It is very comical at times, and it does develop an involved story over time. It has a cast of crazy characters that really drive the overall flow of the story, and it has a lot of exciting moments. It is definitely worth watching, and I would recommend it to anybody who likes action filled comedy.\
That said, I only gave it a 7 because it fell flat for me at the end. There is a great buildup, but the way it concludes left me feeling slightly robbed. The ending simply didn't match the pace of the buildup in the\
          \
        story. It almost felt a little underdeveloped in the most seemingly important story elements. It did have plenty of the \"cool\" factor, it had enough drama, but it just had a rocky delivery. \
I loved most of the characters, and I loved the concept. There were times when I loved what I was watching, and then there were times were it moved a little slow for me. Perhaps if it was a little shorter and moved a little faster then it probably would have scored a little higher on my list. \

I dont watch very much serious action anime but this one was the first and I have to say it was better than I tought it would be. The only reason I watched this anime in the first place was because one of my best friends sat me down on a couch and made me watch the first three episodes with her.

Story 9: The story was unique and though im not very into the action genre its the only one of its kind I have seen and I enjoyed it very much. The ending is very good to and the story is deep so its important to pat attention and enjoy it to the fullest.\
Art 8: The art was very good and I liked it a lot. I thought everything was done very well.\
Sound 10: The sound was great and I loved the oppening and ending themes I know them all by heart.\
Character 9: I loved the characters they were all very funny and had very good personalities. There was no romance other than Marie and Stein which I found to be a very good match for those two. If you watch the show and come up with any romance other than those two im afraid you will be very disapointed. All of the characters tie into the story somhow and the bad guys were all ironicaly very good :-)\
Enjoyment 8: I enjoyed this anime very much. Other than the fact that I was practicaly forced to watch it I found it to be very funny and action packed.\
Overall 9: This is a very good anime.\

    I think a good example of how to explain what Soul Eater is would be if Tim Burton made an anime. It's filled with zombies, ghouls, and other characters living in a world that looks like Halloween Town, but enough of the comparisons, let's get on with the review.\
Story: 7\
The story starts off simple enough. In this world, there are meisters who are attempting to turn their partners, who can turn into weapons, into death scythes. However, the plot changes into a battle with an evil witch, spider, werewolf, and other creatures. It's not a really complex plot, but the show gives you enough information\
          \
        that it allows you to just have fun, because that's what it is, it's fun, and there's nothing wrong with that.\
Art: 7\
The animation is very creative with a lot of crazy designs. Studio Bones did a great job with keeping the animation consistent with the overall tone of the series.\
Sound: 7\
The music consists of hip hop, rap, and rock music to go with the style of the series and it does the job well, though there weren't any tracks that particularly stand out with the exception with the first opening song, which is one of the best anime openings ever, in my opinion. I watched the show dubbed when I first saw it and it was pretty good as the voice actors matched the characters well. \
Character: 8\
The characters are very unique with a few that have personalities that I haven't seen before. The main cast consist of meisters and weapons, where their partners are the polar opposite of each other, but they work extremely well together. The supporting cast also have their own distinct personalities that makes them enjoyable to watch, including the villains.\
Enjoyment: 8\
I thoroughly enjoy this show and it's one of my favorite shonen shows. The ending is a little bit of a letdown. It's definitely not the worst ending, but i feel like they could of done a better job, especially since the rest of the show is great.\
Overall: 8\
Soul Eater is such a crazy and fun show to watch that you shouldn't afford to miss out. This may not please everyone, but if you love action shows with supernatural elements to it with some comedy here and there, then you should like it fine. You can watch online such as Funimation, Hulu, etc. to see if it's your cup of tea. Or you can buy it somewhere, it's up to you. Hope you enjoyed my review and take care.\

    An exciting and vivid anime, with it's share of funny and serious moments.\
I really liked this anime overall. There was action every few episodes, if not every. The battles were exciting and had very cool visuals. The idea of meisters and weapons, was really cool in my oppinion, and the teams of meisters/weapons that were made really fit together well. The bonds between them was true friendship, and the struggles for eachother were well done.\
The story overall wasn't too amazing. Bad guy, good guys attack, etc. Everything seemed very much okay, but the ending was to be called; Deus Ex Machina, Something random happens. No\
          \
        explaination for it, and it just seemed lazy. This was because of the shortage on funding, but I still feel disappointed.\
Good anime, very funny and nice to watch. The story sometimes lacks, but that doesn't keep it from being a very enjoyable anime. 7/10.\

    I remember the first time that I heard of soul eater. I thought 'Ok, this might be worth watching'. I was blown away by how much this show was 'worth watching'. The plot itself makes the anime straightforward and action filled. But dig a little deeper, and you see the comedy and friendship underneath.The characters them self add to the comedy, but also to the plot. In other words, they were able to balance the two genres of comedy and action perfectly. I highly recommend this anime, although, I warn you to not have children around for when Blair the cat goes on the rampage.\
          \
        Fortunately, you do not have to deal with her very much. One more thing that sets this anime from other ones. This anime is more cartoonish then some of the others, such as death note. Again, I highly recommend this anime to those who love to laugh, as well as those who like a good fight scene.\

    Soul Eater is one of my favorite animes ever. It was, as you can say, my gateway anime, as it got me interested into watching more and more.\
Soul Eater is a very interesting anime. The premise is quite unique. In a world where Lord Death is portrayed as a lovable odd-ball, two types of humans exist, Meisters and Weapons(people who have the ability to transform parts or their entire body into an actual weapon). Weapon and Meister students train at Lord Death's Academ DWMA (Death Weapon Meister Academy). They train so they can protect the world from witches and demons. \
Soul Eater excels at almost\
          \
        everything. The characters are all lovable and fun to watch. Maka is a normal braniac, Soul is \"Mr. Cool Guy\", Black Star at first might seem annoying and arrogant but later he kind of lives up to his name. Tsubaki is really sweet and kind. Death the Kid is awesome with his OCD for symmetry and awesome reaper status, and his weapons Liz and Patty are really funny and chill. The other characters are also really awesome.\
The soundtrack and art are amazing. Death City looks like Halloween Town sprinkled all over the place and each character has a distinct look to them. The Openings for Soul Eater are catchy as heck, when I first heard both of them, I instantly downloaded them to my mp3. One flaw with the series is its rather rushed ending and typical shonen tropes. Although they aren't big, so they wouldn't bother you that much. \
In the end, Soul Eater is a must watch for those who enjoy a kick-ass action/adventure anime. \
Note: if you don't like the ending, watch it again. You soon start to like it more you watch it.\

    This is my first review, so this might be terrible.\
\
It's quite uncommon to find an extremely popular shonen anime that is actually well written and not just tons of filler (Bleach, One Piece etc.). Soul Eater however, is the exact opposite of those shows. This one of the rare shonen that actually deserves all the popularity it gets.\
\
STORY\
The story at first, might seem pretty generic and formulaic. In the first few episodes, it tells about how each student at the DWMA must collect 99 evil human (kishin) souls and 1 witch's soul. This may seem like the main plot after the first few episodes, but\
          \
        the story actually gets deeper and more complex as the show goes on. It also has a good mixture of action and comedy, having the perfect times for action and the perfect times for jokes. The only problem with the story is that it tries to tell to much, to the point where you might forget something that might be important later in the show.\
CHARACTERS\
The characters are in my opinion the best part of this show. \
Maka and Soul are the main characters of the story, Maka is always easily annoyed by everyone around her, but is very determined to succeed throughout the story. I at first didn't like this character, but she eventually grew on me as she developed in the story. Soul is another great character who only wants to protect  Maka, but he hides that by trying to be cool and laid-back.\
Black Star (a.k.a Naruto 2.0) wants to be the strongest in assassin and one day surpass God. I'll be honest, I really freaking hate Black Star, his cockiness got annoying really fast. His partner Tsubaki on the other hand is a much better character. She only cares about the well being of her friends, especially Black Star.\
Death the Kid is a great character, his personality revolves around his obsession with symmetry which usually gets the better of him during a fight. His partners Liz and Patty Thompson, are always there keep under control and stop him form going insane.\
The side characters are also very good. They all seem very important to the story in one way or another. But some of them are way more memorable than others.\
Whether you love or hate them, these characters are what will keep you watching.\
ANIMATION\
The animation of this anime is done by Studio Bones, so you know the animation is going to be fantastic. If you don't know who Studio Bones are though, they have done animation for other great anime such as Fullmetal Alchemist and Wolf's Rain. Bones ever rarely has bad animation, and Soul Eater is no exception.\
It's very rare that the animation looks bad in this show. This makes action scenes look like candy for the eyes and keeps you interested in what's going on the whole time.\
The show's atmosphere is very dark, using a lot of black and purple for their color scheme. And it fits the show perfectly. \
If I had to pick my favorite thing about this show, it would definitely be the animation.\
SOUND\
The openings for this show are very memorable. Both openings \"Resonance\" and \"Paper Moon\" are extremely upbeat and fast-paced, and get you very excited for what's to come. The endings aren't as memorable however. The only one that you'll probably remember is the last ending \"Strength\", the others are pretty generic and forgettable.\
As far as voice acting goes, both the Japanese and English voices fit the characters very well. One of the best voices in the dubbed version is Micah Solusod as Soul. The only problem I have with the dub is the voice actor for Black Star. I don't know who thinks that male characters need to be voiced by females, but the voice for Black Star is almost as annoying if not equally annoying as Naruto's.\
As far as the Japanese voices, I can't say anything about it because well...I don't speak Japanese.\
CONCLUSION\
Soul Eater is one of the best shonen that has been made in recent years. It has rightfully earned a huge popularity, and if you have yet to see it I recommend it if you want a great anime.\

    Story: 8/10\
Soul Eater revolves around 3 groups of students at the Death Weapon Meister Academy (DWMA). Students at the DWMA are either meisters or weapons. Each duo (or trio) consists of a meister and his/her weapon (or weapons). If they succeed in collecting 99 Kishins (evil souls) and one soul of a witch, the weapon becomes a Death Scythe and can be used by a Shinigami. The first 3 episodes introduce our main characters and after that we get to see the adventures they have.\
Art: 8/10\
The art in this anime is different; the art I've seen in most anime up until now all resemble Naruto\
          \
        in some way. This was definitely a pleasant surprise.\
Most of the scenes are dark, but somehow they don't give off that \"gloomy\" vibe.\
What I really enjoy the most are the action scenes; though Maka and Soul have their ultimate move, each time they perform it, it doesn't feel \"repetitive\" (\"Kage Bunshin No Jutsu\" cough cough…)\
Sound: 8/10\
The first OP is pretty good, fits in nicely with the anime. The first ED is an interesting song. Personally didn't like it too much, but think it also fits the anime.\
As for the soundtrack, I have no complaints.\
Characters: 8/10\
You'll definitely grow to like a few of the characters very much. I really like Maka, In part because she isn't drawn like the \"typical\" anime girl and her VA is also different. Maka is the serious, gets straight to the point kind of character; her partner Soul is the guy who always wants to be cool and wants to become the ultimate Death Scythe.\
Black*Star is the loud, brash kind of character while his partner Tsubaki is the opposite, she's sweet and gentle.\
Death the Kid is obsessed with symmetry and at first I thought his character was going to be that of an entitled and snobby kid (he is the son of Lord Shinigami), but surprisingly he doesn't turn out that way. Though he's already a shinigami, he still decides to enroll at DWMA and doesn't shove his skills in everyone's face.\
Overall: 8/10\
All in all, fun anime to watch. Love the camaraderie between all the groups and seeing the bond between each meister and his/her weapon.",

    OM NOM NOM!!!\
Ah Soul Eater! One of the most popular anime series to date. With 51 episodes filled with action, betrayal, humor, mystery, horror, filler, and death, Soul Eater has everything you'd want in a Shounen anime, and more. If your looking for a review from someone who just finished the series, you've come to the right place! Sit back and enjoy!\
The story for Soul Eater is nicely done in my opinion. It has plenty of filler episodes explaining the back story of the characters more. Some may find filler to be annoying, but the filler in Soul Eater is extremely entertaining, and helpful lore\
          \
        wise. The character development is great as well. You get to explore the backstory of all characters a little more every episode. Even the side characters are put together relatively well. There are a few minor plot holes, but nothing really big. Overall the story is put together nicely.\
Going into Soul Eater I honestly have to say I was a bit...worried, one could say. The first thing I instantly noticed was the animation. Soul Eater defiantly has more of a North American \"style\" of artwork then most. When watching anime animation is a huge factor for me personally. Some may disagree, but if you're all about the aesthetics then you'll definitely notice the change of style Soul Eater has. Although the animation may look a bit strange compared to others, trust me, you'll definitely grow to like or even love it overtime.\
The reason why the animation is easy to grasp onto is because it gives each and every character a distinguishing trait you'll always recognise then by. For example, take Maka's plain green eyes, or Deaths mask. Some of these little details give the characters more of a recognisable personality trait, which I quite enjoyed.\
As for sound I honestly have to say it was what made me stick past the first episode. The music is very enjoyable, and voice acting is surprisingly extremely well done. The sound quality was enough to make me love the series instantly. Although the music is well done (I've even downloaded some of the OST's) I have to say that the voice acting is what sells it's sound quality. I absolutely loved the voice actors in this series, as they essentially gave their character a personality. It's obvious that each voice actor put extreme effort into their character.\
As for my recommendations for watching this anime subbed or dubbed, I would say watch it subbed. The dub is pretty decent, but the sub gives the characters a lot more of a personality. I'm not saying that the dub doesn't do this as well, but the sub does it a lot better. I haven't completed the series dubbed, but I can say that the sub is better in quality. \
One of the issues I had with Soul Eater though was it's ending. Don't worry, I won't give spoilsies about it, but it is extremely fast pasted. You never really get to see what happens after the last fight. It instantly cuts off and ends. I cringed a bit at this, but it was one of the only things I really disliked about this series.\
Well...I think that covers it all, or most of it at least. With that being said, I hope you've enjoyed, or found this somewhat helpful. I'm no professional, but I hope I helped a bit. Thanks for the read!\

    Okay lets set this straight, I've finished the anime and found that it was really good, but the ending could've been tweaked. But anyways lets get on with the reiview. The humor in here bares pretty weak fruit and isn't funny as some would make it. The action though is fantastic and should not be missed. The plot idea revolves around the way they fight and is so clearly expressed once you watch. As for actual plot, its pretty good, but a little stretched and is confusing at times; with those lame mystery moments.\
Overall, 8/10. And for those who have heard about the ending crisis,\
          \
        don't worry, its not bad its just cliche. Plus there is a little treat concerning Maka that makes the end awesome.\

    What can I say about Soul Eater that has already been said? The action is fun and fast pace, the humor is great between the characters through out, and the story takes it time to develop so you can adjust to the environment.\
Going into Soul Eater I knew nothing about it but had high expectations based on the impression my friends (mrjakereed and Shancakeschan) had given me. Not only did Soul Eater meet my expectations but it blew them away! the most memorable Soul Eater gave me was the great characters.\
The plot was unique being that Ive never seen something so different from anything else,\
          \
        the things that Corona goes through was new to me and memorable, the character development with all the main characters and even the Antagonists was fun to watch as the story progressed. Over all for a short anime it got a lot of stuff achieved that most animes dont in its time span and it does them phenomenally!\

    The anime, while starting off like the manga, is great at the start. If you want a good story, you should get pretty far into the manga before starting the anime, so you don't lose the continuation.\
Even with the rushed ending, it still has very many good parts. The action, the tense scenarios, the insanity, the atmosphere, and the humor are all to be admired in an anime.\
The anime, limited to 51 episodes, is rushed to a finish in a lame fashion, much like the initial FMA airing prior to Brotherhood. This is what I greatly disliked about the anime, otherwise it was quite enjoyable.\

    I first started watching Soul Eater in early 2008 around its release and stopped half way through.  I wanted to re-watch the entire series so I could add it to my review list; I remembered thinking the series was only moderate at the time and did not expect much.  I could not have been more wrong it was pleasantly refreshing to watch this series.  At first glance the Art Style present in Soul Eater may seem estranged; it is and that is what makes it so unique.  The animations are crisp yet fluid which in combination with the unique art style\
          \
        provides for very nice series visually.  The overall plot is creative and is accompanied with decently deep amount of character development allows a good story to be told.  Soul Eater presents many serious scenarios with much comic relief.  Even though some of the situations might seem to be serious it is hard to take anything as so especially with comic relief coming from two of the main characters as well as almost all of the supporting characters.  Some of the comic relief comes in terms of perversion but, it is not over done.  Soul Eater is a great anime series with striking visual appeals, imaginative designs, and artsy content providing for a fun and humorous show.\

    Ahhhh, Soul Eater. Despite being an anime fanatic, I have a strange habit of being reluctant to try a series. Most of the time I'm disappointed when I finally do try a series out. Occasionally I'll be super pleased when I do try something out. Soul Eater was one of these anime that was pure enjoyment.\
First, I'll tell you why I was so reluctant to try this series. When I first read the plot, I was completely uninterested. I don't really like series that are too long, since they tend to get really repetitive, lose pace and plot, and I lose my patience. I honestly\
          \
        thought Soul Eater was one of those series like Naruto or Bleach that has a solid, simple plot and then just goes on and on and on. No, I did not want to even try this. But under cliche, typical circumstances, I collapsed-- I got bored. I watched it.\
And boy, was I thrilled.\
\
Story~\
Yes yes, it sounds so cliche. A bunch of random kids want to be powerful so they attempt to \"level up\" their weapons to get there. This is the main plot of the series, and it's centered on this. Or... So you thought. Later on, it takes a twist. And I don't mean that some random guy comes out of nowhere and tries to take over everything. No. The plot is well thought out and very enthralling, and actually becomes more and more unique as it progresses. Everything in Soul Eater is interesting, entertaining, and very fun to watch. And no, there aren't a lot of episodes like I thought there would be. I never got bored or impatient with the episodes. There are fillers, but they're mostly fun, and they're only in the first part of the series. After that, they stick to the intense plot.\
\
Art~\
Soul Eater's art really caught my eye. Not only is it unique and very cartoon-ish, but it's fun and gothic-looking when it needs to be. When it needs to be bright and happy, it is... which... doesn't happen too much. It isn't a depressing series but it does a good job of balancing the two. The movement is very good, and each scene is fluid and fun to watch. The camera angles can be sort of unique sometimes, which really helps add to the mood.\
\
Sound~\
Soul Eater has a wide variety of soundtracks. Each one improves the scene and the mood you're supposed to feel. Some of them weren't oh-so-memorable, while others were. But the opening theme songs? Actually, those were really dang memorable if you ask me. They're catchy, awesome, and the animation is brilliant. Anyway, onto voice acting (which... I've totally neglected in my other reviews...) The Japanese is always the one for me. They do great work with their roles, and each character is delivered perfectly. But the dub... It's average-ish. Some voices stand out a thousand times more than others, either because they're good or just plain awful. No offense, but Crona and Medusa's voices in the dub are... almost painful to listen to. But that's just me. If you're a dub freak, watch the dub. If you prefer Japanese, by all means, please watch the Japanese version...\
\
Character~\
Ah, the characters. Each one is unique. Though they do have their own cliche attributes, there's much more than what you see on the surface. Much more. Maka may seem like a smart bookworm, but she's strong, determined, and kind. (Though she does haveher moments, like the rest of us.) Soul seems like the cool, sort of unsociable type, but he's actually a really fun character and has a ton of soft spots. There are a ton more characters than that of course, but why don't you watch Soul Eater yourself? Anyway, they're really all enthralling, and all the side characters are fun, and the main ones are just amazing. \
\
All in all, Soul Eater is something I could recommend to almost anyone. Again, it's a matter of taste (just like any other anime on the whole planet) but I think it's really worth your while. This was actually the fourth anime I ever watched, and at that time I deemed it the most unique. It really is a treat to watch.\

    Soul Eater starts off with an exciting first episode with unique weapons and amazing actions scenes. After a strong first episode, the anime continues to deliver right to the very end. Even the filler episodes contribute to display emotions between characters. The series animation is different than the typical anime but definitely uses this to its advantage. It takes odd looking smiles and unusual gestures to display everything from comdey to immensely creepy feelings. The only thing holding the anime back is the ending. It did not deliver a warm fuzzy feeling in its closing minutes that an anime of this calibur should deliver. Hopefully\
          \
        once more volumes of the manga are released a second season will ensue.\
If you enjoy fast paced action scenes with a almost perfect blend of humor and emotion, Soul Eater is for you. Easily one of the best anime series I've watched in my life.\

    Soul Eater and I go back. It was pretty much the first anime I ever watched and that has created a bit of a problem for me.\
See, nothing can meet my standards now.\
Soul Eater set the bar too high, so that the majority of shows out there just pale into nothingness in comparison. You may have gathered, but I really like this series.\
Why do I like it? Let's go by category, shall we?\
Story\
Soul Eater, for the first 30 episodes or so, has far and away the best story line of any anime I've ever seen. It really kicks in around episode 9 and hooks you\
          \
        so that you stay up till ridiculous hours going 'just...one more... episode...'\
The first three episodes are largely exposition. The first episode sets the tone of the show and the other two follow suit, though not with as much oomph perhaps. After that, threads start to evolve which later all link into a cohesive whole.\
Other people may be crying out that other shows have better stories, but I disagree. For example, people on this site seem intent on giving series' like \"Noein\" full scores on the basis of their stories. Er, I'm sorry, but how the hell did you actually follow that plot? My point is, just because something is outlandishly complex, does not make it genius. Soul Eater is smart, direct and gets to the point without episode long explanations of quantum mechanics.\
That being said, even I - being enamoured with this anime - will admit that it loses focus post episode 28ish. The manga is incomplete, so the studio had to come up with their own ideas. They do relatively well, up until the final episode, which I won't be discussing because I'm sure it's been bitched about ad nauseum. \
Moving on.\
Art\
The art style takes some getting used to. You'll see. A lot of things have eyes and facial expressions which ordinarily wouldn't have eyes or facial expression. So trees... the moon... the sun... They become motifs in the show, which, although thematically inconsistent (particularly in the case of the moon) add a certain eerie charm. The art makes the anime extremely distinctive; this isn't a style that you are going to mix up with another shows. \
You will get used to it, and will probably grow to find it irrisistably charming. I did. \
I also prefer it to the manga's art, though I have not read the manga, only seen a few scans. I have aspirations to start a Soul Eater manga library one day (when I have money...), so I refuse to read it online now.\
That little tangent aside.\
Sound\
The music is ridiculously catchy. Both intro's are worth listening to every time you watch an episode. I'm particularly attached to \"Paper Moon\", by Tommy Heavenly6. This is the second intro; be ready for the awesome.\
And yes, the endings grew on my too. So... happy. \"I wanna be\", by Stance Punks. It's loud, it's fun and it makes me want to jump around on furniture.\
The music in the episodes is also epic. It's worth looking up Blackstar's theme, \"Never lose myself\" both to listen to and for the sake of the lyrics. If you are having a crap day, there is nothing like mindless and unshakable arrogance to shrug it off. Repeat \"I am invincible; there is no doubting it...\"\
Stopping briefly on the voice acting, can I please recommend that you watch this with English dubs? Seriously, it's the best cast ever. Laura Bailey is perfect for Maka and this is weird, but I think it's the way she screams. It's hard to describe, but please see episode 9 :P Micah Solusod is relatively new to the industry, but for me, he made Soul, Soul. And yes, you will get used to Blackstar being voiced by a girl. By the end of the series, you will have entirely forgotten. Respect to Brittney Karbowski.\
Character\
Ah, the section I've been waiting for!\
Soul Eater's characters make the show.\
At first glance, they are all character stereotypes. Blackstar is sort of like Naruto on steroids, I guess.\
Trust me, these characters aren't flats. Not even Blackstar. Frankly, I reckon he makes Naruto look a little cardboard.\
Maka - Maka is a meister, meaning she uses a humanoid weapon (i.e. Soul) to defeat enemies.\
Female protagonist... who can look after herself? Is it possible? \
Maka is kickass. She's uptight and a bit of a nerd, but when it comes to beating up kishin (the baddies), no one makes it look cooler.  She has something of a complex about boys, thanks to her adulterous dad. The relationship between her and her father, Spirit, is very sweet and generally highly amusing to boot. \
Soul - Soul is a weapon (he can change into a scythe) and Maka's equal in coolness. Which is saying quite a lot. You get the impression that there is  a lot of depth to him, which is sadly not fully explored in the anime. (For example, why does he object to being called 'Evans' by a certain red demon dude? It is his surname...No doubt this is fully expounded upon in the manga.) But Soul is still multi-faceted and interesting, despite the lack of concrete information. He is also a really nice guy, who - in a departure from anime stereotypes - would never cheat on Maka.\
That's not to say they are a couple... But their relationship is probably what makes this show so watchable. You know they care deeply for and trust one another implicitly. It's a partnership as it should be: equal.\
I'm not going to explore the other characters, because that would probably turn this review into a novel. I will state though, for concerned watchers of this show, that the Blackstar you see in episode 2 is the character you will see for the rest of the show. No, he is not going to get less loud and obnoxious. You'll just forget that he is those things.\
Enjoyment\
This series was amazing for me, but the last episode did grate, obviously.  Still, I don't think it's fair to degrade the whole anime based on this one episode, which frankly wasn't THAT awful.\
So, despite this flaw, I can't bring myself to give Soul Eater less than 10. It was just so far beyond the league of the shows I saw after it. As a result, I am stubbornly giving a full mark.\
And waiting patiently for the 'Brotherhood' version of the show.",

    I am totally changing this review. I cna't believe what I said about the story!\
first of all, I LOVED this anime. The story was very simple, but in the ending there were a couple plot twists that made the story almost perfect. There were also plot twists in the begining, and hints leading up to the end, witch kept you watching. The story leads beutifully to the conclusion also.\
The characters were interesting, except for the main characters. I found the main characters original, and some of the bad guys also original, but it seemed each character added flair to the story in his/her own way.\
The\
          \
        action:\
the action was just awesome. each character had a unique weapon/ability/partner. there was really no NOT unique weapon, of course expect for soul, maka's death skyth. \
heres just a side not, the show made maka and soul look like a couple from the begining, but nothing ever happened. that was a bit dissapointing.\
unfortunatly the end was a little undesirable, only for me. I would like good endings for EVERY character. Also, may I add, the ending was WAY too short, and didn't elaborate on what most of the characters did/what happened to them or the DWMA, and Death.\

It got to the core of madness, it was a little creppy at times which was amazing. It captivated me. I loved evety episode and the characters were all so diffrent yet they all worked together.

    A great anime with great characters. The show mainly focuses on Maka and Soul but is more ensemble casting also focusing on Black Star and Tsubaki, as well as Death the Kid and Liz and Patty. The show's premise works well in getting in a lot of characters without fighting scenes becoming overly talky or bogged down with trying to get seemingly so many characters into a fight. The anime is great and works with some interesting themes as the show progresses. \
When I was first introduced to the show I only saw Black Star fighting, and your first reaction to him should be along\
          \
        the lines of \"Naruto clone/knock off\" but he's much more. He's over the top but has a really vulnerable side demonstrated none the better by his fight with Kid (if I recall they fight several times so its not a spoiler!). Maka and Soul are the most \"real\" characters in how down to earth their personalities and dreams are. These 2 pairings also create a nice bit of romance suspense being boy/girl pairs. \
The Art is certainly bold and different. But it works well within the show and serves as a great little world for which these crazy powered teens can live in. \
I'm a sound guy so I typically judge it by one of two things. Did I notice it, and if I did why? Sound's one of those things most people never notice like all the background music in any TV Show or Movie that is always playing. If you never notice it, its doing its job fantastically. If you did notice it, why and how was it being used? For Soul Eater I largely didn't notice the sound until music was actually used in the plot. It was different, jarring even, but reflected extremely well of the character it was meant for. \
If you watch this show up until the Battle for Brew you need to read the manga. Its even better and has a bigger cast (other students in the anime act more like filler even though in the manga they're pretty integral to parts of the story). The anime and manga also caught up to each other at this point so the story starts to differ greatly. For instance the Manga is still being written as of Oct 2012. \

For those of you who like Tim Burtons work(What I meant by liking Tim Burton's work is that if this anime was made in America instead of Japan, I know Tim Burton would be involved somehow), this is the anime for you. The chracters are funny. The action is great. The world of Soul Eater looks like that of Halloween Town from Disney's The Nightmare Before Christmas. If you like comedy and action with a dark twist to it. Than I recommoned you watch this anime. A perfect 10 in every catagory!\

    Soul eater has a few things it does exceedingly well. First off its soundtrack is amazing, full of catchy sounds and twisted effects it really is a treat for the ear. Another thing it does well is showcase its characters evenly, they never really focus on one character more than the others, if anything the villains get explained more than the main characters.\
There is a few lacking things in soul eater tho, the biggest i felt was artistic appeal. Some characters like Maka got really exceedingly plain or just ugly character designs while others like soul and black star are done fairly well given more\
          \
        details etc etc. The world art is interesting as it takes bizarre settings from its crazy sun and moon too the twisted forests and deserts. \
The plot itself kinda drags on in a lot of places, its not a bad plot or anything it just slows at a point and it gets very boring. It also seems like the mission to get 100 souls takes a huge back seat to the rest of the show. I am glad that it was not the main point but it is a part of any synopsis  i read when this show came out and i feel it unfairly describes it.\
The shows more about stopping the revival of asura and not this mission to collect souls and become death scythes. When the characters actually start fighting i found it was black star who had the most interesting sequences of all. The other two characters have very plain and boring abilities while black star seems to always surprise everyone.\
Anyway i give the show a 7 based on sound/character/enjoyment /art about a 5 for story tho, only part i felt lacked.\

    Soul Eater was definitely an enjoyable anime; I miss the characters now that I'm finished. You have to get past the beginning, though -- it seems a bit childish and strange at first -- but after the first five to ten episodes, it gets a lot better. The art style takes some getting used to, but again, it really isn't bad. The characters are very likable -- that's my favorite part about this series. The only thing I really dislike is how the characters tend to repeat themselves in order to establish their personality, especially in the beginning of the anime, which is a main\
          \
        reason why you need to sort of get past that in the beginning. For instance, Soul always says the word \"cool\" to establish that he wants to have a cool image. Strangely enough, they don't do it half as much toward the end -- either that, or I just didn't notice it as much. \
Anyway, once you get into it, Soul Eater is definitely worth watching. It gets epic and somewhat suspenseful, and it's light and humorous while still keeping a darker side. I want a sequel!\

    Personal Opinion - Soul Eater is really one of a kind anime. Watching it, is a very overwhelming experience. You get so attached to the characters that you even seem to care about them. This anime has both it's humoristic and thrilling moments. The story line is quite complex yet attaching and creative. You just fall into this whole other world were new things just come up every episode. \
Plot - Set at the \"Death Weapon Meister Academy\", the series revolves around three teams consisting of a weapon meister and (at least one) human weapon. Trying to make the latter a \"death scythe\" and thus\
          \
        fit for use by the academy's headmaster Shinigami, the personification of death, they must collect the souls of 99 evil humans and one witch, in that order; otherwise, they will have to start all over again. As the show goes on, numerous foes will rise up such as Medusa, Crona, Spider Witch, and of course the first ever Kishin. \
Overall thoughts - I really think Soul Eater is an anime masterpiece, i recommend this show to everyone who like anime's filled with action, twisted yet humouristic situations, abnormal amount of power from the characters and of course and amazing story line.\

    Shounen. Something i usually do my best to stay away from because well, they usually end up, in my opinion, as crap. Shounen, at least their most popular shows, as we all know as the big three, Naruto, Bleach and One Piece, usually have dragged out plots, childish crap, with decent storylines. This doesn't mean i never watch shounen as i grew up watching stuff like DBZ, Inuyasha and the oringinal FullMetal Alchemist. But as i got bigger into anime i realized that some shounen are not 7,000,000,000,000 episodes long, and can be even better than anything the big three has to offer, such is\
          \
        the case with Soul Eater.\
The story to Soul Eater is funny actually because it starts out with you believing that this show will be about your main characters collecting souls to form a death scythe. The show starts out introducing three teams of weapons and meisters. Meisters aere people who run around collecting some messed up souls to keep the streets clean for lord death, aka the grim reaper. Meisters weapons are actually people, that transform into a weapon, anything from the average sword all the way to insanely awesome things like two transforming into two pistols. However, the story takes a different turn and brings you to a save the world plot, and that's the show shines, because at this shows core, it's a action adventure show. And it is fun, but nothing speacial.\
As far as the animation is concerned for soul eater, it looks awesome, this show never seems to looses its budget as bones did an amazing job here, especially with character designs. This show is classicly called a Halloween anime, and that is perfect for this show. The fact that your characters main leader is Lord death, it really just has a Halloween type feel to it. So the animation is awesome.\
The music for Soul Eater is pretty cool as well. The show has a mixture of rock and rap tracks that, in all honesty, couldn't be any better. And if you are anyone who has half a brain, you will know that the first opening of the show is absolutely amazing. Alot of people say that the second one is the better of the two openings in the show, but that's what opinions are for right? and as for dub vs sub, it's pretty much sub on this one because the dub is well done, but a few characters just don't sound as good in the dub as they do in the sub version. Maka just was not cast right and my god black star is absolutely annoying as all hell. On the plus on the dub, best performances have to go to Chuck Hub as stein as he fit the bill just right and for the sheer amount of awesome, Alphonse Elric's voice actor, Maxy Whitehead does Crona, and he does it just as well as he did Alphonse, thank you Maxy.\
The characters of Soul Eater are actually the best part of the show. They each have specific goals and quirks that make them awesome. However to get this done' without writing 20 plus paragraphs, i will look at the main three teams that you see through the show as the cast is ginormous! You have Maka and Soul, who are what the entire first episode is focused on. Maka is a girl that has two defining traits, she hates her dad for what he's done in the past, and she is the character that always takes the front line showing that she's always got the guts to give it her all. You have Black Star and Tsubaki, Black Star being hyperactive version of Naruto and seeks to be the best assassin of all time. His weapon Tsubaki is a pair of chain sickles and is kind of Black Star's voice of reason.... Kind of. You have Death the kid and the Tompson sisters. Death the kid is the reapers own son, and well, his only real defining trait without spoilers is that he has an obsession with symmetry. His weapons, the Tompson sisters, turn into two pistols which kid can fire rapidly. All characters are very fun and entertaining, and i would go on but, never the less, spoilers.\
So should you watch Soul Eater? Yes, the show is a very entertaining shounen and has it's faults, such as a bad dub at points, some annoying characters, and SORT OF poorly done plot, and some unanswered questions, but it really isn't about that. It's about the fun all the way to the last episode, and believe me this anime is fun. But I would say give it up about at least episode 6 or 7, because that is when the show really picks up. \

Just before the end of the \"body\", there is a 3rd party, and it kind of gets you excited for a 3 way war of manipulation, mind games, tactics and strategy, but they instantly kill off any of that sort of potential right away and opt to go for the oh-so-overdone\

When I first got this anime, I watched the first two minutes and closed it because I didn't like the art style, and it didn't seem interesting to me. About a year later I was really, really bored, so I decided to sit through it.\
And I'm so glad that I did.\
Story (8)\
After the first few episodes, you're led to believe that the main characters goals are to gather human souls in order to become, or to make their partners become a death scythe. You soon find out that the story strays completely from the original objective, but it does it in a really good\
          \
        way. The story never got boring.\
Art (10)\
The art style was honestly amazing, which is one of the things that surprised me the most. As I said earlier, I didn't like the art style at first but it quickly grew on me because of how insanely unique it was, especially with the halloween-ish theme. It also had quirks here and there, like the sun and the moon which were fantastic. PLEASE don't let the artwork scare you, because it might surprise you too.\
Sound (8)\
The music stayed interesting and nice. Some of the songs I loved, others I thought were okay. Overall, I liked it very much.\
Character (10)\
This is by far the best thing about this anime. Most of the characters are unique, interesting and complex, and are easy to fall in love with. The characters are split into groups, because they all have battle partners, but each of them roll of each other perfectly. Some of them stood out more than others (Cough, Death the Kid, cough cough), but they all seemed to bring something to the table, and sweet lord can they be funny sometimes. \
Enjoyment (10)\
I found myself watching episode after episode so quickly, because I didn't want to stop watching. I also started to get very sad when I only had about 15 episodes left - I didn't want to see it end. \
Overall:\
I would recommend Soul Eater to absolutely anyone. It's definitely one of my favourite animes overall and I'm extremely glad that I gave it the time, and I would again.\

    Soul Eater is an amazing anime that is very enjoyable.\
Story:\
The first episode makes Soul Eater look like your typical anime. Human weapons and their student technicians live in Shibusen and have to collect 99 evil human souls and 1 witch soul in order for the technician's weapon to transform into a Death Scythe. Later on, the story develops into that of a very interesting one. However, it is really easy to follow. Soul Eater is action-packed, funny, but at the same time emotional. The anime's Achilles heel is that there isn't really a memorable plot or event that makes you think.\
Characters: \
The characters of Soul\
          \
        Eater are what keep me watching, and although exaggerated, I can relate to each of their personalities in a way.\
Sound:\

Overall:\
Soul Eater is an amazing anime that I would recommend. It doesn't have many filler episode and maintains a constant theme. Although when it does have filler episodes, they are really annoying. I say if you're looking for an anime that will entertain you but doesn't need much thought then you've found the right one!\

    well soul eater is a very good anime. the charecter may be goofy at times but when they get into battle they mean business...well death  the kidd maybe sometimes hes not. soul and maka are very good at being partners and stubaki and black star are great too. the story is about a weapon and his/her master have to find 99 souls and 1 witch soul. if they find all there weapon will be a ultimate weapon. it has adventure and a lot of fighting scenes that will make you want more . if you want to know more then just watch the anime.\

    I thought this was overall really awesome. I have to say though, the writer and i have the same issue. They give information but never fully explain it, leaving crap loads of questions. For example, in earlier episodes it was stated that maka could not see lord deaths soul, giving viewers the accusation he was without one. But in later events, he performs soul resonance with spirit. The question becomes, how can you soul resonate with a person with no soul? another question was, How is the surname \"Evans\" connected to soul and why dose he dislike it? That could just be fully explained in\
          \
        the manga but i wouldn`t know i`m on like chapter 2 at this time i am writing this review.  So besides leaving us on cliff hangers with small things, i have to say i like how in the end the whole moral was bravery. It kind of reminds me of the dumb ways to die theme song. Through out the whole entire song people die in idiotic and simple minded ways, but in the end, just as in the anime, the moral was the last line stated \"Be safe around trains, a message from metra\". So i guess it brings a sense of realization at the end, when you finally have to plug all the events together and actually think how it all works out. Overall though, i really enjoyed it. Im glad that after being bugged about it for a few years i finally watched it and i recommend it to other people as well. It really is a great source of entertainment, and has some valuable indirect lessons. It also has words that if really taken to heart, can really impact you life positively tremendously, if used the right way that is.\

    This was one of my starter animes and I can just say that it was amazing. The characters were great along with the story. If you are into weapons with magical powers or powers in general, then this anime is for you my friend. It will get you very emotional in some episodes, but it will pump your adrenaline up in some others as well. If you want something that will do that, then you just have to watch this anime.\

    It is such a great anime that I was not ever recommended to, I seen other people's reactions to the anime so I decided to check it out. In the beginning, it seemed great and all, then it became intense later on which got me hooked to watching 20- 25 episodes per day. It is such a shame that it had to end at 51 episodes, hoping it would continue. The story changes with optional storylines at times since they felt like putting fillers and stuff, it is a confusing story-line since I never read the manga yet; planned to read it sooner or later.\

Its just one of those animes that no one can dislike (almost no one), perfectly AWESOME! story line, the characters are exceptional~ And the city and landscape is aweosmely halloween-ish :D Anyway~ At first the its hard to tell who the main character is or going to be, but it plays out and becomes Maka and Soul, who have a kinda of sister brother relationship which is fitting become of the two of them being weapon and meister. A highly recommended anime by all! :D Please watch and\

    Well, what can I say about Soul Eater? It's a very difficult anime to rate. On one hand, the plot can be sometimes generic. On the other, character development is (usually) very good and it's a very enjoyable show, and I don't even like shonen anime.\
**Story 6/10**\
The story can be slightly generic. Yes, there's an organization fighting for good! And yes, there are bad people trying to stop them! But the thing that sets the story apart is that it's not just two sole organizations-- there are three (DWMA, Arachnophobia, Medusa). It's interesting because even the villains are working against each other, making the dynamic\
          \
        very unique from most other shonen anime. I'd say it's above average, but not great.\
**Art 9/10**\
As I said in my Naruto review, I'm not a stickler for art. It's something I really couldn't care less about. However, I should note that Soul Eater's animation style is drastically different from most anime. It's more cartoony and cutesy. Character designs are, in my opinion, very well drawn (except I don't really like Death the Kid's white stripes on his hair, sorry). Characters range from downright adorable (Blair and Shinigami-Sama) to fucking creepy as hell (Medusa, Arachne, Asura). Some characters' designs can be somewhat ridiculous-looking (Mosquito, Shinigami-Sama), but tend to add more charm to the show than detract from it.\
**Sound 7/10**\
Both the openings are just great. I prefer Resonance, but Black Paper Moon is a very good opening too. The endings are decent. They're not as good as the openings, barring the 3rd ending, which I really liked. The music in the show is very situational-- during a certain point in the anime, you'll hear operatic-sounding music in Latin or Italian (I can't tell which), and sometimes you'll hear very upbeat pop songs, as well as creepy, sinister music. The diversity of sound is probably one of the strengths of the series. EXCEPT: One voice actor. BLACK STAR. His voice, much like Naruto's, is so grating on the ears that it's reason enough to want to strangle him. This drags down the enjoyability of the sound, as I'd rather not sit through 20 minutes of him bitching about transcending God and all that other crap.\
**Character 5/10**\
This is, by far, the hardest section to rate. On one hand, some characters show immensely interesting backstories and character development, such as Maka, Soul, Tsubaki, and Dr. Stein. However, other characters can just be downright annoying, like Black Star and Death the Kid. I know I'm going to get a lot of crap for putting those two characters down, but I couldn't stand either one of them. Kid is okay when he's being serious, but when he's whining about symmetry I want to smack him.\
I feel like Black Star really needs to be addressed. Many claim that Black Star has great character development, but I don't really see that. He was lighthearted and fun at the beginning, which made up for his annoying-ness. However, as the series progresses, he starts to develop a SERIOUS attitude problem, making him my least favorite character overall. Not to mention he steals the spotlight from the two protagonists (Soul and Maka). I feel like Maka deserved more screen time in comparison to Black Star. I also don't like how Black Star was FAR overpowered. These factors really drag down the rating for the characters.\
Now onto the good stuff: I found Maka, Soul, Stein, Shinigami-Sama, Tsubaki, and to a lesser extent Crona, to be extremely fascinating protagonists. Each had goals and motives and personalities that were radically different, and many had internal struggles that really brought to life the story.\
The best part by far were the antagonists. Medusa is so creepy and awesome that it really carries the series. Whenever I get annoyed by the protagonists, I look forward to seeing what Free, Eruka, Medusa, Arachne, and even Asura are doing. They're so deliciously malevolent that it really adds a spark to the series.\
(NOTE: If you're wondering why I didn't put Excalibur on here, it's because I feel like I'd be beating a dead horse. YES, Excalibur is fucking annoying, but otherwise irrelevant to the main plot. Those episodes are skippable, and not mandatory to understand the series.)\
**Enjoyment 8/10**\
This is where the show really shines. This anime is very enjoyable (barring the annoying scenes with Black Star). Even if you HATE some of the characters, they do oftentimes get retribution, and characters annoyed by their behavior are occasionally vindicated (like when Tsubaki throws a shuriken at Black Star). The characters can be funny (Especially Shinigami-Sama), and comedy is hit-or-miss (mostly hit :D). I found this to be a redeeming factor of the show :). \

    Story: 7 (Good)\
Let's face it, Soul Eater doesn't have a really strong plot. We're half-way through the series, and I fail to see (thus far, anyway) why characters such as Excalibur were even introduced, since at first he seemed that he might be a major character eventually, but we hardly ever see him do anything. This might well change of course, who knows, and this goes for more than one character, such as Blair for example.\
Anyway, whatever plot Soul Eater does have (yes, it does have one) is apparently split up into two \"arcs\". The first Medusa Arc, and the new Arachnophobia Arc seem to\
          \
        be the two major parts of the series. Neither so far seemed/seems to be too clear in what the final goal really is, but we know there is a main enemy waiting to be defeated, and of course, Soul and Maka's quest to turn Soul into a Death Scythe.\
All in all, the story is the weakest part of this show, but it doesn't render it unlikable or unwatchable. Not at all.\
Art: 10 (Outstanding)\
It's top notch, there is nothing more to say. The quality has remained consistent through-out, and hasn't been cheapened in any way. Worth the watch in HD!\
Sound: 10 (Outstanding)\
You thought Resonance was awesome? I like Paper Moon even better, myself. Sound effects, music, this show has it all, just the way you'd want it. No complaints.\
Character: 9 (Great)\
New characters are now being introduced, and all the old ones are still there. Character development in this show is done in such a way that you learn as you go, but still get a general idea what each character is about and how they tackle their situations. Black Star is brash and rushes in without thinking (and has a huge ego), Soul is cautious and calculating, yet can also be somewhat direct, you get the picture. If you're watching the show (which you should be), then I don't have to explain much more. If you're not watching it and are reading this to see if you would like to, trust me, you'll get to know the characters within the first three episodes. It's all you need.\
Character development could be better, but is pretty great as it is.\
Enjoyment: 10 (Outstanding)\
So far, I haven't watched a single episode I haven't found enjoyable. I'm not kidding, every single episode has something in it that will make you laugh or go \"YAR! KICK THAT ASS!\" You'll find yourself cracking a smile here and there even if you are the harshest anime critic around, and you can't but help rooting for the good guys. Enjoyment is a hard thing to explain, but you always know that you're enjoying something when you... Well, when you are.\
Overall: 10 (Outstanding)\
Despite some of the obvious flaws in this series, it's really one of the best shows running right now. I won't say THE best, far from it, but for a shounen especially, it's very good. It's not brainless and DBZ-ish like Naruto is becoming, and it's not a take on Bleach. It's entirely different, and in it's own way, brings something new to the shounen genre. \
Sure, some of the core ideas have been done, but where Soul Eater wins is on presentation, and that impossible-to-deny, genuine enjoyment factor. Just give it a try, you will not be disappointed. But make sure to watch it in HD, it really is worth it.",

    This was my first anime, and got me really into watching. It is quite suspenseful, but provides comic relief at the right times. I like how the story is not totally based on just one character/set of partners, and involves both in and out of school situations. The animation is nicely done, and each character has a distinctive personality. The whole storyline revolves around souls, which I find to be an interesting concept. The anime does not make any drastic changes from the original; it really brings the manga to life. \
The only thing that irked me was the ending. Yes, hope and just believing\
          \
        in general is great, and helps people get through harsh times. But who knew courage would end the whole battle that seemed so one-sided, by the hands of some small school-girl without a weapon? Wait, pardon me, it seems courage was her weapon. I don't know about other people, but the ending just didn't seem to fit quite well with everything the series led up to. \
Other than that, it is definitely an anime worth checking out. \

    Soul Eater is a good anime that i enjoyed watching quite a bit, but i did have a few problems with it here and there so let me break it down for you.\
*Story*7/10\
The story for this anime to me was like a ham sandwich were the being and end are the slices bread and the middle was the meat. But this sandwich has two pieces of bread that are completely different but the ham tastes very good. Also one of those slices of bread is missing a bite. I say this because at the being of the anime we are presented with a\
          \
        simple goal for the 3 main characters which is to collect souls. Then later (around episode 30)this goal completely disappears and it is never spoken of again or hinted to and our characters get a new goal which provides the good ham. The ham is very good and it lasts till the just about the last episode, but this is where that slice of bread that is missing a bit comes in. This is due to the fact that at the end of the series they do not wrap everything up. They attempt to wrap thing up during the ending credits but it goes by quick and leaves some questions unanswered. Also it leaves us with a feeling that this series could have continued  which equals part of that missing bite.\
*Art*8/10\
the art was average in most places it was clean and crisp. But in other areas the art would really stand out such as the death room as well as the art for moon and sun. Also the art for the character sid stuck out as well.\
*Sound*7/10\
the music was ok it did not add or take away anything from watching this series\
*Characters*10/10\
this is what this anime will be know for, because it truly has quite a colorful cast. From the mostly serious character such as Sid to the almost bugs bunny like Death they are all great. All of the characters in this anime are unique and stand out in their own regard which really gives you the felling that this could be a real community.\
************Overall*************8/10\
I really enjoyed watching this anime mostly because of the Characters.Even though the story may seen inconsistent as a whole it is worth watching because of the second half of it. So i would suggest that you go watch this anime right now it is on hulu right now with a unmarked expiration date.\

    Soul Eater, in one word amazing. From the very first episode you'll get to know the characters, start to feel with them and make them real in your head. the moves they make are very basic yet catching and sometimes surprising at the same time. They'll make you laugh, think, cry with them and make you fall in love with them (not literally of course xD)\
The story is really well developed, from the third episode you'll get caught by it. It starts with the character introductions where you start to understand the situation of the characters and their biggest weakness. After that introduction the real\
          \
        story begins. From there on I was taken by the story. You'll first meet the side characters and their importance in the story. Then slowely but surely you'll get to know the villain and the evil plot. The plot continues and everything starts to get together and develop further t to the climax. That's the point where the story goes down, the climax. At the very last episode you're enthousiasm gets knocked down by a cliché speach of good wins over evil. \
Even so the story was worth watching and made me eager to read the manga.\
The art of this anime is really awsome. It's different from the usual anime but nonetheless very good. The anime is of high quality and the animation is on a very high level. In contradiction of other animes such as Naruto, where the animation stars with a lot of mistakes and is a little messy, Soul Eater has a very strict yet magnificent art style. So I, being a big fan of animaitions and a very critical person when it comes to artstyles, give the art a well deserved ten.\
The sounds and music of this anime is what makes it whole. It is directed really good and gives the anime just that little extra touch it needs. The most interesting part are... or is (as they are actually the same) the pianoparts of Soul. It's not the kind of piano partiture you're likely to be used to, but it is actually composed really well, and definitely not something that could be taken out of the anime.\
I enjoyed this Anime the the max as it made every sense awake, and the overall view of the anime makes it one awesome whole\

    When i first saw the art work for Soul Eater i didn't find it very attracting and so i passed it over a couple times but the i finally sat down and watched the first episodes i was immediately hooked. The art work was very unique and soon i really started to something different from your typical Shounen anime. \
Now then allow me to say that the animated version of Soul Eater is pretty similar to the first anime of FMA.  Not quite so much as story line or setting but in the structure.  Both animes were awesome, funny, great characters and had\
          \
        good battle scenes.  But they both had to vary from the original manga story line and ended up in making their own endings for them.  Not to be too negative about it Soul Eater is an awesome anime.  They really brought the characters to life and made the battle scenes very enjoyable and i encourage you to at least watch the first 10 episodes of the anime and then decide if you want to continue or begin the manga, seeing as the manga is still ongoing.\
Lastly, i really love Soul Eater, both the anime and the manga and if you can i would suggest you read/watch both versions.  Although they do have a lot of similarities the anime still varies on certain large sections of the plot. \
               Hope you enjoy it as much as i did.\

    Soul Eater is for the time being my FAVORITE ANIME and is by far the BEST SERIES EVER! While Bleach and Naruto were being really GAY with fillers, Soul Eater completely filled in their spot. In time, I was waiting to watch this anime every week over the others. The concept is nothing like BLEACH like one of these guys mentioned. IN FACT, the concepts make MORE SENSE are more FUN and are actually consistent throughout. With anime, shinigami and shinobi can only be interpreted in so many ways before someone can relate one to another. \
OVERALL, its a 10 series for me. The story\
          \
        got a 9 only because of the 51 episodes that it had to limit itself to and it ended in a rather cliche way. There were parts of the story that I REALLY wanted to know more about. Though they explain everything, I was left wanting to know MORE! When it concluded I WAS SOOOOOO DEPRESSED. I STILL AM!!!!!!!!!!!\
I recommend this series to everyone I know. This is a MUST SEE for anyone who enjoys top quality weapon-action sequences (consistently WELL DONE throughout). As well as great imagination without overdoing it. \

    so this was a good series for me, but the end sucked so bad for this anime, I'm still joking about it two years later. I read the manga and was blown away by how good it was.  I was severely saddened when i caught up to the current issue, so im waiting day by day for the next chapter.\
It looks cartoonish and basically just for kiddies to me in the begining, but it definitely grows up and has some darkness as it goes on. the manga all together grows up faster, and is a bit older.  It seems kind of like the\
          \
        series is based on a main point, but you realize it goes further if you read the manga.\
It does the whole preachy thing where they good vs evil haracters will argue over ideals and each will give some speech that is totally lame, but it only happens a few times from what i remember\
its a good anime, but once you are introduced to arachnophobia, it goes down hill, i wouldn't reccomend it beyond that.  until then its great though\

The overall character development was good. The main characters of this anime have been portrayed really good. My favorite character being Stein. And pf course Shinigami's character was awesome. Rikiya Koyama did a great job voicing him.\

    I don't normally find myself writing a review for an anime unless it blows me away or disappoints me. Unfortunately, Soul Eater was the latter. Don't misunderstand me, this is not a terrible anime. What it does right, it does RIGHT. However, I want to still say this clearly:\
Soul Eater disappointed me to no end.\
The art and the fights are unique and worth watching. The setting is a fresh twist on your normal high school background. The characters, they're all very unique in personality, quirks, and weaponry. These things are done well. Really well. They deserve all the credit they can get.\
The flaws, however, really\
          \
        do shine. And I really don't know where to start.\
The characters, for all the uniqueness, are not all that developed. The main three (and their partners) are developed, but even they don't get too much character development. Meanwhile, any side character involved is pretty much introduced and completely forgotten about. That might seem to be an exaggeration, but there are so many highlighted side characters in this show that get ZERO background. They're just introduced at random and you're supposed to act as if you've known them from the beginning. Then, there are characters that have no real purpose even being in the anime (looking at you, Blair). They kinda just waste time. One kinda wastes whole episodes.\
The story is shallow. Very shallow. The show tries to emulate FMA Brotherhood a bit by setting up this overall evil plan, but it's no real mystique to it at all. They're constantly explaining everything aloud. The main villain is almost completely without substance as they barely speak.\
There's a lot of things that aren't expanded on at all, leaving a lot of loose threads in the end.\
And speaking of the end, it's just not remotely satisfying at all. The build-up to it was something that absolutely could not deliver no matter how hard they tried. A decent amount of it is cliche, another decent amount is contrived. It's generally forced.\
The most disappointing thing about the show for me is Soul himself, the titular character. He's the blandest character in the show. This is opinion, but I honestly can't tell you one particular thing about him. Like, he had some sort of big boob fetish for the first two or three episodes, but after that, he's just a character in the background of everything going on. They don't really explore his past in any way and he's not really involved in those slice-of-life moments that they have. It's especially weird because he has a unique character design and he is the one the show is named after. However, if they didn't make a note to name the show after him, I legitimately wouldn't ever think he was a major character.\
All in all, Soul Eater is too prideful. It takes so much pride in everything that it refuses to change. I mean that. When it's supposed to be dark, they'll stick to their goofiness. When things are supposed to be grave, everyone is taking it lightly. There feels like there are no stakes because the anime is trying extra hard to make it feel that way and I honestly can't understand why.\

    AH Soul Eater. I don't' know how many times I've started this show and given up on it. I must say I never read the manga so this is solely based on the anime\
In summary: take all the ingredients of a good shounen, mix them together, forget the spice and any additional flavoring such as salt and sugar and you get Soul Eater. A whole lot of good ideas but absolutely no soul into the characters that would suck you into the story.\
The first 3 episodes are an overly long introduction to all the characters... Why not introduce characters little by little along the course\

        of the story like in any other shounens I wonder? That was the first roadblock for me. I just couldn't get invested after 3 episodes. Never could get past the third.\
The second problem is that there is no overarching story. Basically, the two main characters Maka and Soul are trying to turn Soul into a super weapon to be used by the God of Death. That's pretty straightforward but there is absolutely nothing that makes us understand why they're so keen on him turning into that weapon. Same thing about Black Star, who's a parody of Naruto... except that Naruto is a likable idiot you want to cheer for and Black Star is an idiot. Period.\
The anime is also filled with quirky characters, except that it's just not funny. By trying too much to have characters who are \"out-of-the-ordinary\" well, it just feels forced and flat and annoying and it makes it difficult to empathize with any of them. To name one scene that stuck to mind for instance, in episode 25, after the not-resolution of a huge battle, we're introduced to new characters. One of them is a single woman whose dream is to stop fighting, get married and have a normal life. For I don't remember the reason, she decides her ideal partner is... a toilet. Yes the thing you sit on to do your business. She  goes into a soliloquy about how wonderful her new husband-to-be is and her friend tries with lots of energy to convince her that marrying an object in which you shit and pee isn't so good.\
THIS IS NOT FUNNY. THIS IS NOT RIDICULOUS. IT IS PA-THE-TIC... and that's one of many many lame jokes that won't even make you have a shadow of a smile.\
After about 10 episodes or so, we finally get some sort of great story arch, but by this time, the characterization still hasn't caught up. The narration feels also pretty confused. You get single episode with side characters who you really don't care about, mixed with meaningful ones. It's a Russian roulette each time you start a new episode: will this be a waste of time or not?\
After 26 episodes, we get a central conflict and, since I didn't get past episode 26, certainly something less convoluted, but by that time I just couldn't endure more especially because I'm way past the age when gratuitous fan-service just made my eyebrows shot upward. Now I just truly despise it, and my tolerance to big boobs goes in hand with the quality of the series. If it sucks don't expect me to have a high tolerance to your sexual frustrations on display. After all, I'm not doing a competition with other viewers here to see who has seen more animes, why did I stick that long?\
1. The art is top notch. The animation is great, the character design is pretty conventional but the overall backgrounds and small original touches here and there does give this anime a flavor of its own graphically speaking.\
2. The music is really really cool. I'm not a fan but it does fit the spirit of the series.\
3. It's Bones. Eureka Seven, Wolf's Rain and Fullmetal Alchemist among others... They just can't possibly make something that SUCKS entirely right? Well... there is a first to everything I guess.\
\
Personal advice: Don't be fooled by the cool music and the animation. Ultimately that's not what makes a good series. Good ideas have to be polished and refined and most importantly, no story with no characters. If the characterization sucks, even if the plot is okay it will leave you cold. Well the story's poor and the characters are a parody of everything that makes shounens great in the first place. Waste of time.\

    Gorgeous animation, beautiful colors, original characters, amazing story, fenominal voice acting in both Japanese and English, an all around amazing anime! If you like action, comedy, or supernatural anime, Soul Eater is perfect for you! Oh, and not to mention the incredible soundtrack, Soul Eater's opening is among the most popular anime openings of all time for a reason! This falls under my top 10 best anime of all time list for a reason (and I've seen a lot, trust me), mainly because of the awesome animation and the originality of the characters; I'm looking at you, Maka and Kid. Watch it if you like\

    Hi guys! This is my review for the Soul Eater anime!! \
\
Story 9/10: \
Well, this anime follows the young meister Maka Albarn and her Demon Scythe partner Soul Eater Evans. It also follows meister Black Star and his  Demon Weapon Tsubaki Nakatsukasa. And also Shinigami's son Death The Kid and his Demon Twin Guns Liz Thompson and Patty Thompson. The meisters have to try and get their Demon Weapons to become a Death Scythe by collecting 99 Souls that are on their way of becoming a Kishin and one Witch Soul. Now, I don't really like this story compared to the manga. But it's\
          \
        still very good. \
\
Art 10/10:\
The art is amazing. I really like how they did anything in it. It's kinda hard to explain the art. You will just have to watch the anime yourself to see how awesome it is! ^^\
\
Sound 10/10: \
I loved the music in this anime. There is only a few songs that I didn't like. You will have the same opening for about 30 or 34 episodes but it doesn't matter because it's awesome anyway. I just love the sound in this anime.\
\
Character 10/10:\
I love pretty much all of the characters in this anime. Good or evil, I love them. They were all pretty good written too. Their personality's fit their characters very well too.\
\
Enjoyment 10/10:\
I really loved this anime. One of the best ones I have seen. I enjoyed this anime a lot. And I'm sure you will too. But I do like the manga a whole lot better. It's still a good anime though.\
\
Overall 9/10:\
I gave it a 9/10 because well, I can't really tell you because it would be a spoiler. But like I said it's a really good anime. You need to watch it. If you don't, you will miss out on a good on. ;)",

    This anime was amazing! There is no doubting that.\
You start off in this anime thinking \"Oh, this is going to be another cheesy, annoying, mushy 'friendship bonds over come everything' kinda anime.\" Well, in the beginning you may be right. Then you start meeting the characters and actually getting to know them and their stories. THEN everything flips around. Personally I love the freaky, mind blowing, insanity stuff. This anime gets a piece of everything in it. Almost all genres were touched upon: romance, comedy, horror (slightly), supernatural (obviously), more than you can think of. The story line is original and each episode keeps you\
          \
        wanting more. \

    This is a fun one. In order to graduate from Death God school, a 2- (or 3-) person team of a wielder and a weapon (scythe) must work together to collect 100 souls from horrifying monsters.\
I have to say that Death the Kid (Death's son) was my favorite character, with his skateboard and his hilarious OCD for symmetry (hence his need for two sythes), and when he wasn't onscreen the action kind of dragged for me.\
Also, the humor wasn't always on par in my opinion—I wanted to just skip the two Excalibur-centric episodes before I stabbed my eyes and ears out.\
But the animation is crisp\
          \
        and attractive, the plotlines are clever, and—oh, who am I kidding, just watch it for Death the Kid (who comes in for episode 3). Also of interest is how the wielders and the sythes work together, the weird and almost marital relationships they form.",

    Soul Eater was my first anime ever! Therefore I will have have some bias.  I really enjoyed the series. I have laughed so hard that my sides hurt. The characters are amazing. They all have unique personalities traits that make them entertaining, and in some cases lovable. The characters interactions are the best part of the show. The art is not bad. It tends to have a cheesy quality to it, and they loved to over-exaggerate things. You cannot take Soul Eater seriously. There is not a whole lot of a intricate plot, but it is enough to get by and have fun. I\
          \
        suggest watching at least the first five episodes (free online) before you pass judgement on it. It might come off as a bit bizarre, so it might not be for you. But please give it a try. Otherwise you will be missing out!\

So my uncle has bugged me for such a long time to watch soul eater. So a couple months ago I finally decided to read the manga. I absolutely loved the manga! Definitely within my top ten. After I finished up with reading it, I started watching it the other day. I am VERY impressed on how close it is with the manga. I do notice some changes, but they are tiny. I would have to say this is the closest I have ever seen an anime to the original manga. (Although while looking for the author's name I found that the plots will diverge\
          \
        a little bit.) :( Like I mentioned earlier, in my top ten, so I am giving Soul Eater a 4.7 out of 5.\
[Story:4.8]\
 Pretty generic at times, and a tad predictable every so often, and yet they manage to make a great story. Plenty of conflicts that will stir your emotions. One of the biggest theme in this anime is friendship, so its a very heart warming manga most the time. This is a Shonen, so there is action to keep you awake. (I watch a lot of my anime at night.)\
[Art:4.8]\
I wish my art style looked like that. O.o Well mostly. I do want to be original I suppose. (Sorry off topic.) Anyways, great art. All of the character designs are very well thought out. The sun, moon, and clouds are very unique. One of my favorite parts of the whole anime. (I giggle every time I see the sun or moon.) xD\
[Ideology:4.9]\
There is a very unique system of meisters and weapons. (Bleach is kinda similar... But to try to compare them would be a long stretch.)  The concept of meisters and weapons is really fun and singular. (One person would be the meister and use the weapon, the other person would transform into a weapon to be used. The stronger their souls are connected the stronger they are in battle. People with bigger souls are more powerful. ect...)\

    Soul Eater is a stunning and admirable anime. The main goal that the characters have is to attend the DWMA (name of school) to collect 99 kishin souls and a witch soul. This, however is how the story begins. This storyline makes a change for the better. At first I was a bit unsure if I was going keep watching ,but if I had decided not to I would have missed out on the pure greatness I was going to watch. The characters Maka and Soul worked well as a team while the other main characters\": Black Star, Tsubaki, Death the Kid, Liz ,and Patty\
          \
        add more to the main plot as well as adding comedy to the anime. The way these characters get along and fight as well as overcome obstacles make these characters likeable in a way. The graphics in the anime appeared weird at first to me but eventually became quite comical. Especially how the sun and the moon had faces. The antagonist in this anime were pretty evil except the Asura the kishin towards the end of the anime. But Medusa and Arachne did put a main enemy/obstacle for the main characters to overcome. I did watch the anime in English dub witch I did prefer though I watch most of my animes in Japanese. Overall, I think this show is a MUST WATCH for all anime viewers. Soul Eater is a very enjoyable anime and I think anyone else who watches  will think so too.\

             Let me start with the bad: some gags really don't work with me, but they managed to find solid footing pretty fast. It suffers from the same problem as the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime, but instead of a whole season of filler we get a third a season. You'd think that's be a good thing, but the whole season FMA had allowed them to set up stuff so it kinda became it's own, complete, separate show from the manga. Soul Eater didn't, and the filler ending they cobbled together seems very patchwork. The worst has to\
          \
        be the ending, which makes no fucking sense, and does to nothing but leaving me staring at the screen in bewilderment. It really let me down, but with the advent of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and the two doing the same thing and being made by the same animation company, maybe we can get a similar show here.\
       So what's good about Soul Eater? So freaking much. First off, the action is gorgeous. And it don't mean in an animation or frame-rate sense, I mean it is just freaking amazing. I'd honestly have to say that Soul Eater has my favorite action scenes from anime. Also? The music. Both openings to the show are fantastic, and while I prefer the second one, both are up there in my favorite openings in anime. Also, I really like the cast. Mako and Soul are good protagonists; Kid and the Thompson Sisters are fun; and Black Star and Tsubaki are great. Plus, the side characters are great too. Krona is my favorite shonen rival, not counting Ryoga. His story is really well done, and I like the ending the filler bits actually gave him. (As opposed to the manga where his story tears my heart apart.) Dr. Stein is a great mentor character, and Maka's Dad is cool as well. Medusa is one of my favorite villains in recent anime. So, while it has a few flaws, Soul Eater ends up being one of my favorite anime to come out in recent yearsish. I'd heavily recommend it, and it isn't hard to find. The whole thing's one Netflix.\

    Review 3: Soul Eater (Funny, loud and crazy)???\
soul eater is an amazing action packed anime and manga about shinigami-sama and if you don't know who that is it's basicly death himself, he (surprisingly) runs the DWMA which standsfor The Deaths Weapon And Meister Academy, a meister is someone who can weild a weapon to match their soul waves and use the weapons in combat to destroy Kishin.\
The main characters;\
Maka: a young girl who is a weapon meister, in other words she can wield herself to other people who can trun into weapons. Her father is deaths weapon, her weapons name is soul. She doesn't have\
          \
        a mysterious past and is seen as a normal student at the DWMA.\
Soul: Soul is Makas weapon who is pretty laid back and care free guy until it comes to maka being hurt in combat. where i've gotten to in the episodes he doesn't seem to have a mysterious past of any sort and seems fairly normal. If something isn't \"cool\" as he says then he'll hate it.\
Black Star: A young boy who has a tendancy to be loud and very annoying, he acts just like an assasin who has no idea on how to keep quite during fights. His weapon, Tsubaki, has never mangaed to get even one soul because Black Star is always to loud and scares away the enemies. He seems to be normal at first but his past is soon revealed and is quite easy to understand.\
Tsubaki: A young teenage girl who has a bit of a confussing past behind her as her brother is the Demon sword. She has never managed to get even one soul because of Black Star, she is known as the only person compatible with Black Star as she is the only one who can put up with his craziness.\
Death The Kid: death the kid turns out to be Shinigami-Sama's son, he doesn't look anything like his father, mainly because his father has no form what so ever.......He has EXTREME OCD and everything has to obsolutely perfect otherwise he can't fight, he can't live and really wants to kill himself. he has an obsession with symmetry and has no mysterious past behind him.\
Liz & Patty: The twins that are Death The Kids weapons, they where born on to the streets and used each other as weapons, they used to rob people of there money and dignity. They tried to rob Death The Kid but he then took them in as his weapons and are now used as the twin guns. Patty is the youngest and liz is the oldest but patty is way better then liz!\
Dr.Stein: A weird doctor who eventually becomes a teacher at the DWMA, most of his lessons are based on disecting creatures that are almost extinct! He is crazy and his back side is usually stuck to a chair which can make the most serious situations funny in it's own way!\
i would recommend this to anyone who loves action packed anime and humour, theres loads of funny moments and parts that make you wish you was there! theres loads of other characters in Soul Eater that will make you laugh and cry at the same time, some characters you won't get to know for long, and in parts it make you wish that the characters where around for longer. This is an amazing series with lots of great characters that you'll love! And enemies you will grow to hate even more then the first time you saw them!\
i love this series and so should everyone else!!!!!!!\

    hello everybody im kirk smith and today im reviewing soul eater.in soul eater when somebody dies \
there soul becomes visaboul as a small blue ball of energy and if the soul is it gives the comsumer more power and when \
someone has eaten an innocent soul then there soul becomes a kishen egg and needs to be reclaimed.to help him keep the \
peace the grim reaper aka lord death opened an acadamy to train misesters and weapons.a misester is a who wields the \
weapon and a weapon is a person that can transform into a weapon.it is the job of the misester to kill people\
          \
        whos soul \
have become kishen eggs and feed the souls to there weapon,once a weapon has eaten 99 kishen eggs and 1 witches soul,once \
that is done the weapon can become a death sythe,once a weapon is a death sythe he becomes a personal weapon for lord death.\
there are 7 main charecters,sythe miseter maka and her weapon soul eater evans,dark arts master black star and weapon\
tsubacki,tsubacki is a speacail weapon and has 4 weapon forms,she can become a dagger,a huge shurikken,a smoke bomb,\
and a chain linked dual weilded mini sythe,later in the series she can a 5th form but in not spoiling it,the final main \
chareter and fan favorite,lord deaths son,death the kidd or kidd,kidd is a grim reaper and has two weapons,lix and patty \
are the thomson sisters and they can transform into twin pistols.kidd wanted them because he has OCD for symmetery and \
having the two preserves symmetery.alright now at the start of the series the plot is that these students are trying to \
turn there weapons into death sythes but that is quickly forgotten as they have to stop someone from reawaking a kishen \
that is trapped under the acadamy.i did like this series but it did have its faults the ending is very anticlimatic,and \
it was just a bad ending also spioler no one becomes a death sythe,that was the whole piont of the show at the start and it\
irritated me how no became a death sythe and i would have liked some more charecter developement.now the art style is  \
different in terms of the colors are more illuminate and the are art looks like something tim burtin would have drawn.\
the she has a good bit of comedy in it as well as action and if u can understand japanese the show has a lot of doouble\
meanings and is much funnier in japanese.as far as fan service goes soul eater does have some but no more than any other\
anime and its always used for humor.the soundtrack is like a mix of rock and hip hop and goes very well with with the \
action scenes and the opening is one of the best ive ever seen in an anime.ok now sub or dub,in my opinion both have ups \
and downs when kidd has his OCD freak outs i prefer dub but i prefer his subbed voice regularly i like soul and spirt in \
the dub and maka and black star more in the sub,so its just personnal preference.all and all i give this anime a 6 out of \
10,it would have scored higher if not for the bad ending and the turn around of the original story.\
thanks for watching and leave acomment or email us for any anime you want us to review.\

    I really wanted to give this a better score, but I just couldn't because of some of the flaws. Like sometimes from the end of an episode to the next one didn't really seem to fit together, its kind of like they just showed up to that place and you really have no idea what's going on, but this happens only a few times, and isn't really that bad, but I just thought o would give a heads up about it. The first 24 or so episodes were great, but I feel the next episodes didn't really seem to fit with the first 24ish episodes,\
          \
        and that's just me.\
May contain spoilers\
So at first we see maka and her blade, soul. And they attack corrupted souls and then the weapon or soul eats the soul and when you get 100 of these souls the weapon turns into a deathscythe and seems to be more powerful, they didn't explain much of the powers you receive when you turn into a deathscythe. So know what? Do they go around trying to get more souls? Nope. They attacked a false witch to get the 100th soul, because you need a witches soul for the last one, and then they reset to 0, and this happens within the first 2 episodes I think. And the show then turns into maka and soul making friends in their school and face many enemies among they way, in the first 24 episodes there is a witch that is trying to revive the demon god, and we see what she does and how she tries to revive the demon god. Then after the demon god is revived things seem to go downhill, we meet new enemies who we don't know much of, and the witch takes over a kid, and the witch is now a kid, and I'm not sure what the goal is in the second half of the show, is the demon god trying to get revenge? The demon god just kind of sat around until the last episodes, and he got way to easily I thought. There is my say on the story, not the best but I liked it nonetheless, the characters were good, some were annoying, some were cool, some were strong, and some were weak. They are all well developed and get a good view on each of their personalities. I loved both of the openings, they were good songs and good videos, fit the show very well. Endings were good also. Animations and art were good, animations were good during fights, very fluid. Art was decent on the characters, some people looked unrealistic but overall good job there. \
Now while the story wasn't the best, the fights were really good, non repetitive movements, animations were high up there, soundtrack was really good, good character list, some might be annoying to some viewers. Those things definitely make up for the weak storyline, and make it quite enjoyable for some people. I did actually enjoy it, so don't let my review of the story turn you away. If I were on the edge of watching this, I wouldn't waste another second, I would watch it right away\

    Everything about the anime was great. I loved how the anime started with showing the 3 characters separately and showing us some of their skills and a bit of their background story.Black Star is my favorite. Death The Kid is hilarious and I love his dialogue when it comes to defeating the enemies and protecting his friends. And I totally fell in love with the anime even further when the main characters came together on missions and interacted socially with each other. But the thing about it is after I watched the anime I was a bit dissapointed with how the anime ended? Maka all\
          \
        of a sudden being the one to save the day by doing a weak attack against the enemy. Thats lame. So I went and read the manga and their ending was incredible. So the anime is just like the manga except the ending is different. That's why the ending sucks. \

    OVERALL:\
     Soul Eater is a great anime, but cut short at 51 episodes. Despite its rushed ending, but the ride is well worth it. Also, it would seem that its creators favor and look forward to the idea of making more seasons, getting back on track with the manga's storyline, which was also requested by fans.\
PROS:\

    I just recently finished watching soul eater, I would say it is something like one piece characters using bleach fighting techniques, more or less. The story has quite a fast pace and it does not seem very well developed either.However, I really did like the action as it was a appropriately-timed and  balanced fight between the characters, and the stage was also perfect.The comedy aspect of the series isn't bad either. Also, it isn't  centralized around the soul eater, who claims to be cool throughout the series( I didn,t find him any cooler than the rest of the characters). \
Overall, I will rate\
          \
        the anime above average.You wouldn't regret watching it. Though I still don't get their kind of  \"soul society\" , a breathing sun and a grinning moon. It is creepy. You just might get a good Halloween costume by watching this anime\

    The animation is very unique. It is a very entertaining series, but do not expect a concrete ending. You will have to follow the story by reading the manga since alot of the character development is left in the air. Its a shame since the character design in the series is very appealing. It seems like they wanted to cover too much in the animation and forgot to work more with some of the most important characters, like Maya and Soul, for example. However, they still find the time to stick in those annoying Excalibur filler episodes.Arg!\
 Overall, this is a fun series to watch.\
          \
        It fits the time, reminds you of the \"in\" series right now, like Bleach and Naruto, and the universal mainstream appeal of the \"school for special powers\" setting like Harry Potter's Hogwarts. \
Very \"hip\" and \"cool\" series. Regardless of the typical storyline, I believe that the series has its own personality and creativity. The art is total eye candy with bright colors and pleasant animation. Also,the opening theme is great! \

Because of the visual I thought that was just a shounen like the others, but actually this have a pretty good history, the characters are funny and the dialogues are deep sometimes. \

 Black☆Star (ブラック☆スター, Burakku☆Sutā) is one of the main Meisters that the series follows. Black Star is one of the survivors of the infamous Star Clan, The other being Akane☆Hoshi. Which explains why Black Star has a star on his shoulder. His Demon Weapon partner is Tsubaki Nakatsukasa. He is a Shadow Weapon Meister (暗器職人 Anki Shokunin in Japanese) which is translated into Dark Arm Meister in the English dub. Currently, he is a Two-Star Meister and a member of the elite student unit, Spartoi. \
 \
 He is the descendant of a powerful and deadly assassin White Star, who Mifune fought previously. Like White Star, Black Star always holds a grudge, namely against Mifune, who beat him up twice previously. He eventually is overcome by anger and goes after Mifune, and wins, but harnesses his anger (simultaneously mastering Tsubaki's enchanted sword mode) and defeats Mifune fair and square.\

      lastname = "Death the Kid",
      description = "Classification: Immortal, Shinigami, Meister \
 He is Patricia \"Patti/Patty\" Thompson's and Elizabeth \"Liz\" Thompson's Meister and Death's son. He was born from a fragment of Shinigami's soul.\
 \
 Being the son of Shinigami, Kid was singled out. The other students at Shibusen were afraid to get close to him not only because he was Shinigami's son, but because they were afraid that they'd get hurt. This continued until he became the meister of Liz and Patti. They became good comrades, and even helped Kid. Kid didn't, necessarily, experience friendship until he met the others. He is really grateful to have friends that are not afraid of him like the others at Shibusen.\
 \
 Kid has obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, or OCPD, which is manifested as an obsession over perfection. Objects and surroundings that are symmetrical can distract him from missions, and he will usually start to break down and have fits if he notices asymmetrical objects around him. Thus if anything is wrong by any measurement (a picture frame crooked, or not folding his toilet paper, for example), he will try to correct it right away, even at the cost of the mission at hand. He is so obsessed with symmetry that Kid refuses to fight a battle unless everything is symmetrical, as he would be asymmetrical holding only one gun. Even if an enemy is symmetrical in appearance, he will refuse to fight it and harm its symmetry. The fact that the left half of his bangs is marked with three white stripes causes him much stress. As a result of his OCPD, Kid can be very hard on himself if the asymmetry of the stripes in his hair are pointed out by someone, calling himself \"useless asymmetrical garbage\". Kid, trying to make himself completely symmetrical, tried to dye his hair once, but the Sanzu Lines continued to reappear. This is because his reaper body rejects all forms of chemicals and toxins, including artificial coloring like hair dye. The Index of the Book of Eibon referred to this obsession as Madness of Order.\
 \
 His favorite number is 8, not only for its symmetry, but for the fact it divides out evenly. An example of one of his fits, and his love for the number 8, can be shown when he met Soul on his first day of DWMA. When Soul said that if Kid had arrived at 7 like he was suppose to he could look around himself. Instead of focusing on the entire comment.. Kid replied \"  \"No, it can't be seven! Say eight, dammit! Eight is better! It's physically impossible to cut the number seven in half and make it symmetrical! It has to be eight instead! Eight cut vertically or horizontally stays perfectly symmetrical! Take it back, I beg of you! Please say eight! Please!\", only to become further distressed when Black Star broke one of the spikes tips jutting out of his fathers, perfectly symmetrical, school.\
 \
 Despite that his father wears a completely asymmetrical cloak, Kid is not bothered by it at all, being that his love for his father outweighs his OCPD. He also doesn't seem to mind that his Death God Martial Art- \"Stance of Sin\" requires him to hold his arms in asymmetrical position. Showing that there are some things he can tolerate.\
 \
 He is usually very mature and precise in his ways. Kid is naturally calm and collected, and as such is perfectly fine with other people making their own decisions when it comes to symmetry or otherwise, even if he disagrees with their choices. However, there are times when his obsession with symmetry can greatly affect his usually calm personality and cause him to break down into childish fits.\
 \
 Due to his serious personality, Kid is unaffected by nudity. While other male characters get nose bleeds, Kid does not. During a battle with a female \"madness clown\" who was trying to distract Kid with her nearly naked body, Patti says, \"Kid-kun is one of those perverts that gets distracted only when you make him rub your breasts! This won't affect him!\", but isn't actually because he is not a pervert, and is more matured than boys his age. Considering Patti is not the smartest person in the world she would think like this. When Kid had to return to DWMA, in order to get back to the fight on the moon sooner, Kid had no problems walking in the girls bathroom to help, only to be dragged out by Liz. Later in the Death Room, Kid is shown to have blood coming out of one side of his nose and mouth, having been punched by either Liz or Kim.\
 \
 Of course, Kid's being unaffected by nudity may also be the result of being A-Sexual. Given that his father created both him and Asura A-sexually, and Shinigami shows no interest in either gender, even when Spirit hired Blair and her friends to entertain them during their meeting, he showed no interest and was rather confused by their flirtation and later angry at them for goofing off when they should be discussing the rescue of his son. An example to prove this is when Kid had visited Soul and Maka's apartment, when Blair's towel fell off instead of getting a nosebleed like Soul or Black Star, Kid looked rather disgusted.\
 \
 He doesn't seem to have any problem socializing and genuinely cares for his friends. He is seen expressing concern about Soul's scar at one point, and threatens Gopher that he will never forgive him if he hurts Maka after Gopher threatens to hurt her in revenge for their original fight. He also threw Patti and Liz away from him before being sucked into the Book of Eibon, not wanting them to be taken with him.\
 \
 Kid generally seems to be somewhat introverted, often working on missions on his own and not having as close of a friendship with Maka or Black☆Star as Maka and Black☆Star have with each other.\
 \
 It is mentioned by Maka that it is normally hard to match soul wavelengths with more than one weapon, but Kid as a highly skilled Meister is able to do so since Liz and Patti have a strong connection with each other and admiration for Kid who gave them a better life.\
 \
 His father, Death, has mentioned that Kid is a Shinigami (\"death god\") and does not need to collect souls, but Kid says he wants to make a weapon of his own specifications. His father also says that since he uses two weapons and the guns do not count as a set, he will have to collect twice as many souls: 198 evil human souls and two Witch souls instead of 99 souls and one witch soul. However, he seems perfectly fine with this.\
 \
 Kid shares a side rivalry with Black☆Star, and seems to be stronger, however it is possible that he is more susceptible to madness than Black☆Star or Maka, for both were able to pull themselves from madness while he quickly succumbed to the Madness of Order in the Book of Eibon, while Black☆Star is able to quickly snap himself out of it. This may be because of his OCPD, or simply because of his strong drive to create a perfect world. It is also possible that being a Shinigami, Kid was weaker against the Madness.\
 \
 Although Kid's obsession with symmetry often hinders his performance and focus on missions, he still has good intentions. He wants to follow in his dad's footsteps and help make the world a more peaceful place that is safe from evil.\

It was shown that Dr. Stein turned him into a zombie and thus was targeted by the Maka and Black Star's teams as part of their remedial lessons.

Since then, Sid acts as a spy to get information on the witches and their plans. He constantly talks about how he has always been \"that kind of man\" (when he was alive) and the things he could not do when he was alive but now can since he's a zombie. During his time when he was alive, Sid was a three star meister and a knife meister. His job was taken over by Dr. Stein.

 Compulsive Burial: Sid activates Soul Resonance with Nygus, then stabs her (in knife form) into the ground which causes coffins to appear below a person and act as an escape route. This technique creates a simple way of escape by the means of an escape tunnel going directly downwards.\

Crona is a very naive and submissive person who is constantly pestered by Ragnarok in the form of noogies and threats to eat their share of food. Crona does not like to fight but Medusa normally introduces a spell into their mind that increases their aggression. Crona's blood has been entirely replaced with 'black blood' which both protects them from physical harm and provides a degree of healing. Ragnarok, originally a normal weapon, was melted into the black blood before the transfusion, which causes their siamese nature. Crona is taking trial courses at Shibusen so they learn the proper way of a meister. Crona is trying to adapt to interacting with more people which may take some time because of Medusa's abusive treatment of them. Often, Crona stays in a corner of any room they are in and will cower in said corner if they are feeling nervous. Crona doesn't know how to interact with others, but is slowly learning how to, thanks to Maka. Maka can easily tune in to Crona's soul wavelength to understand and calm them when needed.\

However, no one can put up with its personality (it has a bigger ego than Black Star). The only reason that those who use it are called heroes is that they can put up with its annoying habits, such as a list of one-thousand things he demands to be completed, such as daily five-hour reading sessions. Excalibur was first introduced when Kid and Black Star found a book about him and thus sought him out, only to discover that the book had in fact been written by Excalibur himself. They quickly ditched him due to his personality. His other form is completely the opposite given his elegant weapon form, looking like a cartoon-ish gentlemen with an outrageous mustache and no pants. On the other hand, his legendary powers have been proven by a fellow Shibusen student who found completing the appointed tasks easy. Excalibur can grant great power, light speed and teleportation, and the wielder can easily defeat three of Shibusen's strongest combined. In the end, Excalibur was put back again because the student could not put up with his annoying sneeze. His existence throughout the story is purely comical, with the exception of the fact of how he informed Kid, the Thompsons, Buttataki, and Blair about the story of Eibon, backed by Shinigami.  \

She poses as a teacher and a nurse at Shibusen so she has access to all the students files. While in disguise, she acts like a very supportive person to hide her true nature. She stays at Shibusen to study the students to see which ones can become kishin (demon gods). Medusa is willing to use anyone and everyone to further her plans by any means necessary (even as far as planting snake bombs in her fellow witches bodies so they would cooperate with her). She can use them without dropping her soul protection, which allows her to not be discovered by others. Her personality is similar to Dr. Stein as she sees everyone and everything as an experiment. Her animal theme is snakes due to her magic, clothes, and that she constantly chants \"Nake snake cobra cobubra\". She has thousands of snakes in her body ready to do her bidding. She engaged in an intense battle with Dr. Stein in the lowest level of the school to allow the awakening of the first kishin. While she initially had the upper hand, her momentary pleasure at Asura's successful resurrection allowed Stein to slice her in half. Making one final attack and claiming to love him, he skewered her through the skull and her body evaporated. However, a snake decorated with Medusa's arrow markings was seen escaping the city through a drainpipe on the outskirts, most likely her transformed. Medusa has now been proven to still be alive, having possessed a cute little girl called Rachel. After getting her hands on the legendary artifact \"BREW\", leads a group of Shibusen students in an attack against a fellow witch — her older sister Arachne. \
 Magic: Her magic attacks in the form of snakes and uses the concept of vectors (directions).\
 \
 * Vector Arrow: Sends arrow headed snakes to pierce the enemy. (follows Medusa's hands)\
 * Vector Bullet: An arrow appears on the ground that will send anything on it in the direction that Medusa desires; propelling herself towards the enemy to engage in close combat (against Dr. Stein and Crona), propelling an attacker away from her, and quite possibly moving inanimate objects like chairs, tables, etc., turning them into deadly projectiles. Also known as Vector Plate in the anime and some translations.\
 * Serpent Whip: Medusa extends one of her snakes to strike from afar. Known as Light Serpent in the anime.\
 * Steam Vector: This attack surrounds Medusa with her Vector Arrows making a spinning tornado like shield. Called Vector Storm in the anime.\
 * Snake Bomb: Places a snake from her body into someone else; it will only detonate when she gives the signal.\
 * Vector Boost: A magic that doubles the power drawn in the direction of the arrow.\

His main function is to act as a mount for Eruka, using his large size and capability to fly to aid his master in whatever way possible. However, Otama Jackson has very low stamina, and cannot fight at all, making him easily exhausted and extremely vulnerable to attack.\
 \
 Unlike other Witches with their familiars the two seem to share a close friendship with each other despite Eruka's apparent dominant role in the relationship, with even the normally docile Eruka reprimanding Free after he only slightly injures Jackson. Jackson in turn is extremely loyal to Eruka, going so far as to help pass her the needle of Black Blood that is supposed to reawaken Asura before Black Star can get at it, resulting in the tadpole getting beaten up by Black Star. Eruka laments over this, and decides to fulfill the mission solely for Jackson's sake.\

He seems to really like being with children since he blushed at the thought after Tsubaki suggested that he could be a teacher at Shibusen.

 Attacks: His attacks center around his Infinite One-Sword Style. He uses the blunt side of the sword if he has to fight children, first shown in the first fight he had with Black Star. However, he may also use his swords by throwing them into the ground and using them as platforms to travel across.\
 \
 Start Up: Not an attack but more like the signal for Mifune of the start of the fight by throwing his case of swords into the air then letting stick into the ground, surrounding his enemy and himself with swords thus giving Mifune an near unlimited amount of swords to use. \
 \
 Three Shining Paths: Mifune will grab then throw three swords at the enemy.\
 \
 Addition Blows (1-12 Blows): Mifune moves at high speeds to attack his enemy. After each hit he will let go of his sword to quickly use another to let him attack from different angles while his enemy is stunned from his previous blow. This leaves his enemy covered with twelve swords.\
 \
 Multiplication Twenty Four Blows: Mifune will follow his Addition Blows with this attack. He strikes the swords that he left around his enemy from his Addition Blows which ends up cutting his enemy with the twelve swords all over again. \

 Forms: Mosquito's body changes to the way it was at an earlier age to fight.\
 -100 years ago: The muscles in his upper body enlarge, giving him the appearance of a huge gorilla-like torso. His legs however, remain unchanged. This form is Mosquito's toughest form and has been seen used twice.\
 -200 years ago: His limbs and nose extend in length, giving him a streamline, feline body structure. This form was when Mosquito was the fastest, evasive and had his nose most lengthened. This form was revealed partially when the Shibusen students had just defeated Mosquito's first form and when fighting Death the Kid and Free.\
 -400 years ago: In this form, with his soul wavelength swells up enormously, he takes up the shape of a young man with slick, combed hair. He is able to construct and reconstruct his body from bat-shaped darkness, and was able to sever one of Kid's arms and Free in half in barely one second. This form was when he was at his most numerous-Legion.\
 -800 years: This form has only been mentioned.\

 Attacks: Mosquito uses his needle nose for attacking, any other attacks depend on the form he is using.\

 -Three Piece Police Stringer: A more powerful version of the Police Stringer but it attacks three times.\

It loves to degrade and pester Chrona (even during fights) by giving him noogies, pinching his nose, hitting him on the head, or taking his food. When Chrona finally tells Ragnar&ouml;k to stop, Ragnarok seems surprised at his reaction. Ragnar&ouml;k has taken to absorbing any soul, evil or not. By taken innocent souls, Ragnar&ouml;k soul wavelength has grown out of control and vastly overpowers Chrona's own wavelength, which will lead to Ragnar&ouml;k soul eating Chrona's soul in the end. Later on, Ragnar&ouml;k can change its appearance to that of a dragon to give Chrona wings to fly vastly increasing Chrona's combat capablilties. It can also grow a mouth on its sword form that draws souls to it by using a high pitched scream. Then Ragnar&ouml;k absorbs the souls, using the mouth like a vacuum. Also, while screaming in its sword form, Ragnar&ouml;k acts like an electric saw due to the vibrations caused by its screaming. Ragnar&ouml;k can control Chrona's black blood (due to consuming innocent souls) when it leave Chrona's body. It can use the blood spilled from Chrona's body to make spikes to attack anyone or can cause the blood to stop and act like a bandage for Chrona so it does not pass out from blood loss. When not in use, Ragnar&ouml;k resides in Chrona's body, further tainting his blood and also allowing him to control Chrona's blood, Ragnar&ouml;k commented that Maka's soul looked delicious. Whether Ragnar&ouml;k can actually see souls has yet to been seen. He does worry about Chrona's health and will try to help Chrona by stopping his bleeding wounds. However, Ragnar&ouml;k will always ask for thanks afterwards. After the fight with Maka Ragnarok had all his souls confiscated which resulted in him shrinking greatly in size (he now resembles a chibi form of himself) he is also slightly perverted since when Chrona finally stood up to him he acted like an understanding guy while at the same time pulling up Chrona's dress, also he lifted Maka's skirt and commented on her dull choice of panties. Even with less power he still wants to eat any soul he sees, he also tends to us Chrona as a human shield against non-deadly attacks like the Maka Chop. \
 Attacks: His attacks mostly concentrate using Chrona's blood and causing mass destruction.\
 \
 Blood Spike: Changes the drops of Chrona's blood into spikes to attack from multiple angles.\
 Screech Resonance: Ragnar&ouml;k's equivalent of Soul Resonance.\
 Jet Black Sword: a more powerful form of Ragnar&ouml;k's sword form.\

He was also the most powerful technician to ever graduate from the school, Shibusen. He has a bolt going through his head which turns so his thoughts would be on the matter at hand. He mostly moves by pushing his chair in the direction he wants to go even if it ends up with him crashed on the floor. Stein is such a strong fighter that he could take down Black Star while still seated in his chair. Stein sees everything in the world, including himself, as an experiment or specimen. He even experimented on Spirit (now Death Scythe) when he was sleeping during the five years they worked together. His understanding of soul wavelengths gives him a huge advantage against other users since he can change his own to match the other&rsquo;s wavelength and thereby nullify or disrupt the soul frequency of the technician and weapon. This comes from his high spiritual flexibility and by observing his opponent beforehand. His soul wavelength is so high that he doesn&rsquo;t need a weapon and can channel it through his body and release it out of his body as electric discharge. He has a strange hobby of wanting to dissect anything he thinks is interesting. He is also the school doctor; he still respects Spirit and still calls him Senpai. \
 Other than his electric charges, he uses a repertoire of other techniques such as Soul Sutures, a technique which binds people to e.g. the ground via a soul wavelength (the technique is costly, it requires so much attention the wielder cannot move), Witch Hunter (the technique Maka uses) when he is using Spirit as a weapon, and the ability to cancel out direct soul attacks by matching wavelengths (explained earlier).\

 He goes crazy after the Kishin is released and madness wavelengths overwhelm him. Medusa takes advantage of this and takes him under her wing. \
 Marie saves him, by using her healing wavelength.\

  synopsis = "Death City is home to the famous Death Weapon Meister Academy, a technical academy headed by the Shinigami—Lord Death himself. Its mission: to raise \"Death Scythes\" for the Shinigami to wield against the many evils of their fantastical world. These Death Scythes, however, are not made from physical weapons; rather, they are born from human hybrids who have the ability to transform their bodies into Demon Weapons, and only after they have consumed the souls of 99 evil beings and one witch's soul. Soul Eater Evans, a Demon Scythe who only seems to care about what's cool, aims to become a Death Scythe with the help of his straight-laced wielder, or meister, Maka Albarn. The contrasting duo work and study alongside the hot headed Black☆Star and his caring weapon Tsubaki, as well as the Shinigami's own son, Death the Kid, an obsessive-compulsive dual wielder of twin pistols Patty and Liz. Soul Eater follows these students of Shibusen as they take on missions to collect souls and protect the city from the world's threats while working together under the snickering sun to become sounder in mind, body, and soul.
