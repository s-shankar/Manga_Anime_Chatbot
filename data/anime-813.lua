    Dragon Ball Z is epic. No doubt this is one of the most popular series that helped spread the art of anime in the world. \
The original Dragon Ball was fun, but in DBZ the characters have grown and the maturity is felt throughout the whole series. From the incredible Sayian Saga, an important Frieza Saga and the entertaining Cell Saga to the Grand Finale - Buu Saga, DBZ does not disappoint. It's not all about the fighting, although the series have probably 4-5 battles that should be written in the anime history books. I was always astonished by the character development which is amazing\
          \
        and to emphasize this, I like the example of Vegeta. He was one of the greatest villains at first and one of the greatest heroes in the end. The way Akira Toriyama changed his perspective throughout the storyline and how he did not rush Vegeta's judgement of his surroundings is astounding. Goku's naive greatness and Vegeta's indestructible pride completes, arguably, the single greatest friendship in anime history. \
Still not impressed? Just watch the final DBZ battle. It is grand, it is electric, it is emotional and atmospheric. When two of the most beloved fighters, Goku and Vegeta, stand against the mightiest villain in an empty planet, when the last hope is on their shoulders, when the price of failure will erase everything that is worth living for, they look at the situation and smile: this is how life is supposed to be. A man without a challenge is a man who does not live.   \

    If you're like me, the name Dragon Ball Z gets your blood boiling, your erection throbbing, and your bicep muscles pulsating. Contrary to popular belief, this is not because of some terrible medical condition or permanent damage from anabolic steroids. This is because the amount of manliness contained in just one episode of DBZ is enough to cause penis growth, beard hair, and possibly cancer. Make no mistake, this is not an anime for children or people on high blood pressure medication. Like Hank McCoy's premature big-foot vaccine, watching Dragon Ball Z is guaranteed to turn you into a badass gorilla with the strength of\
          \
        10 men and the swag of Carlos Santana. Yes, ladies and gentleman, this is a show for men and men only. If you don't have the balls to handle the sheer Nagasaki imploding intensity, the tear wrenching drama, or the mindblowing plot twists Dragon Ball Z has up its sleeve, you need not apply, lest you're prepared to have your face literally melted off in a fit of testosterone-fueled rage. For those that are confident that they're prepared, slide the car seat back and hold onto your testicles because this show is no fucking joke.\
You've no doubt heard others poke and make fun at this show's various idiosyncrasies. Next time someone tells you that the plot of the show is \"stupid and cliche\", or that the \"fight scenes drag on forever\", get them into an armbar and make them beg for mercy because they just told you a goddamn lie straight to your face. Dragon Ball Z is, in reality, the beautifully paced, glorious tale of a group of proud men defending their universe from a rotating cast of bombastic douchebags. I don't even think its physically possible to not shed manly tears sometime during this show; the sheer passion of our heroes is magnificent enough to inspire Kim Jong Il to build a refuge camp with his bare hands. Did I mention that DBZ is probably one of the most engrossing anime ever written? From Goku beating the unintimidating, girl-like cackling out of Frieza and his loser henchmen, to the inspirational choreography and edge-of-your-seat action of the Cell vs. Hercule Satan battle, to the powerful and emotionally enveloping transformation of Gohan from boy to man, you might as well just cut your fucking legs off now because you're not going anywhere for the next 200 episodes. Sure, there are dull moments, but they're few and far between the literal hours of pulsating shin muscles, constant character revivals, hyperbolic time chamber training montages, explosive physical transformations, special beam cannons, and more. Those who are trained in martial arts, like myself, will appreciate the painstaking accuracy put into every move of every fighting style these characters make. Watching DBZ is like watching a real life martial arts tournament---it's that realistic. Childhood obesity? What the fuck is that? Plop their little asses in front of the TV, pop this into the DVD player and watch those pounds literally melt away. Total Gym? Fuck your Total Gym.\
The artwork is VIP as fuck. Okay, let's be honest here, the backgrounds and environments are pretty consistently reused, and still shots and other cheap, corner cutting animation tricks are abound and noticeable, but the beauty in DBZ's art is in its action sequences and its character designs. The fight scenes (and there are plenty of them) are absolutely astonishing. We're not just talking fists here either---guns, swords, energy balls the size of pluto, it's all here and its all glorious through and through. Unlike shows that blow their budget upfront and are left with a crayon and two sharpies to finish out the series, DBZ's art actually gets better as time goes on. This is especially present in the aforementioned character models, who start off as beefy, badly proportioned messes and end up even beefier as the show progresses. However, this beefiness is what makes the character designs so goddamn cool. Everyone in this show has muscles---no exceptions. Women, children, even the fucking plants will flex a bicep here and there. Despite this, there aren't really any generic looking characters among the bunch. They have that signature Toriyama look which is always a plus, especially when compared to character models nowadays that all look like they were drawn to please yaoi fangirls, and everyone has their own distinct style even when they're wearing the same clothes. The hairdos? Holy shit, I think they brought actual salon stylists into the studio and told them to draw the stupidest fucking hair styles they could think of, because on real people this would look absolutely godawful. Luckily for us, what looks dumb on real people fits anime characters perfectly because without the signature outrageous hair this show would probably be boring as hell.\
The music? I'm not going to lie to you. It's fucking terrible. I've never heard a worse mix of shitty techno rock in my life. It never stops playing either, even in scenes where there's absolutely no reason for it to be on. From what I understand the Japanese dub and the English dub actually have separate soundtracks, so I'm guessing this has more to do with Funimation being a bunch of faggots than anything else. But seriously, who the hell did you bring in to perform this trash? Trent Reznor? It sounds like someone recorded me taking a shit and then put it to a drum loop they made in 3 minutes in FL Studio 10. I mean, they do an okay job actually pairing the music together with the animation but the music itself just doesn't fit the show. Maybe if this was like, Texhnolyze, or a German porn flick or something then yeah I could see the thought process. But why would you put it in DBZ? It perplexes the shit out of me. Now, as for the OP, that's a whole different beast. Anyone who's heard Rock the Dragon, even just once, will never be able to forget it. This would be great if the song didn't suck complete balls. Now, the in-show music may be outrageously bad, but Rock the Dragon takes \"shitty\" to another level. Even when I was a kid I thought this song blew. I'm not one to spit on a genuine effort, but I'm sorry, when you played that back to yourselves in the studio after recording it, how could you possibly look at yourselves and go, \"that sounds acceptable enough to be released to the public\"? How could you listen to DRAGON DRAGON HUMP THE DRAGON DRAGON BALL ZZZZZZZ, even once, and think to yourself, \"this is good\"? I don't get it. Sure, the ED isn't much to write home about either, but this eclipses everything else in some sort of disgusting tidal wave of mullets and trashy rock music. When I hear this song, my mind doesn't start pumping me up for DBZ, it starts conjuring images of meth labs and trailer parks because that's probably where this song was recorded. Usually when I bring up the OP to guys who saw the show as a kid, they go \"aww yeah that song makes me wanna fight somebody.\" Well, if that happened, not only would you lose, but the guy who mopped your shit would take your wallet and perform some hardcore identity theft on your ass just to spite you for making him listen to such a terrible song.\
On a more positive note, the English dub is phenomenal, especially in comparison to the vastly inferior Japanese dub. The English dub makes our heroes sound like a band of courageous warriors fighting gloriously for the good of all man-kind. It's excellent in every way possible. The Japanese dub makes them sound like a bunch of losers going through puberty. It's atrocious and offensive and just thinking about it sends me into a fit of rage, so let's move on.\
Now, we all know that DBZ has some of the most classic characters ever seen in anime history, and anyone who disagrees with this scientifically proven fact is a lunatic and a hater. Sure, some DBZ characters are leagues better than others, but you can't legitimately expect every character to be as mindblowingly badass as Hercule Satan or Vegeta or Piccolo. Still, what's great about DBZ is that despite this there's really no outright bad characters in the bunch, even amongst the villains who are kind of assumed to be somewhat shitty. Sure, Frieza was a little pretentious, but it only served to make his inevitable asswhipping that much sweeter. Cell was pompous but he was a menacing motherfucker and that's why he was able to stick around for so long without getting boring. It never got to the point during his saga where you felt like the writers were just keeping him around to fill up airtime (this shit happened all the time in the second season of Gantz), and that's precisely because of his constant transformations. It felt like you were fighting a different enemy each time. Buu is sort of the same way although he wasn't really menacing, he was just creepy. Raditz was just a snaky, slimy motherfucker, and I mean, that doesn't really make him a good character but it makes him a good villain, which is what counts. Good guy-wise, you have Goku who is just, your typical Greek hero. Not only is he the toughest man on Earth, but he's an uncorruptable, pure, genuinely good person who FIGHTS FOR JUSTICE and HATES EVIL. A little boring but it comes with the territory. Then you have Vegeta who is just, the fucking baddest dude ever even though he constantly gets his ass handed to him by everyone. The fact that he turns into a family man by the end of the show but still has the same bombastic attitude, with the same bombastic rivalry with KAKAROT just makes him that much better. By far DBZ's best character. Piccolo is ice-cold and takes absolutely no shit from any man, but he's also a good and righteous person at heart. Gohan is a little whiny, but he develops from this little kid into a full fledged, asskicking machine, and he's only a half saiyan at that. Same goes for Trunks, and being related to Vegeta only makes him that much better. Krillin is somehow a monk and a player at the same time which makes him awesome as fuck. Master Roshi loves porn and just generally does not give a fuck. He is what every man should strive to be in his old age. Hercule is a side-side character but he still deserves special mention for being the most hilarious Ron Jeremy look-a-like ever, and for being the PROUDEST and TOUGHEST fighter Earth has ever seen. Personally, I think he deserves his own series. It would be the most manly shounen anime ever made. Anyway, I think you get the point I'm trying to make by now. DBZ's characters are one of a kind and you'd probably be hard pressed to find one that isn't at least redeemable in some way or another. Sometimes they can be a little inconsistently written (Trunks conquers the shit out of Frieza in like 3 minutes, despite the fact that it took Goku AN ENTIRE SAGA to beat him. What the hell is that about?), but for the most part, this is the reason you will continue to come back to this story.\
Still, I can't, in all good conscience, give DBZ a 10. As much as I would like to, a 10 implies that the show in question is practically flawless. Cowboy Bebop deserves a 10. FLCL deserves a 10. Bokurano, Baccano!, NGE, and Outlaw Star all deserve 10s. Big O deserves a 10 but I gave it a 9 for ripping off Flash Gordon in the OP (other than that it's excellent). These are all pinnacles of anime achievement, and each one of them is in some way or another the best at what they try to do. DBZ certainly has elements that deserve 10s. In fact, in retrospect, an 8 is probably too low. Still, I can't ignore some of the gaping flaws this show has, and combine that with an astoundingly bad soundtrack that literally makes my ears cry, and you start losing points pretty fast. This is not to say I don't recommend DBZ. In fact, it's just the opposite. If you don't watch DBZ you might as well just stay in bed all day and start buying products from infomercials because you're already robbing yourself of a beautiful experience---a journey that every man should embark on at least once in his life. However, if you're coming into this show with unrealistic expectations you are going to be disappointed and will probably end up right back here, writing a hate review about how \"the story is cliche\" and \"the fight scenes drag on\" instead of enjoying it for what it is, like you should.\
Overall? Watch it if you're one of the 3 people on Earth that haven't already. Otherwise, watch it again for that glorious nostalgia.\

    If anyone knows of Shounen anime Then there is No doubt \
anyone would of course heard of Dragon ball Z which I'm obviously sure \
most people who are reading this review have and are not hopefully sleeping under a rock. \
Its One of the earliest shounen animes along side others. The show itself has probably had\
one of the Biggest impact of a shounen anime I've seen in my lifetime growing up besides the likes of attack on titan, Fullmetal Alchemist and Death note and yet till this day\
it has many viewers still checking it out. some have finish seeing it, some re watch it, some\
          \
        if not Loads of people own it or they don't, but they sure as hell know about it already.\
This series has its fair share of flaws upon viewing but it also makes up for some of these many moments in the series that are so awesome and unforgettable that in its own right has become an Iconic series in its story along with akira toriyama's art style alone in the world of anime which is why its easily one of my favorite animes and NO, I don't mean that in a Nostalgia kind of way,\
Here is my review..\
Story - 9\
In most Shounen animes the stories tend to have similar concepts of the whole Heroes (Underdogs) Overcomes the powerful Villain scenarios where seeing to do the impossible is  very typical of course, but that has always been the trait in many cases whether the protagonist of a show is surrounded by friends or enemies. \
DBZ is an Old anime that started off in this trend. It was also influence by a lot of movies, \
shounen animes such as saint seiya, other mythological stories and a blend of eastern and \
western cultural references from the past.\
The world of Dragon ball has a lot of these and so much more to its own universe \
even though a lot of its focus is on the fighting since it is a battle shounen anime. \
The story mainly centers around our main protagonist Goku and his son Gohan \
for some years after the previous series Dragon Ball. \
Goku for the remainder of the time has trained to become the strongest warrior he\
possibly can be, enough to defeat his enemies and of course to look out for his family however what is unknown to him at this point is his brother that is unknown to him Radditz an evil alien warrior who comes to earth seeking goku out which for the \
most part changes the many fate of the characters for the entire series to come. \
From the point Radditz meets Goku, He is told about his past and his heritage about being part of a powerful alien tribe known as the Saiyans or Saiya-jins If you prefer\
It includes the reason why he is here on earth especially from the original Dragon ball series where goku's own origin at the time was hardly known about and was almost a mystery until now. (pretty much the anime superman's origin story with some differences mainly with goku who actually was sent to destroy everyone on earth not to save it.)\
and long story short, \
Goku decides to put aside of what he is and from the rest of the series he, his son gohan, along with his friends and new allies in Piccolo, Vegeta, trunks and other characters continue on fighting against those that pose a threat to the earth along with the rest of other civilizations which becomes a Huge order with some ridiculously over the top relentless training that the characters have to take to ascend pass their limits in order to protect their loved ones and the  of course the universe.\
Basically Its quite a simple story yet some events can change drastically making it to be an overwhelming struggle at an alarming scale even with the exception of the dragonballs. \
The story itself is split into different arcs known as sagas each with a different story scenario and different antagonists who have their own agendas. \
The villains play a big key role in the development of certain main characters \
as well as the story and fights.\
Within the setting of this series there are features similar to the original series for starters the fighters can create Chi / Ki to gain incredible surge of immense power and abilities. \
Also from a world setting stand point you have Prehistoric Giant creatures, Futuristic technology, the afterlife, Supernatural elements, Different animal species, wishing the dead back to the living, and of course many memorable moments that the characters do in the series that can range from simply epic, to funny, to sad, to stupid, to strange, to Downright bad ass or Just plain evil which can be seen in every arc.\
However there are of course minor issues that I do have about the story and that is mainly with the incredibly slow pacing and lack of progression with certain characters of the original series dragon ball.\
Not to mention missed opportunities for other story developments and a little inconsistency with the writing within the arcs sometimes where some might get quite slow and repetitive or might have fillers to drag on some episodes here and there, \
Frieza not being able to know what 5 minutes of time is also laughable in this case as well.\
The Ki powering up which will also leave viewers having to endure these pacing issues unless they have to skip some seconds or minutes ahead, \
But then again those were the 80s and 90s with certain animes. \
But that being said these are mainly the issues in my opinion that I feel take a long time for any specific build up with this series only because the anime at the time I know was trying to catch up with the manga from time to time when it was broadcasting on TV channels like toonami and other channels back then which is understandable since its also the case for other\
shounen animes of late as well.\
.\
I've also notice some people tend to think the titled dragon ball referring to obviously the 7 orange magical orbs to grant wishes, tend to hurt and devalue the series mainly because of the insignificance of death most of the time. (which there are)\
Now To simply address those who say Death always makes a convincing plot twist for a show to be good, I've notice viewers complaining that in ordered to feel something for characters they need to die in order to give yourself some sense of attachment of feelings towards that specific character or moments if you will? but I'm sorry, Is it just me or as a viewer does that seem kinda strange?? \
let me explain.\
If that is the case then most anime should have their main characters dying left and right to make the story better, to feel some sense of pity to the characters along their path in the story (WRONG.)\
The fact is, it doesn't prove anything what so ever yes it can be somewhat important and I can understand if its meant to give some shock value but honestly that sounds very cheap for character development and Plot progression if you ask me, Its already overused nowadays\
in a lot of animes without any significance of knowing and enjoying these characters for the most part and yes I haven't forgotten about that little popular quote itself stating \
(PEOPLE DIE WHEN THEY ARE KILLED) or even (YOLO) blah blah blah.\
But interestingly enough when you think about it the dragon balls  is what made that unique prospect within its own series stand out.\
Because It gives the characters that much more of an objective to strive in finding the dragon balls when events could go so horribly wrong which a lot of times is the premise and sometimes seems to be the case throughout the series, its also the same for some villains too like for example when vegeta and nappa arrived on earth vegeta told his saiyan compatriot nappa when you destroyed the city that can also ruin our chances of locating the dragon balls\
this is true in a sense if they become reckless in finding them.\
You see, That is what the original Dragon ball did within its own series,\
If all you cared about was seeing how characters die than there is no sense of this series to begin with here. It would only make the journey seem non-existent to a point since these sagas of the series is mainly about the journey and the battle shounen experience. \
So think to yourself, is death necessary in all things always? \
That is what makes DB/DBZ unique and different in a good way and If that is not your thing well than I'm sure there are plenty of other animes that take up a lot of serious death tolls for the most part and only guarantee you very little insight about the characters before they are pretty much one foot in the grave. \
With all that being said, the story is a mix of intense fights, light hearted comedy and\
serious moments too along with a sense of sci fi and supernatural elements to it.\
From each arc there are some of the most memorable arcs I've seen in shounen animes in general, they may not be as thought provoking as other shows I've seen but it still has these enjoyable merits that for a 1989 -1994 series, it can still hold its ground today in terms of that entertainment.\
Characters - 10\
Like I said about the main issue I had from before with its story was just the lack of some of the character progression from the original series dragon ball who are mainly on the sideline for the most part and ironically at the same time other characters are really amazingly well written including Vegeta, Gohan, krillin, Trunks, and Piccolo  not to mention goku and vegeta who have one of the best rivalries in the shounen genre. even some of the villains like Radditz, Cell, and Frieza etc are done amazingly well.\
Sure most of the characters are stereotypes here and there but they are of course shonen characters at the end of the day so what do you expect, it is a battle shounen is it not?\
The Characters are easily the main driving force of the show and can easily get the blood boiling and muscles pumped up when it goes to the extreme almost bringing out an inner fighter in you especially when watching it. The characters have some really good interactions with one another and can easily make you have a personal attachment to 1 of them in some way in terms of their personality.\
Art - 6\
Old series tend to have an outdated look for examples the original Dragon ball, Berserk, Evangelion, Sailor Moon, Saint Seiya, Shadow Skills, Fist of the north star, Yu Yu Hakusho, Slayers etc,\
DBZ is no different in that regard.\
Its funny because for its generation the art and animation style in its action was actually ahead of its time of the late 80s and are still till this day entertaining to watch since its a mixtures of very long and short fights and are sometimes done sometimes in an excessively dragged out fashion but with a very Fast pace rate where you see characters having hand to hand combats in this sky with a mixture of projectiles, powerful impacts and explosions along with gut wrenching body blows that always seem to intensify the more you watch.\
If I had to describe the action it would be like an over the top street fighter meets the Justice league with some supernatural elements here and there.\
And yes Of course, the animation is re-used often which is obviously noticeable and sometimes it can be lacking which is a real shame but thanks to Akira toriyama's art it actually has a great distinct look to it like for example some of the features in the environment would start to feel the intensity of the battles including where the locations are, especially details to the characters like the look of cell for example to me is one of the most unique looking design for a villain that I've seen in anime as he undergoes different transformations not to mention Super Saiyan transformations like Super Saiyan 3 Goku which looks freakin BadAss!! and that is saying a lot for the depiction of the other characters in Toriyama's art.\
No doubt the animation is the weakest aspect of the show which might turn of some people who are looking into animes with great animation But to be fair for others who are open minded this isn't that much of a big deal though I wouldn't mind for a newly updated animation for this series as much as anyone would for example like what other animes have started to do like Hellsing Ultimate, evangelion rebuilds and the new sailor moon crystal series reboot etc,\
If DBZ had new animation such as that chances are this section could easily be a 10! \
but for now its only just passable, animation wise speaking it doesn't quite\
contend too well with others from other battle shounen series unfortunately but its art is\
still pretty decent enough regardless.\
Sound - 8\
Now Sorry if I'm going on a little rant here, but by chance Have you ever heard anyone debating over what sounds better in the series? \
Funimation?, Ocean?, Dub Vs Sub Vs DBZ Kai vs Bruce Faulconer vs other dubs, This that yady Yadda, But For me I'm in the group of I've seen them all and don't really care mainly because\
at the end of the day its THE SAME FREAKIN SERIES!!!!!\
And possibly most, if not, a Hell of a lot of people know the popular story now \
OVER 9000 Times Already!!!!!!!!!\
Back on topic, seriously besides that for the record both dub or sub were kinda rough around the edges, its obvious that it could clearly be better however a lot people still like to debate over this which i can understand but I don't see the point as I don't have anything against any voice actors or Voice actresses after all Nobody is perfect and I have already stated that this is an old school anime not to mention at the end of the day It is a matter of preference. \
Ether way, if you do watch this anime and you want a more clearer translation i would also recommend watching DBZ Kai for its Translation its not perfect by any means but its a lot more accurate to the manga still. \
So the dubs and subs in some areas can be quite debatable I hear, but i feel both do suit \
a lot more in a different kind of way, and for the music the openings and closings is ok, a little cheezy at times and can sometimes leave much to be desired. The music for the dub and sub seems to fit well for some of the overall tone of the series as the music blends in well with the action, supernatural themes, sci-fi themes and comedic themes unfolding in this show, at times again it can sound a little repetitive after a while for a series that is 291 episodes long and so i feel the music is fair no matter which version of the show your watching So to me for this category of sound I'd say its pretty decent still, but it could be lot more better.\
Enjoyment - 10\
I have re watched this anime series more times than any other anime in general and for a series that finished Decades ago and I'm still in my early 20s I still enjoy the build up with its characters, interactions,  morals and a Crazy fun story that is very inspirational like its predecessor dragon ball.\
It simply feels like family to me and that is more than enough of an enjoyable series with some of the most iconic and memorable moments and fights that I have grown to love about anime in general to date, simple as that. \
If you really need to see an old epic action shounen fighting show its definitely worth giving this a shot.\
Overall - 8.5\
Now I've already stated the positives and negatives towards this without blinding my inner \
fan boy to this particular anime. While People might say its overrated like other animes they honestly would have a point, But to others This anime became a gateway to anime in general for a lot of people out there as well as myself back then. Its also a significant template used in other shows to build off on and I couldn't be any more thankful for this as this is one of my personal favorite animes of all time that pave the way for shounen animes and a lot of others in general to take notes and to get out there in the big pond themselves and do justice like many others. I'm not saying Dbz is the best but it has succeeded globally for what its done and its that simple.\
Dragon ball / Dragon ball Z has had its influence for so long now and yet still \
continues to pass it down for the next generation. \
Without a doubt its just like that saiyan goes\
 ''Legends never die''\
It is what it is and for the most part if you're still skeptical about this anime do not worry because i know its not meant for everyone. But there is a little something for everyone\
as it has different forms of entertainment making it a revolutionary Shounen anime \
in its own right.  \
Other shounen anime Reccomendations - \
I'll point you to Yu Yu Hakusho, Rurouni Kenshin, Death note, Fullmetal Alchemist (old and new), Fist of the north star, Saint Seiya, Hajime no Ippo and the Hunter x Hunter series\

    I started watching Dragonball Z at a very young age and even when I was young I loved it although I didn't know what was going on. I grew up watching the English dub on Cartoon Network and Fell in Love with the Show. Dragonball Z is an Epic Anime with Brilliant Fight scene's and Great Characters.\
If you are Looking for a Great Fighting Anime look no further. \
I can safely say that Dragonball Z is the King of Fighting Anime.\
Dragonball Z is a Fun Anime and also my Favorite!\
Story\
Dragonball Z is a story about a naive man named Goku trying to be come stronger\
          \
but Powerful villains  stand in his way and try to take over the world kill him blah blah blah. That is the story in its simplest form.\
Now I will review the story. Dragonball Z has Emotional moments, Funny moments,\
Really cool fights, Romance and the occasional plot twist.\
Dragonball Z story is very enjoyable and will leave you hanging on the edge of your seat or cursing at your TV. The show has allot of Fights and they are Amazing it is what every one wants to see super powerful beings Kicking the Crap into each other.Dragonball Z has quite a bit of Humor as well example: Krillin (not being able to get Girls or getting his but Kicked all the Time) Goku (Food Humor and idiocy)\
Vegeta (Goku getting on His nerves).\
Although it is My Favorite Anime I will say it does have fillers.\
I can safely say not as much as Naruto.\
What I liked about the story is the Brilliant fights and it is full of fun Characters.\
Art\
Dragonball Z art is Good but dated.\
I you are planning are planning to watch the series if you are looking for quality I recommend FUNimations new Remastered Box sets. (if you don't mind wide screen).\
\
sound\
I will review the sound in two sections Japanese Dub\
on the Background Music and the Voice Actors\
and then the English Dub.\
Japanese Dub\
First I will start with the Background Music.\
The Japanese Background music Can fit the scenes very well but it sounds very old like a seventy's cheesy Horror movie. What I like about the Japanese Background music is in some scenes the don't and any background Music whilst FUNimation's sound track have music in Every scene.\
What I don't Like about the Japanese music is that it can get very annoying.\
English Dub   \
I am reviewing FUNimation's Dub and not ocean Dub or any other Dub so this is purely based on Funi's dub.  \
Funimation's music fits in really well with the Fight scenes and that is what I like about it, because it makes the fights more dramatic and cooler but when there is no fighting I Hate FUNimation's Music Purely because it doesn't fit the scene's well.\
FUNimation Has Done  a Brilliant Job when choosing their voice actors. Each Character voice suits them really well.\
Character\
The Characters in Dragonball Z a truly Unique.\
You Have Goku The Naive Hero of the Story \
Vegeta The short Tempered Bad Ass\
Gohan The son of Goku.\
The Characters all fall into Place although there are some useless one's and it would not matter if they are there or not. Goku Learns of Vegeta And Vegeta learns of Goku.\
They have such Good Characters and they are not your average heroes .\
Enjoyment\
Dragonball Z is a Very Fun series very easy to get into.\
Overall\
Overall I would have to give it a 9/10\
Happy Watching\

    Dragonball Z, many, like me, grew up watching this dubbed on TV. At the time I though it was the coolest thing to ever grace the television and never missed an episode. I've probably seen most every episode 2-3 times. The story is all about how Goku and friends grow from relative weaklings to the most powerful beings in the Universe. As each new enemy is defeated, another appears, training ensues, baddie defeated. The story isn't that deep, it is your typical good vs evil battle with the whole universe at stake. Much of the plot is focused on friendship and overcoming impossible odds to\
          \
        defeat the enemy that is currently threatening your life. Although the story is generally repeated, you can't help but get into it each arc.\
The artistic talent and quality of production definitely increases over the course of the show; however that is to be expected with a show nearly 300 episodes in length. The backdrops are usually pretty plain with the same hills or trees cropping up all over the place. The cities are often the same with no way of telling one from the other. The work on the characters themselves though is very well done and although a lot of frames are often repeated the fights are usually well done, for the time anyway. Let's not forget that this series started airing in Japan in 1989. It was extremely good for its time and something very unique.\
The opening track for the US adaptation of Dragonball Z will likely forever be etched in my mind. Probably the worst opening I have ever seen. Opening aside, the music for the show is reasonably well done and although it is often repeated it isn't to the point of annoying and is alway used to help accent the mood of the current scene. The main reason for giving the Sound a score of 8 is the voice acting. The voice acting for the English dub of Dragonball Z is the best I have ever seen and will likely ever see. I tried re-watching it with a sub but couldn't get past the first episode as soon as I heard the voice used for Goku. This is one of the few shows I will ever say has a better English voice cast than the Japanese. Goku is truly bad...\
Most anyone who has ever seen an episode of anything anime related knows of and has seen Dragonball Z. I won't go in depth on each characters, but they are all unique in their own way and usually have a funny side as well as a serious side. This is a side of the show you often don't hear about: the comedy. Although it isn't always prelevent, the comedy is always there to break up a situation. The inclusion of Mr Satan later is an effort to make the show more comedy oriented, but it will always be first and foremost an action adventure show.\
I, as a child, spent many hours watching this show and loved it with all my heart. Looking back, after watching many better anime, I can see the many faults of the show, but that won't make it any less memorable. Most definitely not up to the same standards of shows today, but  Dragonball Z is a part of my childhood and I will always have fond memories of it.\

    Ah yes, Dragon Ball Z, this really takes me back. This series used to be everywhere, there were DBZ lunchboxes, DBZ toys, DBZ VHS sets,& DBZ video games. Well nowadays, it feeds off mostly on video games now, some good(like the Budokai and Tenkaichi series, Burst Limit,& dbz legends), many bad(like Final Bout, Sagas,& Raging Blast). It is widely considered a milestone in anime fandom as it is one of the backthroughs in spreading the art form, along with Pokemon, Akira,& Sailor Moon. It is also(along with the original) inspired many to become artists(including me).\
I'll try my best to make this review seem as unbiased\
          \
        as possible.\
Story- It's not the deepest or well-developed plot in the world, but it does have a plot let I mind you, although looking back it does have it's flaws. The story does move pretty slow but not as exaggarately slow as many make it out to be, the filler isn't completely pointless as it does give us more insight to the plot in some places than the manga though it created several errors like Vegeta's knowledge of Planet Vegeta's demise. Anyways DBZ's storytelling isn't like most anime out there(although it does gets repetitive at times), as it enthesis on action like no other,& the show follows a unqiuely-told yet easy to follow good vs. evil plotline, we see how the Z-warriors rise and fall as heroes, we feel for how they struggles to keep to protect the ones they love from evil,& with enough training and teamwork(moreso the earlier sagas), there no limits to what they achive, so the story is character-driven, but despite all that, I felt some things could have been changed, the Buu Saga is pretty much the only saga that we could have leaved without, & it could have atleast have Gohan being the hero in that saga. The series should have ended at the Frieza or Cell saga as they had great endings as oppossed to the Buu Saga(as much as I enjoyed it) which had a horrible ending. \
Art and Animation- DBZ overall looks very good for it's age, the art style and animation is vibrant and colorful, & the characters have the unqiue and well-detailed designs that we were familiar with from the original Dragon Ball(although the style changes through the series and characters become leaner and more muscular). It may recylcle animation frames a lot and sometimes it appears cheap. Overwise, good job, here.\
Sound- If you've only seen the dub, you'll be surpised for how they handled the series here, Goku and all the male members of his family are voiced by one person,& it's a female(Masako Nozawa). Most U.S. DBZ fans don't seem to like this version because they feel the voices \"don't fit well\" , but it takes time to get used to and once you have, you'll realize the voices do fit the characters well, for example, Ryō Horikawa's voice really brings out Vegeta's arrogant and royal personality. The soundtrack also gets my praise because it is composed by a live orchestra and the majority of the vocal music is performed by Hironobu Kageyama . It gets a 9 instead of a 10 because the music is more fitting for the original Dragon Ball and some of the dialogue is unnecessery.\
Characters- DBZ has one of the most likable cast in anime history, they may not be as complex as characters from Evangelion and such, but the series is filled with so many memorable characters like Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Goten, Piccolo, Tien, the list goes on. The characters are also really nicely-developed, over the course of the years, the character go throw very subtle changes, they grow up without us noticing it, like how Vegeta's transition from evil to good,& Gohan's from being a wimply little nerd to a seasoned fighter much like his father, the filler also helps to develope the characters. As for the villains, while Vegeta was great as a villain, Frieza was the best since he was very complex,& Impefect Cell is also up there because I liked his sneaky and satistic demeanor. \
Enjoyment- Yes I know it isn't the best but it's still one of my favorites, I enjoyed the accompany of a new villain each saga, with some of the best fight scenes in anime history such as Goku vs. Vegeta, Goku and Piccolo vs. Raditz, Goku vs. Ginyu, Goku vs. Android 19, Goku vs. Cell, Gohan vs. Cell, Goku vs. Vegeta(the rematch), Majin Buu vs. Evil Buu,& Vegito vs. Super Buu(Gohan Absorbed), although I'd admit I felt some annoyance to the fight scenes that lasted too long(I.E. Goku vs. Frieza). One thing I like about is that it doesn't take itself to seriously, DBZ also offers handfull of entertaining non-action episodes that also help in keeping the story from getting boring, like the driver test episode, which is the arguably the most memoriable piece of filler in the entire series. DBZ may not have as much humor as the original Dragon Ball, but it still was a lot of humor.\
Positives:\
+ Unique good vs. evil plotline\
+ Good Art and Animation for the time\
+ Good voice-acting\
+ Excellent fight scenes\
+ Great music\
+ Likable and well-defined characters \
+ Good humor\
Negatives:\
- Horrible ending to the series\
- Pace can be taxing\
\
Final Verdict:\
\
It may not be the best of the best, I don't feel it should even be a candidate. Despite all the glaring flaws stated, I highly recommend it. \

    Oh boy, I'm digging my own grave again...\
We have all heard of Dragonball (of Z I mean, noone watched the original), it was a huge name in the 90s, that introduced anime to the rest of the world through the only good dub I've seen today and is responsible for inspiring hundreds of other anime and mangas. So why would anyone hate it?\
Well, as was mentioned, Dragonball WAS responsible for many of today's mangas, creating (or at least making famous) various stereotypes that lasted though decades. Some examples of the wonderful stereotypes that Dragonball made norm include: 1)Stupid protagonist in shounen. 2)Evil is stupid. 3)Death\
          \
        has no meaning. 4)Females are all annoying tsunderes. 5)Overly annoying episode-long training sessions. 6)Abilities explained mid-fight to the opponent (...)7)Transformations (ok that can be done right, but the way dragonball did it, definitely wasn't, with the exception of Buu).7)Overly-Recycled animations.8)Overly predictable plots with the villains smiling evilly and laughing maniacally even when in disguise, reinforcing point 2, but also for some reason actually fooling the \"heroes\".9)Complete and absolute lack of character development.\
I could go on.\
As you see, what I truly dislike about Dragonball is the legacy it left behind. Dragonball was an example to be followed by everyone else to be sure, a very, very bad example. Lazy writing, a despicable presentation of females (that finally started to change in shounens thanks to Fairy Tail), brain-dead characters, half-assed animation (I'm looking at you One Piece). Dragonball was in all aspects, definitely something intended for children. \"But Dragonball has so much violence!\" You don't say. But guess what, freaking Tom and Jerry also has a lot of violence (and with about the same amount of actual deaths as well), yet noone questions Tom and Jerry being a kid's show just because it has violence in it. Violence doesn't make things mature when it has no consequence people. Violence has meaning when it can create PERMANENT damage, physical or emotional. An anime where 2 people make punchbags of each other and 5 minutes later walk it off isn't an anime that should be proud of its violence. If anything it's insulting it.\
The funny thing is, now that Dragonball Super is being released, everyone is whining about how bad it is. What really gets me going, is how DB fans complain that it's totally different from what they grew up with. Really? Is that how you feel about it? Because personally, all I see is EXACTLY the same product you grew up with. Now however, you have been exposed to actual \"quality\", even by accident, and can see DB for what it truly is: Trash. \
Dragonball's glory is long gone. With the internet connecting our stupid brains together and forcing us to hear the opinions of others as well, a piece of crap like Dragonball will never reach fame again. Almost all of its descendants have long since surpassed it, learning from the mistakes of their father and not repeating them. Those include Fairy Tail, Bleach and (it saddens me to say it), even Naruto. Today's writers will struggle to produce intelligent plots, intriguing enemies with personalities that go way beyond \"bad for the yolo\", and actual relationships between the characters, making them sympathetic and memorable. In other words they will do all the things that Dragonball never did, and never will do.\
\"But then why do I have such fond memories of the original?\" For the same reason you have fond memories of Pokemon, Sailor Moon and even Ice T. Because of nostalgia. The number 1 enemy of intelligence and objectivity. Through the spectrum of nostalgia everything seems nice and ideal, since it was a simpler time back then. That's a lie of course. The 90s were just as complex as the 21st century and probably a bit dirtier. YOU however, were younger back then, and as a result STUPIDER, which made you unable to perceive the world correctly. And of course with the years passing and all the bad memories fading away into oblivion, Dragonball, in all its majestic CRAP, becomes in your brain a wonderful sweet memory. \

    Before you start reading, please keep in mind that I am a huge Dragon Ball Z fan.  So that may influence my opinion a bit. \
Dragon Ball Z marked quite a few firsts in its genre.  One could almost argue that if it wasn't Dragon Ball Z, anime may not have become what it is today.  It started in the 1980's in Japan, but did not reach American TV until the 90's.  I remember coming home from school every day as a kid and turning my TV on to Cartoon Network to watch this show.  Fast forward ten years later\
          \
        and I still find a lot of enjoyment in the series, even after watching each episode numerous times.  \
The story is pretty basic when compared to most mainstream anime these days, but it works so well for this particular show.  I guess you could almost compare the main character, Son Goku, to Superman.  There seems to be a constant theme of forgiveness and redemption through the show as well, as the viewer as well as the main characters always try to see the good in others rather then the evil.  With that said, one could really learn a lot from a show like Dragon Ball Z.  In a way, as a kid, it taught me a lot of important morals and values.  A lot of the enjoyment value also came from the story.  It was so well written and done for an action cartoon that I honestly do have a hard time finding a complaint.  I guess if I did have one it would be that torwards the end things start to get a little same-y, but other then that it worked perfect.\
The art of the show was also fairly good, but it could have been better.  It always seemed like the environments used in many of the battles were re-used.  Characters often would fight in the same desert based scenario or the same wilderness one.  While detail was added to the art as time went on, it always seemed lacking to me.  Even the recent Dragon Ball Z special that came out seemed like the art was a step or two behind its time.  \
The music and sound really did shine out in DBZ and made up for a few of the downsides in the art department.  There were some pretty epic soundtracks that came with this anime and each one really fit the battle taking place.  I really liked some of the themes that were associated with the main characters, as it really set the mood for the character's personality.  \
The characters were very well written, each having his or her own good and bad sides.  What was interesting is the way the viewer could see the change in personality in some characters, who would start off evil but later become good.  Again, the theme of forgiveness could be seen here and was backed up in one or two main characters.  Viewers and fans would also get really attached to some characters, more so then in other animes I know.  \
To wrap this up, Dragon Ball Z is a great anime and could provide a lot more entertainment then a lot of mainstream action cartoons today.  To be honest, I still find DBZ to be a better show then Naruto.  Again, the fact I am a huge fan may interfere with that, but when I look it at it from a normal viewers point of view, I still see the same thing.  Naruto lost its charm after the first 120 episodes or so and Dragon Ball Z maintained it all the way to the end.  If you haven't seen this legendary anime yet, I recommend checking it out.  It gets a 9/10 overall.  \

    Like many anime fans that started young and grew up watching anime DBZ was always a favorite of mine. Had this review been written when I was 13 I probably would have given it 10s across the board. However I am not 13 anymore and my tastes in anime have matured over the years. Thus this review is written in the context of a 21 year old near college graduate and one that has a vastly larger collection than my formative years.\
Story - 7\
Dragon Ball Z follows off years after the end of the Dragon Ball series. As the characters have aged so have their\
          \
        battles. The scale of the battles have moved on from world threatening disaster to universal destruction. Unfortunately while the story starts strong in the Saiyan Saga the following Sagas continually get more and more drawn out. Like a developing method favoring commercial time than development as popularity of the series increased, each episode tells less and less story and become more and more fillers. Characters powering up turns from a 30 second awe inspiring moment to a 20 minute 'ok-get-over-yourself' scene. And it only gets worse throughout the series. Repetitious plot turns also take a couple points off of this score. How many times does it take for a villian to die in DBZ? Essentially no less than 10 times and a good 20-30 episodes.  None-the-less the story is indeed epic and is definitely addictive for a good crowd.\
Art - 8\
In the context of the time that DBZ was drawn the art was very good. Akira has a very distinct style that is easily recognizable and is exceptional. The only thing that brings down this score is repetitious use of particular cells and awkward proportions on the characters during particular scenes.\
Sounds - 6\
The voice talent for both languages is rough, but not horrible. Nothing about the voices or music will turn you away from the series but nothing will attract you to them.\
Character - 8\
This score seems to vary greatly on the particular character you are referring to. For example I believe that Goku's growth as a character fits well with the story. Gohan also develops especially well as he learns to cope with his own powers and responsibility to protect his family, friends, and the universe at large. Piccolo's fatherly affections for Gohan reveals the light inside and otherwise corrupted soul. Then there are weak characters, chiefly in Vegeta. Vegeta's character in my opinion does not grow or develop at all. He's a prick from the time he unnecessarily kills one of three of the last Saiyans in existence and he's a prick when he lets every bad guy escape so that they can come back and kick the crap out of him. He gets beaten so badly so often because of his own actions that I would have expected his character to give up fighting forever somewhere mid series. Most supporting characters don't grow at all from the previous episode they are seen in despite sometimes years passing.\
Enjoyment - 9\
DBZ is a guilty pleasure. Despite the many flaws in the series there is no doubting the enjoyment of the series. I was down right obsessed for a good 2 years of my life and I don't regret. Sometimes I still go back to watch my favorite episodes with a cold beer. You will fall in love with at least one character for whatever reason. Krillin was my hero.\
Overall - 7\
No doubt about the influence that DBZ has had on the industry. I doubt that series such as Naruto or Bleach would have had a shot without the success of the Dragon Ball series to finance their endless productions. \

    Well, if you've never seen this show, you must have been living under a rock, or a giant turtle, or something. Or maybe you've been living in some kind of strange alternate dimension...\
Yeah, it's Dragonball Z. Some crazy anime show. It's been extremely popular in the past. It still has a big following, somewhere, I think. It's spawned like 30 video games. 'But is it any good?' you ask. Well I've come here to tell you.\
The show spans for almost 300 episodes, and is ultimately drawn out so long that it feels boring and pointless at times. Oftentimes nothing happens in an episode, except for\
          \
        a bit of powering up, some monologue-ing , and maybe an 'exciting' revelation that gives just enough incentive to watch the next episode. (Will Goku survive? Will Piccolo die? Will Krillin stop sucking? Find out next time!) Yeah. However, I do like some of the visual storytelling that goes on when there's no dialog. Reminds me of old spaghetti westerns like The Good, Bad and the Ugly.\
There's just enough story to propel the main focus of the anime, which is the fighting. The fighting is where the enjoyment of the show comes in. Who doesn't like to see a couple of over-powered super-beings beating the crap out of each other, and subsequently destroying the surrounding environment? Truly, the fights become epic and extravagant, and are decently entertaining when they build up to one. This is where the 7 enjoyment rating comes from.\
The characters are well-designed and are decently well developed. They are generally easy to remember, especially Piccolo. (Yeah, he's green, gruff, and has a soft spot. Now you know everything about him) The world's pretty interesting. It's some kind of future world that is also inhabited by dinosaurs and strange animal-people.\
The music is orchestrated, and sounds a bit dated, but fits the scenes and the epic scope of the show. However, there are some awful disco Superfriends style songs that are a bit cringe worthy at times, but overall, it's decent, and more original than most animes. \
Overall I give this show a 6 out of 10. It's really nothing profound or meaningful. Purely for entertainment value, I give the show a 8 because of the awesome fight scenes and the memorable characters. Unfortunately, DBZ is in need of some serious editing. It's overlong and lacks satisfying closure. (avoid the terrible spawn, Dragonball GT. It will ruin all love you may gain for Dragonball and Dragonball Z) Watch it if you are a fan of action, martial arts, and shonen melodrama.\

    Most of my friends who like this anime watched it when it was on the air and we were children, but at the time I only had basic cable. I tried to pick it up a decade later, but I really can't say I'm sorry I missed out on this. It was going fine at first, but at one point I came to realize this: that if I were to go outside, plant two scarecrows in the brush facing one another, put blonde wigs on them, and listen to a tape of people screaming on a loop, and spend 100 hours staring at them, I\

Why?: Some lack motives, and what ones have motives are antagonists with admittedly cliche, lame, boring or ridiculous motives. I prefer antagonists you can empathize with, but honestly the only character who had a decent motive, predictable and overused as it may be, was Baby in GT. I can empathize with his motive at the least, because Saiyans took over his creator's (Tuffles) planet, Planet Plant.\
Characters also don't do much planning before hand about what they're gonna do, and don't have a lot of plot or thoughts outside of: \"Fight my enemy\
          \
        or have others fight them first and then fight them myself in fits of rage.\"\
I prefer it when antagonists have a good plan behind their fighting. What are you planning? What are you stalling for? What intelligent plot do you have behind your actions that we can't possibly understand? But honestly, its predictable, as DBZ's come down to a science (will discuss in my next point). \
Similarly, Dragon Ball Z's characters are far too predictable. Goku's evil brother shows up, punches him, tells him he's his evil brother and Goku had a mission to do. Then he kidnaps his son and will hold him in ransom unless Goku destroys Earth.\
2.) Repetitive plot is repetitive is repetitive is repetitive is repetitive but not relevant.\
Why?: Honestly, I have found maybe 3 variations of the same plot device used throughout the series, the only ones that were relatively interesting in the slightest being Cell Saga and maybe Baby.\
However, each one is so similar to the other, it's gotten unbearably predictable.\
Not only that, but Dragon Ball has no overarching plot whose conclusion its all leading up to. Dragon Ball is a.... Sub-Plot starts, sub-plot ends with minimal connections to that one in the next sub-plot anime.\
Additionally, the ONLY suspense I found throughout the entire series was when Goku was going to be LATE for a fight, because Goku was a character with strength that is glaringly superior to other characters, it came down to him and Vegeta (perhaps Gohan) being the only ones who can actually fight the enemy. And honestly, since DBZ holds true to its formulated, admittedly repetitive plot, I knew that Goku would show up and kill the antagonist.\
3.) Versatility in powers? What's that?\
This is staying short and sweet. With just a low amount of exceptions, Dragon Ball powers are incredibly repetitive. Characters with some imitation of a martial art, ungodly strength and speed, and some form of energy blasts, be it through technology(Androids) or life force (all other beings Ki). And when they need an enemy to be much stronger, what do they do? Slap the same gimmick onto antagonists two sagas one after another.\
Kinda lame, if you ask me... With no real versatility (variation) in powers, save a small amount of exceptions, it gets kinda lame. Instead of seeing how the protagonist uses their own exclusive powers to counter some stronger/more useful power in combat, it comes down to \"Who moves faster, punches harder and blasts more powerfully\" with minimal need for tactics. This is ESPECIALLY the case when fighting enemies like Buu and Cell who've got one thing going for them in particular: Dat regeneration tho. \
And the source of regeneration is interesting, right? Like, using a clever combination of lesser powers to give themselves something akin to regeneration? Some array and line up of some sort of items?\
And how is the regeneration solved? Clever use of items or powers to somehow stop the regeneration? Plans to somehow use their powers cleverly to get rid of the items or make the regeneration meaningless?\
Nah. BLAST STRONGER with a new technique, which is almost always hardly any different from his other techniques, but larger, stronger and takes longer to prepare.\
In all honestly, the ONLY enjoyments in the anime's series I ever got from watching it is the barely entertaining fight scenes and the decent music tracks. This anime is not worth your time and please do not waste it watching this anime. There are plenty of other, definitely superior anime of similar genres. I recommend you go watch them instead of this.\

    Ok, so I already did a DBGT review and I had strong opinions on why it isn't as bad as everyone says. Now it's time for my DBZ review and warning to all DBZ lovers I am going to trash on it... Just kidding, isn't that impossible?? DBZ has been known as the greatest anime and although I find that inaccurate it is definitively in the top five and the most influential anime of all time. \
Story- I really wanted to give it a 10 across the board, but I just couldn't. Most of you who are reading this have probably seen DBZ or know\
          \
        what happens in it. If you haven't seen it yet... let me tell you... the story is near close to perfect. To me everything is paced very well except for two arcs. The Ginyu force arc dragged on for way too long and it was getting extremely difficult for me to watch the whole arc the first time I saw the series. Also, the Buu arc. I love the last season, it's my favorite. But holy damn there is only so much I can take of the same guy regenerating constantly. I do not know why it dragged like that but in the end it doesn't kill the story. Also as a warning to anyone that hasn't seen it, there is filler in the show, but it aint like Naruto filler that lasts for 15000 episodes (obvious exaggeration) it's short and quick and actually entertaining. The story of an underdog never gets old nor does the fight for peace. It's truly a great story with very little problems.\
Art- I have no problem with the art. It suits the whole show. And the way the attacks are and the fight scenes and energy attacks you can tell that the staff put hard time into making a masterpiece.\
Sound- The tracks are so amazing in this show. You could easily buy a OST and listen to it in your house or in car and hum along to perfectly written pieces of music. The openings are really good and catchy. The second ending \"Angel\" is one of the best ending songs I have ever heard from an anime ever! And the Dubbing of DBZ is one of the best dubbing I have ever heard. There are only three anime where I can say that the Dub is better than the Sub. \
Character- Even if you haven't seen the show, everyone knows the story of Goku and his friends. The cast of characters work so well with each other there is so much character development and personal attachments that a viewer can have with these characters making it a masterpiece. The villains make the experience even better. The villains are so powerful and have the most evil of natures compared to most anime that you love to hate them. I always said, the true way to make a story work is to not have the best good guy but the best villain. I'm sure that I am not alone on that saying.\
So... DBZ. A lot of characters to love, plenty of villains to hate; a pretty decent pacing with the story, amazing fights and awesome sound and art. It's hard to argue with all the DBZ lovers because the show is that damn good. Personally, it is my 3rd favorite anime. The only two that are better IMO are FMA: Brotherhood and Yu Yu Hakusho. If you haven't seen DBZ and are reading this review, trust me and the general population, WATCH IT! If you have already seen it and are reading this review... WATCH IT AGAIN!! Now excuse me while I go Super Saiyan.  \

\"It's like watching two kids playing with their favourite action figurines, yelling at each other why one is so much better than the other, while someone presses every other minute the on/off-button, and holds them still for about five to ten minutes - this goes on and on for fifty hours or so, straight!\"\
- Pahatar, after 50 episodes of DBZ\
First of all, let me tell you a little story, about how I ended up losing 100 hours of my life, into this... anime. First of all, I didn't see this, when I was a kid,\
          \
         so... no nostalgia for me. All the same, my interest towards this... anime, awakened only about a year ago, when I stumbled upon some extremely funny videos, from TFS, which I wound out to be the funniest thing in my life! I got all the jokes - ironically! - loved all the characters, and their witty personalities, and I was always wanting more - that can't be a bad sign from an anime/parody, right? So I took it upon to myself to find out, wheter or not the original would be any better, than it's respectful parody was, and... well, this is where things get bad... really bad! And I mean... painful!\
Notice, I've already seen my fair share of anime, so after reading about 100 positive reviews of this one - seriously, I'm not kiddind! - I was promised time and time again, that \"DBZ is the best of the best, what anime as a media has to offer, with best action, deepest plots, stories, and the most complex and multi-dimensional characters, that I have ever seen in any other anime ever!\", which, to be fair, sounded like a huge overstatment, on so many levels! Obviously, I was a bit sceptic, but after literally tossing a coin about 500 times, I finaly started watching it... and ultimately, hated my decision, with a burning and painful passion! \
Given how many episodes this anime had per saga alone, I took some liberties from my 'anime-watching rules', and gave this anime about 15 episodes to win me over. I bearly got through 10 episodes, when I already wanted to stop... so I did. It took me actually full 8 months to see this turd through to the very end, and I hate myself forever and ever, for ever submitting myself to this... this!\
But lets not be all so brutally honest now! I mean, yeah... I think DBZ is great... if you're a little boy, lacking any sence or taste or brainmatter, and seen less than ten other animes, that is!\
\
Story (1) \
The story - if I can even call it that - is in it's most bare-boned, minimalistic way very, very basic, and therefore perfectly suitable for kids, or those who hate well-writen/complex and/or multileveled stories in general, and can easily enjoy their bones, without the meat. No fat, no salt... just bones. No content - just some flashy lights, and loud sounds.\
You've all heard the same summary of the plot before! It's about fighting. Very, very little of actual story... but much fighting. Or training. Or people dying. Or heroes watching other people dying/training/fighting. Heroes wait for the bad guy to show up - obviously, since the training/fighting/dying/resurrection- cycle is pretty much all these guys know what to do! - bad guy shows up, heroes train, then they fight, then they die, then they fight some more, then, a total ass-pull happens, the bad/good guy dies - or not, if the fans don't want him to! - and the circle repeats itself, like a inferno for a bad taste!\
Let me give you an example... It's not like any good fighting game, or hentai game actually needs a good story behind it, when the main audiense of these two genres just wants to see some violence and fucking, but still... I'd still be lying if I said that based on the thousand-or-more positive reviews, I wasn't expecting something more than this! Which I was! An awfully lot more! Maybe a little too much, now when I'm thinking about it...\
When it comes down to the bad writing, theres really no excuses here. Toriyama really can't write coherent, appealing, or even slightly interesting and meaningful stories, nor the characters, and those who can't, or refuse to see it, are already far too deep in their smudged up pool of nostalgia - no hope for a redemption for them. The so-called plot is only there, so that the story... I mean, the fights, can proceed accordingly, a one small, blurred sprint in every 3-5 episoded! \
Violence is the biggest selling point for DBZ, being its core and plot as a whole, but even that, it cannot do even mediocrely - best action in all of anime, yeah right, no! It doesn't evolve, or develope... it just keeps repeating itself over and over, using the same tricks, but only in a slightly bigger scale... in power, that is! (Drinking game! How many times you hear the word \"power\", in fifteen episodes! You'll be dead!) It's dull, it's repetive, and it doesn't even try to keep me interested enough, to try to keep my braincells intact! It just... insults me, and I hate, when the show, that I'm \"supposed\" to enjoy, insults me!\
Its not like simple stories are all automatically bad in my books - they just don't have to be lazy! And DBZ is lazy. It's lazy, because every action, threat or stake, that ever appears in the \"story\", is inconsequential at best, and nonsensical/boring, at worst, appealing only for the lowest common denominator, and no one else. And, the biggest sin, that allowed all of this inconsequential writing to ever take any place in the \"story\", were the Deus ex Machinas/asspulls, that plagued this whole show, evading any kind of actual drama, or consequenses! I mean... how much can I truly invest myself into a story, where the most pressive matters are, who's the strongest, and who fights who... or where death is just some meaningles inconvenience, since it can easily be reversed, and those who just decide to say dead, can pretty much just easily communicate with the living, and spend their days in this dream-like training/fighting- spa for alien males, for all eternity?! \
Death seems almost more appealing than being alive for these guys, so... why are they still alive?! Because Toriyama hates consequenses, and taking responsibilities as a writer - that's why! Thank goodness, that the Dragon can bring anybody back to live, without any real consequenses, or tolls to pay, because Lord knows, we don't need to deal with actual realistic drama or consequenses, or have any actual thought put into this piece of turd, now do we?! By the end of the Buu-saga, the 1/5 of the Earth's population would still be breathing, thanks to these incompetent retards! \
And that's just another big, huge gripe with me against this anime - no sense of justice! Any crime, you ever commit here, is easily forgiven, never mentioned ever again, and any punishment you may or may not receive, is pretty much just a slap on the wrist, and not always even that! Most of the \"heroes\" are former evil-duers and murderers, but they still get treated and glorified as if none of that ever happened, or it didn't really matter anyway - since when a genocide has ever been a crime forth of a legit punishment anyway?! This anime, was originally aimed for children, but... what the heck kinda moral is that for a any child?! Be a horrible monster, and later, be rewarded for that? What?!\
Still, the truly sad part to me is, that this would've been totally awesome series, if instead of intentionally being so \"serious\" and \"epic\" all the time, they could've done this to be some totally bat-shit crazy parody-like comedy... which I can only assume it was suppoused to be, considering how stupid the premise of this anime already was! If this was somewhere anywhere near being something like TFS or some another parody-like story, this could've been actually enjoyable to me, but no! It just had to be stupid, bland and boring instead! What a wasted, lazy potential this was... and I hate laziness!\
But, then again... maybe, I'm not even supposed to expect too much out of this! In the end... DBZ is just like those fighting/harem- games, where the story-mode is just something to skimp over, and get to the pounding! Obviously, the plot that keeps itself alive by the everlasting \"training to get stronger, villains get stronger, die/get stronger, some more training 'cause why not\"- plot-circle, it is evidently bound to be writen in a corner in multiple occasions, when braking the said circle becomes almost impossible. And once that said circle is soon being set in stone, it of course leaves behind all these aching questions, that I just never couldn't escape, during my watching-sessions. \
Why are the saiyans only ones capable of keeping themselves relevant to the story, by always being the most powerful... considering they all do the bloody same things, and despite the fact that they're the most worst monsters in the universe by birth, and still romanticized as an \"heroes\", because of their said powers?! \
Why can't namekians have something similar to that \"once in every millenia, when the stars collide in line\"- type of legend of god-like super-warriors? That being said... why can't humans have a mythos similar to that?! Why are the humans always so limited in every way imagined?! This is literaly a world, where the dragons grant wishes, kids turn into raging monkeys and moon can be blown to bits - twice! - with no repercussions! You would think, that some more asspulling and plot-devices wouldn't hurt that much, if the most diehard fans could get to see Tien or Piccolo keep their shits together, but NO! It's all about saiyans, and no one else!\
So, the \"story\" is not a big winner for me. But, I'm not gonna lie... this anime really started out for somehing, that most of the hardcore shonen fans still wank upon even to this very day! The popularity of this anime, launched out some pretty strong and persistent clishes and traits, that are still part of oh-so-many shonen ever made since, such as; \
(1) repetitive plots and stories\
(2) stupid heroes and insubtansial sidecast\
(3) tsundere/yandere women\
(4) endless amount of plot-devices/convienences/ Deus ex Machinas\
(4) bland/stupid/one-dimensional villains\
(5) endless amount of hissy-fit transformations\
(6) not-so-cool-sounding powers and/or attacks\
(7) overly stretched-out fights\
(8) actions having no long-term consequenses\
So, if you ever feel like complaining that most of the shonen animes on this day suffer immensely of any of these traits - or others! - blame DBZ! After all, it was so popular, because of these traits! This is the anime, that made all of those traits stick and stay, but unfortunately, most of the fandom of shounen can't be bothered to argue, since complaining about these bugs would be the same as pointing the angry fingers at their beloved power-porn- fantasies! These traits do have their fans, sure and true, but I am certainly not one of them! Being Me, who's favourite stories/plots/characters can be found from such titles like FMA:B, Death Note, Madoka Magica, Fruits Basket and Moomins, this anime doesn't meet neither my preferences, nor my standards for good quality, as a mindless, pointless, repetitive, power-obsessed shonen smack-down, and story-wise lacking even worse than some of those B-rated porn-movies! The story is not deep, it's not immaginative, it's not smart, and given how shallow, repetitive, bare-boned and bland it is, and how many arcs and episodes this anime has to repeat the exact same plots, traits, convienences and devices over and over again, it just can't please me, in the slightest.\
\
Art (3)\
The art is very difficult for me to critizise, let alone write about, since it holds such a little importance to me. All I care about in anime are the stories, characters and enjoyment, but, since I have so say atleast something...\
The art is ugly. Very, very ugly. Some of the character designs and backgrounds look nice, but most of the time, they're just some empty, desolated wastelands, and giant craters, and basically every single move, attack and technique looks like the wreaking same thing, over and over again! There's no variation to the coreography - something, that should hold such a high ground, in any fighting-oriented anime! - and most of the time, the fights themselves are just so fast and blurried, that you can't even see them! All I see are some pows and explosions, and being so spoiled from FMA:B's fights, I'm just not satisfied! \
And the characters themselves... what a mess they are! I've always said, that if you took every single protagonist from Miyasaki-movies, and took their hair and clothes off, they would look exactly the same! Well... the same thing goes with these empty blocks of muscles, since theyr'e all build the same, they pose the same way, and they all grin the same way! Hell, they all even fight the same way, since most of them already know the basic attacks, like the solar flare and kamehameha! They just shout out some stupid shonen-typed-awesome-sounding-not-so-well-varied- attack-names, that all look exactly the same, and do almost exactly the same things - blow shit up! This is not good. Not good! \
\
Sound (2)\
The sounds are... guite horrendous, if you ask me! I can't remember any of the musical tracks, and what I can remember from the voice actors was... well, not one of their brightest performances, to say the least! Most of the dialog is just some grunting, shouting and screaming, and whatever actual words there are, even the five-year-old could easily come up with! \
And don't even get me started on how badly the american dub messed up the original japanese script, to better sell these characters as a heroes, instead of bastards that they truly are - Goku and Vegeta, mainly. This is fanfiction-level of writing... as basic as any writing, or voice-acting gets, but let's face it... no one's gonna see this mess because of it's writing, right?! Like in any fanfiction, is all about fucking... erh, fighting!\
I do like, that my favourite voice-actor, Chris Sabat is being given so many roles in this one, but... does he really have to sound like a smoking frog, while playing Piccolo? I just don't get it. \
\
Characters (1)\
So many prases for the series stems from the characters, and how deep, multi-dimensional and interesting they all are, but to me, they all seem like a grey, dirty, non-appealing mess, that I almost thought that I was watching something totally unrecognizable mistake! The so-called \"heroes\"  - heroes of the circumstance, if anything else! - of ours, are ultimately just bunch of emotionally retarted, hyperactive and sadistic, psycothic, immoral and mentally unstable five-year- olds, in ludigrous grown-up bodies, with very little personality, absolutely no dimensions, little to no motivation, and absolutely no subtlety - I'm looking at you, Vegeta! Most of the \"heroes\" of the show, I would without any pain declare as monsters, because let's be honest... genocide is unforgivable, no matter how much the Fandom wants to romaticize it - *cough* Vegeta *cough*! And forgiving said genocider not once, but twice, is just as unforgivable, and should be aknowledged as such, instead of being heavily idolized and romanticized by the plot, and The Fandom - *cough* Goku *cough*! \
And speaking of Goku... he must be the absolute worst protagonist, that I've ever seen in any anime - shonen or not-shonen - ever, Vegeta holding a strong second place! Stupid, sadistic, irresponsible, borderline-sociopath, and every good deed he ever \"does\", happens by accident, or deus ex machinas, not because he actually wants to do good, for the sake of doing good - that would be, what an actual hero would do! Most of the Fandom that adores him, are only familiar with the american dub of him, which in many cases makes him see like this \"pure, angelic superman-character, who can do no wrong\", which is, of course, totally wrong - both japanese dub, and the manga, will prove my point, so I won't bother with it in this review with greater detail. Goku, and the shows over-praising attitude towards him, was one of the worst things that DBZ had to offer to me, and a painful trial to sit through! He's a terrible hero, terrible friend, horrible husband and father, cares only for himself and his needs to fight, has no integrity, and little to no moral nor empathy, when it comes to well-being and happines of others. Gokus popularity stems from the facts that his disgustingly OP, which is pathetich reason to be called a hero, let alone more-than-two-dimensional character... which he's not!\
And for the sake on continuity, let's talk about Vegeta for a beat! I know he's supposed to be the second - if not the first - fan-favourite of the series, who everyone either wants to be, or be with, and on some level, I can see why. Even Hitler had his fans, but... the less I say about that, the better. I won't go that much into detail of who Vegeta is as a character, but I do say this. He's not subtle. He starts out as a compleetely irredeemable psychopath, and suffers his consequenses, by dying on Namek by the man who quite literally was his surrogate father. But, because the Fandom loved him as a villain, he was brought back to life! He was even \"redeemed\" in the eyes of - most of - the Z-morons, when he no longer tried to kill any of them, which truly hurt me from the inside, when I first time saw this BS happen! The very same hoodwink happened with the Fandom as well! Did everyne just suddenly forgot, that this character is literally born to be irredeemable?! What gives this franchise any right to accuse, that a murderous psychos can be redeemed?! A few dropped tears and temporarily/meaninglesly dying by blowing himself up, while fighting against some pink bubblegum-monster, which he himself with Goku summoned voluntarily, isn't anywhere close to redemption in my books, so... why it is with everyone else?! Because Vegeta is a fanmade-character, and let me explain why! \
Everyone inside the Fandom are always raving about how he redeemed himself and how he \"was cured from his evil ways\", but I must ask... how was he redeemed, or cured, exactly? \
Really... how? \
Did he ever want to be redeemed? No! Did he ever came to regret his past as a genocider? No! His so-called redemption was given him by the Fandom, and nobody even blinked an eye on that, because \"anti-heroes with attitude are just so fecking cool\"! Everything he is, right after Namek, is a consequence of the Fandom interfering into Toriyaman's work - which, in my humble opinion, even he was never that skillful of doing - and literally make him anew, because apparently, genocide after genocide is not a wrong thing to do if you can still form tears from your eyes, and stupid teenage-girls just love the idea of dangerous psycho-murderer to be their ever-devoted-yet-off-puttingly-tsundere-ish boyfriend and for the love of feck I HATE THIS DISGUSTING CHARACTER! WHY ISN'T HE DEAD?!\
Vegeta is much like the poor Joker. Both of them are immoral irredeemable for the obvious reasons, and everyone with a half a brain can understand that, but both of them has this special little portion of Fandom that desperately tries to write them sort-of redeemable/redeemed sugarpies, with tender kisses and loving embraces with their hussies! Yuk! Vegeta, in my books, is a close second Worst Character Ever Made In Anime History, losing only sightly to Goku, and not necessarily because of who he is, but because how Toriyama/the Fandom are trying to make him look like, despite all the logic and morals fighting against it. The same problem happens with Goku! You can have a character, and let him be the most unlikable/irredeemable monster that ever existed, but don't treat him like a saint and hero that he's clearly not supposed to be! \
Vegeta isn't subtle. He's not redeemable, and he's NOT any deeper, nor multi-dimentional, than the rest of these trainwrecks-of-a-characters!\
The actual villains of the show aren't any better. The villains are only there, for the sake of being there, and their, as well as most of our \"heroes\" only motivations, are either selfish materialism, childish swagger, or yolo - nothing else! Except for Frieza! If anything else, he was a hero, for liberating the entire Universe from the plague called the saiyans, and that's saying something, when the \"hero\" of the story, is indeed saiyan himself!\
And these are the characters, who are still idolized, and praised and worshiped by many... I wonder, why.\
Oh, but I really shouldn't be too harsh! I mean... why would any of these characters use their brains to think and proceed as a coherent characters, when the premise or the retarted story/plot itself doesn't let them?! Nobody on the so-said \"protag\"- side ever got fitting punishment for the murders, abductions, sexual assaults, eating people, thefts and other general dickery they've ever done, in the past or the present, and we're not supposed to care any of this, because... the story doesn't, the Fandom doesn't, Toriyama sure as Hell doesn't, and neither does any of these blockhead-characters! \
Nothing's ever lost, since but a single wish can just conjure it right back, and if it somehow can't, there's always some way to bend the rules and come up with another Deux ex Machina-type of asspull! No pain equals to gain, and when you'll never ever have to lose anything substantial, there's really no need to learn one's mistakes, and grow as a character! Which is a sin, that happens over and over again, saga after saga, proceeding as follows; \
All the \"heroes\" are either stupid, men, or disgustingly immoral aliens, or both, and if there's any women to be seen, they're either annoying tomboys, bitches, or brainles baby machines, breeding cubs for ex-murderes, and sosiopathic man-children! Something happens, but later on, it just happens to be pointless and/or useless, since the plot is literaly writen by the hoarding fans, through fan-mail! Plot-devices and convenient DeM's are constantly overused and re-used, until they're either forgotten, milked dry, or turned into \"buy your new super saiyan transformation here!\"- type of jokes! If something bad happens - in a story, or in between the characters - it's overlooked and then just as easily forgotten, since realism holds no ground on this anime, and relationships/traumas/consequenses have nothing to do with a fighting in this world! The plot is stupid, so the characters are stupid, and it's all just laughs and giggles in the end, with no one dead and no grudges being held!\
What I love in every anime even more, than a deep and smart story and plot, I love the character-interactions and bonding, that evolves and developes the plot without feeling forced or implausible. But, as much as I tried to see the friendships, the bonds and the respect between the characters and the couples, as the \"story\" followed, I just couldn't see any. \
Why would Piccolo need any companionship from Gohan, if he truly is this \"evil by heart\", and haven't ever shown any actual sign of loneliness, nor need for companions in his live? Why would Chi Chi stay together with a man, who leaves her as a single mother-widow in multiple occasions with ease, just to please his own selfish desires, in a cost of a happines of his own family? Why would Vegeta ever be accepted in the group of \"heroes\", considering what he's done, and when he shows no actual interest to remorse, or change his ways? Why would Gohan ever respect an scary alien, who for a years has planned to kill his father, later on killed his father, then kidnapped and tortured him for a year in a wastelands, and afterwards basically stayed far away from his live, until it was being threatened, yet again? Why would Bulma - who's not a murderer, nor crazy - ever fall for a alien, who's utter and complite psycho and a murderer, has a severe inferiority complex, antisocial personality disorder, and is overally just some really disgusting, prideful asshole, with absolutely no redeeming gualities? That being said... why are the saiyans, expecially Vegeta among them, represented as these \"tragic heroes, enslaved by Frieza\", when all they ever truly were, was these exploited, barbaric murderers?! There's nothing tragic about them - just some poetic justice being done, and that's it! I said it once, and I'll say it again - Frieza was a hero, for killing them, end of story!\
These are just a few of the burning questions, that were never answered to me during the show, but luckily, there's always fanfiction!\
The cast itself, doesn't seem like truly united, in my opinion, when it comes to dynamics between characters. Most of the time, the whole cast of characters just seemed to be \"on the same side against the much bigger evil\", and not much else. If there's any warmth or respect ever felt or seen between any of them, is either very limited, or almost non-extintant... which is, to me, the complite opposite from the cast of deep, multi-dimensional and interesting characters! Which is, I guess, just as fell, since the only characters, that get any development - in power, that is - are the saiyans, leaving humans and other aliens to either be victims in the gutter, stupid jokes, or eye candy for a girls... or girly boys. \
Most of these relationships would be - in real life, or in complitely different franchise - either out of place, implausible, or downright insulting/ludicrous, and the reason why they work so well in this franchise, is because they are contantly and superficially being glamourized, and idealized, done pretty much more or less because of the retarted plot and overall idioticy. \
The plot doesn't want to go into the dark places, that in any other franchise it would, because most of these situations would be impossible to avoid, but still, somehow, it still seems to hold some of them most \"believable\", \"deepest\", and \"truest\" lovestories ever made in any other anime... at least, according to the fans! And sure, I can see it too, now! Of course mortal enemies can be friends! Of course a evil alien can have his best buddy from a son of his latest victim! Of course any sane woman would be so hellbend to stay with her first childhood-crush, that she wouldn't even think about getting a devorse at some point, even if the said man is gonna stay away from her life for good, and voluntarily never come back! Of course the son of the said man would still adore and love said man as his father, even if he's just gonna die soon anyway, or just leave! Of course the said man can throw his 11-year-old child to the wolfs, smile from afar, die and leave his family for seven-or-so years, and still be welcomed back as a beloved \"angel\" that he obviously is... not! Of course the formal villains get to stay with the heroes, if they won't kill any of the main cast, and if they happen to bank themselves a respectable tail in the process, all the better - no atonements needed! Of course any sane, hybristophilic woman would both copulate and live together with a murderous psychopath, who has no mental blocks to not to do whatever he wants to do, kill whoever he wants to, or just leave, whenever he feels like it! And... since, I am a girl, and we are in the subject of the parrel, we better get this over with...\
The relationships/plot-convienences! The very first thing, that I learned from the Fandom about the subject,, was that \"Vegeta and Bulma are like the Beauty and the Beast of anime couples!\" \
Bullshit they are! \
Beauty and the Beast took some time to take to know each other, and respect each other! All these two did, was to scream, and insult each other! Call me horrible person, but that's not a relationship, that you bring your kids in... let alone marriage! I myself, personally, would feel sick to my very soul, if I had to even share my livingspace with a dangerous murderer, let alone be married with him... and Bulma does both of those, without as much as a blink of an eye! That's downright misogynist, and just highlights the common attitude towards women in general, in shonen-genre! And hey, guess what... they don't even look each other, let alone touch eatch other, so drop that affection-BS right now! Goku and Chi Chi - still being far from a healthy couple in my books - still could talk to each other, and even hug each other, but these two... ugh! \
I'm going to be completely honest here, and speak this through, since this clearly is the aspect on the show, that so strongly revolts me. The very concept of Vegeta/Bulma- relationship, and the fact that the Fandom still thinks, that it's both believable, plausible, and admirable - something, that could be considered as a \"perfect example of a perfect, loving couple\" - truly makes me sick to my stomach! If I'm really living in a world, where Toriyama's take on romtantic love, can be equivalented on these two, I never want to love anything ever again!\
Vegeta is, as a horribly damaged and disgusting person, literaly incapable of loving anyone, or caring about anything, but because Toriyama can't write and the plot is retated, he's sorta like \"healed\", or \"reformed\" later on for all of this, by god knows how, because of plot-convienences, and mind-numbinlgly insulting \"love and care can turn even a Satan into a good side\"- type of thinking! Vegeta was a murderer, who never regretted anything, and never ever wanted to redeem himself, or felt any kind of remorse, but still, the Fandom wants to see him as this \"tough guy with the heart of gold\", and it disgusts me! Bulma is sane woman - not bearable by any means, but sane... although hybristophilic... gross! - and she has a working brain to think with, so... why should she ever even look at the monster, who has no appealing character traits, nor appealing contributes... outside of her questionable tendencies to tend to want to sleep with dangerous murderers?! Oh, I know! Because of the retarted plot, fan-beloved Vegeta needing some... whatever reason to stay on Earth, and because of Bulmas Florence Nightingale- effect/hybristophilia... among the other stupidity! \
It's kinda like this Joker and Harlequin- scenario, where two loonies find each other, and are utterly horrible people together - another pairing, that I cnanot support as a \"romantic ad healthy couple\" - but, Bulma isn't a horrible person, per say, and she could've easily have much, much better... if she even truly ever needed a man in her life to beging with! This pairing was, of course made, so that Toriyama could have more saiyans on the board to overblow this overused super saiyan- gimick of his, and it could've worked fine, if Bulma was just as crazy, disgusting and insane like Vegeta is, but no! This just isn't working! People, who openly enjoy killing and murdering, with no remorse nor empathy, aren't just cured because of TLC and off-screen sex, but, those who still adore this couple, clearly aren't on the same mind-level, like me, to comprehend that!\
It was fun time to mess around with the Rule 34, but it's time to wake up. Bulma and Vegeta are a pairing, because Toriyama needes - for some reason! - some more characters in his already overloaded cast! They never were, nor they're not meant to be a pair, let alone \"in love\", and they're sertainly not a pairing, that you should in any way admire. If you do... I feel sorry for you. I truly do. \
Goku and Chi Chi is... well... strange, to say the least. So are Videl and Gohan. Chi Chi - the misogynist joke of a woman - just decided as a child to marry him, even though Goku - sadistic, selfish, ignorant asshole - is just as horrible as a person, like Vegeta is, and then, saga after saga, it's just lonely, bitter and empty live of a baby-making machine for her, while her husband is either dead, training, fighting, or training and fighting while being dead! And the saddest part is, that no one questions this, or atleast mentions this... ever! If I was in Chi Chis shoes, it would be about one time only, when Goku's not willing to return back home from the death to his wife and child, and after that, I would say \"I'm done! Do not even bother to come back anymore!\" But hey, where's all glamoured idealization in that? In the perfect, idealized world, a man can be just as stupid/selfish/immature/sadistic monster as he likes, because he's friends accept it and his family is going to blindly love him in either way, and even better, he can endanger his/his family's lifes for more than one occasions, be gone for more than seven years, simply because he wants to, and even then, he can - and will - be greeted and welcomed back with a smile and the open arms! In this world, even a monster like Vegeta can easily have a woman and a child with no so much more than a time-skip, and after that, he's being called a \"good guy\" for there on out! They do are much, much more tolerable, and much more plausible, than Bulma and Vegeta ever were, but still... overly-glamoured idealization is still all over the place! Videl and Gohan were just some rushded surprise-bump behind the corner, and not even very interesting bump to that! They're high school-sweethearts, and if I know anything about of how nicely that's gonna some day work out for them... well... there's enough of that in fanfiction's Piccohan-section, I assume.\
Then, lastly, Krillin and 18. My fave. No, honestly, it is! I liked character of an 18, since she had the attitude, and the spunk. Krillin is just... nice. He's nice, I give him that. And, he seems to be pretty much the only one out of the cast, who doesn't treat women as objects, or who isn't too deep in that \"I'm strong macho man, I need no women around me!\"- gay-closet, that so many others in this macho-club seems to be stuffed in. AND, he atleast says, that he loves his woman, which is something that's almost never ever heard of, in the whole franchise! But, sadly, this pairing isn't without it's own idealization, either. When 18 was a single, she was awesome - her own person, indepented and strong. When Krilling fell for her, she became a plot-devise. When she became a mother and a wife, she became totally dispensable.\
So, in a summary; Goku and Chi Chi was like 'friends with benefits', Vegeta and Bulma like the landlady, and murderous, disgusting tenant, who should have stayed dead on Namek, and should have burned to alive, repeatedly, for all I care! Krillin and 18 where the typical case of trophy wife, and a loser husband - insert the '18 as a baby machine'- joke here - and Gohan and Videl felt more like brother and sister to me... gross! Obviously, this show wasn't ment to have anything else but fighting and training, and just as well, romance doesn't fit into that mold. Idealization and retarted plot is truly needed, to pull some of these parinigs off, and as a woman myself, I can't say that I can approve any of this.\

Enjoyment (1)\
As I've already said time and time again, I really did hate this peace of turd. For the lowest common denominator, this indeed is the absolute best than can ever exist in the world of anime, but me... I already now much better works, than this one. \
And let me say this, right here and now! Akira Toryjama is a interesting artist, but a terrible writer, and even worse stroyteller, and really should just stick with his poop jokes. \
To me, this anime was like that shitpie, from The Help. You know? First, I was promised to have this delicious pie, that I thought had everything, that any great pie should have - the looks, the taste, and the overall enjoyment, of the... well, pie! So I took the spoonful, and said myself \"Well, it's not good, but if I keep eating it, prehaps I get used to it!\" So I did, and I kept eating and eating, and ultimately getting myself sick just by realizing, how much more I still had to go through! So I asked, what was this pie made of, and I was given a simple answer, \"My shit!\" So I vomited, and cried, and prayed for any God or Devil to come and take me away to death, so I woudn't hurt no more! There's really no rhyme, nor reason, for why this anime got so many 10/10, in my humble, totally buttfucked opinion - smells like nostalgia-blinded fans, brown nosing all over the place! It's like seeing the fans of this series eating the same shitpie, while still enjoying themselves to the fullest, and you know that the pie is made of shit, but you can't say anything, or you'll get a sporke in your eye! It's sad, and it's pathetic, and it's really... really disgusting, and I feel so bad for them... for actually liking to eat someones shit! Shitpie, that's actually - and I'm not kidding - five times too long, compared to it's totally hollow substance! Any competent writer could have told a story as shallow and empty such as this, with 50 or so- episodes, with ease, and still leave some of that oh-so-beloved filler in! \
Majority of people like mindlesness - not needing to think, or use their minds, when they can just find a easiest way possible to entertain themselves for a while, which mostly is explosions and violence. For that, and for that purpose alone, DBZ is indeed unparralleled. It's shallow and repetitive, and yet at the same time full of that mind-numbning violence and power-porno, that most of it's targeted demographic - the lowest common denominator - loves so much, thus somehow keeping it alive decades later... much like all those old fighting-games, with no plot but tons of blood and jiggly boobies! As much as I too would like to be lenient towards mindlesness, I really cannot find any real value, nor entertainment, that would satisfy me in any way. \
I already listed some of my favourite anime-works on this review, and compared to those, DBZ boths seems, and feels like an empty husk, with decent colors, but no real substance, or triggers to keep my mind just as interested of what I'm seeing, like in FMA:B, or Madoka Magica. I want to be invested! I want to feel what I'm seeing in front of me, and think what I'm being subjected to - both bad, and the good! Not for once, did DBZ ever managed to come even close to that same level of quality that I demand from my entertainment, and so, it will forever be to me, the absolute worst anime, that I've ever seen. Period.\
So, obviously, to me, this was a really painful to watch! The only reason, why I'm even giving the generous 1 to this... anime, is beause it's the lowest rating, that I can give on this scale! I even refuse to be shocked, or even surprised, that this was even more succsesful, than the first DB series was, because apparently, when entertaining fans of violence and power-porno, the lowest of the low in the barrel of shitty entertainment, is like a barrel of gold to them! Anything goes, as long as it has mucles, explosions, and painfully/obviously virgin man-children - no girls allowed in our Big-boy- club of epic constipation! \
\
Overall (1)\
Despite what I was told for so many, many many times before my times of suffering, this turd has absolutely nothing to offer for me, or those, who expect a great deal from shows they deside to invest their time on. DBZ is popular, that I can admit, but popularity does not equal quality, and even though this anime is still being referred to as \"the Grandfather of all anime\", expecially shounen, that's not really something that I can call a praise, let alone achievement. Dragon Ball- franchise as a whole, left behind a terrible legacy, that sadly still goes on strong, relishing in shallow/incompetent writing, two-dimensional characterization, and overall laziness, for the amusement of the lowest common denominator.\
For me, this anime took way too much, and offered nothing in return, despite all of my efforts to try to find something good out of it. Only some hot air, trapped inside some nice, yet stupid-looking balloon, that you just want to pop to see, if the air inside really stinks like a turd! No deep stories, no complex and multi-dimensional - or even likable - characters, no subtle, or believable development, and no philosophical, meaningful morals or thoughts to find from anywhere! Only a story so paper-thing that you can see right through it, disconnected, empty plot, truly disgusting relationships, and mind-level/writing skills of a fanfiction. Maybe I was hoping for too much, but honestly, the show titled as \"the best anime ever made\" should've easily been able to deliver! And sadly, it didn't!\
I wouldn't recommend this anime even as a punishment, for my worst enemy - even I can be merciful at times! - and if you really want to see, in a nutshell, what this anime has to offer in it's core, go to the youtube, and watch that whole fucking 4 1/2 hours long fight between carrotcake and that metrosexual, albino lizard, and then proceed to the TFS's by far better parodies... if your brain hasn't escaped yet! \

Dont get me wrong. The story is repetetive, the art is outdated and honestly ugly, the sound is in bad quality and it doesnt have much music. The quality of this anime doesnt stand a chance to amazing animes like FMA, Code Geass and many others. But this anime is still legendary. \
This was the father of anime, it was one of the first animes that really got popular in the western culture. Its maybe the most popular anime ever. And without it, we might not have all the amazing animes we have today. I mean, its from the 80s! many people remember DBZ\
          \
        from their childhoods, with the memorable characters and awesome villains. Thats why you shouldnt compare this anime to todays amazing animes, this doesnt stand a chance! But the enjoyment is real, and the impact it did on the anime culture is legendary. And to me, this is the anime that is the nearest to my heart. So please, dont hate on this anime, it doesnt deserve that. And lets be honest here, which aniem fan doesnt remember Goku?\

    Lets make this short and sweet. DBZ is not a good anime. Do NOT let nostalgia get in your way of analyzing this anime. There is so much filler, the plot is rinse and repeat with no character growth, and the battles literally take like 50 episodes to finish.\
 Lets start with the story... Bad guy comes, kills a bunch of people, one of the main heroes dies, power of family and friendship saves the day... and all the people get revived. Over and over and over. A plus is that the art and sound were good for the time, but they have not aged\
          \
        well.\
If you want to experience Goku's story, I recommend reading the manga, which is actually good. Lastly, do NOT watch the piece of shit that is kai.\

    Intro\
This is my favourite out of Dragoball / Z / GT, Dragonball Z was the first one I could get ahold of, so for me, watching Dragonball was like watching Star wars the originals then phantom menace etc came out years later.\
Story\
Story is good, drags out a little but good if you get into it, you will be disappointed the episodes come to an end. Although the same thing happens, bad guy comes, people defend, the fight sequences and opponents are mostly unique to their powers and reasons to wanting to conquer Earth. This pretty much keeps it unique.\
Animation\
The animation is pretty good, can't fault\
          \
        it to the most part, animation not as good as GT but it's still pretty good.\
Sound\
The sound is good, I liked it at the most. Music came in at the right time, the opening theme changed with the Saga's which  I liked, really portrayed the anime as action packed.\
Characters\
Good characters, advancing on the same idea as Dragonball with a bit more kick and intensity. few more kick ass characters with varying personalities. Many characters have their personalities develop slightly though out the anime too, although this is arguable when compared to deeper anime.\
Enjoyment\
I really enjoyed this especially the Freiza (if that's spelled correct) and Cell Saga's. Very re-watchable.\
Overall\
Overall, a good anime, it's action packed with a decent story, varying characters with various different flaws, few suprises and twists which should keep you interested. Not as detailed as the manga but it's still an overall great anime.\

    Dragon Ball Z is an anime that many grew up with, like me. Others grew up with anime like Saint Seiya or even Sailor Moon. Personally I am extremely glad I ended up with DBZ.\
Nowadays you don't get anime like this. Without it, anime would not be where it is today. I am a major DBZ fan so I will try not to be too biased.\
This is an anime where the weak rise up against the strong and eventually win in most cases. The main protagonist Goku is the best example of all. He first begins as a low level Saiyan but then ends becoming\
          \
        one who's talent is endless.\
The never ending action occurring for several episodes just keeps your heart pounding. I assure you that there is no other anime out there that can even come close to comparing to the fight scenes in DBZ. Can you imagine mixing comedy and action and for it to turn into a huge success? The story never gets boring and is easy to follow. Each major arch takes around 80-90 episodes or so.(Frieza, Cell, Buu)\
The sound is just amazing. You hear every impact made. They really put a lot of effort into every single detail so that it would sound more realistic. Every time I hear a blast I get goose bumps.\
Art....PERFECT!!!!! You cannot tell that it is an anime from the 80s. It is that good. Honestly it just blew my mind when I started comparing it to other anime in the 90s! This anime dominated the art department until the 21st century.\
The characters are extremely unique. Not very often do you get saiyans who eat and fight all the time. Not to mention a bold person with 6 dots on his forehead and dies countless times because of his rotten luck. They is a great sense of rivalry, comedy and a hint of romance which occurs in the latter half. The best characters in my book.\
Everything about this anime is just astounding. The story just gets better and better as it goes along and wacky things keep occurring which just make you laugh till you cry. You don't need to be a crazy fan to enjoy this, nor an action fan. Just an anime fan. \
P.S This anime is the only one in the world where the english dubbed version greatly surpasses the japanese version. Some may disagree but I am certain that the majority will agree.\

    I really rate it 10/10 in all categories. IT was just a masterpiece, especially for its time. The story is debateable, but the art, sound, character, enjoyment was flawless without contest.\
ART\
The art was amazing, it was so interesting and the fighting scenes got me hooked. \
SOUND\
Lot of people complain about the sound/music in DBZ sounding too \"old\" and preferred the american bruce falconer versions. I disagree STRONGLY. I felt the original sound and music fit PERFECTLY, there's no words to describe it. Every theme was amazing.\
CHARACTER\
This is one of the things that made DBZ one of the most memorable and watched series, the characters. Just\
          \
        how unique can they be? I can picture goku, vegeta, krilling, piccolo OR any of the character 10 years after watching the show and still remember them perfectly. If that's not a masterpiece, i don't know what is! Generic and bland characters is something that is overwhelming nowadays in animes. Every character tend to look/act like the one before, the uniqueness is out the window.\
ENJOYMENT\
Boy did i enjoy it as a kid. I remember being able to watch only 10 minutes of it in the morning before going to school and finishing the last portion of it on the later re-run, that's how enjoyable it was!\
This is hands down THE best fighting/action series with naruto at a close second. It is NOT a deep anime like Elfen Lied or Evangelion, so don't expect psychological thrillers. DBZ is all about the \"cool\" factor.\
10/10. Masterpiece.\

    Wait this is weird. Why so many bad scores for an anime you obviously enjoyed?\
The thing is, a review is supposed to be objective. This is pretty hard when it comes to Dragonball Z. It's like talking about an ex-girlfriend. You loved her back in the days but now you don't cherish her like you used to do. DBZ was one of my first anime series ever and I was crazy about this show when I was a child. Now after almost 20 years I must say I like this show a lot yes but after having seen so many other anime shows I can't\
          \
        say that Dragonball Z lives up to the hype even though I still have awesome memories related to this show.\
Dragonball Z has so many flaws I can't even decide where to begin.\
Story: First of all the story. While Dragonball (where Goku is a kid) is a very lively show where many different things happen in a short period of time and is filled with interesting characters and events Dragonball Z basically consists of two ridiculously powerful guys staring and screaming at each other for hours until one of them get's defeated or even killed just to come back from the dead to continue to scream and stare at the guy who killed him.\
There are some brief moments where the story shines but let's face it: it is not a good story.\
Art: The art is one of the things that made DBZ shine back in the days. Toriyamas style is unique and all those places and the world he created are just so iconic for shonen anime. Each location, house, technical device and character is enshrined in the memory of millions of people worldwide. It is anime history.\
Sound: DBZ has so many memorable tunes that I kept humming as a child and I still do as an adult. Like the art, the sound of DBZ is unforgettable but it consists of only a few repetitive themes. \
Characters: Yes, also the characters in DBZ are unforgettable. But after over 291 episodes they became their own stereotype. Except for Piccolo and Vegeta, they do not have any true motivation for trying to become stronger and stronger and do not have any interesting twists. They don't really develop (except for Piccolo and Vegeta) and they barely surprise you as the show goes on.\
The story is mostly focussing on Goku and sometimes on the other Sayans while many loved human characters from Dragonball just become irrelevant sidekicks who stand beside the battlefield cheering for Goku.\
Enjoyment: If you have not watched this anime yet, you are either very young or you just started being interested in anime/manga. \
In both cases let me say this: you probably won't enjoy this anime as much as I did when I was a kid or any other old fan did back then.\
There are far more complex titles out there now. This anime is history. A little dusty, a little old and somehow likeable but many younger fresher ideas have now set higher standards in story-telling, character development, art and sound. If you really want to see this anime I recommend you to watch Dragonball Kai. It is a reworked DBZ where all those seemingly endless scenes of people staring and screaming at each other without anything interesting happening are cut out.\

    Can I make a critical review of DBZ?\
Can I be the party pooper?\
Can I piss in your cereal bowl?\
Thank you.\
DBZ is bad. It's actually very much to shonen what Final Fantasy 7 is to JRPG. It's origin of the Bad, the birth of it, the Genesis of modern shonen shit. It is to Nekketsu what SAO is to Isekai, the biggest and most recognisable of them all, and also the one that carries all its flaws.\
Like Naruto, like Bleach, like One Piece(and I really like One Piece), like Mc Donalds food, there is a general trend with Life that when a lot of people like\
          \
        something, it's probably shit. Not because \"it sold out\", although that's usually there too, but simply because when you call upon the lowest common denominator, you usually appeal to everyone - and also suck.\
To be absolutely fair, I read the manga to the end and watched numerous hours of the anime, but not all of it. Still, knowing the story and knowing what the anime's like, I feel like I can judge the anime as a whole without having tortured myself with watching it all.\
Still, before I get to the meat of why DBZ is shit, I'll break it down into three aspects:\
- The fights (the technical standpoint, in other words just \"how are the fights\")\
- The battles (from a character standpoint, in other words \"why are the fights\")\
-  The general style of Toriyama as a writer and as an artist. \
I usually break down into the MAL points of story, art etc, but I don't think it's very pertinent here. Story keeps getting worse, Art is Toriyama with the Toriyama Faces and the Toriyama Haircuts that are in every Toriyama Game and every Toriyama manga, sound is alright when it comes to music (delicious SSJ3 theme), voice acting...not so much sometimes, characters are alright, rarely good though, and it's enjoyable, if you're stupid and haven't gargled on years of shonens already. \
Overall, the result is really really poor.\
And since that conclusion has no relationship to the earlier points, that's why I'm doing another breakdown.\
Father of all Fighter Shonens and Patriarch of the Modern Nekketsus, thine  fights are pure shit. Technically speaking.\
Looking at any battle in the DBZ manga or anime, one thing should immediately strike you if you're used to this style: it has near to absolutely no technicality. By which I mean there is just no techniques. Fights aren't won by outsmarting the enemy, tricking him, using a special technique that surprises him, or overcoming his defenses in any way. Well to be fair that does happen in one fight, the Vegeta fight, which I consider to be the last true Dragon Ball fight there is. Everything else is DBZ.\
So if DBZ doesn't care for techniques, how are fights made? Simple: by power level.\
\"My numbers are bigger than yours.\"\
Now by itself, that sounds pretty boring. It's just the start.\
While the whole number thing during the Vegeta and Freeza arcs are reaaaaaaally boring and have the same impact as the midichlorians in Star Wars 1 (making the Force leave the mystical realm and enter a stupid pseudoscience realm that kills the purpose of a magical super-physical force), they at least respect a certain degree of sense. There is logic in them, even if the whole \"my numbers are bigger than yours\" is really, REALLY poor.\
But then, in the later arcs, the whole power level thing, which by then isn't represented by scouters or calculators but by Super Saiyan level, reaches an absolutely retarded degree.\
Here's my main gripe with it.\
When you say \"THE LEGENDARY SUPAH SAYAEN\" to Freeza, and you say he's the mightiest in the Universe.\
And then you pull out a SUPAH SAYEEN TSU.\
And then you pull a SUPRA SYEAHEAN SREEE.\
And later on, a 4 and a Blue and a what the hell ever, then that's called changing the rules when they don't suit you anymore. Which denotes lack of vision and lack of respect for your own world rules, which in turn destroys the validity of the world which you've set up.\
So the power levels end up being inconsequential because power and saiyan levels will just be broken time and time and time again anyway. And they're also the only real defining element of your fights winners and losers...that means that you basically don't have rules. Whenever you want a fight to look hard, just have your player get beaten hard by the villain, and have all the nekketsu friends/supporters/arena cleaners scream OH NO, FREEZA/CELL/BUU IS SO STRONG! And when it's time to finish that fight, have your hero have a monologue, or see something bad (like Krillin getting blasted) or just DBZ's ultimate bullshit technique, have him be beaten to a pulp which if he's Saiyen means he immediately gets a huge powerup, and then fight the villain again and win!\
Except you won't win, because then Cell will get his new form, or Buu will eat something or spit something, or Freeza will get from form 1 to 2, to 3, to 4, to Cyborg, to Golden Freeza, to whatever suits you to make the fight last, and then your heroes will reach a new level of Saiyan or craaaaaaap, I think my point is made.\
This complete lack of technical effort or even base cleverness is atrocious. Even in the fights themselves, there's no martial arts strikes or positions, it's two idiots, usually levitating in midair, which is REALLY CONVENIENT to think new positions and new forms of fighting, but it's two idiots looking at each other punching each other in the chest until one of them gets blasted and finds his IT'S NOT EVEN MY FINAL FOOOOOORM card in his landing hole.\
It's just atrocious as hell. To be fair, I didn't even like Dragon Ball that much, but DB had merit in creativity sometimes, even if it shared its problems with DBZ, it at least tried to create interesting situations, the fight with Tenshinhan comes to mind, where the ending was surprising. DBZ wallows in that swamp of mediocrity with the power levels or saiyan levels where everything is just about making a bigger freaking energy laser. There is no technique growth, no new styles, nothing, just get beaten more, lift more weights, do more pushups till you can reach Ultra Maximum Over Saiyan ++ ² Blue With Spiky Ass Hair.\
But most shonens aren't about the fights technically, they're about the reasons behind the fights. Everyone has some kind of villainous reason to be a villain, everyone of the heroes has a virtous reason to be virtous.\
DBZ cast: please state your reasons.\
Goku : I like fighting!\
Gohan : Well uh dad likes fighting so I guess I have to too.\
Tenshinhan, Bulma, Yamcha, Krillin, and all the gang: Well err I guess they want to destroy the Earth and we kinda live here.\
Vegeta : It is my race's duty and pride to trample our enemies!\
Piccolo : I like Gohan, he's the son I never had.\
So excluding the growing gang of sidekicks that have been pretty useless since Dragon Ball ended, we have : I like to fight, I have to cause dad, and two characters with actual freaking reasons that don't come from \"we have to\" or \"I just like it man\".\
As for the villains:\
Freeza : I am evil and love to conquer and kill. Also, I snark. Hin hin.\
Cell : I am evil and was programmed to kill. Also, I snark. Mmmh mmh.\
Buu: My master is evil and I was created to kill. Also, I eat. Nom nom\
I mean really.\
REALLY.\
That's it. That's what people worship. What the hell is wrong with simple characters with clear motivations? Nothing really, except what I said earlier about how to appeal to most people: you go for the lowest common denominator! Every good guy is good because he has no choice, or because he likes it. The two exceptions of Vegeta and Piccolo are laudable and I do appreciate them a lot, but that does not excuse an entire cast of generic \"no choice but to do it!\" characters.\
As for the villains it's even worse! They're literally anime villains in the worst sense: evil because they are, killing and hurting because it's fun. By rule, the hero should be admirable and the villain should be enjoyable. You should want the hero to win, but enjoy everything the villain does and think \"oh boy, I wish I could do that too!\".\
But with these pathetic excuses for characters, there is no ideological fight, or even an emotional fight. It's a good guy who's good who gets beaten by a bad guy who's bad, until he reaches his next step of power level then he wins until a new villain or new form comes up. I know DBZ is the basis of modern nekketsu, I know it's normal to find that in the basis of Nekketsu, but does it have to be the ONLY THING that the battles have? There's nothing here! Nothing! I'm just baffled that people still praise this today! I mean if you watched this when you were 8, sure, of course at 8 you'd praise this schlock, but by now the fad really should've died out and under the fog of undeserved praise the drooling fanboys made, you should see the real thing: a fighting anime with bad fights, with unstable world rules, with no real value in the fights because it's just good guys being good and bad guys being bad. It's the most generic of the generic to the point that it's utterly boring.\
And lastly I think the Toriyama part has to be also targeted. Toriyama is a lazy mangaka. He goes for the easy route and doesn't really care. Things like \"I made the Super Saiyan Blonde because I was too lazy to draw it black\" come to mind, but even beyond that, the guy has problems.\
As I said about the fighting, nothing has consequences because no matter how beaten a hero is, a god, a super god, a super super god, a super super super god, or a senzu bean, will come save them. The fights are pointless because nothing has consequences.\
The whole rules about power or saiyan levels also don't mean a thing because out of nowhere a new level, form, or whatever will shuffle the chess pieces again.\
And if you look at it in detail, whether it's in time travel, power level, character motivations (Vegeta and his desire to be the Saiyan Emperor come to mind), nothing EVER has any consequences. Time travel ultimately don't mean much, they could rewrite all of History, kill Cell or the Androids before they're born, but they just make sure that the fights can happen as planned without Goku dying. Character motivations with Vegeta being incredibly arrogant and ambitious mean nothing because ultimately it's always down to the guys having to band together to defeat the villains. \
There is no choice that matters, no moment that cannot be undone.\
After the Cell arc, Toriyama wanted to kill off Goku for good, and for Gohan to become the new MC. He wanted a new age for DBZ, a new history. The fans rejected that so bad his editor forced him to bring back Goku again.\
I don't blame him for his editor or his fans. But the fact that he could even do that in the first place after numerous layers of reasons as to why he couldn't do it, is proof in itself that he built a completely inconsequential world with inconsequential rules.\
And a story without consequences is boring. DBZ is boring. DB was boring. Never in DB, or anything Toriyama, did I ever feel like stakes were high. Because no matter what, the man never wants to engage himself. He stays in the comfort zone of breaking his own rules when it suits him, never needing vision of what he's gonna have to do.\
It's a lazy mangaka with lazy writing techniques to never commit to any story, which makes it all feel fake. It's also a lazy artist with always the same faces every time. Dragon Ball suffered a lot from it. It had creativity, and some value, and was certainly fun. Toriyama also has this unpleasant, and yet very popular, inbetween chairs mix of comedy and fighting.\
You can be tremendously funny and very serious in your fights. Slam Dunk or One Punch Man are solid examples of that. One Piece is also a solid example of how to not do that: in OP, the funny/silly definitely overtakes the serious, and that brings the fights' stakes down to the pits.\
Toriyama in DB and DBZ cannot stop being silly. He cannot stop having the lighthearted, consequence free brand of Toriyama silly. He can't just take it seriously for once. Maybe very rarely, when Goku goes Super for the first time, you might think shit hit the fan and now we're into the realm of Real Stuff.\
But soon after, Goku will go \"meh, boring\" and try to leave. All hard emotions and serious stakes, avenging Krillin, saving the Universe, meh that stuff's too heavy to be funny, so let's drop it. Freeza won't even have to be killed by Goku, that'd be too heavy too, it'd have consequences, Goku would be a killer and not the fun monkey anymore, Toriyama doesn't want that...so he just lets Freeza kill himself with a Kienzan.\
Sure, it looks like a self-inflicted lesson about violence. But at the same time, it only happens because Toriyama doesn't want to carry the weight of Goku being a killer. Just like he doesn't want Vegeta, the self-proclaimed Napoleon of Space, Ruler of a race of Space Warriors, Agressive and Violent Man D'Elite, actually doing anything violent. So Vegeta doesn't really kill anyone after he comes to Goku's side. He never really betrays despite his numerous outbursts against Goku and for his own titles and destiny. That would mean consequences. Even with the whole Fusion business with Buu, he fuses. Vegeta, the proudest being in the universe, fuses an eternal fusion that means he will never be himself again and will be stradled with Goku forever. A dire, definite and tremendous choice with consequences that last a WHOLE 10 MINUTES. \
I could cite the entire anime for its insane amount of bullshit to avoid consequences, but I think my point is made.\
Toriyama hates responsibilities. So his characters remain shallow and consequenceless, despite their claims. The fights are consequence-free, since you can just pull a new form or power level out your butt.\
And I wouldn't be so bothered by this crap if it weren't for the origin of it: laziness. DBZ is very very lazy. It's not a creative choice, it's just a man who's naturally lazy and doesn't want to bother with risks or choices or difficult things, so it's all about yelling a lot, power levels and new forms, and never doing anything that would actually mean something and make this anime NOT FUCKING SHIT.\
There.  If you've actually read this rant all the way here, I'm sorry I pissed all over. But I'm not sorry for saying this is very bad and Toriyama is very bad too.\
Oh and there's more to say but those are the really important ones, the rest doesn't matter. I guess the story matters, it keeps getting worse because it's always the same stuff repeated with slight alterations every time, but really that's every nekketsu.\
Overall: 2 : I can't watch it without feeling like I'd need to be 7 to appreciate it at all. By 10 years old I'd drop it. \
This anime is bad, and you should feel bad if you're one of those who enable new animes or mangas to be just as bad.\

    What can I truly say about this show that would capture what Dragon Ball Z is, without any spoilers? Like many others I have watched this show from the Cartoon Network days, not from the very begining but close enough. Since I started watching it I knew there was something special. I've never watched or heard of anime before I watched Dragon Ball Z. At this point anime to me is the purest, most raw form of entertainment there is and Dragon Ball Z is the best there is. I haven't seen every anime out there but I call it the best because I think\
          \
        anyone can transition from it into anime pretty easy. \
Story:\
The story at times can be a little cliche and cheesy. The characters discover a newer, stronger enemy. Then they must over power this enemy some how. When ever they over come an enemy it's usualy very dramatic and not very possible by real life standards. The great thing about the series is there are several twists and turns. Sometimes through time travel, other dimensions, characters being pure evil near the begining becoming good later or newly found fighting power or strenghth. To go along with the story is amazing martial arts action and over the top energy based attacks that sometimes destroy entire planets.\
Art:\
The art is not spectacular but it serves its purpose. You may run into characteres or enviroments that clearly repeat the same animation. When the characters are flying over islands or plains they all look the same. Even some fight sequences have repeatitive animation. If you're looking for an art show, look else where.\
Sound:\
Depending on which dub you watch the music and sound for some is a mixed bag. If you watch the Funimation version of the series the music is a never ending, techno-rock based soundtrack that fits the intense action and drama quite well. There are also different voice actors for different dubs as well. For the purpose of this review I would watch the Funimation dub with the new american soundtrack. The sound effects are very good as well with decent explosion, punch/kick, electricity, and energy sounds to add to the action. As far as the voice acting goes there is some high quality work here. Some of the actors have multiple parts throughout the series but you probably won't notice them. Some of the voices can show what type of struggle these character went throught.  \
Character:\
When you think of your typical heros and villians you expect a constant push and shove relationship. Dragon Ball Z has this in spades. The heros range from your run of the mill human beings with super human powers to your alien races that could kick the hell out of Superman anyday. There is a decent roster of good and bad characters from aliens to androids to demons to animal-like characters. The kicker with each character though is the pain and suffering they go through physically. Whenever the heros are faced with a seemingly invincible villian they end up pulling through in near death situations. Not to mention the resilience of the villians that seem to at times never die. Taking into account the strenghth and power of the characters is truly astonishing. The character development is beyond anything I have ever seen in any anime to date.  Death and the after life play a big part in most of the characters development in which no character ever really dies. \
Enjoyment: \
I feel there is a little something for everyone hear. Enough action to blow Hollywood out of the water. Dry yet wholesome humor that will grow on you by the end of the series. With the combination of the action scenes, an excellent story with plenty of variety, strong heros that really make you feel at ease, and indestructable villians that can be ruthless and psychotic with abilities beyond comprehension. Since anime is the best form of entertainment (my opinion), Dragon Ball Z is the best form of anime.\
Overall:\
Not much else can be said about the greatest series of all time. I would recommend for any fan of anime to check this out if you haven't already. It is and all ways will be my favorite. Hopefully this review has persuaded you in the right direction and you watch Dragon Ball Z as soon as possible.\

    this was the first anime and manga i ever got addicted to or watched i highly recomend it to a fighting maniac plus the characters are very loveable and there is a character for neraly ever kind of personality the is quite a few of twists and turns this is the best out off the 3 (Dragonball,Dragonball Z,Dragonball GT,)\
Story \
The story is basic revolved around the main character Goku a sayian sent to destroy earth (also for a breif time Gokus son Gohan) it is full of interesting twists and alot of amusing characters and events unlike the Dragonball in is not mainly revolved around\
          \
        the world tounments but more to Gokus heratege and aliens from space it will keep u at the end of ur seats note there isent much romance for people how like it no kissing or as such is seen but there is alot of relasionships.\
Art\
The grafics arnt the best at first but as it progress it gets a lot better but the attacks like the kamkamha wave are great.\
Sound \
the sound is great the voices all are unique which give it great effect to the anime itself not to metchin the battle music and attacks are fantastic \
Characters\
my favorite part ther are all unique and are very funny my favorite is Gohan they all have different backgrounds which make the very interesting some are easier to fegure out than others.\
Enjoyment \

    On the start, it's a good anime, the story runs nice and smoothly, and really enjoyable.\
Sadly after Goku turns adult, the story is only between the way some random strong guy comes to earth to conquer or destroy it, and goku and his friends trains to beat them. Makes it not enjoyable anymore - at least for me, since it's turns like a 'Smack Down' battle...\
Not much special and unique things occurs after goku turns adult except new enemies, upgraded skill (yes only upgrade, it's just like : before : you only have a wild run missile, after : you add hovering ability to missile,\
          \
        after that you make it bigger for better firepower. Nothing special)\
The art is Very Good, compared with another anime at those age, so do the sounds. Character development is good on the early episode, but turns so-so and slow in the middle-end.\
Overall, If you wants to watch this series and still have good memories from it, just watch until the end of Tenka Ichi Budokain Tournament.\
If you REALLY loves fighting scene (eventough it's only repeatable frame) you may wants to watch until the end.\

    It seems like you can't say something bad about Dragon Ball Z without fans getting on your ass about it. Well screw the fans. I'll give my honest opinion on the show.\
The Bad. Well the first thing I feel that I have to mention is the length of the fight scenes, they are all horribly long and in my opinion get boring after the first episode that is dedicated to a fight. That's something I really disliked about this series, when it's in a movie it's fine, especially the Bojack movie, because that movie actually served to develop both 3 of the characters in the\
          \
        show. But when you only have 3 characters in the whole of the series that really go through massive character development then you are doing something wrong. Dragon Ball Z is also written like something that doesn't want you to take it seriously but it does want you to take it seriously. It would have been better if it were created as a parody to action series but it really isn't, it pretty much defines the genre which I find very unfortunate as there are a lot of much better action series out there including Black Lagoon and Neon Genesis Evangelion. Both stop to take a look at the characters and plot rather than focusing only on the action. And the soundtrack outside of the opening themes isn't really memorable at all.\
The good. The animation is nice and the fight scenes are fluid in animation. I found myself enjoying them when they weren't going on for literal hours. And the opening themes are good.\
Final Verdict:\
Dragon Ball Z is one of those anime that people really need to put down in favor of other action series. was still good but not perfect by any standard.\

the series creator, Akira Toriyama, had great ideas when he created this fantastic piece of work. By fusing martial arts and ki control, he has created a combination that can be enjoyed by anyone. \

    This is the story of those whose lives were touched, by the dragon balls..\
Let me start out by saying, Dragon Ball Z is great, perhaps one of the greatest animes out there, and it definitely is. Remaining as part of the 'Big 4' as some viewers call it, standing tall next to masterpieces as One Piece, Bleach, and Naruto. Let me tell you why Dragon Ball Z stands the test of time.\
The Dragon Ball series was one of the first anime to influence many of those that are popular today, and whenever anyone mentions it's name, they know what you're talking about. Despite the closely\
          \
        equal line that divides the haters and lovers of the Dragon Ball Z, DBZ does not disappoint those who watch it. Even though the story hops around from time to time, and most of it is just fighting, screaming, and powering up for a few episodes, this series is great in it's fight scenes, they're the type of fights that get your blood boiling from the anticipation, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat from the intensity and speed taking place within that fight. As stated earlier, Dragon Ball Z stands the test of time, and remains in the hearts of adults who have grown up, watching the show every day after school, and the hearts of their children, who have yet to grow up and watch the greatness that their parents once did. \
Now, before you click off of my review saying I haven't really said much to distinguish my review from other reviewer's reviews, do trust in me, and the other reviewers, and go watch it, you'll learn a lot from the lessons it has to teach you about life, it will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time, and it will remain in your heart for the rest of your life. Now, while you head out on your adventures in the world of Dragon Ball, remember to keep your eye out for those wonderful artifacts known as the Dragon Balls, you may just stumble upon all 7 of them.\

    Dragon Ball Z is truly a classic anime and perfect for even those who haven't seen Dragon Ball.  The anime is a classic even among people whom have never seen anime before, and it's a much watch with it's classic battles and storytelling.  I personally enjoyed each character's development throughout the series, hard set characters slowly changing into the characters we have then known to love.  If there's any critique to be given about DBZ, it should be said that battle sequences do get boring after some time, the characters screams for maybe a solid 2-5 minutes before the battle actually starts,\
          \
        and the plotline of each of the three major sagas, Frieza, Cell, and Buu, can seem a little repetitive, but honestly what anime isn't?  The fillers are entertaining and this anime is definitely worth watching for any anime fan.  \

    Most people watched this when they were younger but for myself I watched it when I was around 10. (I'm not that old) Dragon ball z is a really good anime for many things but the story in it is not all that great. Yeah they change it up sometimes but it's a repeat. (7/10)\
The art in dragon ball z at the time was really well done. Small things like how you could tell what was going to be smashed apart like rocks did not ruin this anime at all. (8/10)\

    This is one anime that everyone in the world knows about. For the majority of people, it's their favorite anime. The storyline has five sagas (over 200 eps) and has even two arcs which are just fillers. Also there are 13 movies related to the show alone. DBZ has no repeated stories at all like Pokemon does.\
The story starts where Dragon ball (original show) left off. The first saga informs us about Raditz (Goku's brother) who tells Goku that he is a saiyan (alien race) and he does not belong on earth. As the story goes on, Goku learns about his heritage and makes friends\
          \
        will almost everyone. With every battle his strength increases enabling him to protect the planet he loves dearly.\
The two main characters Goku and Vegeta are just opposite to each other. One is empathetic but the other is egocentric. Yet he also develops affection for everybody in his own way! There are even other main characters like Gohan, Goten, Trunks, Yamcha, Tien, Krillin and many more.\
The fights are intense. Almost all the episodes have fighting scenes in them. The greatest fights are in Frieza Saga, the one between Goku and Frieza which lasts for about 30 episodes, and the one in Trunks Saga which is even better than Frieza Saga. And don't forget the fights in Buu Saga too!\
It's a long series so it just cannot be explained in one review. So I am ending my review here.\
This show is for everybody, the original version is suitable for everyone who is above 13!\

    This is seriously my first time writing a review. I've decided to start with Dragon Ball Z, one of the shows that were so mainstream back then which I admit that I did somehow always anticipate as a child. But let's get over with it. I might be digging my own grave here because of this. But well, here goes:\
Story - 2\
The story doesn't give that much appeal to me as I've realized its simple, very mediocre shounen pattern: Enemy appears out of nowhere, they try to get stronger, fight them, use full force, etc. The story is just too shallow that there's little to\
          \
        no thrill behind it. \
Art - 3\
The art style is really poor for me. The art is just too plain even if you compare it to anime/manga of its time. All main characters are muscular as if their bodies' gonna explode anytime sooner by looking at their veins. The author most likely compensates with the hair in an effort to make it look better which somehow contributed and pleased a lot of audiences\
Sound - 9\
I give the sound effects a score of 9. The sound effects especially during battle is so good and they give intense thrill. This is the strongest thing this anime has to offer\
Character - 3\
Well, character development is just so low. Only Goku, Vegeta, Gohan and the rest of the Saiyan family gets stronger and gets to keep up with their opponents. Others were considered like trashes. As if they have to retire out of the show because they could not keep up with the main characters anymore. And it's like Goku and the rest of the Saiyans are the only ones available to fight simply because \"they're strong\". Other characters are so neglected of their roles that they aren't that much part of the story as it progresses. Also, this show lacks women in the fighting force. \
Enjoyment - 5 \
The fight since sure are enjoyable for common audiences. But somehow, it doesn't please me that much as the fight since are all about using each others' full force to the maximum level they can. Like this character getting angry because he saw his friend got harmed or killed, he'll transform and get stronger then proceed to beat up the villain. However, the thing is that this anime mainly lacks strategy and tactics in defeating the enemy. Always relying on sheer force. Thus, I don't really enjoy this that much\
Overall - 3 \
That's the overall rating I could give this show which I admit is a part of my childhood. But my views about this changed.",

    I seen Dragon Ball Z 3 times already and although i'm a big fan of this anime that doesn't mean I won't talked about the flaws it has. Is my all time favorite because is not like most cliche anime, Dragon ball Z stand on it's own. I'm going to talk about the anime that got me started watching other animes.\
Story- They story keeps changing but is really simple to follow, is the plot is basically Goku and his friend defend earth from evil beings. I Like how there is always a new threat that arrives and Goku and his allies has to find a\
          \
        way to defeat the enemy so earth won't be destroyed.  Most of the time the pacing is really slow like when Goku is about to fight a villian and you have to wait like 10 episode for the fight to actually go down, lol. If you are unpatient this can be a bad thing for you. \
Art- I like old school anime so I though it looked great for its age, so no complaints.\
Sound- Great editing expectially in the fight scenes, very well done.\
Character- They were none cliche characters that you see in a lot of animes, they all looked different and were unique in their own ways. I liked every of the Z fighters even if some of them weren't as strong as Vegita or Goku (like Krillin) they still wanted to fight for their lives and their friends life, you got to respect a character like that. The villians were also great. you knew right away that they were a threat and we the Z fighters had a lot to deal with if they want to defeat them. Great character development that you felt the connection with each of the characters that you also felt worried for them.\
Love the protagonist Goku that never gives up ( Although he is a bit too trusting at times) and my favorite wich is Trunks.\
Enjoyment- Like I said before, I rewatch Dragon Ball Z 3 times and will do it again because is a lot of fun to watch. With great characters, great story that changes with each saga, Dragon Ball Z is not an anime you want to miss. I recommend this anime to all anime fans.\

    I thought that this anime was indeed a masterpiece. not only was it one of the greatest anime of it's time but , it is still being watched and loved by the younger and older generation.\
The story was good, though it was long, nerveless amazing. Whenever you thought that the story was going to end, new enemies showed up and the old ones that you thought were dead reappeared. Everything was connected to each other.It was one of those rare stories and i believe one of the first ones to actually see the characters grow up.\
One of the down sides that i believed was Goku's\
          \
        death rate. In Almost every Saga he died at least once and did not return until the end when it was the final battle. I thought that it was a bit repetitive. Another down side was it took forever for the final battle, i.e. the Freeza Saga, it took about 10 episodes or so just for Goku to finish his Spirit Bomb and to finally throw it. The same goes for the Buu Saga.\
The Characters were good though, supporting or main. There were not any characters that would of been completely annoying in my opinion. \

    It starts with the dragon ball with a bang and ends in DBZ with a BANG! It'll give you the goosebumps. It will make you go crazy, the inner madness in you. Make you feel like you're the strongest one in the universe. Too much awesome anime. Now that I've come to an end... I feel very sad that I won't be able to see any action from this Goku and Vageta. \
The best part of this anime is the humor within the massive heart throbbing action. It will make your blood boil in anger and make you go dancing on you sit.The way the\
          \
        story builds and goes along with the flow is just outstanding. You won't get bored at all. Interesting turn of events  keep coming as the protagonists come with more surprise and breathtaking super powers.\
The best few parts are when in the most dire needs Goku comes flying with his legendary looks. and then the best part where he shows the world he's final form and made us (fans) fall from the sky. \
There is no reason to hate this anime. I give this 10/10 just because of the superbly written story and flow of the story as it made us crave for more.\

    Não dá para comparar Dragon Ball, sinceramente, ele não tem uma grande história, é bem pobre na verdade, considerando que o anime é voltado para crianças, (Meu caso na época que assisti) não é um fator muito importante neste anime, ele compensa seus pontos negativos com cenas de ação, personagens incrivelmente carismáticos e uma trilha sonora muito boa, para a época, a animação é boa, mas não deixa a desejar nas cenas de ação, para você que está na faixa de 10-12 anos, este é o anime perfeito, foi o primeiro anime que assisti, e o que mais marcou minha vida, tenho até uma coleção\
          \
        de DVD'S com todos os episódios, do clássico até o GT, com certeza se você está começando no mundo de animes, este é ideal, não recomendo para alguém que já tenha experiência com tais shonens, pois pode achar clichê ou genérico, para mim, eu comecei e terminei com um sorriso no rosto, aproveitei cada segundo desta obra incrível.\

    Review:\
OHMERGAWD! Dragon Ball Z is clearly my favorite anime of all time! Even non-otakus know of the beautiful Dragon Ball series! Family members had me watch some scenes from the original Dragon Ball when I was about 8. It was hilarious, but I had no idea what Dragon Ball was. I recall being ten and witnessing its come-back on Nicktoons as \"Dragon Ball Z: Kai\" or \"Dragon Ball Kai\". I remember that right after turning on Nicktoons to see its \"return\", I ran up to tell my wayyyyy older siblings. I learned more about this anime than any other, and I pretty much know most\
          \
        of the lines by heart. I've been a girl who is typically into action Shonen, so this was a big treat to me. Falling in love with some of male characters over and over again, and witnessing the unique-ness of this anime. Mainly boys watch this anime, but it was my first anime, and therefore it became, well...my idol I guess you could say. I got hooked and it inspired me to start drawing manga and anime. As I got older and finished the anime, I became interested in similar anime (Naruto, One Piece, Bleach,  Yu Yu Hakusho, etc.). Nowadays, I have gymnastics all the time, but I manage to find a fair amount of time to watch anime, and even rewatch DBZ for the millionth time. I am working on the first series, Dragon Ball, and I must say that it too has been a treat.\
Quick Summary:\
Goku and his friends protect the earth they love from different villains seeking the magical orbs that grant any one wish, the Dragon Balls.\
Conclusion:\
A must-watch. Beautifully animated and even greatly dubbed! Have fun! :) (As you can see I am a big fangirl of this).\

    you know... i used to like this show as a child up until i turned 20, when  a friend of mine angered by my personal bias forced me to re watch ONE  of my favorite Episodes of DBZ, which is  where i saw the light. \
As a former DBZ fan i'd like to say that this show is very deceiving,  for some people growing up as a kid (i am one of them)  as long as there were \"hype\" fight scenes and power ups it was considered a great anime but when your a young adult you have do the\
          \
        painstaking task of seeing past your personal biases and break  down what you are watching. re watching a bit of DBZ i have come to realize that this show's plot simply consists of  antagonists who want to destroy the world (cause their evil) protagonists shooting beams at antagonists with a clash lasting for 3 episodes coupled with the power ups lasting equally as long  and the bleak characters and their appalling character development.\
In my opinion the only decent arc in this series was the majin buu arc, the villain   was memorable and  i could stomach some of the fight scenes and needless screams. \

    It's not perfect, I know it. But Dragon Ball Z must be seen as a pioneer which has influenced most of the nekettsu and shonen works. It has some flaws, but it has given so much to the manga industry.\
Still, Dragon Ball Z is a great anime. The story is rather good, the characters are enjoyable and charismatic. But its greatest quality is to be so much enjoyable. It gives you feels, and it never stops impressing you.\
Moreover, it hasn't got really big flaws, and even works inspired by it are worse (Bleach, Naruto and Fairy Tail are sadly well-known examples).\
In brief, Dragon Ball Z\
          \
        is a masterpiece, a monument. It does truly have a legacy.\

    I am so completely and utterly biased towards this anime that I can't even be sure that I'm fairly rating it. I have re-watched the episodes so often and so frequently that I have memorized the dialogue. This anime defined my childhood, like it did to many other people raised in the 90s and the early 2000s, and to this day I can't help but get giddy whenever I hear the opening song or re-watch the episodes. I have come to slowly understand over the years that just because DBZ is my favorite anime it doesn't mean that it is anywhere near perfect. I love\
          \
        this show with all my heart but looking at it objectively I have to point out the mistakes that ruin this series. \
Story: The story only gets more interesting as the show progresses, gradually becoming better and better every arc. The peak of the series is the android/cell arc which, according to me anyway, is the best part of the series. This is also the point where the series should have ended in my eyes and where I always stop when I finish another marathon. The part that will turn many people away from this series is the extremely long and tedious filler arcs and the terrible pacing. DBZ is renowned for its heavy reliance on filler, used even during crucial fights to drag it out. The most infamous example being the goku vs. frieza fight.\
Art: For its time the art really is some of the best. It may not hold up to the art from this generation that is very fluid and pretty but honestly this show wouldn't be the same without this art style and the fight scenes wouldn't be nearly as fun. \
Sound: Well, now that I am older and, while I do love the dub very much, the voice acting isn't exactly the best. There are moments where the speech sounds odd and there are many lines that were ad-libbed. None of this detracted from my enjoyment as a kid or even now but it could turn away new fans so if you really can't stand the acting I would recommend watching the DBZkai version or watching the original japanese version(goku's voice takes some getting used to but once you get passed that its fantastic). The soundtrack is amazing for all of the versions so it really is up to whatever your preference may be.\
Character: Other than the saiyans and piccolo on occasion, the other characters get left behind in terms of power and character development. In dragonball we were introduced to all of these amazing characters that were strong, rivaling goku throughout the series, that had all of these fantastic quirks to them. In DBZ they were tossed into the background without a second thought. While there are a lot of defining moments, rarely any of them are for the human members of the Z warrior gang which is very unfortunate. \
Enjoyment: I have never enjoyed a show more. Probably because of all of the nostalgia but it really did have a huge impact in my childhood.\
TL;DR DBZ is just fun to watch. The action scenes are amazing, and really, that is what made DBZ the legend it is today. It has terrible pacing, the plot gets repetitive after a while and there are so many plot holes that it stops making sense after a while. I can't say that everyone will like it because I know plenty of people who don't. This show is for people who love to watch super powered action scenes for fun. If you're looking for more than a fun ride with this series than I am sorry to disappoint.\

    I'm not gonna spend much time or effort on this review cause DBZ already took more of my life than it deserves so I'll get straight to the point.\
IT'S TO DAMN LONG! And not in a good way, the manga is 520 chapters long and it's not Monster, or Death Note, or Ashita no Joe, or Steins;Gate or countless other adaptations with rather wordy source material. It's an action manga, it zooms by, there are lots of fights and explosions with usually at most brief interruptions for dialogue and exposition. With all that you'd think the anime would have some decent action too, NOPE! Not\
          \
        only is it terribly paced and adapts maybe like a chapter per episode if not less but it also completely ruins the fights cause most of the time the animation is super cheap, it's very slow and often interrupted by spectators providing useless commentary to pad out the episodes. \
And I know, anime should be judged on its own merit but if I did that my problem would remain the same. The pacing is dreadful and the everything progresses so slowly that I can't even focus on the show and think how much closer to the grave I am while spending countless hours on some of the least entertaining anime I've had the displeasure of watching in a very long while.\
Even though the art is pretty solid the animation is anything but, even some of the most important fights don't get much love and even when they do it's rarely something impressive.\
Now you can tell me how it's a weekly series and they had to keep them coming while manga was still ongoing and there's not much money but tell me, do the production problem make this any more fun? To me the answer is no they don't, it's still a dreadful anime.\

    The Series that started it all for me is a similar story to my favourite Series First of the North Star where instead of giving it a 10 I have given it a 9 because once again, I cannot ignore the “faults” others may find in it such as the infamous plotholes. Of course I can’t defend the “faults” though I do have my own reasons or excuses if you will, for ignoring these “faults” which I won’t get into now.\
While the franchise is still alive and kicking, this Series specifically is a great trip down Memory Lane stretching all the way back to when\
          \
        I was a child in the UK watching this on Toonami in Ocean Dub, which also gets a lot of criticisms for some nonsensical reason. Critics aside, no one can argue that some of the greatest and memorable moments in Action Anime History with the most beloved characters in Anime History are all in this very series and thus making the Franchise a Pillar to younger generations of Mainstream Anime.\
For a lot of people including myself this is probably responsible for many even knowing what Anime is in the first place, for me personally I don’t know whether I should be grateful for that or angry because I had to suffer through so many years of Anime.  I might get heat for once again making my review about nostalgia but it’s just a cartoon, no need to overanalyse it so instead I’m gonna recommend people around my age or older to just grow up and stop watching Anime whilst recommending this series to the much younger viewers out there. Just put yourself in my shoes where I would watch marathons of this Series in the Summer of 2003 thus creating a VHS collection which are now lost and then try telling me that this isn't one of the Best cartoons ever!

\"Well I think she just humed a few tunes\" - Vegeta\
Dragon Ball Z is the definition of an overrated shounen anime, with something like Naruto close behind. 80% of people who like this series because of this wonderful thing called nostalgia which can sometimes be a bitch for people like me because people will instantly give my review a not helpful because I’m doing a disservice to their childhood memories of sitting in their living room watching Dragon Ball Z!\
Also, I'm not saying I hate Dragon Ball Z, their video games were really enjoyable\
          \
        and a memorable part of my childhood, I'm just saying don't blindly act like it's the best thing ever created because it really isn't.\
Read the review or don't rate my review, those are you two choices, so be an honest person.\
Story – 5\
One problem with Dragon Ball Z’s story is that every single arc is the same as the last one other than the previous enemies are replaced with slightly altered clones of the last arc. I want to bring to your attention that literally every primary Villain in the Dragon Ball Z, such as Vegeta, Frieza, Cell and Buu all have one or more transformations and all of these transformations come with a large power up that is usually bullshit and serves just to make the runtime of this already boring show longer. Also almost every Villain has the same goal, to enslave the world or destroy it, I know they’ve got really diverse goals.\
Another problem with Dragon Ball Z’s story is that the episodes are just too long and most of the time hardly anything important happens. I’ve literally seen some episodes where Goku/Gohan punches someone and then talks or thinks the rest of the episode, and this wouldn’t be so bad is that talking or thinking was somewhat productive to this battle but they aren’t its usually just boring bullshit like “I punched that guy, and now I’ll punch him again next episode”.\
So why do most people believe the story to be somewhat enjoyable? Because you watched this show when you were 4-10, anything you watched at that age with explosions would have seemed like the best thing ever. When you’re a child you just don’t really have the ability to tell a good show from a bad show, when I was a kid I could swear that Power Rangers was the best show ever created and not only was the acting superb but the storyline as well.\
Art – 8\
People who have seen Shingeki no Kyojin might question me giving this an 8 for art, but for things like Art and Sound you must always take into consideration when this anime was created. Now for the late 80s and early to mid 90s the animation was really top notch, other than things like well funded animated movies back then not much could surpass the art and animation in Dragon Ball Z, the character designs were rather refreshing and kind of set a trend for shounen characters that came after this show.\
Sound – 9\
Now something Dragon Ball Z does really well is the sound, not only is the music good but the voice acting is really on point excluding Goku’s voice in the Japanese version because that is just a little unsettling. Have you heard really old English Dubbed like Mobile Suit Gundam, the voice acting is awful. This is actually something depressing about current anime because English Dubbed usually suck now.\
\
Characters – 7\
Oh, I’m sorry did I burst the bubble you were hiding inside? Oh I have noticed that Goku is on your favorite character list, but guess what? I don’t really care and yes, I’m saying you do have bad taste in characters!\
Now first the major plot point in Dragon Ball Z that just ruins the characters in that death isn’t even a problem. Now I’m exaggerating when I don’t call it a problem but a lot of characters don’t stay dead. In all of the Dragon Ball series, not just Z the character Krillin and this is a minor spoiler dies four times and he still comes back to life. Characters can come back to life because when you collect the Dragon Ball Z you can just revive characters, and though there are some restrictions to how many times it seems like they do it all the time. Also Heaven happens to have a battle arena, go figure.\
Some characters in Dragon Ball Z do have somewhat interesting personalities specifically the side characters such as Yamacha, Mr. Satan, and Mr. Popo. \
“Vegeta what does the scanner say about his power level? ‘It’s over 9000 (crushes scanner)’ What 9000?!” – Nappa and Vegeta\
What the fuck is a power level and is 9000 really an enormous amount? No, power levels are unimportant and incomparable because at any time the main character or enemy will just use that super secret power up he only uses in a sticky situation to become infinitely more powerful.\
Enjoyment – 5\
Another problem with Dragon Ball Z is that that is that the extremely slow pace can make it a very hard watch, it’s such a long show and really in the grand scheme of things not much happens other than characters standing around talking or characters having a battle that takes longer than the seven years war. I dare to you try and rewatch this anime  series without skipping anything and tell me your opinion hasn’t changed about it because you’ll realize all the flaws this series has and how a lot of It just isn’t that enjoyable.\
Overall – 6.8\
There are two anime series that many American non-anime watchers have come to like one being Dragon Ball Z and the other one being Avatar: The Last Airbender and that isn’t really an anime because it was made by Americans in America. Why do these non-anime watchers like Dragon Ball Z and not other series? One because they’re very stubborn and refuse to watch something foreign or something that has subtitles because reading is too hard for them and the second reason is because Dragon Ball Z was aired when a lot of people from age 14-21 were children or preteens and it was entertaining for a time when shows like “Ed, Edd n Eddy” were all the rage and our Saturday nights were usually spent in front of the T.V instead of the computer or cell phone. If you haven’t seen Dragon Ball Z then you probably will never like it because the nostalgia factor is the real reason so many people like it.\
It’s not bad but I don’t really recommend it, there are so many other series out there that are much more enjoyable and I recommend series like Hunter x Hunter (2011), Shingeki no Kyojin, The Flower We Saw That Day, Clannad, Fairy Tail and Angel Beats.\
Also I wish I could produce a massive beam of energy from my hands while screaming Kamehameha, but that's just not realistic. ",

    Oh Dragon Ball Z, how you bring back so many fond memories of my childhood. Anyway, let's begin.\
Story - Even to this day, I can still remember the story and sagas very throughly. It is one that sticks with you. The story of Dragon Ball Z takes place on Earth and a Saiyan named Goku and the perilous adventures that he and his friends and family must endure to ensure the safety of planet Earth. \
Art - Very crisp, sharp quality for its time. Still one of the better looking animes for the 1989-1996 timeline. \
Sound - You will hear lots of screaming, explosions and\
          \
        witty and sometimes funny comments or remarks. The dialogue is great, the voice actors are amazing. Even to this day Sean Schemmel (Goku) and Christopher Sabat (Vegeta, Piccolo) are still hot in demand. Overall in the sound department. Great opening and ending songs. No complaints from me.    \
Character - The characters in Dragon Ball Z are really special. You feel a deep connection with them. There are many characters as well. I'll list a few: Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Gohan, Krillin, Tien, Yamcha, Trunks, Goten...and many more. The bond between Vegeta and Goku starts off as a strong and bitter rivalry, but then later on develops into a friendship.\
Enjoyement - For me to still remember pretty much the entire storyline of Dragon Ball Z even to this day is saying something. I enjoyed every moment of it. While some may differ with the whole 'it takes three or more episodes just to power up' aspect of it, I didn't really mind it. It doesn't ruin the show or anything like that. \
Overall - Dragon Ball Z will always hold a special place to me. Still one of my most cherished/beloved animes. Perfect 10/10 from me ^_^\

    Grown up watching this epic anime. Dragon Ball at first seem a cut-throat battle of the warriors from cosmos working desperately on their martial arts skills to prove their superiority. But deep in it, lies some of the most important lessons you can learn as a human. Main character Goku faces warriors like Raditz, Vegeta, Freeza, Cell, Buu etc. You can easily see the increasing ability of these opponents. Each time he faces an opponent stronger than any of his previous opponents. He doesn't get intimidated by this. Instead his incredible enthusiasm to fight with the best and pushing his limits in order to match\
          \
        the powerful opponent is remarkable.\
And his top-notch skills doesn't make him arrogant and keep him reachable to his friends and family.\
Vegeta couldn't get the fact that Goku despite being a low-class saiyan warrior, how could he surpass him. It teaches that no matter how much potential you have, you need to work hard to become the best. There are no such a thing like \"low-class\" or \"high-class\" warrior but just a strong will to work hard to become the best. It applies to humans like us too.\
Vegeta at first seems a proud vain prince of the saiyans. His transformation from one of the ruthless villains to one of the heroes is extraordinary. But, what I admire most of him is one of his quality. He never give up on losing competition from his Kakarot. He thinks that he is the prince of the saiyans and getting the Super Saiyan status was his Birth-Right. But Goku surpassing him on every moment doesn't discourage him. Instead he has a strong will to surpass Kakarot one day to prove himself the strongest saiyan warrior. This teaches us as humans that no matterhow strong our competition is, we should work on our strengths to improve ourselves. Competition is healthy if it improves one's abilities. This quote by him portrays his strong will :-\
\"Fine, Kakarot, you are the mightiest Saiyan, I've admitted that much. At least for now. But don't you dare think that this is over. I won't let you keep me in second place forever, feeding on the scraps of your glory. I will surpass you, and even then I'll keep pushing, I'll surpass every single warrior in the Universe. I won't stop until I'm the ultimate number one. \"\
This shows the top-class competition to reach the top and respect for friendship. I wish I could have learn these qualities from Goku and Vegeta. Dragon Ball is simply one of the most motivational anime for me. \

    First, i like this anime, but favouritism\
and opinion are different things.\
Many people say that this anime is the best anime of all time, but he's not.\
 The story are so poor and only serves to supporting the battles, she not have any drama or emotion, only comedy, it's  repetitive and the characters return to life so many times, they seems zombies.\
 The sound is nothing  more than normal.\
 The characters evolve only your powers, and many of them participate of the story as extras, but some are charismatic.\
 I will not say nothing about the art, because it was the resources of the\
          \
        year.\
To complete, this anime is focused in battles without any strategy, and your unique highlight it's your action and the fact that it inspired many mangá like Naruto.\

Sorry but it does not match anything I have seen in anime.\
Apparently there are many who do not want to see anything that might put down anything Dragon Ball related.  Sorry, other opinions do exist and will continue to\
Poorly drawn or a sloppy style compared to other Anime out there.\
The DBZ series is one of the few Anime Series that makes me try and deny its Anime or if pushed will then deny I am into Anime if that is people's definition.\
This is the Hanna Barbera of Japan.\
Accept the fact I do not like it and\
          \
        move on.\
Every single character looks like they eat and drink steroids.  Everything's is a power play.  \
I would say if they refined their character style to bring out more of their individuality it might be better.  The plots are also very simplistic, they have very little character development as compared to other anime series I have seen.\
I stand by my review and comparison.\

    Dragon Ball Z is like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. You played it as kid, and loved it, best game ever. However, the kids of today will look at it and think, \"How was this ever popular?\" And the adults of yesterday, those that can look at this objectively, putting past all their love for this will say a very similar thing.\
Dragon Ball Z stumbles through 291 episodes to deliver you an anime that by today's standards would be greatly hated on. With ridiculously overused animations, like my favourite knee into elbow combo. Sounds are also greatly overused, such as the whooshing and\
          \
        teleport noises.\
Dragon Ball Z's ultimate weakness, was its ridiculous characters and plot devices. Death is completely meaningless thanks to the Dragon Balls, which grant any wish. \
Any fan of Doctor Who will know that one Dalek is a threat, while an army is a nuisance. The reason for this is, that an army of Dalek is so strong, the consequences of not defeating them are so great, that they must be defeated. I believe no other show can be compared to this quite like Dragon Ball Z. \
Characters eventually become so strong that gods are involved. \
The biggest problem with this is that the consequences of losing become so great, that there might as well be none. This is due to the fact that, when dealing with characters that can blow up planets, and eventually universes, your protagonists MUST defeat them, otherwise you can't continue the series, because the villain destroys the universe.\
Time travel is also forced in there, fusions too and the whole 'powering up' and forms stuff. \
The art and character designs as a whole still hold up well, not great, but they're passable.\
However, my biggest criticism of this whole anime, is the criminal amount of filler. If we use Dragon Ball  Kai as our judgement of what is and isn't filler, it drops our episode count from 291, to 97. That is horrific.\
Overall, Dragon Ball Z is an anime that you had to watch at the time, or be a first timer to the entirety of anime, to enjoy. It has had a 'remake' of sorts, which aimed to patch up many of DBZ's mistakes, but instead served as another thing I can criticize about the show. So I come back to my first comparison, DBZ is like Ocarina of Time, both were masterpieces of their time, but have aged atrociously. Both received remakes which create even more hate for the originals, and show off the sheer amount of carelessness in both original works. Yet, people still hold onto their belief that DBZ is good, just like people hold onto their belief that the original Ocarina of Time is good.\

    Weather you love it or hate it for how DB became towards the end of Z and as convoluted the scaling and logic are in Super, its importance to the history of battle anime is objective. I enjoyed the anime and the manga but since I read the manga and watched the anime at the same time, both in English I came to hate certain changes to plot and characters that the dub made when the English manga kept them the same. I know what most people consider the most important thing for dubs is voice quality but translation quality and smooth localization is more\
          \
        important IMO. either way it is legend and classic that is a great gateway to anime for newcomers or for experienced watches that never watched the classics. I can't recommend it enough if you haven't seen it. Its no masterpiece but is iconic and is one of the most culturally influential titles to come out of Japan since anime became a real part of international nerd culture along with Jojo, which Finally got a proper anime adaptation a few years back.  My final remark is I have a lot of factors for why I love DB so much, a lot of which is a because when I roleplayed it on the playground as a kid it helped calm the god complex I had in my early years (until I was twelve. I was forever alone. Now I'm forever in the friend zone) I enjoy the mythos of DB and how Originally, Goku didn't save the day for the sake of justice but did everything either on a sudden whim or just for shits and or giggles.\

    Let me start off by saying, for everyone that didn't grow up watching this and you want to know what the hype is... this will be the worst anime you will ever watch, period. \
The first Dragonball from what I remember as a child was amazing, there was a point to the story and it flowed pretty well. When Dragonball Z came out, it was a whole new level of crazy and amazement. Yeah it sucks now as an adult because what the hell am I watching, and why is it so repetitive, but as a child it was one of the most entertaining, greatest\
          \
        things that ever happened. \
I really really don't want to recommend this to anyone, unless you want your child to watch it then by all means, go for it. Other wise, look for something better.\

Ah Dragonball Z, another show that drags on forever, and ever. Using the same story lines over and over again, hell even using ones from the first Dragonball. Plus they drag on fights and stories for what seems like a few dozen episodes before they move on. The worst part of the show is Goku, Gohan and the rest of the family, what a waste of characters. I wish they would die.\
Now for what I liked, the battles were great if you can get by the endless dragging them on forever. Piccolo and Vegeta are\

    Dragon Ball Z What can I say This was the first anime I ever Watched and is what got me into anime. I love it and I don't there will ever be another show or anime that i will like better in the future.\
Story: 9/10\
The Story of Dragon Ball Z from start to finish is an engaging action packed thriller following the adventures of Son Goku his son Gohan and his Comrades the Z fighters. The Story arcs in DBZ I found were not in the least bit boring and always left me wanting more.\
Art: 10/10\
Even today the Art of DBZ would be considered good\
          \
        but back in its time it was considered amazing. It never failed to deliver great fight scenes with some still being some of the best fights in anime history.Another thing is that DBZ animation has improved tremendously as time has gone on and progressed\
Sound: 10/10\
Ah the nostalgic sounds of super saiyan ki and two fighters trading blows in the air are nothing but awesome They Still give me a real sense of destruction and mayhem when i hear the sounds of DBZ.\
Character: 10/10  \
DBZ has a few strong examples of character development and they are really something to behold. The examples I'm talking about are Vegeta and Gohan. Vegeta goes from a ruthless murderer killing everyone who opposes in some cases even his allies to a peaceful husband and father of two. Gohan goes from a frighten little child who couldn't even attack his enemies at one point because of fear to a strong confident young who is almost every bit as strong as his father Goku. \
Enjoyment 10/10\
I have Enjoyed DBZ ever since I was in grade 1 and I still enjoy it just as much 13 years later. Not much else to say.\
Overall 10/10 \
What can I say DBZ is and always will be my favourite anime and I dont think the will be anything that will change that. Overall i thinks its a true masterpiece and it should never be forgotten.\
Thank for taking the time to read my review. :)\

    Ah, Dragon Ball Z, one of the most famous, known and loved action/fighting anime in history. I remember how entertaining and emotional this show was when I used to watch it as a kid, every day, glued to the screen, extremely hyped for what would've happened in the  next episode. Watching the epic fights, enemies and trips that Son Goku, that kid  we watched on a journey in the original series, went through in his adulthood. This show is simply awesome overall: The epic transformations, the amazing soundtracks, the muscles, the screams!...\
If I  had to point out a pair of bad things,\
          \
        is definitely the fact that the plot is not one the strong points of the show and that some scenes get reused in the same fight. Plus, the plot development and the overall pace are quite slow. There is a lot of unnecessary talking and staring, and some shots where basically nothing happens for minutes, but these detalis can easily be overlooked and won't take anything off the amazing feelings that this great anime has. Well, this is all. I hope I did well for my first review on this website\

    Dragonball Z, a less funny sequel of Dragon Ball:\
This show has an outstanding story, great music (especially the Japanese version) and a lot of (a bit too much!) action. Like Dragon Ball, the art the art is decent, but outdated-though an improvement on Dragon Ball.\
Dragon Ball blended humour and action, sadly, this didn't. Dragon Ball Z is more about action than anything else. And for me, the humour was one of the best things about Dragon Ball!\
Overall, this is less of comedy, and more of an action. This is for action anime lovers. See it on a different level to Dragon Ball. The best Dragon\

    Overview:\
Dragon Ball Z is probably the most famous anime ever made. How famous is it? People that are hardly otaku still watched this show growing up and loved it. Rafael Nadal has admitted to owning the DVD box set! If you haven't seen DBZ, you have at least heard of it. Hell, even my ex-girlfriend had heard of DBZ and she had never heard of the Wizard of Oz! Although DBZ absolutely revolutionized Shonen anime and is considered the definitive Shonen series, it still had its share of flaws. It wasn't exactly a perfect adaptation of Toriyama's manga as I will explain in a moment.\
          \
        Now lets look at the most famous popular anime of all time!\
Story: 8/10\
The story of Dragonball largely parodied Chinese mythology along with the famous Chinese novel Journey to the West. In terms of story it was a sort of action/comedy  retelling of fairy tales that were familiar to an East Asian audience in the way that Shrek parodied fairy tales that Americans were familiar with. The character of Son Goku is based on the Monkey King Sun Wukong in Journey to the West. A brief example: Goku's staff and magic cloud Kinto-un (flying nimbus in the English dub), were also used by Sun Wukong in the original novel. DBZ on the other hand, which began after volume 17 of the original manga, largely parodies and homages Western science fiction including Superman, the Terminator, and several others. Goku and his friends must fight in epic battles against increasingly strong opponents with increasingly higher stakes at risk. Eventually Goku must battle a powerful demon called Buu that has the power to threaten all life in the universe. The epic scale of DBZ's battles make it truly fun to watch. I rushed home every day from school to watch the next DBZ episode. My mom tutored downstairs, so my brother and I had to watch upstairs. Even if the AC was broken and it was 110 degrees upstairs, FUCK IT! DBZ was on, so we were gonna watch it no matter what! That was the level of devotion that kids growing up in the 90s had for this show! Unfortunately, the anime had to create a LOT of filler in order for the manga to stay ahead. Characters would power up for minutes on end, minor dialogue would be exchanged about how strong character \"A\" is, back to still shot of another character powering up. In the Freeza Saga, this took up entire episodes. A common joke in the 90s was \"How many DBZ characters does it take to screw in a lightbulb?\" The answer: 1, but it will take 20 episodes! \
Characters: 8/10\
The characters in DBZ were quite good and rather memorable. Goku may be seen as a generic shonen hero today, but that is largely because he served as the basis for most shonen heroes to follow. Vegeta was an amusing anti-hero and although he would whine perpetually about how unfair it is that he isn't the strongest, we still thought he was cool anyway. Krillin was a good comic relief character, although that role later was transferred to Goten and Trunks. Some fans of the original Dragon Ball were disappointed that many characters that were big roles in the original like Yamcha, Tien, and Lunch were not important in DBZ. Like most people outside Japan and Hong Kong, I had never seen Dragon Ball when I first saw DBZ so it wasn't really an issue for me. The only real complaint I have with the characters is that the villains grew increasingly simplistic and lame as the series went on. Freeza was actually a decently written and truly despicable villain, but all the ones after him/her/it were rather weak in character development. Cell simply wanted to become the strongest being and later to destroy all that he could, and Buu was a brainless killing machine that simply wrecked shit. Well Evil Buu anyways, Fat Buu was admittedly pretty funny. Overall, these may not be the psychologically deepest or most brilliant characters ever created, but they were fun and fit with tone of the series very well.\
Sound: 9/10\
The openings were AWESOME, the battle music was awesome, this was a phenomenal soundtrack. I'm talking about the Japanese soundtrack by the way, the US soundtrack was ok, but not nearly as good.\
Art: 3/10\
Animation: definion - The process of creating movement. To call DBZ an animation is kind of insulting to other animations. Almost all of DBZ was still shots and using the same key frames over and over again. The only movement during a power up will be something like a characters cape flapping, which consists of 2 frames of animation rapidly going back and forth.\
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uldSCaNDGD0 \
Here is a typical DBZ scene. Notice how little anything ever moves and marvel at the absolute laziness of the animators. Now watch any Disney movie EVER made, and you will see just how cheaply and lazily DBZ was made.\
Enjoyment: 4/10\
The filler really takes a lot out of the enjoyment for me. Some anime that I watched as a kid I can watch again as a 26 year old medical student and still enjoy. Shows like Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Rurouni Kenshin. DBZ on the other hand is a lot harder for me to enjoy. I have no problem with the manga, but the anime I can't really sit through. It takes so long for anything to actually happen! I don't have that kind of time anymore in my life! \"This planet will explode in 5 minutes\" - Freeza...about 20 episodes before Namek explodes.\
Overall: 6/10\
DBZ has some elements that it does amazingly well like creating quirky comedy, fun characters, and battles on an absolutely EPIC scale. It also features some of the most tedious filler ever created and horrendously cheap animation. It is certainly a classic and a Shonen masterpiece, but it is a flawed masterpiece.\

I must say the story is really unique & great. Whenever the episode ends you always get hyped to watch the next one. Until this whole anime ends. I enjoyed every saga which were really interesting. \

    DBZ in a word: MaiHeart\
Unlike most people. DBZ was not part of my childhood. I didn't start watching it until I was practically an adult, now it's basically my life. I love DBZ. It's the anime that got me into anime.\
Vegeta is bae.\
Yes, there's a lot of episodes. Yes, the animation is old. Yes, there's that one annoying \"Over 9000!\" meme on every Facebook wall. But DBZ is a classic of all classics. No anime can compare. It is its very own thing and it has been popular since 1996! That's 20 years brah. \
If you \"like\" anime then you must watch DBZ. \

I don't care! Watch DBZ Kai!\

You've watch other things filled with fighting! Don't give me crap excuses!\
Whiny kid voice: \"Hmm. I'd rather watch Bleach or Naruto\"\
*I stab the Whiny kid voice*\
Seriously though, it's more than just an action filled anime. It teaches you the importance of always striving to become a better person on your own. Sure other people can and will help you along the way, but only you can determine how much of a better individual you are going to become. And the best part is there is no limit. \

    Dragon Ball Z is just the max in terms of action and fighting. Epic battles, that take a long road, until the bad guy is finally beaten (with tons of style and emotion), including a good amount of funny moments as well, DBZ is THE recommendation of an anime everyone should see.\
But it isn't all about fighting. Family, friendship, love, hope and self-confidence are represented very well and some important lessons can be learned all the way it goes, like strength is given to those who have something to protect.\
A stronger enemy after another, every saga has its major antagonist, that, after intense, breath-taking fights,\
          \
        are defeated in an amazing climax. Even those who die fighting for restoring the peace, rest with a smile and prove that heroes are who they are, sacrificing their lives for the greater good of everyone.\
Goku can be seen as an fantastic example through the entire story, as the one who fights not only to protect, but to overcome himself over and over, until he becomes the best, and that is the greatest lesson we take from this incredible masterpiece.\
As the first Dragon Ball, it took an important role when I was just a kid and watching it again was surely worthy of my time! One of the best experiences you might have, so don't miss it!\

I'm not going to tell you that their is a amzing plot, or that the characters under go an amazing change. The plot can be written by a three year old, and the most change anyone goes through is getting a hair cut. The one, and only, thing great about this show was the action and action alone.\

    I won't write a traditional review of DBZ, because I feel that since it defines a large genre of anime it's kinda hard to compare it to what it helped create.\
Started as a comedic take on Journey to the West (see Saiyuki) it quickly grew into a martial arts anime and grew into something bigger.  From the humble beginnings of Goku, a young child with exceptional strength and a tail,  and his quest to find dragonballs (wish granting orbs); all the way to the Buu Saga where the characters have god-like strength and abilities.\
The consistent themes are that Goku triumphs through hard-work, quick\
          \
        thinking (though hardly book smarts), and a sheer love of competition.\
This is the one constant in a series where bad guys become good guys regularly and even their height changes (Vegeta's height changes 5 times in one episode in the Frieza saga).\
Now if you have never seen this series, keep in mind a few things.  The three Dragonball series spanned almost 450 episodes.  As mentioned before, what started out as a joke evolved into a titanic struggle for the fate of the universe.  So things like the talking animals are a hold over from the original beginnings, and become increasingly rare as things continue and the mood becomes more and more serious.  \
Also keep in mind, that there are great action scenes, with a lot of discussion mixed in.  A typical episode starts with a short fight, a 5 minute exposition on how powerful character 'x' has gotten and how it shouldn't be possible, then a lot of bluster and boasting from character 'y', then the episode ends with character 'x' charging up some insane attack that involves a lot of screaming.\
This series has humor and a light-hearted nature in many places, and it can seem odd for them to cut to a humorous moment on Earth in the middle of an exploding planet.\
It sounds like I'm being critical, but it's a unique storytelling that wouldn't work for any other anime.  The closest I have seen is Naruto, and the similarities are completely intentional.\
I recommend watching the US dub for first time watchers.  A. the Japanese soundtrack is godawful and painful to the ears, and B. you can't take this show too seriously and Funimation seems to understand that.\
Some final thoughts, this program is a trendsetter.  So based on what came after it might seem primitive.  Just as a long-time fantasy reader, stumbling across Lord of the Rings for the first time, won't find anything fascinating.  This series stands alone though, in having set the gold standard in every fighting anime created since.",

    This sequel to the dragon ball series somehow managed to be worst than the first. The pacing of this anime is awful. Goku is still the stupid looking, boring, dull character as before. All this anime offers is shouting, screaming, punching, crying, running, dodging, and more shouting. Goku's wife, chi-chi is annoying. She is demanding, lazy, obsessed over her son, mean, and ugly. After watching 15 episodes of this poop I dropped it.

    Ahhh, DBZ, a masterpiece of an anime! I still get so much nostalgia when I watch it. I'm going to try to keep this brief, since it isn't the deepest show or anything. Also it will be spoiler free. This was also my first BIG anime. I didn't think any anime was better. I was wrong. But that doesn't mean that I don't still love it. It will always be close to my heart. It is a masterpiece, after all!\
Story: 7\
This is the weakest aspect of the anime, in my opinion. The story is good, sharing roots with Superman's origin story. I'm also including the\
          \
        length of the show into this category, and it is very long. I'll go ahead and say that I haven't seen EVERY episode, but I've seen all of the major and a lot of the minor fights, and I know enough of the story to get by, obviously. Part of the problem is, deaths don't really mean anything in this show, unless it's a villain. And even then... It still doesn't mean much. Villains have a way of coming back from the dead. If a protagonist dies, they can just get wished back with the Dragon Balls. On top of all of that, there are some plot holes, confusing moments, and continuity errors, which definitely take away from the show. But it mostly has to do with the fact that it's so long. There are a lot of complicated and unnecessary transformations, too, which is also confusing.\
Art: 8\
The art style is nice. It has pretty colors and is nice to look at, but it isn't anything groundbreaking. The other problem is that a lot of things are looped, for example you will notice that stones flying past characters' faces are just the same stones in the same spot over and over, with the same wind effect. Smoke and dust are also too perfect. They are symmetrical. So it's a bit annoying, but it's not THAT big of a deal. This also probably has to do with the length of the show.\
Sound: 10\
The soundtrack is amazing, if you are looking at the dub. Bruce Faulconer did an unbelievable job with this. Also both the subs and dubs are awesome. But the Ocean Dub is hilariously bad. So don't watch that one.\
Character: 10\
DBZ is riddled with so many lovable characters that all the fans love. They are extremely powerful, too. The villains are also awesome. There will be some very sad moments that will make you want to cry, too. A lot of characters are exceptionally funny, too. Also, important note: The Dragon Ball Franchise has so many INCREDIBLE characters, that it's one of the few anime that I find almost impossible to pick a favorite character. Seriously, all characters are pretty much on par with each other, which I think is really neat.\
Enjoyment: 10\
Definitely the strongest aspect of this show. The epic fights, music, and the struggles of our favorite characters is what captivates our attention. It isn't the story. Fans can just ignore all of the things that don't really make too much sense, or are hard to understand or anything. They can just sit back and watch DBZ and have a blast. It's just something that you watch. Not something that you try to pick apart all of the psychological elements or anything.\
Overall: 9.9\
Originally, I had this and Super as a 9 on MAL. I change my mind. It gets a 10, even though there's quite a bit of problems with it! Firstly, it's really damn long! XD And the mistakes that ARE made in DBZ, are actually pretty comical! Somebody asked Akira Toriyama why Trunks and Goten don't have tails. His response? \"Uhhh... They got them removed at birth.\" He totally forgot that they were supposed to have tails. XD Also, it's hilarious how Frieza says that Namek only has 5 minutes to explode, but yet Goku and Frieza fight for about 2 more hours! Anyway, it might be a bit hard to get into at first, but once you do, you'll most likely fall in love with it. Goku has even become an icon. This is also the only anime that's really long that I'll watch. I never was able to get into Naruto, One Peace, Bleach, and had never even heard of Gintama. So with anime this long, it's either a hit or a miss. And it depends on how much time you want to spend on it. Anyway, that pretty much sums up my review. DBZ in a nutshell.\

    If you're a fighting, superpower anime connoisseur like me, then even if you've never watched this anime before, you've probably heard about it a crapload of times. It took me awhile to get into this anime; I've been into anime for at least 4 years now, and only decided to get into DB this year. I was really excited, but as I got more and more into it, I felt more and more disappointed. The Cell Arc is what led me to the decision to drop this anime completely, which I'll explain below. This review has spoilers by the way, so please don't read beyond\
          \
        the next paragraph if you don't want to be spoiled. Although knowing this fandom, I'm sure you've been spoiled about it too like I have.\
Anyways, to be quite honest, mostly everything in DBZ plot wise was just one ass pull followed by another ass pull. Goku is the main star of the show, yet he's completely overshadowed by his son, Son Gohan. I tried to put up with it, since Goku was clearly much stronger than him after the Freiza Arc, having been the first to attain Super Saiyan mode, but he ends up outdoing him after that. But that isn't what pisses me off; actually I came to appreciate Gohan as the show went on. \
What pisses me off is what happens in the Cell Arc. First, Trunks comes from the future to tell them about the Artificial Humans. This isn't what bothers me btw; in fact I'm perfectly fine with it. What makes this an ass pull is that Trunks reveals he's Bulma and Vegeta's kid. Like??? It's too fucking early for that...I was hoping after I'd gotten spoiled by other anime fans I'd met who happened to be huge DB fans...like I said, I'm a superpower fighting anime connoisseur.\
That being said...or reiterated; take your pick, I have a lot of connections to people of the same interests. And most of those people are huge DB fans. The reason I've hesitated to get into this anime for so long even though it fits all my criteria is because I've been spoiled so much about it that I figured what's the point of watching this show? I already knew so much about it thanks to other people...but anyway, as I was saying I was hoping after I'd gotten spoiled by DB fans that maybe Toriyama might take it slow and gradually reveal their interest in each other, but no.  \
Shortly after Freiza's defeated, literally for a few episodes those two interact and the next thing we know Bulma and Yamucha break up and Bulma's literally all like, \"So I fucked Vegata and this is our kid....\" Like? What? The? Fuck? That's exactly the reason I didn't want to get into this anime to begin with?? And when he revealed that he was their kid to Goku I wanted to drop it right there but I decided to keep watching, since I knew it could be much worse.\
It didn't bother me that Goku was going to leave defeating Cell to Gohan; what bothered me was that he was going to stay in the Next World and not for like a short period of time like he did in the Saiyan Arc. Had it been like that I wouldn't have minded; I decided to do some research and found out that even more asspulls laid in wait. The bitch stays dead for seven years, come back for some shitty tournament for like a day, then goes back to being dead again. The entire fucking thing made me want to fucking punch the walls in my room (which would probably break it because this house is so fucking cheap, but anyways. Irrelo and not hilarious side comment is irrelo and not hilarious). \
Again, Goku is the star of the show. Like you can't expect me to continue watching this after he's dead for 7 freaking years and comes back like nothing happen. Not to mention Goten coming into existence just like that makes no sense at all. How and when did Chichi and Goku even find the time to fuck? I mean really...Toriyama could've at least made Chichi seem like she was pregnant, but he didn't. Also the fact that Gohan grew up so fucking much after the Cell Arc and even has a girlfriend without literally any explanation or anything leading up to it didn't help at all.\
Anyways, I couldn't take it and so I decided to drop this anime. There's probably not anymore superpower fighting anime that I could watch now - at least, not any decent ones. I feel like I've seen it all at this point. But I've never felt more disappointed in an anime like I have in Dragon Ball. The entire thing just crashed and burned with the Cell Arc all because Toriyama revealed too much and explained too little all at once. Like when Goku grew up in the Piccolo Jr Arc and shit w/o an explanation, it didn't bother me because it wasn't that big of a deal. Plus it was about damn time he grew an inch or two, or several, and for what it was worth the events had already been clearly laid out. But the way he handled the Cell Arc and the beginning of the Majinn Buu Saga was rushed as hell to the point where it didn't even make any damn sense.\
I partly blame this fandom for spoiling the fuck out of me on this anime for my decision to drop the anime. If I hadn't been spoiled, I would've followed along no big deal prolly, but because I was spoiled, I began to expect shit to go a certain way because of the spoilers given to me in the past. If you're going to get into this anime and you've been spoiled a lot on it like me, then don't expect it to go a certain way, take it all at face value, and don't get attached. All I'll say.\

    It's automatically a given that the action in Dragon Ball Z is great. Despite what a lot of others may think, the show has a lot more going for it. Dragon Ball Z has you get invested early on in these characters like Goku, Gohan, Vegeta etc. and watch them grow not only physically but also mentally with every challenge they face. However, the storytelling has a lot of glaring flaws. Arcs tend to be formulaic in structure, with Goku constantly being taken in and out of the story. There are countless major plotholes throughout that are never addressed. The Buu Saga throws away the\
          \
        entire overarching narrative and make the entire conclusion of the previous arc pointless. The dub, while I expected the acting to be bad considering it was made it the 90s, changes a lot of the dialogue to something completely different and almost gives off the impression that the character is something that he's not. While it's far from perfect, Dragon Ball Z is definitely worth the watch if you like action (assuming you haven't already)\

    For a show about fighting there sure is a lot of talking. Of course, this is all to built up suspension and give the show an identity. In retrospect, even though it was quite the ride, I find that as an older Anime fan it has its fair share of shortcomings. Sure we all still remember the charming characters and epic fights but then there was also the recycling of animations and overly long drawn out expositions which make this a flawed but enjoyable show. \
I'm sure that everything else has been said about DBZ so I'll leave you with this:\
I wouldn't recommend it to\

        seasoned Anime fans but to those new to the genre, give it a go and see for yourself if it has any redeeming qualities. \

    Dragonball Z; this was the show that I grew up with and continue to watch to this day. I plan to one day get all the DVD collections for all 9 seasons of this show. When I was a kid, this was the show that I had to watch everyday because I just loved it that much. One thing I never understood though is why this one came out before Dragonball, it didn't really make any sense. The manga clearly existed before Dragonball Z, so why didn't Dragonball come out before Dragonball Z? Well, I don't really have the answer and don't care because I\
          \
        really didn't enjoy Dragonball. \
Dragonball Z was a classic and epic show and will always be one of my old childhood classics. The story while keeping the viewers engaged and was great overall, there were here and there a few things about certain parts of the story that really didn't make any sense and came right the hell out of nowhere, but overall; was a very well written story. The art work and animation; superb! The art and designs of the characters were great along with the designs of some of the cities and everything. The music, outstanding; it had some of the best music and sound that I had ever listen to, especially; that rock opening theme was just great. The characters were great too, especially; Vegeta, who I can say without boast, is my most favorite character of them all. I do like Goku too, but Vegeta will always rain supreme in my mind since he was such a badass. \
Overall; everything about this show was just great. It's still one of my most favorites and I will not rest, until I've collected all the DVD collections so I can watch it over and over again. \

    The latter part of the dragaonball manga is Dragonball Z. This anime has such a strong following and it's easy to see why. This series set the bar for super-power/action/fighting anime, and even new viewers will have the super saiyan ability on the brain after watching this. Though it goes over the top later in the series, the message remains the same throughout. Honor, friendship, doing the right thing. These are elements that carry through many dragonball z wannabe series that follow.\
Goku has a family now. His son gohan has potential that far exceeds his. but his mother doesn't want him fighting and brawling like\
          \
        his father. When their family's origins come to light as a new threat comes to their planet, soon it will take every great hero the planet has to protect them. Training through life and death with each new threat that comes, the entire universe opens to this family of saiyans. Throughout the series, Earth's protectors become guardians of the universe.\
If you have never seen Z, then you should make some time to see where a lot of your favorites have most definitely gotten their inspiration from. The wonderful characters, slapstick comedy, and incredible fight scenes make this anime stand above most others. Even though it's an older series, it does hold up well over time. The audio is the only real problem if you want to talk quality.\
Fanboy comments aside, Dragonball Z was rereleased later to shorten some of the dragged out mistakes. Watching the hero and villain take turns increasing their power can be a little tedious at parts of the story, but I like to count the amount of times they exchange that role. It's good for a laugh.\
Don't let this amazing series escape your viewing pleasure.\

    Dragon Ball Z is easily most most epic and popular Anime ever. (At least in the States) \
DBZ picks up Goku's adventure a few years later after he's settled down and had a son, Gohan. Things pick up from the very first episode as Goku's Brother, Raditz, lands on Earth and Goku and Piccolo start to learn of their mysterious origins. \
The animation for Dragon Ball Z is great to this day. I watched the series in Blu Ray and it can rival Anime from the early 2000's in terms of animation quality easily. The character designs are great and the backgrounds are drastically improved\
          \
        from Dragon Ball.\
The characters themselves are well written and are what is so great about the series. From the Z-Fighters to any of the villains, they more than make up for the slightly repetitive plot of saving Earth time and time again.\
Overall DBZ is a great follow up to the Dragon Ball series with comedy toned down and tons of action. There is a reason this show is so popular and why it got so many people interested in Anime in the first place.\

    Review contains Spoilers.\
Dragonball Ball Z is arguably the most influential and popular anime in existence. Most anime and non anime fans have grown up watching the anime and thus it holds a special place in them as nostalgia. However is it really among the best anime that exist, well in simply words no, it's not nearly well written or even enjoyable in s majeway. Anyway let's get to the specifics.\
Story-5\
The story is pretty much simple and easy to follow however due to its easiness there is literally no scope for any dilemma. The series pretty much focusses on the sayen life of Goku the main\
          \
        character.\
It's divided into three specific arcs and it shows the different problems that the main characters have to deal with. While the first half of the series was tolerable due to the freshness of the concept and character dynamics, the second half introduces new characters and concepts and pretty much the freshness begins to dry out and m story becomes pretty reductant. Then we get to the biggest \
problem with the entire anime and that it's it's pacing. The anime is pretty much renowned in having the example of filler arcs and that precisely drags down the flow of the story.  The entire buu arc felt like it was told based on no script and in honestly that arc pretty much was the low point of the series. Moreover the actual story did get buried away because of the countless battles in the series.\
Art-7\
Despite being sold on animation I was still sold on the artwork of Dragonball Ball Z. It's nothing noteworthy however it did make the actual battles much more interesting and the infamous 5 minute \
battle in name wouldn't nearly be as fun without the contrasting \
color patterns between the characters. However the art pretty much remained stagnant throughout the series so yeah it's not a standout factor.\
Sound-7 \
The overall sound was good. The battle sounds especially were pretty solid and it did enhance the actual conflict. The ost's were pretty forgettable and the scores weren't deep or even emotional to be considered great.\
Characters-4\
This is were Dragonball ball Z fails tremendously. The actual characters are the weakest point of the entire series. Despite bring the most influential Anime character in existence Goku is neither a deep nor a great character. He has absolutely no character development in the entire series and is basically an overpowered hero who doesn't even strive to go through any moral development. The only noteworthy characters of the entire cast are Vegeta, Piccolo and Future Trunks. The rest of the characters are just there for the sake of being there and doesn't even contribute anything for it.Gohan, Goku's son had probably the best character development by the end of the second half is completely thrown aside during its final arc thereby rendering his development useless. The main characters of the original Dragonball ball anime were either tossed aside or avoided to fill in the new one's. Even the characters death had no effect on their development as the series pretty much allowed them to be brought back to life.\
Enjoyment - 7\
This is tough, although I ranted on the flowed storytelling and useless characters i still very much enjoyed the series due to its fights and ham.\
Overall - 5\
While the anime did keep me entertained it really didn't give much to appreciate for and since it went from the direction of good to bad it's Fairly fitting that I call it mediocre.\

      text = "Dragon Ball Z is a show that you can enjoy whether you’re eight or eighteen. I saw this cartoon for the first time at the age of nine years when it peaked in my country of South Africa and tidal waves of merchandise were visible as far as your eye could see, be it videogames or movies. I watched as many episodes as I could and when me and my friends couldn’t think about anything interesting to talk about, we’d talk about DBZ. I re-watched DBZ recently and my opinion has changed a bit from way back then.\
Dragon Ball Z is the sequel to the\
          \
        excellent Dragon Ball, where our hero is once again, the guy who started the dumb, funny and strong shonen hero trend, Goku who along with his friends protect the earth from villains who want the dragon balls for themselves and use it take over the world/galaxy. The plot stays exactly the same for the whole series which is divided into four major story arcs. The story is unoriginal and can get repetitive very fast. Like I said previously, Dragon Ball was a really satisfactory and pleasurable cartoon which was an adventure comedy for the most part. Dragon Ball Z however is an action adventure that feels inferior to its prequel that has a story second and countless action scenes first. This show has a large following and many people know what makes and breaks this anime, so what I’m writing about may have been heard or known by quite a few of you.\
The story isn’t bad but drags on for a long time. The series contains super-sized fillers which Dragon Ball Z Kai managed to fix. Instead of adding an episode with no relation to the main plot, fight scenes were extended that lasted months, as wikipedia stated(SPOILER): that the last five minutes before the explosion of Namek which lasted five episodes is the most infamous of these.(END SPOLIER) The four major arcs were really good on their own if you hadn’t told yourself \"the exact same thing just happened for almost the past year\".  On the spectrum of enjoyment from best to poorest the arcs are as follows : Majin Buu Saga, Planet Namek Saga, Android Saga, Sayain Saga. The Majin Buu Saga really manages to try new things and changes the formula a little bit by introducing new charcters like the awesome duo Trunks and Goten(and a whole lot of new and actually likeable characters, including the funniest and coolest villian in the entire show), Goku's role isn't so major at the beginning and some of the other supporting characters don't show up so much and with experimenting here the arc exceeds the previous three.\
The animation for this show isn’t abysmal as it starts out ok and just gets better. The faces of a lot of the male characters look identical with their hair making a lot of difference. It took me quite some time to notice it so it may not be that off putting to viewers. The fight scenes were not bad, the animators had no option with this seeing as this is an action show. There were various shots that were re-used here and during a lot of the moves used during battle, lines would replace the limbs of the characters to show the fighters’ lightning fast speed. The animation has more hits than misses because the animation becomes more fluid, brighter and sharper later on. The characters also appear as bodybuilding archetypes as the show progresses. Backgrounds appear as re-used but are not that noticeable.\
The sound changed completely in the American version which made fans of the original livid. Cha La, the original opening theme was replaced with a rock n’ roll heavy metal piece which I have to admit I was partial to which also changed throughout the series. The silence that was in the original in between battles and during stare downs got changed with guitar riffs. Goku’s English voice is a lot more tolerable than the Japanese counterpart, which is the case with quite a few  of the characters(with the exception of Frieza, who I was convinced was a woman), while some may argue the more cartoony voices like that of Vegeta and Piccolo are not up to snuff. Another reason some fans react negatively to the DBZ dub is the inclusion of words like “darn it”, “dude” etc. You may also hear that the word “kill” is seldom used if ever and usually in its place is “destroy”.\
The characters were a little hard to get attached to because if they died, they just got wished back with the dragon balls which took a lot of the suspense and tension away later during the show’s run. There is enough character development to keep one happy, characters grow older, which I haven’t seen a lot in anime and it was fun to see the introduction of new characters and how the older ones changed. Some female characters come off as more annoying than funny or likeable( Bulma, Chi Chi). The same can be said for male characters like Yamcha for instance. There are however some show stealers like sexual pervert and martial arts teacher Master Roshi and the self obsessed moronic martial arts champion/wuss Hercule( Mr. Satan in the original) who are all supporting characters. \
DBZ was a phenomenon back in its hey day, and it’s not difficult to see why. The dub made quite a few changes to the show but if you haven’t seen the original you won’t notice a thing and on its own it really is not that bad. It inspired popular shonen shows like Fairy Tail, One Piece, Naruto and Bleach but with all the new anime that manage to surpass it, it just seems like some forgettable cartoon. Dragon Ball Z is not as good as Dragon Ball but is so much better than Dragon Ball GT. I’m still a fan of the show and I love it, especially for nostalga.If you’re looking for a really long adventure cartoon or just a fun animated show, please do yourself a favour and give the English version a try if you haven’t watched it yet.

    Good things about DBZ : epicness(epic music), awesome characters, good art, and it's one of the bests in it's genre : \"nekketsu\"(which means the main characters fight for long against very tough opponents without losing hope like in Naruto or OnePiece).\
Bad things about DBZ : there isn't much character developpement, there's a bunch of fillers.\
*awesome characters = All the main characters have different functions in the story. All though, some of them become useless throughout the series.\
So, is it a masterpiece ?\
No, DBZ is a great anime, but it isn't a masterpiece. If you thought it was a lasterpiece, and  you rated it \"10/10\",\
          \
        then it means you haven't watched any masterpieces until now.\

    How should we view DBZ? To write out all its flaws would take me all day. Simpley put, it's animation is frustratingly stifled and the characters tend to have the personality of an baked potato. And yet it appears to be an anime we simply cannot do without.\
 It's presence is mapped in the style of nearly every modern shonen. DBZ is thus a bit like Homer, its sheer archetypal presence dwarfs any attempt at reviewing it. \
Despite this, there is something that drew me to it in the 90's. It was something I'd never seen-a non-episodic epic narrative. Battle were based on raw power\
          \
        and abilities. Further, characters would routinely die. The Batman and Superman cartoons, while great for its time, would be loathe in indulge in something so violent. \
Anti-hero figures like Vegeta and Piccolo are recurring wild cards, upsetting the action just as things became stale. This made having a \"favorite\" character much more appealing. \
Compare this to Batman and Superman where the titular hero's persona was the ultimate focus. Because of this, the favorite character would tend to be the hero itself. This is something even anime like \"Fist of the North Star\" struggle with.\
\
The newness of these concepts cannot be understated. Even now, I think the narrative structure of DBZ is compelling when viewed next to contemporary shows. DBZ is a bedrock to a lot of modern shonen, but it is ultimately a good one to have.\

    Well, I used to love this show when I was younger. One of my favorite shows, in fact. But now, it's different. I'm looking at this anime, and I just wish that it had done so much better so that I could remember it with a better light. It should also be known that I rate most anime pretty high on my list, probably higher than I should, yet this one is one of the only ones I have given such a low rating. There are only a few things I think of being good in this show looking at it now, so now let's\
          \
        dig right in to why I think this anime is very bad.\
Story:\
This is probably the weakest point in the series, and is the main reason that I give it such a low score. At least in the original Dragon Ball, the story actually could get pretty interesting, and wasn't just \"fight this enemy, now fight this enemy cause they're a threat, now fight this enemy cause they're a threat.\" That's basically all that happens in the story. they go around fighting a whole bunch of different enemies, and while the action is very enjoyable, there just isn't a lot of depth as to why they're doing it other than they're going to destroy the whole world or universe or something like that. However, there are some pretty cool aspects to this story like the whole fusion, super sayian (though that got repetitive after they got to 3), and hyperbolic time-chamber. Otherwise, I just felt like it was too basic.\
Art/Animation:\
As for art, I can't really say much about it as I do not know the limits of how well-made art in anime could be back in the 80s. But I guess I'd say it's not really pleasing to look at, especially with their color choices. But I guess the animation was alright.\
Sound:\
Pretty basic sounds, but I guess it was fine.\
Character:\
Now, this one thing is probably the biggest factor that contributed to my low rating. Not exactly the characters themselves, but the fact that you get like two or three reoccurring female characters throughout the whole show, and only one of them is an actual fighter. And even then, she's an android, so I guess she doesn't really have a sex. Now, the actual characters themselves are also pretty bad, there only being two characters that I actually liked. The main thing I like when watching an anime is characters that I can get really attached to and emotional over, which happens quite a lot for me in most anime. However, here, they are just way to basic, uninteresting, or annoying that I just can't really get attached to them. Goku is just you're average hero who only really cares about saving the world, and not really anybody else. he even made his son go into fighting at the age of around 4. That's just not right. And Vegeta, I can't even handle him. All he cares about his pride and even when he decides that he'd like to make a life on Earth, he shows that he doesn't really care about it, particularly when he lets himself be taken over by Babidi so that he can feel \"pure evil\" again. The only two characters that I found in this show were Gohan and Piccolo. These were two characters who never acted annoying, were pure-hearted. Gohan himself was pretty cute in personality and proved to be more interesting then the others. Overall, the characters just weren't made well.\
So, overall I give this show a 3. This show was very important to me when I was little, but unfortunately not everything can be viewed in the same way when you get older. I really wish it had been done better, so that I could still love it the same way I did as a child, but I guess not all anime will be written that well.\

    (This review needs to be updated, I will update when I get time)\
If you are a 90s kid and haven't spent your time trying to become a super saiyan or using Kamehama, I don't know what you have been doing with life. I would say go use a time machine because you missed an important part of growing up. Goku is the iconic hero that many kids might have even idolized.\
But then why would I just give it 8 rather than 10.\
First of all the pace of plot, it has been too prolonged literary sometimes you waste an entire episode waiting for a fight but\
          \
        you just see them hysterically screaming, charging attack or transforming and when you think something is about to happen, you hear that voice saying \"Find out in the next episode of Dragon ball Z\". But this isn't the only reason.\
Second is lack of character development. OK there are few developed characters but other are just forgotten. In fact Launch is completely forgotten. But let's talk about characters with great personality development that would be Vegeta, Piccolo and Gohan.\
We saw Gohan grew up and gradually becoming the lovable super saiyan 2 that defeated Cell. Almost a perfect continual of a great legacy. And then what we saw an unforgiving excuse called Great Saiyaman. I mean seriously how badly you can make a character fall. Ok Mystic Gohan somewhat covered up in Z at least but not to mention him in Super.\
Second Piccolo, a badass demon prince we knew and in fact my favourite character and Toriyama, well accd to what he said. Well apparently he is not demon just from slug people but that isn't the issue. I love his character development but he has been so embarrassingly pushed a side. He can't even be recognized as a main character. Just a baby sitter and trainer\
Vegeta, he wasn't as cool as many assume him to be. I spoiled proud brat who got his ego hurt by being defeated by someone of lower race, typical racist. Making a badass entry and then getting thrashed. But eventually we saw him evolve and he became a legend known as Majin Vegeta we all admire. At least he is the only developed character who hadn't fallen in Z, though he do fall in Super.\
The second would be same typical shonen fighting style and under developed villains. The only developed villain in Z is Cell or Dr.Gero. Cell in spite being best is basically a cry baby who when strong acts like an arrogant willing to show his power when strong and pitifully begging when weak. But still DBZ is a landmark in its era in this case and foundation of better anime future.\
So this isn't half of my disappointment. The greatest disappointment is Goku. Sorry to break it to you, but Goku isn't the heroic character you know, not at least as much as many think. Beside being a terrible father, he is basically a simpleton who is obsessed with fighting strong opponents and is in fact pretty much selfish. If you find what I just said awkward, I think you would not have not wondered why Goku personality is so much different in Super. I would recommend you to read manga or watch DBZ sub and u will realize how much Dub has changed his personality into something heroic. Seriously unlike DB, there is negligible personality development and its truely disappointing\

    Dragon Ball Z is My favorite Anime Series of All Time, I've been asked before Why its remained my favorite for so long and the only answer I can come up with is that its Great. I know that's a really short answer but I can't think of another answer that doesn't involve Spoilers. The Story is Great, the Characters are Great, the Battles are Great, the Art Style is great, hell even the Animation is Great for the time it came out.

    Ok heres my review for a little somethin called Dragonball Z.\
Really the plot is just horrible. Heres the plot: These guys wanna randomly want to destroy the planet cause they feel like it. then these other guys feel like fighting them cause there 'super powerful'\
really that IS IT. Its the plot for the 4 main arks and all the filler.\
I am not over exaggerating at all, i dont hate DBZ at all. I just think generically not great. \
Then somehow the creator feels like making someone die then come back. It happens like all the time. Then they feel like making about 4 forms for\
          \
        each character that make them 'stronger'. Then each character will moan and yell for about half the episode for no reason or in there head its because they feel like 'powering up'.\
Geh, the art couldve been better. I gave it a could because its pretty old, and you have to think about it at the time period.\
The sound is the same as the art.\
Character wasnt bad, but they all almost had the same personality. I didnt find a character that stood out or was different. It has characters who feel like being good and characters who feel like being bad and characters who have no point. There isnt reason or depth behind them at all, nor is there reasoning behind their powers. \
Seriously i wouldnt spend your time watching this anime. If you really want to watch a generic action anime go watch bleach and naruto. At least its not moan, fight, boom, yell, fight, fight, come back to life, third form, fourth form, fight, fight.  Then if you want to watch an anime that is action, to bad cause all of either arent great without any depth or youll find it being mixed with about 2 or more other genres.\

    When you hear the name: dragon ball z, you will most likely get an instant adrenaline rush. Why? Because I can't stress it enough when I say it, but DRAGON BALL Z KICKS ASS! And I'm here to explain why. I will begin with the story. The story picks up after the previous events of dragon ball, and I think for the first season, it shows a pretty good synopsis of the present day events of Goku and the others. When the first villi an comes, who is Raditz by the way. He clims to be Goku's brother! And now Radits threatens to harm Goku's\
          \
        son, Gohan. Now goku and Piccolo have to team up to stop him. That's only the first part to season one. But I want to keep this short ill move on to the animation. Dragon ball z is very famous for their super speed action and stunning fight scenes. But they need a little build up for them, but this the only minor flaw this show has, you see, people complain about DBZ having too much talking. But I think it's all worth it to see those legendary fights. And some of the talking is actually meaningful and cool at times. Now lets talk about final score. In all honesty, dragon ball Z is still one my favorite amines of all time. And still has a huge cult following to this day. And I can see why. Thanks for your patience, and have an amazing day! Be sure to check out my other reviews. I'm planning to make a part 2 of this review when I get to it. Cheers!!!\

    DragonBall Z started it all for me. \
This was the series that got me into anime.\
Like many other people, I was a child (10 years old) when I first tuned into DBZ, and I have been addicted ever since. Seriously, it just doesn't get old, like a classic soap opera.\
DBZ continues where the ever cute Dragonball finishes off...\
Our main character, Goku, is now an adult who is now married with a child, living a peaceful life in the mountains. \
That is until trouble strikes.\
Goku and friends are then thrust back into the adventureous lifestyle they lived in the past, only this time, their journeys take\
          \
        them; outerspace and to the afterlife, fighting a  range of villians from all walks of creation. \
Dragonball Z features many great saga's, in which dispite they serious storylines, still manage to be fun enough to keep you in a good mood and keep you addicted to the very end.\
Also, you can't help but love the characters of the very dysfunctional Z gang.\
You may end up like me, going through the episodes again and again for years? Yet I'm crazy.\

    DBZ is an anime classic. If you want to get someone into anime try this out. The action is the best the story is awesome,my favorite personally is the cell saga, and overall its just awesome. 1 problem I do have with this anime is that they dragged the Buu saga out too long I mean you kill the Buu once sacrificing somebody's life but suddenly he's still alive he just keeps regenerating they just dragged that saga out too long, but overall DBZ is awesome.\

    Dragonball Z is probably one of my more memorable anime titles that I got into when I was younger. It was flashy, had colorful, vibrant characters, and at the time, a fairly epic story. But, it also had it's fair share of problems. Let's begin.\
 STORY: DBZ starts out early with a really easy story that doesn't take a lot to get into. The heroes have a year to prepare for powerful warriors called saiyans on there way to earth to wish for immortality, which proceeds in a really cool, unforgettable clash between Goku and Vegeta. From there, the story gets even better as it\
          \
        briefly gives fans a throwback to fun adventures in Dragonball with a quest to Namek, introducing a new array of villians like Frieza and my personal favorites, the Ginyu Force. This is where I think Dragonball Z reaches it's apex in story, and none of the other story arcs ever reach the importance or the drama that the first two sagas captured. \
 Take for instace the Androids. They're introduced by Trunks in such a grim matter of urgency you almost can't wait to see how they struggle with this new threat to the earth. But the androids themselves are immediately dropped in favor of Cell as the new threat, and most of his story is just filler and the characters standing around doing nothing. Although his battle with Goku was good, it didn't last very long and ultimately lead to an anticlimactic finale. Things started to look up at the beginning of the Buu saga. Gohan is the earth's new hero, and introduces new characters Videl, Goten, and the Kais, but this story arc is way too long and might lose steam before the action picks back up, and people might lose interest. And then the show doesn't really end, it just kind of stops.\
 ART: The art is very endearing in a manner that only Akira Toriyama can bring. All the fighters look different in their unique way, from Tien's third eye, to the Namek Piccolo. The fight scenes are fun at first, but instantly get very repetitive, sometimes the same attack animations are used in the same fight, just slightly sped up a bit. You'll see what I mean when you watch Goku vs android 19. Ditto with the energy attacks. It starts out fresh, but there is little variation beyond a Kamehameha or Special Beam Cannon. \
 As the series progresses, the character designs become insanely detailed and much more crisp, but my biggest peeve with the art is the background. It never changes and it seems like ALL the fights take place in the same desolate rock field. There aren't any night battles either, or battle that take place in a city for variety. The super saiyan transformations are all incredible and is where the shading really stands out the most.\
 SOUND: The is great in it's original format, but watching the new remastered dub gives this anime one of the best english dubs I've ever listened to. The American soundtrack by Bruce Faulconer has memorable tunes like character themes, dramatic battle climaxes, and great guitar riffs. Funimations work on this product was so great, you wouldn't believe this show was made alomst 20 years ago.\
 CHARACTER: The characters kind of stand out at first, but there's very little character development DBZ. The only original personality is Gohan, and it's a blast watching him grow up in front of your eyes from a pampered 5 year old to one of the strongest warriors with a messed up sense of humor. And Piccolo's transformation from Goku's evil rival to a good natured mentor makes him easily the best character in the show. Sadly it's kind of downhill from there. All of the recurring cast members from Dragonball (except Launch) are back and aren't really any different. Goku is still the same innocent, childish guy, Bulma is still shrill and annoying, Krillin is basically a second banana early on, but is no longer a major player in the series. Tienshinhan, Yamcha, and Chaozu are practically ignored, and the rest are lame comic relief for the most part. The villans start off fresh, as mentioned before, but begin to lack originallity. Even Buu begins to use other peoples techniques, which is annoying, because the villian before him, Cell, did the same thing. And then there's the overrated Prince of Babies himself, Vegeta. I never understood what people liked so much about him. Is he supposed to be a bad-ass? This guy to me is the worst aspect of all of DBZ for an infinite amount of reasons. He's grating, he cries about Kakarot all the time because he lost a fight, which is stupid because aren't the saiyans supposed to look for a good fight? Then this guy loses in a good fight and whines about it for ten years??!!! Get a life!!! I could go on forever about him alone.\
ENJOYMENT: This is a very easy show to get sucked into, and the first two atory arcs are infinitely fun to watch, but later on it drags a little bit, and loses a lot of story telling in favor of training. When the characters reach a new pinnacle of power, the concept of techniques and looking to eploit an opponent's weakness fades away in favor of just turning into smash battle all the time, which gets stale. After the Frieza saga, the best part of the show is The Saiyaman saga and everyone reuniting after seven years. It's kind of heart-warming after watching the show for so long to see everyone briefly together. Some of the filler before the Cell games is pretty decent, but pointless.\
 OVERALL: I give this show a 7 out of ten. It's not as good as the original mostly because it's too long, but it is definately a shonen classic with decent rewatch value.\

    Dragonball Z is an all-time classic. I know all anime fans are different, some people think it is overrated, some think that it was better than anyone made it out to be but in all honesty I would rate Dragonball Z higher than any other anime that I have ever watched.\
The story is very unique 7 dragonballs scattered around the Earth that can give the one who gathers all seven any wish they desire and a group of heroes out there to stop them.\
The character design is amazing and this along with their personalities make up for the long and repetative fights throughout the series.\
I\
          \
        have truly never seen a better action anime than Dragonball Z. I like Naruto, Bleach and all them but Dragonball Z will always be one of a kind.\
Not much maturity overall except for the violence (which is quite mild by the way unlike other anime that would be even harder to watch) but I would definatley say that Dragonball Z should be for people 10 upwards, no one younger should watch it. Its sequel Dragonball GT would be suitable for younger kids and the prequel Dragonball should be for people 9 and older.\
I hope that my review has helped anyone who would like to check out this anime.\

    Dragon Ball Z! I wouldn't be able to throw a brick and not hit someone who didn't know what DBZ is. This is the show that introduced me to anime and will always have a special place on my shelf. Growing up and following the adventures of Goku and friends was amazing and seeing all of the fights were an epic rush! The only downside for some people is this show has a lot of filler, talking, and screaming but with to me it was awesome!!\

    WHAT IS THIS?! YOU RANK THIS LESS THAN A 10 YOU PIECE OF SH*T! HOW DARE YOU CALL YOURSELF A DRAGON BALL FAN! THIS IS CLEARLY THE BEST OF ALL THE DRAGON BALL SERIES!\
I ask those people, \"Do you even care about the story? Do you even care about quality?\" Ok, it's not THAT bad but this show is slightly above average for me.\
Note: If I don't put down the JP name of some characters, that's because either I don't know it, or I'm not comfortable putting it in the review, realizing it's wrong, and making myself look like a complete idiot.\
Note: I'm including the\
          \
        filler from this show. Don't even complain; it's a part of the show, and I'm going to treat it as such.\
Story: 5\
Between the 23rd Tenkaichi Budokai and the 1st episode of Z, around 5 years have passed (I hope that's right lol) with peace. Goku, his wife Chi-chi and their child Son Gohan are enjoying their lives. Bulma dumps Yamucha (fail to see the surprise there) and goes to Kame house to relieve some stress...I think. Enter Raditz, a Saiyan who went to Earth to check up on Kakarotto due to him being sent to Earth...in which he also discloses that Goku...is also a Saiyan...and thus the story begins.\
The overall story is one big roller-coaster. In the Saiyan arc, it reaches its peak in terms of quality. From there on, it keeps going down and down. The filler in the Saiyan arc is good; no complaints there.\
The Freeza arc is good, but the filler before it and some scenes during the arc makes the whole arc DRAG ASS! The fight with Freeza is over 30 episodes...that's too much for me.\
The filler right before the Artificial Humans arc was an interesting idea, just wasn't executed very well.\
The Artificial Humans arc was good...until Cell shows up. With Cell's appearance, it's creates a time paradox, which is annoying as hell, combined with some sequences that also drag the arc down as well, it ends up being an average arc...no, not even the SSJ2 (SSJ Grade 5) transformation salvages this entire arc. (Watch Detective Q's Video on the multiple timelines; it actually makes sense.)\
The Other-world tournament arc was really good; no complaints there (except the power scaling.)\
The Majin Buu arc is where the show is at it's worst. You have the completely overpowered enemy that comes out of nowhere, decimates SSJ2 Gohan and SSJ2 Majin Vegeta and is able to mimic other techniques...OP. Goku has SSJ3 which he got through training off-screen and he learned a fusion technique...which I can let slide. Then, Majin Buu transforms into Majin Buu (Evil)...and this is where ass-pulls come into play. Gotenks achieved SSJ3 out of nowhere, surpassing Goku, Gohan has his full latent potential unlocked (I like calling him Mystic Gohan; it sound awesome!), Gohan becomes an idiot and lets Buu absorb SSJ3 Gotenks and Piccolo, which completely overwhelms him, Elder Kaioshin introduces Potara fusion which comes completely out of left field and other contrived story issues which I can write a 3-page essay on...but that would be a waste of time...just like this arc. It DRAGS ASS with its contrived story-telling and idiotic characters.\
Art/Action: 5\
The art-style is almost identical to the original DB.\
The animation is a different story. The animation, starting with the appearance of Vegeta becomes a complete cluster-fuck in terms of animation quality with most fight scenes getting the exception in this case. Animation in non-fighting scenes can either be really good, or really bad which is really distracting (NOT AS BAD AS THE RESURRECTION F ARC IN SUPER!).\
The action sequences themselves are really good; the animation around the action is actually lazy, but that works to the action's benefit. Despite Toei having a strict budget while animating this show, these fight scenes have more quality than the first 3 arcs of Super. Good action overall\
Sound: 8\
The OST is very good. There is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said.\
Characters: 6\
After the Saiyan Arc, the character usage has slowly been diminishing with exception to the Artificial Humans arc. In the Freeza arc, only a handful of the Z fighters cast as been used, but considering the situation, that's fine with me. The Majin Buu arc...what happened? All of a sudden, nobody else is even useful in the slightest? W.T.F???\
Enjoyment: 8\
Despite the negatives, I've really enjoyed all 4 of these arcs. Even with the ass-pulls of the Buu arc, the time paradox in the Artificial Humans arc, the slow-ass pacing in the Freeza arc...I still enjoyed it.\
Overall: 6\
At the end of the day, the show got worse the longer it progressed and it also shows in the manga, but in the anime, it's even worse. In the end, it all combines to just being above average, it's nothing too special, but I can't deny that this made an impact in the anime industry, and nobody will ever forget that about this show.\

    Who doesn't even heard of Dragon Ball or the iconic meme ''It's over 9000!''? It was part of my childhood. In fact, it was my first anime. I can't bring myself dissing  on it. To me, the plot was not that great. But, it was entertaining. It's just like any shounen anime where a lot of explosion, a lot of punch and a beam. It is a perfect show for kids. Which is why I once thought that this show is the greatest cartoon show ever. I called it cartoon before. The art was good for a show in 80's I guess. The design\
          \
        of Super Saiyan, Kaioken, even the enemies like Frieza with all of his form and Cell. The androids and all. It was great in that era. Although the animation is not perfect, it's still better than the sequel. Now, the character is so admirable. For example, Goku. I really love his character who is very cheerful and kind to all people. I also like Vegeta, a prideful prince that just would do anything to get stronger. There's other memorable characters that I can pick but I'm too lazy to describe them all.  There are so many enjoyment and nostalgic that I got from this series and I even re watched from the beginning of Dragon Ball to the end. I even enjoyed GT. That's how big fan I am of this franchise. To sum up this review, even this series is classic and quite long. It's worth it. At least give it a go.\

Story: 9/10\
I will not say that Dragon Ball z is perfect, because it's not.  It actually has a lot of plot holes.  But this anime was the one that started it all-when it comes to shounen anime. Also no matter how many times I've seen it, every time Son Goku is fighting I still can't help but feel amazed at how good the fight scenes were. \
There's no fan-service, No huge boobs girls fighting, no shipping\

For an anime that was made that time, the art was good. The effects they used and the way they showed the fight scenes are great.\

Dragon Ball Z is one of those anime that have a really catchy and good opening and ending songs. Almost everyone songs that they used are memorable, something that you will not forget once you heard it.\
The sound effects are good too.\

Almost every characters in Dragon Ball Z are popular. Even the side characters or enemies that only appear once.\

    How could you hate DBZ? It is one of the animes that popularized it in America.\
Looking now in 2017, of course it lacks a lot that current animes have? But intricate stories and deep characters isn't something every anime needs. Sometimes you want to turn your brain off and just see people beat each other up, and that is where DBZ shines.\
Storywise you just follow Goku on his quest to be stronger and stronger and overcome challenges that awaits him.\
DBZ isn't so much a anime to think hard about, but a journey into the life of Goku and his friends, and how they overcome evil\

        threats all the time. Ofc they are stupidly strong, but one can find enjoyment in that realm of fantasy once in a while.\

    The story of Dragon Ball Z could be announced as: the sequel of Goku's path toward a very simple dream of becoming stronger and fighting ever stronger folk - only now has a family, responsibilities, and can no longer face every threat with the ingenuity of a child. It really lacks the complexity of more recent material such as Naruto, One Piece and most currently successful shonen series. Why then is it still alive after so long? Perhaps is it precisely due to such simplicity, which makes the plot all the more engaging and original. Before you even realize it, you're eager to follow Goku's\
          \
        almost predictable development... After all, when you first met him he was but a little kid. Odds are you, too, were one back then. \
This strangely engaging story is filled with good quality fights that really set the bar to the shonen genre, good art, character development that ranges from great to nonexistent (whereas some characters, like Piccolo, Gohan and Vegeta, undergo substantial changes throughout the series, others don't change at all) and clearly separated arcs with interesting plots and remarkable antagonists. \
Dragon Ball and it's sequel have hardly aged a day. Both are must-see masterpieces, and thus they should remain. \

    Absolute MASTERPIECE 10 across the board. Without this revolutionary anime there not be many top animes that came after it. Way ahead of its time and influenced so much of the anime culture. Spread anime throughout the USA like bruce lee did with martial arts. Thank you for my childhood Goku and the rest of the earth's special forces.\

    Dont believe the criticism,dbz is a wonderful anime with a solid plot that carries on from the dragon ball prequel.It has wonderful elements of friendship that will leave you with fond memories .even if you hevent watch dragon ball you can get into dbz,starting from the saiyan saga,frieza saga to cell and buu saga  it is cripping.the character whether good are bad are intriguing.the best saga is without a doubt the frieza saga which spans severeal sub-storylines of vegeta versus freiza and his minions,goku space travel,krillin and gohan trying to survive on namek all coming together into an epic encounter between frieza the ultimate\
          \
        evil and goku the super saiyan of legend.\
Dbz is all about good verses evil and the battles between the two are the best you'll ever see,with some epic fight scenes that will leave your jaw hanging.There is also elements of character developement as  the  characters change with each new challenge.There is great music with most characters having one or more theme .there is never a boring moment.a must watch.",

    This was one of the very first anime I watched as a kid, so my review may be slightly biased.\
Lets begin by saying Dbz creates not only a world but an entire universe with various vibrant and unique species to discover.\
I'll be bold in stating that there is nothing else like this out there! if you haven't already, this is a must for any anime fan.\
With Villains hell-bent on destroying the world or just attempting to prove that they're strongest beings in the universe, the story is rather simplistic with no real twists and turns, just straight up  action, adventure and minute elements of\
          \
        a thriller. \
However the character development, the fun and at times brutal nature of the fight sequences will have you engrossed. \
Only real downsides i can think of, are; the prolonged screaming competitions they seem to have, the over the top grunts, the childish humour (minimal) and the episodes you have to sit through where nothing of note happens.\
But overall this is what began my journey into the world of anime, so i think it was Amazing and still is!\
So Check it out!!!\

    Oh boy here we go. Before you look at my score and get upset let me say I would rate the show from Saiyan Saga to the end of the Frieza saga a 9/10. Its the rest of it that really drags out and destroys the good rating for me. The characters are absolutely fantastic, but some go incredibly misused. \
It falls into the problem of every saga playing out the same way. New enemy is the strongest of all time, Goku is off training or absent, everybody tries there best to hold off the threat, lots of training followed by lots of fights, Vegeta\
          \
        gets smashed for being arrogant, and Goku comes stronger than ever to save the day. \
I'd go as far as to say I liked the Android saga but again, misused characters and Frieza being used as a device to show how strong Trunks is. A character who does absolutely nothing relevant after that moment. Then Vegeta goes Super Saiyan, and he does what? Right, his arrogance gets the best of him. \
And the worst of everything would be the majin buu saga, an incoherent mess that wastes way too much time showing the kids and Gohan training all for them to end up losing and Goku and Vegeta having to save the day. Not to mention Fat Buu dragging on way too long as one of the most annoying villains I've ever had to watch. \
Unfortunately I can't give this a good review when half of the show had tacky writing and such awful arcs. I can however say the first half is absolutely fantastic and a real time machine of great 90's anime. Oh and Krillin is awesome too. haha\

    Dragonball Z is probably the only show that when someone says the word \"anime\" I right away think of this show. The story line is phenomenal and highly enjoyable. Got to say not a really good show for young children 2-12years old, that is why DBZ Kai came about, but other than that for teens 13+ it is a boy/man dream come true. \
Goku the most powerful saiyan in the universe fights all evil to protect the innocent. With help of his friends; Krillin, Yamcha, Tien, Trunks, Piccolo, Vegeta, and his son Gohan will fight any evil to protect their home planet Earth. \
Overall this\
          \
        show really made my childhood and I thank anime for that. 10/10\

    There are no doubts, DBZ is perhaps the greatest action anime out there, and it is still running too. The only real negative is it's filler episodes, which there are a lot of, and it really slows down the progress of the story, and can outright hault the action. However, Kai came along and fixed this, not really changing the story, but did remove everything that wasn't needed.\
The story follows several characters, but the most prominent is Goku, who is basically an auto win character. However, the reason why this isn't bad, is because he has to work hard, constantly, to become stronger, and we\
          \
        get a good measurement of power. For instance: A villain comes along, and through great difficulty, Goku wins. This villain shows up a little later, claiming to be much stronger than he was before, but is killed almost immediately by a new character. We now have an established power dynamic, we know this new guy is definitely stronger than Goku. This new guy is later seriously beaten down by a new villain, along with all of Gokus friends again. This new villain is, without a doubt, the strongest of all of the characters. The fix for this is simple, Goku locks himself away for a while and trains the shit out of himself so that he can become strong enough to beat the new villain, and succeeds. But it's knowing that he isn't just that strong that makes him interesting. It's also watching him get to that point.\
It's pacing is also greater than most other anime. Every episode has something new, and the characters are always growing stronger, and learning new things. There is never a moment where the anime becomes stale. It is constantly trying to one up itself.\
I could go on and on about how great the character dynamics are, and so many other things. However, the anime speaks for itself, it is truly something you can't miss.\

Av: Any particular scenes you remember?\
NK: The clash between Vegeta's Gallic Gun and Goku's Kamehameha is definitly my favorite.  I also enjoyed Nappa's death.\
Av: You try watching it in Japanese?\
NK: Dear God, no.  Every time I've tried using the Japanese voices in the DBZ games, I've changed it back to English moments later.  I'm so used to the English voices that the Japanese voices are just...strange.\
Av: Plan on buying any of the series?  You did watch it on TV.\
NK: Eventually.  I really wish to give my support to FUNimation for the series, but it's just so damn expensive for each box set.  When I do, I'll at least get all of the Saiyan Saga.  At most, I'll get all of the series through the Cell Saga.\
Av: Just through the Cell Saga?\
NK: That seems like the more logical ending than the Majin Buu saga.  Too much changes after the Cell Saga.  Plus, everything just comes together with Cell's defeat.  Goku can't be revived again via the Dragon Balls, Gohan finally understands his power, and Vegeta was willing to sacrifice himself so Gohan could finish Cell off.  It just makes sense.\

    I have been a member of MyAnimeList for a few months now, and I've yet to write my first review. I figured now is as good a time as any to start, and what better anime to review than the one of the first I ever watched.\
I'm sure DBZ was a starter anime for many of us here on the site thanks to the likes of Cartoon Network and Toonami and simply hearing the names Goku, Vegeta, and Piccolo is enough to ignite nostalgia within many of us. Therein lies the primary value of Dragon Ball Z, at least for me.\
Dragon Ball Z is a\
          \
        show that knows exactly who it's target audience is, and doesn't strive for anything outside of making twelve year old boys wet their pants in manly glee. At times, the show suffers because of this. The stories seem repetitive and slow, the art is rather mediocre, and the sound is nothing to write home about; but that's not the point of Dragon Ball Z. It's not an artsy anime meant to inspire deep thought, a commentary on the times, or an allegory. If you're looking for those things you won't find them here. What Dragon Ball Z is, is a simple story of good vs evil. It's a story where the good guys beat the beat guys, and you catch yourself cheering for them while they do because the characters, while sometimes silly and simple, are often times endearing enough to make you overlook that. Cheesiness may abound throughout the show, but often you will find yourself taking the bait like a hungry mouse and getting caught in the trap of this show's stories and it's characters' struggles.\
This anime may not change your life or deeply inspire you, but that doesn't make it any less fun to watch. So, if you're looking for something simple with an easy to follow plot that doesn't come with a lot of baggage and doesn't expect you to analyze it's underlying themes, then you've found the right show; and if the show holds nostalgic value then theres no reasoon you shouldn't rewatch it.\
Below, I'll review different aspects of the show a little more in detail.\
Story - 7/10\
The story is, as I said before, not deep or complex. Often times it seems the same ideas are reused over and over. Villain appears. Villain is beaten. Oh, wait! No he isn't! Hero makes sacrifice to beat villain for good. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. The show does use the same ideas a lot but there are enough twists to keep it pretty interesting. The other main complaint I hear made about the story is that half of some episodes are taken up by one character or another grunting, screaming, or otherwise vocalizing in a manly way to \"power up\". This is certainly true and sometimes frustrating, but not frustrating enough to ruin the show. Especially with our modern day Fast-forward technology.\
Art - 6/10\
The art is certainly not going to blow you away in this show. It adequately shows what needs to be shown and nothing more, though I will say everything does have a nice hand-drawn quality to it which is enjoyable if you're into that sort of thing. The character designs are unique and interesting as well, without being too flashy.\
Sound - 6/10\
The sound is not terrible but, much like the art style, it gets the idea across and nothing more. The character voices (I've only seen the dubbed version) are distinctive and well-acted enough, and every once in a while there is a kick ass metal solo that goes well with the visuals.\
Character - 9/10\
One might saythat the characters are one of the best parts of this show, barring nostalgia. They are endearing and there are enough of them that everybody identifies with someone, but not so many that you can't keep track of them all. Some are funny, perverted, or serious. Some are innocent, some are heroes, and some are unlikely anti-heroes. There may not be a lot of depth to them, but by the end of the show you'll feel like you know them pretty well.\
Enjoyment - 9/10\
There isn't much I could say here that I didn't say in the main body of my review. The value of this show lies in either nostalgia, simplicity, or a combination of both.\
Overall - 8/10\
Sure, there are better anime with better art, better sound, and more depth; but maybe they don't hold the memories that this show does. Watch it and remember, or watch it for the first time; and share it with your younger siblings or your children so one day they can enjoy that nostalgia too.\

    This is a very good anime, one of the first I ever watched. So on that note whoever wrote that it's a knock off of Bleach and Naruto is retarded cause this has been out for almost a decade, I watched this show when I was like 4. So try not to write anymore reviews if you don't what you're talking about, kay? Anyway its very good but also kinda silly if your older, like I said I watched it when i was 4-5 so it was good for me then. Although I probably wouldn't watch the entire series again at this age. The drawings\
          \
        are fairly good but I like the more realistic stuff. Anyway it's just an all around good anime for younger kids, although I know of alot of older kids who still love it to. It's up to the person who watches it to decide if they like it or not but I happen to like it alot :) Thnx for listening to me drag on this whole time :)\

I started getting into Manga and Anime because of DBZ, Me and my friend started playing DBZ: Burst Limit. I then went out and bought the first 3 seasons of the Funimation dub and i'm loving watching my favourite Anime of all time.\

    There's not much to talk about Dragon Ball Z. As a sequel to a very good anime (Dragon Ball, obviously), the Z series was much better than its prequel: dramatically decreased the fan service, added a little more seriousness to the story, enhanced the quality of the plot and got the art a lot better.\
It's also one of the most enjoyable series, with good sound, interesting story, and specially pretty funny and full of action.\
The story is already well known by most people: a good and strong alien that looks like a human lives in the Earth and, with the help of his friends, will\
          \
        fight against powerful villains that just want to rule or destroy the universe. Although it's not a demonstration of the most extreme creativity you'll ever see in a series, it is completely worth seeing. It was innovative in its time, it is still very fun today, and it is, without any doubt, a huge success. \
Specifically talking about the Z series, it is almost impossible for Dragon Ball not to be good. Akira Toriyama, coming with his work in a time in which there weren't so many shonen manga, improved the formula for success. DBZ is remembered by half of the people in the world as one of the most funny things to watch in the youth. And it's usually known by the anime, more than by the manga. \
However, that's exactly the problem: the manga is considered by many as much better than the anime series. And that is because of a simple reason - the amount of filler in the anime is absurd! And not only that: every waiting time in the manga is multiplied by over 9000 seconds in the anime. As people know well, DBZ has the impressive capabilty of runaround. People talking, thinking, remembering, discussing, charging powers, reviving, coming after the villains, running away...\
The Dragon Ball Kai series that was released a few years ago was a chance to erase the mistake by remaking the anime without the fillers. Even though it seems to be not as good as the original anime in some parts, it was a pretty good job. You can now choose between Kai and the original, but what I can say is that, even with the fillers, DBZ is still definitely worth seeing. However, I would recommend the manga, that was really superior in the quality and speed of the story.\

Each character in Dragon Ball is enriched with liking towards a particular element...BUT each character additionally has some space to grow and switch between his less predominant characteristics. Indeed, even Yajirobē had its sensational minutes, and Piccolo had its comedic ones\

    Dragon Ball Z is such a great show. The story, visuals and soundtrack makes this anime so good for its time. After watching every single episode and the movies this is definitely a 10/10 for me. I've never came close to watching something as long as this but it was worth it, It was a long show but after finishing it all I wanted is more. I'd recommend this show to anyone who enjoys Shounen and fighting sort of anime.\
Now let me tell you the cons, this show is riddled with filler episodes and such. Some of the time it is bearable but then it\
          \
        gets annoying when you just want it to cut to the chase. I know the remake Kai cuts this out but even then the filler is a bit over the top. I think some of it could of been a bit faster. Also, I find it a bit crazy how many times some of the characters died and got revived.\

The story of Goku and his friends is just fascinating. The tale is filled with so many powerful villains and the characters really have to push themselves to win the battle. I do admit that some scenes were prolonged and could have been cut down in length, but other than that, the story was fabulous.\

Though there are alot of fillers, but other then that the series is great the characters are well developed, the story is great, and the bad guys are bad ass.

    Hello, MAL users. :3 This is my first anime review and I'm little nervous so don't be too critical of me.\
    Dragon Ball Z has to be one of my favorite anime that I have watched. The humor, the writing, and the fight scenes are all beautifully done. It's near perfection. The reason I say it's near perfection and not perfection is because of main flaw. Some episodes drag on for way too long. This is such a valid criticism that they had to make a shorter, HD remastered version named Dragon Ball Kai. Unfortunately, Dragon Ball Kai stopped at the Cell\
          \
        saga so I will not even bother with it. In Retrospect, Dragon Ball Z is amazing and a must watch.\

I recommend DBZ to anyone that is looking for over the top battles, a story that is at the very least interesting enough to keep you entertained and with well-written characters with great development overtime. If you want a good anime adaption of the last 4 arc Dragon Ball manga, I recommend watching Kai 2009 over Z. Kai had much better pacing and it cut out most of the filler plus the 2009 version didn't have the Buu arc which was the weakest arc in the Dragon Ball manga and not including that arc overall improved the anime. \
If you watch Dragon Ball Z instead\
          \
        of Kai, watch Z subbed. The DBZ's English dub is bad. Characters personalities were changed for the worst, The dialogue was far more mature in the Japanese version of Z. and the dub completely killed or undermined the development of some characters. The English dub is overall not good at all compared to the sub\
I give Dragon Ball Z a 7/10 because the pacing and filler were just awful after the Saiyan arc, plus Z does have the Buu arc. DB Kai is a much better adaption of the manga and it's the version I recommend.",

The saga that I love most is the saga of Cell, because it has an interesting history, interesting characters and even are also fun, good storyline, good music, magnificent fights and good drama, the story that caught my attention is Trunks Of the future, since he had a hard life fighting for his life to defeat the androids, and what became sadder is when his teacher, Gohan's future bone has been killed by the androids, so I'm not talking about the Present but in the timeline of Trunks, ose the alternative future, but when Trunks of the future came to the past 20 years before, he fought against Frieza and King Cold, although he became a Super Saiyan, 3 hours later Goku arrives to the ground, and Trunks takes Goku to a safe place to talk in private, when Trunks tells him what had happened in the future and hands the medicine to Goku for the 3 year old heart virus Then, after that, Trunks goes back to the time machine to return to his timeline.\
For characters in the saga of Cell, I like the androids 17 and 18, they are very great, since they have good looks, like that 17 is very handsome and 18 is very pretty, I like his way of fighting and also his techniques, but In the timeline of Trunks, there they work as a team between brothers, they have fought against Gohan and Trunks, but also after Gohan's death, they fought with Trunks, well, I like the androids of the present and future, bone , The two are very good, every time I see them, I am happy to the bottom.\
I also like other sagas, such as Frieza, Majin Boo and Saiyajin saga, were also good, although the saga of Frieza and Majin Boo I like both, but I really stick with the saga of Cell.\
And for this reason, it is my favorite anime.\

    Note: This review was written on my Review Book on Wattpad. If you are interested, don't be shy to check it out! (Link's in my bio)\
So, recently after I finished Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, I thought Dragon Ball Z Kai, or DBZ  for short, was another anime that seemed interesting to me, so I started to watch that one as well. But, like I said about Naruto, when I go back to the anime, it just doesn't do much for me anymore. I don't know why, but that's just how I am. So, maybe before, when I had just finished the anime, I would've\
          \
        given it something like an 8, but I have a feeling I might rate DBZ a 5 or 6, just like Naruto. \
\
So, without further ado, lets get started!\
\
WARNING! THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!\
\
Story: 8/10\
\
Ok, so like I said with Naruto, I really liked DBZ when I first watched it, but sadly, when I try going back to it, it just doesnt do the sane for me anymore. Im not saying that the story is bad, I liked it a lot to be precise. And yes, just like every other anime, DBZ has its flaws.\
First off, battles are veeeeeery long. And I have to admit, some of them are enjoyable, if you're in that kind of thing. But if you cant get online to watch the series, and it comes on Television once a week, some battles can last weeks, months even. Sure, I love my share of extremely long animes, but without internet to binge watch the series, it took me forever to finish the series. Like what Im trying to get at is I really liked the story, its just the length and my capabilities to the internet at the time proved that lots of anticipation was found as I watched the anime. Sometimes that would be a good thing, and others it wouldnt, mainly because excitement would come for Saturdays, and other times i would be groaning in agony because Saturday was almost a whole week away, and I had to go through a full school week just to see one episode. Sometimes it would be very annoying, until I had recieved internet acess. After that, I sped through the anime way quicker, and Dragon Ball Z Kai became my 2nd completed anime. If I had given this series a review as soon as I finished it, I might have given it a 9 or 10 over all, but seeing that it doesnt do much for me as it did before, so this section i decided to give an 8.\
Art: 8/10\
Another 8/10 goes to the art. Now I have to admit, the art for this series is very simple and original. Unlike most animes that feature a lot of male characters, and plenty of references for the style of art in male characters, such as Free!, Naruto, and Daily Lives of High School Boys, never have I seen an anime that has such a fun and simple design to it. Unlike most animes, Dragon Ball Z Kai has a simple eye style, that usually conist of a single black pupil in a simple eye shape, like an arch, or oval shape, such as Goku and Nappa, while others do not have any white area to their pupils, such as Krillin. Some characters, like Bulma, have shinier eyes, which include a colored Iris, black pupil, and highlights and reflections to make the eye style more anime-like and cuter.\
I actually liked the anime style a LOT. Its very unique and cute, a great change-up in art style, especially if youre looking for a change-up in your art style for once.\
Sound: 9/10\
To be honest, I really loved the soundtrack to Dragon Ball Z, it was a lot different than other soundtracks that Ive heard in the past (and future of course), that had a very lively tone to it. I mean theres not much to say about it that was bad about it, I enjoyed it a lot, and that's saying something, since when i go back to the series and im not enjoying it as i did before.\
Characters: 7/10\
Dragon Ball Z's character cast is pretty original, yet, even when watching it for the first time, I never really got attached to any of them, which is strange, since you usually have at least have one character you get attached to in an anime. I mean, you have your different species characters and plenty of little animals and creatures that are allies to the main character, Goku. And a plus to the character cast is that a good amount of characters can put up a fight, so if you really lile strong characters that take weeks for a fight to finish, this is an anime for you. There arent that many flaws on the series, except, like I mentioned before, I just didn't get attached to a character in the series, and Im not sure why. So, i believe this section deserves a 7/10.\
Enjoyment/General: 6/10\
So, another anime that I try going back to enjoy, that fails. I mean, I might've given it a 7 or 8, but, trying to rewatch now a days, it... Just doesnt do the same for me as it did the first time around. I mean, i really enjoyed it a few years ago, but I kind of lost interest when i tried to rewatch it, it just didnt do the same for me. So in general, I think i enjoyed this anime a 6/10.\

    Dragon ball z is a great series if you are trying to pass time. It is long, and on top of the 291 eps you have 14 movies, 153 episodes of the series before it (dragon ball) 4 movies for that series, and 64 eps of the series after dbz (dbgt) which has 1 movie. However if you are a fan of more story and relating to the characters, as well as strong emotion, i wouldn't recommend this anime. This anime is good for the effects, as well as the fight scenes, but even then i find that there are animes that have similar traits\
          \
        to dbz that are much better overall. If you are looking for something just watch and enjoy occasionally for amusement i would recommend watching it, but if you are looking for something with an enjoyable story, that still has some action, I would recommend either Baccano, Fullmetal alchemist: brotherhood, and Phantom: Requiem for the phantom. overall i enjoyed those series much much more then any of the dragon ball series. Still it is a fun show to watch.\

    The show that started the anime crazy on our shores is still after over 10 years fun to watch so let me dive into this anime and tell you what i think.  Toriyama is a man who can create a vivid world and can make the viewers want to be involved with the going ons of the characters he made, the characters and conflicts that they go through seem even more meaningfull because it is so well writtin. Sprawling over 200 episodes you never feel like your watching the same ol thing because it is kept fresh with new characters and great situations that\
          \
        each character has to go through my only few complaints is the cheesy lines that somtimes pop up and the sound is a lil off par givin that at the time sound was an issue because it was so new and different noyone cared . Other than that i think this is one of the better shows out there in the anime world and deserves alot more cred then what it's been getting these past few years so check it out you'll be glad you did.",

    I just have to review this one. My favourite anime of ALL TIME!!\
I think the main reason that made me love DragonBallZ was the epic fighting and transformation sequences. The way some battles turn out is a little predictable but even so, whenever I saw Goku raise his hands to form a Genki-Dama, I also raised mine. and I'm sure most of you also did it.\
Despite the predictable outcome of most battles and the over-usage of the DragonBalls so that no one would die except for the bad guys, after 20 years of existence, it still is a world-wide phenomenom.\
Thank you, Akira Toryama\

    Soo, it's time to open Pandora's box, huh? Well let's get going then, it'll be a long day. \
To be fair, I loved DBZ when I was a kid. The epic fights of musclemonsters clashing onto each other, always accelerating, always getting more powerful was something I dreamed of achieving aswell. I remember standing in the garden screaming my lunges out wishing to become a supersayan who protects the earth from evildoers. But as I rewatched the whole series whith my ex-girlfriend recently, I kind of did not understand why I liked this anime so much back in the days. And that's why I decided\
          \
        to write a review of one of the most popular shows of all time: Dragonball Z.\
\
Story:\
It's always a problem explaining the story of a long running show such as DBZ, but I'll try to do my best to do it justice:\
DBZ is the continuation of Dragonball that revolves around \"The Z-Crew\"( Or whatever the fans call the group of people starring this anime) and their efforts to protect not only earth as in previous instances but also the whole universe. It is divided into multiple arcs which can also be divided into multiple sagas.\
The first one here is the \"Sayan Arc\" which sets stone for the plot of the enxt few(hundred) episodes. Goku here learns that he is not in fact a human but a sayan, a powerful race of warriors that work as mercenaries. Within this arc, Goku meets multiple other sayans, the first one ebing Raditz, his brother. Goku learns that it was originally his mission to conquer earth and Raditz tries to persuade him to do so. Raditz abducts Goku's son Gohan (Hehe, I like my choice of words here...you know...because Gohan's full name is Son Gohan and stuff.....shut up that was funny!) and it ends in Songoku and piccolo teaming up to kill Raditz, which ultimately results in Goku dying but taking Raditz with him. \
Shortly after, Goku is revived with the help of the Dragonballs to fight other sayans who came to check on Raditz, one being Vegeta one of the main characters. they fight each other, Goku wins and vegeta manages to excape from earth. This marks the end of the Sayan arc.\
It is basically just initiating the much bigger \"Frieza Arc\" where we learn a lot more about sayans and a lot of other races in the universe.\
I don't intent to spoil to much but this is important which is  why I will only say this: over the course of the Frieza Arc, Goku achieves a whole new powerlevel, the supersayan, a much stronger, rage driven form of the sayans which only can be achieved by people with a pure heart.\
If anyone who has not actually seen a supersayan before or has not watched DBZ before then I wasnt to apologize at this point for spoiling that. It was necessary for a later point in this review.\
Comment: The DBZ storyline (just like most shonen anime) is not really the factor of relevance here. It's merely there to give the characters a reason to fight and nothing else. Anyone who says that DBZ has a really deep storyline is eitehr lying to you or just (I apologize in advance) stupid. But that is not a bad thing since the focus of this show does not and should not be on the storyline itself but the characters and most importantly the fights. But even in shonen standarts, DBZ's storyline is a little poor. \
Let's take for example Naruto( which I absolutely hate by the way) a show about a young ninja trying to fullfill his dream of being Hokage so that people recognize him while chasing his best friend into the depths of hell. \
It's not a masterpiece but the idea behind it is not half bad. DBZ on the otehr hand is an anime about people fighting aliens, aliens fighting aliens and people fighting *SPOILERS*. And not much else. \
I am sorry but that is a fact.\
Rating: 6/10, simply average.\
\
Art: \
With old anime, you always hove to put it in relation with other old anime. For todays standarts, the early episodes of DBZ look less than average, though they become betterlooking over the course of the anime(Well to be fair, DBZ ran like seven years). Though there are some anime that don't look any better today *cough* Kill La Kill *cough*. \
But for that time, whoa, that anime looked good. Seriously. Look how bad \"Captain Tsubasa\" or that piece of shit \"Big Wars\" were and then look at DBZ and your eyes will be enlightened. My only problem with the art style is within fights late in the series when they decided it would be a great idea to let the fighters turn invisible because of their speed and only show shockwaves in the air where they clash. That is seriously boring to watch because there is no action at all. You simply watch a blue sky with a poof here and there. \
The complete contrast to that is the moment when the sayans turn into supersayans. You literally feel the tension when sparks pulsate from their bodies and the ground beneath them cracks. That is seriously fucking awesome.\
Rating: Considering the age of this anime, I thought an 8/10 would be fair.\
\
Sound: \
The sound is nething shorter than amazing. The soundtrack is, even if it's simplistic, pretty damn awesome. It's all orchestral pieces and they fit the situations prefectly. I still hear them ringing in my head from time to time.\
The effect sounds seem powerful, especially the ones used for the Kamehameha and the other Ki-attacks.you really feel the force that is put behind them. Combine that with the authentic screams of the outstanding voiceactors and you have the perfect mixture for an anime as DBZ.\
\
Rating: 9/10\
\
Character:\
Remember what the two most important things in a shonen are? I'll give you a hint: the characters and the battles. We've already established that the battles look and sound pretty damn good, what about the characters then? Are they any good? HELL NO! For the most part that is. 90% of the old cast hast turned completely useless, with only a few moments where they shine , most of which are only triggers for the sayans to go on rampage or situations where they hold up the enemy for a few seconds.\
The only secondary character that actually stands out a little is Krillin since he's always there as a mental support for Goku and he'S kind of teh comic relief character. He's also the strongest human on earth btw.\
But anyone else beside him is completely useless and only has about 5 minutes of screentime over the course of two episodes.\
But teh biggest problem is that the maincharacters are also not really inspired.  The villains always want world/universe domination, showing barely any difference in character aside from Boo/Buu.\
The main protagonists are what saves this show. Piccolo, Vegeta, Son Goten, Trunks - All of them are outstanding characters that are unique in their own way (I mean, how often do you see a male Tsundere such as Piccolo? :D).\
But there is this one character that goes through now characterdevelopment at all, even though he's kind of the most important one. The one I'm talking about is of course Goku. He's such a blatant and boring character with no special charactertrait at all aside from being a nice guy. I am so sick of these always hungry super nice but totally overpowered maincharacters. God damnit!\
Rating: 5/10, because those few really save this anime.\
\
Enjoyment:\
\
As I have stated before, I really did not enjoy DBZ the last time I watched it. I'm not sure why, maybe I just grew out of it or something, or maybe I'm just sick of people who don't know anything about anime saying \"DBZ is the best anime ever\". Of course it's nostalgic and stuff, but I won't alter my rating because I loved it back then. I enjoyed DBZ a lot as a kid and I don't anymore, that's why I'm giving DBZ a....\
Rating: ....6/10 for enjoyment, because Piccolo is awesome. But there's just not enough depth for me anymore.\
\
Overall:\
This results in a 6.8/10. I know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this, but I don't think DBZ deserves special treatment out of nostalgia or anything. And even with nostalgiabonus: This anime does not deserve a 9 or 10/10. I have seen a lot of reviews here giving DBZ a 10/10 which is insulting to shows that deserve such a high rating such as Gintama and FMA. \
Toastyy out.\

    I'm a former fan who grew up being majorly obsessed with dbz so here's my nice, honest review.\
Story- Story involves the main character Goku and his friends protecting the earth from bad guys thats invade and are in search of the dragon balls.The plot is nothing to write about,it works,all in all it's just so-so with no real great plot twists or shocking reveals that will blow your mind or make you think deepy about the plot.With that said,the plot immediately goes downhill after the frieza arc,every later arcs are just a literal repeat.The format tends to goes like this. Bad guy invades earth,heroes have\
          \
        to train and get stronger,use dragon balls to fix the after math of said villiaem distinctive enough like their powers for example. Certain arcs would have ended faster if said character just did what he was suppose to solve the situation but no we don't get that.Plot scores a 8 at the end of the frieza arc but after watching the buu arc.I can't give it more than a 6.The plot is just there to bring you the fights.(6/10)\
\
Art- The art is rather low quality,grainy looking but it improves as you get farther into the anime.I find the art style to be generally good but there is inconsistency with the how characters look and or how they're placed on screen at times, I'm disappointed that alot of the designs for the characters  don't have their own exclusive distinctive look to them, physical characteristics look way too similar same unless your a saiyan,namek or a women but there's a high abundance of those so it doesn't really matter especially saiyans. Animation is good but not great or eye gasm inducing.There's alot  of repeated frame motions used for most of the fights and obvious short cuts such as when a character is teleporting or running/fighting at high speeds.Nothing too spectacular here but this should be the reason why you watched the show in the first place.The over the top,explosive,fights(8/10)\
Sound- The Japanese ost is atrocious sounding that being said I do preferr Funimation's Bruce Faulconer soundtrack,I think it's much better suited for dragonballz,the only issue I have with it is the constant playing of music.Not every scene needs music to give off a mood.I give the japanese ost a 5 while faulconer's score a 7.(7/10)\
Characters- There are alot of characters in this anime. We got saiyans,nameks androids,etc.  Naive and pure hearted Goku along with cocky arrogant Vegeta  tend to stick out from my mind from the rest of the cast.A problem I have with the characters because their characteristics tend to be too similar. I often have a problem choosing a favorite character because there's not much variation spread throughout the character's themselves to make them distinctive enough like their powers for example.I'm not very fond of the characters besides goku and vegeta or any of the developement they get(7/10)\
Enjoyment-(7/10) I enjoy this anime alot while I was a kid.It's what got me into anime but unfortunately it wasn't all cracked up to be as I grew older and matured however I will say I enjoyed the anime the most when it was at it's high point(frieza arc).After that the plot drags out excessively using the same formula in past arcs to help resolve the situation with the characters acting stupid and one dimensional.\
\
Overall-(6/10) It's a good anime though I don't think it's suited for all demographics.Regardless,show it to your children and friends.It's a highly influential anime that was of the first in the 90's that exposed children's to anime and became a worldwide appeal.\

    Dragon ball Z is an awesome anime with great characters and fighting scenes. Although the fight scenes were long it was worth it, i didn't grow up with it and watch it on TV i watched it on the discs and some on the computer. It was one of my first anime's to watch and it will always be my favorite out of all of the anime i'v watched. I recommend Dragon ball Z to any one who loves action anime.   \

    Dragonball Z could have been one of the best if they hadn't stretched everything out so much.\
TFS Dragonball Z Abridged overall rating: 9.5/10 No complaints.\
Breakdown time!\
Story: Plenty of stuff happens, with plenty of character arcs. One of the most interesting characters are Vegeta and Piccolo. You might be like, wait, isn't the main character Goku or something? Both Vegeta and Piccolo were on the bad, evil side, and seeing the slow change in their character is nice to see. And like most animes, there are times where something could have happened and the series would have basically been done, but it doesn't bother me much\
          \
        because they often happen because of the imperfections of each of the characters. My favourite is actually Gohan.\
  The downside is the draaaaaag. Unless you watch an abridged version the characters are spending so much time narrating and standing there that everything seems boring and flat.\
Art: It's sometimes lazy, but when stuff happens it's really entertaining to watch. Older style, but no complaints from me. I don't like the super high contrast styles in the new animes, but even so, as far as the type of anime art it falls under, they did well. Great\
Sound: The characters all sounded unique and the only issue comes from the dragging of the story. Take the same voices and put them in a condensed version of the show and suddenly no one sounds monologue, and the sounds don't sound cheap.\
Characters: Easily the best part of the show. Lots of maturity of a lot of the characters, noteworthy ones are Goku and Gohan. Goku is an idiot who basically loves food and punching things. He has to deal with friends dying and some people who he is forced to kill. Gohan is his son and has to not only grow up fast, but learn all of those exact same realities for himself at the same time. Unfortunately he also sometimes suffers from Gokus stupidity.\
Enjoyment: Great. I've watched it twice, the not abridged version. The Abridged version however is an absolute joy to watch, from references to the normal show to current pop culture references.\
Overall: It's great, and once again, the abridged version is amazing. Watch Cooler's Revenge (abridged) if you want a good example of what to expect.\

    I have mixed feelings for this anime. Dragon Ball Z was the first anime i watched growing up as a child and I loved it, but re-watching it was a dissappointment. However! I will say this I highly respect Dragon Ball Z for it was the gateway for Anime for viewers not only in America, but the world.\
The plot is self-contradicting, repetive and extremely lengthy. There are many episodes where it is simply a stare down and many of the fights are lengthy and lack depth. However there is thrill when the enemy is knocked out. \
Goku's voice in English is actually more enjoyable than\
          \
        the original - which is highly dissappointing. The rest of the cast changes and grows, but overall lacks depth. However the brotherly love that united Goku and Vegeta is something extraordinary and adds much depth to the anime. Each character relates to each other and actually forms a sort of family which creates depth to each and every character. They each build upon each other striving to become stronger than the other - a sort of healthy competition. \
The animition given the date was standard and at times impressive as well as the OD and ED.\
Overall I will never forget Dragon Ball Z it has brought anime to America and is renknown around the world and I have high respect for Dragon Ball Z as many of the mangaka authors of Naruto, One Piece and Bleach found there inspiration reading Dragon Ball manga.\

    Interesting anime that I saw when I was really young. Lots of action, graphics could use a little more work but nevertheless very entertaining. It's never failed to disappoint me in the area of character developing, always something new.\
But there were just a couple things that bothered me about DBZ..\
The powering up time period is slightly too long for my taste, shouting 'Ahh!! Ohhh! Ahhh!' for 4 episode is what I would call wasting time. \
The outfits, the outfits, creative and suits the characters as well as their setting but what are they made of?.. Every time you see Goku getting beaten half to death,\
          \
        everything on him is ripped, he's heavily wounded, he can barely stand.. but the pants! the pants never comes off, they get torn yes, but never comes off like the other clothing the characters wear.\
No eye brows on the characters as the anime approaches super saiyan 3. That includes the villians.\
The saiyans went from asian to caucasian when they power up. Hm.. \
Lastly, when Piccolo was training Gohan and Gohan turned into the giant monkey after he saw the full moon. Instead of cutting off Gohan's tail, Piccolo took out the moon, tell me that wasn't stupid.\

    To be fair, I will say DBZ was a childhood favorite. However, that was back when seeing screaming and macho fighting was enough to satisfy a kid's heart.\
The storyline is rather weak though, especially with the filler clogging it up.\
\
Speaking of which\
The FILLER IS HORRIFIC.\
The occasional plot twists aren't exactly suspenseful\
The worst part is how fights get stall to the point where the antagonists often can make a comeback with some tactical plotting.\
Also, the dumb decisions made by the heroes lead to the villains living longer and getting stronger than necessary. Sometimes it really makes you think would you actually trust these men to save\
          \
        the world?\
A more subtle issue is consistency of power levels. While it makes sense that the characters are getting stronger, the power of the attacks hitting a threshold and then resetting does not. A Kamehameha wave, a  popular move in the anime, fluctuates in power over the course of the story even when the same character is using it. What could once destroy a hill can the destroy a whole city then a planet then back to just a mountain. \
Holding back that power would only reinforce my point earlier of stalling out a fight.\
At the end of the day, \
the action is still amazing. It's an anime worthy a try albeit skipping all the filler. In fact, I suggest you try Dragon Ball Z Kai, a new, improved filler free version of the original.\

    At this point you've probably already seen or at least heard of Dragon Ball Z, this review is for those who've already know a good deal about it but I'll keep spoilers to a minimum.\
TL;DR will be at the bottom.\
Story - 6\
For a lot of people, including myself, DBZ was our first anime and so with that comes a lot of nostalgia that is put into a lot of these reviews. When you strip away the nostalgia, you find they had one major issue the plagued the majority of the show.\
This show is about 75% fight scenes which in itself is not an issue, but\
          \
        what Dragon Ball Z has that's unique is the Dragon Balls which acts as a way to keep every character in the show no matter what happens to them. It's a plot device that removed all form of consequence, if any of your characters die, bring them back with dragon balls. \
While a lot of shows in this genre have no death scenes and a feeling of safety to them, they still have an option to kill off a character if they wanted to. In Dragon Ball Z, there's a lot of death scenes to them, but we're always aware that just because they're dead, doesn't mean they won't be back next episode alive and well.\
Having a show founded upon fight scenes, even having the record for longest anime fight scene and then removing all forms of consequence, it worsens the story entirely, when we know that nothing that happens in the majority of the show has any affect on the show itself, it quickly loses it's appeal.\
The story lines themselves are fine, evil non-human creatures want to kill Goku and the other main characters. Rinse and repeat, fairly standard for shounen anime so nothing against that when comparing it to the genre.\
Art - 6\
The art's aged and it isn't vintage, it's just old, it faces similar problems as other shows from that time. While it was good at it's time, putting it up against some stuff just a couple years ahead of it shows how old it is. The art itself isn't bad in itself, in fact the character designs are still remembered quite fondly, but like I've said, it's old and quite apparently so.\
Sound - 8\
The sound effects and voice acting are both great, unlike the art it really hasn't aged, the music is alright, a lot of scenes in the show would improve from a different song choice or no music. The music isn't bad but it can often take away from an intense scene, which is better without, but no real critiques.\
Character - 9\
The truest strong suit of DBZ is their characters, a lot of shonens took things from DBZ, the best of those being the characters.  If you're going to remove all consequence from a show about fight scenes, you have to have something to keep peoples interest and that something is the characters. \
This show converts villains to heroes in a way that doesn't feel forced but in  a way that no one watching the show goes \"Wait a second, didn't I just hate this guy 5 episodes ago?\" which in itself may be Dragon Ball Z's most redeemable factor.\
The differing personalities are what truly highlight how special each characters are, you don't have 5 different characters all acting like the same one. Then what they do that's unique is while having all these different people from all walks of life, it still seems logical for them all to want to fight together and risk their lives to same earth.\
Enjoyment - 8\
Despite the constant and never ending fights, while the show does get quite boring if you constantly watch it, I enjoy it quite a bit. I may be talking out of nostalgia so I don't know how fair this is to rate since I can't even trust the enjoyment factor isn't based on solely nostalgia.\
Overall - 7\
This show is a good watch, I don't know if I'd recommend it to many, but it's enjoyable. It's good to watch if only just to see what a lot of anime you've probably seen got a few of their character or plot devices from.  \
TL;DR - It's an okay show that's been overhyped, it's chalked full of fight scenes that lose their appeal due to plot devices, while the art has aged and the OST can sometimes be off, the characters steal the show and make the whole show worth a watch.\

Dragon Ball Z Is Epic..\
but in DBZ the characters have grown and the maturity is felt throughout the whole series, If you're like me, the name Dragon Ball Z gets your blood boiling, Here is my review..\
Characters - 10\
Like I said about the main issue I had from before with its story was just the lack of some of the character progression from the original series dragon ball who are mainly on the sideline for the most part and ironically at the same time other characters are really amazingly well\
          \
        written including Vegeta, Gohan, krillin, Trunks, and Piccolo not to mention goku and vegeta who have one of the best rivalries in the shounen genre. even some of the villains like Cell, and Frieza etc are done amazingly well.\
Sure most of the characters are stereotypes here and there but they are of course shonen characters at the end of the day so what do you expect, it is a battle shounen is it not?\
The Characters are easily the main driving force of the show and can easily get the blood boiling and muscles pumped up when it goes to the extreme almost bringing out an inner fighter in you especially when watching it. The characters have some really good interactions with one another and can easily make you have a personal attachment to 1 of them in some way in terms of their personality.\

    If you are a fan of Shounen anime, then I think it is safe to assume that you have probably heard of Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball Z is the follow up series to the original Dragon Ball, but even if you have not watched the original, which I recommend you watch, I think you can jump into DBZ with only a little trouble. If you aren't a fan of Shounen anime, than DBZ sure is not going to change your mind. DBZ has its fair share of plot holes, filler than can be a chore to get through, tournament arcs, and all the other\
          \
        standard Shounen fair. If you are looking for a Shounen that bucks the typical Shounen cliches, than I recommend Hunter x Hunter (2011) or My Hero Academia as both are excellent and consistently defys your expectations. \
That being said, if you are a Shounen fan that does't mind a few plot holes or some filler that can drag on sometimes, and loves tournament arcs with lots of fighting, than DBZ could be right up your alley. DBZ does have some animation that holds up pretty well despite it being more than 20 years old, some of the most iconic characters in all of anime, some amazing action, and more bad ass and memorable moments than you can count.\
Also, for me personally, the Dub is a must. It far out shines the original Japanese.\
If youare a fan of action series and don't mind shows that can run hundreds of episodes like One Piece or Yu Yu Hakusho, than DBZ is as classic as it gets. Or you could just watch TeamFourStar's Dragon Ball Z Abridged on Youtube. \

 Piccolo is a fictional character from the Dragon Ball metaseries. He is considered both the son and reincarnation of Demon King Piccolo and was spawned to save himself from certain death at the hands of Son Goku. Like his father, he appears as a tall green humanoid creature with pointy ears; he is later revealed to be part of an alien race known as the Namekians. \
 \
 Piccolo is first consumed with revenge against Goku, and elects to defeat and kill him during the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. After his narrow defeat against Goku, Piccolo is soon forced to form an at first uneasy alliance with Goku and his friends against newer, more dangerous threats like the Saiyans and Freeza. Out of necessity he also takes it upon himself to train Goku's child Son Gohan, forming a bond which is strengthened when he sacrifices himself to save the child's life against Nappa. After his resurrection, he fully joins Goku and the others in their struggles against ever more powerful villains.\
 \
 Piccolo still retains elements of ruthlessness and cockiness, but once he fuses with Kami, all traces of evil and hate disappear, and Piccolo is completely reborn as a pure soul. Piccolo remains a loner, preferring to stand apart from others. He has little to say unless it involves battle, but he normally can still retain his stoic and calm personality in everyday, normal situations. Piccolo has shown to have intelligence, such as when he gathered strength to regenerate his arm after Cell had drained it, or when he elected to kill Babidi since he knew leaving him alive wouldn't solve the problem of Buu. His intelligence is even picked up on Buu, who later absorbs him for his fine brain.\
 \
 Piccolo's character development entails him changing from a villain hell-bent on revenge on Goku and controlling the world to becoming a better person who is capable of caring about other people, like Gohan and Goku. He's also showed some interest in learning about his Namekian heritage, and has a good affinity with kids, as he trained Gohan for a year, helped Goten and Trunks to learn Fusion\
 and is even seen humorously rocking Pan to sleep in <i>Fukkatsu no F</i>. He also acts as a confidant for Dende, who is a younger Namekian and is tasked with watching over Earth (Piccolo is able to impart the wisdom he gained from fusing with Kami, as Kami was the previous placeholder of Dende's current occupation).\

 Originally named Kakarot, Gokuu is born a member of a race of extraterrestrials called the Saiyans. Shortly following his birth, Gokuu is sent from his native planet Vegeta to Earth, for potential selling on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life; Goku was also sent away to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Once he lands on Earth, he is adopted by an old man named Gohan (who is later just called Grandpa Gohan). At first, Goku is very violent as a kid due to his Saiyan blood, but due to an injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, Gokuu changes to a more tempered, innocent boy. At the start of the series, Gokuu meets Bulma, Yamucha, Oolong, and Pu'ar, whose characters mirror those found in Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West. He also encounters Kuririn, who eventually becomes his best friend, and others during his journey for more strength. Participating in several World Martial Arts Tournaments, Gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as Tenshinhan and Chaozu, as well as the offspring of Demon King Piccolo named Majunior (later, he's named just Piccolo).\
 \
 Dragon Ball Z takes place 5 years after Gokuu's victory against Piccolo in the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. He now has a son named Son Gohan (named after Grandpa Gohan) who lacks his father's love of fighting but has a great hidden potential himself. Throughout the series, Gokuu & Gohan face terribly strong opponents like other powerful Saiyans, a space tyrant, artificial humans, Majins & Gods that threaten Earth while also giving them exhilarating fights. Along with new enemies, they also gain new friends that help in these situations. As well as becoming more powerful, Gokuu learns to accept his forgotten Saiyan heritage (this gives him a small identity crisis when Raditz reveals his past, and is something he carries with him into the proceeding Namek arc) & consistently comes across the predicament of killing an opponent (he starts out killing without much thought to the moral consequences of taking a life, and only after training under Kami does he start to struggle with killing a person; this comes to a head when he fights Freeza on Namek).\
 \
 In <i>Dragon Ball GT</i>, which is not based on Toriyama's manga, Gokuu is turned into a child by Pilaf via the Black-Star Dragon Balls. The series revolves around him traveling around space to find the Black Star Dragon Balls with the help of his granddaughter Pan and Trunks. After collecting the spheres, Gokuu does battle with Baby (a Tuffle who wants revenge on all Saiyans for killing his race), Super 17 (a powered-up version of former enemy Artificial Human 17) and various Evil Dragons (the physical constructs of negative energy accumulated in the Dragon Balls; they are called Shadow Dragons in FUNimation's dub). The series ends with Gokuu leaving for good with Shenron and returning 100 years later to witness the match between Gokuu Jr. and Vegeta Jr.\
 \
 In <i>Dragon Ball Online</i> (which takes place 216 years after <i>Dragon Ball Z</i>, in which Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story, unlike <i>Dragon Ball GT</i>), a new villain by the name of Miira appears with the goal to obtain Gokuu's DNA.\
 \
 In <i>Cross Epoch</i>, the <i>Dragon Ball</i> and <i>One Piece</i> crossover one-shot, Gokuu is seen accompanying Luffy to attend a party hosted by Shenron from whom key characters from both series had received an invitation.\
 \
 In <i>Dragon Ball Minus</i>, it is revealed that Gokuu was sent away by his mother and father (Gine & Bardock) to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Gokuu leaves Planet Vegeta in his pod with a forlorn look as his parents send him away.\
 \
 Gokuu is known for his laid-back personality and his love of fighting worthy opponents. He will eat anything without much qualms. He has an uncanny ability to make allies out of foes he has fought (in some cases to the death), though his capacity for sparing his enemies has occasionally been criticized as foolish (Gokuu generally only fights to win and improve himself, and spares his enemies after winning only for them to attack him when his back is turned). Gokuu can also be very blunt, and not afraid to express his opinion in a discussion, such as when he questioned Krillin's marriage to Android 18 (who was not fully human and a previous enemy who threatened his life). Despite his kind-hearted nature, Gokuu can feel incredible anger in cases of extreme turmoil, such as the death of a close friend/relative, or when someone murders many innocents needlessly. He has a simple, practical view of the world and is somewhat naive to the world around him. Because of this, many characters incorrectly assume him to be somewhat stupid, although once he has a basic understanding of things, he learns very quickly. His most remarkable ability is his will to succeed, his tenacity and persistence.\
 \
 He's so focused on improving himself as a warrior that some of the decisions he makes are detrimental to the survival of humanity or those who he cares about. Such examples include when he purposefully chose not to help his friends and family when they were attacked by Beerus at Bulma's birthday so as to study his opponent, or when he elected not to destroy Gero's lab in favor of his curiosity at his potential opponents' strength even though it might've meant the destruction of mankind. This is also touched upon when he spares Vegeta for a rematch in the Saiyan arc, despite this also being a threat to humanity. However, he has shown to be able to slightly curb this selfishness, as he elected to not return to life after dying in the fight against Cell so that Earth would not be endangered by the evil people he tends to attract (although, Goku is also interested in fighting the masters in the afterlife indicating some slight selfishness was still apparent). \
 \
 Goku has also admitted to not being good at creating things, and being better at breaking stuff at the end of <i>Dragon Ball Kai</i>. In <i>Dragon Ball Super</i> Ep. 4, Goku is revealed not to be much of a party-goer. He has also shown an affinity with training younger kids (like how he did with Gohan in the Androids arc, Goten & Trunks in the Buu arc, and Uub at the end of the series).\

 Gohan is a main character in the <i>Dragon Ball</i> series by Akira Toriyama and is the dual main character of <i>Dragon Ball Z</i> along with his father, Goku.\
 \
 Gohan is a shy and studious intellectual, and as a child lacks the fighting spirit that is common among most Saiyans. However, because he is forced to protect the ones he loves, he taps into his vast half-breed Saiyan potential, becoming one of the most powerful main characters in the series. As an adult, he abandons his superhero duties and uses his mind, as a premier scholar. Gohan is extremely powerful, sometimes surpassing Gokuu, Piccolo and Vegeta at certain points in the story.\
 \
 At first, the relationship with Piccolo is a frightening one, but after Piccolo saves Gohan's life from Nappa at the cost of his own, Piccolo admits his change because of Gohan's acceptance of him during the 1 year they were training together. From here on out, Piccolo acts as an uncle (oji-san in the Japanese version) to Gohan. Krillin also acted as a strong confidant in Gohan, particularly during the Namek arc and the beginning of the Buu arc.\
 \
 Gohan also shares a strong relationship with his father in Gokuu, citing his walking up to Freeza on Namek as a source of inspiration and strength. He also spends to close to a full year just with him in the Room of Spirit and Time during the Androids arc, and the two really get to enjoy each other's company. Gohan's respect and love for his father is all the more shown when he elects to wear Goku's orange gi when he sets off to fight Buu.\
 \
 His hobbies are reading, fishing, and researching scholarly subjects. Though he claims he does not share the love of fighting Gokuu has, Gohan does feel obligated to help when danger arrives. He also enjoys being a hero, as seen by his comedic and unimpressive Great Saiyaman stunt. Another prominent facet of his personality was the fear of his own great potential power, which was seen when he was afraid that he might kill Cell during their battle in the Androids arc.\

 Vegeta is a fictional character from the manga series Dragon Ball, created by Akira Toriyama.\
 \
 Along with Goku, Gohan and Piccolo, he is one of the most prominent characters in the series, originally starting out as a villain before becoming a mainstay hero.\
 \
 Vegeta starts out haughty, arrogant, self-entitled and ruthless as the prince of Saiyans. His royal status caused him to develop an inflated sense of superiority and he holds himself above most, if not all people he encounters. Regal, egotistical and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless, cold-blooded warrior and outright killer. However, as the story unfolds, he changes to a person capable of caring about and loving someone other than himself.\
 \
 Vegeta was once a young member of the Saiyan army, but after his race's demise, he worked alongside Nappa and Raditz, directly under Freeza. He seeks immortality to rule the universe, but once he learns about Freeza destroying his planet from Dodoria, he resolves to take out Freeza (not to avenge his race, but to assure his own rule over the universe as well as to get back at Freeza for unknowingly using him to further his own goals). He later battles Freeza with the main cast on Namek and dies in the ensuing fights; once he is revived, he returns to Earth, where he adjusts to everyday life and remains there for good.\
 \
 In <i>Cross Epoch</i> (the <i>Dragon Ball</i> and <i>One Piece</i> crossover one-shot) Vegeta is the captain of an air ship and is seen wearing an eye patch and a cape with a clasp featuring the Kanji character for \"vegetable.\" Trunks, Usopp and Nico Robin are members of his crew.\

Babidi's mental abilities are very powerful, surpassing those of various mystical individuals who reside in Other World such as the telepathic North Kaio, and illusionist Princess Snake. After Buu is released, Vegeta nearly kills Babidi when trying to destroy Buu. When Buu is seemingly destroyed, Piccolo bisects Babidi and leaves him for dead. After Buu revives himself, he finds Babidi who then orders Buu to revive him. Babidi orders Buu to kill Dabura, Kaioshin, Gohan, Piccolo, Goten, Trunks, Vegeta (before his sacrifice) and whoever else stands in his way. As Buu is very disobedient, Babidi can only control him by threatening to seal him up. After an encounter with Super Saiyan 3 Goku, Buu learns that he is stronger than Babidi. Realizing this, Buu strangles Babidi (so Babidi can't say the spell to seal him up), and then punches his head off in rebellion. Babidi is seen in hell with Cell and Freeza but wanted the Z fighters to win after having created a grudge against Majin Buu.\

It was only after the film's airing in Japan that he was later shown in two panels of the manga by Akira Toriyama, who helped design the character for Toei Doga's television production. His name is a pun on \"burdock\" (バードック, bādokku?), a herb. While the Viz manga and FUNimation's Japanese-language English-subtitled anime both use \"Burdock\", FUNimation's English anime dubs uses \"Bardock\", and some Japanese merchandise even use \"Barduck\". \
 The biological father of Raditz and Son Goku, Burdock is a Saiyan who is given the gift of precognition. In several of his recurring visions, he witnesses the destruction of his home planet Vegeta by the hand of Freeza. After escaping certain death from Dodoria, he tries desperately to change his planet's grim future by attempting to combat Freeza and his legion of men head on. He ultimately fails on ceasing Freeza's attack on the planet and is killed in the process. Moments before his death, he received a vision of his son facing the warlord. According to the anime special, Burdock was estimated a battle power of 10,000 by observant doctors while recovering from his last mission.  \

 Bulma is originally a secondary main character, but her role is quickly downplayed as the series continues, even though she does remain an important support character for most of the series. Bulma is a direct parody of the character Xuanzang from the Chinese novel Journey to the West. Even though Bulma's character parodies a monk, her Japanese name \"Buruma\" is the brand of a popular gym short worn by girls in Japan. Her re-adapted name Bulma is a direct take on the word \"bloomers\", which was a popular brand of women's underwear in the early 20th century.\
 \
 Bulma is the second character to be introduced in the Dragon Ball series. In the early part of the story, she is the inventor of the Dragon Radar and is searching for the legendary Dragon Balls. Bulma was hoping to use the Dragon Balls to wish for the perfect boyfriend. While searching for a nearby Dragon Ball, she runs into Son Goku. It is at this time that she finds out Goku inherited one of the balls (the four-star ball) she is searching for from his Grandpa Gohan. Because of Goku's love for the ball and his belief that his Grandpa's spirit lives in the ball, Goku is not willing to give it up. Bulma then asks him to loan it for her in exchange of taking him in her travels. At that point, they team up to find the remainder of the balls and the adventure begins. In the later action-oriented episodes of the series, there is little room for a genius but Bulma continues to play a role as a secondary character, helping Goku and his friends with her gadgets, and having a rather rocky relationship with Yamcha.\

It is said by Kuririn that both Butta and Jheese are as strong as Reacoom.  \
 Along with Jheese, Butta sits out the fighting until Gokuu arrives and defeats Reacoom singlehandedly. Butta and Jheese jump in to attack Gokuu, but the Earth Saiyan proves both faster than Butta (much to his fury) and stronger than both of them. He then defeats Butta with two crippling blows to the back, and shortly thereafter, Vegeta finishes Butta off by dropping a knee on and breaking Butta's neck. He and Jheese fought Tenshinhan when they tried to invade North Kaio's planet in an anime filler, only to be defeated. He was once again defeated later by Gokuu.  \

 Chi-Chi (チチ, Chichi) is the wife of Son Goku, and the mother of Son Gohan and Son Goten. She is often depicted as a sometimes nagging, overprotective but fundamentally well-meaning woman, who sincerely looks for her children and husband's well-being even when their views clash. She and Goku meet as children, and Goku promises to marry her thinking marriage is food. Several years later, she finds him at the 23rd Tenkaichi Budoukai, and despite confessing that he misunderstood what she had meant, he fulfills his promise and asks her to marry him. As she gets older, she disapproves of Goku's lifestyle, enough to ban Gohan from following in his foot steps, but due to the threats like Vegeta and Freeza, she is forced to let him train under Piccolo and Goku. She relaxes this with Goten by training him herself while Gohan is away for school. She has a wild temper and can react in violent anger over the slightest annoyance which means all of the Z Warriors fear her and try to avoid making her mad.\

 He fights Gohan in both his normal and Super Saiyan forms to gather energy for Buu, but before they can finish, he notices Vegeta has evil within him. During the fight Vegeta shows great frustration which comes from the fact that Gohan has to make an effort to kill Dabura even though Gohan is still more powerful than Dabura. This spawns from the fact Gohan has not trained at all in the past 7 years and is only slightly more than half as strong as he was when he fought Perfect Cell. This allows Babidi to grant him power. When Buu is released, Dabura tries to kill him, but is turned into a cookie and devoured by Buu. (Upon his death in the anime, King Yamma decides that the usual punishment of exile to Hell is what Dabura would actually desire, so he instead sends him to the most peaceful region of Heaven.) In the anime, Dabura is later seen wandering as a \"good-spirited\" soul consumed with love (creeping out anyone who meets him).\

He then kidnaps them and restructures them into Android 17 and Android 18. However, the two became rebellious as they retain their human free will, so he deactivated them. In Dragon Ball GT, he helped Dr. Myu create Super 17, who later went on to kill both of them.\

      description = "Frieza is a fictional graphic novel supervillain who first appears in the Dragon Ball manga created by Akira Toriyama, followed by Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT. Frieza also appears in the television special Bardock: The Father of Goku; a few Dragon Ball Z movies and in Dragon Ball GT. He is one of the most powerful major supervillains introduced throughout the Dragon Ball universe. In the gag series Neko Majin Z, it is revealed that he has a son, Kuriza. \
 Frieza is introduced in the series as the powerful galactic overlord on a mission for immortality and conquest, ruler of an empire said to control seventy-nine or more planets. Frieza creates armies from the planets that he conquers, his most utilized race were the Saiyans. Frieza had heard about the legend of the Super Saiyan, a being with unrivaled power, but dismissed it as simple mythology; however, after several Saiyans emerged with rapidly evolving potential, Frieza began to fear that the legend would indeed come true, so as a result, destroyed the Saiyan race. His actions and lust for power eventually bring him into conflict with the heroes of the series when he tries to take possession of the wish-granting Dragon Balls on Planet Namek. \
 \
 Frieza's fears were realized when he was defeated by Goku, who in turn had become a Super Saiyan.\
 \
 His character would return shortly thereafter, having survived the encounter with Goku but having been left with multiple metal prosthetics. Though accompanied to Earth by his father, Frieza is unable to avenge his loss, being killed with relative ease by a newcomer to the series, the half-Saiyan time traveler Trunks. A blood sample taken before his ultimate fate would later become a catalyst for the next arc's featured villain: Cell, a warrior genetically engineered to be perfect.\
 \
 After Frieza's death, he was kept imprisoned in Hell, with the Angels of Hell being the ones who were tasked with ensuring that he remained captive. During his time in Hell Frieza retained his Mecha Frieza state and was left trapped inside a cocoon. \
 over 14 years after Frieza's demise, his two elite soldiers Sorbet and Tagoma collect all of the Dragon Balls and resurrect him, and he is revived as he was just before his death, as Mecha Frieza and in pieces. Sorbet and Tagoma collect all of the pieces of Frieza and put the organic parts in a healing chamber, Frieza's body is regenerated and he reverts himself back into his first form.\
 \
 Frieza believes that through four months of serious training, he will be able to reach a level of power high enough to wipe out the Saiyans in the blink of an eye.\
 \
 Toei Animation would continue to make use of the character in their anime adaptation, with Frieza making brief cameo appearances during the Buu Saga, animated features and Dragon Ball GT. He is last referenced in the manga as a measure of the strength of the Kaioshin, the supreme lords of the Dragon Ball universe, as \"each of whom could have felled Frieza in one blow\". In Toriyama's out-of-continuity parody of his earlier work Neko Majin Z, Frieza sends his henchman Vegeta on errand to retrieve his missing son on Earth.\

He is defeated when faced with an angry Gohan, who pushes Garlic Jr. into the Dead Zone, an alternate dimension he can freely open. Though defeated, he later reappears in the Garlic Jr. Saga in the gap between the Freeza and Trunks sagas, and battles once more against the combined efforts of Kuririn, Piccolo, and Son Gohan. He uses his power source, the Makyo-sei, to escape the Dead Zone, and uses the Black Water Mist, which causes those who breathed it in to become mindless demon slaves under his rule. He is stopped after Gohan destroys the Makyo-sei, which drains his power, leaving him trapped in the Dead Zone once again. \
 His resemblance is of a much earlier villain in the series, Pilaf. The two sound and almost look identical to each other, both being cunning villainous dwarves voiced by Chuck Huber and Shigeru Chiba.

 Originally a human, he is constructed into a cyborg by Dr. Gero like his twin sister. 17 is a mass murderer in Future Trunks' timeline.\
 \
 Number 17 is not an android created by Dr. Gero. He and his twin sister #18, were once human. How could they be twins if they weren't once human? Toriyama said Gero found them as a couple of hooligans. They existed before Dr. Gero, therefore, they are not robots. An android is a robot and a cyborg is a human with robot parts in them. Considering what he can do, #17 is probably about half human.\
 \
 Now as to the motivation behind #17 killing Dr. Gero, that's subjective. While they didn't necessarily like being turned into cyborgs, once it was done, it couldn't be undone. It was Dr. Gero's strangle hold on their freedom, as represented by the \"controller\" device, that inspired #17 to kill him. Threat + Rebel = dead Gero. They were both rebels. You should never try to put a leash on a rebel.\
 \
 Later, #17 and #18 drive around in a van with Android 16, looking for Goku. When they finally get to the Kame House, Piccolo tells them Goku is not there. He refuses to tell them where he went to, and thus Piccolo challes #17 to a battle. As they fight, Piccolo's ki leads Cell (an evil insect freak spawned by Dr. Gero's computer who needs to absorb #17 and #18 to reach its perfect form) to the battlefield. He offers #17 to surrender so he can become a part of *greatness*. #17 refuses, and is defeated during the battle.\
 \
 Number 17 is killed when Cell explodes, but is wished back to life along with the other people on Earth who had been killed by Cell. #17 has his explosive device removed by Kuririn with the second wish. The last time we see #17 in DBZ is when he is in the woods donating energy for Goku's Genki-Dama. Considering the fact that he is alive during the Kid Buu saga serves as a testament to his good soul: the wish that revived him was one that Vegeta made asking for only the good people on Earth to be revived when it was restored (Kid Buu had previously obliterated the planet in a single attack).\
 \
 He later returns as one of the ten members of the Universe 7 team in Dragon Ball Super,  and ends up sacrificing himself to hold back Jiren. \

No. 18 is a mass murderer in Future Trunks' timeline. \
 A cybernetic human, #18 modified by Dr. Gero. She is often referred to in the original Japanese as a jinzōningen, which literally translates as \"artificial human\". She is not entirely an android; she refers to both herself and her twin brother as having been \"constructed from a human base\".\
 \
 After Cell is defeated, Kuririn uses the Dragon Balls to wish for #17 and #18 to be turned into humans; Shenlong is unable to perform this task because of the unfathomable differences in power between him and the duo, so he wishes instead for their self destruct devices to be removed. Kuririn pursues #18 and, at some point, they marry and have a daughter named Marron.\
 \
 To clear up the heavily espoused misconception that #18 is a pure android and therefore could not have a child, Kuririn went on to explain to Son Goku during the World Tournament Saga that she was originally human but that Dr. Gero just \"remodeled her a little bit.\"\

He has the ability to absorb people's energy through his hands to give himself the upper hand in combat. \
 In \"Dragon Ball Full Color: Artificial Humans & Cell Arc Volume #03,\" Akira Toriyama revealed that: \"The model for No. 19 was a doll that was displayed in the command center of an enemy base. Way back when, Dr. Gero took it back with him as a war trophy.\"\
 \
 Though not particularly strong, he managed to beat Goku in battle due to the heart virus that he had contracted. 19 almost killed Goku by draining him of his energy, but he was interrupted by Vegeta who proceeded to beat him with little effort. Vegeta then transformed into a Super Saiyan and started taunted him mercilessly and asked him if androids feel fear. After 19 had his energy absorbing hands torn off by Vegeta, he tried to flee in fear only to be vaporized by Vegeta's \"big bang attack\" leaving nothing but his head behind.\
 \
 In Dragon Ball GT, everyone escapes from Hell and Android 19 is among them. He is easily defeated by energy blasts from Son Goten and Trunks, the son of Vegeta.\

He is voiced by Daisuke Gouri in the original Japanese version, Chris Rager in the FUNimation version and by Don Brown in the English version from the UK and Canada. \
 Even though he has never directly saved the world he is highly responsible for defeating Kid Buu as he convinced everyone on earth to give power to Goku's Genki Dama, along with his direct role in defeating Majin Buu. A common point of humor after his first appearance in the Cell Saga is his extremely inflated ego, arrogance and craving for the spotlight which the Z Fighters find annoying at best. Interestingly enough, he never lost any World Tournament that he attended in the series, nor has he died, making him one of the few characters not to have done so along with Pan, his granddaughter. He has a daughter named Videl who dates/marries Son Gohan. A reference to this is made in the video games Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2 and Budokai Tenkaichi 3. If the player matches Adult Son Gohan and Mr. Satan the opening dialogue starts with Mr. Satan saying \"If you want to go out with my daughter, you'll have to go through me!\" Gohan replies, \"Wait, it's not like that!\" The fight then begins.\

He dons white Ancient Greek-style robes with brown suspenders and belt, wears white bands on his wrists and shins, and dons large light brown boots. He also wears an orange headband.\
 \
 King Kai stated that most of Earth's heroic legends are based on Olibu's acts of heroism during his life. It is implied in an anime filler that Korin Tower on Earth could have been built to honor him. \
 \
 After his acts of great heroism during his lifetime, Olibu was granted access to live and train on the Grand Kai's planet. He was working on his 10,000 years of training when Goku meets him in the Other World. During the Other World Tournament, Olibu beats Chapuchai, and later battles but loses to Pikkon in the quarter-finals. \

 Olibu makes a cameo appearance, along with Mijorin and Maraikoh, in the movie Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. \

Kid Buu almost destroys Olibu with the Shocking Ball, but instead decides to fight Goku and Vegeta when he senses their energy.

 Pan is a fictional character in the manga and anime series Dragon Ball Z, as well as Dragon Ball GT. She is a Human-Saiyajin quarter breed. In the original Japanese version, she was voiced by Yuko Minaguchi, while she is voiced by Elise Baughman in the FUNimation dub and by Caitlynne Medrek in the Blue Water Studios redubs. It should be noted that Pan's name comes from the Pan of Roman (as well as others) mythology. That means that, at first glance, she appears to have been named after her mother Videl rather than her father Gohan. However, closer inspection reveals a double-pun on behalf of author Akira Toriyama, in that Pan is also the Japanese and Spanish word for bread, continuing her father's food-based name as well as her mother's god-religion-based name.\
 \
 Pan is introduced in the series following the ten year interval between the defeat of Majin Buu and the end of the written Dragon Ball series. In the series, Pan is daughter of the primary character named Son Gohan, and as a result, the granddaughter of the main character named Son Goku. Pan is the only original character in the series with the most diluted Saiyajin heritage, and as a result, it was stated in the Daizenshuu that she didn't have the ability to become a Super Saiyajin. However, this is later contradicted by the Dragon Ball GT Perfect file books that stated that she could have ascended if she trained hard enough. It was also stated by Toriyama that the simple reason to Pan's inability to become a Super Saiyajin was that he could not come up with a logical design for a female Super Saiyajin; being that most of the Super Saiyajin traits are typical of males, and not females.\
 \
 As Pan only appears for three chapters in the manga, her later life is elaborated on in the anime-only series called Dragon Ball GT, where she is seen as a young girl who travels the galaxy with her grandfather Goku, and Trunks, the half-Saiyajin son of the characters Vegeta and Bulma. In the final episode of Dragon Ball GT, Pan is seen as an old woman, being over 100 years old. She is the grandmother to the character named Son Goku Jr., who has the ability to become a Super Saiyajin. This contridicts the Daizenshuu that stated that characters who possessed less then half-Saiyajin heritage did not have the ability to become Super Saiyajins because of diluted blood-lines.\

Later, it is revealed that he is the evil half and evil twin brother of Kami; the two were once a single entity. Piccolo Daimao's name is based on the instrument of the same name — hence, all of his sons share the names of various musical instruments. While he is named after a flute, the others are named after percussion instruments. \
 Piccolo Daimao came into being some 300 years before the beginning of Dragon Ball sometime after a powerful Namekian on Earth attempted to\
 assume the position of guardian of Earth, he was neglected of the position due to the evil that occulted within. As a result, the Namekian\
 concentrated and trained to relinquish the evil within; which conspired into producing two separate entities — if one should perish, the\
 other would also. The concentrated evil being known as Piccolo Daimao. At first, the name \"Piccolo\" was a reference to the wind instrument,\
 but then a revelation by Mr. Popo to Bulma meant it translated to \"different world\" in Namekian.\
 \
 It remained unknown if Piccolo Daimao knew he was a Namekian, as he was shown to know the language and some of his powers and techniques are\
 of Namekian origin, even replicating Guru's throne. If Piccolo Daimao knew, this could mean that the evil within Kami originated from being\

Traveling alongside Yamcha, the two worked as a team robbing anyone traveling through the desert area in which they lived. Pu'ar has an innate ability of levitation or flight, and is nearly always seen simply 'standing' in thin air at about human head height. \
 Pu'ar has the unique ability to shapeshift into any form, even inanimate objects, and can hold that form for as long as desired; though strength is not increased by the change, however, as such is unable to turn into something that can be used up like fuel or food. Pu'ar graduated from the same shapeshifting academy as Oolong, although unlike Oolong, Pu'ar had completed all of the academy training and does not have Oolong's difficulties with maintaining a transformed state. Pu'ar shows up quite a bit in the beginning, but becomes less of a presence as the series continues. As the driving theme of the series is mostly about fighting, Pu'ar can do little more than react to the horrors of the latest supervillains in the story.\
 \
 There is some debate regarding the character's gender. Despite being portrayed by several female voice actors, the character has been referred to with both male and female pronouns during the anime. Though the issue of gender is never directly addressed, Toriyama has referred to Pu'ar as \"he\" while answering a fan question in the \"Ask Me Anything\" section in the back of the manga. Some fans believe that since shape-shifters can assume many different forms, gender is a moot point.\

Shen Long can bestow any wish as long as it does not exceed the power of his creator, who must be still alive (i.e. Kami or Dende). Multiple times in the Dragon Ball series, Shen Long threatens to kill the summoner if they do not say a wish on time, or if they do not say a wish at all. Shen Long cannot bring back a person from the dead more than once. The Dragon Balls cannot be used for 365 Earth days after a wish is made, as they turn to stone. The Earth Dragon Balls are relatively small, each about the size of a large orange, much smaller than the namekian Dragon Balls, which are the size of beach balls.\

 The base for Shen Long is a stone statue kept by his creator. If Shen Long is killed, the Dragon Balls turn to stone. The statue also shatters. If the creator or another Namekian wishes to, they can rebuild the statue to give life back to Shen Long and the Dragon Balls. This happened after Shen Long granted Piccolo Daimao's wish for youth.\

After Dende brought him back to life, he was able to grant two wishes (three if the first does not revive more than one at a time). If the summoner wants, he can only make one wish.

In Dragon Ball GT, he wears a white shirt with purple jeans, and his hair is much shorter. His skin color stays lightly tanned for all of his appearances in Dragon Ball Z/GT. Goten, unlike his brother, was never shown to have a tail. This is never explained.\

He is usually accompanied by Chaozu, his training partner and best friend, whom he can communicate with telepathically. \
 Tien Shinhan has a unique physical composition as a throwback to his ancestors, the Three-Eyed clan. He has the ability to grow arms from his back, split into four people, and he achieved his third eye through deep meditation. During the early years of his life, Tien entered Master Shen's Crane School. There, he learned powerful ki-based techniques such as the Dodon Ray and the Tri-Beam, and he was taught defensive techniques by Master Shen's younger brother, Mercenary Tao.\
 \
 At the time of his introduction, Tenshinhan is among the most powerful warriors in the series, matched only by Goku himself. Heavily devoted to martial arts, reclusive and disciplined, Tien Shinhan is one of the strongest Humans within the Dragon Ball universe. He battles alongside the other Z Fighters when major threats to the Earth surface, often courageously engaging enemies far more powerful than himself.\
 \
 As is the case with a handful of other characters from the early chapters of Dragon Ball, Tenshinhan was inspired by a character from Journey to the West; his unique feature of having a third eye was derived from the Chinese god Erlang Shen.\
 \
 According to the Daizenshuu book 7 and the PlayStation 2 game Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi, Tenshinhan belongs to the alien race of the \"Three-Eyed clan.\"\

 Videl is the daughter of Mr. Satan. Mr. Satan is very protective of her, especially in respect to boys. She grew up learning martial arts hoping to be as great as her dad, when in fact, unknown to herself she was already better than him. She is a tough, tomboyish character, raised with fame all around her. In her spare time, Videl fights crime in Satan City. She becomes suspicious of Gohan after meeting him at Orange Star High School, and she even follows him for a brief time to learn more about him. Videl eventually discovers Gohan's secret identity as the Great Saiyaman. She forces Gohan to teach her how to fly, and makes him enter the 25th Tenka'ichi Budokai under the threat that she'll reveal his identity to the world. After the Buu saga, the two get together, and have a child named Pan.\

This changes, however, with the arrival of a mysterious enemy named Raditz who presents himself as Gokuu's long-lost brother. He reveals that Gokuu is a warrior from the once powerful but now virtually extinct Saiyan race, whose homeworld was completely annihilated. When he was sent to Earth as a baby, Gokuu's sole purpose was to conquer and destroy the planet; but after suffering amnesia from a head injury, his violent and savage nature changed, and instead was raised as a kind and well-mannered boy, now fighting to protect others. With his failed attempt at forcibly recruiting Gokuu as an ally, Raditz warns Gokuu's friends of a new threat that's rapidly approaching Earth—one that could plunge Earth into an intergalactic conflict and cause the heavens themselves to shake. A war will be fought over the seven mystical dragon balls, and only the strongest will survive in Dragon Ball Z. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
