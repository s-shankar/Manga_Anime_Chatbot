They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called \"automail\" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist. Three years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2665, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    First of all, I have seen the original FMA and although it was very popular and original, the pacing and conclusion did not sit too well with me. Brotherhood is meant to be a remake of the original, this time sticking to the manga all the way through, but there were people who thought it would spoil the franchise. That myth should be dispelled, as there's only one word to describe this series - EPIC.\nI admit that as I've seen the original and read the manga, the pacing of Brotherhood seems to start off being VERY fast (I finally got used to the pacing after\n          \n        watching the first fifteen eps or so). Events that took up half a volume of the manga and had spread though a few episodes of the original anime were now shown in just a single episode. However, after trying to look at it from the perspective of someone who's new to FMA (not comparing it to the manga nor the original), I believe that the pacing works and it manages to tell an intriguing story effectively with little confusion. The plot is full of clever ideas and unpredictable twists that link various parts of the story together. By the final episode, all loose ends are neatly tied up and what's left is a hugely satisfying epilogue.\nThe animation in FMA Brotherhood is crisp and very well done (although it does sometimes dip a bit in quality). Compared to the original FMA it's a bit simpler but that's just because the original set a very high standard to follow. The facial emotions of the characters are also perfectly presented. The action scenes are brilliant and VERY well animated, with a variety of alchemy techniques and other talents being displayed nearly every episode. The various battles are consistently exciting to watch, but somehow get even better towards the end of the series.\nThe voice acting is of an excellent and consistent quality, and I think that pretty much all the characters have voice actors which suit their personalities. The majority of the openings/endings are a pleasure to watch due to fantastic animated sequences and theme songs. The background music which play during the episodes usually fit very well with the situation, although some tracks seem to be overused a little at first. This becomes less of a problem as the series progresses, with plenty of new music being introduced to support the story as it reaches the finale.\nMoving on to the characters (best thing about this series), the original FMA focussed mainly on Ed and Al and on their struggles to regain their bodies, whereas Brotherhood also explores other characters to great detail at the same time. The majority of the spotlight is still on the two brothers, but it highlights their interactions with new characters which were not present in the original anime. New characters include a group of people from Xing (a neighbouring country), another person from the Armstrong family (who I think has become one of the coolest members of the supporting cast), and a new main antagonist. For me, the Xingese characters in particular (Ling Yao and Mei Chang among others) provide a new dimension to the FMA world, by showing us a different culture to the militaristic one we're familiar with. I think the new antagonist is an improvement on the original FMA, as this person has a much stronger and clever link to the Elric brothers' father. Returning characters from the original FMA, such as Mustang and Scar, are much more awesome and developed due to the fact that Brotherhood is 100% faithful to the manga. Plus, Winry Rockbell now has a much more active role in the story. I can say for sure that this anime has one of the best main/supporting casts I've ever seen, and you'd probably find it difficult to label any of the recurring characters (whether they are good or evil) as being either boring or unnecessary in terms of the storyline.\nOne of the many good things about this series is that there has been absolutely no filler at all (yes, I'm thinking of Naruto, Inuyasha, etc), which prevents the story from losing momentum. All the episodes are concise and every scene is important as part of the huge plot. The dialogue fully explains everything and is straight to the point. As multiple characters are explored there are lots of side stories, but these are all perfectly intertwined with the main story of the Elric brothers and more often than not directly influence their journey too. Like most anime series, there are things from the manga which have been left out, but these are usually just restricted to comedy moments. There has been one episode which shows a lot of flashbacks of events so far, but that's forgiven as it shows the most epic moments of the series, and also provided us with some history on the father of the Elric brothers. \nFMA Brotherhood will be sorely missed now that it's finished. It is excellent in every aspect and has very little, if anything, that can be called a flaw (maybe rushed character development at first due to the fast pacing, but this quickly subsides). Each episode feels like it's too short, a testimony to how much it draws you in to the story and characters. There are moments which leave you smiling, laughing, sad and simply amazed. Try this anime, it's recommended for absolutely everyone, to newcomers and to those familiar with Fullmetal Alchemist.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1135, ["text"]="                          \n    Adaptations have long been a thorn in the side of anime viewers, but not because they are inherently bad. No, the main problem has been that many studios have regarded the original work almost as an afterthought, and there are a number of shows that could have been wonderful if the writers had simply stuck to the original story.\nOne of the issues at hand seems to be ownership as producers, writers and directors all seem to want the work to be reflective of their style and perception, and in order to stamp their mark on a show they will makes numerous unnecessary changes or additions.\n          \n        Admittedly there are times when the adaptation supersedes the original work, but more often than not the result is at best a decent anime, and at worst utter twaddle.\nAnd then there's the other side of the coin, where the anime adaptation sticks to the storyline set out in the original work. Normally one would expect these to be superior works, but in a strange irony this is not always the case. The problem with these types of adaptations is that the original work may not have been very good, or even have a suitable narrative, to begin with, and turning them into anime only seems to exacerbate their inherent flaws.\nFortunately, the Full Metal Alchemist franchise manages to steer clear  almost all of these pitfalls. The problem is, there are no other anime that have so evenly split the viewing public's opinion between the two versions of the series. Unlike the 2003 adaptation, Brotherhood is a faithful representation of Arakawa Hiromu's hit manga, and while many fans of the franchise laud it as the best thing since sliced bread, there are a number who consider the original anime version to be the superior tale.\nBut we'll get to that in a bit.\nMany people will already be familiar with the particulars of the story, and in a very real sense the common perception is well formed. Unfortunately, one of the problems with liking something too much is that one becomes blinded to its flaws, and while Brotherhood has very few noticeable ones where the narrative is concerned, this also serves to make them stand out.\nThe story is told in a very straight forward, no nonsense manner that is kind of refreshing given the penchant for filler episodes. The issue though, is that the content of the tale is much lighter in tone, much more typically \"shounen\" in its essence, than that of the first adaptation. One of the reasons for this is because the undercurrent of obsession amongst the main characters peters out towards the end of the story - a stark contrast to the ending in the first adaptation. Instead, these obsessive behaviours are effectively \"de-humanised\" by pushing them on to the non human characters.\nThere is a very clear sense that the plot is geared towards a more typical shounen standpoint and mentality, and while the whole still works very well as a story, one does have to wonder if the writers for the first adaptation didn't steal a march on Arakawa. It's possible that she had to change her idea of how the tale should develop because the first anime version took a much darker path than most other shounen franchises.\nThat said, the ending allows for a degree of catharsis that was missing from the first adaptation, and although there are some broad similarities between the two versions at times, in truth they are as different as chalk and cheese. As an added bonus this series is far less dependent on random comedic moments, and the difference this makes to the flow of the plot is palpable when the two versions are directly compared.\nOne big advantage that Brotherhood has is that the seven year gap has allowed for improvements in various aspects of production, and it shows in a number of areas. The animation is more fluid than before, although admittedly the difference isn't really obvious at first and only really appears during large scale action set pieces. The character designs will be very familiar to any fan, but are subtly sharper and more defined than in the previous series.\nInterestingly enough, one of the biggest plus points for Brotherhood is actually its wealth of interesting characters.\nAs one would expect, a number of the characters from the first adaptation appear in Brotherhood, but there are also several who are notable for their absence as they do no appear in the manga. Instead, a horde of new characters appear throughout the course of the series, many of whom have their own goals, ideals and personalities. Indeed the biggest difference between the two versions is the sheer number of people who all seem to have some impact on the story.\nFor much of the series Edward and Alphonse Elric behave in a manner that many who have watched the first adaptation will find familiar, and one of the nice things about this is that familiarity is used to very subtly develop the pair into very different characters. The change in their personas happens very gradually, but by the end of Brotherhood one can see just how much growth the pair has undergone.\nStrangely enough, the most interesting additions to the series are actually Yao Ling and Olivier Mira Armstrong (Alex Louis Armstrong's older sister - but without all the muscle flexing), two of the supporting roles. Yao Ling presents a strange dichotomy for the series to tackle, and while he doesn't develop as much as he possibly could have, this is offset by the moral and ethical dilemmas inherent in his situation towards the end of the series. On the other Olivier Armstrong possesses some of the strongest characterisation in the whole story, and while she is without doubt a major player at certain points of the show, what makes her interesting is the fact that the viewer is never quite sure of her goals.\nThere are a number of very strong characterisations in the series, but one of the things that is a little strange is the difference between the two versions where the homunculi are concerned. Unlike the first adaptation the homunculi in Brotherhood have very different origins, even though they still deal with similar obsessions. This raises an interesting perspective on the series as a whole, and is one of the reasons why Brotherhood is far more of a shounen tale than the original adaptation. The plot takes on a subtly lighter tone, even though it may not seem that way, once their origins are understood, and the main reason for this is the \"de-humanisation\" I mentioned earlier. The viewer is aware that these characters, though human-like in form, are not linked to humans in any way, and this awareness acts as a buffer so the viewer is less likely to question the actions and behaviour of the homunculi. In essence one is subjected to the ethos that monsters are evil and do bad things, which raises some interesting issues where Kimblee, Greed and the military's generals are concerned.\nThe quality of the acting is possibly the main reason why Brotherhood is able to pull off its feat of developing not only the familiar characters, but also the new additions. Paku Romi and Kugimiya Rie reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonse Elric, but with the exception of a few roles, the remaining cast are very different from the first outing. Now normally one might consider this a recipe for disaster, but it's a testament to the quality of not only the actor's abilities, but also the scriptwriters, that this series easily stands shoulder to shoulder with the original.\nThe music is very well composed and produced, and the series has a surprisingly large number of opening and ending themes, especially for 64 episode series. That said, fans of Brotherhood may find themselves in a bit of a quandary, especially if they prefer the OPs and EDs from the first series. As for the sound effects, they are handled in a decidedly competent manner that makes one wonder why other shounen anime seem to have trouble in this department. Granted there are occasions when there's a bit of a cacophony, but in general the effects are clear, bold, and well choreographed.\nNow unlike most viewers, I actually consider Brotherhood to be equal to the first series, and I don't really fall on one side or another. Like a number of fans my preference is for the much darker tone of the first series, however the cathartic ending of Brotherhood, as well as the improvements in production and animation, go some way to balancing the scales. Some people prefer the somewhat darker nature to Ed's character from the first adaptation, but in all honesty the rationale behind the two versions is very different, and while they're broadly the same character, that perception is only really valid until the last few episodes of either show. The same principle applies to Alphonse, Roy Mustang, in fact to most of the characters.\nThat said, Brotherhood is just as entertaining and involving as its predecessor, and it's a testament to Arakawa's skill as a mangaka that she has been able to produce a tale that, at the very least, rivals the original anime adaptation.Yes, Brotherhood is more typically shounen than the other version, but the nice thing about this is that fans are given two very good versions of the same story, and that is something rare in anime.\nNow if only all remakes, revisions or reboots could be this good.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=535,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets an immense amount of praise in the MAL community, is the #1 ranked show and is constantly referred to as a masterpiece and the greatest show ever created. I've seen many fans preach about how \"it lives up to the hype\" and \"can never receive too much praise\". Now this is just the opinion of one guy. I'm certainly not the law of the land or anything. However, I personally feel as though calling FMA:B a masterpiece and the champion of all shows is a bit of a stretch. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it or that it\n          \n        isn't a very solid addition to the ranks of notable shows; I really would like to preface this review by saying that I believe that FMA:B is a very good show and I wouldn't be nearly as harsh on it if it weren't for the God status the show has attained in America. I would happily remand \"greatest show ever made\" to \"greatest long-running shonen ever made if you haven't seen the 2011 Hunter X Hunter\"\nI'm not a huge fan of the MAL categorical rating system, as I've mentioned in some of my previous reviews. I oftentimes outright ignore it. However, looking at the categories right now, I feel as though this is one instance where I can use it to talk about everything I want to so I'm going to use it.\nSTORY: 8\nThe FMA:B plot and world-building are some of its strongest aspects. The world that it creates is an immersive, full-feeling thing with many animate pieces that move even when you aren't looking at them. It's an extremely creative world as well, adopting its own set of universal laws including alchemy through equivalent exchange, mind-body duality and its own interpretation of a higher power, and it sticks by these laws. Never once does the story contradict its own rules, instead using them in creative ways to build off of each other. The plot is also one of the most engaging parts of the show, unveiling itself at just the right pace to keep you interested whilst still keeping a few major cards to play at the very end. The pieces fall into place in a way that is satisfying because it simultaneously mind-blowing and obvious, and that's one of the marks of strong storytelling.\nWhile the FMA:B story is certainly one of the best I've seen, I find that I have to withhold my 10 score here on the grounds that its incredible direction and creativity are marred by some detrimental weaknesses. First of all, the exposition is handled extremely poorly. The first and third episodes feel like they're from some shitty cartoon network show, the show blatantly ignores the show-don't-tell rule in the entirety of its first chunk (with characters spelling out exactly what is happening and why it's happening) and its tendency to repeat important plot points over and over again quite frankly feels insulting to me as the audience as though the show is assuming I'm not able to pay attention or figure things out for myself and need to have the fact that Ed and Al committed the sin of human transmutation and lost their bodies told to me at least twenty-five times in the first two hours of show. Secondly, there's a period of time which I would probably refer to as the third fourth of the show (episodes 40-53ish) in which the show drags incredibly, adopting a typical battle-shonen approach of having characters engage in multiple-episode long one-on-one or two-on-one battles, giving them plenty of time to pose and stand off and monologue at each other. This isn't how fighting or war works, and these contrived battles really take away a lot of the climactic atmosphere. Finally, the show's ending is not nearly as satisfying as I wish it had been. The final few episodes are for the most part brilliant, but once the show plays all its cards and it's resolution time, it wraps itself up with cliches and in-your-face themes. \nART: 8\nThe art is absolutely astounding 80% of the time and absolutely horrid 20% of the time. Thus the 8 score. The action is all stunning, the openings gorgeous, the backgrounds consistent and unique, building a sense of a real lived-in world. The character designs are sometimes a little bland, but for the most part they are memorable and the homunculi look brilliant so I don't have any real complaints there.\nWhat I have a problem with is the obnoxious number of times that the show goes \"anime\" - reducing its characters to shittily-drawn caricatures and its animation to blocky, looped motion. Usually this is used during the shows attempts at humor, which I'll talk about later, but most of the time it was just extremely cringe-inducing and distracting, ruining the sense of continuity and immersion in this world. The show obviously wants you to take it seriously (it sure loves its drama) and when Al is portrayed as a big grey mound with a squiggle for a mouth it makes this difficult. There's a difference between having your character goof around and having the show itself goof around. It almost feels like a laugh-track, telling the audience \"this is the funny part!\"\nFor the most part, however, the art is gorgeous. When it counts, it shines, and that's really what matters. \nSOUND: 10\nUndeniably the strongest aspect of the show. I have no complaints whatsoever. The soundtrack is never distracting but always effective, the voice-actors (especially for Bradley and Al) absolutely nailed it and the openings and endings... dear lord. It's been said before, but the openings and endings to FMA:B are some of the very best ever made, both in sound and visuals. They tell small stories of their own. They set the tone for the episode and for their section of the show as a whole. I especially loved 'Golden Time Lover' and 'Chemistry', but I have to give special mention to SID's 'Rain'. As far as I'm concerned, that opening could have been the end of the show. It single-handedly established a sense of finality, a long-endured struggle of these characters and their causes. Everyone is portrayed as exhausted, weak and full of both despair and determination: protagonist and antagonist alike, fighting under the rain. Not for glory, not for honor, but just for the one thing they care most for. Personally, it made me extremely hyped for the final stretch of the show. It wasn't quite what we got, but at least we got some of it.\nI believe that there is an intense connection between a show's opening and the audience's willingness to appreciate it. It is very likely that the intensity of many fanbases is in part due to the ability that openings such as these have to maintain feelings in regards to the show, oftentimes perhaps even distorting or altering memories of the show itself into what the opening would have you believe the show was like rather than what it was actually like. Obvious examples that jump to mind are Sword Art Online's \"Courage\" and Guilty Crown's \"My Dearest\". Remember how those shows were absolutely nothing like that? No?? IT'S TOO LATE FOR YOU\nBut I digress.\nCHARACTER: 6\nI would definitely call out the show's characters on being the weakest link and the most undeserving of the praise that the show receives. For starters, the writing is often clunky and awkward, but that's not the main issue. It's because most of them are not really characters: they're plot devices with one or two distinguishing traits tacked on. They're entirely predictable, not because they feel like real people but because they do the same things over and over again. Al talks about what he'll do when he gets his body back. Ed talks about how they'll find a way and how they will atone for their mistakes and etc. It's not that it's melodrama: it's the fact that it's the SAME melodrama over and over again. It wasn't until sometime past episode 30 that Ed stopped sounding perpetually like a broken record and started to feel as though he were actually developing, but even then he was really just defined by his arc and not by any amount of complexity.\nAnd that's the pitfall that so many of these characters fall into. If your character's only real traits beyond their development for the sake of the show are \"hates being called short\" and \"hates milk\" they're really more of a tool with some googly eyes stuck on to them. Other characters are even worse: Armstrong is manly. His sister is more manly. Mustang wants to be Fuhrer and avenge Hughes (he's even got this great relationship with Hawkeye that could have been seriously compelling if they ever had any real conversations about anything besides \"we must overthrow the government\" and \"Hughes!\" over and over again). Winry likes Ed and automail. Ling wants to be emperor. Now, FMA:B is a complex, busy show. I could understand if it didn't have the time to make these characters anything more than chess pieces for its grand and elaborate plot, giving them a few distinguishing traits because that's really all it can manage without dragging itself out immensely. But it DOES have the time: it has all the time it spends having Ed yell about being called short. It has all the time it spends having Armstrong pull of his shirt and yell about being manly. It has all the time it spends having Ed and Al talk about getting their goddamn bodies back over and fucking over again as though I would somehow manage to forget it. Ling passing out from lack of food. May fawning comically over Ed. Mustang is antisocial LOL. The same gags, over and over again, barely even rehashed in any original way. Not only do they become painful to watch, they devour all of the development that this shallow cast of characters could have had to make me actually invested in them. They're far too static, with most of them having a single change or revelation over the course of the show's 64 episodes in order to indicate that they have grown as a person. But a good character has so much more than that: what kind of music do these people listen to? Why? Who are their role models? Why? What books do they like? What are their favorite places to eat? What do they appreciate in the people they're close to?? What are their personal histories...\nOh wait, sorry! I didn't mean to ask that last one! Please, I take it back! NOOOOOOO...\nYeah so I forgot to mention something. Screw all that stuff about making these characters possess complex personalities, FMA:B has a better way to define them.\nTRAUMA\nEveryone who's remotely relevant has a traumatic backstory. It's a harsh world, sure. I get that. Here's the issue: people are introduced and then defined through their trauma. Now this isn't Angel Beats bad, where horrible things happen to perfectly innocent people for no reason. Most of the tragedy is partially a result of the decisions of the characters involved, and their resulting struggle is a combination of having to cope with the consequences and with themselves and their mistakes. However, this cannot be used as a SUBSTITUTE for character development. A supplement, sure, but I still remember in episode four when Ed and Al meet a state alchemist who literally introduces himself with something along the lines of \"my wife left me because we were too poor\" before he even tells them his goddamn NAME. Here, come on in! Take a seat! Would you like some sorrow pie or tragic backstory cake? We have plenty! Ed and Al's dad left, then their mom died, then they f*cking ripped their bodies apart. Winry's parents were murdered in cold blood. Mustang had to kill lots of people. Armstrong had to kill lots of people. Everyone had to kill lots of people. Scar watched everyone he loved get killed, and then had to kill lots of people. These are always the first things we find out about people, and then for the rest of the show they are defined almost exclusively by them. If anyone is overly happy and wholesome, it means something horrid is going to happen to them. It's basic emotional manipulation. Look at this adorable little girl and her dog! Dead. Look at this smiling, picturesque family! Husband dead. Dead. Everyone innocuously happy has to die or lose someone close to them. The more broken and internally conflicted you are, the safer you are. There's no need to pile more grief on Scar, so he's relatively safe.\nYes, the characters suffer from repeatable and preventable problems. They exist mainly to function as morals-in-a-bottle with gags tacked on to them. They're difficult to relate to, because all we know about them is whatever themes they embody and one or two dumb jokes. Ikuhara writes characters more personable than this, and his stories don't make sense on PURPOSE. I did give the characters a 6 though, and there are reasons for that.\nFirst off, despite their lack of humanization the characters complete their tasks of being walking themes with relative effectiveness. This isn't anywhere near Log Horizon S1 bad. These characters are here for a reason, they represent something, and they represent those things well. Sure, they could have easily been better, but they fulfill their purpose and for that alone they are not failures. I will also give special mention to Scar, who, while still actively defined by his trauma was executed far more impressively than the other characters. This is probably in part because the show actually viewed him as morally ambiguous as opposed to just making the character FEEL morally ambiguous when there was really no doubt that the show wanted you to think this was a 'good guy' (*cough* Mustang)\nSecond off, there are some exceptions to the rule. Most of my complaints thusfar have been leveled at the shows protagonists. They are the ones that suffer from dismal repetition and blatant violation of show-don't-tell. Where the show does excel is with its antagonists. There are seven homunculi in the show, incarnations of the seven deadly sins, and they so utterly clobber their \"good-guy\" counterparts in terms of being engaging, personable subtle characters that it isn't even funny. Their intensive backstories are never shoved in your face, their apparent contradictions are given plenty of time to be uncovered by the viewer, and the deliciously ironic conclusions to their arcs are done tactfully. Many times I found myself actively routing for them because they were just so much more interesting and well-executed. I would happily watch an \"Adventures of the Homunculus\" spinoff cataloging the several hundred years most of them lived before the start of the series.\nENJOYMENT: 7\nI was constantly gripped by the plot. I actively looked forward to the openings and endings. The art was oftentimes orgasmic. The homunculi made me want to start looking for ingredients to make a philosopher's stone with. However, I was constantly frustrated by the show's apparent lack of respect for its viewers and by its absolutely abysmal humor. I've already said it, but I don't know if I've driven home just how infuriating it is to have exposition repeated to you over and f*cking over again and how cringe-inducing it is when somebody violates the show-don't-tell rule at extremely tense and crucial moments. It actively snapped me out of the experience whenever Ed and Al had a conversation about getting their bodies back after the 5th time it happened, and when God literally spelled out for Ed that he had discovered the meaning of life I facepalmed hard. That's not how you do themes, man. That just comes off as preachy. That's something the show suffered constantly from: it felt incredibly preachy. It's character's speeches about the answers they had found to their struggles felt much more pointed at the audience than at anyone in the show they were talking to, and that bothered the ever-loving crap out of me. And have I mentioned the humor? For every joke the show has that lands, it tries about five others that fall on their face. As I've already mentioned, they're repetitive and used as a substitute for meaningful character interactions and development. It seems as thought the show is trying to use them as a counterbalance for its immense amount of melodrama, but instead they end up just ripping apart the tone and stagnating the story. Despite these gripes, I did overall enjoy the experience and felt that the positives did inevitably outweigh the negatives so I will happily give it a 7 for enjoyment.\nOVERALL: 7\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is not a masterpiece. It's a very respectable, unique, inspired and creative show and it's definitely a classic. I would happily recommend this to most people. However, don't go in with irrational expectations. It's enjoyable, it's engaging, it will definitely give you plenty to think about, but in my personal opinion it gets a little too much praise and a little too much hype. I probably would have enjoyed it more myself if I hadn't heard nothing but angelic worship for it before going into it. I formally apologize to any huge fans of the show that I may have offended: it's not by any means a bad show! I don't give out 7s all that lightly, believe me. This is merely an argument against FMA:B being the be-all-end-all of anime. Thanks for reading if you made it through that wall of text, and have a nice day!"},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=389,  ["text"]="                          \n    Overview:\nFMA Brotherhood is an anime that needs no introduction. This is the highest rated anime on all of MAL. This is the anime that the current generation of anime fans holds above all others as the greatest single anime EVER made! In the following paragraphs, I will be reviewing this legendary series and discussing whether or not it truly deserves this title.\n\nSPOILERS for both Brotherhood and 2003 FMA!!!!\nPlot: \nThe plot takes place in the country of Armestris, which is basically like an alternate WW2 Germany. It is constantly at war for reasons that are less than just and is ruled by a rather nefarious government.\n          \n        What makes this world special is that alchemy is the primary science instead of the much less fun and flashy science of our own reality. Alchemy allows practitioners to transmute material into other useful material, and basically do all kinds of awesome stuff! Our heroes are the Elric brothers, who wish to find the legendary Philosopher's Stone and gain back their original bodies that they lost in a forbidden alchemy ritual gone horribly wrong. In order to search for the stone, they join the military. Unfortunately this means they have to serve under a rather evil government and face strong moral dilemmas. The Elric brothers don't wish to take part in the government's genocidal campaigns, but they need the military in order to accomplish their own personal goals. Of course, things are a bit more complicated by the fact that many in the military are actually good people and are either unaware of just how bad the government is, or feel remorse for their crimes and  wish to change the government. This is refreshing for a shonen series in which \"good and evil\" is too often clear cut. We have all seen Hollywood movies where the German Army is filled with nothing but pure evil monsters with zero humanity. As a side note, eventually Hollywood got MUCH better with treating the Germans this way... thanks to us ethnic Germans making up 40% of the US population, but Hollywood STILL treats the Russians and certain other groups this way! \nEventually, the Elric brothers uncover the frightening truth that the real leader behind the government is an ancient evil being called \"Father\" who uses his homunculus minions to due his bidding and wishes for ultimate knowledge and power! The Elric brothers also make many allies on their adventures including Scar, the Xingese, and Hohenheim, who all contribute in the fight against Father. The plot ultimately concludes with a very happy ending, which pleased fans far more than the bittersweet ending of the 2003 anime. It should also be noted that unlike the plot of the 2003 anime, FMA Brotherhood mostly stays faithful the Hiromu Arakawa's original manga.\nDifferences between 2003 FMA and Brotherhood:\nAlthough there are many differences in the plot which I will get to, the most immediately obvious difference is in the tone of the series' narrative. The 2003 FMA has a VERY dark and somber tone throughout the series, which makes it really stand out as the oddball of the shonen world. FMA Brotherhood has tragic moments, but they are balanced out with zany comedy, more happy endings, and less emotional suffering in general. The tone in Brotherhood actually feels like you are watching a shonen anime like Naruto or One Piece. You know going in that there will be sad parts, but all will turn out well in the end. FMA 2003 feels closer to watching Berserk than it does to watching Naruto or One Piece! Whether a viewer prefers lighthearted shonen or brooding seinen is a matter of taste, but let us take a look at the subject matter being dealt with in this series. In both the 2003 FMA and Brotherhood, this is a series about German soldiers serving a genocidal regime and ultimately having to rebel against the government and try atone for their crimes. Does that sound like something that should be a fun, zany comedy? \"It is almost certain that we will fail. But how will future history judge the German people if not even a handful of men had the courage to put an end to that criminal?\" - Henning Von Tresckow. I can ASSURE you he didn't tell a stupid joke 20 seconds afterwards so that his listeners wouldn't feel sad about the deaths of 17 million civilians murdered by the Nazis as \"untermenschen\". Was the movie Das Boot a fun comedy? NO! Have you ever wondered why that is? The reason is that making a movie or series about German soldiers reflecting on mass genocide into a delightful romp is fucking stupid as hell! To think that people on MAL accuse Elfen Lied of having bad tone whiplash. FMA Brotherhood thematically achieves a mood whiplash other anime can only dream of.\nNow we get to characters and plot differences. Firstly, lets talk about everyone's favorite FMA character, Roy Mustang. In FMA 2003, Roy is the one who murdered Winry's parents instead of Scar. Roy is also MUCH more affected by his guilt for having murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in the name of an evil government. In 2003 FMA, Roy actually tries to kill himself in a state of deep depression, but Hughes stops him and instead inspires him to live, so that one day he can overthrow and lead the government. Roy actually manages to kill Fuhrer Bradley and do what he had dreamed of for so long. However, he is too overwhelmed by the emotional stress to simply stay in the military and take a role of leadership like he does in Brotherhood. Roy retires to a simple life with Hawkeye instead and only uses his alchemy again in the movie Conquerors of Shamballa to save the people of Central. Roy is a MUCH more empathetic and truly human character in the original 2003 series. He is actually, truly effected by guilt and stress the way a real person that isn't a total sociopath would be. He doesn't just feel kind of bad for about 5 minutes, then move on. \"I killed those people under orders, I don't have to REALLY feel too bad about it.\" If the point is to make Roy a true military hero that reveals the full horrors of war and shows how even good men will commit evil deeds under orders, then the 2003 anime accomplishes this a LOT better than Brotherhood did!\nNow let's look at the Arab anti-hero Scar. In both series, Scar is a survivor of the Ishvalan genocide who is consumed with the desire for vengeance against the State Alchemists that slaughtered his people. In both series, Scar has an elder brother who violated Scar's Ishvalan religion and practiced alchemy, ultimately saving his life and giving him his special arm. However, in the 2003 anime we learn that Scar's brother violated a FAR more sacred law and tried to resurrect his dead lover with alchemy. This was of course a miserable failure that drove his brother mad with grief and furthered Scar's hatred of alchemy. This works better in terms of narrative, because it gives Scar even more reason to hate alchemy as violently as he does and view it as \"false\". It also better explains why Scar sympathized with Edward Elric, because he could tell he had lost his limbs in a human transmutation and was reminded of his own brother. In terms of objective \"writing 101\" and constructing a narrative, this extra back story from the 2003 anime was brilliant and felt far more complete than Brotherhood. Scar's end is also WAY better in the original 2003 anime. In Brotherhood, Scar fights his ultimate battle against Wrath, who was only the 3rd strongest homunculi, not the real mastermind behind the Ishvalan genocide, and had no real connection to Scar since they had never met. In the 2003 series, Scar fights his ultimate battle against the pure evil State Alchemist Zolf Kimblee, who murdered his brother and gave him his namesake scar. Which of these makes sense in terms of basic storytelling? Having a character's big fight be against a personal opponent where the struggle actually MEANS something, or have the fight be against a barely connected random character? It is sad that Scar has to die in the 2003 series, but his death is a heroic one and ultimately a much better written conclusion to his story. In Brotherhood, Scar somehow survives in order for a happier ending and we get a quick cameo of him working to rebuild Ishval. Scar is a flawed anti-hero consumed with a desire for revenge. In the original series, his tragic and heroic death makes the audience care a LOT more about him than Brotherhood does. Would it have been good storytelling in Lord of the Rings if Boromir for some reason survived, then we get a quick 2 sentences about how he is living happily in Gondor after the war? No. That would be really stupid and Tolkien being a good writer, realized that and gave Boromir a heroic death of penance that better closed his story.\nThere are WAY too many examples, so we will make our final one a comparison between Dante and Father. How can I even compare them? You are probably thinking right now. \"Dante is just a forgettable Filler Villain and Father is one of the greatest villains in anime history!\" The truth is that Father...isn't actually a very good villain. Remember that this is a story about an alternate WW2 Germany and a group of soldiers fighting against an evil government following a massive genocide. Adolf Hitler was not a nice man, but he WAS a human being. Dante is powerful, but ultimately just an ordinary human sociopath who wishes to sacrifice countless people she views as inferior to guarantee her own Godhood and immortality. I think that sounds a LOT closer to Hitler than a fucking ink blot genie from Ancient Persia looking for ultimate knowledge. If you are going to tell a story with OBVIOUS real world parallels, then STAY CONSISTENT! Government atrocities and genocides happen due to ordinary human leaders with extremely selfish desires, NOT evil genies! The Holocaust, Cambodian Genocide, Rwandan Genocide, and Armenian Genocide were not caused by Mr. Popo!!!\n\nAnimation:\nFMA Brotherhood is a very well animated series and admittedly does look better in most places than the 2003 original. Is the animation enough to give it the title of greatest of all time? No. \n\nSoundtrack:\nThe soundtrack for FMA Brotherhood is once again quite solid, but isn't even as good as the 2003 FMA OST, let alone worthy of the greatest of all time title! Just compare the main theme from the Brotherhood OST to the main theme Bratja from 2003 FMA. The main theme for Brotherhood is a fairly bland orchestral piece with some ominous chanting that sounds like a throw away extra from the Hellsing Ultimate soundtrack. The main theme from the 2003 FMA is a heartbreaking, beautiful song about an elder brother asking forgiveness from his younger brother. Bratja is WAY better than anything in Brotherhood without question! Compare the first opening theme of Brotherhood to the 1st opening of the 2003 series. The 2003 series has Ready Steady Go, one of the greatest openings in the history of anime. Brotherhood has an extremely forgettable opening that wouldn't rank in the top 500 anime openings.\nOverall:\nFMA Brotherhood is a good anime overall, but it is ONLY a good anime. It isn't anywhere NEAR the greatest anime ever made! It is actually vastly inferior to the original 2003 FMA and even that wasn't the single greatest anime of all time, although a MUCH better candidate than Brotherhood. Of course the title of G.O.A.T. is a highly subjective and debatable matter, but there isn't a single category where Brotherhood REALLY outshines its competitors. Some people say Legend of the Galactic Heroes is the greatest of all time. I'm not going to say that LOTGH is an absolutely flawless work, because it isn't. However, it actually stays consistent in its tone with the heavy ideas and themes it presents. Brotherhood does not. Brotherhood is WAY closer to Elfen Lied than LOTGH in terms of keeping a consistent tone  to respect very dark and serious subject matters. LOTGH has an absolutely EPIC scope with hundreds of well written characters, maybe the most intricate politics in all of anime, and gets viewers to really think about real world problems and issues in terms of government, better than any other anime ever made. In other words, LOTGH actually DOES have areas where it clearly outshines its peers and therefore has a far more legitimate claim to the throne. Cowboy Bebop has almost without question the greatest original OST in anime history, is more accessible to non-anime fans than any other anime, and is an absolute blast from beginning to end. Once again, it has areas where it is clearly the best, so a more legitimate claim. Name just ONE thing that Brotherhood is the best at? Most tearjerking? nope. Best written? not even close. Most philosophical and complex? Hell no. Best art? nope. Best soundtrack? nope. It is solid around the board, but it isn't actually truly great at anything! I would therefore argue that Brotherhood is NOT the greatest of all time, is INSANELY overrated, and you are honestly much better off watching the 2003 FMA. I'm sorry if this review hurt any feelings. My job as a critic is to say what needs to be said.\n"},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=209,  ["text"]="                          \n    Since I couldn't find any legitimate objective analysis in any of these fanboy reviews, I decided put my own review: \nHere's why FMA:B and it's Manga counterpart don't work:\nIt's just a disjointed piece of art. The initial premise of the narrative: two young siblings that horrifically lose their mother and parts of themselves is incredibly dark and powerfully poignant. Their journey to find the philosophers stone is one that's objectively adventurous but the endpoint is still inherently adult and sophisticatedly gritty; especially as it delves into the implications of bringing a dead person back to life early on in the series.\nSo why is it disjointed?\n          \n        Because there's a mistranslation of tonal nuance throughout the entire series. Now I don't mean stylistic aspects such as art style choices e.g. Chibi segments (because those are minuscule details in the grand scheme of storytelling devices), but rather the way they're implemented in the story. For example, one second we're dealing with the introspective reconciliation of human birth and how beautiful it is and the very next we drop it for side-gags just to transition into the next topic/character development. It just doesn't fit. It's formulaic. It's predictable storytelling at it's finest and it absolutely ruins the pacing.\nIt's a huge shame because the character development and dialogue in the series is exquisitely written (some of the best in any story I've ever seen); e.g. Edward's speech about his existential crisis provided a deep psychoanalytical view into his personality and character. This is amazing character development! However it actually lessens the impact of the narrative and my personal enjoyment of the series because it contrasts heavily with the tone of the series. Right down to the very commercial transitions with the quirky voice-over of the title; every little stylistic choice is presented as a complete antithesis to the themes of the series.\nFullmetal Alchemist should NOT be sugarcoated with a light-hearted aesthetic. This is something I'd hate to say in any other series because pretentiously \"dark and gritty\" series (*cough* Tokyo Ghoul *cough*) are the bane of my existence but this is the one exception. If the themes of the series are of complex adult issues, why is the tone appealing to childish humour and zany adventurous antics?\nWith all that being said, I totally understand why Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is considered one of the greatest Animes of all time because it is substantially provocative and extremely complex behind the aesthetics much like many other great Animes like One Piece, Hunter X Hunger, Cowboy Bebop and Dragon Ball.\nPersonally, it just doesn't work from a narrative perspective because it feels disjointed and unfocused in the way it clashes with stylistic ambiguity. Through this loss of tone, the series becomes a chain of loose threads that are vaguely commentating on the overall themes of the narrative which is why I rated Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and the Manga: 5/10.\n        "},

This is a NO FILLER anime it gets straight to the point with it's beautiful animation and amazing portrayal of the manga, everything is so different! Emotions are strong and there's more of a connection between characters then in the original anime, you immediately get dragged into this show within the first 5 minuets, this is honestly one of the most spectacular anime's i've ever laid my eyes on, it's definitely one of the best new shows of the last couple years. Its a definite watch, don't miss out!\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=229,  ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Now, this is a prime example of how to adapt an manga into an anime the RIGHT way.  The original Fullmetal Alchemist, though well made and very popular, went into a downward spiral as soon as it diverted from the manga storyline and never seemed to recover.  This however, shows that instead of trying to add their own story elements when adapting manga/visual novels etc., sometimes anime producers should just sit back and retell the great story that has already been written in the original.\nThis anime starts off at a breakneck pace.  It shoots entire volumes of the manga in a couple\n          \n        of episodes.  It was to be expected though, as Bones is trying to fit 100+ chapters of manga into a 1-year long series.  However, once you get used to it the pacing seems very appropriate for the series and only seems to increase the suspense.  While small elements have been omitted from the manga, these are mainly non-essential and have no impact on the story.  Yet while many of these omitted elements are comedic in nature, Brotherhood still manages to switch between seriousness and comedy so fast you'll get whiplash.  I quite enjoyed this particularly as a sort of trademark of the series.  The actual plot-line twists and turns in unexpected ways and keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the climax grips you like no other.  Many disregard the plot as being generically shonen, but it is these twists and its exploration into the psyche and motivation of the characters that propel it past this \"generic shonen\" label.\nThe art is of a different style to the original FMA.  It is a little simpler, and comedic scenes sometimes even stray into an outright chibi style, but this is by no means a bad thing.  If anything it is closer to the the style that Hiromu Arakawa draws with in the manga.  What its lacking in detail, it makes up for with first-class fight sequences (as to be expected of Bones).  The animation overall is quite polished and character movements are very fluid and natural.\nThe characters on both sides really caught my attention as one of this series' strengths.  It boasts a diverse range of characters, all of which have considerable substance and a distinct purpose in the storyline.  The Homunculi especially turn out to be completely different from the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime, and more awesome in my opinion.  Edward and Alphonse are still the main focus of the story as they quest to find the Philosophers' Stone and restore their bodies, but now Winry also takes a more central role along with Ed and Al's father, Hohenheim.  There is also a host of new characters which didn't feature in the first anime adaptation, including a few from the mysterious country Xing and a new main villain.  Being completely faithful to the manga, all the characters' separate journeys and origins are told in much greater detail.  Each character's values and beliefs are tested almost to breaking point as the story reaches its later stages, providing a somewhat surprising and refreshing depth to the cast.\nThe one thing I initially disliked about this series was the soundtrack, which lacked substance and was very repetitive.  The first opening was brilliant, one of the best I have seen, but the background music was lacklustre.  However, as the series went on more music was added and the soundtrack began to add a great atmosphere to fight scenes and dialogue alike.  The voice actors also really show their ability throughout the series and seem very well suited to their roles.  With such an all-star cast of voice-actors you wouldn't expect any less.\nOverall Bones has done an awesome job surpassing its previous effort and faithfully retelling the Fullmetal Alchemist manga.  Enjoyment wise, you'd be hard pressed to find a shonen anime that will entertain you as much as FMA Brotherhood.  Truly a great anime, there's no other way to describe it.  A must-see for people new to anime and hardened otakus alike.  Overall score: 9.4/10 (rounded to 9).\n        "},

We can't even save a little girl, so what good are we?\"-Edward Elric\nNow let's talk about the best rated show on this website. Ever since its release, fans and critics alike have a mixed reaction to the show. Some of them say that the original show is better while others say this is better. I can't see why we can't like both. They each have things that really work about them. I think they are both masterpieces on a entertainment and artistic level. Some moments in the show will make you laugh, then the next question life, and then\n          \n        cry your eyes out. Some moments in the show are just plain beautiful from the characters, animation, and the really touching moments. There are moments were some of the characters you get attached to die. (Not going to tell what characters because of spoilers, obviously.) A character will get super depressed, and one even almost goes insane. All of these characters express real human emotions unlike some other anime which they express one key emotion. The emotional scenes aren't forced, they have a really big impact on you as a person. You'll start to relate to every character and even question life. Some examples being \"What is the truth?\" or \"Could humans play the role of god?\" That's why I love this show so much. You'll start to look at the world in a different perspective after you watch this and the original show. Now shall we get to the review?\nStory 10/10 Standout(s) The fantastic end to the series\nIf you want to know my original thoughts of the story, read my review of the original show. Anyway the end to this anime is one of the best endings I've ever seen in an anime. It was very beautiful and touching. This review is suppose to be spoiler free (In most cases.) So I can't tell you my thoughts of the ending. If you want more in detail of the ending, just ask me. Anyway, I can't talk about much about the story without repeating myself, so let's go to the art and animation.\nArt and Animation 10/10 Standout(s) The animation\nYou can tell that they had a huge budget just by looking at a character. It was very solid and very easy on the eyes. This really shines in the well animated action scenes. They were just plain epic! What I didn't explain in full detail in my review of the original was the character designs. I didn't give enough praise for them, I just said they were creative and expressive, that was it. You can tell which character is who at first glance. That's a really hard thing to do for a 64 episode anime, but this show pulls it off very well. The character's have there own unique features that stand out among the rest. Now let's go to the sound.\nSound 10/10 Standout(s) The dub\nThe soundtrack really fit in with the anime. I mostly loved the music they played in the action scenes or when there was something bad going on. I found it very unique and weirdly fit with the tension of a scene. For the dub, most people consider it one of the best dubs out there and I don't blame them. The only difference between the dub for the original and the dub for this was Al's actor. Al's original actor, Aaron Dismuke, had too deep of a voice to play Al anymore. So they got Maxey Whitehead to play him. So was Maxey good as Al? She did a fantastic job in my eyes. When I saw the first episode, I thought that was the original actor. That's how good her performance was. If you want me to go in depth about the dub, read my review of the original. Now the one you've all been waiting for, the characters.\nCharacters 10/10 Standout(s) Every single one of them\nThis is my favorite character cast in any anime. They were all very entertaining in their own little way. If you want to hear me talk about Ed and Al, read my review of the original show. Let's just talk about Roy Mustang and Maes Hughes.\nRoy Mustang:\nOn the outside, Roy seems like the calm, collected, and cool guy. On the inside he values the lives of his comrades like Riza Hawkeye and Maes Hughes. If one of them were to die, he would just be sad for the rest of his life. He also has a temper that sometimes gets the best of him. This is a guy you don't want to mess with. He'll burn you to death with his flame alchemy. What makes Roy such a good character is that he'll protect those he values with all his heart. He does have a few weaknesses too, you can't have a good character without his or her faults. Like I said, his temper and the fact that if you were to kill one of his friends, he would vow to kill you no matter what and won't forgive you. He doesn't forgive his enemies that easily. Overall, Roy is defiantly one of the best characters in this anime.\nMaes Hughes:\nHughes may seem like the comic relief when you first meet him, but he has more of a personality then that. He is kind, outgoing, and an overall funny person! It's kind of weird how him and Roy get along so well. Hughes is more fun and loud while Roy is more calm and collected. He loves so many people and almost doesn't hate anyone. He loves his daughter and his wife. There's even a few jokes about them in some of the episodes. It feels like his family is the military, his real family, and the Elric brothers. He made a huge impact on the audience for reasons I won't spoil. Overall, a fun guy and a great character!\nEnjoyment 10/10\nPeople who will love this show: Everyone, especially fans of the manga.\nPeople who won't like this show: I don't know who wouldn't like this.\nOverall 10/10\nPositives: Everything\nNegatives: None\nThis is defiantly one of the best animated shows of all time. It's amazing how many things you'll learn in this anime. It taught me all sorts of things about life. I am in love with this series. Great anime and deserves a 10 from everyone. So watch it if you haven't. \n        "},

I never even tried to follow the original anime.. I knew it was a big success and has a lot of followers everywhere. But it just didn't catch onto me like it did with so many others. With this renewed version, which follows the manga storyline a lot more precise than the first version, the team behind FMA: Brotherhood did a fantastic job. \nThe characters are instantly attractive.. what I mean with that is they are very well portrayed as people,\n          \n        unlike so many other anime shows. The story is also instantly compelling.. it drops you right into the world of FMA and does a thorough job of explaining to you how things work. And as far as I've seen, the story never gets repetitive or old. As soon as you finish one episode.. you'll force yourself to watch the next. \nThe voice actors are another major plus. The sheer talent of many of them is just unbelievable. I especially liked the fact that the voice actor who did (among others) Kira/Yagami Light's voice in Death Note, Mamoru Miyano. Does the voice for Ling Yao, which makes his character even more intriguing. \nIf FMA Brotherhood keeps up this kind of pace, quality and plot development, then I'm definitely going to add it to my 'All-time-favourite-anime' list. \nA must see!\n        "},

As a result alphonse is left without his body and stuck to a metal armor and ed with a metal arm and a leg  thus the nickname fullmetal. Thus the two brothers embark on a quest to find the famous philosopher's Stone that is said\n          \n        to allow alchemists to ignore the law of equivalent exchange and help them get their bodies back. I will not go into more details because it will spoil the wonderfull story of the anime. Anyway let's get started. \nAs opposed to it's 2003 counterpart  Brotherhood does not have filler episodes or sidestories, the manga being almost finished at the time the anime started. There were a few ovas and specials that came out towards the animes end or after it had finished but I am not counting those.But I have to say they managed to strike a perfect balance. Since it had all the source material it needed the anime does not feel stale,I think it goes on  at a great pace  and it manages to strike a perfect balance between fights, serious moments, light hearted ones . But if you are a big fan of the 2003 anime you might find this a bit too fast as some of the characters lack the development they had in the first series and you might not feel as attached to them as you were back then. Though personally I loved the pacing, as I never got bored and I got entangled in a wonderfull story that just kept dragging me in.\nThe art has greatly improved over its predecessor and even now it's way above your usual animes. The facial expressions are great and the battles, oh man they are going to give you a boner, even if you're a girl. Trust me. Though some people might be set off a bit by the fact that the animation style seems to change from battle to battle, but I think that increases it's quality as very rarely you will have the same two characters battling each-other thus each battle seems unique and fresh. I especially enjoy the ones that involve Wrath as man he is a beast.\nThe sound is great. I have watched the anime in jappanese thus that is the sound version I shall review.Romi Park and Rie Kugimiya reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonnes and deliver a top quallity performance yet again, but the rest of the cast is not going to let you down either as you can feel they actually enjoy voice acting these characters and that they give their all in their performance. Also I swear to god all the openings and endings are epic. I have all those songs on my playlist at the moment since god they are awesome and fit the show perfectly. \nI also like the fact they Brotherhood doesn't do something a lot of anime do and by that I mean they do not spoil what will happen in the anime with the intro or outro because they are all custom made and not just scenes picked up from the anime to show off.\nNow the greatest strength of the anime are its characters. The original series mostly explored just the two protagonists Edward and Al, but brotherhood manages to show off almost any character they introduce, their motives and their dreams. For example Roy Mustang and his dream to become the next Fuhrer to protect all his comrades or scar's dream first of revenge and later of change. As I said earlier some might characters might feel a bit rushed because of the fast pace of the anime (I'm looking at you hughes and nina) but I assure you it does not draw back from the story one bit as they still somehow fullfill their role.\nThe anime lacks a bit in the replay value, as you wil already know all the big reveals which will probably detract a little from the overall enjoyment  for some, but I watched it multiple times (around once every one and a half years) and I found it refreshing most of the time.\nAlso if you want to watch the 2003 series you should do it before you watch Brotherhood for one simple reason. The 2003 anime is also a very solid addition to one's library but Brotherhood is the superior version in all areas and you might not enjoy the 2003 version as much if you watch it after brotherhood. Though if you watch the new series after the 2003 one you will definetly still enjoy it as much, if not even more,  as opposed to watching it first.\nOverall this will always be one of the most enjoyable animes I have ever watched, excelling in all areas with a very compelling story line, complex characters, astonishing art and epic soundtracks. I wholeheartedly recommend you go watch it right now, it is a classic and a must see for any anime enthusiast out there.\n        "},

FMA Brotherhood has been popping up in Best Anime Lists on Youtube so it piqued my interest.\nIt follows, or rather it is more parallel with the story in the manga. The art and animation is magnificent, it stayed true to the characters' design but there was a more polished look. The fluidity of the movements during fight scenes are also a feast for the eyes.\nI could not find a single flaw in this series (except I that I wanted\n          \n        more episodes). The characters were all wonderfully written. It's hard to create secondary characters that are as strong as the main ones when it comes to viewers' attachments. \nI found myself falling in love with these amazing characters while I was watching FMAB. It didn't matter if the characters were only shown for one episode, I'm looking at you Nina and Alexander. What mattered was the impact those characters gave. (Like a sledge hammer to the heart)\nAnd the story, it's hard to find words to describe FMAB's story. The only thing I can think of is that it's magnificent. It's funny, action packed, mysterious heart wrenching and beautiful. \nThis is one of those anime that will leave you feeling empty after you finish it. And I mean that in a good way. I've invested so much emotions in this story, in these characters that when it's finally over it left me feeling lost. That is how amazing this is and I'm not just saying that. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is quite a masterpiece in my opinion. \n        "},

I don't think I have watched another anime where I love the Japanese voices and the English. Fantastic job from everyone. 10\nCharacter: Oh my god again perfection. The characters are all great. You basically grow up with Ed, and Al. There physical, and mental transitions are so subtle that you really feel like you are watching them grow. Some anime have time skips where they just skip like seven years and then just throw you in, but not This anime you watch them grow it is amazing. 10\nEnjoyment and overall: My enjoyment is through the roof. FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a masterpiece that I think is going to stand the fates of time well. I was never bored like I am with some anime. I was always hooked.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=133,  ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I'll start this by saying that despite being an adamant fan of Fullmetal Alchemist for a couple of years now, I've never managed to finish the first anime series. I've remained caught up with the manga as much as possible, however, and I'm very excited at where this series is going to go.\nFullmetal Alchemist, as I'm sure you know, is the story of the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse. Their story begins a number of years before the actual start of the series, with the tragic death of the boys' mother. Edward and Alphonse, child prodigy alchemists at the time, form a pact to resurrect\n          \n        her. Extensive alchemical training finally culminates in the most important experiment of their lives; the forbidden practice of Necromancy. But something goes wrong.\nEdward is forced to stare in horror as his brother is decomposed before his eyes. He is then whisked away to a mysterious location, where a strange entity reveals to him what the experiment lacked; the Philosopher's Stone. Edward is then returned to his home, where he discovers his brother still missing and his own leg gone. In an act of desperation, he sacrifices his own arm in order to preserve his brother's soul into a suit of armor. Events thereafter eventually culminate in a new mission for the Elrics; to procure the Philosopher's Stone and use it to recreate their own bodies.\nSounds like heavy stuff, right?\nOne of the best things about this series is that it manages to provide some great humor that actually fits quite nicely into its overall dark premise. There are some definite lighthearted moments, but never at the cost of plot, and they never take away from the genuinely touching or tragic scenes. The story itself is very enjoyable, and tends to explore some very deep themes, such as the ethics of resurrecting the dead and the effects of war on individuals and societies.\nStoryline aside, this series is visually stunning. Every cell of animation is detailed enough to almost seem like live action, and the characters themselves, based closely on manga author Hiromu Arakawa's original designs, are positively beautiful in motion. Some may be slightly bothered by the atypical face structures, but I find that they range between unnoticeable and and an improvement over the original series'. The movement is fluid and natural to the point that the opening alone should be enough for any animation enthusiast to be satisfied.\nCharacters are very entertaining. The very best, as I can assure you from following the manga, are a bit down the road, but the cast as of two episodes in are more than enough to tide anyone over. Roy Mustang is the perfect blend of snarky and serious, with a bit of eccentricity thrown in that any fans of the original anime series should be well familiar with (Tiny Miniskirts will almost assuredly make an appearance in this series once more,) and Edward Elric's familiar short temper, large ego, comedic frustration and occasional moments of genuine caring blend together in what is shaping up to be even better than last time.\nOne interesting thing about this series is the very first episode. It chronicles the events of an incident in central involving Isaac McDougal, a State Alchemist turned rebel after the Ishbal War, also known as Isaac the Freezer for his water-based alchemy specialty. This was never a part of the original Manga, and indeed only invented to keep audiences from experiencing Deja Vu from the first series. However, it is of such high quality and entertainment value that calling it filler would be downright unfair. It sets the stage for the rest of the series wonderfully and lets you know right away that you're in for a wild ride.\nIn short, this is a series to stick with. It's already fantastic, and I can assure those of you who have never read the manga that it only goes up from here. A definite 10/10.\n        "},

The first anime adaptation was satisfactory, but left a bad aftertaste.\nEnter FMA: Brotherhood. Now this is a spectacular adaptation worthy of the manga; this is the epitome of a masterpiece anime. The series is just the right length; the storyline never drags, or falters. Although FMA:BH is strung together with an incredible strong plot, the characters are the real highlights of the series; the majority of the cast is thoroughly fully fleshed out with dilemmas worthy of our attention. And while author places nearly all major characters in perilous decisions, and they\n          \n        oftentimes follow through with these heinous choices, one cannot help but offer up sympathy to these fictional characters. There were many times where I frowned upon some of their judgement, but I often found myself contemplating: Could I have made a better decision if I were in their shoes?\nThe Elric brothers are amazing protagonists to follow in this splendid coming-of-age story. In the end, many of my values in regards to adults, decisions, and moral choices were uprooted, and I find myself realizing that more and more, life is less black and white, but moreso filled with shades of grey.\nDefinitely watch this series. Might I add, some of the soundtrack borrows from classical pieces such as Chopin's Etude Op.10 No.3, which only made the emotional scenes hit me *that* much harder.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=123,  ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    There isn't much more I could say with all the praise it already has, but I truly believe that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood deserves every bit of it.\nThe pacing is phenomenal; filler is minimal to nonexistent and every episode serves as another step forward. I know a few people who thought that the first few episodes were not explanatory enough, but one of the great things about it is its lack of unnecessarily long narratives; it gives you just enough background information without petulantly walking you through it.\nFMAB is also one of the only anime that I prefer the dubbed version over the subbed. The voice\n          \n        actors are fit fantastically in their roles, and the openings and endings were, for the most part, great. The animation was gorgeous as well, especially in action shots.\nBut I think the most important thing to be taken into account is the plot and characters. At its center, FMAB is about two brothers who have just enough flaws for you to emotionally connect with them, but not so many that it crosses the boundary into overly annoying. The length (64 episodes) allows for steady character development, whether it be for the better or worse. Even the villains have some sort of depth without making it seem like a rushed pity backstory. It can sometimes have crass humor (which serves surprisingly well as comic relief), but it is also harshly realistic; good people die and there isn't always a good reason for it.\nSo go watch it! I hope you'll love it as much as I do.\n        "},

Because if you don't believe in yourself, you will not only bring down yourself, but also many others that believe you and depend on you.\"\nIt may not be a quote directly cited from the series, but it is one of the things this series has taught me. This show was great from start to end, and despite knowing some spoilers beforehand, it still delivered to a 10 out of 10 rating - something that's not usually happening for a shonen anime because they tend to overuse a certain trope.\nTo kick off, I have been fairly reluctant to watch Fullmetal\n          \n        Alchemist: Brotherhood, because I have already seen the first series before the remake happened, and I was afraid that half of the anime would be the same as season 1, but since I heard it had rave reviews, I have put it in the corner of my plan to watch list anyway. Some long time after that, I heard the threat that many anime sites are going to be shut down, and I panicked by mass-watching anime and reading manga. Fullmetal Alchemist was one of the anime I started to watch during that period.\nThe story was admittedly a little predictable. But that might have been because I saw the first season, and a few spoilers on what happens ahead, or it might have not been. Despite the fair predictability, the anime has still delivered a great dose of tension, drama, fun, light-hearted moments to not make me burst out in tears from the heavy dramatic ones, and also action - thus I believe majority of the viewers would enjoy. If anyone is discouraged by the 64 episodes, just start slowly, you'll notice it will consume you in no time, because this anime is one of the few that are neither rushed or way too slow-paced.\nSome people say D.Gray-man sneaks around seinen territory, but not nearly as much as this anime. The plot gets into a fairly dark theme at times, sometimes even gets slightly into political matters...  and the art matches it well. The colors are not very vibrant, which might have taken a toll on the character designs - then again, this toll has made the characters even more believable and gave distinctive features to them and their descendants.\nThe soundtrack matches the mood of the anime in all possible moments. Violin is used for several melodies of the soundtrack, which make a perfect match for the dark theme of the anime. As for the openings and endings, they consist of catchy songs, which serve as a great introduction/outro of the episodes. I also have no remarks to the seiyuus, as they did a fairly well job to match the characters' profile.\nWith matching art and matching voice actors, it is possible to admit the fact that the profile of the characters is constructed to be fairly believable - they have their ups and downs, and it is possible to tell where the characters \"got that attitude from\". Their reactions are also believable; they do not overreact as much as it happens on other anime of this genre. I would cite a few examples, but I'd prefer to avoid any spoilers so you see that for yourself.\nWith all that overall, Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood was a very captivating and enjoyable show, captivating me enough to take much breaks than most anime I have watched. I believe the masterpiece rating is indeed deserved for this one, although I wouldn't quite recommend it for starting audiences, as it would make their expectations of other anime series too high... then again I'm just kidding! You probably won't regret watching this one whatever audience you are from, but I can't tell you that for sure - you'll have to see for yourself.\n        "},

Simple: (besides a few irritations) there is nothing wrong with this show.\nThe story follows two brothers who live in a corrupted country in a world where alchemy is possible. After their mother dies, they try to perform the ultimate taboo of alchemy: human transmutation. The transmutation backfires and the younger brother (Al) loses his entire body and the older brother (Ed) loses his left leg. In order to bring Al back, Ed sacrifices his right arm to bond Al's spirit to a suit of armor. Now,\n          \n        with Ed having a mechanical arm and leg, and Al having a suit of armor for a body, they are willing to join the corrupted military in order to find a way to bring each others bodies back to their original form. Now tell me that story doesn't seem awesome to you? Story: 10/10\nThe animation is simply fantastic. Since FMA:B is considered to be on the more \"shounen\" side of anime, animation is key to it's success. And, boy did they hit the nail on the head with the beautiful animation. Art: 10/10\nThe dub is absolutely amazing! FMA:B has arguably the best dubs ever made. It is one of the rare instances where the dub is just as good as the sub, so watch it either way! As for the sound track? Oh my gawd... you haven't experienced true awesomeness until you've heard FMA:B's main theme! Not to mention that every single opening is absolutely breathtaking. Sound: 10/10\nOne of the things that makes FMA:B so awesome is that everyone has a purpose behind their actions, and there is no such thing as a \"dull\" character in this anime. Even the biggest antagonist have a goal they are trying to accomplish, making even the biggest villains lovable. Characters: 10/10\nThere is never a dull moment in FMA:B where they just sit around doing nothing. There are rarely ever any filler episodes (if any at all), leaving the show to become full of wonderful twists and turns that will drag you in right away. Enjoyment: 10/10\nDoes FMA:B have some flaws? Yeah, I guess. However, most of these flaws don't exactly work against the show as a whole. One of FMA:B's biggest flaw is the first ten or so episodes. It's not that they aren't interesting (trust me, they are) but rather they often can't tell when to be serious. However, even this flaw is something that anyone can look past, since the show itself is so enjoyable. \nTo recap, FMA:B is nothing short of a masterpiece. The story is touching and sends a meaningful message. The art is breathtaking, and makes the action scenes that much more awesome. The soundtrack is a masterpiece in itself, and the dub is critically acclaimed as one of the best dubs ever. All the characters have so much depth that it's impossible to hate a single character of this anime. Finally, the anime was just flat out enjoyable from start to finish, grabbing the viewers attention from episode 1 and becoming more and more interesting as the show progresses. Overall: 10/10"},

You may be thinking \"Another fanboy, better find a real review\", and well, maybe you're right, but I have to praise what deserves to be praised, and this certaninly does.\n Sure you can say the first episodes were a bit rushed, but wouldn't people still complain if they had slowed it down instead? For me the pacing of the story felt natural and that they did not need to waste the beginning of the series explaining the story since it is slowly explained as the anime progresses.\nThe Art - 10/10\nSometimes an anime can feel a little off when the art style does not please our eyes, even though the story is actually good, but this is definitely not the case. The art style is really enjoyable and I just loved those round faces!\nThe fight scene, don't even get me started! The animation is gorgeous and Bones sure knows how to deliver well-animated fights with amazing angles and details that really make the watcher enjoy what the're watching.\nThe Sound - 10/10\nI can tell you this: I have every opening on my cellphone and I regularly listen to the ending songs and background music when I feel like listening to those serene and beautiful soundtracks or the epic songs from the  several fight scenes. The voice actors did an amazing job with every single character, and even though I did not watch the dubbed version, I did watch a couple of bits on youtube, and it sounded pretty well too. I don't think there's much else to say here, top notch as always.\nThe characters - 10/10\nThe second best thing about Fullmetal Alchemist is it's characters. Every single character has a completely different personality and exceptional development, each one having their different reasons to act the way they do.\nEven the villains are awesome, with their dark stories and troubled personalities that make our heros' journey be long and troublesome. It also has the best main villain of all time from any anime I've seen so far, that's a +1 right there.\nEnjoyment - In case it's not obvious by now, 10/10\nI enjoyed every single episode from this amazing series which left me sitting on the edge of my seat with all the plot-twists and cliffhangers that followed the previous one, that with the awesome animation quality by Bones, beautiful soundtracks and lots of relatable characters with funny, troubled, brave and heartwarming personalities.\nOverall - 10/10\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was an amazing experience that managed to surpass it's other version's \"awesomness\" and show us what anime truly is about, and that's how it managed to reach my #1 spot, truly a masterpiece that won't be forgotten anytime soon, at least by me it won't. :)\n\n"},

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMAB) is not exactly like them. It is not the usual 'go on an adventure' type with dozens of episodes and fight scenes that all look the same. FMAB is more story-oriented and tactical.\nFirst, the story is very well wtitten and everything is properly planned out and coincides with each other bringing out every element in the right manner at the right time. The concept is really good with the\n          \n        right blend of fantasy and reality.\nAlthough the brothers are the focus of the show, each and every character has a role to play and help develop the story accordingly and develop themselves as well. This keeps the viewers alive to every character.\nThe soundtracks are soo cool. You would love atleast 4 of 'em.\nI am not bothered by animation/art, but it is really good though.\nI also liked the fact that there were some great statements and quotes about life, you know.\nNot to mention, FMAB is one hilarious anime!! Then a little bit of drama and a little bit of a romance here and there gives it a proper outfit. I could recommend any type of person to watch this anime. For me it has become one of the classics\nI saw this show when I was small and liked it instantly. Because I didn't see it properly I saw it again, and boy, was I glad I did! I loved every bit of it. Now I wouldn't say it doesn't have flaws, but why be a nit-picker when it is so enjoyable. No anime is perfect to everyone's mark afterall, eh\n        "},

I loved it. It was funny, It was sad. It had a little romance, and a lot of humor and a heluva lot of action.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=103,  ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    To this day my writing is influenced by Fullmetal Alchemist. I read the manga about ten years ago, but I still remember most of the characters by name. The author's vision and its execution were not without flaws, but the overall end result was sheer brilliance. The themes of loss, sacrifice and transformation are seamlessly integrated into the plot and character backstories.\nWhat makes this story exceptional is how universal its subject matters are. Everybody goes through growing pains, but in the case of the Elric brothers Edward and Alphonse, their transition into adulthood is nothing short of hardcore. The boys lost their mother, who they\n          \n        literally tried resurrecting, but in addition to failing miserably with the alchemical ritual, Edward lost two limbs and Alphonse his entire body. Turns out, despite the sheer magical potential of alchemy, it can't be used to bring people back to life.\nThere's a good reason why Fullmetal Alchemist has few peers. A story like this is impossible to create unless you've survived fucked up shit, possess the social support and intelligence to make sense of it and have the skills as a storyteller to convey those experiences. The author clearly thinks ill of shortcuts to personal growth (miracle cures, religion, etc.), evidenced by the first episode alone.\nIt seems obvious to point out the inspiration to this series is human darkness - even ethnic genocide makes it into the plot. It's astonishing how deep Fullmetal Alchemist goes with its harrowing concepts, yet rarely feels depressing. The characters talk about their emotions, then keep pushing forward, make new allies and grow as people. To be fair though, they don't actually get many chances to lament their misery, because the intense plot constantly whips them forward.\nThe main mysteries involving the plot are discovered shortly into the series, but the bad guys quickly clean house and cover everything up. This killing creates an incredible tension that sets the pace for the entire rest of the series. Not only that, but on many occasions the episode's cliffhanger is just brutal, reminiscent of Attack on Titan. Friendly advice: DON'T watch this series before bed, make the time to binge it!\nThe cast of characters is varied in genders, ages and body types. Their designs are focused and simplistic, though not without depth. Unlike how females are often drawn in anime, in Fullmetal Alchemist they look nice, but not overtly sexualized. There's also just about no fanservice. Even some of the evil characters are surprisingly humane, which indicates the author's ability for deep empathy. That's a real feat, considering the eyes she has for true darkness.\n        "},

Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric are raised by their mother Trisha in the remote village of Risembool. Their father Hohenheim, a noted and very gifted alchemist, abandoned his family while the boys were still young, and while in Trisha's care they began to show an affinity for alchemy. However, when Trisha died of\n          \n        a lingering illness, they were cared for by their best friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako. The boys traveled the world to advance their alchemic training under Izumi Curtis. Upon returning home, the two decide to try to bring their mother back to life with alchemy. However, human transmutation is a taboo, as it is impossible to do so properly. In the failed transmutation that results, Al's body is completely obliterated and Ed loses his left leg. In a last ditch attempt to keep his brother alive, Ed sacrifices his right arm to bring Al's soul back and houses it in a nearby suit of armor. After Edward receives automail prosthetics from Winry and Pinako, the brothers decide to burn their childhood home down (symbolizing their determination and decision of \"no turning back\") and head to the capital city to become government sanctioned State Alchemists. After passing the exam, Edward is dubbed the \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" by the State Military, and the brothers begin their quest to discover the nature of the fabled Philosopher's Stone, under the direction of Colonel Roy Mustang. Along the way, they discover a deep government conspiracy to hide the true nature of the Philosopher's Stone that involves the homonculi, the alkahestrists of the neighboring nation of Xing, the scarred man from the war-torn nation of Ishbal, and their own father's past.\nsound(10/10)\nthe sound before fight is so great.The ending and opening theme songs were also great.The respective opening and ending themes for the first 14 episodes are \"Again\" by Yui, and \"Uso\" (嘘?, lit. \"Lie\") by Sid.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=76,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood was released in 2009 and it is a remake of the FullMetal Alchemist, where the story takes another path and twist from the original. Brotherhood is considered to be better than the original from most of its viewers.The whole animation has deep meanings as its designed based on facts and different cultures, Its not just a random put-together. It has a good way of transmitting the anime's emotions such as comedy style and drama, and will definitely make you laugh sometimes , and other times feel sad or even cry.\nThe anime consist of 64 episodes which by my opinion is a very\n          \n        good amount that doesnt tire you and its not too short either. There are also some stand-alone side stories: Blind Alchemist, Simple People and Tales of the Master.\nGraphics: The graphics on this animation are much improved than its predecessor. The graphics engine changed and if you watch this animation on more than 720 p you are gonna love it! The movement is smooth and the physic in the anime are as realistic as they can considering its a fantasy world with super extra special effects! It has Naturalistic colors which will not make your eyes hurt and the design of things around is pretty interesting as well. For an anime released in 2009 it has awesome details. Characters are well designed and give you the exact face expressions depending on the situation.\nArt: The openings and the ending of the series are awesome as they have great music and awesome design. As every anime openings of course they are kinda spoily as they show things from the series that have not happened yet. The anime has awesome soundtracks in general where they fit perfectly on the situation.\nPlot: We are in a world where in contrary with ours the people can apply Alchemy! Alchemy is the science where you can take matter , Understand it , dissolve it and then put it back together in something different. All people there can do it pretty much , at least people that are practising the art. Out protagonist tried to follow a forbidden alchemy type when their mother passed away. Wanting to bring their mother back they applied what can be said as human alchemy. The process backfired and Edward lost his leg while his little brother lost his whole body. Edward not knowing what to do he sacrificed his arm to tie his brother soul on an iron armor. After they survived Edward had surgery to apply prosthetic parts and his brother remained as an armor. Now Edward applies to work for the military thinking that he has a chance to find a way to discover the Philosophers Stone, a legendary ingredient which will help him and his brother recover their bodies. The questions are so many that they dont know where to start looking. What are the creatures called homunculus that have the name of the seven sins? What is their connection with the Stone and the way to immortality? Will the two brother stay together until the end or will the guilt consume them?\nIn General: The plot is very well made and i can tell you that it is so complete that it doesn't let you any holes or blanks when the anime ends. It is deeply mysterious and very moving in such ways that it will definitely make you cry! The plot doesn't only move around the protagonists as all characters in the series are interesting and have an awesome story. \nIn Depth Details: The whole world in the animation seems to be Germanized as for starters there is a Fuhrer in the anime. The state alchemists are called dogs of the military and in general the story is very militarized. There is this extermination of the Ishval where i can connect it with gypsies due to their lifestyle , cultural similarities and the fact that Germany killed about 1 million Romans(gypsies) during the war and also the war on multiple fronts. There is also an obsession with the occult in the high ranking members. If you have watched the original FullMetal Alchemist you will see that at the end of the series and the movie, it takes place in Germany 1923 on hitler's age  where the German Nazis are looking for power to invade other countries.\nAccording to the writer: Arakawa has stated she didn't use any specific countries or cultures to create Amestris, but rather a combination of several European countries from several different periods between the 17th and 19th centuries and, more specifically, the changes that occurred in the Western Europe during the Industrial Revolution (with a greater inspiration in England). According to her, however, there's no implied relation or comparison to any specific country, time, or government.\n        "},

But for me is something more important than that, so let me try this again…\nFMA: Brotherhood THE FIRST anime show I ever watched.\nLet me be honest with all of you, I started watching anime 3 years ago –and manga a few months ago-, so in all honesty I am a newbie, but since the start –my start- I’ve been able to watch some of the most fantastic histories/shows of my life, leaving aside\n          \n        “real” –and by real I mean with actors in flesh and blood- shows like: Twin Peaks, 24, Lost and others.\nI am lucky to have friends that have immersed themselves since children’s in the anime world, an those friends showed me an amazing way to start watching anime, and amazingly, now I’m doing this  review for a friend of mine –and of course all those- that want’s to start watching anime.\nSince the first time I started watching FMA: Brotherhood I heard very mixed reviews. Some call this one a masterpiece, some others call it a shameful thing in comparison with 2003-2004 FMA version.  But for me both versions are amazing, but I hold dear this version a little bit more for being my first anime show.\nFMA: Brotherhood is one of those “weird” anime that has everything and still their foundation holds perfectly because all the plots, all the drama, all the fights and scenes are “one for all and all for one” or in the words of the joker “They complete each other”.\nSo let us begin –finally- this review.\n\n-STORY: 10-\nTo put it bluntly the story is neither great nor good. It’s fantastic, original –word that I don’t use very often- amazingly developed, in other words an EPIC MATERPIECE.\nFMA: Brotherhood attempts –very closely- to follow the line designed in the original manga as opposed in the original Show. \nIt’s a story of friendship, of brotherhood, of moments filled with happiness and saddens, of regrets and treasured memories it has EVERYTHING.\nAnd it has one of the most –or probably- the most AMAZING ending of them all.\n\n-ART: 10- \nIn all honesty “huge pockets” will always save everything, whether a movie, a TV SHOWS or an anime.\nIt’s easy to see that the team that made “FMA: Brotherhood” a reality had a very good budget just by looking at the art. But let’s not “mess” with the amazing work made by the ART Designers of this show, for it doesn’t matter what we are talking about –in the art department- it is easy on the eyes. So beautiful and inspiring.\nThe characters are probably my favorite part/design in an anime that was made perfectly.\n\n -SOUND: 10-\nLet me tell you this, FMA: Brotherhood soundtrack is the first soundtrack I downloaded -from an anime- it’s mesmerizing, it’s perfect.\nIf I remember correctly no other anime has made me sing their main theme: “Again” by “YUI” or a song like “Lapis Philosophorum”.\nAnd most importantly it doesn’t matter if you watch the anime subbed or dubbed, it’s amazing.\nIt’s a soundtrack that is memorable, a soundtrack that can change the mood of the moment by itself without the need of words nor actions.\n\n-CHARACTER: 10-\nTo call anything in this show “the jewel of the crown” is honestly a waste of time after all, the wholeness of the show IS THE “jewel of the crown”. But I WILL waste my time by naming the CHARACTERS of this show THE “jewels of the crown”.\nEvery single character is memorable and distinguishable. All of them are entertaining and most importantly everyone shines on their own way. Ed in all honesty is one of my favorite characters of all time, Roy Mustang is a character filled with life… wait EVERY SINGLE one is filled with life, something that isn’t easy to make, they shine whether individually or in a group. Enough said.\n-ENJOYMENT & OVERALL: 10-\nThis is one of those shows that everything is perfect.\nIt’s a masterpiece, an anime worthy of your attention and love.\nAs I stated before “most epic anime show of all history… in other words THE masterpiece.”\nThat line is enough to describe this show.\n Thank you for reading.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=88,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Okay, so this is only my third review at this point, meaning that my reviewing pants are still a little tight and don't cup the goods just right yet, but I'm a firm advocate of sink or swim and, this being a review of one of the most popular [and currently highest rated] shows on MAL, I figure that I'll either be met with wild success or consigned to the murky depths of obscurity.\nRight, so I'd like to go into this saying that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a shining beacon of hope amongst the fetid mire of what counts for shounen today. My own personal\n          \n        biases aside, I have never seen an anime that so completely earned its rating of 10 by being so consistently competent in just about every category. The merits of its predecessor, Fullmetal Alchemist, may be widely disputed, but there is no doubt that Brotherhood is one of the best anime that I've had the pleasure of watching and arguably the most well rounded shounen out there. Now, being the pleb that I am, I've never actually read the Fullmetal Alchemist manga, and therefore cannot attest to how closely the show follows it, but those of you who watched the original will find that, up to a certain point, it treads pretty much the same ground as its predecessor; beyond that point, the two stories diverge wildly with the introduction of the neighboring country of Xing [China, basically] and the squinty-eyed badasses that hail from it. On an off note, I always thought it odd that, in most anime, the Japanese characters look for all the world like young white teenagers, but when you introduce a Chinese guy, it's all \"harrows\" and squinty-eyes from there.  At any rate, the Xingese characters really put the militaristic regime of Amestris [the setting of most of the story] into perspective, but I'll get to them later.\nThe story itself is excellently paced, chronicling the Elric Brothers' journey to get their bodies back and their subsequent discoveries about the nature of alchemy itself. This sets the perfect premise for an exciting story that explores the consequences of human transmutation and the myriad of other complex moral issues presented by something such as alchemy. It also [frequently] touches on the physical and emotional repercussions of war, and the use of alchemists as a military asset, but my favorite part of the story is perhaps that it finally elucidates on Houenheim, the boys' father, who was an enigmatic figure throughout the entirety of the original, and his curious relation to the show's behind-the-scenes antagonist [of whom, by the way, is far more interesting than the original's]. I would elaborate more on the story itself, but I'll abstain from it for fear of spoiling any plot twists or revelations, of which there are many. The only real complaints that I have are that FMA:B suffered once or twice from your typical stilted anime dialogue and odd anime morality. This isn't to say that the characters weren't all consistent and believable in their decision making, they really were,  but there was one point where a character, in an incredibly justified fit of rage, was about to kill someone who clearly deserved to die [that he'd been looking for throughout the whole show in fact], but was stopped. Why? Because afterwards he \"wouldn't be the same.\" I imagine not; he'd probably have quite a load off his chest and walk with a little more skip in his step in my opinion, but everyone else may as well have been quoting Star Wars, what with their \"if you strike him down in anger, then you’ll give in to it yourself,” as though avenging countless lives is paramount to joining the Dark Side. I'd say that scene was absolutely confusing, but it actually contributed to an interesting bit of characterization for one of the bad guys; and besides, only a Sith deals in absolutes. \nAnother [in fact, the only other] gripe that I had was with how they treated the beginning, which, as I mentioned before, is roughly the same as the original's [which was quite dark], except for some reason they thought it’d be a good idea to throw more Cartoon Faces in there. I mean, I understand throwing in a little humor for the sake of levity when things are getting too grim, but when a girl is contemplating murder after being coerced with promises of reuniting with her deceased boyfriend, having her aim at the wrong person just to throw in another \"haha, Ed is short\" joke doesn't quite cut it. Not to mention that one of the times Al went into \"cartoon\" mode during a funny scene it struck me that he looked an awful lot like a big grey condom, a thought which I just couldn't shake off for the rest of the show. Aside from that, the story is pretty much flawless.\nInterestingly enough, while Ed and Al are obviously the main duo, what with them being featured prominently on the box art, they can't really be said to be the only main characters. Brotherhood also follows a fairly sizable cast of interesting characters, showing no particular favor to any one of them, instead opting to diligently flesh out each and every one of their individual journeys; including among them an ambitious military officer's campaign to root out dangerous enemies on the inside and rise among the ranks of his fellow soldiers to the esteemed title of Fuhrer [which I understand sounds suspicious to anyone post 1945, but despite obvious comparisons, Amestris isn't Nazi Germany], to the survivor of a domestic genocide [okay... maybe it is] and his quest for vengeance, with a whole array of compelling characters in between. \nWhile I'm on the topic of characters: if you were to ask me which of those  were my favorite, I'd be a genuine loss; every one of them is consistent and interesting, and they compose what is certainly one of my favorite casts in anime or media in general. I must, however, award special merit to a few: King Bradley, for perfectly encapsulating all that is man; fearless, pertinacious, and unrepentant. Riza Hawkeye and Roy Mustang, for being the most well-rounded female character and the most relatable badass respectively. Houenheim, for having a beard worthy of Rider himself, and...\nActually, you know what? Never mind, all of them were amazing. Not to mention that FMA:B sports the biggest cast of female badasses that I've seen since Black Lagoon. A few characters are necessary to mention however, such as the new Xingese characters, Ling Yao [and his guards Lan Fan and Fuu], and Shao May [possibly one of the most refreshingly competent kids I've seen in anime], who are introduced around the time that Brotherhood starts coming into its own, and add a lot of supplementary lore about the world surrounding Amestris; also the Homunculi, because I really enjoyed how most of their deaths seemed to be accompanied by some underlying theme that corresponded to their respective traits. While there is so much to love, the thing that I find most impressive about the characters is that seemingly all of them are relevant. Honestly. I can't tell you how many characters were introduced that I immediately pegged as throwaways, but come the end of the show there they are, doing things. Important things. No single character can be considered the product of bad writing and they all experience growth and development in their respective arcs, oftentimes as a result of their novel interactions with the rest of the cast. By the way, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the battles, this being a shounen and all. The animation is top notch for the fights this time around and you can tell that the development team went all out on each and every one; this show sports some of the most well animated fighting that I've seen. Not to mention that the action is pretty clever, and revolves around the use of tactics as opposed to power levels, meaning that the winner of any one confrontation was entirely circumstantial and therefore appropriately suspenseful. Every encounter is fast paced and exhilarating, and thankfully so, because there are plenty of them.\nLastly, the music and voice acting are superb. I personally watched Brotherhood dubbed, and would highly recommend it myself, because how often do you get to enjoy a genuinely outstanding dub? I tried the sub as well and found the voice acting similarly inspired; I really only chose the dub for the sheer novelty of actually getting to listen to a competent English cast. Each voice actor did an amazing job and matched their character perfectly. Ed and Al were voiced splendidly, easily conveying an entire range of emotions, Bradley was a warm family man and a menacing leader in the same breath, you could hear Roy's pain at his past molded into fuel for his ambition for the future, and of course, I could listen to Alex Louis Armstrong FOR GENERATIONS! The music was likewise impressive; this was actually one of few anime where I listened to every single opening song, every time. The OST as a whole was grand and, though some were perhaps initially overused, I never once found the BGM to be jarring or unfitting to the scene. Brotherhood also knows when to use silence; a valuable skill that many shows haven't quite gotten the hang of. Absolutely no qualms in the audio department.\nAll in all, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a breath of fresh air in a stagnant pool of trite shounen anime; the story is captivating, the fights are thrilling, and the characterization is exemplary. Sure it may have its flaws, like that stupid “no confirmation of [romantic] feelings [to each other] until the very end” thing that anime does, but that’s a minor thing when compared to the tour de force of competency that is Brotherhood. There’s a reason that it’s resting comfortably at #1 after all."},

Whilst not being the first anime i ever watched, (dragon ball z being the first, followed by Nartuo (which i personally never really liked), it was the first anime that i completed fully. So, to my surprise, in 2010, after about a 3 year break from anime, when i came across the title Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, i was surprised that\n          \n        the story wasn't over yet, (i never had access to the internet until the age of 13, this being in 2010, and the library where i got my manga didn't have the complete volumes of Fullmetal), yet i decided to ignore it, only until recently i decided to watch it, due to my passion for anime coming back in 2013, and i gotta say, every moment, every minute was absolutely astonishing and to this day Fullmetal Alchemist will always have a special place in my heart and will always be my favorite anime. :3\nStory: The story of FMA:B is basically the tale of 2 brothers, Ed and Al, who after performing a forbidding type of Alchemy called  Human Transportation to bring their dead mother back to life end-up not only failing to bring their mother back to life but also sacrificing their bodies, Ed losing his arm and leg, whilst his brother AL is locked to a suit of armor. The story of Fullmetal Alchemist is rich, full of brilliant themes and ideas that at times can be absolute tear-jerkers, to dark undertones, such as genocide, corruption, lust, greed, envy and wrath. The whole story is essentially a journey to reclaim what has been lost and a chance at redemption (for example ED AND AL trying to re-gain their lost limbs). Everything about the plot to full-metal is almost flawless, the ending is absolutely spectacular leaving absolutely no plot holes. \nArt: the art is simplistic, yet captivating. I absolutely loved the art style, i found it very re-refreshing and the character designs where amazing, all handled by my personal favorite animation company BONES.\nSound: The music in Fullmetal is absolutely brilliant, especially the opening and closing songs. All music does a fantastic job at showing the themes and the underlining feel of the show, a chance of redemption and to find what has been lost. Over the Dub and the Sub, for fullmetal, i would have to go with the DUB, every performance is top-notch, not one bad bit of dialog, yet you can never go wrong for the 2, sub and dub, both are top-notch. \nCharacters: i refuse to explain how incredible they are, watch it, for the love of god, watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.\nEnjoyment: I gave the anime a goddamn 10/10, i love almost everything about it.\nOverall: WATCH IT, READ IT, BUY IT, worth all of your money.\n(compared to the original i believe they are both amazing peaces f work that must be seen) \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=70,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    	One thing I distinctly remember about the 12 year old me was a fear of becoming a mega nerd who watched anime. I enjoyed video games but didn’t want to plunge headlong into the void I saw before me. Well, times changed and I found myself watching my first anime at a college friend’s behest. In 2011 I found myself entranced with the deep and exciting world of Fullmetal Alchemist and the story of the two Elric brothers as they journeyed to redeem themselves. The ending to that first series, however, was a letdown that shook my good impressions of the strong opening. That opinion\n          \n        remains to this day.\n	A few months later I recounted my experiences to my friend and, to my surprise, he replied that a retelling of the series had recently finished which remained faithful to the source material. After a few months, I sat down on Netflix and watched Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The whole time I wondered: can the series be better than the original? Could the already great relationship I encountered between the two brothers be deepened? \nStory:	\nFirst, I’d like to explain the story. Two brothers, Edward and his younger brother Alphonse Elric, live in the mysterious land of Amestris where Alchemy is a science practiced by those gifted with this strange ability. The Elric brothers grow up in their hometown with their childhood friend Winry and their mother until a plague comes through the area. Tragically, their mother passes away in the epidemic but Edward and Alphonse resolve to see their mother’s smile once more. They study from books their absent father left behind and attempt to do the forbidden: bring the dead to life. Needless to say the attempt turns horribly wrong and the series then focuses on the siblings trying to return themselves back to normal. \nWhat separates Brotherhood from its original 2003 counterpart is not really apparent at first. The brothers commit the same horrible act and what immediately follows is eerily similar. When the story reaches Dublith, however, Brotherhood begins to tell a new story. The result, I am delighted to say, is an exciting epic that twists and turns throughout the whole of the mythical world Hiromu Arakawa has laid out for us. The purpose for which the two brothers fight becomes deeper and deeper without ever losing sight of what originally drove the two to join the fight in the first place; and the resolve of the Elric brothers is pushed to the limit in ways you would never think possible. The ending is especially epic as the underlying philosophy of the show comes to light. It’s amazing to see a show that does this well in the end and Brotherhood deserves every ounce of praise it gets for its story\nSadly, it would be a lie to claim this story is perfectly told. Both the very beginning and middle section of the series suffer from pacing issues. To be frank, the beginning is often criticized for the choice to gloss over material covered in the 2003 counterpart.  While all the material is there, you might be wishing for just a little more explanation before the show continues at full speed. The middle section of the anime also suffers from a pacing issue, but this time it’s too slow. While it was nice to take a breather from the action immediately preceding this section, Brotherhood falters as it introduces the final set of characters that will join in the epic climax. \n24/25\nCharacters:\nProbably the most remarkable aspect of the original Fullmetal Alchemist series back in 2003 was the goofy and touching bond between the two brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric. The rapid back and forth between the two served as an ideal backdrop to explore the two brothers’ personalities. Fortunately this bond was not only kept with the new series, but taken to even higher heights. Seeing the two in action was truly a delight. \nOne of the exciting things about Brotherhood was a truly diverse cast with characters that fairly consistently avoided the cardboard character models that are so easy to fall into. Minor characters that stand out include Yoki, Maes Hughes, and of course Lust. But what makes the series memorable is the diverse cast of characters with their own motivations. Roy Mustang and Riza Hawkeye are trying to atone for the crimes of the Ishvallan war of extermination and build a better world no matter what the cost. General Armstrong seeks to make Amestris as strong as it can possibly be and fights to make it so. And even the enemies have motivations that sum up to more than a simple “we must stop the main protagonists at all costs.” Brotherhood massively succeeds in making the story engaging through its exciting cast, and I feel as if the story is as wonderful as it is because of the well-developed characters in this series.       \n24/25\nAnimation:\nOf course no animated series can exist without the medium of animation to carry facial expressions and convey action. To this respect, Brotherhood improves upon the solid foundations left by the 2003 series and the manga.  I particularly enjoy the character designs, but animation experts have raved about the fantastic fight scenes the series boasts. One animator, Yoshimichi Kameda, has received extensive praise for his touches and innovations in the Sakuga of several major fight scenes. Aside from that there are a few instances where the animation gets a little derpy and the chibi animation can sometimes interfere with the overall gravity of the plot; but I find it refreshing that a series so epic takes a small breather every now and then.\n16/17.5\nSound:\nWith regards to the overall sound of the show, I felt as if there was some solid work put in on the part of Akira Senju. Unfortunately, the music of the series does begin to grind on you as the show reaches the climatic final scenes. This is alleviated somewhat by the execution of the music in the show as it never overpowers the quietest moments and never is lost even in the thick of combat. One major plus in my book is the work done by Funimation in their Dub of the show. Vic Mignogna delivers again in his reprise of Edward Elric and the rest of the English cast is, for the most part, quite solid. As I am not a native speaker of Japanese I generally prefer watching the Dub when I can so I am able to more effectively judge the quality of the voice acting; and the English cast is phenomenal. If I had to comment on the original voice acting performed in Japanese I would remark that the Voice actor for Edward sounds much younger than an American 15 year old would sound… Haters gonna hate.		\n14/17.5\nAccessibility:\nFinally, I would be negligent to recommend or condemn this series without mentioning the appropriateness of the series to all ages. While I do feel as if the series is a masterfully told story, there are elements that prohibit me from recommending this adventure to all. Most notably the dark one and violence make this series a no go for anyone under the age of 15. If you doubt me watch episode 4 and tell me it isn’t dark. Also it seems like every shonen series has an uncontrollable urge to throw in a tub scene with the main love interest. Obviously this isn’t family friendly. While complete nudity is not an issue, this series is not guitless when it comes to the regrettable trend of fanservice and innuendo. 	\n4/5\nEnjoyment factor:\nI loved Brotherhood… Enough said, and seeing as it tells a complete story that examines and plays out different philosophies as part of its intricate design, it seems as if Brotherhood will continue to be my most enjoyable TV experience for a long time.\n10/10\nMany people have lauded Brotherhood since its completion and I am happy to include myself in their number. The sheer glory of the ending is a masterpiece that needs to be seen to believe, though the barrier of entry regrettably limits the audience of the series. For these reasons I rate Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood with a score of 92 out of 100 and grade the series as a Diamond rated show. Brotherhood is a monument to anime done well, and is a testament to a story told superbly. The combination of quality animation and well developed characters provide the perfect backdrop to a tale of two brothers. A tale where redemption is just beyond their reach. "},

I remember the first time I watched it, I wanted to keep watching more to find out what happens, but I'll admit at first I did not enjoy it since there were many things I did not understand, but as I watched it again three years later, I enjoyed every bit of it. Following the manga closer than its 2003 counterpart, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is an example of how an action anime should be done.\nStory: 9/10\nThe story is one of the\n          \n        better written stories in anime. It follows through with its consistency, its somewhat original, and has you intrigued all the way through. There's a major buildup to the final villain of the series, and the buildup pays off quite well. The story has its share of twists and many times, the show is unpredictable at times, which is always a good thing. There are times when the series gets too action-heavy, though and it seems to drag a little. Nothing too bad. I also thought that the beginning episodes with the deaths of certain characters were rushed in comparison to the first series. There's a lot of suspension of disbelief moments in the action scenes as well, such as people losing gallons of blood but still somehow alive or some moves performed by characters. And the whole \"military is secretly evil\" plotline is a bit cliched if you ask me. Other than that, the story is really well-done, I believe.\nArt: 10/10\nWhat more can I say? The art direction is amazing. The detailed character drawings, the animation in the fight scenes, the drawings in comedic and depressing scenes. I'd say that the artwork fits the show's dark story.\nSound: 10/10\nOh man, I could go on and on about this. The soundtrack of this series is damn amazing. In fact, I am listening to it as I'm writing this review. Every soundtrack is beautifully orchestrated, and fits each scene well. They are a joy to listen to while watching the show, as well as when doing other activities. The openings and endings chosen for the show are also excellent. \nCharacter: 10/10\nEach and every character in this series is interesting and memorable. Even someone as useless as Yoki becomes useful. All of them go through development and you truly feel for what the characters are going through. I can definitely say that these characters were integrated into the story extremely well.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nWith the copious amounts of action (Wrath and Pride!!), the great story, and the lovable characters, this show is nothing but enjoyment. I'd recommend it to anyone: anime lover or not.\nOverall 10/10\nDon't miss out on this one. There's a reason as to why this anime is the number one ranked on MAL.\n        "},

The main rule of this anime is of Equivalent Exchange; To gain, something of equal value must be lost.\nSo, what's the Story?\nThe story follows brothers Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric in a journey to find a mythical gem known as the Philosophers Stone in order to bend the laws of alchemy and receive the bodies they lost trying to bring back their mother after her death at the hands on an illness. That is the basics, though the second half of the anime is\n          \n        very different and the story becomes a lot more serious and the entire tone goes from a selfish journey for their own benefit and turns into a massive story that is absolutely fantastic. \nThe story of the anime, as a whole, was clear and enjoyable, and kept the overall feeling of the anime constant, always adding suspense, comedy, sadness, and any emotion possible.\nThe characters are amazing. From main characters like Edward, to background characters, each is given a motive, story and enough time to actually create a connection. Every character was understandable and somewhat likable or relatable.\nThe sub and the dub are both amazing, and the dub is one of the best ever for any anime, every character's voice is great, well used and memorable. Not a single voice sounds wrong. Every character sounds exactly like you'd expect them to and it makes the entire anime a lot easier to watch as well as a lot more enjoyable, creating a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. \nThe animation style is incredible, fluent and beautiful. It works perfectly, and somehow they use the same animation style effectively no matter what emotion they are attempting to convey. Comedy. seriousness and sorrow are all presented fantastically\nThis anime is easily one of my all time favourite anime, and I have yet to meet someone who genuinely dislikes it. It's worth a shot, and I know you'll fall in love with it, just like I did. Watch it all and there will definitely be a least one character you love and at least one part of the story you will always remember. \n        "},

The anime is sure to give you a taste of some fine exitement and suspense.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=83,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Have you ever gotten that feeling of overwhelming sadness once you finish an anime/manga because you know there will never be another one like it in its genre? That was the feeling I got when I finished Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\nAfter the controversy of the first Fullmetal Alchemist anime deviating greatly from the manga, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was created as a completely faithful adaptation of the manga. Despite being a shounen series, Brotherhood adopts a unique, more mature approach to action shounen anime while still retaining the basic qualities of the genre.\nThe series takes place in a small, but powerful country called Amestris that mirrors Nazi\n          \n        Germany. Amestris is a militaristic totalitarian country in which its most powerful figure (well, sorta) is the head of the military, addressed as Führer. There are many other historical references, including imperialistic desires, trench warfare, and an event similar to the Holocaust, and they help us to understand the situation Amestris is in at the start of the series.\nThe story follows the journey of teenage alchemists Edward and Alphonse Elric, brothers determined to get back their original bodies after a deadly accident following a failed Human Transmutation. As they try to find the legendary Philosopher’s Stone, an all-powerful item that can purportedly return them to their bodies, it becomes apparent that this mysterious object is tied in to every single conflict Amestris has been in. Unlike other shounens’ plots, which are tailored to maximize fighting, FMA’s plot is intriguing and full of genuine suspense. At its core though, the series is an endearing story about the resilient bond between two brothers who’ll never give up until they achieve their goal, despite seemingly impossible odds and obstructing obstacles.\nIn the series, alchemy is a blend of supernaturalism and chemistry that essentially takes an object and changes or transmutes it into a different object. A highly practical ability, alchemy can be used for medical purposes, fighting, building, etc. As an aspiring science major, this is one part of the series that really impressed me. For instance, there is a scene where Ed is forced to fight a character that can shield his body with diamond, one of the hardest substances on earth. After realizing the makeup of the shield, Ed transmutes the diamond into graphite (both are allotropes of carbon), a much more brittle substance. All the carbon atoms were still present, but now they were rearranged to weaken the shield. The incorporation of chemistry gives the fights so many possibilities. The Law of Conservation of Mass is somewhat applied to alchemy in the concept called Equivalent Exchange. Whatever the amount you use is the amount you receive. Of course, one of the powers of the Philosopher’s Stone is the ability to defy this rule of Equivalent Exchange, a reason why it is so coveted.\nMuch of the fighting in this series is relegated to close combat (until the final battle). Usually, the combatants are armed with some type of weapon, or if they’re alchemists, they can also transmute projectiles. But sometimes, the fights are as simple as hand to hand combat. Few people have truly unique abilities, especially since most fighting alchemists have similar abilities and the normal people can’t use any supernatural abilities anyway, so you won’t see crazy destructive powers like those of Naruto or Bleach. However, don’t misconstrue the fights to be any less exciting. The action is just as exhilarating, and with the inclusion of alchemy, we often see incredible environmental manipulation. Strategy is important, so the alchemic principle of understanding is sometimes crucial in fights. However, as a shounen that is more plot-driven than most, some of the fights are rather one-sided. After all, fights are supposed to be decided quickly, not take up several episodes and waste our times. Many of the fights serve to advance the plot, so more than anything, we see character development and learn more about the events preceding the series during these fights.\nThe characters are easily the best part of the series. There are many of them, and they all serve specific roles in the series. The most important ones are given fleshed-out backstories, and through these, we learn about their unique personalities, values, and internal conflicts, as well as get a sense of what exactly happened to lead up to the actual events of the series. Each character has some sort of goal that they hope to achieve, be it a return to a previous life, revenge, becoming the next Führer, or achieving immortality. The main antagonists of the series are the Homunculus, an immortal group of near-invincible creatures with human exteriors. There are seven of them, each one representing one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and much of their personalities and goals are based upon their respective sins. Their mysterious “Father” is the one who created them. These characters are far from one-dimensional. Their psychological conflicts and emotional backgrounds really help you empathize with them. In fact, Fullmetal Alchemist has spawned a number of my favorite characters.\nNow, despite all the praise I’ve given to Brotherhood, it does have a few setbacks, although whether these can be called setbacks depends on the viewer. The show often likes to resort to light-hearted slapstick comedy typical of a shounen series. Accompanying this is the occasional use of the chibi style of art. Some people may find this aggravating, although I personally have no problem with it. Also, the pacing of the series is somewhat inconsistent. Initially, the series moves rather quickly, resolving conflicts in only one or two episodes. At times, this gave the series an episodic feel. However, the pacing becomes much more streamlined towards the middle. Towards the latter part of the series, the pacing slows down considerably, and the final arc pretty much occurs within the span of a few hours. Again though, I found no problem with this personally, and the way the show was paced at different parts worked well with the occurrences in the plot.\nThe music is very suitable for the atmosphere of the show, giving an eerie, serious, ethereal, heartwarming, tragic, or lively feel depending on the scene. It’s not exactly memorable though, but it works. All the OPs and EDs are fairly good as well. On the other hand, the voice acting is perfect for the characters, especially Ed’s voice. Emotions are flawlessly conveyed through the voice actors. The animation is also fantastic. The fight scenes are exciting and flow well. No choppy movements. Occasionally, the faces do look somewhat disfigured and disproportionate (often times Mustang’s), but other than that, the artwork is detailed and generally solid.\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was an amazing experience. Its world is so intricate, but gradually, everything is explained in full detail, and it truly is beautifully crafted.  This isn’t just another shounen anime. Its incorporation of political, religious, psychological, and philosophical elements and its focus on plot over fighting definitely make it a much more mature series than your typical shounen. At the same time, its slapstick comedy and grand fights are the reason for its shounen tag, but that’s not a bad thing. Also, this is the only action series that has invoked any serious emotion in me, showing that I actually cared about these characters. It is unfortunate to see it end, but all good things must eventually come to an end. This is a shounen that’s done right.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=82,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    People tell me that I am too old for Japanese cartoons (those people are specifically idiots that prefer to say cartoons rather than anime). Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood aired 5 years ago so it classifies as an old anime but get this, I am never going to be too old and too late to watch FMA: B. \nFor some reason, otaku members in MAL may or may not be tired of seeing reviews that has a score of ten in FMAB. To those who are sick of seeing reviews like this saying how awesome Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is, well you guys better get used\n          \n        to it. After all, this show is by far the most epic thing I have ever seen in my entire life and I’m not just saying that because I am a fandom of it. The moment I first watched it, I was completely addicted and it became my instant favorite. (You may want to skip the third paragraph because I went through a long way before watching FMA: B but if you are interested on the story, fine with me.)\nOkay, this anime was never my decision to watch and it comes with a whole journey of doubt. Last 2010, I was amazed after seeing Soul Eater and I became a huge fan of it. I used to go to this website called animecrazy.net (You guys may never heard of this website but it was removed some year ago or years ago) and it has this section called “Most Popular Anime of all time” and every time I view it I see Soul Eater at number 9 which makes me happy; however, as months pass, it goes to spot #13 and I was completely mad and to think the anime that beat Soul Eater was Fairy Tail and Full Metal Alchemist/Brotherhood. I had a huge grudge on those two shows so I promised that I will never betray Soul Eater (hardcore fan girl right?) but that assurance was broken until now. I watched shows that were really crappy before seeing Full Metal. For example, 12 anime shows that completely tell nothing but friendship and getting a boyfriend and some shows with potential but with plot holes and open endings. I never really felt so bored. Not even a single anime left me with an incredible impression for the reason that most of them never gave me a superb feeling like what SE handed me years ago. Until one day, I was watching Baccano! And saw a recommendation about Full Metal so I did it and broke my pledge. I deceived SE but I never thought that it was going to be my best decision EVER!\nFull Metal Alchemist has a great story because each arc has a connection with one another. The first arc is the goal of getting Al and Ed their bodies back. The second arc is the villain’s plan which I will not tell you because I am not going to be a spoiler. The third arc is a clan’s mission in finding immortality in order to save their culture. The fourth arc is the anti-hero’s plan of seeking revenge on the military. If you think that’s all, think again. There are more back stories, more characters to invade, more unexpected happenings and more development on every character’s relationship. What makes it unique is that it uses Alchemy which is an ancient part of Chemistry (which is being taught to students of our era). Alchemy for some people claims to be magic of some sort but believe it or not it helped produced Chemistry that we know of today. This show is mainly talking about alchemy and it made it look so damn good. Some people will think that it’s going to be a boring show because it talks about a philosophical science but it is more than that. There will be a unexplainably awesome adventure for you guys with comedy, drama (lots of it), action, and surprisingly, a little subtle romance. I give the plot an outstanding 10 because face it, Arakawa-sensei made a story like no other. It is unique, incomparable and marvelous in a million levels. Sure, people will think that I am exaggerating a bit and yes there are flaws in this anime like there are some cliché ticks; nevertheless, it is quite different because there are no fillers and Brotherhood is straight to the point, a little fast paced and of course, the episode that capped everything is undoubtedly superior and satisfactorily complied with my expectations and even surpassed it. \nAniplex and Funimation had become popular in every anime show. Both organizations never fails to amaze me with their techniques when it comes to graphics but I won’t lie, the art is just very good and it did its best for a 2009 show by depicting very iconic styles and motifs. The background can be a little simple like its lacking details and animation. The colors were just nicely done. They know when to make a vibrant scene and a when to put a shadowy effect. Everything was just balanced and pleasing. People may observe it as mediocre but it did a splendid job for the graphics. Considering how it has a more modern impact unlike the original 2003 FMA, it also has great animation schemes.\nOne of the best points in FMA: B is their OST or original soundtrack. Every anime that has Bones as their producer really has excellent music that you won’t absolutely ignore (take OHSHC, CB and SE for example). For the opening songs, my biggest recommendation and the song that I really liked is Yui’s Again. It has a rather lavishing drama and courage mixed into it. It has a dramatic entry at first but it has a catchy tone in the latter part of it. The third opening, Golden Time Lover is also convincing and fun to listen to because it has rock music and it is also upbeat and likable. The fourth opening is great too, Period by Chemistry has a slow and not too quick rhythm but it uses electric guitar as its main tune. The second opening is full hope and has more happiness into it. Rain is just too all over the place but the video that comes along with the song helps. It is good but it just wasn’t notable for me. The endings were just as grand as the OPs. The best among the rest is Miho Fukuhara’s Let it Out (which is better than Frozen’s Let it Go) because it is the song that never gets out of my head. It is very iconic and very dramatic. It made me cry so hard every time it plays with a very sad moment in FMA: B. I loved it so much and is willing to make it as my favorite Otaku song. Uso, Shunkan Sentimental, and Ray of Light were all good and aspiring to hear. The blend of RnB and Alternative Rock was splendid (am I right). For Tsunaida Te, I disliked it because of the rap that goes along with the piano it didn’t blend with the slow and steady melody. For the sound effects, some were quite repetitive but hey, that’s what makes it iconic and memorable. When it plays somewhere you’ll know that it is Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood’s soundtrack. The voice actors were flawless. They placed all the great emotions at the right time and the right place. Whether they need to be funny, sad, and emotionally fine they did it at the greatest quality as possible. Although, I am not fond of the English dub in many anime shows, FMA: B’s English dub was distinct. The Japanese dub is great too but the English dub was more hilarious. I was just a little concerned with Ed’s voice in the Japanese dub because Paku Romi is good at Edward’s younger voice but when Ed became a little older, she should’ve made her voice a little deeper but no sweat, she is a girl after all. In the English dub Vic Minogna’s voice was flexible at all costs. Kugimiya Rie and the English dub actors of Alphonse did an exceptional job (they were too many I can’t distinguish who was who). The others were awesome too making this anime lively and entertaining. \nCharacters are also one of the strongest potential of Brotherhood. Of course, Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric were a great main character duo. Both were entertaining and somehow have various personalities. Individually, they are different but both are awesome protagonists. The supporting casts were explicit from Roy Mustang to the villains. I didn’t hate any character in this anime. Each and every one of them was lovable and funny. Yeah, so some of them have the common personality like the pervert, the overly protective main character and the defenseless girl but somehow they are all fantastic when seen together and they also have unique characteristics. (Take Note: I mistook Edward as a girl and Al as a robot, I am so stupid, am I the only one though?)\nIf giving enjoyment an infinity I would've done it by now but sadly it’s only a ten. This anime has outstanding puns, dramatic parts, a little romance, overwhelming action scenes and an ending that no words could describe my feelings because it was the best one. (Thank you Arakawa!) FMA: B was the first shounen anime that made me cry. There were episodes that were just too intense that I never expected to shed a tear. The jokes were funny and were not corny. Yeah sure some of it was always shown but they place the jokes at the right time without confusing the person and making the viewers say “what the hell am I watching?” There weren’t too many ecchi scenes in Brotherhood because like I said it is pretty straightforward. Action scenes were not too dull. They preserved the specialness in every character’s strengths and weaknesses in order to give out their true power in the end. Romance? Well, I can't believe that it has one but don’t worry, the show doesn't focus much on the love story.  \nWith a great story line, lovable characters that you won’t forget, unmistakably exquisite music and sound effects, a different art and amusing parts there is no denying that you should really NOT miss FMA: B. I am not saying this because I am a fan, I am saying this because I am a victim of watching an extraordinary anime that never left my mind. I was thinking about this anime for like weeks now and there isn't a second or a minute that I never wait for the next episode. I will always admire this anime because of its strong capability to make a person learn about sacrifices and pain. Life is cruel but in the end, you’ll know that everyone needs to lose something to gain what you really want. Just like what Edward said, “A lesson without pain is meaningless” so you have to stand and endure it. You shouldn't miss Fullmetal but instead have the time to watch it and you will be captivated. It wasn't ranked as number one in MAL for no reason. Because of FMA: B, I finally learned to move on and keep moving forward. If you haven't watched it yet, you will lose half of your life and your limbs. "},

In the first version (Fullmetal Alchemist), the first half of the series is really good. The fight between Edward Elric and Roy Mustang & the State Alchemist test taken by Edward Elric are notable ones. In second half, the story takes lots of twists and turns and I find it is not as impressive as the first half.\nAnywayz, Fullmetal Alchemist is, in a way, unique. It is very much a mainstream series, with the appeal of a huge cast of unique characters, action that commonly involves special powers, a fairly\n          \n        straight forward story with some mostly obvious symbolism, and a mix of comedy, action, drama, and even some romance.

It had a fantastic story, and amazing characters, but unfortunately, the pacing was slow, and the ending was somewhat bittersweet. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, it's remake, on the other hand manages to fix just about every problem the original had, and even manages to improve all the good points from the original.\nThe story of the Fullmetal is one not to forget. The story revolves Edward Elric, and his brother, Alphonse Elric, who are searching for a way to return back to their original lives after committing a dangerous taboo, human transmutation. The story revolves around\n          \n        the idea that in order to receive something, you must sacrifice something of equal value. The brothers live in a fantasy-like militaristic nation that has a great focus on the use of alchemy called Amestris. This is an incredible story that uses it's time wisely, with just about every moment having a importance in the grander scheme of things. Not everything is as it seems, as they are some really clever plot twist you won’t forget. Despite the fact the the story is massive, it never seems to complicated. It explains everything in a way that it doesn't talk down to you, but you never feel like you've been given to much info to keep track of either.\nThe best part of the anime by far, are the characters. The show has a huge cast of likable characters, each with own interesting personalities. None of the characters feel like stereotypes, and they are all given enough depth to make them feel alive. There’s the main dou, Edward and Alphonse Elric, two brothers who are searching for a way to get their original bodies back, and their childhood friend, Winry, who is always making sure the two brothers are safe. There’s also the members of the military, Roy Mustang, a man who wishes to become the fuhrer of Amestris, with his devoted team, and a loving father and husband, Hughes. And, of course, the antagonists of the show, the mysterious homunculi whose motives see, unclear at first, and a man looking for revenge, Scar. I haven’t even mentioned the side characters. Ninjas, Alchemy teachers, engineers, and a runaway father. Hell, I don’t even know if I can call these side characters. They're all so important, with their own different goals and character development, they could be considered all to be part of the main cast. They are all so varied, you’re bound to have your own favorites.\nThe animation for the show is great too, although some might prefer the originals art style over this one. It looks a bit more simpler compared to the originals, but that’s mainly because the original had some fantastic artwork. I will say this, though. The animation is great and has some incredible action scenes, and nice facial expressions. The art style is beautiful as well, creating fantastic environments, with a great use of distinct colors. The animation does fall once in a while, but it’s so rare, you’ll hardly notice it.\nAnd finally, the sound. This show has a fantastic orchestrated soundtrack, with solid voice acting. The anime has five opening and ending songs, and they’re all a joy to listen to. The music complements the show greatly. Every scene is backed up by a great track, giving them all it’s intended atmosphere. It can make scenes intense or relaxing, exiting or melancholic, and most importantly, meaningful. The only complaint I would have is that some of these tracks are played too often, but it never really bothered me. The voice actors for this show are great as well. There’s not really a weak voice actor in the bunch, and some of them really do help push the characters to seem more believable. You can’t go wrong with either subbed or dubbed.\nI can’t stop praising this show enough. The show is incredible, with practically no flaws(I tried my best to even find the few nitpicks that I did find). You’ll end up finding these episodes passing by too fast, with these 64 episodes will all hold something memorable. This is not a show you want to miss.\n        "},

It is a good anime, and definitely a must watch. That said, there are just a few things about it that just rub me the wrong way.\n   First of all, the story. It starts out dark, atmospheric, and complicated, just like the first anime, but unfortunately the story loses most of that atmosphere about a quarter of its way into the story, where as FMA was able to maintain that feeling of brooding tension from beginning to end. The pacing is terrible as well,\n          \n        and the reason of this is also the main reason as to why the story loses its feel: the first act.  Arkawa wrote the manga in a fairly clean three part story;\n-the first act (which concludes with Greed's spoiler)\n-the second act (Briggs)\n-the third act (Promise Day)\nThe problem with the first act isn't in its composition, indeed, in terms of composition I'd say that that the first act is the best of the three. Its all in the manner in which the story is told. The entire first act is blasted through in about 15 episodes, followed by a choppy, confusing transition into the second part. The rest of the story suffers as a result, as the second act is entirely plot driven with little space for development with the main characters, which in turn leads to the feeling that you're not actually watching a story as much as you are just watching people you don't care about do things for hours on end. The third act is admittedly outstanding, but there is still a slight feeling of indifference radiated by several characters and certain events take an absurd amount of time to come to pass. There is a reason for this pacing problem, that problem being that the show seemingly expects people to have watched the first series and tries not to bore them with the first act. Which is completely and utterly idiotic given the unbreakable golden rule of adaptations: never assume that the audience has seen the original or read the book. The ending is a mixed bag as well. Its undeniably satisfying, but it is also far too simple and happy for such a complex series.\n   The cast of Brotherhood is a mixed bag, some characters (Ed, Alphonse, Scar, Izumi, Major Armstrong) are solid, but not as good they were in the original. Others (pretty much just Mustang and Winry) are better than they were in the original due to a higher level of focus and more interesting subplots. A few characters, unfortunately, are either boring archetypes or just plain useless. May Chang and Yoki have practically no purpose in the story other than to be love interests or comedy relief. There is no depth to their characters and no real purpose (May Chang does introduce a new kind of Alchemy to the main characters, but that could have also been done just as easily by Ling giving Ed a book or something), so when they get in danger or die, the audience has no reason to give a damn other than \"Well, I thought she was kind of cute.\".  The worst character, however, is easily Olivier Mira Armstrong, and believe me (or hate me, which is probable) when I say that this character is the literal epitome of almost everything wrong with modern media. So many people these days fall in love with characters just because they subvert gender/racial stereotypes, which isn't even remotely close to being a reason to like a character (unless if you in turn are racist or sexist). Olivier Mira Armstrong isn't well rounded, has no character development other than a cliche growing of fondness towards her \"weak\" brother, and does absolutely nothing other than order others around and act like a badass (and by badass I mean backstabbing old guys and getting her ass handed to her by the dumbest character in the series). We never see Olivier laugh, cry, get scared, or do anything other. Good character my ass. As for the villains, there is some good and some bad. Pride and Kimblee are awesome, though I still prefer the orginal Kimblee. Envy is a decent one as far as generic psychopaths are concerned, and the Azula moment that he pulls against Mustang towards the end is spectacularly handled. Wrath on the other hand is a badass but forgettable, and his moment of goodness in the end felt horribly contrived. The big bad lead villain works, but is basically a less subtle Voldemort with a vendetta against God. Once again, badass, but forgettable.\n  As far as art goes, FMAB is okay. Some things look a bit too round (Mustang literally looks like a five year old) and Edward's hair takes even longer to get used to. The action, animation, soundtrack, and voice acting are all brilliant and help ease you through the story where the pacing and the tension fails.\n  Overall, Brotherhood is a pretty good series, as long as you don't think too much about the ending or tha pacing or the characters. Just enjoy the ride and don't expect the masterpiece that the MAL community might pressure you into believing it is.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=46,   ["text"]="                          \n    Full metal alchemist brotherhood the anime that has been called a masterpiece for so many years well to day I'm here to tell you my thoughts on that.Many people feel this way because it strictly follows the manga but just because an anime follows the manga doesn't necessarily mean its good.\nFull metal alchemist brotherhood is about 2 brothers Edward and alphanse Eric. After attempting to bring their mother back from the dead using  human transmutation Edward lost his arm and leg while al lost his entire body and had his soul sealed inside a suit of armor the two brothers set out to find\n          \n        the philosopher stone hoping to get their bodies back to normal.\nStory- Now I will spoil some of the story in this review. FMAB started off pretty good then I realized a lot of stuff was not being explained the pacing was getting more and more shitty. Now many people say FMAB has a amazing story and its a masterpiece well It might've started off like that but it slowly evolved into a save the world from the big bad villain with a god complex kind of story. Now some parts in the story were very suspenseful and had my full attention. Then some parts of the story were really boring and I found myself zoning out continuously. The story had some really grasping scenes like when Hughes was murdered and when the guy with the blonde hair who loves to smoke(forgot his name lol) was stabbed in the back and was paralyzed for the waist down for the rest of his life and when Roy mustang flipped his shit and roasted Envy alive, those scenes were timed really well and caught me off guard. One thing FMAB did was focus on the drama to much which resulted in a shit ton of over dramatic scenes. Some of the dialogue was cliche and I couldn't stop fucking laughing because they were trying to be serious but I just couldn't take it serious, and I even started predicting some of the events in the story would happen. Anyway the story starts to go down hill and now the elric brothers new objective is to stop the bad guy who wants to obtain the power of god with them finding their bodies being their side quest. Then they have this cliche shounen ending where a seventeen year old kid beats the shit out of god. I mean this is just beyond cliche, the fight was good but i wasn't suprised because in the end i knew he would win. And the fairy tale happily ever after ending was disappointing to.   They never explained the origins of alchemy clearly nor do they explain anything else clearly so I was left with a shit ton of questions but no fucking answers. The story just didn't pull me in and It felt like I was just watching your typical action anime the story wasn't shit it just wasn't a masterpiece like everyone said it was.\nAnimation / Sound : The Animation was pretty good the character models and the back grounds were well done and so was the animation and art for the alchemy. The fight scenes where pretty neat but nothing too flashy. The voice acting was A1 I thought the sound effects for the fights and explosions were done well to. The intros and ending were just mind blowing sometimes I would just go on YouTube and just watch and listen to the intros. \nCharacters: This is the weakest part of the anime.\nOur 2 MCs Edward and Al do not change through out the whole series they remain the same naive little boys they were at the beginning hell the only thing that changed about Edward was his height he became taller as the series continued. Most the characters in FMAB get no development at all and some are just useless as fuck cough...cough... winry, now I don't dislike winry but sometimes she just annoyed the hell out of me and got in the way. The only characters in this show who got good development was Roy Mustang, Envy, crippled cigarette guy(forgot his name), hoenhime (I think I spelled it wrong), and Ling/Greed. Half of the villains on here are evil just for the hell of it and oh yeah the main villain with the god complex is called father he basically created the rest of the villains. Each of them are named after the 7 deadly sins and called homunculus. Apparently each villain represents a fragment of his soul you have\nThe homonculus were extremely shallow and were evil to be evil. I mean out of all seven only three shine and those three are Wrath, Greed, Envy. The rest are extremely uninteresting including father. If i had to compare him to a villain it would be Aizen from bleach. \nNow out of all of these villains the most memorable was Envy because of his hatred of humans and his twisted personality he was very exciting to watch and his death was put together really well. Now back to the other characters  Scar was very interesting at first but as the series continued he started to bore the hell out of me until I finally wasn't interested in him any more. Like I said before Roy Mustang got a lot of development he went from the cool and calm guy we know and love to a bloodthirsty animal obsessed over finding out who killed Hughes. Now full metal alchemist brotherhood has some interesting characters but failed to give them any development to the point where I didn't give a fuck if they died.\nIn the end by no means was FMAB a bad show no it was a good show that had a lot of potential but it failed to amaze me the unique story was ruined after a couple of episodes. I personally think this anime is overrated as fuck it wasn't bad its just overrated and it just didn't prove to be a masterpiece like everyone claimed it was  , but in the end this is just my opinion . The funny thing is I watched this before  the FMA 2003 version because everyone kept telling FMA 2003 was trash and the funny thing is I ended up liking 2003 more.   Do i recommend this show yes you might find your experience different than mine after all we are two completely different people. Well I'm done i hoped you enjoyed this review Peace!!!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=75,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Before watching Brotherhood, I've watched the original series few years back. FMA 1 was good and awesome too, but the thing I hated about it is that the ending is not tragic and is not satisfying. So, knowing that there was an another adaptation of the series made me all curious about it.\nSince I enjoyed watching Brotherhood, I never realized I finised watching the whole thing in just one week.\n\"Why?\", you may ask? Well, at the first few episodes, the pacing of the plot was pretty fast, for someone who have watched the original FMA before. But, if you were not aware of the original\n          \n        series, maybe the pacing would be okay for you. It was not as detailed as the first series, but since there are new additions to the plot, new friends and enemies, and fuller character development, especially with Winry [who was just a minor supporting character in the original series] and of course, with the Elric Brothers, you won't bother about the pacing and embrace these awesome changes instead.\nThe story plot was different from the original FMA; the first 6 episodes were adapted from FMA1, and the next episodes were all different. Since this plot was faithful to the manga, you'll be surprised... and happy, that there are new things to discover in Brotherhood, as I've mentioned above. The addition of the east country of Xing and the northern Briggs, and their corresponding characters, was like a breath of fresh air to the series, as we can see and expect more stories and more types of alchemy and auto-mail. Also, the origins, forms, and the battles against the homunculi were totally different too. The fight scenes were all amazing. Yes, there are bloodbaths here and there, but that's the part I love the most while watching them fight, whether by weapons, alchemy, or simply a fist-to-fist battle.\nMaybe the part I love the most in watching FMA is on the last few episodes. The ending was simply touching, since  Edward still sacrificed something for his younger brother, but in Brotherhood, he sacrificed something different... and less tragic. I also loved the part where Ed, Al, and Hohenheim worked together when they fought with Father, and I simply cried when Hohenheim said to Trisha's grave that he's happy that at last, Edward called him \"Dad\". The ending of FMA 1 was disturbing and not really satisfying, whereas in the ending of Brotherhood, you will love it so much you will wish for a sequel... or an afterstory perhaps.\nThe art and animation in Brotherhood was clearer, more crisp, and lot more contemporary than the original, as expected from a recently-produced series. I'm not really that particular about how the anime was drawn or animated, but Brotherhood was one of the exemptions to it. The battles were not crappy, and I really got creeped out when the \"immortal army\" was released [the white doll-like humans] from the Central underground.\nThe seiyuus have done a good job in portraying their roles in Brotherhood, especially Ed and Al's. I also love the OPs and EDs used in Brotherhood, especially \"Hologram\", which was the second OP and surprisingly the last ED of the series. The background music used were perfectly synched with the scenes in a particular episode. After watching the series, you will definitely want to listen to the whole OST.\nAll of the kinds of characters in Brotherhood-- from the heroes, supporting characters, new characters, and to the villains-- it wasn't possible NOT to love at least one of these kinds. I even loved the character of Greed, who was a bad-turned-good character, and in the end, found satisfaction from his comrades. Also, the guys from Xing were also amazing, especially May, which inspired Al to study eastern alchemy in the latter parts of the story. Also, the addition of Alex Armstrong's older sister was also awesome, and also one of my favorite new characters.\nAnd most especially, I love how Winry was turned into a REALLY important character in the series, and how Ed masked his OBVIOUS liking to her.\nI loved the series. I laughed with it. I cried like a baby, especially whenever Ed shows his selfless nii-san love for Al. I was intrigued with every ending of the episode, which was one of the reasons I finished the whole thing in a week. The series was not a disappointment in my part, and it made me wish that all of the other remakes would be AS GOOD as this. This is a quick recommend to my friends who love to watch shounen and for those who were familiar with the original FMA, because Brotherhood was told in the manga's point of view, and the story came in full circle in the end.\nRight now, I am suffering from a post-anime series depression, which I think will last a few weeks or more. It's not because the series was bad, rather, Brotherhood was too good for me to finish quickly. All my friends who've watched Brotherhood had the same feeling: the feeling of not watching any anime series for a few weeks before moving on, since when you finished watching Brotherhood, it would feel that a part of you ended with it. After watching the series, I was stunned for a few minutes, and told myself \"This is it; I finished FMA Brotherhood. What will happen next?\"\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a good addition to the anime series you should watch before you die [LOL, but seriously]. If you like more action, NO filler episodes, and a satisfying ending, this one's for you.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=74,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Full Metal Alchemist is the work of mangaka Arakawa Hiromu, and is undoubtedly her most famous work. While an anime series under the name of Full Metal Alchemist did air in 2003-2004, the actual manga itself had not finished at that point and, as a result, the ending differs significantly from the actual manga’s ending. Airing in 2009-2010, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood (henceforth referred to just as FMA) rectified this. Finally viewers were able to experience the joy of the entire Full Metal Alchemist story adapted to anime format – and what a joy it is.\nFMA is very quick in establishing an action-packed storyline, soon\n          \n        evolving from the small-scale tale of two boys trying to find a way to recover their bodies into an epic quest to save the people of the nation of Amestris from being literally devoured, as a family of homunculi seek to gain the power of God (perhaps the Japanese ‘Kami’ is more appropriate here, as this God is more of a divine lifeforce than a fully-fledged supreme being). One of the coolest parts about FMA’s storyline, and this came as quite a surprise to me, was how dramatically the pacing slows down in the last quarter. These last 16 episodes represent only about 2 days’ worth of the story, and from this point on everything really is switched up to 11. The action definitely is amped up from this point on, but so too are the personal stories of our characters. It’s hugely rewarding to follow all the mini-storylines as they comes together for the story’s suitably epic conclusion. Without going into any spoilers, the ending to FMA was as close to perfection as I think anime will ever get.\nFMA succeeds on multiple levels, being an accomplished mixture of the more enjoyable and light-hearted fights and comedy that a good shounen needs, with a very mature and intelligent approach to the personalities of the characters. It straddles the line between a more adult philosophical anime and a shounen anime placing action first and foremost, dedicating equal time to both these approaches. This is possible largely thanks to the concept of alchemy – the superhuman powers alchemy grants its user is almost absolute. The theme of humans playing god is heavily prevalent in the show, as is the concept of religion in general (Never is the maxim ‘advanced science is indistinguishable from miracles’ more applicable than in the case of alchemy in FMA). It’s a very compelling topic of discussion, and one happily that FMA doesn’t fail to address. The first mini-story of the show, set in the religious town of Leto, is designed to introduce you to our main characters, is focused exactly on this idea, with a healthy dose of action and drama for good measure.\nWithout further ado though, let’s look at the characters of FMA and why it is this aspect of FMA that is truly what sets the show apart. These characters are what drive the show’s considerable runtime to be a constantly entertaining and, thankfully, filler free experience. I counted about 30 characters who received decent development in the story, an astonishing figure when you consider that’s a character being fully developed every 2 episodes!\nIt probably won’t come as a shock to you, but it soon becomes apparent when watching FMA that the characters were its biggest strength. This is not only due to the fact that none of them stick to the archetypes loved by many (myself included), but because of how many of the leading characters are both physically and emotionally scarred. Our main characters, Edward and Alphonse, strive to save the world, but not because it is a simple driving principle that they live by, but because they need a solution to atone for their sins. This is not an uncommon driving force in FMA: the Ishbalan war soldiers, Lieutenant Hawkeye, Major Armstrong and Colonel Mustang, are also examples of characters living with regret, as is Scar, an Ishabalan hunted by the country and determined to exact revenge on the soliders of Amestris for killing his entire race! These characters are spending the bulk of their lives having to deal with the consequences for their actions. \nThis is why the primary villains of the series, the homunculi, are so much more important than just punching bags. Each homunculus is named after one of the seven deadly sins, and overcoming and defeating the sins that our cast bears is brilliantly exemplified by the action-packed battles with the antagonists. These details add fantastic depth to what could easily have been a very plain ‘stopping bad-guys trying to take over the world’ situation. In a normal shounen anime, I would normally say overcoming enemy after enemy is not the same as character development, but in the case of FMA, it very much is. \nFullmetal Alchemist makes full (hehe) use of the wonderful opportunities the writer has set up to allow the characters to flourish as humans, not just ideals with bodies or walking plot devices. As a result, the tragedies that befall these characters are not only obstacles for them to overcome. No, they are genuine disasters that scar these characters in longer-lasting and character defining ways. It is the way that the characters are shaped by the actions that surround them that gives them such relatable and loveable traits. \nI won’t spend too long on the animation and music section of FMA, because this review is getting long enough as it is! The sound and music of FMA is something I regularly look back on fondly, because there’s not a moment where it slips up. Voice acting is perfectly cast, and Edward’s squeal when someone calls him short never gets old. The theme songs for FMA are also consistently on point, starting strong with Yui’s fantastic ‘Again’ and never looking back, especially impressive due to the fact that FMA switches up its OP and ED a total of 5 times in its 65 episode running time. \nBy contrast, if there’s one thing that Full Metal Alchemist doesn’t excel in, it’s the animation. It does the job and is pleasing to look at, but isn’t anything that you would write home about: character movements are smooth and some of the alchemical constructions are pretty impressive, but that’s pretty much that. \nTo wrap-up, FMA is that rare breed of shounen anime where the difficulties the characters face are solved by brains sometimes just as much as they are by brawn, but FMA doesn’t stop there. The characters are all likeable, well-rounded and intensely well-written people. Such is the complete quality of Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood that, over the course of writing this review, my analysis of the characters and their situations has led me to respect them even more than I did having just finished the series for a second time.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=72,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    So in honor of FMA Day 2014 (I know I'm a bit late), I've decided to write a review for my #1 all-time favorite anime (and manga), Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\nHonestly, I don't know what I could say about this show that hasn't already been said, but I'll give it a shot anyway.\nI'm not going to do what I typically do for a review which is listing the categories and what score I gave them; just know that everything is 10/10. \nI'm also going to address some critique that I've seen of the show and why I agree/disagree with it.\nAlso I'm avoiding talking about the 03\n          \n        anime because as far as I'm concerned it doesn't exist.\nI apologize in advance for this wall of text.\nThe story of this show is absolutely phenomenal. Not only does it manage to tell the story of the main two characters, Ed and Al, it also gives ample time to all the other characters to show where they come from and how they think. And the show does this all without losing steam or taking long breaks from the action, and also without having characters monologuing in the middle of fights. There's also plenty of comedy, but it never once ruins the mood of the show (cough cough Pandora Hearts).\nPeople like to bash on the rushed beginning of the show, but the reason for the rushed beginning is called Fullmetal Alchemist 2003. Brotherhood quickly sped through the episodes that the 2003 anime had already covered because the good stuff was yet to come. If the pacing at the beginning isn't appealing to you, I'd suggest also watching the corresponding episodes of the original anime. That pacing is more true to the manga's. Plus, after the first 13 or so episodes of Brotherhood, the pacing slows down but, once again, without losing steam. Once the show hits episode 15, new characters that weren't in the 2003 adaptation appear and immediately take part in the story. But the new characters don't stop there. They keep appearing for a long while after that.\nEverything in the story is so flawlessly executed that even this type of anime isn't your thing, you can't help but admire how perfectly everything fits together and how many pains the author took in planning every step of the story. Then when you go back and watch the show again, you realize all the subtle foreshadowing that was carefully placed and not obvious enough that you pick up on it before it happens.\nThis show is technically classified as a shounen anime, though I tend to cringe at that because FMAB isn't really a shounen. If you compare it to a more typical shounen such as Soul Eater, you begin to realize just how different it is. In Brotherhood, there's no yelling out the names of attacks, no long breaks in fights to monologue about plans, and the alchemy used isn't seen as an unquestionable staple of the world. Alchemy itself constantly called into question and many times the characters are forced to ask themselves if it's morally right to use alchemy to change the course of the world (whereas in Soul Eater they don't really debate the morality of the souls they collect). \nOverall, even people that don't like anime like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I've gotten several of my friends (as well as my dad) into anime using this show as a beginning step. If you watch the dub and ignore the obvious fact that it's animated, it doesn't seem like what people typically perceive as an anime at all. It's on a whole other level from everything else I've seen.\nIn addition, Brotherhood sticks to the manga nearly perfectly (the only things cut out were some minor character development and comedy scenes). Considering Studio Bones has a tendency to deviate from the source material (see: Ouran, Soul Eater, Noragami, FMA 03, etc.), with this show they did an admirable job with delivering an adaptation so accurate that you can read/watch one and not have to watch/read the other, even though I'd recommend doing both because of the anime's gorgeous art and music and the manga's few forgotten moments and the slightly different chapter divides.\nBecause Brotherhood was put into production when the manga was wrapping up, the show avoids filler episodes (possible exceptions include episodes 1 and 27, in which 1 simply introduces the characters and some foreshadowing and 27 is basically a recap episode that also provides some hints at foreshadowing). If you miss an episode of the show, chances are you'll be very confused as to what is happening. Each episode smoothly leads into the next and they're pretty much unskippable. If it's your first or even second time watching the show, I wouldn't recommend skipping even the fillers because of the foreshadowing they provide. I've seen firsthand how confused the \"fillers\" can make people while I laugh and say that it'll be explained later. And it will. Everything gets explained so clearly, yet all the subtle ways in which the plot points connect amazes me every time I watch the show.\nAs far as worldbuilding, I give triple thumbs-up to Hiromu Arakawa. She created multiple countries and while we don't get to see too much of life back home (I still want a Xing spinoff), the ideology of the foreigners and how it conflicts with the Amestrian characters' clearly shows. On top of that, Arakawa designed a government system which plays a crucial role in the story (then again, everything plays a crucial role in the story), as well as all of the laws and finer points of how the country is run. I've seen several other animes in which the government is used a plot point, but none of them use government quite as effectively as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood does. So many side stories and spinoffs could potentially grow out of the complex world Arakawa created.\nSorry for writing so much about the story, but there's a lot to write about.\nThe art and animation are amazing. Not as sharp as Attack on Titan, maybe, but it definitely fulfills all expectations. The battle animation is fluid and well executed, there's subtle use of CGI at certain points, the alchemy lightning is pleasing to watch, and the backgrounds are nicely detailed and do well to set the mood. Some people have said that it's simpler than the 03 anime's style, but I honestly can't see it. If anything, I find it more detailed. There's a few moments in which the same shot is used for more than a few seconds, as well as moments where the characters don't move around very much, but this is a minor detail and excusable considering the top-notch fight animation. There are no dips in quality throughout the show, and everything is handled as one would expect a high-budget anime to be handled.\nOne of the things I especially love about the art in FMAB is the subtle aging of the characters. They age gradually, like real people, and you don't even notice the process happening until you look back on their appearances at the beginning and realize how much they've changed.\nIn addition, the women of FMAB are completely unsexualized as well as totally kickass. After watching other animes with copious amounts of fanservice, only now can I appreciate this anomaly and not take it for granted\nI really loved the music in this show. While I felt that some tracks were overplayed in the beginning, this becomes less of a problem toward the end of the show because tunes you haven't heard before are suddenly revealed. The opening and ending songs are also very pretty and catchy (though I'm not too big a fan of the third ED), with my personal favorite opening being the last one. However, the first and fourth openings are awesome as well, and I think the first one in particular captures the mood of the show. I also loved the synchronization of some of the sequences to the songs, which I think is a very nice touch.\nAs far as voice acting, I've seen this anime both dubbed and subbed, and while I like the dub more, both versions are really good. The actors are spot-on as their characters, and I love how they managed to get most of the voice actors from the 2003 anime back for Brotherhood. Even Alphonse's '03 dub actor, Aaron Dismuke, came back, though not as Al because he was too old at that point; instead he voices a minor but important character. Overall, the voice acting in both English and Japanese was really good, and it's safe to go with whichever one you're more comfortable with (though personally I'd say go with the dub because that way you can concentrate on the pretty art and animation).\nThe characters are simply outstanding. Not only do they all get their backstories thoroughly explored, they all develop and change throughout the show. I've seen a lot of people griping about the fact that the show pretty much completely changes themes from the beginning, but the theme change is BECAUSE the characters changed. Wow, characters can change? Like real people?! I had no idea!\nWhenever I'm getting people into this show, I tell them, \"If you see a character that you kind of like, don't worry, because their backstory will be explained.\" And they always seem kind of doubtful, but in the end they realize that it's true.\nAnother reason why I hold this show in the highest regards is that there are many different races, cultures, and religions being portrayed; and while some characters make racist comments, the cultures themselves are treated with the highest respect. The episode detailing the events in Ishval is one of the most grim of the show; the Ishvalans being handled by the story as carefully as if they were a real race.\nThe romance in this show develops subtly and beautifully and never once hijacks the plot. In addition, while it's amusing to watch Ed and Winry struggling with their feelings for each other, Ed does something pretty atypical for a protagonist: He blames himself for making Winry upset, and not because she got mad at him, but because he knows he should have been there for her. It's not all that often you see the male protagonist apologizing for causing the female protagonist grief.\nOn top of how well-rounded and three-dimensional all of the characters are, they're all very well designed. Each one of them looks and moves differently according to their personality, and a lot of the characters change outfits regularly (which doesn't seem like much, but it's the little things that count, especially considering most animes don't do this and a lot of them have some kind of uniform, school or otherwise, to avoid having to have the characters changing outfits).\nAll in all, every one of the characters in FMAB leave a lasting impression on the viewer, whether they were in the show for one episode or all of them. It's so hard to pick a favorite.\nEven though this show, at 64 episodes, is the longest anime I've seen yet, it's such a fast watch that it honestly doesn't feel like it. While I personally haven't set any records with the speed of my watching, friends of mine have finished the show in time periods from 2-4 days, because of the sheer addictiveness of it. And the show IS addictive. Every few months I get a strong urge to rewatch it and cry all over again. And while I'll never completely forget every detail, every time I rewatch it I'm still blown away. \nThis show draws you in with the seriousness of the story, the depth of the characters, the gorgeous art and sound, and pretty much every other detail you can think of. To sum it up, if you want a viewing experience on a whole other level from anything you've seen, if you want an ending that will make you break down and rethink your life, if you've seen the original FMA and enjoyed it, watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. It's not the #1 rated anime on MAL by accident, and it'll definitely always be my #1.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=72,   ["text"]="                          \n    I was dreading having to make my way through Brotherhood at some point considering my high regard for the first series and not really liking the manga adaptation's more conventional plot developments. But considering enough people were praising the daylights out of Brotherhood and some even boasting that the first series was no longer relevant, I decided to check things out for myself and see what got people giddy over this adaptation of the series. And after venturing my way through Brotherhood, I would have to say that those calling the first series irrelevant are ridiculous considering both titles have completely different takes on their\n          \n        source material and the handling of them that whichever series you prefer would depend on what you are looking for in an anime.\nIn Brotherhood's case, it takes the Fullmetal Alchemist manga and makes a more closer adaptation of the source material which is quite focused on world building and creating a grand scale plot coming out of the Elrics finding out details about the Philosopher's Stone and eventually finding out about a national conspiracy and heinous plot connected to the Homunculus and powerful figures in the Amestris military. This take on FMA does follow a more conventional plot than the first TV series as much of the complex characterization found with prominent characters in the original series is greatly toned down with Brotherhood creating a more plot-focused series and morality with many characters being more black and white as the series has more purely \"good\" and \"bad\" characters with the former being always right in their convictions within the series and the latter having no redeemable traits and being wrong in their actions. With me believing that good characters in an anime should be morally grey with flawed heroes and villains with redeemable traits, I wasn't digging Brotherhood's conventional take on characters.\nBrotherhood did have some elements that I did get some enjoyment out of. With Brotherhood being more focused on world building and plot advancement, the series expands more on the world of the series than what the first series did by introducing more branches of the military and some other countries neighboring Amestris, particularly Xerxes and Xing. This also allows the introduction of some new characters in the series with several characters from Xing and within the military that Ed and Al befriend and ally with when dealing with the Homunculus and the conspiracy they uncover. In addition, some characters from the original series who were underdeveloped and not having much screen time (Hohenheim, Alex Armstrong and Roy Mustang's men being prominent examples) are given more focus in this series, get some moments of fleshing out and are given bigger roles to play.\nStill though, there are enough issues I have with Brotherhood that outweigh the praises I give it above. The show's first 12-13 episodes run at a fast pace providing little time to connect with characters introduced and with the events of those episodes having been portrayed in the first series, Bones appeared to have intentionally sped through the events to get going with what wasn't covered by the first series. With Bones more closely following the manga's storyline for Brotherhood, these earlier episodes had featured a major flaw to FMA manga-ka Hiromu Arakawa's earlier chapters in that her fast advancement of events gave little time for emotional investment from readers in regards to how characters reacted to major events that shook their resolves as the lack of time and depth on plotting in earlier chapters did kill their quality to a great extent. With the slower pacing and greater character focus found in FMA's first series, Arakawa had adopted these elements to a degree with her storytelling in later chapters which helped improve the quality of her writing.\nI also found myself getting quite irritated with the show's comedy getting in the way of more serious moments. This was quite prominent in Brotherhood's earlier episodes where moments of slapstick and characters going super-deformed killed the suspense of serious moments. While the series does tone down on these moments in later episodes as the plot gets darker and more serious, they still pop up on occasion and when they do, I still found them to be a mood killer during most scenes.\nDespite the praises I gave for new characters and expanded depth on underdeveloped characters who appeared in the original series, I couldn't give the same thing for a majority of other characters who appeared in the first series. Brotherhood's portrayal of these characters are more conventional and less complex as heroic characters aren't confronted with any possible flaws to their actions and personal beliefs; as well as all the villains being so shallowly evil that they're laughable and I could care less if they get beaten up and killed off.\nThe final episodes to a good extent also felt quite contrived with how things progress just to allow all the surviving characters to have a good ending. A number of moments were deus ex machina thrown in for villains to be defeated through means which the series never explored and they kind of cheapen how I felt about the hardships faced by the Elrics and other prominent characters to get what they desire.\nIn terms of presentation, visual details with Brotherhood are a bit simpler than the first series with color tones being more subdued. This is especially prominent with background designs in many shots as their quality looks quite washed out compared to scenery found in the foreground. Still, character designs of those from the original series still look the same as they were from over five years ago. While animation shortcuts are apparent in a good number of shots in Brotherhood, the series does have its animation highlights with the occasional fluid fight sequence and some good fight scenes involving Envy's true form.\nFor music, much of Brotherhood's insert music consists of stringed and piano pieces that do well at complementing the peaceful and intense moments seen throughout the series. On the other hand, many of the OP and ED musical choices chosen for the series consisted of some generic J-Pop and J-Rock that hardly grabbed my interest, though the first OP, Yui's again, did well at fitting with Brotherhood's mood.\nOverall, I found my perceptions of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood to be no different from when I read the manga. It goes for a more conventional style of storytelling compared to the first FMA series and while it does have its moments of good quality involving character focus and world building, its more plot heavy and conventional focus drives it to lose much of the complexity given to prominent characters of the first series and the poor quality to its plotting in its beginning and ending episodes does kill quite a bit of the plot buildup that I would be expected to care about. While a worthwhile watch to those craving an epic-style action-adventure series or wanting a more faithful adaptation of the FMA manga, those wanting better characterization and solid drama with the series (in my case) would be better off seeing the 2003 anime adaptation of FMA. \n        "},

At first I was a real anime hater, and didn't want anything to do with it. I thought it was messed up (one example would be lots of fan service with stupid things like --> ecchi, harem, or incest). Although there are lots of retarded shows that incorporate the said stuff and more, I realized not all shows were like that. \nThis show managed to drag me into the anime world and it has done it with the masterful storytelling, as it managed to weave things from different parts of the show into\n          \n        one thing at the end. The characters were wonderful, and none of them felt like they were useless to the story or show, which made me sad whenever a side character dies. The opening on their own where phenomenal, but what makes them even more amazing was the fact that thy always managed to fit exactly what was happening in the anime at the time. The soundtrack was also really good.\nThis show is deserving of the number one spot in anyone's list, and if you dint watch it yet you should.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=67,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    When the original Fullmetal Alchemist came out in 2003, it was apparent that it followed the manga at first, but them went on it's path. Which didn't make it bad, but it annoyed many people, including me (Even though I didn't watch it until about 9 or 10 years after it came out.) \nBut! Our fandom had been blessed with a brand new (I'm speaking pass tense) series, that follows the manga, and is pretty damn good. I have been intimidated to write about this series because well, it's too awesome to tackle with reviews. \nBut here we go! \nStory 9/10 \nThis story is unique!\n          \n        I've never seen, or read, a story such as this one. What I think I liked most about it, was the fact that it HAD so many episodes. A story like this one can't be just put out there and finish up in 26 episodes or less. They did an amazing job wrapping everything up at the end of 64 episodes. \nWhat especially loved was the fact that the story flowed so nicely, even though when I first watched it I was confused during the first 13 episodes because I had watched FMA '03 before hand. You should probably wait a little bit before diving into this series after finished the original. It may seem the same, but it's a whole different ball park. However, no questions are left unanswered, and there are a lot of feels involved. \nArt: 9/10 \nI am personally a fan of BONES, they do great animation work with a unique style of their own. It works nicely for this show, it has it's dark moments and the animation fits with that. \nThere's also the standard; 'Anime serious face' and the 'anime goofing off face'. EX: Ouran High school host club. I think BONES did really well, with character detail. But not so much with background animation, things seemed a bit off there. You'll see what I mean if you watch it. \nSound 10/10 \nExpect 10s from here on out, and I don't usually hand out 10s. \nAhhhhh this series has the most beautiful sound track, each scene that has music accompaniment has a set of emotion. The sound track can make you laugh and cry, there even have been some scenes really helped with anger or hatred towards a character. \nThey re-use songs a lot, but still have a large amount of songs. My favorite is 'Brothers'. You will hear that a few times, it's a sound track that I could listen to all the time if I could. \nCharacter 10/10 \nThe story of this series effects the characters in a certain way (I can't say too much on that with out giving spoilers).  And what I really, really, love about these characters is that they react REALISTICALLY. I /adore/ characters who have negative backgrounds and react according to them. \nEven Maes Hughes who acts as a comic relief, is serious when he needs to be. There aren't any annoying characters, and there are a crap ton of strong female characters.  \nYou will grow to love all these characters, and feel for them! \nEnjoyment 10/10 \nThis anime, is hilarious, then sad, then action packed. I loved it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. \nOver all: 10/10\nThis is an anime that will live in my heart for years. I've re-watched it 5 times, and never get tired of it. I HIGHLY recommend you watch this series, you will not regret it. \nNow, about the dub. I'm a person who prefers dub over subbed. But I can watch subbed and I know when I hear a bad dub. This is NOT a bad dub. In fact, it's the best I've seen in all the anime I have seen. I also highly recommend watching this anime dubbed if you like it that way. You will not be disappointed. Vic Mignogna plays the main character Edward Elric, and well, it's down right amazing. As well as the rest of the actors. \nThat's all, happy watching ^^ \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=66,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This is one of the greatest anime of all time.  I know that's kind of bold statement to make but in my opinion it is one of the greats and my personal favorite.  The story is great and is paced so well especially in comparison to FMA 03 the original adaption.  This anime's greatest strength is its story and characters because its characters are just that characters not cardboard cutout archetypes.  For example Winry Rockbell starts the show as this stereotypical childhood friend who is always keeping the main heroes in line but while she continues that she expands with a\n          \n        back story and emotion that shows she cares for her friends and the people around her.  The two main protagonist are Edward and Alphonse Elric who are excellently written as the short-tempered leader who just wants to protect who he loves in Edward and Alphonse as such a  softy who just wants do what's right in his quest for his body.  The story as I said before has excellent pacing moving from gripping drama to bits of humor to intense action seemlessly.  I'm not going to say this is perfect because it isn't some of fights lack speed and weight in the animation.  Speaking of which the animation isn't anything to write home about in my opinion keep in mind I watch this in 2014 so for its time its above average.  The sound overall is quite good the theme was carried from FMA which isn't a problem and the openings are much improved with the first standing out.  Overall its at least worth watching to get your own idea of it\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=66,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This show is a shounen anime. Or, at least, it is supposed to be. It is the topped ranked anime on MAL right now for a reason. You come to care for the Elric brothers, the Rockbells, for the whole cast.\nFor a show that ultimately is about the bonds we form here on earth, FMA:B does a phenomenal job of portraying these bonds in a fictional world with exceptional character development all around.\nOne thing is also to be noted. This series never forgets. Never. Ed's inscription holds true, but not just for the 3rd-- those who are lost are never forgotten, not once. This show\n          \n        consistently and and meaningfully calls back to early moments in the show the Elric brothers said they'd never forget, making those moments relevant again as new challenges are faced.\nI think it was about six episodes in that I had to stop my first binge run. It was because I was absolutely horrified and disgusted. Normally shows can't shake me. But some of the themes this touches on feel so real the characters that they affect seem so human that you can't help be mortified at the tragedies, just as elation comes when it is due.\nThat's another big thing. The humor in this show is mild but it balances out the sorrow. It builds the relationships in tandem with the drama to show us something that isn't perfect, but is so clearly superior to Sakura's friendship speeches and although the dialogue at times felt subpar, it never felt completely pointless.\nThe action scenes, too, were rarely drawn out unnecessarily and were all beautifully crafted. I'm crossing my fingers that more shows will get their brotherhood, because although this series is longer than the original it felt more focused, and certainly it ended up feeling more meaningful. I may have given few hours to this show, but I feel equivalent exchange was not at play here because it has given me a lot more than I was expecting.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=64,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Pros: Brilliant plot, excellent opening/endings, perfect flawed characters \nCons: Rushed Beginning, art style is a little cartoon-y \n Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is undoubtedly one of the most popular animes out there, and for a good reason. It follows two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric who attempted to bring their mother back to life with the most forbidden alchemy: Human Transmutation.  Their attempt failed, costing Alphonse his entire body, and Edward his left leg. In a desperate attempt to keep his brother with him, Edward willingly sacrificed his right arm in exchange for Alphonse's soul. Edward bound Al's soul to a suit of armor he\n          \n        found in his basement.\n This plot is perfectly explained in the original anime \"Fullmetal Alchemist\". It's like they created this with the thought that everyone watched the original first. I would highly recommend watching the first one if you want more insight on the transmutation, or reading the manga version. \n I also criticized the art style to be a little cartoony for my taste, but gave it a  8. The style itself is clean and fresh but feels very simplistic. However, overtime when you watch this anime- one of my favorite parts is that the characters do not stay the same age. The characters grow in the story as you watch, and you don't realize it until you see the teenage protagonist actually looks like a young adult in comparison to the 12 year old you once got introduced to. \n The soundtrack is wonderful, it's a great listen. The openings also make the characters grow/change like in the anime. When you see them separately, and look at them side-by-side, you'll see the growth. One of the most uniquest things I have ever seen in an Anime. \n The characters in FMAB, are all lovely. They each have there own story/quest. In the end, you really enjoy watching them grow with the protagonists and see them help Edward and Alphonse reach there goal including there own. \n Overall, this anime is wonderful and heartbreaking, and will make you laugh and cry. Even though this anime has flaws, I gave a 10 because of the wonderful journey it gave me. Its truly a treat.  It's a beautiful story you will honestly never forget. \n        "},

This anime doesn't strechs out to another season and give us a full compelet story in one series. It doesn't matter if you have seen the first installment of the series ( full metal alchemist) because this anime shows all the information to us, viewer, in full complete story. The\n          \n        character in this anime is well blanced.

It's very interesting to follow them and see how they evolve through the serie.\nFor me it's very important that it does not only have strong male characters but also very strong female characters. I personally love animes (and mangas) that have very strong females and that doesn't go for the more typical type of female that we often see in animes and mangas. \nThis anime is truly epic and if you haven't watched it you should seriously reconsider.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=61,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Best show I've ever seen.\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is probably the best series I've ever seen. There are several reasons for this: \n1) The story is truly compelling! It really grows on you, since the viewer wants the Elric brothers to reach their goal of getting their bodies back, because of their hard childhood, where their dad left home and their mother died. You grow a sympathy towards these two boys. The plot is amazing, though I don't want to spoil anything. The idea of Alchemy is great in my opinion. So I'll give the story: 10/10\n2) The art is top notch, the fighting scenes are\n          \n        amazing and the backgrounds are beautiful. The characters are well-made and they actually seem really human, though they are animated. (Wrath's fighting scenes are awesome!) - Art: 9/10 (almost 10/10l)\n3) The sounds in FMA Brotherhood is good, but still the show's weakest aspect. Sometimes the background music doesn't really fit, but it doesn't bring down the show. The opening and closing songs are really good, the second opening is one of my favourite Japanese songs. The genereal sounds and talking are good as well. - Sounds deserve a 9/10 (Close to 8/10, due to the background music being out of place at times). \n4) What really made me love FMA: Brotherhood is the characters in the show. They are truly geniously put together. I am a twin brother myself, so I was really touched by Edward's and Alphonse's brotherhood, since I feel that I would go through the same shit as they do, only to help my brother. \nRoy Mustang is a great character, who has quite some shadows of his yesterdays hanging on his shoulders. He has killed many men during some civil wars, which happened in the country. \nScar is also an important character, who was filled with hatred and seeks revenge on the State Alchemists, who destroyed the Ishbalans, who was Scar's people. \nLouis Armstrong is a fun character, who brings a nice humourous aspect to the show with his Gai Sensei-like emotional and masculine behaviour. \nThere are tons of other great characters, I could go on forever, but these were the highlights to me. \n5) All the reasons mentioned above made me enjoy this show more than I've enjoyed any other show. The plot is amazingly well-written and the characters are really believable and sometimes this show just bring the chills, since you really symphatize with the characters. The ending is just perfect, so I'll give FMA: Brotherhood the biggest 10/10 I've ever given to any show. \n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=60,   ["text"]="                          \n    While FMA brotherhood offers an overall neatly wrapped full experience in anime and is a very easy anime to watch and be entertained by, it seems like many of the series'huge flaws which hurts its overall artistic quality are either being glossed over or are just not being talked about enough. In this review, I'd like to mainly address these issues and hopefully bring forth discussion. Is the anime good? Arguably, yes, it has a lot of great crowd pleasing aspects. Is it perfect and deserving of a 10/10? Sadly, far from it.  If this review sounds in anyway cynical and pessimistic, I apologize,\n          \n        for I only think the pages of praise this anime gets needs to be balanced out with a bit of honest criticism. I also felt that I couldn't give an adequate critique without using points in the plot as examples, so I'm sorry in advance for there are some spoilers included. \nFirstly, I found that brotherhood was ridden with far too many lazy convenient plot devices and shonen cliches for it to be enjoyable. What do I mean by this concretely? (spoilers ahead) If you look at episode 34 isn't it too much of a coincidence that sloth showed up right when the Elric brothers did in the exact same room? Consider the area sloth has to cover and how many times he actually emerges, isn't it too much of a coincidence that he showed up at Briggs right when the brothers was at the basement? Rather than having a story which melds encounters together naturally and smoothly, we get a cheap device made purely to advance the plot on very questionable grounds. There are other examples as well where we can see characters coincidentally being brought together if you watch the anime again. This is a terrible example of bad story writing and plot advancement. \nWhat about shonen cliches? Just count the number of times in a fight where at the last crucial moment another character shows up to hit the enemy/ally to save someone. I realize that's a really badass shonen cliche, and when used sparingly, it can be somewhat epic, but in this one, it felt too tired and predictable.\nThe anime is also just far too naive and the actions and consequences of its characters are far too oversimplified. Brotherhood's predecessor might have its weaknesses, but it shines in it's realistic gritty overtones, and character growth in the Elrics as they journey through a bittersweet coming of age tale. In Brotherhood, there is only the illusion of character growth as they all have their respective emotional private dialogues, but these don't wallow past melodrama and towards episode 60, the elrics, mainly ed, are still the self righteous naive kids as they were when they started their journey. They don't murder under any circumstance for one but that morality is never explored because that's too much thinking and moral ambiguity confuses the audience I guess. In the original FMA, Ed had to resort to murder because of the situation and as dark as it was, the maturity was visible and there was a lot to be taken from that experience. \nOften times moral themes in this anime don't get explored beyond \"X is wrong so don't do it!\" just like that annoying scene towards the end (spoiler)where everyone tells Mustang he'll become a different person if he takes his satisfying revenge on the homunculus who's committed multiple unforgivable crimes against humanity, but never goes into depth about the nature of revenge or why Roy will become evil if he takes vengeance in this instance. The nature of Roy's revenge wasn't even an explored theme until this moment, and all of a sudden everyone gets on envy's side and turns their teeth on Roy for no other reason but to tell kids on the other side that acts like this is bad because it turns you into a fiend for some reason. Was I not the only one shouting for them to end envy's life already? This was after the blunder of them not ending one of the world's most dangerous beings before by \"putting him in a jar and giving it to a girl to be taken on a far journey\" without assessing all the risks properly. The homunculi were dehumanized in contrast to the original FMA and made completely unsympathetic (save wrath and old greed) , and we are suppose to sympathize for them at the end for some reason when they were made to barely unlikable? It seems like everyone protects envy throughout the plot. There is \"explaining morality through well written actions and subtext\" and there is \"preachy\" Brotherhood is definitely on the side of preachy.\nMustang as well as everyone else's involvement in the Ishballan war was also not exposed enough I felt. There was not enough psychological explorations on that dark. evil event in history. In the original, there were enough time dedicated to show us the gravity of what happens during war, specifically the massacre of innocents and the guilt state alchemists have to bear, but all that was glossed over in brotherhood, and I felt the weight of war in general was not conveyed well at all when the anime had multiple opportunities to do so. (not just the ishballan war, but the civil battle at the end as well) and instead, we get shallow melodrama, plenty of light comedic relief, and not much food for the mind for us to ponder on. It feels like at times, the anime is almost afraid to be depressing. Compare Hughe's death sequence in both versions and tell me the one in brotherhood has more of an emotional impact. \nSpeaking of comedic relief, the chibi comedy moments in this anime really ruined a lot of potential serious moments. Often times, there was too much light relieving, there was nothing left to relieve but we get comedic relief'ed anyways. The atmospheric tones was much too inconsistent at key times where the director doesn't grip you in any major emotion for a significant amount of time.  For an anime which uses so much comedy, FMAB suffers from the curse of just not being funny. I get it, Edward doesn't like to be called short, ok, I had a chuckle the first couple of times it was mentioned, but for the gag to be in almost every other episode was just straight overkill. I found laughter more in the subtler gags such as ed's terrible design sense. \n\nAnother naive and convenient moment was when all of kimblee's men happened to be good guys. They needed someone to rescue ed and be dependable, so hey, the two chimeras who were just trying to kill him a minute ago turns out to be genuinely good people because we'd have a dead main character otherwise. They couldn't kill the two chimeras in the room with scar who were tied up because the anime isn't dark enough to do that, so hey, Al trusted them at their word and they happened to be good people incapable of betrayal because everyone has good in their heart and just need to be trusted and the world is a great and simple place just like that! and just like that two allies were added to the roster out of nowhere because Arakawa couldn't write herself out of that predicament any other way.. changes of hearts are not gradual and realistic, but are rather handed out like Jesus pamphlets. Scar didn't have a second thought when the elders in his tribe whom he trusts questioned his actions, but switches sides just like that when he meets an ishballan soldier for the first time? I'm just suppose to buy that and go along? \nThe author also ignores too many possibilities regarding the use of alchemy while writing this. In an anime about alchemy, you'd think it'd be used more. When Al and Marco's car got a flat tire at the end, where was alchemy? when ed and gang was fighting hoards of zombie homunculi, where was the alchemy to simply bind them to the ground or wall? when the gold toothed doctor was taking his sweet time to draw a transmutation circle, where was the simple attempt to clap the ground to disrupt it? These were all techniques shown to be utilized in earlier episodes but not used so the plot could unravel at a contrived pace which makes questionable sense. \nWhat the anime excels in is the fluidity of fight scenes, and the masterful animation with fine attention to detail all throughout, to the point where we can see the scar on Roy's hand healing scene by scene, episode by episode. I found characters in general to be paper thin and ill characterized because the episodes were more plot concentrated (but then again so was geass, but it dedicated enough time to character exposition at the same time) .I really wanted to like brotherhood...but really walked out feeling I just watched an above mediocre shonen which doesn't break the chains of its genre down to the last cheesy, sappy line uttered by its protagonist at the end. \n        "},

The story is pretty simple, it's on MAL so I'm not explaining it. However, I will say this, this anime is sad. You wouldn't expect it from seeing the title or a picture. But this anime is as sad as Clannad: After Story or any other anime that tries to be emotional. I recently rewatched this anime, and I experienced the train ride I had. This anime has so many unexpected moments, especially towards the end. SPOILERS AHEAD: I think that Hughes should have had a bit more screen\n          \n        time, don't get me wrong I want to say that I cried. But the thing that made me sad were the reactions of the other characters with hughes dying. They made the aftermath perfect, but before that,9/10. A bit more and it would be perfect. You learn a lot of things in this anime, They apply to real world situations. Let's face it, when we wish for something big, we always sacrifice something. Like \"I wish for Hoenn to be remade\" Your wish comes true but you lose hope halfway. The characters were very enjoyable, the villains were great as well, Animation and Sound, perfect. Overall, my rating would be 9.9/10 which I would say is near perfect. This anime is incredible, and everyone should watch it. I may be a bit too much of a fanboy, but trust me, you'll love it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=54,   ["text"]="                          \n    *Spoiler Warning\nAside from the usual everyday anime Art and Sound standard(of which most animes pass anyways), there are essentially three main factors that I see as important in Anime:\n1. Complexity(detail) (which adds Depth)\na. Characters\nb. Plot\nc. Setting\n2. Progress (which adds Depth)\na. Character Development\nb. Plot Development\nc. Shifts of Setting\n3. Novelty (which, again, adds Depth)\na. Characters\nI. Personality\nb. Setting\nc. Plot\n--------\n1. Complexity(detail)\nIt's understandable that because FMA: Brotherhood paid attention to its simple-minded viewers(readers), the resulting complexity of the entirety of the anime would turn out bland. The characters were too simple, particular the main characters. The plot was horrendously predictable after 3-4 episodes and then there was the lack of\n          \n        focus in the setting. We see an icy place, dessert place, and then there's the ordinary regions where the main characters dwell.\na. Character\nEdward Elric, supposed talented alchemist(or close), with a terrible past. He is strong-willed but at the same time childish. He gets very attached to acquainted \"war\" victims and is always affected by the past. He uses automail(right arm and left leg) and alchemy to fight his way through almost everything. *At first, He hates his father*. He wants to bring back his and his brother's bodies. That's it. No deep personal philosophy. No internal struggle. No moral ambiguity. No split \"demonic\" personality. No subconscious complications. No crazy stuff. No bullshit. He just does what he feels is right. True, Ed experiences things such as guilt and sorrow because of the things he feels as mistakes. He consistently feels regretful for trying to transmute her own mother, and his own dad accused him for actually just being a coward. Nevertheless, said reaction and thoughts are way too simple. In the end, the show just forces the viewer and Edward to just swallow everything and move on. \nAlphonse Elric. I actually preferred this guy over his brother. I mean think about the psychology of a character stuck on an empty armor? Think about its implications. I also liked the idea that Alphonse is naive yet inhumanely able. He doesn't have to eat or sleep and is almost immortal. (though arguable since it was mentioned that there is a possibility that the armor would reject his soul eventually.) Link \"naive\" to his actual physicality. His main vulnerability is still an internal idea---the seal transcribed within his metal body. The only problem with the character is the lack of focus on his own thoughts and so on. The lack of exploration in his psychology. There was one episode that showed Al's doubt of his own existence, but this wasn't clearly detailed enough.\nB. Plot***\nNot much to say here. Mother dies. They become state alchemist. Look for philosopher's stone. (How are they even allowed the time?) *They meet homunculus. They save everyone from homunculus at the same time they get their bodies back. That's it. They should've at least included Lin's \"chinese struggle\" and absorbed the surrounding nations within the plot.*\nC. Setting \nAutomails? Interesting idea. Problem: Detail, no elaboration.\nHow many nations were there? I only remember desert, snow, and the rest of the dullness. Where is the economy?\nAlchemy. The main idea of the show. Quite elaborate in terms of \"the gate\", \"immortality\", and other plot-devices. Problem: How much variety of alchemy did Ed and Al actually use? Move rocks and move more rocks. Mustang did fire tricks. Where are the complicated algorithms? The \"super moves\"? The classification of alchemy? There were mentions of \"eastern alchemy\", \"western alchemy\"; \"comprehension, deconstruction, reconstruction\"; \"equal exchange\" but these things weren't sufficiently fused and utilized as a basis for a unique battle system. sigh.\n2. Progress***\n***Ok. What happened again? They walk everywhere and found out that what they were looking for was right beneath their city and that it's sourced out of human souls? How did they change physically and mentally? ***\nA. Character Development\nHow much did Ed grow? How much did his personality go from A to B? How much did his height go from A to B? Ask yourself.\nHow much did Al grow? After experiencing all those moments, you'd think they'd have a more bad-ass versions of themselves...\nI mean at least change the character's appearances. Transmute Al's armor into some flexible form or cut Ed's hair. \nB. Plot Development\nWhen I said I already knew the outcome after 3-4 episodes, I wasn't kidding. Maybe that's exactly why I felt there wasn't much change. These \"homunculus\" just won't die. They keep coming back and it's like a show of power-puff girls where the girls continuously fight their arch-nemesis's. And don't even get me started on the shallowness of the homunculus'. (though I particularly liked Envy and his end.) Almost nothing, aside from what was already known, was happening. They found out about city's secret and they go back to their traveling and meeting new friends and then they go back traveling and finally they decided to finish the job.\nC. Shift of Setting\nI guess I shouldn't have expected One Piece. There were some interesting places such as the destroyed kingdom or the northern camp but almost everything happened in the same region.\n3. Novelty\nAlchemy and Automail(Shounen) is an interesting combination. If I hadn't watched the first anime, It wouldn't better. Not really. They give you interesting general ideas and they stop there. More details would have produced more novelty. Character-wise, the two had too normal personalities. Interestingly enough, the flashbacks had a more novel point of view than the original. \nA. Characters\nWhat would have really gotten well was if their circumstances actually shaped a plenty of their personalities. The loss body parts didn't serve much meaning in terms of their character build up. What I saw was stubborn kid and naive brother. How swell...\nB. Setting\nGood General Idea - Not detailed = meaningless.\nC. Plot\nNovel in general but the lack of detail lessens the entire novelty. \n---\nClearly not for CPN(character, progress, novelty)-oriented individuals. \n\n"},

The story will make you shed some tears for unexpected people and humanoids, feel sorry for murderous guys, even if you hated them, you will feel empathy for their reasons of being like that, the ending was good, with a final scene of a photo that i liked and that's why i think the story is outstanding.\n[b][u]Art & Animation[/u][/b]\nThe art style was not amazing but it sure was very good and the animation too, with great fight scenes but sometimes those fight scenes and art style were dropping quality at certain scenes the character design is not my favorite but it was good, i think the FMA from early 2000 had a better animation and i only saw some eps. when it was aired in CN but in general it was very good.\n[b][u]Sound[/u][/b]\nThe background music is really good the same can be said about the first OP that has beautiful vocals and reminded me of Maoyuu's OP, the first ED was good too, the rest were meh, too many OPs and EDs, for me that amount was unnecessary and they give spoilers, the VA was great, if it wasn't for that amount of OPs and EDs the sound could have been outstanding but for that it's just great.\n[b][u]Character[/u][/b]\nThe amount of great and outstanding characters is high, everyone is interesting and great villains that are despicable but somehow the creator made you care for them.\n-Edward Elric is the big brother of Alphonse, who may not look strong but he is despite his inmature personality and his anger at everyone who calls him little; He's good hearted and always wants to save people.\n-Alphonse Elric is the little brother, more mature but at the same time could be more naive than Ed, he's even more kind hearted than Ed.\n-Winry is like the little or at times big ''sister'' of the Elric brothers kicking their asses when they get in trouble or creating trouble for them.\n-Izumi Curtis is the sensei that teached alchemy to Ed and Al and she beat the life out of them, she is a great character.\n-Roy Mustang is the one who started the brothers to be statal alchemists and a great one of the most powerful characters but at the same time useless under water, he is a great leader aiming to be the new Fuhrer so he can help and protect people.\n-Scar is an Ishvalith who is seeking revenge against every statal alchemist that was or wasn't involved in the Ishvalith war, a powerful character.\n-Yao Ling is great full of ambition and at the same time determination of reaching his goal of becoming the Emperor of Xing no matter what, friendly and deadly, he will be a real friend to Ed, and a bother to him.\n-May Chang is a little girl that is seeking for the same thing that Ling, to become the Ruler of Xing.\n-Kimblee was a little disappointing because i thought he was going to be more dangerous than what he looked or what he did, he was the only let down of a character.\n-Van Hohenheim is the father of the Elric's and someone with a though past and that past leads him to abandon his family, he's one great character.\nAnd a big amount of great characters, like the Armstrong family, Hugh Maes, the various Chimeras, Greed, Hawkeye, Prof. Marcoh, Envy, Father, King Bradley, Bucaneer, Miles and the list goes and goes, is a big great cast of memorable outstanding characters.\n[b][u]Enjoyment[/u][/b]\nThis is for me a flawed masterpiece, i recognize like any other the flaws but i have to follow the enjoyment i had, it was superb, it was outstanding, i was never bored and kept watching the next eps. when i could, the ending was good but i wanted more even with a good conclusion.\n        "},

Quickly, my fears about this remake were dispelled and I was hooked. Four days and 64 episodes later, I'm at the end and I'm blown away.\nI do strongly suggest you watch FMA before moving onto Brotherhood.

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=32,   ["text"]="                          \n    Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a pretty beloved show on MAL and within the anime scene in general.  Personally, while I enjoyed it, I don't necessarily think it is the best thing since sliced bread.  It kept me entertained, and even at times made me feel an emotion or two, but the slow start and sometimes dragging plot didn't necessarily keep me thinking about watching the next episode when I was busy with other activities.  That being said, it is certainly worth a watch through at least once if you have the stomach for a 60+ episode series!  Let's get into the\n          \n        breakdown.\nStory (8/10) - I think the story was fairly well done.  It wasn't groundbreaking and it didn't necessarily have a lot of \"oh snap!\" moments, but it executed quite well.  Its exposition was usually laser focused on the characters and history that mattered, the plot was consistently moved forward to the inevitable conclusion, and you did get a sense of something grander going on.  It didn't waste your time with a ton of filler, and you could see this spiderweb of deception in every corner of the world.  The events were logical, believable, and often relateable despite being set in a fantastical world of magic, with problems often mirroring very real life scenarios.\nIt also handled flashbacks remarkably well I think.  Many shows just drag flashbacks on and on.  FMA:B kept them quick and relevant.  It actually made me enjoy them and made me curious about the backstory rather than beating me over the head with historical exposition to justify everything.  My only real complaint with the story was how it dragged at the beginning while it was setting up the spider-webbing for the over-arching grand scheme.  It took nearly 20 episodes to get going, but once it did get going, it took off at a brisk run.  It was a significant enough annoyance to me though that I can't give the story a 9 despite its pretty quality execution.\nArt (7/10) - The art was certainly above average, but it didn't really stand out in any particular way to me.  It was consistently solid, with no mistakes, but not beautiful.  It served its purpose and allowed you to immerse yourself in the world, but was short of being truly captivating.  There were definitely brief moments where it came close to being stunning though, and I have to give credit for the very eye-catching design of Pride (hah, I made a funny!).\nSound (5/10) - I think the sound for this show was its weakest quality.  It felt to me like it was merely adequate.  It served its purpose, but nothing really was memorable to me from the soundtrack to the voicing.  My personal taste may be heavily colouring my opinion here, but I really just found the sound as action-average as any J-Pop intro to a RomCom or Ecchi.\nCharacters (8/10) - Along with the story, the characters were quite well handled.  They were all very standard stereotypes, but each had their own unique quirks and motivations to keep them interesting.  I wouldn't say any were particularly deep, but there were certainly moments where I would feel for a couple characters.  I enjoyed learning about all their backstories, and I enjoyed that they all walked their own paths, or at least tried to until they were often drawn back together by fate.  Their independence was actually relateable instead of the usual excessive aloofness of \"independent\" characters in many other shows.  They genuinely felt like individuals rather than cogs in a big machine.\nEnjoyment (7/10) - At my first foray into this series, I honestly have to say I was pretty \"meh\" about it.  Up until about episode 18 for me, the story dragged along as it tried to set everything up and introduce all the main players.  It sagged under the weight of it and I often found myself thinking of other things I could be doing while watching.   It was still enjoyable... just not really compelling.  Starting out this was a 5/10 for me.  After episode 18 though, the show finally kicked it into gear and I found my enjoyment increased *measurably*.  Middle of the show it was a 6/10 and by the end it landed a 7.  It's worth watching if you can make it to the end, especially considering the pleasant and fulfilling ending that so many action anime lack these days.  If I was my younger self, I could see myself having enjoyed it even more.  I can't say I'll rewatch it, by I'm certainly glad I've seen it.\nSo overall I give \"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\" a 7/10.  It was almost an 8, but not quite.  Not because it did anything wrong, but more that it didn't try to push itself at all and stayed in its comfort-zone.  The story was interesting enough though and the characters did often elicit some compassion from me.  If you're reading this to figure out if you should watch this show, then sure, you'll probably find something in it worth your time (as long as you are good with 60+ episodes), but be careful not to go into it with too much hype in mind.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=44,   ["text"]="                          \n    If there's one programme out there which a tad frustrating for me, it's Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I don't know about you, but I'm absolutely sick of seeing reviews giving this show a 10/10. Don't get me wrong though, I absolutely adore Fullmetal Alchemist as a whole and I do believe that the adventures of Edward and Alphonse should be viewed by all at some point. But it's really the fans' reaction to this show that drive me up a wall. At its core, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a great show that does a lot of things right (and I do mean a LOT of shit\n          \n        right) but ends up getting some shit wrong along the way as well.\nOf course, it's important to understand why this show was made before I get started with the actual review itself. Before Brotherhood ever existed, there was the first Fullmetal Alchemist TV series: a loose adaptation of the manga which eventually broke away from the source material in order to tell its own story. Now, this was important for two reasons. The first is because at the time of the first series' creation, there weren't that many chapters there to adapt so either Bones had to wing it or Arakawa had to sacrifice her creative integrity and succumb to both publisher deadlines AND studio pressure as well.\nThe second reason is the most important: because the first series branched off and became its own entity, that gave Hiromu Arakawa much more time to flesh out the manga's universe and go in the direction she so chooses without having to worry about things like deadlines as much. Talk shit all you want about the first TV series, but just keep in mind that without the first TV series, the manga as we know it right now would be vastly different and Brotherhood would in all likelihood not exist. Of course, the fact that the circumstances behind this show's creation rely so heavily on what went down in the first show does come back to bite Brotherhood in the ass. How so?\nWell for one thing, the first 15 episodes of Brotherhood are rather... \"rushed,\" I guess? Now, this was actually a stylistic choice on the part of Bones since the logic at the time of creation was that the vast majority of people who are watching this show would have already watched the 2003 series first so they didn't want to bore returning viewers by showing them the same stuff they saw before. While that certainly is a respectable goal, there's only one little problem with that logic: this is supposed to be a REBOOT of the anime series. If you're going to reboot something, any prior entries in the franchise shouldn't even be factored into the equation.\nNow granted, I did complete Brotherhood first before going on to complete the 2003 series and nothing really seemed out-of-place, but upon re-watching after completing the 2003 series... it just didn't really feel the same. For instance, there's the whole ordeal with Nina Tucker. If you've spent ANY amount of time around the FMA fandom, you should have *some* idea that what happens to this 4-year-old girl is NOT pretty. In the 2003 series however, the Tucker family's role was expanded and we got to see more of Nina before \"it\" happened (and let me just say that the entire thing was fucking depressing after \"it\" happened).\nIn Brotherhood... Nina is just around for one episode and after tragedy befalls her, she's apparently one of the driving forces behind Edward and Alphonse's goals of becoming better alchemists. Let me get this straight: a little girl that you didn't even know for more than a week is going to be one of the driving forces behind our lead protagonists' goals for the entire series' run? Yeah... I'm not buying it. Yes, what happened to her is sad but I find it incredibly hard to believe that an incident like that to someone that Ed and Al barely knew would have THAT much of an impact on them. There are WAY more examples like that than I let on, by the way. I just don't feel like covering them all since that's far too much work on my end.\nAnother aspect about Brotherhood I take umbrage with is the comedy. To put it short, I don't really care much for Hiromu Arakawa's chibi-style humour since it just takes me out of the seriousness of the moment and just kills the mood altogether in a vein similar to Kuroshitsuji. Of course, that's not really a fair comparison since Bones is a far more competent studio than A-1 Pictures but it's still something to be mentioned. You can only imagine my frustration whenever I saw Ed go into chibi mode right after some intense action or a relatively serious moment goes down. I mean, yeah it gets a quiet chuckle out of me but do you really have to resort to THAT style of humour to elicit a laugh or two out of the viewers? Come on...\nThe last thing that I don't really have a lot of praise for is the fact that despite the fact that it's definitely a cut above its competition in the battle shonen genre, it still FEELS like a battle shonen series in all the wrong ways from time to time. Don't get me wrong, Hiromu Arakawa really put in a lot of thought and effort into writing up the story and the characters but you can just tell where she got lazy and resorted to using some of the same clichés that plague other battle shonen anime/manga series. They're few and far between, but when they pop up, chances are that you'll instinctively face-palm (especially if there's some bullshit monologue about friendship; I'm looking at you, final fight between Envy and Roy Mustang >_>).\nNow with all that ugliness out of the way, let's talk positives because hot DAMN is there a lot of praise to give this show. When it comes down to world-building, Hiromu Arakawa is all but unmatched. The world that Brotherhood is set in is masterfully crafted, with a lot of detail put into the locations that each part of the story takes place in. It's quite evident that the biggest reason why the manga took so long to complete would be that Hiromu Arakawa spent a great deal of time fleshing out the finer details of the locations that she brings up. In fact, the only works that I can think of that would be on equal or better footing than Brotherhood would be the likes of Harry Potter, Hunter x Hunter, One Piece, and Legend of the Galactic Heroes.\nAnother thing that Brotherhood has going for it is the adventure. I don't know about you, but I always found myself enamoured with the new locations and such that Ed and Al would come across on their journeys. From Lior to Fort Briggs and even the ruins of Xerxes, I never cease to find myself captivated by what's going on. What's more is that the adventure from start to finish (with the exception of the first 15 episodes) is incredibly well-paced. No segment of the adventure feels drawn out to the point of being tedious or rushed to the point where nothing of substance actually happens and that segment could've easily been cut out. Each part of the narrative feels necessary to the plot and is given just enough time to make its impact before we move on to the next part of the story.\nSpeaking of which, one of the biggest complaints I see people lodging against the 2003 series is its supposed lack of action. Well Brotherhood makes up for that supposed weakness in full force. At its core, the Fullmetal Alchemist manga is a battle shonen manga and what battle shonen adaptation would be complete without epic fights? All the fights in Brotherhood are perfectly timed, so they're not hideously drawn nor are they dissatisfyingly short. What's more is that battles are only present in episodes where a fight NEEDS to go down for the sake of plot, so there are no pointless fights thrown in for the hell of it so the fights themselves don't detract from the story in the slightest.\nBattles, adventures, and a masterfully crafted setting aren't the only thing that Brotherhood has going for it. Surprising though it may be, battle shonen series are actually able to have some damn good drama thrown into the mix which is more than capable of having you emotionally involved with what's going on and that's one of the hallmarks surrounding Fullmetal Alchemist as a whole. Whilst the focus of Brotherhood is more on the adventure than it is the drama, that doesn't stop the show from being able to have more than its fair share of compelling and emotionally involving moments. \nThe last thing that I want to talk about story-wise before I move on to the characters is the ending. The biggest reason why the 2003 series is so divisive amongst FMA fans as a whole is how the series itself actually concluded. The 2003 series' original conclusion was nothing short of bitter-sweet, with a MUCH heavier emphasis on the bitter than the sweet, even in the sequel movie Conqueror of Shamballah. Brotherhood's ending is the exact opposite. It is a happy ending in every sense of the word which fans found INFINITELY more satisfying than what was there previously. As the great Nobuhiro Watsuki said, shonen series are ultimately comics meant for boys and they should have happy endings. Why? Well... boys are young. Save the depressing shit for when they're older and develop a nasty drinking problem.\nIf there's one area where Fullmetal Alchemist will always succeed (regardless of incarnation), it would definitely have to be with the characters. Of course with that said, Brotherhood is a more event-driven programme rather than character-driven so character development isn't really a priority. For example, Ed and Al more or less remain the same throughout their entire ordeal. They don't degenerate as individuals, yet they also don't improve or even change in any notable way throughout the entire show's run. Regardless, Ed's characterisation is absolutely spectacular.\nWhat I really love about Ed's characterisation is the fact that despite going through a great deal of strife in his life, he knows how to laugh and have fun. He rebels against authority from time to time, he and Al fight like brothers do, he has childish outbursts from time to time, etc. What I'm getting at is that despite all of the crap he's gone through, he still behaves like a teenager would. In many ways, Ed reminds me of Peter Parker from the Ultmate Spider-Man comics and that resemblance really does boost him up several notches on my likeability meter. His dynamic with Alphonse is also something that I enjoy quite a bit because it feels a bit like Terry McGinnis/Maxine Gibson's relationship from Batman Beyond.\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said about Alphonse. Throughout the course of Fullmetal Alchemist (this applies to the manga and both TV series), Alphonse more or less remains static throughout the entire show's run and doesn't get any characterisation beyond functioning as the Maxine Gibson to Edward's Terry MicGinnis and being the gentle giant/naive younger sibling. Any sort of subplot that seemed like it would add more to his character don't really play out as such so we're basically back to where we started. Take the part where Al doubts his own humanity for instance. You'd think that would be like a REALLY huge thing, but no... it gets resolved within 1-2 episodes and Al is back to re-transmuting Ed's soul once Winry knocks it out of Ed's body with her wrench... oh well, such is life.\nThe secondary characters in Fullmetal Alchemist have always been of variable quality, and the same remains true in Brotherhood (perhaps even more so because Brotherhood has a MUCH larger supporting cast). Some characters like Roy Mustang, Greed, Scar, Father, and Fuhrer Bradley are REALLY well-written with their own degrees of complexity while others like Lust, Sloth, and Gluttony didn't really have much to their personality aside from being antagonists. I know that this shit is to be expected, but Hiromu Arakawa REALLY outdid herself when it came down to all this other stuff, and when I don't see that level of quality maintained throughout the work, it just leaves me feeling empty inside. \nOn the technical side of things, Brotherhood is definitely among the best-looking shows that Bones has ever produced, but this is obviously to be expected. Bones is no slouch when it comes down to visual quality. Hell, even shows that they created more than a decade ago like RahXephon and Wolf's Rain hold up pretty damn well in 2014. If I had to sum up my thoughts on the visuals, I'd have to say that Brotherhood's aesthetics are more or less identical to the 2003 show's, but refined. Character designs are more in-line with the manga's, improvements in animation technology allow for less still frames/talking heads present, and what's more is that there's a good deal more background animation present. Speaking of which, Brotherhood's action is bar none some of the most enthralling that I've ever seen in ANY shonen anime.\nAnother area where Brotherhood excels are in the OPs/EDs. It's rare for me to find an anime that I enjoy have multiple openings, all of which that I actually do like. Personally, I'm biased toward the 5th OP, as it's the opening that really just sets the stage perfectly for the final few episodes of Brotherhood. It has this atmosphere about it where everyone's weary and yet they're so close to their goal that they can't just give up now and that what I'm about to watch really is the home stretch. ED-wise, I'm biased toward the 1st ED because of the animation style as it's all-chibi artwork animated as if it were drawn in pencil with a great track playing over it. That actually brings me over to the audio side of the spectrum.\nAudio-wise, Brotherhood doesn't disappoint... asterisk. Now there is one complaint that I have with the OST but that's mostly because the 2003 show's OST is among my all-time favourite anime OSTs and yet Brotherhood just didn't live up to my expectations upon re-watch. This is a similar problem that I had with Hellsing Ultimate in the sense that its predecessor's OST is superior to my ears than the OST that we have for the reboot despite the fact that the one present is REALLY good stuff. There wasn't much in the way of background music that stood out, although it did serve as a complement to whatever was going on and there wasn't anything that I personally found inappropriate for the moment at hand. My favourite OP/ED themes are \"Rain\" and \"Uso\" by SID respectively, just so I can get that out of the way.\nDub-wise, Funimation steps up to the plate and delivers in full force. The cast is almost identical to the 2003 series' dub (which is one of my all-time favourite Funimation dubs, by the way), save for certain characters because let's face it: there's no way you can get the same people to work on a project they had a hand in 5-6 years ago all in one place. The most noticeable changes to the cast are Maxey Whitehead replacing Aaron Dismuke as Alphonse, Troy Baker replacing Chris Patton as Greed, J. Michael Tatum replacing Dameon Clark as Scar, and John Swasey aka Gendo Ikari replacing Scott McNeil as Hohenheim.\nI can safely say that Whitehead, Baker, Tatum, and Swasey all do an excellent job with the roles they were given and are on-par if not better than their predecessors... although I'm biased toward Chris Patton's version of Greed for... reasons. The rest of the dub is spot-on. Vic Mignonga, Travis Willingham, Caitlin Glass, Colleen Clinkenbeard, Laura Bailey, and everyone else who had a hand to play in this dub did an absolutely spectacular job. I'd like to hear dub haters try and talk shit about this dub, because I can't find anything wrong with it.\nFinal thoughts? Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a shining example of what an adaptation SHOULD do, and yet it baffles me as to how people can consider this to be the best anime ever and something that is infinitely superior to the 2003 series. Despite my preference of the 2003 series, I'd say that they're equals. It's not often we get TWO adaptations which have VERY well-written plots and if you really are a manga purist, you can view the 2003 series as an alternate universe interpretation. Regardless, I absolutely enjoyed watching Brotherhood and I look forward to the day where I can own a DVD/Blu-ray combo pack of the entire show. Both the 2003 series and Brotherhood should be watched by all and both deserve a special place on your shelf of interesting items.\nWith that said, I'm out. Feedback is always welcome, as are monetary contributions and offerings of food, drinks, chromosomes and fancy clothes to the Dark Lord Chin-Chin.\n        "},

Please bare with me here.\nStory-10\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (FMAB) has an fantastic story. Its pacing at first is faster then I'd expect, since the '03 FMA's first few episodes were some of its most developing, but it quickly makes up for any lack of development later on in the show. It's also has the perfect length at 64 episodes, as if it were any shorter, I'd personally think it was a bit too short, and if it were any longer, too long. Everything is great, from the emotional beginning to the truly epic ending.\nArt-9\nFMA:B is animated gorgeously. Anything from its talking scenes, to\n          \n        drama scenes, to action scenes, all look great.\nSound-9\nI'm going to get this out of the way right now: I loved every single one of these openings/endings. They were all great songs that fit the point of the show they were at. As for the OST, its still great, but I really sense that they used the same tracks over more times than I'd like.\nI watched FMA:B both subbed and dubbed, and I actually have to say that I like the dub more than the sub. Vic Mignogna  does a perfect job as Edward, and everyone else does great returning to their older Characters from FMA '03.\nCharacters-10 \nThe characters is definitely one of FMA:B's strong suits in my opinion. You feel for every character, main or side, villain or hero. All characters are fleshed out and feel real. In two different episodes, you can see Edward actually grow taller, and that's TRUE character development.\nEnjoyment-10\nI truly love this anime. It made me laugh, smile, tear up, made me full adrenaline, and all at once sometimes. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is my favorite anime, and probably always will be. It truly deserves everyone's enjoyment.\nOverall: 9.5/10\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=40,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Let me start by saying this: This review is only helpful if you haven't seen the first FMA. Shocking, I know, but people like this do exist.\nAlright, I've seen 12 episodes of FMA Brotherhood.\n1) The animation is stellar, the action is gorgeous, and scene arrangement ensure a smooth, liquid pacing that ensures you're never bored.\n2) The music, the voice actors, everything is great. I can't review sound - go watch and listen!\n3) The characters are fantastic.  The only character I hate is Ed, shockingly enough.  I know, how can you enjoy a series and hate the main character? As far as I can\n          \n        tell, Ed is the male equivalent of a Tsundere, meaning as they develop how he actually thinks and feels, I'll grow to love him.  I hope.\nThe other characters, and there are a lot of them, carry the show.  Someone is constantly looking to have something done or has some agenda, and characters with conflicting agendas manifest naturally.  This makes for a gorgeous multi-linked plot that is getting both hectic but staying steady and clear.\n4) Story: FMA Brotherhood is a show about two brothers making a mistake and then trying to fix it.  At least, on the surface.  It becomes rapidly clear a whole lot of other things are going on, and these things will doubtless lead our intrepid heroes down down down the rabbit hole until we find ourselves at the heart of some crazy hair brained world reaching plot.  Or at least, that is my anticipation.\nThe brotherhood dynamic, as cited in the title, actually doesn't seem like the critical plot focus to me thus far.  It plays an integral role, and parts along the way are definitely fleshing it out, but the real enjoyment from the series lies in the varied assortment of individuals you are meeting along the way.  I've read some of the other reviews, and they state these characters aren't being fleshed out enough.  Given the fact that the series hasn't ended yet, I'm desperately hoping this is true!  Good story telling is done by slowly shaving down to the core of what characters are.  Imagine my surprise in Ep. 11 to discover Roy Mustang isn't secretly a bad guy, in spite of how he is originally portrayed, and how I originally perceived him to be.  At this critical moment for him, my feelings about him completely toggled over to one where, hey, I know exactly who this guy is, and I like him a lot more for it.\n5) Enjoyment: The show makes me lose sleep waiting for it to come out to view.  That should indicate just how much I love it so far.  I will say this: As long as they keep the quick pace up and keep chipping away at the truth, Brotherhood will become a stellar classic, making people wonder why there was any doubt as to where it was going.\nI compare its pacing, and plot advancement solely to Code Geass for how quick and consistent it runs.\n***I've just now obtained FMA (the original) and started to watch it, struggled through about 12 episodes, and threw in the towel. It was boring, Brotherhood has spoiled me.  I hope this doesn't offend original viewers, but all that other stuff in there is fluff to what Brotherhood is portraying as plot critical, and since my mind is full of Brotherhood thoughts, well...\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=39,   ["text"]="                          \n    Brotherhood boasts that it follows the mangas story more closely than the previous anime adaptation, and it does.  However the actual quality of the anime itself is far poorer.  What realy made FMA's previous anime adaptation so successfull was the overall direction of the anime.  The quality of shots used in this anime and the art itself is inferior to the original anime.  Obviously it is still highly enjoyable due to the story behind it, but the anime seems overhyped.  People feel pressured to believe thats its better due to the story being more accuratly followed.  This is not\n          \n        the way to think.  The anime suffered hugely at first as well, as it attempted to catch up to the manga, thus rushing through over half of the story.  The sound was not bad, but then again it was not that good.\nFMA fanatics should enjoy this as it follows the manga more closely, however if you have not read the manga then I would reccomend the original series, as in all honesty it is of much better quality.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=38,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Anyone who does not like Deus Ex Machina and plot points that seem to be hastily shoved into place should not watch this Anime. And any fans of the original FMA Anime should tread carefully. While this is still a fairly good show there are many things that just don't work.\nIt's always a shame to see good characters go to waste. Ed and Al are two interesting kids who will do no growing or learning over the course of 64 episodes, they began and end their journey the same as they started it albeit with a varying degree of limbs. \nOur story centers around a\n          \n        generic good vs evil plot, where those that fall under the banner of evil show no real reasons or proper motivations for their actions aside from the authors needing a villain. Why do the homonculi want to help Father? Because a villain needs henchmen. Why does the Dwarf in the Flask want power? Because why not.  It's a shame the story is such lackluster since the world it's built in feels so vivid and inviting. \nBut even a greater shame then the villains would have to be the supporting cast of the good guys. Ed and Al don't develop or change but they are still interesting, the same can not be said for their companions. An odd medley of alchemists, soldiers, and chimera all fighting for the greater good and barely an interesting one among them. If you want to watch this series and find some good characterization, pay attention to Ling and Greed. They are the only characters that actually seem to grow, change, and have real conflict within this story.\nAs a final point I would like to say that while both FMA and FMA:B use death as a major driving force for characters FMA:B can almost be laughed at for even attempting this. Characters with no actual characterization are killed off and we are expected to see this as a shame and a reasonable excuse for a major characters actions. If your flashback scene for a character can only consist of \"Hello, I'm [Name].\" and two other boring statements with no real barring, then this character should never be used to develop major plot points.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=37,   ["text"]="                          \n    When the original Fullmetal Alchemist series released, it was praised as one of the greatest anime ever. This series wasn't created to replace that position, but as more people read the continuing manga version of the story, more people likely wished for an animated series featuring that original plot. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood seems to be that original story, yet I couldn't confirm it myself as I haven't read the manga and only watched the original series. Many people claim it a strong point that this is the original author's intended direction of the plot, and that may be true, but I would say this specific\n          \n        adaptation of the manga is likely not a good representation of the manga's fame.\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is now praised ahead of the original series and is treated as one of the best anime ever created. I would personally disagree with that point, but not to the extent of calling it bad. This version of Fullmetal Alchemist stands out as one of the most complex shounen tales I have ever witnessed, while still carrying many of the shounen cliches. It has a big budget behind it, despite holding a smaller viewer base on its televised premiere than the original, and that budget shows.\nFrom mentioning budget, I'd first like to cover the audio and visuals of Brotherhood. The visuals are some of the best I've seen and you can really tell it was made by Bones. The show is overflowing with visual attentions to detail that stick between scene transitions, and you will very rarely notice something missing. There are a variety of locations with great levels of detail in their backgrounds, and the animation is always there to serve motion. Despite some of the animation being a bit wonky, the show holds a good amount of great action.\nThe soundtrack leaves a bit more to be desired. While the tracks that do exist are very unique, there isn't enough variety in the tracks available to correctly display every emotion a story like Fullmetal Alchemist needs to convey. The original series had plenty of action-oriented tunes to play, but this version seems to only have about three available and you'll hear them in just about every fight. In a shounen, action-adventure you'd expect more of a priority in that type of soundtrack instead of quieter, less-memorable ones. The soundtrack isn't as orchestrated as the original, and the music sounds very electronic at times, but the soundtrack isn't bad in its own right.\nOn a final note towards budget: The openings/endings of this show are generally above-average, but none really express a feeling of excitement or anticipation and are usually softer, not really catching the feeling of the series. The last ending song was the most memorable by the simple notion that it fit better with what was actually going on in the series at the time. Mentioning timing, it should also be noted that there is quite a lot of odd placements and cut-offs of music in Brotherhood, and there are close to a dozen times when it will even conflict with the emotions you should be having in the story.\nBeyond budget, the \"true\" story of Fullmetal Alchemist is a long and imaginative one. With the length of the manga, I could safely assume that Brotherhood doesn't cover a large percentage of the manga's details. This is where things start to stumble from the potential this series had. In the original series of Fullmetal Alchemist, there was a variety of unconnected problems and issues to deal with that kept things interesting. In Brotherhood, however, the show puts all of its focus onto one, single plot-goal, barely ever straying from that goal. Making a series of over sixty episodes needs some variety or twists to keep things interesting, but Brotherhood severely lacks in that aspect.\nThe first dozen episodes start with an almost episodic nature, speeding through content that correlates with the original series. That could be justified by this being a supplement to the original series, but that only makes Brotherhood less sturdy on its own feet in the process. The show strikes a point shortly where an interesting plot begins. Even at that point the entire outcome of that plot is very predictable, but it serves some intrigue through the encounters it creates. However, it soon begins to drag as characters begin to do less and plan more of how to get from point A to point B in order to head to their predictable destination. There are no twists in this time to bring another rise in interest and the show assumes that one plot is enough. What the original series did to combat that is take what is treated as a secondary plot in Brotherhood (the regaining of Ed and Al's bodies, which is learned at the beginning) and put more focus on it, bringing out more detail and development. Brotherhood even pushes that to the side and fuels itself off of character interaction between a growing list of non-developed characters.\nBrotherhood had two chances to fix this problem with the direction they chose to go. One solution could have been to make the series longer and make more side-plots and more development in other characters to make the viewers care more for them. That would also fix the huge pacing issue that can be seen in the beginning, and throughout most of the show. The second route they could've taken, still focusing on this one plot, is shortening the entire show to about half its length and cutting out unnecessary details.\nInstead, Brotherhood focuses on the technicalities of fixing a large, yet predictable, situation. Choosing that path could still bring some interest if the dialogue was top-notch, but it just isn't at that level in Brotherhood. The planning the characters do to solve obstacles in their path is generally interesting and somewhat smart with the fantasy elements it has in place, but the terminology most of the characters use (in the english dub at least) is generally simple and very particular. You'll be hearing a lot of simple and repeated phrases for describing situations, and that is a large amount of the dialogue. Character interactions don't delve too much within the pasts and minds of each character, and development is barely made. Even the main characters, Ed and Al, almost feel like side characters after the first dozen of rushed episodes.\nSo we have a problem with pacing, a lack of focus towards variety in story and plot, a lack of soundtrack elements to correctly display moods, and I may even say a lack of style. The presentation of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood feels more in tune to getting to the point and rushing the way there. It never takes the time to introduce the viewer to the story and practically acts like a slideshow of what happens here and thereafter. There's barely any clever camera angles or attentions to detail in a consistent and unique style like the original, but there are plenty of details in the technicalities of the leading plot.\nI have a great feeling that the story of the manga had great potential of creating one of the best animated series around, but this attempt just falls short on direction. While the technical aspects of the manga's main plot are likely in place, it seems the director and screenwriter forgot to take into account that they are translating the story to film, not treating the film as the manga. A manga and a show are two different things that have different opportunities to be unique. Although the director of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was involved in the creation of the acclaimed movie \"Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door\", there's a reason that he worked solely on the storyboards.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=23,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Man, I was really late to the party on this one. Every time I saw polls on the best anime shows released, this would be usually top 5, maybe top 3. I remember hearing people talking about this when I was still in school, the type of people who didn't like anime telling me \"yeah, it's pretty good\". After about 6 years of hearing about it, and doubting it, I finally gave it a shot. Holy crap, why didn't I listen to everybody before?\nI went into this knowing nothing about the premise, so the show itself had to tell me how everything worked and keep\n          \n        me interested enough to last something like 64 episodes. 64?! My sweet spot is 26, anything beyond that are a commitment I'm not willing to make.\nThe first episode was one of the best pilots I think I've ever seen, it established so many world rules and characters and really showed off the budget and animation levels I was in store for. I remember thinking \"Woah, this really feels like Avatar: The Last Airbender\" and I grew up with that. As soon as I felt that, I knew I could last 64 episodes easy.\nThe show is relatively simple, there's a form of magic called alchemy that few possess, and there are large territories that are on very poor terms with one another. You're looking at great warriors and really detailed fight scenes. The real heart of this show is the strength of the characters, main and supporting, and the overall arcing story. It deals so well with escalation, never skipping too far ahead too fast as to lose you, but it keeps a quick pace with a lot of well explained mystery that you want to know more. Each section of the story adds foundations to the parts to come, previous pieces of intrigue combine to solve a larger piece of the puzzle. This feels so satisfying to watch, be it discovering the rules of alchemy to who the villain is and what his evil plan becomes.\nThis show can become beautifully dark, from familial deaths of main cast members, to examining how far someone will go for perfection, justice, or even life itself. The villains are wonderfully metaphorical, each being charismatic and deadly, while the heroes are very complex and quite human. Fullmetal really dissects human nature and shows you both the best and the worse of it. What pins this down is a really great soundtrack, the whole thing creates this sort of feeling that just flows into you. You name it, this show probably has it: political instability and invasions, insightful character development across the board, a good sense of humour to lighten the mood just enough that the shocking moments hurt so much worse, amazing fight choreography, a well written love story, mysterious secret societies, redemption arcs for desperate thugs...   It really has so much to offer, each piece well rounded and ready to be enjoyed. I don't know how they fit in so much without it feeling overly complicated or too stuffed, but they did!\nI was an idiot for not checking out this show when people told me about it, because it really is a near perfect piece of entertainment across the board. By the end, I wanted more than 64 episodes, something I never imagined happening. I can't recommend this show more, it's unmissable.\n        "},

The story seems to take place sometime before the first FMA, but it's really hard to tell.\nFrom what I've gathered it's sticking really closely to the manga this time around. As for the overall awesomeness of the animation, its seriously a 10. The action and the fighting are great and the animation is smooth and amazing. \nIt's interesting to see the voice of Urahara as Roy Mustang (one of my fav Bleach characters is ROY?! lol) and Ed and Alphonse are the same\n          \n        as last time. \nSo yeah, based on only seeing the first episode its definitely a must watch in my opinion, but this is coming from a hardcore fan of the first Fullmetal Alchemist.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I held out on watching Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood for a long time, watching other series as I kept the show on my plan to watch list. Now as I finally recently embarked on to watch FMA:B and finished it, I regret not watching it earlier.\nThis is my first review and english is not my native language, so do forgive my rambling about..\n- Story -\nFMA:B's story is truly one of the most unique stories I have seen. Everything at first is so shrouded in mystery and the story is set into motion as the brothers set out on their journey to get their bodies back. You\n          \n        are introduced to many events of the series early on, and all of these are explained as the show goes on. This is where FMA's pacing shines. The story is mostly a very continuous story with flashbacks to the past presented occasionally to further explain the underlying factors that make the show's world what it is in the present. Also character development is very well executed in FMA:B, and it's honestly fun to see Ed growing up as the show progresses. I was also very glad to find that for it's whole run time of 64 episodes, FMA has no filler episodes at all. \n         10/10\n- Art - \nThe art in FMA:B is very good, but it's not the best. The animation is certainly fluid in the action scenes, and even though I was not the biggest fan of the realistic (though well drawn) backgrounds and the at times grey color palette. But it does fit the show. I had a few issues with the very simplified chibi-art joke moments especially at the beginning of the show but, as the show goes on, you get used to them and they appear less often.\n              9/10\n- Sound - \nI have only watched the sub version of FMA:B, so I cannot judge the series from the dub. The voice actors did a great job at portraying the characters and their emotions, and I especially liked Mustang's performance. Edward can sound a little bit annoying at times, and I found it a bit disturbing that their voices had not matured nearly at all towards the end of the series, but that doesn't matter too much. I have to say that FMA:B excelled with its classical OST and outstanding openings. Two of the openings, Again and Period especially stood out for me, Period with it's catchy tune and appealing visuals, and Again with Yui's wonderful voice and maybe some of the best directing in openings to be seen. You will definitely find yourself remembering some of the music used in the show for a long time.\n               9/10\n- Character - \nThe characters are perhaps the best part about FMA:B. Pretty much all the characters are so well written, with distinctive personalities and their own struggles and pasts. None of the main characters are too strong, and we will see them succeed and suffer as much. The main characters', Ed's and Al's arcs are so well rounded that it's just a pleasure to watch unveil. And the rest of the supporting cast was also portrayed in a spectacular fashion, they weren't there just to support the main characters. Also, I find it rare for shows to make such good villains as there are in FMA:B. I'm not sure if I've ever actually felt for a villain as they die, but it happened here. It was interesting to like the villains and hate them as much at the same time.\n10/10\n- Enjoyment - \nFullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a show even non-anime fans would like. It avoids the usual cliches some anime shows tend to use and it will keep you enthralled during its whole run time. FMA:B probably loses some of its enjoyment if one rewatches it, as learning about the world and its events as the show progresses is one of the most enjoyable things about it, but I still wouldn't mind rewatching it. It's a story hard to forget about, and you will find yourself feeling empty after watching it, because it is that fulfilling. \n             10/10\nOverall the show is a 10/10 for me. \n"},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=33,   ["text"]="                          \n    Fullmetal Alchemist, a story about 2 brothers going on a journey in a magical fantasy world, which brings us as the audience closer to the interesting idea of equal trade. “Giving something in order to get something” A very realistic idea but in this universe much more effective. To make a material out of another, a dream of the ancient alchemist to create gold and probably an idea that will occur to us in a distant unknown future. It is an anime I only can look good at. \n7 years after the original anime fascinated many of viewer studio “Bones” decided to make Fullmetal Alchemist\n          \n        again, with slightly better graphics and more accurately to the manga and it seems like that Brotherhood is even better than the original, at least the majority of people on this website think so. \nI think it is quite understandable why the Brotherhood series is more popular and more liked than the original, at least at this website. It is also my biggest problem about it. On the one hand Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood had more action scenes and on the other it had a more complex but better explained storyline. That seems quite good doesn’t it? Well the problem is Brotherhood explains every detail of the story, as if the storywriters think the audience can’t think for themselves. The character constantly reminds you of several things so you absolutely can’t forget them. Half way through an episode it also has to remind you of the anime you are currently watching, with shouting its name out loud, just to make sure. This penetrating need to explain everything goes way beyond normal story explanations. Even though in some cases explaining the story by SHOWING you the story is more enjoyable in many cases it need to be TOLD, especially in anime that are character based and have a lot of conversations involved. Sometimes a story gives you the clue “A” and the clue “B” and you have to come to the conclusion “C”, sometimes it gives you a clue “A” and the conclusion “C” and you can, if you want come to the result “B”.  “Brotherhoods” doesn’t do that, it gives you everything and the character just screams the conclusion out as if they can’t wait until you know their secret plan. I mean what is the secret behind something you tell everyone? \nIt just bothers me when villain out of no reason start telling you their whole plan, or what evil stuff they already did, especially when they don’t need to. Why would they do that? And when they tell you everything about their plan why do they stop there? Why not telling the audience WHY they did that, WHAT motivations they had? Maybe going a little bit into the depth of characters? \nBut let’s go to the analysis: \nThe story had a more immature writing style. It’s not only the already mentioned dragging you in only one direction and don’t allow any open mind believe that make this anime immature there are more than just that point. The representation for example was very childish. You can’t take a show seriously that constantly includes comedy parts, with a funny artstyle, which doesn’t even spare villains. From the story part, compared to the original there isn’t any uniqueness anymore. The anime really tries to be in the shonen “genre” since it lacks of consequences, motivations and logic in many cases. Even though this anime explains everything there are still many open question to it, which are very important once, maybe even plotholes or contradictions and not some simple questions like in the original, which are a matter of your own creativity.  \nThe pacing for the show changes a bit. First it starts of very fast, as if it wants to go through the story that the original had as fast as possible, and then it comes to a normal pacing. Besides the fast start the pacing was quite enjoyable. The start was a pretty important and emotional part in the original. But Brotherhoods because of the rushed pacing doesn’t manage to create the same effect as the original at the start. \nLike I said before the anime main focus is the aspect of equal trade. It was everywhere in the original.  So many little details were made, from the beginning to the ending to bring this realistic idea which was presented in a fictive style closer to its viewers. The “Brotherhoods”-series lacks so much at this point. At the start you can see it, but the more the story progresses the more it goes lost until it’s completely forgotten in the end. It is unbelievable that the writer of the manga doesn’t even get the point of his own manga, why else would he make such a consequence free story.\nThe anime is also very popular because of its action scenes. But they are way too less creative. Think about it, in this world they could make every material out of everything (at least they make steal out of stone, so silicon into iron + carbon(you also have to consider the high temperatures that have to be created), which is already hell of a transformation) It is idiotic to fight just with your “sword” when you have such an ability. You could create a vacuum or make the bottom liquid and then trap them. There are sure even far more greater ideas than that. \nBut Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood not only wants to be shonen it also tries as hard as it can to be accepted for mature audience as well. The unfitting and forced inclusion of dark gore themes and making some appearances especially bloody, but sadly they didn’t manage to do that in terms of characters and basic of story. It’s a childish story wrapped up with mature themes, explained to the audience as if they were kids. \nA very big shonen inclusion and a very annoying story-part is the “love” story they written into it. In the original the fact that the blond mechanic chick is so unimportant to Ed is a very nice thing. It’s a story about 2 brothers going on a journey not a typical love story. Therefore the inclusion of such a thing only makes it feel like the storywriters tried as hard as they could to make it appealing to as many viewers as they can. To make the “shonen” perfect we need a consequence free cliché deus ex machine ending.\n\nThe characters are written more to appeal to a younger audience as well. You can clearly see that. Ed and Alfonse act only a little bit differently than in the original but its significant change made there. In the original they had childish attitude and believes, but unlike in shonen anime the show doesn’t give them the opportunity to change the world. The thing that bothers me about shonen anime is the fact that the storywriters take a childish main protagonist who thinks that he alone could change the world and the storywriters give him the ability to do that. The drama in such shonen anime is reduced to pathetic written melodrama and the invention of motivations hasn’t been done in any kind of way. \nBut let’s go back to the protagonist and his brother. The thing is, in the original they followed a goal which they wanted to accomplish with everything they did. In brotherhood they rather help everyone out, what makes them common “hero-typed, being nice to everyone, expect for the bad guys”- characters. \nAll the other characters in Brotherhood are either annoying or unfocused or bad written. You have for example arrogant, very little knowing characters as the “good” guys, whom the storywriters use to explain the plot to the audience and we got emotionless, unmotivated and idiotic enemies who have not the slightest abilities to come up with a working plan and therefore aren’t able to create any threat to the audience.\nJust look at Van Hohenheim. In the original a serious guy with a goal, for which he even could make sacrifices to achieve it. And a carrying father for his children. A person who knows his limits.\nAnd in Brotherhood: A typical whiny guy, who cant see anyone dying and who wants to save everyone, without goal and with a past that is completely idiotic.\nI also have to mention the homunculi, which are a very important group of characters. Who doesn’t know the original: The homunculi are the anti-heroes or the enemies if you like. The original gave them background story and motivations. Normally I don’t think it is important for an action based anime to go into the depth of characters especially villains, but besides the fact that Fullmetal Alchemist has a lot of character conversations it’s also every time a nice thing to do. In this case it feels also very special, since the homunculi represent the 7 deadly sins. Everyone acts like the deadly sin he represented which makes everything quite accurate and detailed.\nThe homunculi are now in brotherhoods not only rather unimportant but completely forgotten in terms of personifications, depth, motivations and everything else that made them likeable in the original. They have no background story or any kind of focus.\nThe homunculi don’t act like the deadly sin they represented anymore. Envy acts arrogant all the time only saying he is envy, but there is no explanation why. Greed also has to tell the audience that he is greedy else you wouldn’t know. The characters have to tell you what they are, they can’t SHOW you.  The whole story has to be told to you to explain it and can’t be shown to you. And Wrath said something like: I’m proud of being a homunculus. Sloth is the worst of all because he is working overtime. \nArtstlye and soundtrack of \"Brotherhood\" where very good.The animations looked clean and the backgrounds and characterdesign was very well and detailed drawn. \nSoundtrack was better in the original but \"Brotherhood\" had a lot of nice tracks as well. \nIn conclusion Fullmetal Brotherhood was an enjoyable anime and maybe it would have been even a “decent” one, if there wasn’t already an anime that is the same thing, only superior in every important aspect. Brotherhood only shines in the shonen aspect with illogical inclusion, annoying overused characters, lack of motivation or any kind of uniqueness and plotholes unable to count. "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=33,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Fascinating. When Bones announced Brotherhood, I was like ‘You want to sell us the same story again, huh? That’s really greedy, you bastards!’ Well, I still think that Bones did it for money. Of course they did, because that is how industry works. But after spending about half a year of my life on watching Brotherhood, I have to admit that this show is worth every single yen it will earn.\nBrotherhood is a ridiculous phenomenon to me. It subverted all my criteria for choosing anime to watch. I always preferred ranobe-based shows to manga-based, and I never liked long-runners. Y’see, my ideal was some 13-episode\n          \n        bittersweet anime based on a sci-fi novel with some cute girls or something. That doesn’t resemble Brotherhood at all, right? But I cannot find a single clue to not liking the new Fullmetal Alchemist series.\nBrotherhood’s plot is nearly flawless. (I still have some questions, but I always have them, so screw me.) The first anime was good, but it played out somewhere in the middle, when its plot overran the manga. There is no such problem in the second anime. Even more, its plot goes epic near the end. Well, the word ‘epic’ is not even enough here. If English had a single word for ‘oh god, so epically epic’, that would be a better choice. And plus the skilful character development… Elric brothers actually grew up throughout the series. And there are a lot more characters with their own individualities, y’know. Arakawa Hiromu-shi is damn genius in this field, no kidding. Call me a sexist, but I never thought that female mangaka can create a plot so twisted, exciting and based on pure logic. Like, remember that episode when… Oh, I can’t bring examples without spoiling something. Bad, but let’s better proceed to next aspect.\nOnly objective issue I can bring here is that the beginning was a bit fast, but that’s okay since Bones already covered that part of the story in the first show. However, if you didn’t watch that, you’ll find that first episodes of Brotherhood are somewhat rushed.\nAnother amazing thing here is that Bones managed to keep animation quality on a high level for the whole duration of Brotherhood. They really approached this show with all responsibility. That’s praiseworthy, right?\nAnd the last aspect is music. The first anime was notable for its catchy opening and ending themes, and Brotherhood continued its tradition. Alchemist has one of the best soundtracks in anime, I think.\nOh god, I already ran out of themes to discuss. Without anything to criticize, I always have a vocabulary shortage. So, the summary: Brotherhood is a great anime. It easily overwhelms the first one in terms of enjoyment. Hell, it may be the best shōnen show about the guys with superpowers that was ever made. Some people can dislike Brotherhood for its popularity or annoying fans, but every good series receive this kind of treatment. Y’know, fandom is fandom and anime is anime. It’s a bad thing to mix those up.\nWell, giving Brotherhood 10 points will make me sound like a fanboy, but jeez, I already sound like one and I’m okay with that. I can recommend it as an example of awesome shōnen series to all anime fans, from narutards to those carriers of eternal wisdom, who think that every show which has more than 100 fans is a hyped-up kuso for brainless masses. 10 points, that’s it.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=32,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Before I get started, I should say that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is my favorite anime series and favorite television show in general. I prefer it over the first anime, but I did watch Brotherhood first which may bias that, though the ending of Brotherhood is definitely better and I really enjoy many of the characters that the first anime excluded.\nThe story of Brotherhood is one of the best ever created, following the storylineof he manga (Fullmetal Alchemist). It is the longest showI have ever watched which has practically no filler at all with just about every event in the story contributing to the overall plot\n          \n        in some way, even if you don't know it will at first. The story follows the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse, on their journey to find a philosopher's stone so that they can get back Al's body and Ed's arm and leg which they lost several year ago when they tried to bring their deceased moher back to life with alchemy but failed. Ed becomes a state alchemist with title Fullmetal Alchemist which he uses to help his research as he and Alphonse travel around the country searching for leads. Along the way, they meet Homunculi (seeingly immortal beings named after the 7 deadly sins who are te main antagonists of the series), Scar (a man who seeks revenge on state alchemists for starting a war against his people and killing them), and friends like Ling (a prince from another country seeking imortality), and other state alchemists and officials who help him like Roy Mustang and Maes Hughes.\nThe art in FMAB is exceptional and just as good in the beginning as it is in he end. The fight scenes are well designed and show an amazing amount of detail. The one thing to note is that this show has a large amount of blood (especially in the fights with the homunculi who can survive even if their bodies are cut in half many times). The sound goes along very well with tracks that fit the mood perfectly (my personal favorie being \"Pride's Theme,\" a very creepy song that fits Pride [a homunculus] very well).\nThe characters in FMAB are some of the best. Edward Elric is my favorite anime character. Ed is a short, blonde boy who los his right arm and left leg which are now replaced with automail. He is the youngest state alchemist ever due to his abilit to transmute (the act of doing alchemy) without a transmuation circle (which he gained at the same timehe lost his arm an leg). Alphonse is Ed's younger brother whose soul resides in a large suit of armor which was the result of Ed's last-ditch effort to save his brother after failing t bring their mother back to life. Al is often mistaken for the Fullmetal Alchemist due to this which annoys Ed (plus Al's now taller than his shorter, older, brother). Winry Rockbell is Ed and Al's childhood friend and Ed's automail mechanic who created his leg and arm.\nSome of my other favorite characters are Envy (one of the homunculi who can shapeshift and disguise himself [his gender is never actually determined] which basially makes him the troll of this show), Roy Mustang (the Flame Alchemist who wants to become the military leader of the country in place of King Bradley one day and works with Ed and Al at times though Ed doesn't really like him much at first), Riz Hawkeye (the kin of woman who obliterates any stereoptypes about women, she is Mustang's most trustworthy soldier and helps protect him her badass-ness), Ling Yao (the prince from another country who seeks immortality, though saying much abou him would be a spoiler; accompanying Ling are Lan Fan and Fu who are his personal bodyguards and will lay their lives down to protect him [Lan Fan follows in Riza's badass, stereotype-destroying footsteps]), and Maes Hughes (a militaryman who loves his family, his friends, his family, being cheerful, and of course his faily [want to see a picture of his daughter?]).\nI enjoyed every second of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The ending is one of the best ever, the characters are some of the best ever, the story has many plot twists but none that seem forced and the lack of filler keeps the story moving at all times making you want more and bringing you back for each episode. I really can't any fault with show.\nI highly recommend this show for every anime fan. It is my personal favorite show frm any medium (anime or not).\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=30,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    This anime is about two brothers fighting to regain their bodies after a alchemy experiment gone wrong. Along the way they uncover an evil plot and pick up many companions. \nPlot: Think of a very linear anime like Fist of the North Star, where Kenshiro travels from village to village, challenge to challenge, always moving forward, always exploding heads and never revisiting any of the places he’s conquered. FMA is the opposite. It actually reminded me of an RPG videogame the way the characters would travel back and forth between cities and how these locations would change between visits. For example, Edward goes from the\n          \n        Central city to the East, back to central to deal with new shit, visits Winry in his village, goes to central again to deal with new shit before heading to another city in the far East to deal with even more shit etc… I love this because it makes understanding the geography of Amestris important and allows the viewer to explore the country with Ed/Al.\nPacing: The series starts out doing a great job showing how characters get from point A to point B but then they get lazy. About halfway through the series characters start jumping between cities without proper explanation of how they got there. For some people it’s irrelevant but to me, it gives the impression that the characters simply teleported. I mean how does a little girl magically get from the frozen tundra of the north of the country’s eastern desert in between episodes? I’d like to know. Now do I want them to devote ½ of the series’ screen time to train rides? No. But it could have used smoother transitions.\nAlso, By season 3 the cast gets large enough to where the episodes switch between 4-5 different character groups in different parts of the country. In theory this is good because it adds intricacy to the plot. The problem I have with FMA is that they will leave one storyline on a cliffhanger to switch to a relatively uneventful storyline. For example, they’ll leave Edward bleeding and half dead in a frozen wasteland just to switch to Al and Winry helping villagers build houses. It’s one thing if you follow Game of Throne’s style of switching from cliffhanger to cliffhanger but in this case I thought they could have cut out some of the fluff to make the story arc pacing a little smoother.\nAction: I always like it when anime introduces a new fighting style. FMA does this with the addition of alchemy. The fight scenes are cool, creative and diverse. I also liked how even though Ed was a badass his friends didn't become useless or obsolete (aka like Goku's friends).\nComedy: This deserves its own section. Basically it’s pretty simple, if you like anime-style, slapstick, comedic moments you’re going to jizz yourself every almost episode if you don’t, you won’t stop rolling your eyes. There’s probably a Japanese term for it but it’s the comedy that involves fainting/nose bleeds after embarrassing moments, extreme facial distortions when angry, sleeping snot bubbles, huge skull blisters appearing after a friendly wrench beating. I found it a little much to be honest and it gave the anime a much lighter tone. Some people will love it though.\nSound: I really liked the English dubs. Great voice acting cast. I didn’t care for the intros/outros, but the music sound track was solid.\nArt: Good \nCharacters: Great memorable characters with very vibrant personalities. I thought the concept of the homunculi was brilliant and their personalities, despite embodying single sins, were very complex and interesting—especially Greed, Wrath and Envy. Oh and Scar is one of the most badass antiheroes in anime. My only complaint is that they spent a LOT of time developing smaller side characters and not a lot of time killing them off. I mean yeah it’s good to develop support characters but by the end of the series the cast felt a little clunky. I mentioned this earlier but even in a 64 episode series you only have so much screen time. Instead of devoting time to exploring the thoughts, struggles and emotions of minor henchmen and tagalongs, why not spend it on the mains who are so much more interesting? Using the law of equivalent exchange, I would have liked FMA to transmute some side characters into more screen time for underdeveloped plots like Winry-Ed, backstories of Homunculi, Scar’s story, Father, etc. \nOverall: I am 90% satisfied. I think I would have been at 100% if this series could have been a little shorter or a lot longer. Basically if they had trimmed it down or spent the extra time to make everything complete. Everyone always raves about the ending but to be honest I still wanted more.\nBlood/Gore: It’s surprisingly bloody for a MA14+ anime. Severed limbs, bullet wounds, human sacrifice…mixed in with slapstick comedy.\nLove/Romance: Yes, there is a romantic subplot that develops very, very slowly over the series but it’s not the main focus. The “Action/Romance” genre is often attempted but seldom done well. It usually turns out to be an action anime w/ a clumsy love-interest side-plot or a sappy romance story with 2nd rate action. Either way the non-dominant side just becomes a plot device for the other one. Personally, I’m not really into sappy romance animes but I like it when a romantic subplot is done right and can make me care about a couple’s mutual survival in the context of a larger struggle (Mirai Nikki, Gosick). Anyway FMA does that well but I thought it could have been done better. \nSex/Nudity: Laura Bailey’s voice is pure sex. \nLook out for:\nEpisode 42, 15:00 “Now that he’s taken a monster like you into his flesh”\nEpisode 54, 10:50 an unfathomably homoerotic scene."},

The story was always keeping the 'watcher' wanting to keep watching no matter what.( I found myself staying up way later than I planned to keep watching this series) Every concept in this anime (Alchemy and Alkahestry) was simply fantastic learning about and watching it be used from creating giant flipping fists punching people in battle to saving peoples lives. Anyone who has watched this anime(or read the manga) probably agrees with me that they would give anything for our world to have Alchemy. And also,THERE ARE NO FILLERS, *laughs like\n          \n        a madman*\nThe Art in FMA Brotherhood was simply fantastic. Watching the magnificent view of the Resembool country side to every small detail of the tediously created alchemy circles to every fight scene; the breathtaking and epic animations were clearly shown in every episode. All the fights had more... oomph, than those in FMA. There was more fight and felt like you were actually there. They were more dramatic and more gruesome(gruesome being a good thing)\nThe sound in FMA Brotherhood was fantastic as well. All the ending and beginning songs were spectacular.(as well as their animations) Much effort was put into every sound. The sound of a transmutation circle going off, the clapping of hands for Ed's alchemy, agonizing screams of people who loose limbs or are mortally wounded, well thought out speech for every character; they were all fantastic.\nThe Characters were spectacular as well as everything else. Every Character was fabulous and played an important role for the overall story. The only problem I had involving characters was that the main antagonist's personality was boring. He didn't seem interesting enough. Another minor problem with one of the characters, I would have given anything for Sloth to say, \"What a drag.\" instead of, \"What a pain\" (if anyone got that reference)(hm, that may be considered copyright, I don't know)\nEnjoyment, damn right I enjoyed this anime. Without hesitation, I put it as my top and most favorite anime. Two other things I would like to point out that I also enjoyed about this anime. The great amount of suspension and action leading up to the Promise Day and how burly men.(in Brotherhood it's Major Armstrong and Sig Curtis, forgot who it is in FMA) There was I was literally crying from how funny it was, how they compete against each other with muscles and gain each others respect. Then see them handshake. One of my most favorite things about this anime. \nThe first time I watched through FMA and FMA Brotherhood, I hated everything about Brotherhood but loved FMA. I don't know why. Rewatching both of them, I've found that I love Brotherhood a 100, no, a thousand times better than FMA. I hated the FMA ending but loved everything about Brotherhood. I don't know what I was thinking.\nOverall, I would recommend this to anyone, it's long enough where it's not as short as those 12 or 24 episode anime and then ends abruptly. FMA brotherhood has a pretty damn good ending(better than most), well I mean sure it could have gone on for another episode or two to explain some things *cough* *cough* Winry and that stuff. Anyways, if you watched FMA and wondering if you should watch Brotherhood, WATCH IT. If you've already watched both of them, I hope you agree with me that Brotherhood is superior, watch it again because it never gets old. \n        "},

However, Brotherhood is the completely opposite. Since the storyline completely rushed, it does not allow for explanation. The characters are introduced so quickly, making Brotherhood just like any other anime out there.\nI was really looking forward to watching this new version (despite wishing for a continuation of the original series) since it followed the manga more accurately.\nBrotherhood is a disappointment for me, but I will continue to watch it since I love the original FMA so much.\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=29,   ["text"]="                          \n    Let me start off by saying that this is my first review so go easy o.O\nI saw the first FullMetall Alchemist series and loved it. I was hooked from episode one when they aired it on Cartoon Network. Being the somewhat impatient person I am, I went online searching for the next episode one night after the tenth or eleventh episode had finished. I found what I was looking for and found that there were 52 episodes waiting to be downloaded! Yes, you can assume this anime is what made me discover fan subbing -_^. Anyway, the anime was great, I couldn't get enough when\n          \n        the series ended on that metal fist grabbing at the sun. Not too much later I discovered that a movie was coming out and it was the completion of the anime series that had finished. Needless to say, I was excited, I enjoyed the FINAL conclusion of the story. Now that I've said all this, I wanted to say that I always felt like there were \"holes\" in the story. Like, information that was there but not being told. Well...\nNot too long ago, I got bored one day, so I looked for some manga to read (FYI Manga/Anime isn't a huge hobby just a coincidence =P) and found the FMA manga. I decided to read it, to see if there was a huge difference between the manga and the anime. I cheated a little bit and started off a bit into the story and discovered that lots of stuff was there that was not in the anime. So, I had to treck back to a point where this information started. I finished the manga in a couple days and WOOOW. Not only was I correct about there being some information missing in the anime, but there was so so so so so much more that was supposed to happen.\nSo, it's my assumption that this new series is going to follow in the true story of the FMA and the two brother's journey in their alchemy filled fantasy world. So far the story that is being told in the \"Brotherhood\" series is sticking pretty true to the manga. If this is true, please, take my advice, stay tuned. Especially if you were a good fan of the first series or just love a good anime with great plot twists and a great story line. whatever your interest, if my assumption is correct, which I'm 99.9% sure it is, you're all in for a real treat! =)\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=29,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Let me get one thing out of the way before I start this review: “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood” blows its predecessor out of the water! Mind you, this is coming from a guy who found the original Fullmetal Alchemist a rather disappointing experience. That essentially means that I was skeptical when I first started watching this anime, only to be totally shocked by how good it was!\nWhether you enjoyed the original, or hated it, this reincarnation of Fullmetal Alchemist has completely changed my opinion of the series as a whole!\nBreakdown:\nStory (10/10) – I cannot stress enough how much better the story of “Brotherhood” is than the\n          \n        original. If you’re reading this review, you likely know that the original show deviated from the manga after a short while, and continued in a rather different direction. As manga tends so often to be, the story of the manga ends up being much stronger than what the creators of the original anime were able to come up with. “Brotherhood” follows the story of the manga quite closely, thus the anime never feels like filler, or just boring junk.\nThe first fifteen episodes or so are very similar to about the first half of the original “Fullmetal Alchemist”. “Brotherhood” covers more story in less time, and doesn’t drag nearly like the original did. This is especially apparent in the beginning, where some parts that were already told in the original series were more or less skipped over to save time. Purists might squawk about this, but it was probably a wise idea, in light of time constraints.\nIf you’ve seen the original Fullmetal Alchemist, then you’ll be familiar with the first major portions of the show. It may feel like a rehash for the first several episodes, but you’ll fairly quickly realize that the scale of what will eventually take place is much greater, and much more sinister than what the original Fullmetal Alchemist conveyed. The twists that Ed and Al are taken through are enough to leave you wanting more after each episode. \nBut enough rambling. If you’d like a synopsis, just look one up.\n(Art 10/10) – The art in this show is simply superb! Characters and scenery are drawn with careful detail, and they also achieve a sense of realism, which is somewhat necessary in a “Steam-Punk” world that could almost be America a century ago. The mix of realism, combined with the fantasy of Alchemy, creates for an interesting balance that not many animes can achieve. Additionally, the art is very smooth, with each movement flowing into the next seamlessly. There were a few instances where larger or more intricate drawings were done with computer animation. These scenes are slightly choppier than the rest of the anime, but you likely won’t notice unless you’re looking for it.\nThe only gripe I had with the animation was early on in the show, where characters would burst into silly caricatures  when they were especially emotional about something. Most notably is Ed transforming to look like a praying mantis when someone calls him short. This made it seem like the show didn’t take itself very seriously at first, but such incidents gradually declined as the show progressed, and became rather scarce during the more serious parts of the show. I simply think the show would have benefitted from less outbursts of this nature early on. \n(Sound 9/10) – The voice acting in this show is some of the best you’ll hear. I was pleasantly relieved to hear that there were no annoying, shrill voices that anime can be guilty of at times. There weren’t any standout performances that I can think of, but each actor voiced their role marvelously.\nThe only reason for a 9 instead of a 10 was that it sounded to me like some of the music had been recycled from the original Fullmetal Alchemist. The music fit the scenes very well, but I thought an update might have been helpful. Also, the music never really stuck out to me as being particularly awesome. It was good, but not quite deserving of a 10.\n(Characters 10/10) – It will be quite a struggle to keep my comments succinct on this topic! “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood” shines brilliantly in this area! Never before have I grown so attached to such a diverse cast of characters. There were a number of characters that I wasn’t particularly attached to in the original series that I grew to love in “Brotherhood”.  The show does a brilliant job of making each character’s motivations easy to understand, yet complex enough that they aren’t totally flat.  It also has a way of forcing characters who were once enemies to work together when faced with a common enemy. \nI was especially impressed by how Ed and Al were so much easier to relate to in “Brotherhood”. I found myself much more emotionally attached to them, and had a much stronger desire to see them succeed. Al is much stronger and helps Ed fight much more often, which I also found to be a pleasant change of pace. I could name probably ten other characters who I grew attached to, yet wasn’t terribly fond of in the original series. “Brotherhood” also introduces a set of new characters that blend in perfectly with that cast that I was already familiar with. \nThe long and short of it is this: the cast of “Brotherhood” will draw you in and leave you eagerly watching their every move until the conclusion of the series.\n(Enjoyment 10/10) – I really don’t have much to say on this topic, except I loved it! I never had to force myself to keep going, and I enjoyed every bit of the show!\n(Overall 10/10) – Definitely give this one a shot! It’s well worth your time. And in my opinion, it’s far superior to its  predecessor."},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=25,   ["text"]="                          \n    I've watched this series because it was recommended by this website. In no way does this show belong at the top. While the animation was solid, and the story was fairly good, it failed in many other aspects. They could have easily cut 30 episodes out to make it better. Some of the fights are completely redundant and the outcome makes absolutely no impact on the story. What I mean is, there is little point to the fighting. Most of the fighting comes down to characters throwing alchemy at each other. I also have to say that the last fight is completely disappointing. Furthermore, the\n          \n        only character that has any progression whatsoever is Scar. Everyone else is as stale and weak by the end as they were in the beginning. Honestly, I've seen so much anime over the years, and I was never as disappointed with the show as I was with FMA:B. I've never seen the original, it was just one of those shows that I never got around to watching, maybe that is my issue.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=28,   ["text"]="                          \n    I prefer the first one. I'm here to say that if you don't get all the hype about Brotherhood its okay.\nThat said I think the ending of Brotherhood was all around put together 5x as well. In all the anime was pretty good and was pretty interesting, but I don't get why it averages such high ratings. I prefer the sad ending of the first one, but the story had already fallen apart by that point. Brotherhood on the other hand knew exactly where it was going and attempted to get there at 10x the speed of the first one and with 1/3rd the character\n          \n        development.\nBelievability: I would prefer Brotherhood's composition with the first one's story. I just didn't find it that believable. What can make a break a story's believability is the action scenes. Every single antagonist that they fought in Brotherhood should have won. The only fights that could conceivably end in a win were ones with Scar and the only reason I think that is because Scar is a bamf. The biggest hit to the believability of the story was everything to do with the main antagonist. Everything about him including how he lost is hard for me to believe and made it impossible for me to immerse myself in the story. If you care less about how believable the means are and care more about the results, then Brotherhood is great for you.\n*****Spoiler Section*******\n- For people who want specific examples of what i mean when i talk about the            fight scenes I have provided a few examples below:\n-Fight with  Pride: This is the fight I look back to when I try to recall an example. It is simply ridiculous. Why didn't Pride just stab them where they weren't blocking? There is no reason except the plot. They had to beat him therefore they did. Every time Ed blocked all of Pride's spikes with his one arm I did a facepalm. \n-Fight with Lust: She can just spear you with her \"Ultimate Spear.\"  She is unbeatable except when she needs to be beaten for the plot to progress.\n-Fight with Greed: There was actually no problem with this fight technically, but Greed supposedly had the \"Ultimate Armor\" and yet he has fairly obvious weak points all over his body? There are no huge weaknesses to the other homunculi abilities and yet his is made inferior just by that fact of him being a homunculus? When I think about him I remember how Ed beat him in the first one. His armor had no real weakness, Ed just used his brain and made the armor not armor.\n-For those who have seen the anime and wonder what I found unbelievable about Father I have provided a few things below:\nAlchemy: How did Father not know about the foreign versions of Alchemy. He was made of the stuff in the first place. That simply makes no sense.\nHis Death: Talk about cliche... Ed fit into every single male protagonist cliche when he fought Father. Somehow a guy who can do above average Alchemy can beat a being made from the stuff, who can use alchemy with a thought? What!? One might make the argument that Father was out of energy during their fight. Well... isn't that convenient. He could have squashed them at any other time, but didn't because he correctly assumed they were nowhere close to his strength. It is the classic villain loses because of his own arrogance instead of any real actions taken by the heroes. It just seemed like the story could have simply been about Father and how he tried to become God and failed because it wasn't possible and have no mention of any of the main characters except to have them kick start his ritual.\n"},

Whether you agree with my opinion is up to you, but even though it currently sits as the best ranked anime, I feel the need to explain why I love this\n          \n        series so much.\nStory (10/10)\nThe story of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one that, like many journey stories, sounds simple. Two brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric are searching for a Philosopher's Stone in an attempt to take their bodies back following a failed experiment to revive their mother. \nThis simple setup is all the story really needs to engage you, and from there, you watch as the show will continually introduce more characters, more world building, heavier plot elements, without ever deviating from that simple setup. \nAs the show goes on it becomes more and more apparent in what everything is leading up to, and you're able to appreciate the show even more for themes of obsession, moving on, wondering if revenge is really worth it, human potential for creation or destruction, how science can benefit or harm the world and ultimately, working around the theme of Equivalent Exchange. \nI would go into more but to avoid spoilers, let's just say these themes are expertly woven into the narrative so that it still keeps its core focus. They don't make aspects up on the spot, it feels like the story was planned to be this way from the start\nThe main power system, Alchemy, is very well explained in how intricate it is, how there are different types, different methods to it, what it means for different people and how it affects what happens in front of the Elric brothers.\nThe show does a great job of building suspense, although this element is not as strong as in the 2003 series. Still, the villains are intimidating to really make their presence known, and what they have in store for our heroes never failed to surprise me. You'll see plenty of twists and turns, but the show doesn't solely rely on that.\nThere is also comedy thrown into the mix, which occasionally distracts from the overall tone, but is often put in, basically rest spots separated from drama. These jokes tend to hit bull-eyes most of the time, can be creative while also tying well to the established personality of its cast, and since you aren't always expecting a joke, it makes it more surprising when you're slammed with a punchline.\nThe show follows the full story of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga, in which the narrative had a lot more of a Shonen feel to it. This isn't a bad thing at all, as while the original was a more suspense-filled psychological show, this one is a Shonen in style and appropriately epic action, but you'll never feel like the narrative doesn't know how to get smart. The show dabbles in its mythos enough for viewers to sink their teeth into, but not so much to lose the audience in technical terms. It's an expertly crafted story.\nArt (9.5/10)\nOne aspect that definitely improved over the last series was the artwork and animation. The original series already had fantastic artwork for 2003, with the style trying to replicate the manga in basics but still looking appealing. Every character didn't feel like the same design, even background ones looked different in some way. The action scenes were usually more limited to reflect the more psychological tone but were still pretty good. Studio BONES took Brotherhood's animation to a whole other level.  The Action scenes are consistently fantastic, with loads of detail put into every power, whether it be earth alchemy, lightning alchemy, Bradley's sword fighting, the untapped power of a transmutation circle,  or my personal favorite, Roy Mustang's Flame Alchemy. All of these powers flow beautifully into the action, and with the edition of Xing and Briggs to the narrative, there are even more standout designs to incorporate.\nSound (9/10)\nThere was not a single opening or ending I disliked in this show. All of them perfectly replicated what was happening in the show at the time, and the background music is also solid. Not QUITE as good as 03 for some of the background OST, but the tracks very much pull their weight. The dub, seen by many as one of anime's best, is actually an overall improvement. Despite a few recastings, most of the original series cast returned for the reboot, and with the added energy and intensity offered from the source material, they get to showcase their talents better than ever before.\nCharacter (10/10)\nThe best aspect of both Fullmetal Alchemist series was easily the characters. Despite their simple journey setup, both are incredibly character driven shows, introducing many characters and giving almost all of them an arc or relevance in the story at some point. Although some characters like Nina, Hughes, Lust and Izumi get less time here compared to the original 2003 series, most of the others either maintain their excellent characters such as the engaging and incredibly well resolved Elric brothers themselves, the dutiful/sisterly but with a tinge of vulnerability Riza Hawkeye, the incredibly buffed and pompous Alex Armstrong, the rough and energetic Winry Rockbell, and my obvious favorite Colonel Roy Mustang, for being both super awesome, and super professional, doing a lot of important maneuvering and achieving an excellent catharsis, yet still going higher. \nWhile it is true certain characters like Izumi, Lust and Hughes have less screentime to develop them than previously, many other characters get even better characterizations than before such as Scar, Kimblee, Greed, Bradley, Dr. Marcoh, and especially Hohenheim, who not only gets a full character arc in this series, but also ties directly into the scheme of the main villain, as opposed to being a non-character shown very briefly at the end of the previous series with little impact. The introduction of the country Xing and Fort Briggs adds even more characters to the mix. Ling Yao, despite not being the most lovable at first, became my eventual favorite among them for having a very fulfilling development arc. The villains too, despite being less personal than previously, still have interesting characterizations, intentions, and elaborate roles to play in this puzzle piece set up.\nAlmost every character has an important role to play, with proper setup on who they are, why they are, and how they are. So many get their own arcs in the narrative that it adds a lot to the overall impact. Unlike the previous series, where a lot of the side arcs felt too periphery from the intended personal conflict, here, they add to a cohesive whole, which I think is the stronger approach. Overall, a fantastically quirky and memorable cast with captivating character depth.\nEnjyoyment (10/10)\nThis series did not have a dull moment. It continuously kept me engaged with a fantastic and brilliant story that never fails to disappoint, incredible animation, and many three dimensional characters. I highly recommend giving this series a watch, maybe even buying it as well. If for some reason you cannot watch 03, watch this one first but if you can, watch it second. Despite a rushed beginning, its more consistent style, scope, epicness and catharsis will hopefully satisfy.\n        "},

An unpredictable Story full of plot-twists that link everything in the grand finale, leaving you a huge satisfaction!\nCharacters: 10/10 \n(The strongest point of the series) \n The whole FMA characters are really strong, full of emotions beings, here we talk about MC that their actions are based on the situation, sometimes they are sad, sometimes they are angry, sometimes they are really motivated, in other word Complex like human beings. \nMost important they are not almighty, not even the bad guys, they have the powerfull side and their weak side, the character development is exquisite in this series. I really like that female characters are so strong and independent, clever and fast thinking, so good at fighting (Riza is so badass), in other words, as interesting as the male ones. \nArt: 10/10\nThe animation is timeless, I re-watched FMA this year (2015) and found it better that a lot of animes of this year or last year, the fight sequences are fluid and remarkable, face expressions are one of the strong points of the anime.  Backgrounds are amazing and funny parts are cute also. \n\nSound: 10/10\nThis anime has an outstanding soundtrack that make every episode better than it is, sad music, cool music and epic OP/ED that are impossible to forget. \nEnjoyment: 10/10\nWithout using cliffhangers, you will experience with this anime the need to watch next episode and the next one, and even is 64 episodes long, at the end will seem short. \nThe re watch value in FMA Brotherhood is super high, you will find it as refreshing and interesting as the first time, but I recommend to al at least wait a whole year. \nOverall: 10/10\nI recommend this anime to people who want to experience a deep emotional journey with characters that grow over time and unpredictable story that leave you a lesson at the end, I mean to everyone, no one should miss FMA ;) \nCons: you will find hard to find another anime that fill the void that FMA left hahaha … really, I have heard of so many people, as well as me, that rise their standards of anime after watching FMA Brotherhood. \nEnglish is not my native language so please ignore grammatical errors :3 "},

Now for my Take on the so called \"greatest anime of all time\". IMO its pretty damn mediocre. I had watched the original, and thought it ok. Now i had to watch this. Due to my personal dislike of filler i thought id like FMABH. Yet i was sorely disappointed. I tried to go in open minded hoping to enjoy. Yet, found myself bored, I mean very bored. Like watching Bakemonogatari bored. Nothing to me stands out in this show. One it\n          \n        has my least favorite character of all time in it(ok possible there are othr worse characters). Yet people treat Elric as if he was the greatest character. Hes a very very bad character for the number of episodes(more anger from everyone). Let me ask you, why is he fighting? Hes, fighting  to get him and his brother's body back. Its not as if their was some injustice, someone who stole their body. Oh no it was their own foolishness and i didn't feel sorry. Hell i didn't feel sorry during the entire series, Huges dies? who gives a !@#$. it wasn't sad. he went down swinging and he had a family, but rly? Its not like Clannad, (i hate harems but this is sad) and possibly even grave of the fireflies. Those are  sad. Now what ill say it does right sometimes is animation. even though at first i loved the alchemy mechanics,(so cool) it got very repetitive. The fights were smooth, but them, like most of the series became repetitive and i fast forwarded through to get to some plot. Let me now say though some things are great the first op was so good and it got my hopes up. the art was beautiful, and some characters were actually good. such as Hoenhiem or Rath.  Sound such as swords were amazing a true shinning point. Yet in the end what rly killed me was the predictable ending. I was expecting an epic final fight or epic final plot tiwst true Stiens;Gate or Madoka style, yet it was just final bad guy standing there, and guys saying \"FIRE EVERYTHING\". Then bad guy just takes it like a bauws. I did like that he was in it for Knowledge, at least he had a viable reason unlike elric who just lost and arm and a leg,but with automail why even give a !@#$? FMABH to me this is the greatest overrated anime of our time. The people who have this a favorite should rly try to expand out a little, and if it is your fav. well im sorry my opinion greatly differs.

The show presents two brothers embarking a journey with a simple goal of recovering their limbs/body. In the world of Fullmetal Alchemist, a practice called alchemy is used to obtain something in exchange for something of equal value. Alchemy is very versatile in this sense as it used healing, fixing and even fighting. \nFullmetal alchemist presents a very interesting and enjoyable unique story with each episode building up on one another. It is well paced and consistent with its overall goal. No episodes felt irrelevant to the plot which made every episode\n          \n        worth watching. Its build up with each episode created a very satisfying ending with great twists and turns. It was unpredictable at times and had great action with the use of alchemy.\nThe characters in Fullmetal Alchemist are very likeable with each character having an ulterior motive. The interactions with the cast provided great entertainment and depth. Character development of the cast was top notch with lots of memorable moments. There are many antagonists in the show with each being labelled as one of the deadly sins. Each one managed to live up to their name having different personalities and motives. \nOverall, I was completely satisfied after watching Fullmetal alchemist Brotherhood.

After I had finished watching the original FMA, I felt a endless sense of dissatisfaction, as the ending didn't sit right with me at all. \nI'll be honest, i put off watching Brotherhood for a very long time, as i didn't think that a lot of the series would have changed dramatically. I expected a bit of enhanced animation and the addition of a few characters. God. I couldn't be more wrong. The remake shines a new light onto the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise, improving all of the imperfections and errors that were in\n          \n        the original series.\nThe story line was healthy and straight to the point right from episode 1. No mucking about. As the plot goes on it gets hard to compare both series as the plot slowly drifts in difference directions from each other. What i was most enjoyed about was of-course, the ending. It was initiated perfectly, leaving no questions un-answered, which i feel was my main issue with Fullmetal Alchemist. It tied the entire show together neatly, the way it should have been.\nThe animation was beautiful. At times it was inconsistent, but even then it was great. Given that there is roughly a 6 year gap between the FMA and brotherhood, improved animation was a defiant. A lot more detail was provided though, which was a pleasant surprise.\nAh, now for the sound. Masafumi Mima deserves a medal, because he completely nailed this. I don't think there was a single OP or ED that i didn't enjoy. It matched the concept of Fullmetal Alchemist and scenes so well. There is nothing to say other than it was amazing.\nThe characters were developed a lot which was nice to see. It seemed there were at least a few episodes per main character to try to get to know them and deconstruct them as a character. This was a smart way to build the connection between viewer and character. Also bringing in a few new main characters that were not even mentioned in the original series was risky, but boy, it pull off. It gave a whole new feel to the show. With that being said, that squinty eyed guy sure knew how to annoy me at times.\nOverall I am so glad i finally decided to watch Brotherhood. I ask for nothing else. I am more then content now hah. For everyone that has seen Fullmetal Alchemist and is thinking about watching Brotherhood but is worried it will be a waste of time because you think you already know what will happen. Go watch it, now. Stop reading this review and go watch it.\n"},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=18,   ["text"]="                          \n    This review will be rather short.\nThe story is not bad in general, it is just awfully directed. The main reason which caused that I didn't enjoy this anime was pathetic humour which is ruining EVERY episode. For example, there is a situation where main characters are talking about something interesting, and unexpectedly something \"funny\" happens and main thread of their conversation (or even whole episode) is cutted, because \"funny\" situation is most important of course. It is happening in EVERY episode, sometimes few times. Yeah, that 'humour' destroyed the whole story.\nBut this is not the only reason of course. The next thing: main characters. They\n          \n        are boring. Typical battle shounen scheme. There were a lot episodically characters which were much better and interesting than Erlic brothers and no.1 badass - Bradley King.\nI liked the whole idea of philosopher stones and homunculus thing (and their names taken from seven deadly sins)\nThe plot story is way too episodic too.\nArt - I loved that backgrounds. Seriously, it was really well drawn. Animation was nice too. But in other side, almost all characters looked very bad and too simple.\nSound - voice actors were matched really good (as usual in anime). Of course I'm talking about original Japanese voices. Soundtrack is average, I don't like this type of soundtracks (symphonic ones, like from 'Murican blockbuster). It is boring as hell, I'm glad, that it is rather not usual in anime.\nSummarizing,I felt like I was watching rather a generic USA movie (trust me, I've seen plenty of them in my life, I started watching anime, because I was bored as hell by hollywood crap) than actual anime.\nFMA:B is yet another battle shounen, which are thousands. It is not bad anime, but in my opinin it doesn't deserve to be even in top 50. It would be much better, when it would be 50% shorter and without ALL that pathetic humour.\nI watched it, and probably in next year I will totally forget about it.\n        "},

Overall its a pretty good series that stuck to its guns when trying to focus on the story while handling many characters. \nStory 10/10\nThe story of FMA can be sometimes really lighthearted and warm where you have scenes of comedy and happiness while the other half of the story some things are very dark. I watched the first few episodes of the series with a cousin who stopped watching cause he couldn't handle\n          \n        a certain dark scene that has been referenced in various FMA and anime memes (You people of the internet probably know what I am talking about). The best part about this story which is the main reason I give the story a ten out of ten review is because it feels complete where it stopped where everything finished. \nArt 9/10 & Sound 9/10\nThe Art of the series was pretty good I cant really say much about it as most of the best parts of the animation where various scenes where alchemy is used. The music also used in various scenes throughout the show make the alchemy scenes feel more epic to watch. \nCharacters 10/10\nThe Characters both major and supporting all have some role in the series that gives them a purpose to be in the series which a lot of series fail to do. You have the brothers who are pretty much the personification of brotherhood which is seen through their interactions. Some of the villains you find in the series can make your blood boil but when they are defeated you cant help but pity them. The supporting characters that have nothing to do with the Elric brothers in the first place all get some decent character development that makes you like them as the story progresses even in the last season and a half of the show.  \nEnjoyment 10/10\nI really enjoyed this series and it is good for anyone who wants to watch a full series in their spare time rather then watch something and wait a month or a year for a continuation.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Hiromu Arakawa's Fullmetal Alchemist is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time. It is larger than life yet deeply personal. It touches on loss, the meaning of life, cultural diversity, the dangers of science, Nazism, the Iraq war, and the list goes on. Arakawa seamlessly weaves so coherent a story from such divergent threads that it mirrors the skill of a first-rate novelist. She is a brilliant world-builder and her characters are exceptional.\nFor instance, Arakawa's representation of women breaks with convention. There are strong, independent women like Izumi Curtis, Riza Hawkeyes, and Olivia Armstrong. These characters are complex and unique, as one can\n          \n        notice from each character's distinct source of independence – confidence (Izumi), resolve (Hawkeyes), and leadership (Armstrong). There are tenderhearted mothers like Gracia Hughes and Trisha Elric; and those who cannot be captured by such umbrella terms like Winry Rockbell, Maria Ross, and May Chang. I suppose it's only natural for Japan's most successful female mangaka to embody such an ambitious project – to portray the totality of womanhood: thèse, antithèse, et synthèse. Furthermore, she gives plenty of time and space to include the backstory of every character. None of them has an uninteresting backstory and they all somehow play key roles in this mysterious world.\nDespite the presence of alchemy, the world of Fullmetal Alchemist is very similar to ours. It is full of racism, hatred, war, greed, love, compassion, and courage. Alchemy is used as a metaphor for power, knowledge, and science. It seems magical at first, but one soon realizes that its rules cannot be bended much like the laws of nature. Even though they have such a powerful tool, we keep encountering those who wish to go beyond its limits. Alchemy is, arguably, a reflection of our weakness. As the philosopher Julian Savulescu noted, humans are much better at solving abstract problems than learning how to work together as a whole. Edward's final decision in the show alludes to Arakawa's message that we do not need to rely on knowledge and science to lead a meaningful life. Instead, we need to accept the human condition. Similar to Aristotle's notion of the Good Life, Ed and Al choose to pursue virtues like friendship, altruism, humility, and compassion. Humanity was not meant to know everything, and the human condition bids us to focus on the Good rather than the Truth. It appears that Arakawa is a pragmatist– knowledge is useful insofar as it is practical.\nThe animé-adaptation successfully captures the strengths of its illustrious source through fast-pace, quality animation, and stellar opening and ending themes. This animé is one of my favorites, and I absolutely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good work of art.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Like I've already said in some of my other review, I'm not at my best, when I'm reviewing something, that I like... or love, for that matter! Maybe because, when you usually review something you love, you tend to overhype it, drooling all over it, like a rapid dog, and when someone, like me, tends to take that overhyping for granted, it can really, really easily backfire. To me, it's just so much more easier to say, why I hate something, rathen than why I love, but if I have to tell, why I love something, it's usually just something like \"meh... because!\" Not very\n          \n        solid argument, I know, but lets just see, how do I manage this time, shall we?!\n\nStory (10)\nThe story - in a nutshell, because there's a lot! - is about two brothers, Edward and Alphonse, who study alchemy, since their deadbeat-father left them out of nowhere, without mentioning when or never to return. Their mother dies, so logically, they try to bring her back... which would be all and good, if it wasn't such a taboo! So big of a taboo in fact, that the older brother looses his arm and a leg, and the other his entire body - symbolism, everywhere! With no other choise left but to \"stand up and go further\", they burn down their house, join in the military, and start their hunt in search of a legendary Philosophers stone, that can in any hands do pretty much anything, even beyond the laws of nature, equivalent exchange, or even the God himself! All in the same time, when the military and the mysterious group of renegades called Homunculi plot their way up in the circles, all waiting the Promised Day to arrive, and end the world as they know it! \nWhat is the secret behind the Philosopher's stone, and the Isvalan civil war? What is this Promised Day, and what it means to be called a \"sacrivice\"? Who plots against who and who stands to gain immortality? All this and more, in about 60-episodes- long rollercoaster of deceat, vengeance, and hope for a happy ending!\nWhen I first saw this anime, I've already seen the \"original\" older version, and didn't like it... as much! I thought it was clumsy, little jumpy with the story department, and the characters... well, they were there. That's all. Nothing really solid there, but I won't complain. Overall, I wasn't that hyped, to see this newer, bigger and more costly \"remake\", that's supposed to follow the original manga much more loyally... and knowing, what the remakes usually do to our beloved movies, this could've been really big hit or miss! Lucky for me... I really loved it! The story really was great, with deeper themes, following so many sidestories, characters' backstories and motivations, that I actually felt like drowning into everyhting, that I was exposed to... and this anime is only about 60 episodes long! God damn!\nWhat I was so impressed about this anime, whas that it actually was relatively deep, both for a story, and the characters, and do I even dare to say... somewhat complex at a times - it took me actually three rewaches to get a good grip of the sidestories, main plot, and motivations, understandin fully every single character, and what they're \"mind-frames\" really were! \nThat being said, the plot itself is still relatively simple, but the way it's told, is not! There are so many elements, and plotpoints, that it's almost hard to tell, where the actual story is, and when do all these little pieces get put together - like a awesome 3D-puzzle! But, when it does get put together, it's just so satisfactory, that it feels like... well, it feels! Questions about live and death, teology and humans' real place in the world, what you can wish for, and what you can actually have, without breaking the boundaries you're not granted to brake, what's the true price of desires, and is there really some things in this world, that should stay forbidden, untainted by humans greedy hands? These are just a scrach on the surface of many, many themes this anime has to offer, and I can't wait, to find out even more!\n\nArt (9)\nThe art... while still not my strongest forte in my judgement-stand-point, is still pretty impressive, and pretty to look at. The backgrounds are clear and simple, yet immaginative enough to belong into this steam-punk- ish, so-so historic version of Germany in WWII, which really was a big selling-point for me, who just absolutely loves history.\nThe characters are all simple, yet easy too tell apart. They don't all have the same faces, nor all-too-similar facial expressions, which seems to be my new pet peeve in anime in regular. \nThe fights - yes, there's fighting involved in this anime... surprise! - are very detailed and the animation compiments beautifully each characters own personalities, abilities and what are their strongest points. For example, Ed is pretty talented fighter in general, but tends to \"overheat\" if being called \"shortie\". Al is much more composed, but too gentle most of the times. The homunculi are my absolute favourite to watch, since they all have different abilites, and they all use them with precise, and with deadly talent, that's just a bliss to look at!\nThere are still easily seen some brief, yet noticeable moments of changed animation styles, expecially during fighting. The movements tend to lack the same fluidity as it normally has, and be thus overly exaggerated, but those are just a very brief moments here and there, mostly in the second half of the series, so it gets a pass from me.\n\nSound (9)\nAlthoug I did watch the original Fullmetal Alchemist in english dub, I can't really say anything for it, or against it. It was nice, and had a solid talent behind it, but... since I watched this one in japanese... I just can't but to notice the difference! \nI just loved the voices in japanese! Japanese Kimbley is great, even if I have to loose Chris Sabat as a Armstrong.\nI also loved the music, with it's oh-so melancholic choirs and violins, bringin out the emotions and the power of every scene and every character so perfectly, that I can't but to listen, and enjoy!\n\nCharacter (10)\n\nThe characters - and o'boy there are tons! - aren't just some easy stereotypes, or shallow cardboard cut-outs, with little to no personality, or no actual motivations. These are real people, with real desires, flaws and sins to bear, with deep emotions and motivations, both in good and in bad. \nAnd the best part is, that it's not just the story, that gets to know them, but also we, who get to hear their thoughts, their memories and ambitions in life, like if they're talking with us, and I just love, when characters do that! You see their backstories, you hear their thoughts, their reasonings for their actions, and their points of views about situations, siding either with them, or against them. None of them are crystal clear, or pure white, and often times, I felt like watching actual real-life people, dealing with their pasts, sins, desires and flaws, rather than some fictional characters, bound in some unexplained contraption of plotpoints and events. They took their time to talk to me, to show me sides of themselves that I didn't know of, or didn't really want to learn of... but that's human for you - we all have sides in ourselves, that are both beautiful, and ugly, because we have something, called dimensions! These characters know both their own, and each others flaws, strenghts, ambitions and sins, therefore acting like a real individuals, being either hero, or a villain! \nAnd since we're already in the subject, I may as well say a thing or two about the... romances, in this anime. Yes, there're romances in this anime, and they're actually good ones! Romance in general, has never been that one ship that holds that much water in shounen... or, in anything even slightly japanese in that matter... but when it comes to FMA:B, the romance-angle is actually pretty good... even enjoyable! And I'm not even talking about the \"sappy/sugary/over-the-top\"- romance either! I'm talking about the bonds between friends, loyalty between the master and the servants, and love between brothers, what's actually the main force of the story itself. The ever-so-subtle \"loyal-admiration\"- angle with Hawkeye and Mustang was truly memorable, same as the friendship between Musty and Huges, as well as the romance between Ed and Winry, that blooms and developes the same way as the characters grow and develope. Nothing is rushed or paisted on top to look more pretty to the eyes of the viewer. It's all very well done, in the sence that it's not so over the top -they never say that they love each other, but you can still feel and see that they do! \nAnd what about the villains then? My all time favourite thriving force of any media or story-telling, that keeps me - if done right! - at the edge of my seat, begging for more and... well, let's leave it to that, shall we! The villains in this pick are also very enjoyable and well made, although the show itself do suffers that glorious \"too many characters at the same time!\"- syndrome, so that not so many chracters get their time of the day to really shine and develope as the rest of the main cast does, but the thing is, that not all of them truly even need to develope - Gluttony or Sloth, although nice in general, not really that interesting to look at. Those who do get their time in the spotlight - Kimbley, Scar, some of the Homunculi and Father, for example - do get their own backstory, motivations and their own little arcs to fulfill, some of them even growing and developing along the way. It's truly a treat to look at, and therefore I wouldn't have said a bad word if the show itself was actually... say, ten episodes longer than it was, but oh well... never please the fans - they're the worst!\nKudos for the sublety though, since every single detail, action and mistake counts to something, developing both story and the characters, giving them even more motivation, and depth, through both stakes, and consequenses - when someone dies, they stay there... for good!\n\nEnjoyment (10)\nDespite all the things and points that impressed me, this is clearly not a anime for everybody! The story, although actually relatively simple, is really so heavily and tightly packed with themes, philosophy, subplots and multi-colored characters with each of their own motivations and stories, that it's really easy to get lost in the middle of it all, and loose interest as a whole - good memory, and good attention span are needed! \nThose, who enjoy investing themselves into a deep, rather long and character/plot-driven story, that forces you to think on your own and play that \"puzzle inside your brain\"- game, can indeed find this anime rather interesting, maybe even marvelous, but do bear in mind, that there's some boobs here and there, and some of the asses are being slapped for the fun of it, so if that puts you off, then better either steel yourself, or look away - it is the military, after all! \nIf you think, that the shows like Pokemon, DBZ or Little Snow Fairy Sugar are as deep of a storytelling and characterization as you can handle, don't even bother with this one!\n\nOverall (10)\nThis anime is for those, who can appreciate deep, heavily multi-branched stories and plots, complex and colourful characters you actually get to know, and themes that'll actually make you think on your own - and it's actually not that long either, so... that helps too! The musics are amazing, and the art isn't that bad either, so if you're interested to give it a go, go for it, and enjoy the ride!\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=18,   ["text"]="                          \n    This is a short review of Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. I have seen many of the episodes, but not all of them in order and do not consider this a proper judgement of the series.\nStory - 4: The story of Full Metal Alchemist is supposed to be about two tragic brothers going to search for the Philosopher's Stone that their father disappeared looking for. The laws of equivalent exchange are supposed to be really gruesome. Going out into the world and making discoveries is something really important to the Elric brothers. This impression was what made me love Full Metal Alchemist in the 2003 version.\n          \n        In Brotherhood, you do not get a big sense of any of this happening with the main characters because the first episodes that deal with these issues are terrible. They did this to save time, but it does not make sense considering that the beginning of an adventure is always the most important part to immersing yourself in the world.\nOddly enough, the majority of Brotherhood is based in creating its world while it somehow feels like just adding China to the equation made it a lot bigger. The oriental theme always feels disconnected from world-building and this was the same with Brotherhood even though it was detailed greatly and central to our two Asian characters. Ling was almost a decent character. It is definitely easy to like him, but his rather flat and plain character was simply hidden behind emotional storytelling cliches.\nWar seems far too encompassing in the story. It seems too mundane compared to what we should expect with alchemy. There are so few alchemy users that it is ridiculous and they do not know how to use their alchemy in new ways most of the time.\nToward the final battles of the series, everyone seems shallow and it would have been fine for most of the characters to die.\nArt - 5: The art is good mainly because it is grounded in proper details and good lighting and such. The colors are done almost true to reality, which they were going for. The characters usually do not take up as much of the screen as your average anime and I felt that it was both effective and alienating. At worst, the environments are a bunch of empty, hallway-like rooms and darkness in much of the later parts of the anime. Cannon firing is over-used to make things look exciting. Expositions and waiting scenes are very common to allow for more cheaper art.\nThere is also the stupid rectangle effect with things getting obliterated or disappearing. It is quite detailed, but also not effective to conveying anything. Another annoying effect is Edward's alchemy, which is always spraying electricity and gray pillars rising out of the ground.\nWith the openings, the art was always annoyingly cliche-looking and it did not vary between seasons. Not only were they animated in an annoying or stereotypical way, but they conceptually did not form any good themes. \nThe first ending almost worked. The drawings were done nicely, but it thematically was pretty stupid to show as a children's drawing because no kid would think to draw these things except the Megaman-esque platform jumping part. The other endings were drawn very annoyingly, much more so than the openings.\nSound - 4: People love stupid orchestral music. A lot of this music was made to stay in the background and it sounds very dull and monochromatic. I honestly thought that there might have been only 6 songs. There actually are probably six songs they reuse in every episode because I remember getting really annoyed at hearing a few songs that were supposed to be sinister, but just sounded idiotically simple. The music department was just bare bones.\nWhen it comes to the openings and endings, some of them could be considered the worst of all anime, but nobody would admit that. They all sound like Bleach or Naruto songs, but without half as many strong points. Anyway, \nAs for the sound effects, they are rather comprehensive. I would have rated the sound a 2 if the sound effects were just average, but they are definitely a step above almost any anime out there.\nCharacter - 4: The characters are not explored enough to give you a sense of attachment. It feels like the war is the entire story most of the time. However, the developed characters are amazing. The villains are pretty terrible. This new (or orignail) rendition of Scar was one of the few awful protagonists compared to the 2003 anime. There is also Alphonse, who supposed to made deeper just because he finds a love interest. And, Edward is just a hopeless character. He has the same personality almost the whole time despite any supposed developments. This is mainly because the comedy feels like the only time Al and Ed could have shown what their personalities are, but everyone knows how bad the comedy is here. They are simply mired in conflict after conflict without being able to loosen up in a genuine way.\nAll of the sins are pretty bad, even Greed and Envy who get the most development. They pretty much fight and do not represent themselves with their simple to write personality traits. All that defines them as characters is combat skills and maybe some grief over what they have been doing. The Father is without character except in his background. He is pretty much a stereotypical bad guy. The somewhat tragic past of Alphonse and Edward seems to be the only thing that is supposed to carry deep negative emotion in this show, and they blew that part of the story off.\nThe voice actors are mismatched, making characters sound too stereotypical or too gruff (the Colonel definitely sounds too gruff) or just stupid (Lang and Greed to name two). However, I am basing it on an English dub and it is hard to really judge on voice acting because the Japanese could be loads better.\nEnjoyment - 7: Despite many, many faults, it is possible to get engaged in this show and love it to some extent. Unlike other shows where you might compromise your beliefs and see bad aspects as good, you are prone to gloss over the bad aspects of this show because it is very enjoyable at times. As mentioned earlier, the storytelling can beat out the bland characters, which is very much like a movie. Despite the anime openings being weak and extremely generic, they are action-packed enough that you will be bound to enjoy them.\nHowever, there is still the terrible comedy which always falls flat (and would even without so much repetition of the same junk). There are still lengthy scenes that seem to be going over the same details again or showing seemingly the same scenes you saw in other flashbacks and expositions. \nOverall - 5: I wish it could be lower considering how annoyed I was by this show.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Excuse the long review, and keep in mind this is my first\n-----------\nA few years ago in my freshman year of college, I had a number of friends who were extremely into anime. Other than watching a little bit of Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Naruto as a kid, I had little familiarity with anime. I proceeded to watch a few Miyazaki classics, and then FMA:B as my first \"serious\" anime series with. So understand that this rave review is partially due to nostalgia from those days, and you may not think it is as good as I do for that reason. Nonetheless, I probably should've started with\n          \n        a different anime, because after watching FMA:B it is extremely difficult to find anything that compares.\nAs you can tell from the synopsis, the plot is incredibly original. But the synopsis doesn't quite tell you how deep the plot runs as it deals with some heavy and dark themes. It is all delivered with brilliant execution that has you on the edge of your seat for the entirety of the series, especially after the first fifteen episodes or so. Though the pacing is a little fast at times  (especially at first, though this is mostly because it is assumed the viewer has seen the original first or has some familiarity with the manga), there is very little to complain about.\nAs it is a remake of another series, it is difficult to write a review without comparisons. First of all, I would recommend seeing the original first; I did not and I missed a few details in my first viewing of the series (I have since rewatched a few times after watching the original). It is not absolutely necessary to watch the original and Brotherhood certainly can stand on its own, but it does help a little to be at least familiar with the original. \nBrotherhood starts out largely the same as the original series (and the manga), though paced a little faster. For various reasons, largely because of the slower pace and better character development, I prefer the beginning of the original series. After episode ten or so, Brotherhood goes off in a very different direction from the original to better follow the manga. This is where I begin to significantly prefer brotherhood as it thematically covers far more ground and develops a number of the other characters in a superior way (most notably Scar, Envy, Edward, Mustang, and Wrath). Edward, especially, is far more dynamic in Brotherhood and has a better connection to the theme of the show. While the original dealt more exclusively with the ethical implications and nature of human equality, Brotherhood deals with those themes more subtlety as well as the fallibility of human knowledge, cultural and philosophic differences between the East and West, the brutal nature of war, the ethics of retributive justice, and the role of science and religion in the formation of ethics. All of these themes are dealt with in a common thread of deep humanism, and the ending is more complete and more satisfying than the original. I could go on for days about the numerous thought provoking themes this anime delivers, but I won't and it's really impossible to do justice to the plot in this review. I give it a 10/10 for plot.\nWhen it comes to art, Brotherhood is slightly better animated than the original, mostly because of technological advances between 2003 and 2009. Though the animation isn't the best feature of this anime and is hardly the best Studio Bones has produced (that honor going to Sword of the Stranger), it is still substantially above average. What really artistically stands out about FMA:B is the directing style. Though it is action-heavy like most shounen anime, it avoids all of the pitfalls of the genre. There’s no campy battle cries, the battle scenes (if you can even call them that) are actually well directed and not action-for-the-sake of action, everything isn’t immediately explained to the viewer by the participants in the battle, and the points of interest are not the battle scenes in the first place or even the powers the characters have through alchemy--but the quiet scenes where the characters reflect on their situation. It is the only shounen (other than perhaps the original) I’ve seen that I could call cerebral and reflective. There are a number of fascinating camera shots and interesting directing decisions throughout the series. For example, the way the entire end scene of  the episode “Backs in the Distance” is directed is some of the best filmography one can ask for (you’ll know what I mean when you see it). Though there are a couple moments, especially near the beginning, where the atmosphere of the anime is a little tainted by some childish humor and over-done jokes about Ed’s height (it’s easy to forget amongst all the genocide and references to classical epistemology that this was marketed to a younger audience), it is overall very well directed.  It gets a 9/10 for art.\nWhen it comes to sound, there’s a bit of a dilemma here. It may be a controversial opinion, but this (and the original) is the absolute only case where I prefer the dub to the sub. Ed’s voice in the sub sounds like a stereotypical and--to be honest--a little annoying shounen protaganist that does not do justice to the depth of his character, and Alphonse just comes off as whiny in the sub, almost reminiscent of a uke in a bad yaoi. Other than that, the sub is decent and doesn’t really detract from the series overall; but the dub is where this anime really shines. Vic Mignogna does a brilliant job as Edward Elric, and the rest of the cast, with a few exceptions, act very well.\nThe soundtrack also bears worth mentioning. I actually paid $50 plus shipping from Japan to the US to buy this soundtrack, that is how good it is. I listen to it quite a bit and many of the tracks are beautiful and match the scenes they are put in perfectly. This is among the best OSTs for anime you will find out there, and even overshadows some of the elements I do not like  at the sub. That said, the OST probably could’ve used a bit more tracks as it gets a little repetitive towards the end. For this reason, I give it a 9/10 for sound.\nThe characters in this anime are also extremely well done. Almost all the major characters are highly dynamic with deep back stories, and even the more minor characters are highly likeable and contribute significantly to the plot, with a few exceptions. And the connections between this anime’s intricate plot and deep themes and the characters go well beyond what almost any other anime does. Most of the characters are also vehicles for symbolism. Brotherhood goes far beyond being good in the department of character symbolism, and ventures into being an exemplar of what anime can be as an artform. 10/10 for characters.\nClearly, given the way I’ve been raving about it and the fact that I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve rewatched it (I’d guess around six), it’s fair to say that I think this anime is enjoyable. And not just enjoyable in the sense of entertaining (though it certainly is) or even enjoyable in the sense that you tend to lose yourself in the story (though you certainly do), but it is enjoyable in the sense of being completely enlightening thematically, as I’ve said before. If you want to think deeply about an anime, look no further than brotherhood. I even went as far as to use brotherhood in a college paper to illustrate some philosophical implications of Richard Rorty’s rejection of Cartesianism (granted, it was for a seminar on anime). Even if you don’t really want to think about an anime intellectually, it is enjoyable just for the sake of being a good story that you can lose yourself into. Whether you want a deep thoughtful anime, an action-packed shounen that you can get excited about, or just a good story to simply enjoy for its own sake, Brotherhood delivers. I typically use it as the go to to introduce newcomers to anime, and as you can see from its place in the rankings, it is much beloved by the most experienced of anime viewers. 10/10 for enjoyment.\nAs of the writing of this review, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood sits at number two overall on the MAL list, and has historically taken the number one spot on many occasions (and probably will again in the future). If you haven't seen this before, then, you are probably approaching it with extremely high expectations. Typically when people approach a show with that high of expectations, they are disappointed. FMA:B is an exception to this. It competes for my absolute favorite anime, and tops the favorite lists of many others, for a very good reason. Call me an otaku fanboy, but I can’t rave about it enough. There are only two animes I’ve ever seen that I’ve given a 10/10, and this is one of them.\n        "},

It literally requires you to have read the manga or seen the previous anime.  The original series diverged from the manga and became something truly special because of it.  Brotherhood, while being very true to the manga moves at such absurd speeds as to literally ruin it.  It leaves absolutely no room for characters to establish themselves or breathe.  The show assumes you're either a fan of the previous anime or the manga and does nothing but pander endlessly to\n          \n        people who claim \"BEST EVER\" because they get to see their favorite character in their favorite scene.  It's a real shame, because there was a lot of potential here ruined by Bones pandering towards the established fans.  The series slows down to an acceptable pace at around the twentieth episode, but by then the damage is already done. \nOther than its problems with pacing, story and characterization, the art and animation are fantastic.   The voice acting in both languages is superb.  The soundtrack really works well with it as well.\n        "},

I do not consider myself to be a critic in any way, and I just rate my series depending on how much I appreciate them. Just so you know. I have watched hundreds of anime series ever since I was a kid, starting with Dragon Ball Z all the way up to (to date Aug 25th, 2017) Owarimonogatari second season (which is getting extremely high ratings, too!). \nBetween those two shows I have seen what many\n          \n        people consider to be the elite series ever (Evangelion, Death Note, Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass, Gintama, Attack on Titan and so forth). Furthermore, I have seen excellent, great, good, decent, and bad shows too, so I do consider myself to have some kind of experience in measuring the greatness of series. This is why, with my experience, I consider Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to be the best show that I have seen as of today.\nI have my favorite shows that I absolutely love and this show is not on that list. But I know those, within their greatness, have their flaws. And although Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is not perfect, I have to admit that nothing has come closer to perfection quite like it. \nThis show made me understand that regardless of one's bias, greatness has to be applauded like it should. \nEvery single aspect of it was perfectly executed: story, characters, animation (Wrath's fighting always looked sick), themes, writing, soundtracks, openings, endings, creativity, depth, heck even the previews were perfectly narrated to match the tension of each episode. Lead role is excellent, supporting characters are as good as (probably better) most main characters from other series. The way the story unfolds and ends is genius, and the diversity that this series brings allows each viewer to take different messages from it, which is why we fans (at least I!) watch. \nOpening/Ending theme songs are top class, specially during the episodes leading to the \"Promised Day\" (this is no spoiler, btw) where you feel like you want to just get inside the TV screen and support whoever it is you like (just listen to \"Rain\" during those episodes, and you will see what I'm talking about). \nThe show had an ending that most people would not expect while watching the series, however, it felt just perfect again. It shut the door to an inspiring, thrilling, long, agonizing, fun, and perfectly executed story, that, until you've seen it, you have not seen it all. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the best anime series that I have seen. \nScore: The Anime Standard. \n08/25/2017\n        "},

They travel several locations, figure out one major conspiracy involving homonculi and its leaders, in which by  the end everything falls full circle as it ends in a very satisfying way.

The fight scenes are amazing and are very sharp, something STUDIO IG is mostly known for, now BONES takes its spot. The Characters themselves are very unique and believable, they go through though times and deal with it in their own way, something Mr. Eren Yaeger does not know how to do and only complains about everything, so annoying! From the characters of \"Father\" to \"Von Hohenheim\" they have their own goals and make their way toward it. The sound gets a 10/10 because through all scenes it is as if a symphony orchestra is right next to you, scenes can go from sad to shocking as the music adds so much emotion toward the scenes. \nEnjoyment and Overall : 10 (9.8 Rounded) \nI can now understand why this show is beloved by all and has such a high ranking. It is considered as \"Masterpiece\" by some while others it is one of the best shows they have seen. This anime, much like another anime called \"Monster\" (Check it out) are considered \"epics\" to me. They have a large cast, we see each character more than once, they go through a variety of different settings, have important themes and have great villians, in which sometimes you feel for the villians themselves (Envy). If you have time, make sure to watch this, you won't regret it!\nP.S. If deciding between FMA: BH and FMA (2003), pretend that anything before 2009 does not exist, the original does not follow the manga AT ALL and SO MANY characters are different than how they should be, it also has an anime only ending. Watch FMA:BH because it stays closer to the manga, has better animation, better sound and an overall theme, then watch original.\nCheck out my reviews on my page for more of the best anime of all time!\nAnd how to stay away from the WORST anime of all time.\n\nBye"},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=15,   ["text"]="                          \n    Directed by Yasuhiro Irie and produced by studio BONES, ‘Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood‘ is a 64 episode adaptation of  Hiromu Arakawa‘s original manga and a tangential successor to 2003’s ‘Fullmetal Alchemist‘. Heralded by many to be one of the greatest anime of all time, ‘Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood‘ (hereupon referenced simply as ‘Brotherhood‘) could be considered a ‘rite of passage’ into the depths of anime fandom and/or the anime ‘sphere’ in general by many an anime fan. Thus, three years following my traipse into the world of anime, I approached this beast tenuously and left with my emotions and opinions varied. Did I like ‘Brotherhood‘? Yes,\n          \n        quite a lot in fact. Is it the greatest anime of all time? Not by a long shot. The following review will take into account the factors of story, animation, sound and characters, each component ultimately attributing to a final score. Note that this review is entirely subjective (thought it attempts on the whole to be as objective as possible) and I welcome  open discussion in the comments below…\n[Story – 8/10]\nThe initial story of 'Brotherhood' is by and large very simple: two brothers set out on a journey to fulfil their goal(s) and encounter many obstacles along the way. Indeed, everything that occurs during the course of the 64 episodes could be seen as 'yet another' obstacle preventing the Elric brothers from achieving their goals and I believe this is where 'Brotherhood's story shines: a typical shounen presents the viewer  with the main character and their goal(s), e.g. Naruto and his ambition to be Hokage, Luffy and his search for the One Piece, etc. A good or great  shounen presents the viewer with the latter whilst proffering a story that doesn't feel like a buffer and content that doesn't appear a preventative measure taken in order to elongate the shounen (an issue that to this day has prevented me from finishing 'Dragon Ball Z'). In this sense 'Brotherhood' is an astounding success: everything that occurs - every arc, every character introduction, every seemingly misplaced scene - contributes in some way to the shows larger, overarching story, blending into a whirlwind final set of episodes that leave the viewer in awe of the anime's scope and the writers vision. Coherence and a fulfilling culmination in a series longer than 50 episodes is a feat in and of itself, never mind the fact that said story is both gripping and enthralling. For 64 episodes, the viewer and the characters alike are left to follow a trail of breadcrumbs, minor story details that are just enough to keep the viewer satisfied till the next 'big' expository plot-point, leading to a conclusion that delivers on its promise of a full loaf (my apologies, time to stop with bread analogies...) and then some! Even the chemistry, physics and biology of the 'Brotherhood' world were interesting, alchemy being a well developed concept in its own right, bar a few 'it's an anime' misgivings...\nAll that taken into account, I suppose a question must then arise: why only an 8? 'Brotherhood' is 'deep', philosophical, waxes and wanes poetic and hell - it even resolves battle sequences in the 21 minutes within which they begin (I'm glaring at you, 'Dragon Ball Z'...)! But there are several issues - minor niggles - that mire an attempt at otherwise cohesive storytelling: the presentation of thematic issues, the inconsistent tone and a flat, uninspired ending. 'Show don't tell' is a literary technique employed to allow experience through subjective observation rather than objective exposition: one of the minor issues I had with 'Brotherhood' stemmed from it's presentation of it's thematic issues, it's almost dogmatic preaching of them and it's over reliance on a didactic formula, harbouring no trust in the audience to draw their own conclusions - an irksome 'flaw' that cropped up on occasion and left me rolling my eyes once too often. 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' was and is the epitome of 'show don't tell' done well and all too often 'Brotherhood', in spite of it's 17+ rating, falls into the rut of 'typical shounen' and speaks to its audience as though they are children, leaving an unsavoury taste once the initial digest in complete.\nMy second issue - and the most 'distasteful' - is that of the show's inconsistent tone. From the offset, 'Brotherhood' is dark and gritty and whilst humour on occasion is not at all unwelcome (and is often done well within the shows 64 episodes), the constant inundation of poorly timed 'jokes' and attempts at humour draws the audience out of any semblance of immersion they may once have had. For example - and a minor spoiler here for those of you who want to go in completely unspoiled - there is a female character in the show who, like the Elric brothers, has committed alchemical taboo. She loses her ability to have children and other organs as a result and during the course of the show - for comedic effect - constantly and consistently vomits blood, a running gag that is neither funny nor appropriate given that this happens only moments after her immersive 'back-story' is presented to the audience. This level of inconsistency is strange and spoils an otherwise totally immersive experience, again, leaving me only to roll my eyes as yet another serious moment is concluded with yet another cliché gag... That said, the constant mocking of Mustang's inability to use fire alchemy when it rained was never unwelcome, poor wet matchstick that he was.\nMy final gripe - and it is a minor one - is that of the ending which is at once fulfilling and yet leaves something to be desired. I can't obviously divulge too much without meandering into spoiler territory, however I can say that - on a positive note - all of the major and minor plot points are tied up: nothing is really left to the imagination (minor romantic interests aside). My problem however, was its simplicity - a level of happiness that did not entirely befit the shows thematic aspirations. I'll leave it at that and to you, the viewers discretion to decide whether or not the ending was entirely satisfactory, but I digress...\n[Characters - 7.5/10]\nThe characters are another major selling point in 'Brotherhood' the quality and development of even some of the minor characters leaving me in amazement. Each character is more than a cliché or a trope; the dynamics between them leaves a lasting impression on the audiences that causes the latter to care for each individual far more than in most anime, leading to a roller-coaster of thrills and frights as each character edges closer to and overcomes various threats, both seen and unseen. I think it's also important to note that characters do die in 'Brotherhood', that 'Game of Thrones', 'Attack on Titan'-esk quality that makes them so popular and so addictive. Even the various antagonists are developed enough that, when/if they die, the viewer is left feeling emotionally conflicted, contrary to the expected feelings of overwhelming satisfaction. I do feel however - and this is my only gripe, major though it is - that some characters are more developed than others (one word away from an 'Animal Farm' reference there...): characters who are developed to a greater extent in 2003's rendition are often times less so in 2009's adaptation and this unbalanced approach to character development has multiplex effects on an anime that would have otherwise flawless characters.\nTake the character Major General Olivier Mira Armstrong (a full title awarded here for emphasis): what purpose does she serve other than to be the 'bad-ass female'? She's angry, she's broody, she hates her wimpy brother...and that, dear viewers, is all the show has to offer from the good Major. Compare her to Mustang or even Winry and one begins to see that a character who is prevalent for at least most of the shows latter half pales in comparison to even the main characters love interest! Lust, whose character development truly pales in comparison to her 2003 counterpart, is relegated to the role of the mere and simple villain, a character development crime if I've ever seen one. The main villain(!) who is seen only fleetingly throughout the show till his back-story is fully divulged elicits no greater reaction than acknowledgement and at worst negligible sympathy, paling again in comparison to the shows other, 'minor', antagonists... It's a shame, really, one the deducted from my enjoyment of the show and one the forces me to give the shows characters a good, but borderline average rating... And don't even get me started of Alfonse and his good damn apple pie (which, might I add, we never see him eat!).\n[Animation - 7/10]\nIn any anime over 24 episodes there are going to be animation issues. Don't misunderstand me, 'Brotherhood's animation is at almost all times 'good', edging towards at the very least 'very good', but I was never truly impressed. Colours are often flat and uninteresting and character designs somewhat strange (e.g. Edward's telly-tubby-esk strand of hair and Mustang's overly-round head...) and on occasion the background details leave something to be desired. That said, 'Brotherhood's animation is almost always crisp and battle sequences are vibrant, detailed and enthralling - fundamental necessities when one considers that we are dealing with alchemy (i.e. magic). As the show progresses and the scale of battles increases, not only does the animation remain as detailed above, it actually increases in quality, giving those final battles the extra umph required to making them that much more interesting and that much more intense. There's not much more to be said of the animation other than that its quality stand on par with the shows quality - and there's not much more you can ask for from a shounen now, is there?\n[Sound - 7/10]\nI'll be honest: a part from a few select tracks, I didn't entirely notice 'Brotherhood's soundtrack... It was satisfying and valuable, don't misunderstand what I'm saying, however, in moments without tension or on such an epic scale, 'Brotherhood's soundtrack becomes simply ambient noise. 'Sound' quality is of course one of the more difficult categories to rate as ones enjoyment of an anime's soundtrack is fundamentally and entirely subjective: my favourite opening was the first and my favourite ending was the fourth, however, that said, I've spoken with others who've watch this anime and whose opinions differed entirely from my own to both extremes. Ultimately, in my opinion, it was good, however I leave it for you, the reader, to decide whether or not you enjoy it. If at this point the story and characters alone are enough to interest you, then I suggest you go and watch 'Brotherhood' now; the soundtrack is complimentary and will only add to your enjoyment of the show. That said, it's not one that I would personally go out and buy...\n[Conclusion]\n‘Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood‘ is a great anime, one that anyone who calls themselves an anime ‘fan’ must watch at least once in their life and one that will be spoken about for years to come. A compelling and cohesive story, with excellent characters, impressive thematic breadth and crisp, clean animation that is pleasant to the eye, ‘Brotherhood‘ excels as one of the greatest shounen offerings to date and – best of all – it has no filler! A miracle if I ever did see one. In all honesty, I’d recommended – if you have the time/the patience – watching the original 2003 anime first, if only to see character development in characters who severely lacked it in this rendition. And to my overall enjoyment… Despite several flaws in the presentation of an otherwise wonderful story and lopsided character development… I loved almost every minute with this complicated and personable cast whose stories (bar a few…) ended beautifully and whose presence is still felt, long after having finished the show – and if that’s not the sign of a good anime, I don’t know what is…\n- Chris.\n"},

What could be so special about just some fight-kill shounen anime?” and at the end...I was at loss for words. Because it is VERY WELL DONE. There is some debate about “Which series is better? 2003 or 2009” But I will get to that later. \nStory 10/10\nOverall: Slow buildup nonetheless very coherent and strong story\nminus point: first 15 episodes’ pacing problem and its comedy. \nThe story itself is VERY coherent and complete. It follows the original manga from start to end, so no fillers\n          \n        and every episode has some meaning and connection to its end. Brotherhood series is comparable to jigsaw puzzle that you get pieces from here and there and at the end, everything comes together as a beautiful picture conveying one message. But. there are few irritations mainly based on pacing and comedy placement. This is what original fullmetal alchemist attack most on its brother and it is true. The first 15 episodes or so is very rushed and comedy is a bit uncontrolled. But after that, pacing problem gets settled and comedy.... you kind of get used to it. Also another problem is that although finale proportion more than makes up for the wait, you have to get through first tens of episodes to get to the most intense part which is the last 10-20 episodes. \nArt 10/10\nOverall: Top notch quality. Unique character design and beautiful scenary. Rare deformed art. \nminus point: Those who have seen original might not like it. Not to standard “MOE” art too. Well.. I could sum it up as personal preference(Although I prefer brotherhood, I like original art style)\nAnother point that originals point out about brotherhood. Personally I prefer original style because it just has more slimmer, cuter character design. But, once again, not much of a problem- the art itself is very clear, scenary well described and overall well-done too. Although it does stand apart from the standard “MOE” art. Quality is once again very top-notch and character design.. need I say more?\nSound: 9/10\nOverall: Well going along ops, eds and some memorable ones too. Great bgm.\n......maybe not as memorable as original though...\n Once again in comparison to the original series. First op-YUI “Again”, First ed- Sid “Uso”/ Second op-NICO touches the wall “Hologram”, Second ed- “Let it out”/ Third op-Sukima Switch “Golden time lover”, Third ed Tsunaida – Lil'B/ Fourth op Chemistry “Period”, Fourth ed Scandal “Shunkan Sentimental/ Fifth op Sid ”Rain, Fifth ed “Ray of light”/ The op and ed are pretty well placed, especially second ending which had many episodes which literally needed some “letting out” and fourth op and ed. The most preferred op in brotherhood generally in western fandom is “Period”. I am from Asian country which also has many, MANY brotherhood fans and the best song of the whole series is considered to be Sid’s “Rain”. Not only good ops and eds, It has some amazing bgms too. The best example would be “Trisha’s lullaby” or “Main theme” from soundtracks. Especially, FANTASTIC JOB with placing “Main Theme”. If you watched it, you will know what I mean and if you haven’t why don’t you check it out yourself?\nThough... there are lots of fans that in terms of soundtrack, original series did better.. and I kinda agree. Still top-notch though. \nCharacter 10/10(maybe even more)\nOverall: Right kind of growth to each and every character. 3d character that is independent of the show’s main protagonist and has his or her own goals. \nI have seen many reviews that point out good character development, but usually they don’t point out “how” Because original series did a superb job on thinking about humanity and deep ptsds and mother complexes and such, the character development of brotherhood is considered to be shallow but if you really think that, you may have to rethink the meaning of “character development”\nThe main viewpoint is that how main protagonist “Edward Elric” who is child prodigy, goes on to learn what he believed to be the strongest merit of human being is actually not and learns what makes human really great. To further elaborate would be spoiler but after finishing the series, if you compare some of the attitudes he showed and some lines he blurted out from the start and the end of the series, you will see the distinct difference. And what protagonist gets to realize is actually the main point of the story. \nNot only the main protagonist, Scar, Ling, Roy are the main characters that get very coherent and well character development throughout the story. It is very easy to miss how they grew and developed but if you pay attention to it, you’ll see how author gave them the right kind of hardship and epiphany in order for them to move foreward. I am actually going to elaborate on that point down below, but its gonna contain some major spoilers so you’ll just have to watch it if you want to see it. \nAlso, another main character gets highlighted but saying who it is may also be spoiler for you.....Let’s just say he just so strived to become human, and makes a nice contrast to another major antagonist. \nNot only that, many characters, down to one-episode character has a chance to shine its value. While many shows highlights main character too much that other character’s fight and struggle becomes appetizer for the main fight, there is none of that. \nAlso, what I would like to point out is that many characters that plays major role to the story is not dependent on the main character’s main goal. All the major characters have different goals but in order to achieve there separate goals, they have to overcome something together, and that’s why although fullmetal alchemist brotherhood series is a series for Elric brothers, it could easily be another series seen from other character’s point of view... which is kind of realistic because well, all people are protagonist of their own life and has different individual goals right?\nEnjoyment 10/10\nOverall: Brotherhood is the series I preferred and many agree that plot-wise it is a bit more coherent and well constructed, but some of the elements are superior in original.. It all comes down to personal preferrences I suppose. Solely on its evaluation, it is great, in comparison to original, I believe it is superior too.  \nNow, this is the part where I get to the core point of the review. Will you like it? The answer is, if you like shounen, well-told coherent plot, opitimistic, a bit idealistic views, you will like it. \nNow then, what is the difference between brotherhood and original series?\nBrotherhood is a greater scale of story which focuses on not only the Elric brothers but other character’s development to convey a message about humanity as a whole. Its basically about seeking answers to “What makes human great” and it the process you will see many weaknesses of human itself and how each character overcomes it. Basically, much more oriented towards “what the anime tried to convey” I’ll get to that more specifically on spoiler zone. \nOriginal story is a smaller scale of story which focuses more on Elric brothers and drives to the core question of humanity “Is human great?” And by which means, the atmosphere is uncomparably darker, and because it focuses more on side story and each character’s tragedy, although its shounen, it closely goes in area or Seinen. \nNow what to watch?\nIf you like heartbreaking sorrowful story that focuses more on characters, I recommend original. If you like story that has greater scale and has fights and like hopeful atmosphere, I recommend brotherhood. While original has some fillers, it does has its own coherent storyline, so I have no intention of counting that down. Actually, it is one of the best original storyline animes ever had that deviates from the manga. But, despite the excellent job of original, I prefer brotherhood. Plot wise and the wrap-up of the brotherhood is more clean, and all wrapped up. Also, how the brotherhood places each and every elements and characters are poetic to the point you get to doubt “Is this really an anime?” \nAnd now.. the highlight of the review- \nSpoiler Zone- \nWhat is this show trying to say and how it was conveyed. \n The main point of the show is, as I have said repeatedly “What makes human great?” This is actually shown by so many symbolism and character development. \nCharacter development\n  First, let’s think about Edward Elric, the main protagonist of the series. His father left the house when he was very young and his mother died too. Combined that with brilliance in alchemy, he became a person who was fiercely independent as to not relying on anybody to the point he was arrogant. He thought alchemy was the key to everything, even to the point he thought he could bring his mother back with his alchemy skills. Some might disagree with me, but although it was out of desperation it was also an utter, undeniable arrogance. Who does he think he is that he could bring a human being back solely out of its ingredient? \n  He has seen atrocity of alchemy at the start point of the show, but still at that point, he thought alchemy was answer to all and still was fiercely independent. \n  He slowly realized alchemy could not be answer to all by realizing the atrocity of it. He seems homunculus, he finds out philosopher’s stone, hell, he sees a small girl turned into a chimera with no solution whatsoever to turn her back. Experiencing all this, he sees, “Alchemy cannot possibly be answer to everything.” \n  Also, not relying on others and trying to solve everything by himself could be seen in the act of going to Lab 5 alone which he gets scolded from Ross “Why don’t you trust adults more?” He refuses to listen to Greed just because he was angered which also he was reprimanded by greed “Succumbing to anger, will you lose valuable information and your brother?” This makes a nice contrast when he agrees to go under homunculus greed to fight against father saying ‘he can’t lost valuable information just because of his pride.“ Also, at Liore he just said to the priest ”I’ll teach you the difference between you and me“ to facing father which come the same line replacing ‘I’ to ‘we’. This also relates to the final confrontation to the Truth which Edward says ”I was from the beginning a mere human, who couldn’t even save a little girl.“ After that he says ”It is okay because there are everyone“ He has found his answer that what makes human great is not alchemy but interaction between the human beings which is one of the important message of the story. Note that Ed was the one who killed homunculus Pride-creepy symbolism there\nSummed up: An arrogant child who thought alchemy was the answer to everything killed pride, and had to give up his source of pride(alchemy) to bring back what he lost from pride. \n  Moving on to other characters, Scar is also a notable character. Consumed by vengeance, he just becomes nothing but a serial killer. But while doing that, what made him doubt his path was Winry and his memory of his brother. Although there were many instances that led Scar to turn to protagonist’s side, the most shocking moment was the dejavuu which he was in the position of Kimblee and Ed and Winry was in the position of he and his brother. It could be seen that what caused Scar to get out of the never ending circle of vengeance to the rightful anger was job of both his deceased brother and Winry. This is what I mean by what human makes human great is interaction between humans. After overcoming the blind anger, he was truly able to revenge the true culprit of his tragedy-King Bradley\nSummed up : A human consumed by blind vengeance has to learn to swallow and control his anger and cooperate whom he hated so much(Amestrians) to really kill the source of his wrath-King Bradley(homunculus wrath)\n  Next is Ling. Ling although is portrayed almost constantly good character was one the verge of line which he could have been consumed by greed. At the first appearance, he demanded philosopher’s stone and questioned the secret to binding a soul. When he did receive homunculus greed, he was actually overwhelmed by it except when Ed mentioned Lan Fang and Fuu. He learned not to succumbed or consumed by greed, but rather work with it towards the end to achieve his goal- a rightful growth considering he had no experience of dealing with greed (unlike mustang who was controlling his greed on the path of careerist) and if he got to be a ruler of a country, a trait he must have. \nSummed up: A prince consumed by greed had to learn to work with it than rather being consumed by it lost Greed and got what he had greed for(throne).\n  Next is Alex Armstrong. A big softy with no heart of steel to stay in the military to fight against it, nor rebel against it nor accept the duty ‘ran away’ from the cruel reality of Ishval war. Quite indolent compared to Roy, Riza or even his own sister. But after he chose not to be indolent, he stands together with his sister who reprimanded his indolency most to defeat Sloth and contributed to changing the military’s reality-something which made he indolent in the past. \nSummed up: A soldier caught with indolency faced with cruel reality, overcomes it and defeats Sloth with his sister and contributed to changing the reality. \n  Finally, Roy Mustang, who was also in the line of succumbing to blind wrath and vengeance which was prevented by Riza Hawkeye. \nHomunculus death\n Wrath is killed by human(Scar) wrath and god(sun) wrath combined\n Greed sacrifices himself to his greed(for companion)\n Lust is killed by womanizer’s(Roy's) care(perhaps love) for his subordinate(perhaps lover)(Riza)\n Envy is kills himself out of self loathe after his envy is exposed\n Sloth gets killed fighting too hard. \n Pride is diminished by Edward’s pride\n Gluttony is eaten.\nMain Theme\n“We humans may be weak, but because we don’t give up and go forward, because we have other people to support us, because we know our weaknesses and struggle to overcome them, we are able to become great.”\n  Humans may be weak- it is told throughout the story borrowing homunculi’s lines, and the atrocity of humans. A child(Edward) consumed by arrogance was let down by his failure. A soldier(Roy Mustang) who tried to serve country had to massacre hundreds of people. Another soldier(Armstrong) ran away from cruel reality. Brilliant mind(Dr. Marcoh) was forced to commit human experiments. A priest(Scar) upon seeing his brother and people’s death became blind with vengeance. Humans were caught is some experiment and became something they didn’t want(Ling, Hohenheim.)\n  A weak human was just a mere human with no power to change anything. \n  But, amidst that, they couldn’t give up and went on. (Ed, Roy, Alex Armstrong, Ling, Hohenheim...etc.) In the process, they had many support. The child gained new arm and leg to walk with his own feet(Support from Winry). When succumbed by anger, there was someone to stop him from going rampant(Roy-Riza) The soldier caught with indolence had someone to reprimand him for it(Olivier Armstrong) The priest blinded by rage came to senses by his memory of his brother and a small girl(Scar-his brother and Winry) A man who became philosopher’s stone had the courage to go for journey to become human because he had support of his wife(Trisha) and power to go up against father by support by millions of souls(Xerxesians) The prince was able to keep himself being consumed because of his people(Yao clan and his people) \n  Final fight which Father is alone with no whatsoever back up and all humans go up against him and Edward’s statement toward god is a great confirmation to to message it was willing to deliver - Humans become great because despite many shortcomings, we do not give up and go on with people to support our backs. That is the core theme of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Simple but coherently delivered huh.\nThat’s why I love this anime. \n        "},

I know this series supposedly follows the manga but that's probably my problem. I've seen some shonen anime and the plot usually isn't the best thing about it, especially the ending.

I don't exactly know what's different ( I think they didn't use as many shadows) but the art seems worse, less dark which probably fits the shonen story better.\nI can understand why a lot of people like this version of FMA better, it's probably because of the same reason why shonen anime are among the most popular, but I think some of the tragedy and consequences of equal trade that were present in the original FMA were lost in this series.\n        "},

The flow of the story along with the character development feels organic as supposed to FMA where sometimes certain characters\n          \n        felt as if they were forced into the scenario and their presence or absence did not make much of a difference to the overall plot. \nBrotherhood's pacing, along with its animation style, voice acting and soundtrack make it perhaps one of the best anime ever created.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=19,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    To start off, i should clarify that the original FMA is one of my favourite anime's, so to say that brotherhood 'tops it' is not a simple statement be me. \nAt first i was actually reluctant to watch brotherhood simply because i felt they were down playing how good original was. So pure stubbiness kept this wonderful experience from me, but could you blame me? There was a lot of hype about brotherhood, and to me the selling point was that it was a different ending to the same story i loved, but i later released that is far too understated of what the differences\n          \n        really are.\nSo i finally decided to watch it after a saw the first episode on t.v. and i agreed it was a much better looking anime than original and the fact that it was still the same characters i loved, so why not see the difference. So off i went and ask my older brother for his copy.\nOnce it started i noticed immediately this anime was created for the original fan base and not an alternative to original, which ups its appeal for me. All the beginning story lines are fast passed so u don't feel your just sitting through original again, plus there are surprising changes(which i shall not spoil); so if u haven't seen original it can be a bit full on and \"a lot of info in a short time\" (as my friend who i showed brotherhood too, who hadn't seen original said) but its not impossible. i still maintain to this day too see both!\nAnyway, as the story progresses and you feel all secure knowing what's happening and (u think) you know where this is all going, until BANG! CURVE BALL, and suddenly your whisked away onto a totally amazing story completely different to original. These anime's stand alone! So it doesn't really matter which u start with or if u choose to just watch one (which is a same), but this said Brotherhood is better. And here's why:\nWell for one big point : Winry.\nHOLY CRAP that annoyed me in original, and my brothers can vogue that my first sentence once the movie that finishes original's story ends i seriously was like \"Ummmm wtf about Winry?! They seriously (spoiler)  just leave her!!\" and i think i cried but that doesn't matter.... \nIn brotherhood not only do u see a lot more of Winry, you get a BACK STORY, AND DEVELOPMENT! HOLLY SHIT! And its very good. In original it was always left up to inturprritaion as too what Winry was to the Elric brothers, but now we get to see her story pan out and its supper well done.^_^. \nAnother reason as to why Brotherhood is better than original is : The GATE/GOD/THINGY\nThis part of the anime makes so much more sense and doesn't make me want to brake open my skull and pull out my brain. That's not saying original did amazing with what they had, i just think brotherhood doesn't stretch belief as unbelievably. \nAlso the previous fact leads to my last reason : THE MOTHER FUCKING BEST.ENDING.EVER!\nWhen original ended there was no sense of happily ever after. It just left off (spoiler) with that sense of the unknown, a guaranty that the story wasn't in fact over and a great big SQUID! ALL THAT SUFFERING AND THAT GREAT BIG, LONG JOURNEY AND YOU DON'T GET ANY RESOLUTION! That always bugged me but i could forgive original cause the journey was in fact amazing and i really love the beginning. But with Brotherhood, there was none of that. You know exactly were the characters stand at the end and everything is tied up with a beautiful bow! (SPOILER, not to mention babies!!! So cutttteeeeee! XD )\nSo now that i've said all this before you watch brotherhood, i still suggest watching original first. I am one of though's people who saves the best parts of her food for last, or how i really think about it, end on the best flavour :) \nOriginal is longer too, so i feel you really can bound with the characters before starting Brotherhood, which makes the ending all the more satisfying! \n(You don't have to by any means, i just think its the best way to experience FMA)\nSo here's my rating for this anime:\nStory: 10/10 a wonderful beginning, middle and end. Plus it flows organically, and you're never bored. \nArt: 9/10 Fluid, better defined colours and breath taking action. All the characters look better \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=19,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Brotherhood was my third attempt at getting into Fullmetal Alchemist. I had sampled the manga when it was still running, but never continued past the first volume. I had seen a few episodes on TV, but never in order. I had also seen so much fan art and hype in its heyday that I felt sort of pre-burnt-out on the whole thing. So, when a couple of friends sat me down to start Brotherhood, I wasn't sure I'd get into it. I was totally wrong.\nFMA:B Brotherhood is complex and satisfying. It follows a pretty ridiculous amount of plot threads and characters with surprising finesse. Despite\n          \n        its length, filler is minimal. It does action and emotion with equal grace. The cast is huge, but I can't say there's a character that I didn't find unique, important and memorable. The pace is fast enough to stay exciting, but slow enough to stop and smell the roses. It would be easy for an anime with a cast and story this size to be overwhelming and confusing. Luckily, Brotherhood is a pro juggler. It'll toss you pretty far, but it will never drop you.\nI'm a huge fan of the art. Character design is really Hiromu Arakawa's greatest strength, and I feel that FMA:B got the love, attention and budget it deserved to tell its story. The animation is consistently great and never cheaps out on the important stuff. The BGM is quality (although a few specific pieces get noticably overused) and every OP/ED is catchy.\nIf I had to nitpick something, I'd say that FMA:B does suffer from some tonal weirdness. Sometimes it spends a little too much energy on slapstick-- other times it wallows in its drama a little too long. I remember a specific episode where I wanted to yell \"JUST KILL HIM ALREADY\" at the rest of the characters as they stood around and listened to the wailing monologue of a dying villain. These are minor flaws completely outweighed by the rest of the series.\nFMA:B grabbed me and made me care when I wasn't expecting to. If you've never touched this series-- maybe thinking that you already know the plot so it'll be boring, or that it's going to be some typical shonen nonsense-- I'd really encourage you to give it a try. This is one for the Top 10 lists. I'll definitely be revisiting it in the future.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=19,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Well, this is my first review so please tell me if you found this helpful or not so I can do a better one the next time :)\nI heard about Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood from a friend of mine and I really postponed watching this show... At this moment I feel like an idiot. This show was a masterpiece in all the directions it could and after finishing it I was completely astonished !\nStory (10/10) \nOK, at the first 2 or 3 episodes I was a bit confused and couldn't understand some things, but at the fourth episode I started to get what this amazing anime\n          \n        was about.\nAs it is said on the synopsis, it is about the Elric brothers trying to get back their bodies, after commiting the taboo of alchemy, trying to revive the dead using it. After failing and paying a heavy bill for even trying, with the older brother, Edward, losing limbs and the younger one, Alphonse, losing all his body, only for Edward to affix his soul into an armor, the story begins as Edward Elric, the older brother, becomes a State Alchemist, one who uses his alchemy for the military, in order to have a better chance of recovering their bodies. In the 3rd episode it's revealed that they are searching for the legendary Philosopher's Stone, wich is used for ignoring the basic rule of alchemy, the equivalent exchange. \nNow let me tell you that this isn't the real story behind Fullmetal Alchemist. The recover of their bodies comes at the second place of this anime, cause there are some more important things to take care first... the safety of the world for example...\nThis was a more detailed synopsis and a better one I think. \nNow let's move on to what I liked about the story. It is really a mind-blowing one, as the events that happened before the story started are mixed with the actual story. That combination will completely shock everybody. There are a few very important characters, everyone with his own story, amazingly explained and included in only one amazing storyline. The Elric brothers story, the Ishbal's Civil War story and the very dark story behind some unthinkable things will amaze you, but not only these, as there are some other very positive things about the story:\n- The plot and it's develop is uncomparable to any another anime I've seen;\n- It is very unpredictable and will surprise you every now and then;\n- It has some unforgettable funny moments, although being quite a dark anime\n- It has some very dramatic moments that will stay in your mind for a good amount of time;\n- The battles are fantastic, very strategic and enjoyable.\nBut there is also a negative side. Due to the rushed start, a death of somebody at the first 10 episodes that is a turning point in the story, didn't look that dramatic as it should have looked, but at the latter stages of the show, you'll understand the significance of that person's death.\nAt a certain point I thought that the end of this anime would ruin all, like Naruto's one, when that happy, unrealistic ending destroyed it. Luckily I was wrong, as the end not even was unfrogettable, but also at that point of the story nothing came for cheap.\nOverrall, the story is really amazing and worth a big 10.\nArt (10/10)\nAs a newly made anime, unlike the version of 2003, the art is breathtaking. There is a memorable animation quality, that we even now, in 2015, do not often see. The animation in the fight scenes is amazing and very fluid. \nThe character's design is very good too, as they are completely different from each-other. \nI think 'Bones' has turned this anime into a piece of art. Even the details of every character, that I greatly observe, are just fascinating.\nThe colours are great too, as I enjoyed very much the contrast between the bright and dark colours.\nSound (9/10)\nTo start with, I watched the subbed version, as I enjoy very much the japanese language. I didn' regret my choice.\nThe character's voices and their intonation was really class. This was largely due to the elite actors they hired for doing this job. But even the ones that want a dubbed version won't have problems, cause I happened to watch one episode in the dubbed version and it was nearly as good as the subbed version.\nThe first three openings were very addictive and I quite liked them. The other 2 openings were good too. The endings were great too, especially the fourth one.\nAs for the OST, there were some really fantastic ones for the tense, anxious and fight moments. Even the quiter ones were good and were played at the right moments.\nThe only problem is that there is a lack of character's theme, even if there are some kind of instrumental music. That's the only reason that I'll give it a 9.\nCharacter (10/10)\nThe characters of this anime are all very interesting and entertaining and they all have a bond with each-other in some way. They all have different powers as well as their own ambitions and to not forget, a dark past...\nAs we know the protagonists are the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric. Edward, also known as the Fullmetal Alchemist, or also as the youngest State Alchemist at only 15. He is stubborn, strong willed guy, leading the Führer President, the highest ranked person of the country, to code-name him Fullmetal. Alphonse Elric, the youngest brother, has a more calm and kind-hearted character than his brother. \nBut this show wouldn't have been a masterpiece if there weren't some absolutely cool guys supporting them. I will write down some characters that are worth watching with details:\n- Colonel Roy Mustang, Edward's superior at the military, is a cool,  a bit arrogant (like Fullmetal) and good-looking guy, whose ambition is to become the Führer President. He is presumably the strongest State Alchemist. In addition, he has some amazing, very reliable and funny subordinates, who make this show a damn comedy at times with the way they do things. Man, that's what I call teamwork! You should definitely take a good look at them. Roy also cares very much for his subordinates and protects them with everything he can. Have a good look at Maes Hughes, Riza Hawkeye and his other subordinates cause you're going to love them. \n- The Elric's brothers father, Van Hohenheim, abandoned his family when his kids were at a very young age. In the first episodes when he makes short appearances, he looks like a cold guy, but it turns out to be different, even though he has a very dark secret in his heart...\n- Mey Chang and Ling Yao have comed from the East in order to obtain the secret of immortality for their Emperor with the sole purpose of gaining his trust and saving their clans. Mey Chang and Ling Yao are enemies and their battle for gaining the secret is worth a good watching.\n- Solf J. Kimblee is a hero of the Ishbalan Extermination Civil War and on the first episodes frequently makes short appearences in a prison, with wood handcuffs and with two transmutation circles in his hands. Well, what can I say, he is a complete psychopath, but I really liked how the heck he acted during the show. Did I forget to tell you that he was prisoned cause he refused to give the army a Philosopher's Stone they gave him to exterminate the Ishbalans and that he ate it? Oh yes I forgot, sorry.\n- The antagonists in this show are all really badass, all immortal, very strong and part of the same \"group\". In that \"group\" are also 2 characters that I was completely shocked . That's as far as I'm allowed to tell you without spoiling everything, but they also have a very dark story and a very strange and sometimes confusing past.\nThe character's development makes this anime even better than first thought. Again a big 10.\nEnjoyment (10/10) \nI enjoyed this anime from the start till the end in the same manner. If you don't like it at the first few episodes don't drop it, just give it more time, cause I'm sure you'll love it.\nIt is very important to watch all the details carefully, cause it can confuse you sometimes if you don't watch it properly. Furthermore, it starts giving you clues of what's going on behind the scenes from the first episode !!\nWell, what can I say, I love this anime, so the enjoyment is 10.\nOverall (10/10)\nAs I said, I was a bit suspicious about this anime at the start, but I think I did the best thing when I started it. It's absolutely a fantastic anime that I'm sure everybody will enjoy !\nThank you for reading this review and I'm going to finish it with a quote from the protagonist, Edward Elric:\n\"A lesson without pain is meaningless. That's because no one can gain without sacrificing something. But by enduring that pain and overcoming it, one shall obtain a powerful, unmatched heart. A FULLMETAL HEART.\"\n"},

Watching this whole series, i was thirsty, thirsty for more enjoyment, humor and character development  each time i finish an episode. Definitely worth watching. The older series, Fullmetal Alchemist is a good anime, so i had high expectations for Brotherhood. The story line of these two series are slightly different but the plot remains the same. The shocking but amazing plot twists got me taken aback and sitting on the edge of my seat to see what else is coming. \nI laughed, I cried, I cheered. \nI also learned valuable lessons.\nAbout loving someone unconditionally even\n          \n        if you have to give up something that means the world to you, or even risking your life to the verge of death. Edward and Alphonse, the brothers, love each other to the moon and back, and even when their love reach the moon, it will come back to earth and keep itself alive. \nFullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood makes you question about the life they chose, about lust, wrath, sloth, pride, gluttony, greed and envy. \nHow does it feels to lose someone ? To sacrifice everything ? To watch the one you love lives in the whirlpool of despair? The answers lie within their beating hearts.\nDo i regret watching Brotherhood ? Yes because i ended up sleeping late every single night due to the undying excitement and no, simply because, it kills hours of my time watching this with love and enjoyment. \nIf i have to choose which one of the Elric brothers that i love the most, i will have to ponder over it for a long time, and i even might not get to choose. \nBoth of these characters equally contribute to the storyline. None takes the spotlight from the other. Both would sacrifice themselves, both would bear the pain for others' happiness, and both touched the hearts of people around them through their journey. \nIt is possible to love so many characters in one anime at once, at least that's how i feel towards them.\nWhether you like this anime or hate it, the choice is yours, but, this critically acclaimed series will slowly devour your heart and grows within you, and it feels good.

Yes, it was also shounen too. But that didnt bother me very much, after all I'm a sucker for action. But character development was different compared to the 2003 version, or so it seems to me. It is good that ed and al didnt even think about harming another soul till the very end, but after all they've been through, I thought they would at least put some thought in it, if it made sense. Like they did in 2003. I understand\n          \n        people think brotherhood is canon and characters in the 2003 version is OOC, but I just thought 2003 was a little bit more realistic in some ways.

But it is overall very enjoyable for just about everybody. That is the strength of this show; it caters to just about everybody. There are some very funny moments and those are balanced out by some very dark and serious moments. There is plenty of intense action that is quite literally non-stop, and quite frankly it makes DBZ looking boring. The soundtrack for this show is probably my all time favorite for any anime, and I have some the songs on my I-Pod. The plot is very\n          \n        intricate and just about everybody who is introduced in this story serves a role in developing that plot, and I think that is AWESOME. For 64 episodes long, I have never seen so many well flushed-out characters, but this anime achieves that no problem. The English Voice Dub is by far the best dub I have ever heard, and the voice for King Bradley is in a class of its own. I would recommend this to literally anybody, but especially those who like to see incredibly detailed and creative fight scenes. \nStory: 9.5/10\nThe first 12 episodes are rushed, but that is to be expected when you consider this is a reboot.\nArt: 7/10\nI personally don't like the way the characters are drawn, but the way the violence is shown (this is a very violent show) is pretty damn cool. People get maimed in this show quite a bit, and there is plenty of blood to go along with it.\nSound: Full 10/10\nI really mean this when I say the soundtrack is 10/10. That isn't like a 9.8/10 or whatever, it's a true 10. \nCharacter: 9.5/10\nThe main antagonist is a bit dry, but everyone else is loaded with personality.\nEnjoyment: 9/10:\nI personally wish there would have been more drama in this show. The original FMA did this PERFECTLY for the canon sequence of episodes, and this is probably the greatest flaw in the plot of the story. It lacked the same emotions the first FMA had.\nOverall: 9.5/10\nThis show really should be viewed as a masterpiece due to the fact the story never goes off on any tangents that are unrelated to the plot. It sticks true to its guns and never lets up. The final scene involving the main villain achieving \"GOD\" is probably the coolest thing I have seen in anime, and it really makes the show more interesting overall. I would recommend this show to anybody. It's amazing, but not quite perfect.\n        "},

I finished it in 4 days\n          \n        and I can officially say it's in my top 3 animes. I can't say too much because it will somewhat spoil the anime, but story is around Edward and Alphonse who are brothers, they go on through their adventure fighting many villians who are all creative and trust me I even liked some of the villians as they all had creative and beautiful back story and development. Story has sweet romance aswell, I would've literally killed for a kiss at the end atleast but oh well, still trust me you will love it, it will make you blush :3.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Cartoon Network isn’t what it used to be. As a kid, I watched CN because it had shows that appealed to tons of people, shows that had meaning, and shows that deserved to be labeled classics. Those shows are gone. Teen Titans, Samurai Jack, The Batman, Chowder, Kids Next Door, and more have been dismissed for garbage cartoons like Teen Titans Go! , Adventure Time, Ninjago, and Uncle Grandpa (No comment on those new Pokémon incarnations). With the exception of Clarence and Steven Universe, Cartoon Network is a joke. CN’s lone redeeming factor is Toonami, a late-night segment form Saturday evening to Sunday morning where\n          \n        various anime are featured, and one of them used to be Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\nI never liked Brotherhood; I love it. An avid reader of the FMA manga, I stumbled upon Brotherhood on Toonami and, form there, I was hooked. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is about two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who lose possession of their bodies as a result of breaking the most important rule in alchemy, attempting to resurrect the dead, and they journey across the country of Amestria as they attempt to reclaim their former selves. Edward Elric is this anime’s protagonist, the famed “Fullmetal Alchemist” whose legendary reputation is rivaled by his alchemical skills, the wise cracking prodigy with an unpredictable personality and a strong distaste for milk, and the height-conscious adolescent with a constant inner conflict about morality, a massive amount of confidence, and an unwavering dedication to his loved ones. If I were to make a list of the greatest anime characters, Edward Elric would be in at least the top ten. Alphonse Elric is the younger of the two brothers, a gentle and likable young boy trapped in a suit of armor that serves as Edward’s mediator during Ed’s explosive episodes (Al is often assumed to be the older of the two due to his height). Brotherhood ventures into a variety of places throughout Amestria, from the bustling business environment in Central City to the fear-inducing tunnels underneath the city, from the wind-driven snowflakes covering the Drachma region to the primal adobes in dust-consumed Ishval, and, in all of them, this anime crafts the setting with a razor-sharp eye for detail and an amazingly artistic flair.\nThe majority of FMA Brotherhood doesn’t focus on the Elric brothers but instead on the people surrounding them. Colonel Roy Mustang is my favorite character, an easygoing alchemist with the coolest power ever (He can unleash fire by – get this! – snapping his fingers!), and an ambitious leader that alternates between cracking jokes and being dangerously serious. There’s Winry Rockbell, a childhood friend of the Elric brothers and a gifted mechanic. There’s Scar, a sunglasses-wearing Ishvalan with a reputation as a malicious murderer and a mission to destroy alchemists of the military via alchemy. Brotherhood also contains a great group of villains in the Homunculi, the seven nearly-unstoppable immortal-like beings each with their own unique personality, and their Father. The two Homunculi that stood out to me were Greed (The Homunculi are named after the seven deadly sins), a rebellious man with steel-like skin, and Pride. Born from Nightmare Fuel, Pride is this anime’s most important villain excluding the main antagonist Father who I will remember most for that frightening scene with Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye. Excluding the emotionless Father, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has characters with great acting, emotion, complexity, and (above all) likability (Is this even a word?)\nThere are five main themes in Brotherhood; the final opening is by far the most emotional, but my favorite is the first, a fast-paced theme song that slowly intensifies at a pace with the opening’s singer. Plotwise, there isn’t a big difference in Brotherhood from the Fullmetal manga (although Isaac the Freezer never graced the FMA pages nor did Father Cornello evolve into a hulking beast), but the anime is still just as good, with more twists than a Twizzler stick and more energy than a kid on a sugar rush.\nPerhaps the greatest thing about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is its appeal to all genres. If you want tons of action, if you want a show with martial arts, if you want a military-themed anime, if you want some mystery to your show, if you want some sci-fi in your show, if you want a huge focus on adventure in your show, if you want some slice-of-life aspects to your anime, if you want to see buckets of blood, if you want to watch a show with fantasy elements in it, if you want to watch a dystopia-themed show, if you want to check out an anime with depth, then Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the series for you."},

This is the only series which I have rated a 10 on my entire list because, if we're being honest, it's bloody amazing.\nStory - The story is great, with brilliant scenes and emotional moments that would make anyone cry. There's one moment which I remember very clearly when Winry is holding a gun up to kill someone and Ed talks her down. Watching this was the first time I truly realised how amazing and inspiring an animated series could be. The plot is driven by the struggles\n          \n        that the characters must go through to achieve their goals, and how they suffer their way to the end. It's storytelling at its best and, while there are some cliches, you feel like you're going on an adventure with the main characters!\nArt - The animation is top notch and the character designs are stunning and realistic to their situations. There are characters from all kinds of origins and backgrounds- and their character designs reflect that in the best way. The animation is also so clean and smooth that I actually had to rewind every once in a while just because I wanted to see the scenes again and marvel at the production quality.\nSound- The opening and closing themes are honestly some of the most beautiful I've ever heard and fit perfectly with the mood and tone of the series. And, oh, the soundtrack! The soundtrack was a shining example of everything a soundtrack could be- blending perfectly into the scenes and giving them that extra 'oomph'. \nCharacter - The characters were absolutely the best characters I'd ever seen in an anime. Most shounen anime has a problem with characterisation, but FMA:B does it excellently! Ed and Al are very realistically brothers and are very realistically people, with their faults and their strengths. And the female characters? I haven't seen many anime that treat female characters so well and give them the same level of development as their male counterparts.\nEnjoyment - I was never bored watching this series and even the quieter moments in the story were entertaining, with the characters really carrying the plot (not that the plot needed carrying). \nThis is the best darn anime I've seen in a very long time, and it's an excellent first anime because it's set in a fantasy world, with no prior knowledge of Japanese customs needed to enjoy it and understand it!\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one of the most critically acclaimed anime loved by both connoisseurs and casuals.\nLet me start with the very first mentionable point to notice, which is a negative one. This anime expects its viewers to be already well acquainted with the franchise before watching it. So, the introduction is pretty straight forward and awkwardly so. I get that it has its alternative version or a manga with proper introduction. But, that's not Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and people would definitely not like to read the manga or another anime with 51 episodes before watching a 64 episodes anime just for a proper introduction.\n          \n        In Brotherhood, at the beginning, you see the characters doing whatever they do without you knowing what it is that they're doing, or even saying. \"Oh so he's the Fullmetal Alchemist!? Whatever the hell is a Fullmetal Alchemist anyway?\" So, yeah.\nDespite being awkward at the beginning, there is something that still makes it perceivable. You don't know the details, but you have a vague idea that something is actually happening, so the viewers are tempted to watch further to know what exactly was it as there were many flashy things going on and it felt like there was some meaning to it. It's a cheap trick to hook the viewers, but it worked. That's what saves it from being dropped at the very beginning, but the fact that it's awkward still remains. This is how it is for the first few episodes. After that you get rewarded for not dropping it earlier with some genius story composition. This anime's storyline considers a number of possibilities and takes the best path. Which ends up with a brilliant ending, that I consider one of the bests among happy endings. It packs up the whole series nicely, making it a complete story.\nThe anime has an overarching and well progressing plot handled carefully. I didn't notice any bothersome inconsistency after the opening episodes. The story isn't repetitive in any way. It's story is simple but has considerable depth to it.\nAlthough the characters who were introduced at first had improper introduction, I as a viewer got along with them as time passed. The characters introduced later on are well presented. But, the character development in this anime is very typical and genric. Bad guys get saved by the good guys, realize that they shouldn't follow the orders of the evil bosses and help the good guys on their own will. And someone gets violent as hell who doesn't feel strong restraint when killing someone almost overnight after a harsh experience. Something we haven't ever seen? The development on the good guys isn't remarkable and sometimes nonexistent. There are however some really good character development. For example, the slow and consistent development of that greedy man I forgot the name of who used to own a mine or something that he lost due to our MC, Edward Elric and some Homunculi. What's genuinely good about this anime's characters is the screentime distribution. This is very essential in this anime in particular, partly because it has many likable characters and it'd be really disappointing if they didn't get enough screentime.\nThe antagonism in this anime is shallow, with very weak reasons and goals to justify for all the dreadful deeds. The evil military personnel and some other bad guys are horribly one dimensional. The character interaction is decent, but could've been better. The overall cast is very well handled, nevertheless.\nI liked the world building in this anime. It makes big approaches by dividing the State, having different regions with different climate, culture, general attitudes and lifestyles. It makes medium approaches by having different cities, towns, countrysides, etc with their definite geological location and connecting them with consideration of distance and cultural transition. And finally, it makes small approaches by detailing the small points in the places where the story takes place in. It's attention to tiny details like mud on the body after crossing a muddy path, or dirts after falling on the ground were mesmerizing but never preachy. The anime makes no unrealistic or unbelievable change in the already established environmental points. Basically, it did excellent job on the places it shows. But unfortunately, it doesn't show majority of its world. We only get to properly see The State of Amestris. It gives a small idea of Xing through some of its characters from that empire, but that wasn't enough to relay a good description. We don't really even know if there's any other country aside from the State of Amestris, Xerxes and the Empire of Xing. And even if it did mention other countries, it must've been very unimpressive for me to remember or even notice. In short, it doesn't quench one's thirst for the view of its world. Then again, it's a good thing that the anime doesn't go out of its way to show around the parts of the world that aren't important, consequently not drawing the attention away from the story. I'd like to inform you that it has a town based on automails as well.\nAutomails are prosthetic limbs made of metal. The technology behind this element is not much explained, but I really liked it. How they presented that there is nerve connection and the pain of that time really made me feel it. I liked how there are so many types of automails. And loved the idea of having different types of automails for different weather. Basically I loved how they didn't leave it as it is just because it's not a main element and was used for more reasons than just showing Edward's resolves.\nThe main element, Alchemy, is an edited form of the Alchemy we know. Here, one can understand, break and reconstruct matters and that's what Alchemy here is. It's not very deep, but efficient. Aside from shooting pillars and rocks (like wtf!?), the use of Alchemy is very good. The difference in the usage of Alchemy between the West and the East is interesting. Alchemy is adequately crafted to satisfy a superficial view while also running the story, it's not enough explored to get past the highly functioning brains that like to go deep into analysis. But well, it doesn't need to be extremely deep and didn't do anything pretentious to make it deep either. The shooting pillars and rocks are still blatant though.\nThe power curve of this anime is very good. The MC isn't utterly overpowered. In fact, he's far outranked by many people. He trains, but doesn't become stronger than most of them which is really plausible. The overpowered villain is justified. I loved how in the end, the anime didn't pull any unnecessary, unbelievable, unreliable power up to defeat the overpowered villain.\nA bothersome point in this anime is the immortal army. FMAB does have a realism that it sticks to, but this particular point is slightly too unrealistically overdone considering its realism. It's not really much necessary either. I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have felt anything lacking if this wasn't here. The evil military personnel could've been brainwashed instead of tempted, which could've solved an aforementioned issue as well.\nAnyway, many of the shortcomings in this anime are obtained through nitpicking and are massively outweighted by its greatness. The plot points are tied very well so there's no considerable loose end. It's overarching with its elements and plot but still very well handled. There are sufficient job done on everything. It's philosophy is simple and unpretentious. The main philosophy that for getting something, there has to be a sacrifice of equal amount is an excellent example. It also tells us to not be too conceited. There are many other teachings relayed in the anime. Truth's vague existence actually plays well here.\nFMAB has great animation and cinematography. The artwork of the character design is good, but how it was used was slightly problematic. Especially when you can't tell that a seemingly man is actually a woman. The reason might be that almost all the faces are designed rounded and there are little difference in male and female facial construction. Well, I'm not sure if it's because of getting used to it or the improvement of the art, but it seems perfect later on. It's probably the latter but if just in case it is the former, then the anime does great job helping the viewers to get used to it. The attire design is excellent and the colors are masterfully used while designing the characters. It has some extremely well choreographed fight scenes which are exhilarating. This anime has by far one of the best collection of opening and ending songs if not the best. All of them are great. Some are easily top list materials. The background musics are remarkable as well. Loved Lapis Philosophorum in particular.\nThe atmosphere of this anime is not as dark as its former 2003 version and I found it more fitting. The lighthearted un-overwhelming atmosphere is a better choice here, imo.\nThis anime is superficially perfect. It's specialty is that it has almost everything you need to learn and can ask for from an anime. And there's no way to call it \"pretentious\". Overall, it's very well put together and definitely one of the best anime I've watched so far.\nIt's a tier 1 9/10 show.\n        "},

I decided to write reviews to practice my English while sharing my thoughts on anime/mangas I dedicated my time to, so errors are inevitable. I apologize for that in advance.\nStory: 9.5\nTwo brothers are left alone when their mother died. Trying to revive her with alchemy made things worse: the younger brother lost his whole body while the other lost his limbs. Now they're searching for a method to return their normal bodies. Doing their best to do that, they stumbled upon the planning of the worst disaster which is about to happen. Elric brothers along with their friends try to\n          \n        stop that.\nThe story is unique, the phasing and theme (Alchemy and equivalent exchange) are great. But I didn't give it a perfect score because I find it clichè-ish for a story to begin because of a sad/tragic experience.\nArt:8\nThe art meets the standard quality of the animes of that time. The fights are usually exciting. I love the characters' design but I didn't appreciate the mangaka's style. Maybe just my personal taste\nSound: 10\nVoice acting is excellent. The voice actors fit their characters. Roy's and Ed's are just heh!\nThe music is amazing. To start it off, YUI-Again and Tsunaida te are some of my favorites. But every op and ed are really likeable even though some needs time. Even the most hated op (golden time lover I think). The themes are awesome. They will really leave an impact to you, most of the time I had goosebumps (more goosebumps, for some reason, now that I'm rewatching it). Lapis philosophorum, Trisha's and Resembool's lullaby, and the main theme are the best.\nCharacter:9\nCharacter development and hardships are shown and explained perfectly. For example, a mass murderer full of hatred is now trying his best to reform the country without a war or a revolution. The relationship between the brothers is so strong. Seeing for the first time, I thought the main female would be an annoying and weak girl; I was wrong. Okay, she cried and was weak a couple of times but because of that she stood up, became Ed, Al and many other people could rely on. Villains did a great job pissing me off except Lust, I loved her.\n Enjoyment:10\nI really enjoyed this anime not only enjoyed but adored it. Good thing I watched it long after my cousin recommended it, because I was young and I'm sure i'm not gonna understand a thing (Having a sort of mystery genre). The negative thing is I watched the 1st series and it became a kind of spoiler at beginning. And I missed the Kyoudai soundtrack. \n---------- Spoilers-------\nBest scenes I totally enjoyed: the way they passed the note for the promised day, hawkeye and Roy's communications, main protagonist's last transmutation and many others that if I were to list it, Boom.

Then this came out and my mind exploded. If you never watched anime in your life and don't really like it, at least give this one a try. Everyone who watches anime will at least know of FMA B. The story.. is perfect. Things are not all that it seems. There is corruption, there is shady business, there is alchemy! Hell yeah! I like how they portray fascist state regime as well. The art for this anime is also perfect. At least for me, this is\n          \n        how I'd imagine characters to look like in anime. Also they aren't just your typical generic anime characters (although there are definitely some even in FMA).\nThere will be characters you don't like but for the most part, the characters are flawless and could not have been made any better.

Even if you're not a big shounen fan I guarantee that this will change your perspective about these types of anime. Overall it is an outstanding anime well worth watching all of the 64 episodes. \n     First of all, the story of this anime was amazing. The plot is developed in such a way that makes you more interested in it the more you watch it. It's absolutely incredible how much thought went into the\n          \n        main story as well as how they made it in order to trigger the viewers interest and make him enjoy what he is watching. The fight scenes may not be the best but they're certaintly intense. Moreover, this anime has an epic plotline that bounds to keep the viewer attached to the screen their watching it in.\n     Another reason why is this anime great is because of the art, sound and the characters. The art isn't really something special, its just typical animation you see in most anime but it was so carefully made and absolutely perfect that made it well worth mentioning in this review. The producers have done an amazing job with the soundtrack as well, from the opening and ending theme songs to the music playing while the story develops in each episode that just matches the situation completely. I am sure that you will love the music playing as much as I did. Moving on, the characters, generally the characters were very interesting due to the fact that each one of them had a different personality the good guys and the villains as well. There wasn't much of a character development but im sure you can overlook that flaw comparing it to the fact that everyone was different from each other.\n     Concluding, I really liked this anime due to its amazing story and plot development, its animation, its soundtrack and its characters. There isn't really anything else to say about why I enjoyed watching this show, I mentioned everything above. If you're a shounen fan then you probably have already watched it and if not then I suggest 100% to go see by yourself, also if you're not a shounen fan give it a shot it might even change your opinion. For all the above reasons FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets a final score of 10/10"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=18,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    What makes a show a masterpiece? How enjoyable it is? Lots of character development? A complex and interesting plot? Lots of symbolism and themes? Or maybe it's just based on the shows own hype and popularity? Well, it doesn't matter which it is because Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMAB) has it all. As probably everyone knows, FMAB is a remake of the original Full Metal Alchemist (2003) series; A remake that does pretty much everything right and makes an already great series into one of the greatest series ever. For those of you who have not seen Brotherhood, it is not a \"sequel\" or copy\n          \n        of the original, it's an alternate continuity that follows the manga more accurately than the original (original was created before manga was finished). This show is a must-watch to everyone, all ages and let me tell you why:\nI don't want to get too much into the plot since it'd be useless reading since you're going to watch this masterpiece and find out about it's story anyways. The story follows 2 young brothers, Ed and Alphonse Elric, and their struggles in achieving their personal quest.  Edward and Al Elric attempted unsuccessfully to revive their mother using the power of alchemy. In the failure process, the elder brother, Ed, loses a leg, and the younger brother, Al, loses his entire body. Ed manages to attach his brother's soul to a nearby suit of armor, at the cost of his right arm. In the midst of their quest, there are political and military conflicts alongside the darkness of human nature (pandora's box stuff). Greed? Lust? Envy? Gluttony? Truth/Lies? All aspects of our reality that people have to overcome, and FMAB portrays it perfectly. \nThe plot isn't complicated and symbolic at all yet it gives off the sense of an absolutely genius masterpiece. The show is \"mere\" 64 episodes (not enough for me). Because the show was so long, it had the opportunity to develop their plot to it's fullest potential, and oh boy do they deliver. 64 episodes, and there were absolutely no filler episodes where I was left bored. Skip parts of the show? Unthinkable. Brotherhood does a exceptional job of pacing itself into laying out the foundations of the story as a collection of pieces, and then connecting them all together throughout the series to create a cohesive, masterfully intertwined, and satisfying (tragic) ending. Starting with the very heritage of the main characters and the conspiracy behind the very formation of Amestris. Then the characters figuring out the \"truth\", having to deal with painful experiences, accepting reality/fate, and really growing as a human being. Then portraying the potential and corruption of human beings. With constant sensational battles both psychological and upfront confrontation to keep the viewers entertained... To the very ending where all the questions from the beginning/middle are answered, and the viewers are taught a valuable lesson about humanity-growing up and reality-not as dream-like as we'd like to believe as kids. Epic, Touching/Tragic, Funny, Magical, Simply Amazing. \nGreatest vast cast of characters in anime, period. There should be no debate. The main characters aren't given all the screen-time like other shows. FMAB shows the perspectives of so many characters (10+ maybe around 20? Yep--Amazing). What really touched me was that Ed and Al remained true to themselves until the very end. They don't change or learn anything that fundamentally changes them like most \"heroic characters\" They were originally innocent kids who made mistakes just like all human beings. Then they went on the journey to try and correct their mistakes, and through their journey, they learn that there are more things wrong with the world than their own follies; and to repent upon your sins in reality is something of an ambiguous thing... An interesting thing to look for is that although the Elric brothers are on their journey to find the philosopher stone and regain their body, they constantly give up on their quest for the sake of others, to help others, and that, is the true definition of heroism. The other characters aren't there to aid or prevent the Elric brothers achieve their goal, they're there with their own stories. Random characters meet together, and build friendship? Betray eachother/Fall in love? No. FMAB isn't childish like that. But of course, all of the character's pasts and stories all intertwine with one another as the show progresses in a ingeniously woven manner, which eventually leads up to an ideal conclusion that the viewers have no choice to be dazzled by. Every single character is memorable, relatable, and just so damn realistically portrayed with each to their own humanistic feelings. All of them are entertaining to watch as they development and everyone has a moment of truth, where they shine more brightly than the other characters; no one character is like \"the overpowered great heroic guy\" or \"the primary evil psychopathic villain\". To name a few characters that had their own story, had a ton of screen-time, and were highly enjoyable to watch: Roy Mustang (Such a heroic, respectable character, one of best characters ever), Riza Hawkeye, King Bradley, Maes Hughes, Alex Louis Armstrong, Olivier Mira Armstrong, Izumi Curtis, Solf J Kimblee, Winry Rockbell, Scar and the most important character of the entire series (more important than Elric brothers), Van Hohenheim. Furthermore as I've mentioned before, Truth, Envy, Greed, Lust, and Gluttony are all actual formed characters. Their presentations represent all the ominous presences of our reality and how we overcome them. Revenge? Defeating a villain? What does that truly mean? Killing/Getting revenge on your enemy isn't the end of anything. A purpose is never all consuming; and in fact it'll probably make you even more lonely and unfortunate. That they went out on their own again, trying to stick to a promise they made to themselves, to not be helpless, that something that is so simple and grand is the true aim of their life, a life that all of us lead, is inspiring. Beautiful~ And the most amazing aspect of the show is truly Von Hohenheim's character. The ending of the anime is one of the most satisfying and sad/happy at the same time endings to any show ever. The moment we realize that Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood wasn't about mere alchemy, and action, but themes far beyond the interpretation of many viewers that teach us a lesson about life/reality. The moment we realize, that the story was truly about Von Hohenheim and his humanity.\nEverything about the art in this show is colorful, magical and fantastic. The art is designed by different people, so the animation in Brotherhood is different from the original; imo, Brotherhood's art is much much better. The superb quality for action/battles and alchemy portrayed: There's sword/hand-to-hand combat to guns/tanks to explosions/fire to shadow attacks to alchemy magic such as earth control. The characters were portrayed a little bit differently and uniquely as well, it's something you have to watch to notice (hard to explain). They especially did a wondrous job showing the various locales of Amestris, a country that absorbed many of its neighbors to reach its current state. The sound of the show? The Full Metal Alchemist series is known for it's great music, and FMAB doesn't disappoint; no, it impresses. The openings and endings of FMAB are the greatest I've ever heard. There are 5 openings to the show and they're all addicting and great. Opening 1- Again? Beautiful~ Opening 2 - Hologram? Great~ Opening 3 - Golden Time Lover? Catchy~ Opening 4 - Period? Epic~ Opening 5 - Rain? Sad/Satisfying end~ But the openings/endings aren't the only good thing, other great soundtracks that enhance the mood for specific scenes? Check (Listen to Brothers). Good voice cast? Check. \nFull Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is a literature masterpiece. Often in great literature pieces there are symbolic objects and characters (next paragraph), and the use of color symbolism. Black, Edward Elric wears a lot of it. Black usually represents death, and the dark aspect of one's nature--often one's own shadow. Ed wearing black represents his mourning for his dead mother, and his self-depression that is stemmed from dissolution and conflict/hardships. The darkness that precedes the spiritual light--reflection of death and destruction of old--rebirth into new/realization. Edward's hair color--yellow often represents the sun/divine light. In Islam it represents wisdom and happiness. But in some places such as Egypt, that color of yellow represents envy and disgrace. The color of yellow in FMAB often mixes together multiple cultures from the world--seen from the philosopher stone. The color green often is associated with life, hope, and happiness. However the portrayal of the color green is ironically used, for in FMAB people who are jealous and hateful towards others usually are associated with green. This may be far-fetched, but I believe that this symbolizes that in reality, with life, hope and happiness, follows death, jealousy, and hatred; one cannot exist without the other. And finally, the color of white: purity (obvious). The philosopher stone's shining of white towards the end marks the beginning of ascent from the abyss-darkness, purification of sins. \nFurthermore when I mentioned how FMAB has lots of symbolism and themes about life and reality, I truly meant it. The antagonist of FMAB's name is \"Father\" and he dresses entirely in white. He fulfills the role of an almighty and divine creator; he creates 7 homonculus' and names them: Wrath, Envy, Pride, Gluttony, Sloth, Greed, and Lust; the 7 deadly sins. He's supposed to represent Jesus/or a Godlike figure. Also, the marking held by each of the Homunculi are called ouroboros (picture of a circling serpent) that symbolize endless circle of life: birth, death, rebirth. Going back to the Jesus references, Von Hohenheim seeks \"Father\" at a church (duh...) and Hohenheim walks right over the water that's flooding the path (Jesus-Philosopher stone-Divine Being). But an even more symbolic scene representing the same concept was when \"Pride\" claims that \"God is only a figure created by humans; that's all there is to it. If you want to bring an iron hammer down on me, do it yourself without having to rely on God, human!\" Iron-hammer down? Ring any bells? Interestingly enough, King Bradley pins down Colonel Mustang, and he chooses to impale both of Mustang's palms (Jesus-crucification). And, my favorite: Flemel's Cross-- the one that Edward Elric has on his jacket and Al Elric has on his armor. Nicholas Flemel was the creator of this cross, and he was a devout christian that had spent his entire life studying the concept of \"alchemy\". The image of the Flemel's Cross is one where there's a serpent on the cross. There are multiple interpretations of this portrayal, but I think that it signifies the most obvious thing: crucification of a serpent (Satan). This most likely reflects the characters in FMAB overcoming the darkness of reality. All in all, probably the most important symbolism in FMAB was \"The Gate\" which was the connection between our reality, and the world of FMAB. The gate represents the phase of life, and the light illuminating from it represents spiritual growth (of all the characters). The gate closed when Elric lost his mother-- his loss of innocence. Then later once again the gate closed when ____ died in our own reality: a gateway that symbolizes problems with those that open it to see the other side, having no choice but to deal with whatever lies beyond it (temptation). Elric opening the gate to see the \"truth\". Elric's journey began because he opened that gate. \nGo watch the show now if you haven't already seen it. It is truly masterpiece that anybody, all ages, all genre preferences can enjoy. #1 rated in this site for a reason.\n        "},

I have seen quite some series with different genres, and I also have other favorite titles. But among all of those favorite titles of mine, FMA:B stands gallantly, as it was the only one with such intelligence and perfection I was completely at loss for words when finishing it.\nStory - The best part that shines the brightest in the series as whole. FMA:B, just like the manga, focuses on the Elric brothers as they embark upon a journey to get their\n          \n        original bodies back. Everything -- and by everything I mean from their backstories, the little arc, the wonderful climax and the satisfying conclusion -- is very well-thought, well-done. Everything about the alchemy thing and the (minor spoilers maybe) Homunculus thing, they completely blew my mind. The story was so brilliant and even though it started off with so many questions and so many confusions, the expanding story and the resolution answered them all for us. This story is what I would call, smart. It is complex, but not insane. The way we gradually understand the things happening inside the FMA:B universe is thanks to this anime's gratifying explanations. We are not too dumb to understand the story, and we aren't that smart to guess where the story is going either. All the ideas are very wonderful and magnificent. You don't usually find something this clever in an anime series...\nAs an additional note, I really loved the ending. It was totally 11 out of 10. No spoilers from me, though.\nArt - The art is cool as well. They are the usual Hiromu Arakawa style, not too detailed but pleasant to the eyes. I especially liked the alchemy effects and the symbols, they are super cool.\nSound - WELL WELL. I have the entire opening & ending songs. From again until Rain. From Uso until Ray of Shine. I have the entire anime soundtracks, composed by the brilliant Senju Akira, the three discs of magnificence. I listen to them over and over again. I have to tell you the sound is very diverse and beautiful. The voice actors and actresses are also brilliant. Romi Paku, oh gosh, you guys know how well she voices people. Ed is no exception. The sound effects, voice acting, BGMs, and opening-ending themes are all beautiful, what else to say man?\nCharacter - There are a lot of characters here. From our main characters to the enemies. The 'gray' characters as it was initially unclear where they belonged with. Suspicions and betrayals, enemies who turn allies. These characters are blessed with distinguishable characteristics and each one of them are unique. Even the characters who only appeared for little time can be very memorable to you (I'm talking about a certain character). There aren't any useless characters.\nEnjoyment - I TOTALLY enjoyed this show. It was astounding. Breathtakingly awesome. This is not the series you could marathon in a day as you will go insane... though I doubt you can wait for the next episode til the next day. The series is very smart, and though there are some tragedies, it's still sweet, beautiful, and heartwarming. The ending doe.\nOverall, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, as I had stated before and I will have to state it again now, is a perfect example on how a shounen series must be. Looking for a series with depth and complexity? The perfect series for you. Looking for some laughs? This series also have it, but don't blame me if you get caught up in this marvelous series, even though you didn't mean to.\nYou will get caught up anyway.\n        "},

It felt really rushed, and just didn't have the depth or emotional impact that the first anime had. And the animation is terrible!

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=18,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    This is the last anime that needs another review, but I couldn’t resist. The Fullmetal Alchemist franchise’s significance to anime is rivaled only by shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion and Cowboy Bebop. The original version from 2003 stands as one of my favourite series of all time, as it is one of the most well rounded shows that I’ve seen in the anime medium, and I believe it’s a must watch for all anime fans. \nFast forward to 2009, when Bones released Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, a faithful remake to the manga, which was still being written while the 2003 version was being released (which led\n          \n        to the overall plot diverging from the manga). Brotherhood has been critically acclaimed, and has often been considered superior to its 2003 counterpart. While I believe that it’s a fantastic show (and believe me – if the million fanboys/girls squealing isn’t enough, let me tell you that Brotherhood is AMAZING), and it does indeed do a few things better than the 2003 version, it does fall short in a few areas.\n(Note that comparisons to the 2003 version will be present, because hey, it’s inevitable.) \nPlot/Presentation\nSo Brotherhood follows the source material more faithfully. Does that automatically mean it’s better? Well, yes and no. One of the main criticisms against 2003 is that it diverged from the original plotline of the manga. While the original source material had some magnificent content, the mere fact that Brotherhood is more faithful doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s better. \nLet’s start with the flaws first. The first 10 or so episodes are extremely rushed, and, to be frank, shitty. Pivotal moments that build not only the foundation of the entire plot, but also key moments in the development for a few main characters, felt hurried, and I couldn’t feel the dramatic tension of the situations at all. \nI honestly hated Brotherhood at that point, but it eventually got better. The director eventually found a consistent pace that worked for the show. It was still fast paced and incredibly engaging, but it slowed down just enough for the show the flow naturally.\nThe main problem with the entirety of the show is the comedy. The manga had lots of comedy, and though I haven’t read all of the series, the comedy worked decently well to an extent. The show tries to copy the manga’s humour, and it just doesn’t work when brought to life on the screen. A lot of the tender and dramatic moments of the show are completely destroyed by characters suddenly jumping into chibi form for a quick laugh. The transitions between the drama and comedy in Brotherhood is horrendous and above all, inappropriate. Plus, the recurring jokes get way too old way too fast (e.g. people teasing Ed about his height is funny at first, but loses its effect). \nThe world of FMA can be rather… dark, and it’s beyond me why such inappropriate comedy is placed in the most out of place situations. Luckily, like my issue with the pacing, the humour eventually became a bit tamer, but it still irked me at times.\nRemember how I said that the mere fact that the show follows the manga more faithfully doesn’t mean that it’s better? \nThe 2003 version saw this, and it did its best to tone down the humour just enough for the show to feel more genuine. It still had the wacky FMA slapstick that everyone loves, but unlike Brotherhood, it was saved for when it wouldn’t interrupt with pivotal dramatic/emotional moments. \nHowever, it’s not to say Brotherhood does a bad job with its tender bits either. When it’s done right, it’s done well. \nNow before you rage on me and rate my review ‘not helpful’, keep in mind that I still gave this show an 8/10. This show has much redeeming value, hell, plenty of it. \nThe entirety of the story revolves around the theme of ‘Brotherhood’, like the title suggests. You see this with both the protagonists and the antagonists. You see this bond with the Elric brothers, the military, with Fort Briggs, and even with the homunculi. \nThe plot itself, while having some issues with its presentation, has the word ‘epic’ written all over it. The world of FMA is a grand one, and so are the rules of alchemy, which is what makes this show special in the fantasy genre. Alchemy is not magic – to obtain, one must give something of equal value (The Law of Equivalent Exchange). There are many rules of alchemy, and as the show progresses, you learn more about alchemy itself and its effect on other people, both positively and negatively. \nThis is one of the most daring shows I’ve seen in any medium ever, as it goes beyond what the fantasy genre is usually capable of. Brotherhood has a monster of a plot, and somehow it manages to handle its many plot threads with care without seeming convoluted. Each and every subplot receives closure (for the most part) and they all have their impact on the story at large. This is hands down the best part about and so this show deserves praise for that.\nOverall, the plot has it all. It’s complex, fascinating, fun, and engaging. Unfortunately, the few but major flaws took a toll on my rating. \nCharacters\nFor me, what I love most about the world of FMA is the characters. The story begins with the tragic tale of the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse, two of my favourite characters in anime.  \nEdward is the daring brother, the taker of chances, and the intuitive genius of alchemy for his age. He’s strong, he’s flawed, and he is the famous Fullmetal Alchemist. Alphonse is the one who stops and thinks, and throughout the story, he wishes to prove his worth and be more useful to everyone. He can be considered as the moral compass in the entire cast. What I absolutely adore about their relationship is how much they want to save each other before themselves. Edward has lost an arm and a leg, and Alphonse has lost his entire body and is forced to live in a suit of armour, yet all they care about is each other. You can’t ask for better leads like these two. They develop and flesh out nicely as the story goes on. Few relationships can be so tragic, beautiful, and touching. \nBrotherhood has a huge cast of side characters, and somehow manages to give the majority of them enough screentime for each of them to leave an impact on me. All the characters have their own motives, relationships, and place in the story at large, and you get to see it all. \nCertain characters’ roles and relationships were enlarged in Brotherhood, making their presence far more significant then in the 2003 version. For example, Winry is not only bigger a character in Brotherhood, but her relationship with Edward in particular is far more fleshed out. Winry keeps him grounded. You see her take care of his injuries, scold him, tease him, and most importantly, fall in love with him. \nI could go on and on about the characters, but I’ll let you learn about them yourselves. Overall, Brotherhood has a memorable, fantastic, and well used cast\nArt/Animation\nBones, you beast of a studio. It’s a wonder how consistent the animation is from Episode 1 to 64. Most long running anime tend to lose its steam when it comes to production values as the show goes on. \nNot Brotherhood. \nWhile the animation is not always perfect, it’s still crisp, clear, and consistent. Considering the show’s length, its consistency is an achievement in itself. Equal time and care is also put in the character designs. All of the characters are definable, vivid, and full of life. The background scenery can be absolutely stunning to boot. \nThe fight scenes range from boring to extremely mind blowing (particularly fights involving Mustang and the final showdown). However, FMA was never about the action, so I can’t really complain, as I feel that it would’ve let the show down if it were more action-oriented. \nThe only complaint I have, albeit a minor one, is the use of lighting. It can seem a bit flat at times, but overall, this show is very visually pleasing to the eye.\nMusic/Voice Acting\nWhen it comes to the music, the openings and endings are where Brotherhood shines. I’ve yet to see OP’s and ED’s so memorable, gripping, and energetic. I loved each and every one of them except for the 3rd OP and ED. Even though I don’t usually listen to Japanese music, I loved the songs. Plus, when the songs are also used as inserts during any given episode, it brings the biggest smile to my face. Standouts go to OP 1 and 4 and ED 2, which is a touching pop ballad called ‘Let it Out’. Even though I couldn’t understand the lyrics without translation, it still brought a few tears to my eyes.\nThe soundtrack itself is very solid one. There is a wide range in this soundtrack, from upbeat to suspenseful, and the soundtrack is used well. I’ve no complaints. \nFMA has been considered to be among the shows that have superior dubs than most in anime, and honestly, I could see why. There isn’t a single miscast here, and every one of the VA’s played their role amazingly well. For example, I was a little hesitant to hear that Alphonse’s VA was replaced, but all that hesitation withered away after I heard Maxey Whitehead’s portrayal of him. Her performance came of just as genuine as Aaron Dismuke’s.\nIt’s hard to pick out standouts, mainly because every VA went beyond the call of duty with these characters. I loved this dub that much. \nConclusion\nAfter a rather disappointing start, Brotherhood more than makes up for it, as it becomes a huge rollercoaster ride until its epic finale and touching conclusion. With a plot that screams epic, fantastic characters, masterful production values, and an eargasmic dub, I wish I could rate this show higher. I really do. However, the few flaws were unfortunately major ones, and they took a huge toll on the show as a whole. Consistent pacing and tone are two important building blocks that form a solid story, and unfortunately Brotherhood lacks in both areas. Nevertheless, don’t let these flaws stop you from watching this show, as it more than makes up for it. If you haven’t watched anything from the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise, I suggest watching the 2003 version first and then watching Brotherhood. \nNow before I close the longest review I’ve ever written, I’d like to address one commonly asked question in the anime community: is Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood worthy enough to be ranked #1 on MAL? While I do not believe Brotherhood is THE BEST ANIME EVER, I will say it’s among the greats, and its universal appeal is undeniable. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood captures what anime is and the great heights of which this medium is capable of. I couldn’t think of another show that is more worthy than Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to be the face of anime.  \nNow, me being a FMA fanboy, this gigantic review only scrapes the surface of all my thoughts and feelings. Am I being overly positive? Am I being unfair? If you want to take this discussion further, feel free to leave feedback/comments on my profile! This is StillSwingin007, and thanks for reading my review!"},

Then came Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. I was recommended this series in March 2015 by a friend, but it didn’t get around to it until May 2016, and I’ll be honest, I’m starting to kick myself for not getting onto this series earlier.\nI’ll try not to spoil too much for you guys who haven’t watched this yet, and bear in mind, I’ve never read the manga, so Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was the\n          \n        first time I was exposed to this solid story. Two brothers, Ed and Al Elric on a mission to get their mum back through the use of alchemic powers, but then sh*t happens; one loses their body, the other an arm and a leg. They end up uncovering all sorts of mysteries going down in their country, Amestris. That’s all I can say on the matter without spoiling it, but expect a lot of action, bloodshed and conspiracy.\nI gotta hand it to Hiromu Arakawa for this story and the way the anime writing team adapted it in the series; It flowed almost seamlessly as if the viewers were being exposed to real-time events taking place in the world, and among all of the action and countless loss of lives, it felt pretty realistic. That’s right, not keeping characters on to do justice to fans, the unexpected turn of events in the story, and a very clear and believable issue of life and humans being portrayed. There were also some light-hearted elements to ensure you weren’t too depressed from watching this, and I thought witty banter, unexpected jokes and sarcasm added to the overall value of the show. I lost count of the amount of times the episodes in this series left me thinking “holy sh*t”, “Why him/her” or “god, that was amazing”, or even make me laugh a bit. \nAs a writer, I was impressed to see the vast amount out characters in this show, but also on top of that, each character was given just the right amount of exposure for you to cling on to them. I hate to compare, but thinking about some of the mediocre cartoons I watched when I was a kid, many secondary characters in some series don’t get a lot of possible on-screen time, and writers could have used them to an advantage to the overall story they were telling, and the writing team for Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood did just that; for that, well done.\nIn terms of animation, Bones anime studio did a fantastic job on the this, from the realistic set designs and well-drawn characters, to the epic alchemic action scenes and transformation sequences. I’m familiar with the anime studio’s recent works, Akagami no Shirayukihime (Snow White with the Red Hair), which they did a good job on the setting, but I would admit it was not as great as the effort they put into increasing the believe factor of the viewers for this series’ animation.\nAkira Senju did incredibly well with the soundtrack for this series and deserves every bit of praise for it. The music made every bit of this anime more immersive, and even though you may hear some of the songs again (as expected for anime), no matter how classical it is, I bet you will end up singing along with it. I’m not a fan of classical music, but for this soundtrack, I surely enjoyed every piece.\nSub or Dub? I watched the FUNimation dub to this series. I’m not a sub watcher, and I’ve heard a lot from a few anime fans discouraging dubs in general. However, watching the dubbed version of this, who can argue the fact that the voice acting is just golden? Vic Mignogna and Maxey Whitehead did an absolutely stellar job on portraying Ed and Al Elric, along with many of the well-known names in the dubbing business: Ed Baylock, Colleen Clinkenbeard, J Michael Tatum, Todd Haberkorn, Travis Willingham and Chris Sabat, to name just a few, absolutely smashed it. So many of the greatest voice actors were put on the characters to bring each character to life the proper way, and I’ve got to thank FUNimation for their efforts.\nWhile I have praised this series, it does come with its slight downsides. Earlier I did mention there was some light-heated jokes that were injected into the series, but I personally felt the timing of the jokes in some episodes took away from the overall seriousness of the story at hand, which really did affect my standpoint on whether the matter of Ed and Al fighting to get their limbs and bodies back was a serious one, or one where it was preferable, but not important.\nAnother thing I can’t help but criticise was the way some character emotions were portrayed in the show. In my opinion, I do think that some character emotions, such as anger, shyness and agitation, were over-exaggerated unnecessarily in the animation. I do get that this might have been done to conform with the style of anime and may have been an added value to the light-heatedness of the series, but this was something I wasn’t too jolly about, and maybe could have been toned down a little to make sure the story isn’t taken for granted.\nTo conclude, I’ll say this: as any other fan guy would say, “there should be more”, which may be want I want from an anime of this calibre, deep down I truly believe this anime is one of those series that is best left as it is: nothing more, nothing less. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is, without a doubt, a well-told, captivating and brilliant anime series, that every action-craver, whether you’re into anime or not, should at least make the effort to watch."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Well, there has been a huge war deciding which is better: FMA or FMA Brotherhood? What is my opinion? You will find at the end of this review. But for now, lets bring this review back to life with alche-OH MY GOD!!!\nStory (10/10) Much better paced than the original. Very unique story. But the story here is based entirely off of the manga. Which means NO FILLER!!! YAAAY!!! Don't watch Naruto, Bleach, One Piece or anything like that. Watch this instead. Its MUCH better. The first 13 episodes might go very slowly for watchers of the original series, but after that, it picks up, and\n          \n        starts driving. And the ride sure is a long and fun one.\nArt (10/10) Its breathtaking. There is so much detail put in, but the action scenes look SPECTACULAR! I mean, this came out in 2009/2010. 7 years ago. And it looks better than most shows that come out today.\nSound (10/10) The soundtrack is very good, the openings are all great (except for opening 2, not my favorite) and the ending themes are surprisingly all great. But the best part is the voice acting. Especially in the dub. The voices are just perfect for each character. This proves that Funimation is the best English dubbing company out there. \nCharacters (11/10) Incredible. Without a doubt, the characters are what make the Fullmetal Alchemist series so special. Especially in Brotherhood. Every character is useful in some way. Almost every character develops. Even Greed. EVEN FREAKING GREED! The one character I hated from FMA 2003, I love him in brotherhood. He actually DEVELOPS A PERSONALITY!!!! Just.....mind blown. \nEnjoyment (9.5/10) Well for watchers of the original FMA, the first 13 episodes will go by very slowly. But after that, the series is a MASTERPIECE. YOU WILL ENJOY THE CRAP OUT OF IT. I PROMISE YOU. IN FACT, STOP READING THIS REVIEW. GO WATCH IT RIGHT NOW!!! RIGH-\nPros: \n+The story is excellently done.\n+The animation is incredibly fluid and nice.\n+Great voice acting!!!!!!! AMAZING ENGLISH DUB!!!!\n+Outstanding characters\n+The Opening and Ending themes.\n+You always want more\n+The ending will make you cry.\nCons:\n-Slow start\nNeutral: You may have to watch the original FMA before Brotherhood to understand certain things better\nSo if I had to choose between FMA 2003 and Brotherhood, the winner is: Both. They are both just as good as each other. But I recommend you watch the original first, because if you watch Brotherhood first, you wont be able to enjoy the original as much.\nOverall: 9.8\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I can understand the conflict between how Fullmetal Alchemist and FMA Brotherhood in which they differ. However, although there may be a different opinion among those who have taken the time to watch both of the series, but I personally believe that enrichment in the FMAB series of 64 episodes is superior to the older dramatized FMA series. In my full understanding I can say that my opinion won't change for the simple fact I have enjoyed watching Brotherhood twice over with subtitles and once again in dubbed version for a full story in mind. All in all, the basis of the show is in\n          \n        my interest to place it in the highest respect towards rating. \nIndeed this series does have a repetition in its theoretical story and action, but the character life seems all too real. This show definitely is my favorite at this point, but even in that light, I still have just one issue. Characters take quick risks and life changing actions for emotions of past beloved people or wish it so, but never do they feel to me that they are attached until the rap up of the story. So if you are for swift feels, then you should realize that you need to complete the entirety of the story. \nAnd of course besides the fact, you should indefinitely take the time to watch this series just for an amazing series sake. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Well, I finished this anime awhile ago, and I was looking through the reviews and I was actually surprised that some people rated it a 5 or below. (obviously not many people did, but still) So I decided to write a review for this(:\nLet me start off saying, I did not read the manga except the very last vol after completing both series. With that said, I did watch the original made back in 2003. I was IN LOVE with it. I loved the ending and I just thought it had so much depth. But I was well aware that Brotherhood was the remake to\n          \n        better fit the manga, so I decided to watch it afterwards.\nNow, since I really loved the first one, I was very hesitant to watch the remake. And for those who watched the original, the first 12 or so episodes is pretty much the exact same beginning of FMA. And it was a little annoying just trying get past that, but I did watch it just in case there was a plot difference. I will say, the first episode of FMA:B is pretty much irrelevant to the entire plot. It's pretty much just a \"get the feel of the characters\" episode. But once I hit episode 13, that's where everything got very interesting. \nStory: 10- This anime had so much depth and emotion, that I found myself crying so hard in one episode & then laughing my butt off in the next episode. I will say, this is a dark tale of two brothers trying to restore their bodies. The plot twists that take place is just beautiful. The ending will leave you breathless. I think this anime is perfect for anyone. It has humor, action, suspense, tragedy, and a hint of romance(: Only real downfall was the beginning; I feel as if everything went a lil too fast. And in which one of the character dies (won't say which one) it's not as emotional because of the faster pace and the viewer couldn't get as attached. Only complaint about the plot! \nArt: 10- I will admit this anime doesn't have 100% outstanding animation compared some anime of their time or newer ones from today. FMA:B was done in 2009. With that being mentioned, it was fairly decent for when it came out and it's better than its original. Everything has a deep tone yet a delightful brightness. It's admirable. This is a somber toned anime and the animation reflect that~!\nSound: 10- Some of my favorite Openings & Endings come from this anime. They tell their own little story based on the storyline itself. Not to mention the animation for the EDs & OPs is head-on with the songs! The music they even play throughout the show is just flawless. You'll find yourself loving everything about the soundtracks that they play.\nCharacters: 10- The development is just perfect. If you're like me, you'll actually find yourself liking and even growing attached to some the deadly sins(: (They are the bad guys in the anime in case you're new to this anime) They don't over-analyze too much on a particular one, but just enough to make them either relate-able, hated, or lovable. If you've seen the original, you need to just have an open mind with a new take on the characters. Edward's dad would be one of them along  with Scar. I also really love how they introduced new characters that weren't in the original. Also, the females in this anime are strong and can hold their own, which as a young women like myself, I can really appreciate. Personally, my fav characters will always by Greed, Alphonse, Roy, & Winry. Who's yours? :3\nEnjoyment: 10- This is my favorite anime of all time and nothing has change my mind about that. It's actually funny, my friend even gave me a list of anime to watch and said \"this will surely think differently.\" And y'know? They didn't(: This is one of the few animes where it left me stunned. Brotherhood made me cry, laugh, cry some more, laugh even harder, and left me in suspense. This is an anime that will touch your heart & never leave! \nOverall: 10- I enjoyed it 100% Except maybe the beginning, but I promise all of you that it is worth it. The amount of episodes tends to put people off, but it IS WORTH ALL YOUR TIME. This anime is beautiful. And I want all of you to know that this anime isn't just ranked #1 on this site because it's well known. It is because over 100,000 people all over the world rated this anime a perfect 10. ^.^\nI do recommend watching the original first just to compare the two! \nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a masterpiece.   \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="                          \n    Fullmetal Alchemist is an action, comedy, romance and drama. The anime is Kingdom Hearts 2, Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core and Bioshock Infinite put together, if you want to know why, I suggest you play or watch the games. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the anime that people can understand the story more and the plot; it is a better adaption to the manga. In this anime many support characters die, I mean a many. This anime is awesome; I enjoyed every minute of it, the sadness, the drama and the funny moments. I assure you to watch this anime; it is worth your time. If\n          \n        you are interested into anime that have action in them, this is perfect for you.\nStory\nStory is awesome, the “Elric brothers” Al and Edward are on a quest to find their bodies because they lost it because they were trying to resurrect their mother, which was clearly impossible to do and they would punish for it. The story is set in 1914 even though people wear clothes that were in the modern day in 2000s. Edward lost his arm and his leg and Al lost his entire body and his soul was put into a metal armour. Later on the “Elric brothers” gets help from the military, their teacher, the emperor’s son and the lady mechanic Winry. So Edward and Al started to train for their journey because they will fight tough enemies, I mean tough. To be honest I like how they wrote this story into a well ordered fashion and you can feel the emotion and tremor in this anime, and the epic battles. To be honest I have never witness a weak character at all or terrible dialogues, thank god for that or this anime would have gotten a little lower rating. But the bad thing about it is how predictable the story was. You can tell that something was bad to happen to the characters, for example if you see a happy moment between somebody, something bad happens to them. Can you believe they made 64 episodes! OMG 64! I thought it was going to be those anime that had a maximum of 25 episodes, there are no fillers.\nSound/Art\nIn my opinion the character design sucks, the people in the anime look like characters from the 1990s, I mean look at the characters! To be honest, the characters look chibi and you comparing a three year old to a 35 year-old man there’s no fucking differences! But the art was nice and the animation was fluid, the environment look beautiful and the fights do not look like Naruto Shippuden that the animation sucks balls when they are fighting. Sound there are not much songs in the anime to be honest, I heard about ten which was depressing. Voice acting was great even in the English Dub, but think about this. Hellsing Ultimate’s voice acting of the English Dub was fucking terrible, we all know that, but when compared it to Fullmetal Alchemist, is like comparing the game Last of Us to the game Ride to Hell: Retribution.\nCharacters\nThere are no weak or terrible character roles in this anime but I knew that the characters that were going to die, it was very predictable. Edward is a short little guy that can be very hot tempered and he can be very funny at times, overall he is a very good older brother to Al and he tries his best to protect him. Al his not so as “cool” brother, deeply cares for Edward and he wants to get body back as much as Edward. Winry is a love interest to Edward, she was friends with him since they were little and cares for him as well. Roy Mustang is one of my favourite characters in the anime because he is badass. He has fire power which cannot work when it is raining, “physics.” He partners with his lover Hawkeye which has no ability but she an excellent marksman, even though she is so serious and yet her character design is so unserious. The bad guys in this anime are pretty cool because they are not those bad guys that are just bad for no explanation, they do very evil stuff. The main antagonist Father aka “The bearded bastard” he is like a Xemnas from Kingdom Hearts, he wants the power of God and he is required to sacrifice souls to do that. The bad guys you will hate them because how evil they are, well no shit there the bad guys. I thought the characters were great and the makers put a lot of effort on them. \nEnjoyment\nThe fight scenes are awesome, they have characters using strategies to find ways to beat their opponent and they have to go through a pretty bloody battle and crazy bloodshed. There was important conversation that made me understand the story more. The characters are pretty amazing. I enjoy almost every bit of the anime, but some points of it was shallow, a bit boring causing me to skip some episodes. I like the characters they keep the show going and make it less boring and dull. The funny moments are hilarious and they will make you laugh. Edward becomes depress and angry when people call him short, but he grows in many episodes later. I love the enjoyment in the anime.\nFinal Score\nAn 9 (Awesome)\nThe reason I put a 9 because it had bad things to it. I thought it was better than the original because it had a better adaptation. They weren't enough songs to the anime and I wish they made the characters look less chibi. Some points of the story were predictable but I did love it.  I give praise to the creators for making an awesome anime. I recommend you watch this anime, thank god that they made it. I can’t give 10 out of 10 because no anime is perfect; every anime has a bad point. "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I once used to be an anti-weeb. I thought those who watched anime and read manga were weird, geeky, puerile. Why? I thought anime was a bunch of cartoon girls with really big eyes with lots of animated punctuation marks and Japanese. I was mature, normal, and did not watch that kind of stuff.\nThis was the first anime I watched. Why? I thought that if I were to see only one anime series, I would see the best, so I looked at multiple websites and videos and determined that FMAB was the best. And of the ones I've seen so far to completion, it is\n          \n        the best. Not necessarily my favorite, but the best.\nIt was so good that I wanted more, which is why I still watch anime today. But let me explain why this anime is so majestic, why I get a certain ineffable feeling of awe when listening to the soundtrack or seeing the OP/ED videos again.\nSTORY. You can read the summary. Sounds interesting, right? Then watch it. 64 episodes, zero filler, of one connected flawless story revolving around the equivalence of alchemy and its consequences. A masterful paradigm of the first type of anime plot, that is, protagonist vs. antagonist. Equally grim and bright at times, the story soars along towards the ending which is one of the best endings in anime I've seen so far.\nART. Bones may not be my favorite studio, but it certainly evokes the flavor of the story. From the way Edward's eyes expand when he encounters something horrific to the way the brothers turn into jelly next to their teacher to the fire and cadavers and occult gore associated with the evil in this story, the art is done masterfully. Perfect depiction.\nSOUND. Akira Senju's style harks back to classical, with substantial use of the deeper strings and percussion. The entire soundtrack can be seen as one grand symphony, with Senju as its composer and conductor. May be a bit repetitive at times, but hey, similar themes reappear, similar types of events, and with 64 episodes one would be hard-pressed to compose unique tunes for every single event that necessitates music. He definitely has a distinctive tone and mark to his music -- you can tell immediately when listening to various anime soundtracks when FMAB OST comes up.\nCHARACTER. Edward Elric, the protagonist, is one of my favorite characters of anime. In the entire cast for FMAB, the fact that I like him the best just comes to show how awesome of a main character he is. His determination to do good against overwhelming evil and fight for what he believes in is a high standard. But besides Edward, the supporting cast is just magnificent. The loyal brother Alphonse Elric, the stoic King Bradley, the caring Winry Rockbell, the strong yet gentle Alex Louis Armstrong, and many, many others. In fact, the quality of the English dub for this anime (which I saw) just comes to show how good of an anime this is, to merit so many aptly chosen voice actors. And of course, there's plenty of fighting, which is something I look for in anime and probably what you, dear reader, do too (if you've read this far).\nENJOYMENT. What can I say? I stayed up late every night to finish this in a week. It's that good. This is one of those anime that when watching it you know, you just feel it, that it is of superb quality.\nThis anime is certainly not childish, weird, or immature. It is quite mature. If you're already a \"weeb,\" then you probably watched this, if not, then I can't understand why you haven't. If you're wading into the wonderful waters of anime for the first time, then be my guest and watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\nOne word to describe this anime: awesome\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    ✨ may contain spoilers ✨\nI remember the first time I watched Fullmetal Alchemist (2003), when I was 14 years old. At that time, all I wanted was to have fun and nothing else could give me that if not a shounen-style anime. And, this year, I decided to watch Brotherhood. Initially, given the recommendations along with my past experiences with the series, I was hoping for a good entertainment. But I gained much more than that. I gained entertainment with a good story envolving great characters, whose meanings could teach me so many things that it's even hard to write a review about all that.\n          \n\nStarting off with the Elric Brothers, even though their story is tragic, it could bring me such an amazing touch of inspiration. It's so pleasant to see that the main hero of this journey has some issues that normally are seen as fragile: he doesn't have an arm, and he doesn't have a leg. This one fact can bring us an enormous representativity to the public. Daily we are told that we are not capable, and many times we end up believing in that, searching for ways to accept that maybe the odds are not in our favour. Witnessing a hero that takes all that \"fragility\" that society imposes and turns it into determination is... wonderful. Just with that, Edward Elric gets something we rarely see in any form of media: a role of a hero that represents minority through disability. Even though it's too common to see many main characters with a dark past (containing bullying, or familiar losses), there were never a better way to represent a \"different minority\" like it's shown here. \nAbove that, the goals that the Elric Brothers aim for are something I see as original in a series. That's because he never tries or wants to be the best in the world, like we see in so many synopses. It's something more particular, and deeper: recovering his own body (and his brother's as well). Getting rid of that disability, even if he has to learn to use it to get there. Nevertheless, they always find impossibilities along the whole journey, and even so, they look for another way to get what they want.\nThe Philosopher's Stone, using the words from the anime itself to describe it: \"those who possess it, are no longer bound by the laws of equivalent exchange in alchemy, can gain without sacrifice... create without equal exchange.\" In other words, it's like a genie in a bottle that can get your wishes come true. With that, this item they determinately seek is the main key so they can conquer what they long for. The only thing left for them to get their bodies back without sacrificing anything else. Of course, if it gets in the wrong hands, it could get pretty messed up (and it does).\nAt first, knowing about the Stone, I got to think what I would wish for if I knew I could get it. What would I do with this Stone, and alchemy? But as the story goes, and the fails and losses and upsets come to meet our heroes... another question popped inside my head: what would I wish for even if I knew that the odds are against me, even if I knew that I probably would not get it? That one question could make me get a self-awareness of what are my real wishes in life. What I will ever aim for, even if I lose. For what I will stand up for, even if I fall. Well, that's what they do. They get up and move on, even if all the doors are locked. They always find a path. If there's no door, they make one. That's the beauty this brotherhood shows us. \nNot so different, all the other characters from the anime gets to have an amazing meaninfulness and representativity. I can say for sure that all of them are very well explored sometime along within the 64 episodes. And that satisfies me. But taking into account that this anime surpassed all I was expecting for, they were not only explored but they meant a lot as well. Like the villains representing the seven deadly sins. Or those who symbolized the military forces of a nation. Or the rebellious and unsatisfied people against an unjust government who's trying to destroy them. All of that could give us a very nice plot of a country's power struggle.\nThat's the point I assume it's the most interesting, and that's where the plot gets so close to our reality, as it turns as something current. Bringing up serious issues about how a government can manipulate the media in its favour, how they are able to destroy people because of their ethnicity (like it happens with the Ishvalians), and how they can create a prejudice and segregation against people. All that, unfortunaly, is real. All it takes us is to watch the news and we'll see numerous cases of injustice in America and the rest of the world. People dying in the hands of war and injustice is extremely common, and realizing those many attacks envolves military forces... it's frightful. These cases happen for so long, and ignore them is not an option, mainly because we don't know if we're going to be tomorrow's victims. RIP Orlando. \nArt has a giant power to aware, inform, entertain and, above all, to create a refuge for its maker: the artist. I wonder if the author wanted to register her uneasiness about these matters through the story. But even if she had no intent of doing it, art is an open field for interpretation. Everybody gets a different idea from these tales, and here's mine: Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood creates a big criticism towards a government we are so used to see taking absurd actions throughout the world. It creates a big criticism towards how a nation is commanded, towards how the military forces and the media are manipulated in favor of prejudice, like the unfair death of thousands and thousands.\nIt's interesting to see how the homunculus are being shown as well, given the fact that each one represents one of the seven deadly sins. Observation: greed is the only one that could head in a good direction, in some moments. Watching this series with full consciousness of what are the true roles of the characters, whether good or bad, and what it represents in real life... that was an experience that taught me many things. But that's something I'll keep for myself.\nSpecial note for some episodes where they discuss the theory of alchemy: one is all and all is one. Those speeches are so beautiful and full of content about humanity and environment, that it made me sad to realize how distant we are from this kind of consciousness. But getting close to it now was gratifying. \n...Gratifying. All I can say this series caused me was: gratitude. An infinite gratitude fills me up after getting so many good things from those 64 episodes. So many life lessons now go along with me, and makes me better. Equal Change: I gave my time to watch all of this, and gained such a knowledge.\nI'll register this love letter here as an expression of my feelings after watching this anime which I highly recommend for everyone: the story, the characters, the development, the enjoyment and the meaning I found in this journey. And for the sake of a good review: the sound and art are worth it as well!\nThat's it. I hope this anime touches other hearts as it has touched mine. And may everyone find an inner meaning for what it represents. \nThanks, Hiromu Arakawa! 💕\n        "},

The anime may have stuck to the manga, but that does not make it the best, nor does it influence my rating drastically. \nThe characters were likable and the art and sound very good as well as effective in conveying the atmosphere in the anime. However, I found the story to be a bit lackluster. By the time I reached episode 50, I was beginning to\n          \n        lose interest because the story did not keep me on the edge of my seat and wanting to find out what happened next, which they executed extremely well in the early episodes. \nThe only thing in this anime that I could see being #1 on any list would be it's final OP. It was extremely well-crafted and encompasses the entire story, neglecting to leave anything out. It was easily one of my favorite OPs of all time.\nOverall, I recommend this anime, but only to people who are starting to delve deeper into the world of anime. \n"},

I never reviewed it because I thought everyone already knew about it and watched it. What spurred me to write this review is the fact that Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood has lost its seat in first place to an anime movie that came out this year, Kimi no na wa...\nWhy?\nIt hasn't even been out for a year and yet it beats FMAB and many other fantastic shows. I just don't understand. I watched it and liked it and gave it an 8. It doesn't deserve first place. FMAB does,\n          \n        and here's why.\nIf I could name every little detail that makes this anime shine, I would, but no one has time for that and neither do I so I'll just talk about the details a little. I've watched this show at least a dozen times in the past 4 years. Probably more. I never get sick of it. How is that possible? Because this show has everything. It does nothing wrong. \nEd's design. Long golden hair braided down the back. Golden eyes. Angry expression. Red jacket. Gloves. Automail arm and leg. Boots. He stands out. He doesn't look silly but he doesn't look normal either. It's a unique design that reflects his personality perfectly. As for his personality, he is a very well-developed character. He's also my favorite anime character of all time.\nThe enemies. They themselves are likable. They feel like they have a purpose other than to get in the way of the protagonist and they go through character development as well. Also, they're strong and aren't defeated with \"the power of friendship.\" \nThe beginning (excluding the filler first episode) sucked me in immediately, personally. It's tragic but the tragedy is what drew me in. It tells you what you need to know, grabs your attention, and then shoves you off. It seamlessly moves you through the story and every decision the characters make or everywhere they decide to go makes sense.\nThe soundtrack is great. I've downloaded about half of it (my favorite songs from the OST) and listened to the songs over and over again. I never get tried of hearing them. The openings and endings are great too.\nThe art is great. I don't know what else to say here. I just wouldn't have it any other way.\nThe plot is of course amazing. I always think about how the author managed to come up with something so amazing. My goal is to mirror her skills somehow with my own writing.\nIt's a complete story. No need to read the manga. It has a fantastic ending. Everything you want to happen, happens. It also teaches a very powerful lesson.\nAnother biased opinion to add to this review, but I've always watched the anime subbed and I love Ed's voice actor. Envy's too.\nAlchemy is cool and Ed is a master at it. Even though he is already good at alchemy (and thus doesn't get any better at it), this isn't a detriment to the show. While his alchemy skills don't necessarily develop, Ed does and what he decides to do with those skills changes based on his development.\nThis review is just all over the place. I don't know what else to say. If this isn't your thing that's fine. But according to my opinion, FMAB is a masterpiece.\n        "},

Such as 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' and 'Cowboy Bebop'. These series floored me on their story, characters and overall tone, But none like this series. This series is of course is Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\nEverything to the characters, animation and style of the series it is all handled with such excellent directing which is why I love it. Lets start with the characters.  Each character in this anime is essential to the anime. Not once did I not enjoy a characters presence in a anime series.

The animation for this series for this series is done by 'Bones' and is solid. Everything to the back-drops, character design and of course the mouth watering fight scenes. These fights were so fluent that they oozed  of the screen with awesome-ness.\nIf you are an anime fan, I implore you to watch this anime. You can also watch the original because it is also excellent.

Yes I know people believe it is because of how well it followed the manga,  but if i wanted the manga i'd read that.    The biggest difference between FMA and brotherhood is how the story is told.  FMA we are told nearly the whole story from the perspective\n          \n        of the two brothers, it was their take on the world.   it allowed you to become emotionally invested in them and their fight.  Brotherhood's story however, seemed to be told from the world perspective following all characters seeming equal amount of times.   This doesn't allow the level of connection and investment in the characters that came from the original that made me fall in love with it and anime.\nPOTENTIAL SPOILERS \nThe main example, and the biggest, is when they are taken in by the father and befriend the little girl.  In FMA this is one of the saddest things in any anime i've witness, ever.   it still brings tears to my eyes.  In Brotherhood, their time with the family happens over maybe an episode and those connections that FMA had developed where never able to take hold.

But after waiting some days to give it a score I realized many things were terrible.\nLet's talk about the story, and I'll be frank with this one, it has got many inconsistencies. It could have ended in 13 episodes, but it's an adaptation from the manga, so I can understand the length, but due to its length it has a lot of problems. Creating this story, they are telling us the travel that the Elric brothers are doing to recover their bodies. But instead of doing just that, and explaining what really happened\n          \n        to them, they, they start telling things about the world. At this point it's fine, but when the puzzle starts fitting, it breaks itself.\nThe series always proposes new problems without fixing the old ones, and at the end, there are still many things that have been unexplained, and from someone who loves explanations, I hated that so much. There's a lot of lore, but it seems not to be complete. But overall the story is quite enjoyable.\nThe art is also quite good, at the starts of the series everybody looks different, they have different \"powers\" and personalities. But while the series is advancing, they look the same in the exterior, and only a few characters have evolved, another problem. But let's focus on the art and say that some fights are truly amazing, but sadly the best fights are in the openings, some are long but boring, and others are intense but have pauses. Everything wrong but in some.\nThe sound is quite good, I loved the songs and the openings and endings are brilliant, but the OST is super repetitive, you can hear the same song twice the same episode during 10 episodes. At the end I end burnt of the songs. I usually listen to the OST when I finish a series or a videogame, but it was impossible for me to hear the FMAB one.\nCharacter base is good. I'm not joking, they all start very well, but at the end of the series only some of them have evolved. Evolving your characters while they are traveling is something that if you don't do, then your characters are going to end very poorly. And this happened in FMAB, only some characters like Roy Mustang, Scar or Alfred feel different at the end. And from me, coming with a series which has one of the best evolutions for its characters ever (ATLA), it hurt.\nBut I didn't realize about all this until I finished the series, I literally watched it in 3 days, that's like 20 chapters per day. It was very enjoyable and always there was something interesting happening (I mean interesting to watch not referring to the story). Even though the rhythm in the fights is not very good, the fights are quite enjoyable since the \"heroes\" are less powerful than the \"villains\".\nOverall I found that FMAB is a big show, not bad, but not as good as the myanimelist community thinks it is.\nSorry for my english, not my main language. And if you considered my review short, I encourage you to add me to Discord or some shit like that to discuss about it!! :*"},

I heard quite a few good things about the show since it was released and so I finally decided to watch it.\nAfter the first episode, I was hooked. This isn't your traditional anime. It is more like poetry. From the first episode, I pretty much knew that I wouldn't regret spending my time with this show. Little did I know, it was much more than that.\nAs the show progressed I realized that it wasn't simply a teenage drama/comedy, it delved into some really emotional themes, especially in\n          \n        the second season. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood pulls at your heart at every chance it gets and when you're down and you think you can't take any more it kicks you again.\nThe animation style was beautiful as well, it gave a euphoric feel to the entire show. The character design was rather bland but being a spin-off of Fullmetal Alchemist the character design was spot on. The thing that annoyed a little bit was that there were a lot of characters and it took a while to learn who was who.\nFullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood has had a weird emotional impact, one that I can't really explain. All that I can say is that it was beautiful, emotional experience. It was poetry. It wasn't simply another good anime, it was in a league of its own.\nI highly recommend that you watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood but be prepared to feel emotions you have never felt with any other anime before.﻿\n        "},

The things that makes FMA:B stand out compared to other anime is that it does EVERYTHING excellently. The pacing is amazing. The art style is clean, appealing, and overall great. There are definitely shows with flashier animation and more intricate detail, but FMA:B has so much detail in what it provides that more would be unnecessary. The character development and plot advancement(pacing) is perfect.

So MANY things in Brotherhood are all memorable that you really will not be able to just select one thing first, nor will you be able to pick just one item either.  This is an anime that is hitting on all cylinders and scoring on all marks, there is little else they could've done to make this better other than expanding the story and length to increase the character depth; but, to be honest that may have been overboard. \n          \n\nDeeper characters are really the only area were they could've improved a bit, but not by much as all the main characters are hashed out very well.  It is in fact many of the evil characters that could've used some extra storytelling, but that is a hard thing to accomplish in almost any show for the bad guy(s).  Overall there is no real lack of background or dimensionality to these characters other than perhaps their personal or love relationships, which were always handled for the most part at an arm's length.  Winry and Ed's relationship out of all of them really could have used an extra bit of elbow grease, so that when the end finally arrives it really would've meant that much more to Ed, to THEM, and to US!  Adding in some fireworks for other characters would've been nice, but this WAS realistically a show based in a VERY heavily militaristic city and community.  So fraternization, much like army life in almost any country in the world, is basically forbidden until you are off-duty AND off base.  This is why Ed's relationship COULD'VE been helped as we follow them and they DO get off base and they DO go around Winry, specifically.  But, I'm complaining about nothing to be honest...the show is more than fine as it stands.\nThe animation is wonderful and rich.  The combat especially is always great and for some reason, with this anime specifically, it has left a very unique mark on the anime landscape.  When I think of how the animation runs together and the battles there is no other anime I can think of that is remotely like it.  So far it IS a unique and one-of-kind creation.  It is definitely a anime series worth a re-watch and a re-watch after that!  It is that good and evokes so many great memories of adventure, danger, wonder, intrigue, and with that comes the fun of cheering Ed and Al on (and many of their compatriots as well)!  Getting people that have never watched this together to give it a run through is more than worth it so that they can do exactly what I just said in the sentence before and with that you can relive that experience vicariously through them; it really does make it almost just as fun as seeing it the first time...  \nBeyond the animation you have the wonderful music.  The music CANNOT be left out here...  It is just as important I truly believe as the characters, the story, the animation, and anything else that has gone into the production of Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood.  This will be some of the most memorable music you will ever listen to in anime.  You may find yourself when done with the series seriously considering buying all of the music for the series.  The orchestral music for the main portion of the show is wonderful and while I may not like all of the ending or opening theme songs, you will more than likely find a few you do like as Brotherhood will have a lot for you to pick from when all is said and done.  The music had to be mentioned in it's own right as a separate issue, as it's so well done it deserves a lot of merit and needs to be mentioned as a reason to watch the series as well.  It IS that good!\nBeyond everything I've mentioned, some small details that I should go ahead and say is that the English dubbed version of Brotherhood is more than worth your time.  Not only is all the voice acting done VERY well, but all of the miscellaneous noises have been changed as well as things that typically are not like small text on screen (though not having to do with dubbing, it does have to do with the overall \"English adaptation\" that has been created.  The English dubbing, plus the fact that they have gone to the trouble of replacing ALL of the text (everywhere!) to English as well shows the high level of commitment they had in making sure that not only did Japanese audiences get a great version, but so did English audiences!  I will be forever thankful for that as this is easily one of my most favorite anime--it just got so many things RIGHT!  The re-watchability of this anime is very high.  Not only because it's good, but to catch the small things you may have missed the first go around; especially, if you are not someone that grabs all of the more complicated details right off the bat as this show definitely has some, the farther into the show the more that will pop-up (and more for you to pay attention for IN THE PAST)...   \nThe story is epic, how else can I put it.  It is amazing how far you go from where you start and finally where you end at.  This IS an adventure; an adventure of two brothers that have suffered from a grievous wound, both mentally, emotionally, and physically...and to some extent it has even taken a toll on their souls...  We follow these brothers as they figure out how to repair this horrible damage they've inflicted upon themselves and in the process they make a lot of friends, they make a lot of enemies, they learn A LOT, and that simple promise they made to each other to heal each other and to free themselves of their self-made curse might be just enough to get them through anything.  They learn in the end what matters and what doesn't and they realize those that are evil simply just never learn that lesson.\nOverall I give this a 10/10.  The weakest areas I think are characters at 9/10; but trust me this isn't a big decrease, it's more that I wish they would have added more onto characters that were already there or spent even more time on specific development areas on the main characters (I always want more character back-story...).  The next negative is the art area at 9/10.  Again this isn't a big decrease and in certain areas, like combat, it doesn't apply as they've done a spectacular job here.  Really all they could have done is added more team members and gotten a bigger budget with a bigger studio/editing crew.  Without that I'm not exactly sure how they would hit 10/10.  BUT, they have far more positives than they ever could have in the negative department.  While I don't really like all the opening or ending thematic music for Brotherhood, the actual music for the show is beautiful and basically puts a large amount of the anime produced in the garbage bin when comparing music score.  If you want an idea of what I'm talking about, just head over to Youtube and do a search for FMA: Brotherhood OST music score (CD track; I think the one you buy has 84 tracks, I could be wrong though).  Then you can listen to a LARGE chunk of Brotherhood's music--it's worth your time. \nIf you enjoy anime, you can watch the first few episodes of Brotherhood easily around on the net; either on Youtube or many other places, but try to give Brotherhood atleast till episode ten if for some reason you don't like it off the bat.  Brotherhood is a \"little\" slow at the start; by \"slow\" I mean it hasn't gotten into the \"swing\" of it's main story arc.  Once THAT starts up, that is when Brotherhood turns into a roller-coaster and you are stuck in the seat until the ride comes to a complete stop!  This is easily a show I recommend to get on Blu-Ray as a blind buy!  WHAT A RIDE!\nJust like a roller-coaster, you get right back in line, again, and again...\n        "},

But needed to sacrifice one of his arms for that. Then the two brothers joined the army in order to get their bodies back. From here the real story begins. \nThis anime is unbelievable if you think about what they all handle. The main question of the story is “what is the value of life?”. This is the question where the protagonist had problems with during the whole series. Actually the main reason why that I find this is a very serious shonen is because the way they let you see politics. It is unbelievable how good and detailed it is. You see things like corruption, racism, religion, terrorism, people with a god complex, … . The way you see everybodys thoughts and however you can completely disagree with them you understand what they think and why. The way everybody from different sectors thinks about the value of life is probably one of the most interesting things about the serie since it is combined with all the other thoughs of them. What does people do to get power/succes?, how do people change once they get it? are some other interesting questions that will be answered as well. You can really make endless compares to history. Par example the way the regime attacks a certain religion is comparable with hitler’s regime that attacked the jewish, the one from that religion that wanted revenge and became a terrorist is comparable with al qaida, ... . Thats why I think this serie explains politics even better than Code Geass.\nThen I haven’t even talked about the homunculi yet. There even more interesting than politics. It are creatures that thinks they are the evolution of mankind since they are kinda superior to humans. But the most interesting part is that they all have one emotion. Such as lust, envy, greedy, pride, … .It basically shows what these are and what people do if they're obsessed with that emotion.\nThe openings/endings are very good however the rest of the OST isn’t that good or special. The art isn’t anything special either. The characters are very good not that they are such special themselve but there just plenty of original and interesting ones. The amusement was okay but I wasn’t that exciting while watching it in the first 40 episodes. The other 24 where good of excitement but again nothing special. The fights are very original with all that alchemy shit so these where very exciting to watch. In my opinion that serie had to do it with the story and didn’t had anything too special for the rest however the story makes up for everything and makes it a absolutely a need to watch anime for every shounen lover. So don’t think it is or I find this not worthful to watch just cause I gave it only a eight. Eight is considered as very good and I don’t like to give all good shows tens cause then my favorites won’t come out my list anymore.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This is my review of FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Or rather, it's my opinion on why FMAB is the greatest anime ever made.\nNote though that I have not seen the 2003 anime nor have I read the manga ; I bring this up because a lot of people who are fans of the 2003 anime bash on Brotherhood for either being a rehash of the mythos and not having as much 'impact' as the 2003 one. I don't exactly know what they are going on about as I'm not a fan of the 2003 version but I respectfully disagree with them. That aside, why do I\n          \n        think FMAB is one of the greatest anime of all time? Because it gets literally everything that a good story should have right and more.\nFor one thing, it is an epic, epic story. A lot goes on in every episode and the scale of the journey is big, spanning a whole continent plus some of its neighbors. Its one of the few modern works of fiction that deserves to be called a saga (saga means heroic journey of great length) and its world is really unique, original and actually pretty believable. Sure, alchemy is unrealistic. Sure, it does not exist. No, that doesn't really make 'realistic' anime better than FMAB. Haven’t you guys heard of suspension of disbelief?! As long as a world sticks to its own rules and FMAB does just this, I devour a work and its world.\nWhenever I search out any work of fiction, the first thing I look for are great and compelling characters and when it comes to character, FMAB hit it right out of the park; it has some of the most inspiring, unique, compelling and relatable characters ever, be they villains, heroes, allies or even minor characters. Edward Elric never gives up no matter how much crap he goes through (yeah, sound familiar? kenshinhimuragutskenzotenmagokuetc... hey, that’s not a bad thing, it's actually a very good thing). He is a bit whiny when it comes to his pride and height but not when he goes through actual bad stuff. No, when he does you can be sure he'll try to fix it by any means possible. Al is also a very great character; looking up to his brother and helping him out with his quest to gain their bodies back and honestly, can you imagine FullMetal Alchemist without Alphonse? The two complete each other with their brotherly love and companionship and this companionship helps them out a ton in their journey.\nThe rest of the Elric allies, I will not mention as there are too flipping many. However, they are all very fun, likable and when some of them do die, it's heartbreaking and haunting. Yes, even the death of THAT character that died in episode 20 or so of the 2003 FMA but died in episode 10 of FMAB was very tragic and haunting. I could not believe it and the rest of the series became really suspenseful because of that.\nThe villains are also great. Scar is mysterious and interesting, the Homunculi are for the most part fun and even scary and Father who turns out to be the big bad is a fascinating, horrifying and a really effective villain. One thing that did bother me though and the next sentence is a minor spoiler for a character death, was that the homunculus Lust was killed off too quickly whereas according to the stuff I read, she was a much more interesting character in the 2003 version. It did bother me a little but not by much because the Homunculi Wrath, Pride and of course, Greed more than made up for any loss of her character. I think my most favorite villain in Brotherhood ha to be Wrath. He's just really scary and a very real threat to our heroes and I won't spoil who he is but it's really surprising. And then there is Envy. Biggest. Bastard. Ever. Well, except for Griffith. And Johann. And Dan'Ichiro Sanka. And Hitler. What, only fictional characters count?\nFMAB also has without a doubt the best depiction of women in all of fiction. Sure, there are the usual tsunderes in this anime like Winry and Izumi Curtis but they still come out as fully fledged characters and despite Winry being an engineering nerd and Izumi and Riza always moving and being utterly badass, THEY STILL COME OFF AS FEMININE. Finally, a work of fiction where a (relatively) well adjusted woman can actually be herself and acts all girly but at the same is still very competent instead of always needing to be rescued. No women pretending to be like men as if their femminity was a disease needing to be wiped out, nor are there any dumb blondes who get themselves captures or whine about being rescued!\nAnd then there is the Father of the Elric Brothers. I won't spoil his character but trust me he's really compelling and great.\nDoes FMAB have flaws? Well yes, but some of these 'flaws' aren't really flaws. A criticism I often heard for Brotherhood was that it didn't pack as much punch as the 2003 version. I disagree so much with this reasoning because FMAB is one of those very rare anime that brought put all of my feelings: it made me cry (those war scenes, oh my gosh...), it made me think (war is bad but can it be used to do good?), it made me angry (Envy you bastarded son of a...), it even made me happy and elated. I, an 18 year old man at the time, found myself cheering for the characters out loud when they were doing something awesome as if I was watching my favorite football team scoring a goal. No other anime or manga, not even Berserk made me do such things. Then there were the times where I was really disturbed. I think Brotherhood is one of the most violent anime out there. It's not Berserk levels in its blood and gore but it's fairly graphic especially when the Homunculi themselves are getting beaten up. However, those scenes weren't really disturbing and to me, episode 4 of the anime was one of the saddest moments I've ever seen. I did not see that moment coming and when it did, I was speechless and felt really empty inside. So to me, the idea that Brotherhood didn't pack a big punch is a non-sensical argument as it really did get a lot of different feelings from me.\nThe comedy was also pretty nice. Edward despite being such a badass is hysterical when he's all angry about his own height (IF YOU PRAY, YOU'LL DEFINITELY BECOME TALLER!) and the funniest joke involved Winry actually KILLING Edward with her wrench. That scene came out of nowhere and the fact it was never mentioned again made it all the more hilarious. The comedy never takes away from the mood though and like the Higurashi anime, the comedy made the characters seem closer to us and friendly; comedy when done well can actually give characters a ton of depth. Edward may never give up and he's still really smart but he's still impulsive and stubborn.\nSomeone else told me that FMAB doesn't stand on its own, meaning you have to watch it from the beginning in order to understand the plot instead of picking it up 20 episodes or so in and starting from there. While I am someone who thinks that works of fiction like books or films in a series should stand on their own, to me it doesn't count for TV series animated or not. TV series have a huge advantage over films, animated or not, in that they have much more time and narrative devices to explain their story and in my opinion, this should be taken advantage of. Not every series has to have an episodic format (like Cowboy Bebop which I didn't like) especially if the story doesn't call for it and why would anyone watch any series with only 64 episodes 20 episodes or so in? While it's true that episodic anime are more mainstream and probably bring in a bigger audience, the fandom that you bring in with a non-episodic anime will still be big and it will be a dedicated fandom always analyzing and dissecting your work.\nIf I had to name a real flaw Brotherhood had, I do think the first 10 episodes were a bit rushed. Oh they were still deep, well written and compelling but compared to the rest of the anime I agree that they were rather rushed. Sometimes the animation does look a bit off model and a character in the last episode does look a much older than he really is due to off-model animation. However, none of these flaws took away from my enjoyment of the anime and I find the story to have very little flaws. There was really only one moment where I didn't quite buy that a character would do such a thing because I always thought that this character was way smarter than she really is. Also, what on earth happened to my dear Sheska?! I want to know more about her even though she is as minor as you can get with a character!\n Either way, the plot is as close to perfect as you can get. Hell, for such a complex system of fantastic science (alchemy is not magic. Even the Catholic Church studied alchemy in the middle ages, look it up), I understood and believed everything so that when the characters did search and discuss the different forms of alchemy, I understood what they were saying and was never confused.\nMy final verdict for FMAB is a 10/10 for masterpiece. It is a definite must watch and while fans who saw the 2003 version may dislike Brotherhood's early episodes, I've seen just as many fans love both equally so it's highly, highly recommended. It has something for everybody, is relatively free from fanservice and it's really fun and awesome in the end.\nPS: About FMAB being the greatest anime ever. Lets be realistic now, while it certainly is one of the best, no anime or manga that is truly great is better than another. FMAB is part of the pantheon of great anime, those anime that have alot of  influence on the world and are also very well written.  I won't name them but FMAB is definitely one of the greatest ever.\n        "},

I've seen a lot of other people's reviews and I'm constantly seeing the same pattern, which is that everyone is comparing Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to the first series, Fullmetal Alchemist. I'm here to break that pattern and say I love them both equally. I feel that one can't compare them, because both series are very different.\nStory:\nThe frist series story was great. I liked how although it used the same characters and the bases of the storyline, they created something very different from the manga. Usually\n          \n        I don't like when animes don't follow mangas, but the first series wasn't suppose to follow the manga and it took a totally different turn that was amazing in it's own way. For the brotherhood series (which went just like the manga), was also an amazing story. The brotherhood version focused more on the corruption in the world, while the first version still did as well, but more emotional. The first series made me cry more, because almost everything died in the series (while the second series I still cried, but got more pissed at all the corruption in their world). In other words, one isn't better than the other, because both series have their perks and fill in the gabs that each one had.\nArt:\nThe art is great in both of them. Obviously the first version had an older art, and the brotherhood version's art was more crisp and vibrant (but that's just because one came out in 2003 while the other in 2009...big time leap).\nSound:\nI like all the openings and endings in both series, because they all fit the arc that they are introduced in. All the sounds played during the episodes also fit the scenes.\nCharacters:\nI remeber hearing on one form that Ed and Al's relationship was stronger in the first series, but that's not true...in both series there put to similar and different situations that test there brotherhood. And without fail, those two always stick together. There bond is just as strong in both series. For other characters, some didn't exists in the first series that existed in brotherhood. Some characters were more important/less important in brotherhood than they were in the first series, which didn't effect either stories. In both series, one either hates a character, loves them, or has no opinion on...but it's mostly love or hate.\nOverall:\nOne series isn't better than the other, one was meant to go by the manga and one wasn't. Both stories were amazing, truthful, and brought tears to one's eyes. I love and appreciate both series, and I hope you do too. I suggest people to watch both  series (but to watch Fullmetal Alchemist then Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, because if you watch Brotherhood first you will just find yourself constantly critiquing how the first series doesn't follow the manga...so you won't enjoy the messages each series has to offer you.) I watched the first version when I was like seven years ago and I just finished Brotherhood, and not once did I compare.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Almost flawless anime with no real glaring problem what so ever. This anime gets a lot of praise and no wonder why. I myself can safely say that this is the best anime I have seen (by far) by a long way. This anime is truly magnificent.\nThe anime is mostly based on two characters, Edward and Alphonse Elric also reffered as the Elric brothers, trying to get their bodies back after they lost them in an attempt to bring their mom back to life. Edward lost his left leg trying to bring his mom back and his right arm when he brought Al back to\n          \n        life, because Al lost his whole body and he is now able to be \"alive\", but his soul is trapped inside a suit of armor. They have some epic battles and an epic journey during the series, but I won't spoil them because it will be much more enjoyable to watch them instead of getting told what happens.\nNow, I will list all the pros and cons I can think of.\nPros:\nGreat story, the start was almost directly from the first fma and it really was not an issue, because the creators didn't strech it for too long, the middle of the series was actually really good as well and the ending was perfect.\nArtstyle was very pretty at times and it was very good for the whole series.\nThe voice acting was amazing and the sound effects or music was never too loud.\nCharacters were amazing, I think there was not a single character I had a problem with.\nCons or may you say a con:\nThe art, even though it was amazing, it wasnt the quality it could have been at times.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The manga Hiromu Arakawa is so deep that deserved an anime adaptation, but the first adaptation: \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" was made almost with the manga. Result, it has a totally different end of the sleeve, in fact the anime ended well before the manga that was published between 2002-2010 since the anime aired between 2003-2004. But it is not bad, in fact it is an amazing anime that long was told it was the best anime ever made to reach 2008, when Arakawa announced that a new anime was being done, the more faithful to the manga. So in 2009 he debuted in\n          \n        Japan, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, but we have to admit that the true strength of FMA was in the West, where the anime is today revered as the best shounen done. Edging out strong contestants as Rurouni Kenshin, Dragon Ball Z, Naruto and Bleach. But he's all that say: No, it is MUCH more than they talk. With a wonderful story, as human characters that you really believe there and an incredible soundtrack, Fullmetal Alchemist is by far the best anime ever made. Perfect"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    Overrated? Just a tad…but still amazing!\nBefore the protests and angry comments start, let me say that I watched Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood without watching the original adaptation. Some of my good friends (who know my taste in anime) recommended Brotherhood because they thought I would get too bored to watch both. I might watch the original adaption later, but regardless - let's dive right into the review!\nStory (7/10) - \"In order for something to be obtained, something of equal value must be lost.\" The story is set around this premise - and the creators do one hell of a job making it work. Interestingly, this is\n          \n        different from most other anime because it not only gives Brotherhood a central theme, but it also logically order many of the different pieces of the story. For example, the whole idea of alchemy, Philosopher's Stones, and all of the fighting would not be possible without this theme of Equivalent Exchange. It makes a ton of sense - and for me, that adds to the pleasure. \nThe plot is also quite solid. It has twists and turns that you might expect from Death Note, while at the same time having various dynamic story arcs (with some arcs being better than others). And I am a total sucker for these kind of stories because they keep me both deeply entertained and inspired. From the development of the villains to unraveling the crooked history of the past, I assure you that you will not get bored. The only negative comment regarding the development is that the seemingly good side never seems to get stronger - while the homunculus get new powers due to the Stones, the good guys just increase their numbers. \nNow, the critique. I found that while the first 30 or so episodes had a really solid grip on the plot, the next 25 episodes just lost control. I feel like some of the fighting felt forced, the main characters disappeared or had weak roles, and  then toward the convergence in Central City toward the end - I was just like “WTF is going on?” There are a few unanswered/rushed aspects such as Flame Alchemy, true differences between the East and the West, how did Father come into existence, where did all the soul eating Dolls go, why did Kimblee help Edward overcome Selim, etc. \nIn conclusion - the strength, entertaining aspects, and inspiring beauty of the OVERALL story overcome a great deal of the confusion and keep the score at a solid 7.\nArt and Sound (7/10 and 9/10 respectively) - The openings and closing of Brotherhood are just phenomenal. For example while there is a lot of debate about how good of a show Naruto: Shippuuden is, most people agree that the openings and closings are legendary and complement the emotional effect of the anime really nicely. FMA: Brotherhood has the same effect. So - if you are watching the show on a free platform that does not have the openings and closing scenes built in, make sure you watch them! In the actual anime, the soundtracks have solid timing in all the crucial scenes (which is common in all really solid anime), which helps bring that inspiring awe to the show. The show graphics are pretty solid - nothing “masterpiece” worthy though. \nCharacter (9/10) - The reputation of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brother really justifies itself in this category. Nearly all the characters are praiseworthy in their own respect. The Elric brothers embark an incredible journey that begins with taboo, but ends with a grueling test of their naive ideals for a better life. Roy Mustang is a sleek, good-willed patriot who isn’t afraid to take matters into his own hand. His loyal crew is praiseworthy. I also love Hughes - typical happy dude. I’m thinking of all the other characters, but the thing is that there are so many that are acted out so well that I don’t think listing them all will do justice. I mean everything is perfect…except one major thing…no development in powers (i know it’s childish, but the point is valid). In the end, when the Ishbalans finally unlock the Eastern transmutation circle that is supposed to increase alchemy powers and Edward makes an epic entrance in battle, what happens? NOTHING. THERE IS LITERALLY NO DIFFERENCE. I mean I was expecting some bloody fireworks and the show gave us some lame sparklers. \nOverall (8/10) - Look. Brotherhood is an amazing show. I am just a very picky dude so I tore it apart in places where most people don’t give a shit. Overall, the show is phenomenal and is an absolute must-watch for any anime fan.\nVerdict - while I do not think it should be in the top 3 anime of all time, I still think it’s pretty freaking awesome and definitely worthwhile. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Hagane No Renkinjutsuhi (also known \"Fullmetal Alchemist\") is the anime based manga by Hiromu Arakawa, the story styled after the Europan Indiustrial Revolution. Fullmetal Alchemist was serialized in Square Enix's Monthly Shonen Gangan magazine between August 2001 and 2010. In 2009, Bones makes the remastered of Fullmetal Alchemist, the title of the remake is \"Hagane No Renkinjutshui: Fullmetal Alchemist\" or \"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\" The story of Brotherhood. Brotherhood made the story same with the manga, in fact Hiromu Arakawa told Bones about the ending of the Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Okay i'm want to reviews the story, art, sound, and character of Fullmetal Alchemist although it's\n          \n        not too much. I like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood because the story so logical, the character's art face it's resembles where their lived (Example: Edward's face is like Europan and Ling's face is very looks like eastern).\nStory (10/10):\nThe story of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is closely from the manga, yeah Bones wants to plan for making Fullmetal Alchemist Brothehood story same with the manga to fix the story of previous series (Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)). The storyline of Fullmetal Alchemist is very logical and it's too based in real life historical example the conflict between Amestrian Military with the Ishalan, i look in internet about facts of Fullmetal Alchemist, war between Amestrian Military with the Ishvalan it's based of World War 2. \nThe plot of the story, the Elric brothers that is Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric want to revive their mother because their mother passed away because sick and to do that, Edward and Alphonse need to know materials to make people, increase their alchemy ability. Before Edward and Alphonse save their mother (use human transmutation), they trained by their teacher named \"Izumi Curtis\" the training of the alchemy it's so hard than their expected, they must lived in survive in Yorke Island for once a month plus they must dealing with the monster (Maison) from that island (in the Fullmetal Alchemist Brtoherhood there's not scene when Edward and Alphonse dealing with Maison who want to attacks them). and after survival training, Edward and Elric train to increase their alchemy for several days, after that, Elric and Alphonse back to their house to revive theri mother with human transmutation but the result of transmutation is fail because the body to use tranmutation isn't their mother and Edward loses his  left leg while Alphonse loses his body, Edward sacrifice his right hand to saves Alphonse with put his soul into the almunium armor. Several years later after Edward join the military, Edward and Alphonse want to find the way to find a way to turn their bodies back. The plot is good for me, that plot is bit different with the shoune anime and the storyline, the storyline is always connected with the main character's goal because Hiromu Arakawa focused to the purpose of the story than the journey. That's why Fullmetal Alchemist story is short than the shounen anime like Naruto and One Piece. The Philosopher Stone is the main object of the story because Pholosopher Stone can makes Edward and Alphonse's bodies back again but they are reject to use it because the Philosopher Stone it's a stone which made from human, Edward and Alphonse find another way to get their bodies back wihtout use the Philosopher Stone, this is what makes the story very powerful because there's another way to finish the problem although that problem it's so difficult to be completed.\nArt (8/10):\nBones was better to makes Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, the art is closely to the manga although the previous version is like too. The art of the Brotherhood is more shine and colorful than the previous Fullmetal Alchemist version (2003). The effect animation of Electric while use alchemy and explosion is bit closely to real life effect. There's no 3D CGI in that anime (i think) from the beginning episode until end. Yeah i think although Bones doesn't have a realistic art but the animation and the effect it's so more better and closely to realistic. \nSound (8/10):\nI think I did not explain much for the sound but the sound is like boom! and bam!, yeah i hear like that because when i watching Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood when scene of explosion and people get punch that sounds like that. The sound of land move (alchemy) and car crash is hear like realistic for me, that sounds was epic and i hype that, Bones made Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood so best.\nCharacter (10/10):\nThere's more chracter with different race in Fullmetal Alchemist, there's a Amestrian with white skin, Ishvalan with black skin, and Xing like Chinese people. This is like real life people with a different race, this is the part i'm like it because there's not only 1 race of people of this anime, there's rarely anime display characters that different race, company with a very distinctive appearance.\nHiromu Arakawa so smart to makes a character, before makes character, Hiromu Arakawa must know very well the character to be made. See characters from Fullmetal Alchemist with Arakawa's idea: \n-Ishvalan and Amestrian based on Ainu and Wajin from real life people. \n-the reason Edward use black clothes because it use to hide stain oil  from his automail. I think that's useful when Edward battle with his enemy and his enemy didn't know that there's oil in Edward automail  that means Edward got weak and it's usefull too, Edward can wash his black clothes easily because he washing just to scent his clothes.\n-Alphonse's nickname \"Al\" is chemical symbol for almunium because his armor made from almunium.\n-The members of military are named after an aircraft like P-51 Mustang, E-2 Hawkeye, Douglas A-20 Havoc, Breda B-65, Nakajima Ki-84 hayate, etc. I think the reason Arakawa named them because they are the military and their suits like army Air Force.\n-The reason Edward short because his energy keeping Alphonse alive. Edward and Alphonse's are linked through the gateway of truth. Edward eats is also being used as energy for Alphonse's body.\nBut there's a weird thing that Edward hates milk but he likes Stew it maybe that Edward hates things what is issued by the cow.\nYeah this is my first reviews in MAL, sorry that this reviews it's not too much but i wonder you can understand with my reviews, thank you.\n        "},

At first I was very worried that this show wouldn't deliver due to its immense hype and showers of praise, however I'm very glad that I watched this show and by no means it isn't  a masterpiece but it is a very engaging watch nevertheless.\nPlot:\nThe Premise of FMA:B is a very interesting one, from the very beginning the ideas of alchemy kept me intrigued and I was very curious to learn more about this strange 19th Century\n          \n        World.\nNow to talk about the actual plot; the plot follows two brothers, Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric. After the death of their mother these brothers try to use alchemy and its rule of equivalent exchange to resurrect their deceased mother, unfortunately this failed horrible for Edward and Alphonse and they lost parts of their bodies. Due to this catastrophic event both Edward and Alphonse set out to find a way to retrieve their bodies whilst facing many obstacles in their journeys.\nArt:\nThe art wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. One of the things that I did appreciate though is that the animation staff put a lot of effort to make the battle scenes look the best, however by no means is it mind blowing. Though as the episodes go the animation starts to get slightly better.\nSound:\nThe sound was done incredibly well, the soundtrack fits beautifully to the situation of the scene and thus in my opinion the soundtrack helped to heighten the drama when necessary.\nCharacters:\nNow I have a few issues with some of the characters. Due to this being a shounen anime one can assume that there would be a large cast of characters and due to this some characters feel very undeveloped or don't get enough screen time to really make an impact.\nI mean certain characters such as Winry or Havock didn't pull any heart strings as they were intended too and i generally didn't really care about their struggles. \nThough don't get me wrong, there were some amazing characters with very good development but surprisingly it wasn't Edward or Alphonse(They were good characters but not the most interesting and most captivating)characters such as Scar, Wrath ,Greed ,Mustang and Hoheheim were truly amazing, they weren't generic and I usually would wonder about their thought process and motivations.\nBUT, the one that really STEALS the show in my opinion is Envy, though Envy by no means is a nice person/being but Envy puts a heck of a performance and thus is one of the more intresting antagonist in this series.\nEnjoyment:\nI truly enjoyed this series, one of its strong aspects is that throughout FMA:B certain philosophical questions would be asked:\nSuch questions include:\n- How valuable is human life?\n-Can one mimic God himself and create life?\n-Can one suppress God if enough power is obtained?\nUnfortunately one thing that irritated me is that the anime would shift from seriousness to comedy gags, this happened a lot in the beginning but less towards the end.\nOverall\nFMA:B is not the masterpiece it is claimed to be, but it's still a very engaging show\nFinal Rating:\nStory 9/10\nArt 7/10\nSound 9/10\nCharacter 7/10\nEnjoyment 8/10\nOverall 8/10"},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    If there was ever such a thing as a perfect anime, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood might be the one. I just finished watching this series and I really cannot think of any major glaring flaws. I still do have a couple unanswered questions but that is to be expected of an anime as complex as FMAB. I watched the first adaptation of FMA years ago and I always felt like I really didn't need to watch Brotherhood because I'd be watching the same thing all over again, but boy was I wrong. I thought the first FMA was good, not great, but I cannot say the\n          \n        same for FMAB. FMAB simply blew me away. The story goes in a completely different direction than the first and I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I forgot about the first series. The only thing FMAB lacks is that background information that you are given in the first series (so I recommend watching at least a little bit of the first FMA before starting Brotherhood). I really didn't know how much I liked Brotherhood until I started watching the last few episodes and realized that this amazing adventure was coming to a close. There have been only a few anime that I have watched that have gotten me truly emotional and FMAB is one of them and that is enough for it to be at the top of my list. At the end I reflected on what the anime had taught me. The common themes throughout this anime are repeated time and time again. Themes like \"in order to gain you must give\", \"in order to grow you must endure and always move forward\" \", \"The strength of many will always outweigh the strength of one\", and \"a human life should never be taken for granted\" are just some of the many that I picked up on while watching FMAB. This show is deep at times, and a little complicated but it is also a story about relationships, overcoming obstacles, courage, determination and other positive characteristics that instill hope and happiness into the viewers. Every character in this anime learns a valuable lesson in one way or another, because they all have their different problems and in effect are able to learn and grow from these setbacks. You will no doubt connect to the characters of FMAB and just like me, you will grow to miss them once you have finished this series. FMAB strength was found in it's stories, stories that we can all relate to and characters that we can root for and sympathize for (and GOAT openings and endings). This anime is #1 for a reason, i'm not saying it's my absolute favorite but it really is a near perfect anime that I have grown quite fond of. I would like to think that I am a reasonable and realistic anime fan, so please take my review seriously because I'm really not one to hype up an anime like its the greatest thing in the world. Hopefully you give FMAB a chance like I did, because I can assure you that you will not be disappointed.\n        "},

		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=15,   ["text"]="                          \n    This review isn't going to be as detailed and in-depth as I feel it should be, and while I do address various things, I don't address every single thing I like or dislike about this series. Regarding that, there are some things that stood out to me within this series that definitely would leave it a 5, or maybe even a 4, out of 10 for me. I will also be trying to address things in an overall sense rather than picking out individual details and events to help explain them because if you've seen this show, you know what happens, basically, so you know\n          \n        what I'm talking about without me needing to address every single little thing that happens. That being said, unfortunately, there are some spoilers in this review.\nThis series was very disappointing, but the fact that it's rated number one on this site honestly doesn't surprise me. First, though, I'll just go over the less significant of the flaws before addressing the deal-breakers. Keep in mind, I did watch the original 2003 anime. Immediately before having started this one. This review is not based on any amount of bias or nostalgia, because I never grew up with FMA, and I finished this last week. I try to draw as few comparisons as I can between the two different shows, as a result.\nPacing issues are a constant theme, apparently. The first season relied too heavily on you having had seen the original anime, or read the manga, which I think is a bad decision because regardless of whether or not similar things had happened, the events that did happen within the first fifth of the series are still fairly important. Season two was alright (I honestly consider it to have been the best season), and season three was good, as well, up until about halfway through, then it started getting a bit slow. Season four was bad, and oh, god, season five. I had no idea what went wrong with season five. It had all started out too fast, then it found the right speed to take things in season two. Season three started getting slow, and then four and five jumped back up to high speeds, even faster than how season one was going, it felt like. It really left out a lot of room for things to be explained, because important matters were discussed in one or two lines of dialogue, and as the series progresses, a lot of build up garners a minimal reward.\nThere is absolutely no atmosphere in this show. There is no mood at all. What is the mood? What is the tone this is trying to set? The soundtrack has literally ten songs, and the same three are used in every single episode at least once. The only moods set by the music are \"tense\" and \"action,\" and very rarely is it \"cool\". The song that plays during Hohenheim's backstory and during a majority of season five is actually really good, and one of two out of ten songs that I like, but the rest of them are severely overplayed. The present mood is predictable, as a result. The overall mood, however, feels completely nonexistent because there is no emotion in this show. Even people who praise this up and down, I've seen mention how there's no atmosphere and emotion behind anything. How are you supposed to get anything out of it, then? In addition to it having been a result of pacing issues, the backstories and reveals are just treated like nothing, because there's no emotion behind it at all. When they were at Central, I guess, and they were cheering because they thought the Fuhrer was gone but he popped up on the phone and said \"Surprise, I'm back,\" that could have been so cool! But it went immediately from an intense scene, to a slight pause, and then back to the same intensity as it had before. There was no rest at all, and as the series went on, there felt there wasn't any room for emotion because there was just too much going on, and like the emotion was a negligible feature, thus leaving the whole series rather soulless, even during the best parts of the show.\nThe plot is way too goddamn complex. After a certain point, there is just way too much going on to keep track of, even in the sense of the storyteller's perspective, as characters will appear for one scene and then not return until a whole season later. I honestly thought they forgot about Scar's and Riza's backstories, and characters with NO backstory end up being the most important, such as May Chang. There is so much filler with just nameless generals having gun fights, and it really feels like a completely different show once they get to Briggs. It goes from being a fascinating fantasy story with a unique set of physics taking place in a split timeline to being just a boring military show, preferring gunfights over alchemy and science which is meant to be a main theme of the series, and because of how much screen time the nameless grunts get just shooting each other and the Homunculi, it, again, leaves no time for things to actually be explained. Scar's backstory had been addressed in season two to a degree but there were still unanswered questions, and with Scar personally being a character I loved in this one and in the original anime, I was hoping his backstory would be more than two sentences given in the second to last episode that makes no real sense and removes all the magic from the series. It treats important issues like that, and like the Homunculi, the Philosopher's Stone, and like the Gate and Truth, and Father, especially, like it's just nothing, like they're not important, and after a certain point there's no mystery or any amount of credibility to any of these things because of the explanations they give that fail to really explain anything and because of how aware everyone in the world is to these things that are meant to hold an amount of mystery, thus making them interesting and having you want to get more out of the series.\nIf everyone knows about something that's supposed to be mysterious and taboo and mythical, then it's not mysterious and taboo and mythical.\nThere are too many characters to focus on and even in the last season they're adding more and more people it expects you to keep track of, and it's insane. One of the few comparisons I'll draw with the original 2003 anime is that while the story did have plot holes and was far from perfect, it was concise, consistent, and every character got development, rarely diverging from the central themes even in the filler episodes. Alphonse Elric, the protagonist's brother, feels like he isn't even a character. He is the protagonist's BROTHER. He has been there the /entire time/, his goddamn body was missing and he was a skilled alchemist like his brother, most of Edward's story has to DO with his brother, and he doesn't even feel like a character because he's barely in it and you only realize that he's not in it when you stop and ask where he is. There is a severe lack of character development in this series, treating major characters like they don't mean anything and treating minor characters like the world rests on their shoulders, like with May Chang, and another thing that worsens that is when there has been a massive amount of build up to something, it just doesn't even matter because, like I said, the payoff is nonexistent.\nFather had such immense potential to be an amazing villain. You see him sitting there, around all these wires and tubes, looking like a figure from Biblical theology. His voice is strong, and commanding, and he's always sitting in that chair, and there's this intense feeling of mystery around him. He looks like Hohenheim, the protagonists' father, and you ask yourself, are they the same person? Did Hohenheim leave his kids to go create the Homunculi? Is it a split personality, or is it an illusion? Who could he be, and what? You then find out his backstory, along with Hohenheim's, in about eight minutes. You learn the history they share in eight minutes. Eight whole minutes to explain the backstory of the main antagonist and one of the primary characters in the show, who have both had massive build up to be these mysterious, powerful figures, and while the explanation they give is perhaps the best in the entire series, it all comes crashing down when, without giving major spoilers, everyone in Central knows who Father is, why he's there, what he's doing, and he ends up being a generic shounen villain who stops using alchemy and starts using magical powers. If everyone knows he's there, why he's there, and what he's doing, then he's not mysterious anymore, and it takes away all credibility the story has in that sense, and he was probably the most disappointing part of the entire series. He went from intriguing and mystifying and fearsome to Sephiroth and Anubis from the Yuugiou movie.\nIt stops being about alchemy. I mentioned that already, but I still can't get over that. If you wanted to make a show that focuses on corruption in the government and in the military, then just do that. Don't give it a unique fantasy setting only to not focus on that after a certain point, and especially don't have a fantasy setting that relies on scientific fact and the legitimate physics of that world, explained by science, end up being about magical powers and plaTE TECTONICS???????????? The military in the show is way too advanced for that time period, anyway, in terms of the techniques, strategies, and even the weapons they use, but that's minor and it doesn't even fucking matter after a certain point. Nothing matters after a certain point. The show is about alchemy, and that stops mattering after a certain point. It also has less to do with real-world alchemy than the original anime did, actually, and I find that interesting seeing as how the 2003 anime diverged relatively early on and made a vast amount of changes to the story and characters.\nA homunculus, in terms of real-world alchemy, is a failed attempt at creating a human being. In the 2003 anime, a homunculus is a failed attempt at human transmutation. In Brotherhood, they don't tell you what it is. Ultimately, in the end, they don't tell you what a homunculus is. It mentions that the seven deadly sins are formed from Father's emotions, but that doesn't have any effect on anything and feels like it was just shoe-horned in, as does most things; and, like I said, if you've seen the series you know that those aren't the only Homunculi I mean. The deadly sins are also a Greek concept, as is alchemy, but in the original it feels that, universally, they have more to do with alchemy as a real science than they do in Brotherhood, which is supposed to be the \"real\" story. They even go more into the actual science behind alchemy in the original anime, and in Brotherhood their explanation is\nplate tectonics. I guess.\nThere was the Gate, though, which was very loosely implied to have more to do with real alchemy, as each person who passes through the Gate has their own symbol on the door related to ideas presented by alchemists in the real world, which I actually had to look up on my own and I felt it would have definitely added to the story, but at that point I simply didn't care and at this point I just find it really cool. They never explain what the Gate is, or why it contains infinite alchemical knowledge, or why the Truth provides it for you. The Truth gets an explanation, though.\nHe's supposed to be God. Literal God, in a series where the main character is a vehement atheist and the theme of religion being a farce was made very clear in the first three goddamn episodes. Truth isn't Consciousness, or an idea of sorts. He's literally God, in a series where God isn't supposed to /exist/. Between you and me, I'd take Nazi Germany over that any day, because at least it's an explanation that makes more sense than \"it just exists, and it's controlled by God\".\nThere are things I liked more about this, though, than I did the original 2003 anime, to show that I don't think this whole thing is a complete crock of shit. Hohenheim, for example, is a much greater character. He's actually on my top list of favorite characters. It explores the world more, and Mustang and his entire crew are more likable in this one. Mustang and Riza are amazing together. I loved Wrath and Pride in this one a lot more than in the original. I liked the ideas of the Gate and of Truth, and I'm just going to pretend the last five episodes didn't happen. Scar was cooler in this one, and I loved Olivier.\nWhat do I wish they would have done differently? Aside from the pacing, lack of focus and character development and reasonable explanations, as well as a lack of consistent themes, there were some things that I wish they would have changed to have more of an impact or to make it stand out more. I wish the Homunculi were more of a collective, because then it would have made more sense regarding their origin and Greed's defecting in both instances. I wish Father's base of operations were elsewhere, and I wish all of season five was just rewritten. It starts going into the plot again completely out of nowhere partway through an episode in the last season, and ugghhh I don't want to go into all of that. I wish the Gate and Truth were more explored, I wish the lands around Amestris were more explored, I wish that Pride and Wrath got even more development than they did. I wish Envy didn't turn into a giant six-legged green hair dog lizard thing with people on it. I wish May Chang wasn't even in it.\nOverall, and in conclusion, I can best describe Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood as being a whole amalgamation of mystery and buildup only to have the writing in the story dismiss it with little explanation and by not addressing things that feel like they should matter. I still have a lot of unanswered questions, regarding Ishbal, Xerxes, and the dwarf in the flask. About Xing, about Drachma, about the fate of the Philosopher's Stone and about alchemy as a science. I have unanswered questions about the characters, and I'm never going to get any of those answers. Brotherhood was generic, disappointing, and while I'm aware this review isn't the best I could have written, I hope you found it useful.\nWhy does Pride become a fetus with a nipple on his forehead.\n        "},

Through equivalent exchange, something of equal value must always be lost. That is the rule of alchemy. \nWords cannot describe what I just watched. I can see why it's still number one after all these years. I've seen some impressive plots, but this has to be the top of the line, the best of the best, it doesn't get better than this. It only took me around a week to complete both series, but I can't describe in words how inspiring and heartwarming\n          \n        this story was. \nPlot:\n I know for a fact a manga plot lines are super long and can be as long as 600+ chapters, but this plot, from watching the anime, was the perfect length. The pace flowed perfectly throughout each episode, adding both drama, suspense, comedy, and even some hidden romance. The theme was clearly stated at the beginning as \"Brotherhood\", of course, but also love, family, friendship, acceptance, and even sacrifice. There were no fillers unlike the original, and everything connected perfectly like a puzzle piece. I found no cliche bits, and felt they established the \"normal\" very early on this time. I felt very satisfied with the ending, and agree it was a cherry on top of an ice cream sundae with milk on the side! \nArt: \nThere are many different styles throughout the anime/manga world, and each artist has their own unique style, but this art work felt more original than any other anime I've seen. There were no giant anime eyes or rainbow hair. I got the feeling of realism with the simple look. And even throughout the anime, I found the character's appearances changed throughout the 64 episodes, then they would with another anime with over 300 episodes. Even Al changed with his little hair piece was enough.\nWhat I also liked about the art was the background. I've only seen a few anime shows where the animator will put effort into a background instead of throwing in one that looks like a crappy painting. FMA Brotherhood had detail, composition, and realism. The world was created perfectly and beautifully. \nSound: \nLet's start with music. Every scene, every event, was filled with the most beautiful music. It fit so well with every single thing that happened. The angst, the dramatic, the suspenseful, happy, sad, and every other moments created such a great emotion to each episode, and they had a tune for each unique one. I felt the tension flow through my veins every time some kind of music came on. \nThe sound effects hit the ball right out of the park as well. The booming, the rain, the explosions, even the flickering of a small fire, it all tied in perfectly to set the mood. \nNow voice of each character. I'm a dubbed person, because one, I'm constantly multitask-er, so subbed doesn't work for me as much. I don't care if subbed is better, because I'm pretty sure I would've gotten the same experience. But it doesn't matter, because compared to the original dubbed, this one sounded the same. I do think Vic did a better job on this one then the last because he knew the character more the second time around. Maxey was perfect for Al, even though at time I could hear a girlish tone, but it did set the character very well. And the rest of them, each character had a distinct voice and attitude. \nCharacter: \nTwo words: No stereotypes. One of my biggest pet peeves when I watch an anime series is stereotypical characters. And this series had none. The creator of this story did very well on making sure the characters were original as ever. The character development, as well, was so clearly made. All the characters grew up (for Ed, literally), and accepted what was happening, what had happened, and knew their goals and how they had to change to achieve them.  \nLoved the humour added in each character as well...like Ed's hatred of milk and being called short. As well as the strong willed and toughness for Ed and Al. Anything is possible even if you have two auto mail limbs or become a soul in a large suit of armour. \nEnjoyment/Overall:\nLike I said, words cannot describe the enjoyment I felt when I watched this. There was a reason why I finished both in little over a week. No anime can ever level up to the amount of happiness I am with this anime. I cried, laughed, got angry, and clapped at the very end. \nThis story has led up to it's reputation and popularity years after the completion, and I doubt it'll be going down anytime soon.  I recommend it to anyone who...heck just watch it if you haven't seen it. You'll be crazy if you haven't. \n        "},

The purpose of the original characters like those is amazing, because the sensation I had was the I could find people out anime like Edward or any other, on my family, college, because they're no shallow or just \"characters from a magic world with superpowers\".\n\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\n FMAB was made for us watch an animation with a rich content and don't get tired of it. People say \"the story is hard to understand\", where was this? I watched 64 episodes in like... 7 days? This anime is SOFT compared to most all animes I have ever watched.\n\nOVERALL: 10/10\nI'm not a fan yet but FMAB deserves the title of GOD OF THE ANIMES for showing so many things in so few episodes in a way that we get satisfied about all.\n        "},

These are the words that represent FMA, the show that has brought the traditional shonen formula to perfection.\nSTORY: \nThe two main characters commited one of the greatest taboos in the world of alchemy and now they try to fix the mistakes the make. The concept is very simple but in my opinion what makes this story great are themes it tackles. It's about the importance of family, friendship, understanding ones mistakes and most importantly, growing up. These themes have been the subject of a lot of works but few handle them with such mastery as FMA. There are also a\n          \n        few moral and philosophical subjects explored which is rare in most action oriented shonen series. I found the length of the show very satisfying, it was neither too short like angel beats or too long like one piece. It had the perfect amount of episodes for the story it wanted to tell without much noticeable filler content.\nCHARACTERS:\nAll the characters were written and loveable, they had believable motivations and varied personalities, from the immature and playful Edward to the serious and ambitious Col. Mustang. The thing I praise the most is  the character growth. It feels that every character has gained something from this 64 episode long journey. They have matured, some of them by experiencing loss, and they see the world around the differently. I won't talk about each character seperatly because all of the are amazing (even the bad guys) and they don't need individual reviews.\nART:\nIt looks amazing. Most modern low-budget anime have a very digital look to them which bothers me. I was relieved to see that this wasn't the case with FMA. Each character has their own distinct, clever and creative look which enhances their personality. The environments, which were inspired by 19th century industrial cities like Ruhr and Manchester and rural areas like the polish plains look believeable and create a vivid world for the characters to inhabit. There were a few 3D animated parts but they blend in well. I didn't noticed them when I first watched the show.\nSOUND:\nVoice Acting: The performances were amazing and conveyed all the emotions of each scene. HUGE props to the actresses who performed the main characters. The show realied on them to make the protagonists great and they NAILED it. Terrific line delivery.\nSoundtrack: Orchestral music accompanied by choir. The tracks were well writen and matched the mood of the scenes. I'd love it if they included the theme song from the original FMA series since it was very emotional but that isn't really a fair complaint. I found some mixing issues (music playing too loud) and some overreliance on certain tracks but it didn't have a very big impact on the overall experience.\nVERDICT:\nOne of the best shows of all time, recommended for every one. It's the show I use to introduce people to anime."},

The second part fails to capture awesomness of first part opting to do everything as differently as possible from first part. Which is a shame - charecter development is just poor (and some charecters such as Mustang are just boring opposing the brilliant and loved Mustang from first part), the speed of story doesn't leave any time for good plot, idiotic deforming of animation, poor animation in general (despite huge budjet), good OST, that nevertheless fails to shine in comparison to first part and most importantly it fails to use brilliant findings of original anime\n          \n        (such as comparison of Winry-Ed's mother with ligh shining through the hills).

In this world it's called Equivalent exchange.\"\nWhen I first learned that the Brotherhood is being prepared I felt chills. The first series was mostly great, with some weaker elements. The epicness spilled from it no matter which approach you took. However, what really got me into the topic of Elric brothers was not the anime, but the manga. The manga which, to some extend, changed the way I perceive things today. The manga which taught me a lot about life, friendship, priorities. The manga which showed that if you wish for something strong enough - you will receive\n          \n        it, albeit after a long and harsh journey. After all, nothing in this world comes without a price. Equivalent exchange works there indefinitely. \nOk, I may sound like a damn brat at the moment, corellating human's life to a fabricated reality. Whatever. I \nalways believed that animes have this something that we lack in our everyday struggle - they name things, without second thought, no questions asked.\nThe story of Elric brothers is well known to about everyone who's interested in anime. The siblings lose their limbs and bodies due to a foolish act of human transmutation. From this moment, Ed with automail leg and arm and his younger brother Al, an armor with soul attached to it, go on a long and depriving journey to retrieve what they lost and are afraid will never grasp back. As simple as it sounds, it can be quite amusing.\nSTORY.\nAlthough to some it may appear cliche, the story in FMA:B is in fact quite original. First and foremost it mixes many completely various characters in several settings. Those characters somehow resemble their homeplaces in terms of nature, feelings and appearance so when the things go hectic and the Elrics travel from one place to another it's not a hassle to distinguish who doesn't really fit the image. Thus we have Ishbalans, Northerners (Briggs), Southerners (Rush Valley), Westerners in Liore and people from Central. The power of the setting is what makes the place differ completely one from the other. People are different and so are their homes, beliefs, approaches to life. It's all there to entertain you, sure, but if you look deep enough all those people exist for the sole purpouse of making the story believable and the Elrics progress enough to overcome their childish beliefs, behaviors and trusts for something that lays far beyond - A Truth. \"A\" is used here for a reason. In FMA:B 'Truth' exists in everyone and it's individual for all people. There's no universal truth, you create your own with your blood, sweat and tears.\nBeyond that is the approach to the siblings, the way  those two change and evolve into the people who will overthrow their own goal for a common one - the protection of Amestris. It is also frightening when you notice how much they had to sacrifice to reach to that final moment, the moment of glory, retribution, stepping back and unfolding their whole way to that very moment. Throughout the story they learn that All is the World, but the World consists of singularities, of humans; thus All is One, One is All. It's a masterpiece in its own kind to see how this universal idea reflects all the decisions that the brothers make during the show. Some will lead to further complications and some will become tragic in the end.\nA great deal of epicness is ensured by splendid character development in the series. It is refreshing to see how much people progress in this show. Humans are cunning, symphatetic, intelligent and dumb. They're evil and good, direct and retracted, they tell lies and are truthful to their bones. They Envy, they are Greedy but also Sloth and driven by Lust. Their Gluttony for power gives birth to overthrowing Wrath if something goes wrong, but in the end it is their Pride that keeps them going. What about the others? Those perfect? Those who deprived themselves of these Seven Sins? Are they better, perfect? God a-like? Or maybe they are a puny little entities hidden within their own flasks longing for escape, freedom.\nThe creation of Elrics is perfect. They are like the two sides of the same coin: Ed is decisive, outgoing and operative, Al is his counterpart - depending, self-aware and perhaps to impressionable. Other characters shine too: Alex is as entertaining as always, Mustang as cunning as he could be and kindness flowing from Hawkeye or Winry is sometimes just too much. You will cry many times during the show, it's a given.\nART.\nArt is nearly perfect. The animation is splendid, with very little flaws, very little recaps and no stupid mistakes. The way the world is potrayed stands out practically all the time. On one hand we have beatifully painted backgrounds, with delicate fresque and detailed texture which endulge one's mind to further concentration. Places are different, stunning, memorable. The very same idea sticks to the presentation of characters. There's no denying that women are somehow neglected in the show, but this is due to the manga artist and his style, not the anime itself. It simply follows the pattern as accurately as possible. On the other hand, hardly will you see a situation when recognising a particular character is impossible due to a bad drawing. In this show it does not happen. \nPeriod.\nAll the details of using alchemy, ground reformation, CGI effects are simply perfect and I cannot imagine what the show would be like without them. Rarely will you notice that something is wrong or our of ordinary and this becomes even more important by the end of the show, because the level of animation does not drop! Not one bit! It's constant throughout all 64 episodes. Even today it's astounding, escpecially for such long show.\nMUSIC.\nMusic and audio is something I would write an entire book about if I had time and means to do so. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful Japanese creations in the history of the anime market. It can be depicted by: when it is time to cry, go cry, when you laugh, go laugh and when there's fighting, well, go kick ass! Nothing is out of place, nothing is missing. The background, most of the time, is very lyrical. There are moments when you would stop with Ed and Al for a second to contemplate, but the action will not let you. Music is such a strong reinforcement in FMA:B, that sometimes a scene when there's a deafening silence leaves no quarter and distinguishes among many other. Nothing bad will I say about opening and ending sequences - those are splendid. \"Let it out\", \"Period\", \"Rain\" - are only a few examples of how great the soundtrack is. I didn't like how the producers included major spoilers in those sequences though, but that's an entirely different thing altogether.\nSeiyuu's work also requires a few words of praise - people voice acting Ed and Al are one of the best creations I have ever seen in anime. The same goes for General Armstrong and Roy Mustang. Greed/Lin has also had some great voice acting as well as all the Homonculi and 'Our Father'. All in all, one of the very best in the industry. Great job altogether. At this point it is worth mentioning that the moment when Ed shouts 'You idiot!' in final but one episode is the scene when not one 100% man will shed some tears.\nENJOYMENT.\nSome may say that it's fraud because I do not mention alchemy in this review. Well, it is because most of know what alchemy in FMA series is, and besides that, alchemy plays only the second role in FMA:B. Sure, it is important (especially Alkahestry) plotwise, but as you will reach the end of the show you will learn how insignificant it was throughout the whole series from the characters' point of view.\nBut hey, this was supposed to be enjoyment section... Although, most of you have already noticed that I described how enjoyable the series is/was in the STORY segment. I watched the series three times so far and I'm sure that the fourth and fifth will come about in the nearest future. No matter how many times you watch the series you will enjoy it even more than before, and the comedy parts never get old!\nFINAL THOUGHTS.\nAt first I did not really like the story in the original FMA. It was dumb, slow paced, sometimes much too self-centered. FMA:B is a greater alternative story. It uses the same characters in the same settings, adds something from itself, makes a great use of fabulous comedy elements to create a complete anime which will definitely transcend its time. The FMA, despite all flaws, did overthrow much of the industry. People lowed Ed and Al from the moment they learned their back story. It is no different with this title. Some reluctant will say, that sometimes manga does things in a better manner than the anime. OK, their right to complain. I, having watched so many titles in my life, have no words of complain in this one. FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is by far the best anime show that has been released and I assume nothing will change that in the upcoming months. In my personal list it overtook shows like NGE, RaXhephon or Rurouni Kenshin: Romantan.\nA week out of your life well-spent.\n\"All is One. One is All!\"\n"},

What a stunning ensemble. Each and every side character was amazing. Putting them down in words will diminish how amazing this cast is. Definitely one of the best in anime. Heh, there's a reason why this is #1 on\n          \n        MAL. It's most likely because of this cast.\nHere are the 3 things it does wrong,\n1 - The Elric brothers could've been written better.\n2 - Their dad's abandonment and neglect doesn't really make much sense, although I'm glad he admits he's a shitty father.\n3 - The fights had no wow-factor to them. (Again, was expecting something like HxH and Naruto kind of fight scenes). Also a bunch of plot-holes and strong plot-armor.\nBut anyway, if an anime can make me feel sad for a character who barely got 10 minutes of screen time in Trisha Elric, it has to be pretty darn good.\nEpisode 27, that cutaway scene into the end credits. Dang.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    The Shounen genre in anime is one that is almost universally liked or disliked. Reasons of dislike are many, some of them being poorly paced plots, poor characterization, repetitive plots, too many 'asspulls' and a number of filler episodes. The most common example of this is seen by the Big 3 of Shounen which are often bashed around for these problems.\nHowever, at times, there are anime which break the traditional formula and stand out as one of the best. Hunter x Hunter is regarded as the deconstruction of Shounen anime. Gintama is regarded as the greatest comedy anime of all time. And who can forget\n          \n        Death Note, the most popular title on the list? Also, half of the top ten of MyAnimeList is filled with shounen anime which states that the genre can still be very good despite it's usual flaws.\nAnd while talking about shounen anime, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one anime which simply cannot be ignored. Standing at the top of the entire anime list in MAL, this anime is a widely regarded masterpiece which escapes many of the pitfalls it's genre is known for. \nAdapted from Hiromu Arakawa's manga, Fullmetal Alchemist, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood follows the story of two brothers-Edward and Alphonse Elric in a search to find a magical trinket in a world where alchemy is commonly used.\nAs many anime fans know, Brotherhood is a reboot of the original manga. There was already another anime called Fullmetal Alchemist, released in 2003, which followed the ongoing story of the manga but had to deviate from it's path as it was getting too close to the original. As a result, the actual story constituted for only half the anime while the rest was all filler.\nThis leads to a discussion to decide which is the better one, because as the original anime was highly regarded, Brotherhood's change in tone did not sit well with too many fans. I on my part haven't seen the original anime which makes me unable to judge.\nThe principal strength of the anime lies in it's story. On one hand, it's story is intelligent, well-paced and has colorful characters, and on the other hand, the story of Fullmetal Alchemist is one with a lot of depth and philosophical meaning. From the moment the anime gets going, we start to see the depth at which Brotherhood works as it immediately questions religion. From there, not only does the show expand on that topic, but it also brings up other topics of great depth, in a way that they are not actually visible but require some understanding. Each battle in the show has a level of depth and Fullmetal Alchemist is one of those anime which do not hesitate to challenge the violence in the world (even though it has enough of it)\nOn the surface, the story is very interesting and deals with military affairs, science and war. The battles are strategic in nature and emotional 'asspulls' are rare. The story is presented in a way such that it does not waste much time in moving the events along but also makes time for character development even if they are irrelevant to the plot. This makes the characters multi-dimensional and far better than any other show would have normally done.\nWhen it comes to the characters, it must be emphasized how well developed they are. For starters, each character does something that is useful to the plot. I do not mean giving humor to the show or such, but do the smallest of things such as setting traps or acting as decoys, etc. This ensures that no character is wasted or is there just for the heck of it.\nEven minor characters are useful in some way\nThe fact that the show's villains are named after the seven deadly sins adds to the symbolism of the show. What adds to the characters is their character development. Even though one may not realize it, the characters strongly mature and by the end of the show, the viewer can't help but reminisce on how our beloved characters have grown. All this happens without the show reminding us that our characters have grown from when they started. The fact that Edward calls himself \"short\"(recurring joke) may irk fans of the original anime, but it is proof of how much Edward has grown.\nHowever, the alchemy used in the show makes one feel doubtful about it. The alchemy used here is nothing like the one used in real life and it is used more often as magic than as an instrument of science. This really makes one wonder about the plausibility of it. While the core law of alchemy is easily relatable to real life, it's application in the show is not completely proper and is doubtful.\nAs I explained earlier, there was another version of Fullmetal Alchemist released in 2003 which was filler for the most part and covered only a part of the original manga. That part took around thirty episodes in the first anime. This is where another problem of Brotherhood arrives. Brotherhood assumes that the viewer is familiar with the world of Fullmetal Alchemist and hence rushes this part of the story. This creates a problem for newer viewers. Alchemy as a power is not explained properly and the core root of the show is rushed in half an hour. This confuses the newer viewers. As they keep progressing, they get to understand. However, this gives off a bad first impression. This is sad as first impressions are usually (almost always) the main impressions. The alternative is to watch that specified part in the original anime and then switch to Brotherhood.\nNon-violence is one of the important themes in this show. This makes the show less darker than it's actually supposed to be and that causes the change of tone from Fullmetal Alchemist to Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. This even means that the characters are in a far less dangerous situation than they should be. This sadly increases the predictability of the show as no important character actually dies.\nThe ending of Brotherhood was a good ending to most fans of the show. Not me. The ending of the show is good in the sense that it ties up all loose ends of the show. However, the final showdown was quite normal in the sense that it was a DBZ type of ending. The depth and strategy of it did not waver a bit but it pales in comparison to the rest of the show. While I wasn't expecting Ed or Al to turn into Rikudo Sennin times ten (that would've been horrible), it would have been great to challenge the ideals and beliefs of our characters instead of just bringing an OP villain. The finale could have been so much more than just a satisfying ending.\nThe production values of the show are generally high and the technical aspects of the show maintain a high standard. Character designs are usually different for each character and the show pays attention to little details such as Xingese look different from Amestrians, Ishvalans have characteristic red eyes, etc\nThe animation is breathtaking, movements done to perfection and the fight scenes fluid. Where it falters are the backgrounds and scenery. The backgrounds and scenery, usually seen while the characters are travelling, look messy and look like water colour was simply splashed and was then outlined. Other than that, the art remains good.\nThe opening and ending themes generally match the mood of the show. The voice acting in Japanese is perfect. In English, it is not so for some characters' voices don't feel right. However, this factor is subjective and varies from person to person.  The OST's generally match the event to which it correspond to the show and make it more exciting and memorable.  \nOVERALL:-\nAlthough Fullmetal Alchemist suffers from small problems such as the ones listed above, it's depth of story and it's well constructed characters more than make up for it. They turn it into a masterpiece for the world to enjoy.\nThe GOOD\n(+)Depth of story\n(+)Amazing characters\n(+)Sound is perfect(if it matters)\nThe BAD\n(-)First few episodes feel rushed\nThanks for reading my review.

I was denying and avoiding it, but after a friend's consent, I finally sat and took some time watching it.\nOn the beginning of the first episode I was feeling like \"wtf am I watching\", and I was really close to stop watching it.

So, if you think that it's not worth watching for the first few episodes, give it a chance, it gets better.\nEventho it was released in 2009, the animation was quite good actually. The characters, the fights and everything along was pretty well animated, and I wouldn't have changed a thing about it.\nNow, the thing that really made me think this anime was actually one of the best there is out there, is the actual story. I've watched about a 100 anime, and I've never seen a story this good. Once you get in a bit deeper, around the 15th episode, you just get hooked and can't get out of it. Until I reached about the 15th episode, I was literally making myself watch it. After that, it all went so smooth, I couldn't stop it. I finished the rest of the series(about 50 episodes) in about three days. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the characters' background is just amazing. It really is up to the individual to decide which of the characters has the best background, but as I've seen it, all of them are pretty wicked. \nThey've coordinated the soundtracks with the scenes so good aswell, I literally can't point out a single thing about this anime, except that it's a bit slow maybe. But seriously, watching it gave me the experience that just a few other animes gave me, and by that, cheers to FMAB!\n        "},

But, I decided to re-watch it and really liked it.\nSome of the things I really liked (without spoilers):\n1) Every episode is connected and important to the plot. It is quite remarkable that an anime could do this over 64 episodes. \n2) Character development is quite nice. At the end of the series, I could remember the name of several characters and could even briefly describe their personality.\n3) Fights are amazing, especially the ones with Wrath.\n4) Antagonists are really well-developed. I really liked Wrath, Gluttony, Pride (I\n          \n        was kind of terrified of him) and Kimblee.\n5) The main characters (Elric Brothers) are not super-powerful. They do not achieve unreasonable things in their battles just because they are the main characters. They lose whenever the opponent is stronger and the conditions suits the opponent.\n6) Emotions are subtly conveyed. Like when Ed feels responsible and helpless whenever his friends around him suffer,  nobody has to say it, you can just look at him and see what he's going through.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this. I am giving 9 and not 10 because there were some loose ties at the end, like:\n (SPOILER ALERT)\nWhat exactly is the origin of dwarf in the flask and what's its relationship with Truth? How exactly did the souls that Hohenheim scattered return the souls of Amestris' people. \nAnd yeah, the jokes about Ed being short were too repetitive.\n        "},

To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is Alchemy’s First Law of Equivalent Exchange” — Fullmetal Alchemist\nThe quote above is certainly true when one thinks about the adaptation history of Fullmetal Alchemist. As compared to the 2003 version, Brotherhood is vastly different. The former did not follow the source material all the way through and pacing was off, whereas Brotherhood followed the source material from beginning to end, and that is why it’s so great. \nIf one doesn’t at least know the prolouge story of FMA, then they have no business even\n          \n        reading any reviews. Quite simply, Fullmetal Alchemist as a whole is about two brothers who have committed the ultimate taboo of their world and they paid the price for it. So, they desperately try to get what they have lost, but along the way they uncover  truths that they were not ready for.\nThe pacing of Brotherhood started off a bit iffy. In the first ten or so episodes, I felt it being a bit episodic. I mean, sure the first arc was about them uncovering the first batch of hard truths about what really was happening, but to me it felt just a little too episodic. Once it got around episode 11, I think that’s really when the show found its ground floor and it was uphill from there on.\nWhen everything was laid out for us and we were slowly fed what the over-reaching plot was, I couldn’t help but find myself so hooked to the screen episode after episode. Each one just pulled me in closer and closer, made me feel for these characters, made me want to know what was happening next, all the while not wanting to miss a single minute.\nSometimes anime can either bring better art styles to an adaptation than the manga ever did or it could be worse. In Brotherhood’s case, I think it fell somewhere in the middle of all of that. Bones really did do a great job capturing the essence of the art style of Brotherhood while also throwing in their own specific style. From how it all flowed in animation to how all of the fights were so brilliantly created. \nI admit, I only watched the dub, so I can’t compare to how the English dub did as compared to the original subs, but I will say this: Funimation never fails to deliver on a great English dub. All around, the dub had a great cast. I don’t think no single voice actor or actress failed at what role they were given. A few standouts were: James Douglas(Major Miles), Vic Mignonga(Edward Elric), Kent Williams(Father), J. Michael Tatum(Scar), and Colleen Clickenbeard(Hawkeye).  \nAs for the sound effects and soundtrack, I think everything fit well. They timed the right moments with the right tracks. I think certain tracks definitely help set the mood for certain moments while not taking away from said moments. The Ops and Eps definitely were rightly selected. They were great Jrock tracks. I specifically loved the second OP and EP.\nNow to the characters. Such a large, yet wonderful cast of characters. Of course, thorugh it all, Ed and Al are the main focus through the first half. Then, that were we got to know the other characters at least in some bits. I really liked how each main character had their own arc and were given time to develop and grow in their own way. For example, I loved how Scar was able to grow in a way that made sense for him. I also liked how Greed kept on swaying from good to bad. I really felt for him.\nOne standout character through this all was Roy. I loved how his constant arc of the show was a combination of two things: Becoming fuehrer of the country and avenging Hughes. Throughout the entire ordeal of everything going around him, those two main objectives kept his character the most interesting, I think, especially the dark path he took for a few episodes. That really brought the realism of this show full circle and how one decision could set us down the wrong path.\nIn the end of it all, Fullmetal Alchemist finally gets the adaptation that everyone was waiting for. We finally got a proper one -- one that satisfied those  who read the manga all the way through. It might have a few bumps here and there, but Bones showed us -- and other studios I hope -- how to PROPERLY do an anime series that faithfully follows the source material. \nIn any case, it’s a wonderful series that tugs so many heartstrings that we begin to feel like this show’s b-word. \nStory: 10/10\nArt and Animation: 9\nSound, Music, and Voice Acting: 9\nCharacter Cast and Development: 10\nEnjoyment: 10\n"},

One is Hunter x Hunter (2011) and the other is Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, both of which are remakes of much older and incomplete series. Now Hunter x Hunter (2011) is one of my favourite\n          \n        anime of all time and since I was looking for a well regarded Shounen to fill that void, I decided upon this one since it has been recommended to me ever since it started airing. I thought, “why not? If it’s anything like HxH then I’ll be happy to watch it”. Naturally then, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood had a lot to live up to for me regarded as a modern classic, seen as the best Shounen ever created (even better than HxH) and even as the pinnacle of anime. \nOn that I'd have to disagree, but all in all it is a good, solid series that has universal appeal, even outside of the anime community. Although perhaps I set my expectations a little too high; add to this the fact that I've never entertained the original 2003 anime or the manga, and you've got one very tough customer. \nFirstly, the animation and music score are consistently above average and deserve praise; the first opening theme “Again” by Yui, the third opening theme “Golden Time Lover” by Sukima Switch and the first ending theme “Uso” by SID were the visual and musical standouts for me. \nEdward and Alphonse also make a really great pair of main characters given their contrasting personalities; I was surprised to not find myself constantly annoyed by the teenage protagonist and deuteragonist of a Shounen anime since that’s usually the case (sadly). The lack of randomly placed fan service, along with diverse character designs and badass female characters were also plus points for me. They definitely added to the more mature themes of life, death, reincarnation and what it means to be human and sin. Rarely did FMAB feel like a Shounen anime, but only after you reflect upon its message do you realize this.\nAdditionally, by the end, you really do feel a sense of fulfilment when things go right for the Elric brothers; it was so rewarding to see Alphonse get his body back in particular since he’d been struggling for so long without it. Though, despite popular opinion that the anime is nearby perfect, I thought there were quite a few problems when it came to story presentation and characters in particular...although that's just me. For starters, the only relationships that feel “real” and have depth are that of Ed & Al and Mustang & Hawkeye- it’s a good job though, because those are some of the most important in the story. \nI honestly didn't connect with the main cast all that much however, & despite not disliking them I didn't particularly care for them either though I can't put my finger on why. The animation was beautiful, as was the underlying message/moral and music, but it just felt like something was missing. As if there was no real heart in the adaptation & more so just an intrinsic need to plough through the material. Character deaths weren't as impactful as they should've been, and despite having so many episodes there were still a lot of things that I would've liked to have seen from the series.\nMore development for the homunculi, more information about the origins of alchemy itself, definitely more story covering the situation in Xing (that could’ve had a whole damn arc), Trisha and Hohenheim’s relationship, as well as his journey since he was such an important character. How did he meet and fall in love with her? What about his travels throughout his four hundred plus years of life? It’s all just left to the viewers’ imagination, and whilst I don’t particularly like being spoon fed everything, it just feels like a bit of lazy writing and lack of imagination to me. Take Hughes for example, he is a huge motivation to Mustang both in life and in death, but it never truly feels like he is. It’s like the series wanted to wring emotion out of me when he died, but the author didn’t know how to do so in a remarkable and impactful way, so it came off as a little contrived. If we got more depth and time with certain events and characters, then perhaps the series would’ve elicited more emotion out of me because god knows the potential was there.\nSuch things, whilst not exactly necessary to the overarching plotline, are what create those emotional connections, plant those roots and glue the relationships and characters together. And that’s what I feel was missing from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. There were a huge set of colourful and interesting side characters (as well as possible subplots) that never got the spotlight they deserved. Take Greed, Lust, Ling, Olivier, Hughes, Izumi and Kimblee in particular, who are just ploughed through and shoved back into their respective boxes after their initial introductions (only to be brought out now and again). We don’t get time to connect with anything all that much because of how fast paced the story is…things happened- big things- but it never feels like they did. Things never have as much presence as they should, and there are moments where the story feels painstakingly slow and uneventful, despite so many things going on.\nThe series never gave more than what was absolutely necessary and whilst that could be seen as a positive, for me it felt like a bit of the good ol’ wasted potential. The plot was well crafted, and the ideas were great, but at the end of the final episode there was no “wow! That was amazing”, it was more like “well that was nice”.\nSure there was a happy end, but by the time I reached the finish line I realized I hadn’t learned anything about the main characters that I hadn’t known from the very beginning.\nDespite their eventful journey and all of the things they learned and lost, I can’t say there was really many changes within them, and whilst that’s not particularly a bad thing, it just made the outcome and conclusion a little underwhelming for me. At least it got an ending though, which is more than I can say for a lot of other Shounen anime; the problem here is that I think it ended too soon as opposed to being dragged out like many other series’ of the same breadth.\nIn conclusion, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a very good anime that’ll stick with me, but it’s definitely not the best and is by no means as close to the perfection people suggest. There were some standout moments though, especially when it came to Van Hohemheim, and I may or may not feel inclined to throw it into my favourites one day.\n"},

Watched it long ago on TV and know the story but never ALL the episodes until now haha. \nAnyway, rather than a part by part review, this is more of just my thoughts on the series (without giving away spoilers). I wouldn't go as far as to call it a masterpiece, but it is a very solid series. \nWhat I find most interesting is how the paced the story perfectly and the way the plot makes use of science (alchemy), religion, cultural history, the effects of war, human sins and the bonds of family. While\n          \n        many other series uses these too, in my opinion its rare for this amount to blend so well without making a mess, just touching the surface of certain aspects or rushing the plot.\nAlso, I find that there is a sense of reality even within this fictional world as it isn't always up to the two main characters to save the day. Characters from different backgrounds have their chance to shine, such as the childhood friend who has to stand by the sidelines, the few supporting soldiers, foreigners from neighboring countries, or even the wives & civilians. This allows us to know their story and empathize with most of them. And if I may say so, I think they did a good job showing that everyone is a main character in their own story. Even the villains.\nFinally, my favorite subject of the whole series has gotta be how they deal with death though. Loss, pain, moving on, hatred, revenge, forgiving. All were expressed rather well by both main and supporting characters in my opinion. At the end of the day, death is inevitable and we can only learn to accept it and live on.\nIn summary, I really enjoyed the series. ^_^\n        "},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="                          \n    As a manga, Fullmetal Alchemist was met with resounding popularity right from the start, and after only two years of it’s ten year run, the demand for an anime adaptation was overwhelming. Studio Bones took up the production, but with the manga not even a quarter of the way finished, they were left with a pretty big lemon to deal with. Fortunately, they were able to make lemonade by writing an entirely new story using the material they were given. The resulting anime was an immediate success, among fans and critics alike, winding up on more than it’s fair share of top ten lists since\n          \n        then. And yet, despite the fact that it was universally loved and critically acclaimed across the board, there was still heavy demand for a more faithful adaptation. Thus, in 2009, only one year away from the manga’s end, Brotherhood was born.\nFrom an animation standpoint, this show was working with a relatively low budget. This is nothing new, of course... Japanese animation has always used a lower frame rate than American animation, and often look cheaper as a result. Low budgets are fairly common, but what really differentiates is how different shows manage their budgets. By using key frames, speed lines and other useful tricks, you can cut corners where it won’t be noticed, and save your money for the moments that need to move more fluidly. If you do this well, most audiences will never notice the difference. The original series was incredibly good at this, but unfortunately, Brotherhood is not. The key frames are a lot more blatant, as frozen heads can move their lips for several seconds at a time while people in the background just sort of freeze into bluish blobs.\nI rarely ever complain about an anime‘s artwork, as it’s rarely ever a problem for me, but it has to be said... Brotherhood’s artwork is lazy. It is plagued by choppy, jagged outlines. You may not notice it in far shots, but whenever any character has a close-up, it can’t be avoided. The only exception, that I’ve seen, is with it’s openings.\nWhile we’re on the subject of openings, me gusta.  They are all spectacular.\nAs for the English dub, let’s keep this brief. It is every bit as good as the original’s. There are a few changes made, but none of them are bad, and yes, Maxey Whitehead deserves to have a statue built in her honor.\nSo, with all that out of the way, let’s talk about what really matters... The story.\nWhen I first decided to try out this series, a friend of mine warned me that the first few episodes were basically a rehash of the material from the first anime. What she failed to mention is that by a few episodes, she meant the first thirteen, and by rehash, she basically meant cliff notes. Brotherhood gets off to a horrible start, pushing out a pointless Ice-Alchemist episode purely for the sake of fan-service before moving onto the rest of the rushed material. 26 episodes are crammed into thirteen episodes, and by god it feels like it. The pacing is jarringly terrible, the stories are rushed, we get barely any background material devoted to the Elric brothers’ childhood, and key moments of their past are told to us rather than shown to us.\nExample:  Remember how a certain piece of Winry’s backstory was revealed to us in FMA? We opened on Winry, as a child, crying her eyes out at the table while taking her anger out on the boys. Not only were her actions genuinely and believably child like, but it gave serious insight into Pinako’s distaste for the military, and foreshadowed the fate of Trisha Elric. How was this key plot point revealed in Brotherhood? Winry sat next to Hawkeye and told her about it. No emotional impact, just exposition. And that’s just one example. Show, don’t tell, people. This is basic stuff here.\nOne of the biggest problems with the anime is shown right off the bat during these episodes, and never really goes away. From a dramatic standpoint, Brotherhood suffers greatly at the hands of it’s own poorly timed gag humor. Some of the most deep, emotional moments of the series get their serious tone blown away by ugly, unfunny super-deformed moments. Even when the boys are lying on the ground in pieces after an encounter with Scar, they still can’t escape this.\nIn any case, once this little catch-up session is over, the story starts to get a lot better. The pacing finally becomes bearable, as bold new ideas... At least they’re new to those of us who haven’t read that far into the manga... Are introduced. Familiar characters like Kimblee, Scar and Dr. Marco wear out their welcome, but at the same time, a flurry of compelling characters are introduced. Ling Yao, Lan Fan, and May Chang are outstanding, and their arrival placed a stamp of individuality on the show that it frankly didn’t have until then. We’re introduced to the country of Xing and the practice of alkahestry, two concepts that never stop being interesting.\nCertain characters sorely missed, but not so much that we can’t appreciate the presence of Olivier Armstrong, one of the most captivating characters in the entire franchise. A small selection of characters are actually handled and developed better than they were in the original show, with a few examples being Riza Hawkeye and Envy. Some interesting ideas are explored through Gluttony, but I still miss his puppy-dog loyalty to Lust.\nIt's a high point that goes on for a very long time.  To be honest, for a very long stretch of episodes in the middle, I was seriously considering giving this series a solid 8, but then there's the ending... An ending went so far over the top with it's sickeningly happy Disney resolutions that I had to knock it down a point.  I can't really talk about it without giving away spoilers, but this show goes so far to have all good guys win and all bad guys lose that some of the resolutions are just insultingly stupid.\nAll in all, this series was quite disappointing. The first thing anybody says to promote it is that it's faithful to the original manga, but that often feels like more of a restriction than an advantage. With fans world-wide clamoring about it being a masterpiece, I had high expectations for it. It’s not better... Not by a long shot. It never reaches the depth or complexity of the original, but as a stand-alone, it’s still a pretty decent show. It’s got some serious, jarring flaws, but it still brings to life an exciting fantasy adventure that fans of all ages can enjoy.\nI give Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood a 7/10. \n        "},

The Story was good, not great Art was great, but not amazing, an sound is almost none existent. Character's are where the show shines if ever, and thus this  is the reason for the 8 out of ten. Its  because it doesn't do anything bad, but nothing IMO to stand out. Its just god in all Categories, but never Amazing. Personally i like shows to be lob sided, not so well rounded i could play billiards with it. Normally i want a show\n          \n        to have something amazing, but with  flaws, that as whole don't effect the enjoyment, but latter you see them. But then you realize  how amazing the show was because you didn't notice the flaws. Full metal alchemist: Brotherhood does nothing like this.All it does is stay safe, never trying for Greatness, but just sticking with\"good\". Thus Full metal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets an 8/10\n        "},

The animation in this series far surpassed the previous series as well. The shading and deep colors added a rich feel to the environments.\n~Sound~\nWhile I personally am not a fan of dubbed anime, the dubbing on this was alright. I watched most of it in Japanese, and Paku Romi Sensei's performance as Edward was one of the most passionate that\n          \n        I've heard. I don't want to give anything away but if you're near the end of the series I would encourage you to watch in Japanese ^.- !!\n~Characters~\nLemme just address the elephant in the room: Greed. I LOVE Greed! There is not much I can give away about it but let's just say you'll be seeing a lot of him ^.^. The characters have a lot of added depth from the first FMA series and it is definitely quite the task keeping up with all of their back stories (though this is a welcome task ^.~ ). All of the favourites from the first series are back for this action! I know my youngest is partial to Gluttony and her sister is a Scar fangirl.\n~Story~\nThis is where the series shines through. There were many points during the series where I had to pause the DVD to grab tissues. Those who have seen the first FMA series could guess how sad the loss of a beloved character can be. Besides the heartbreaking stuff the story delves deep in to the workings of alchemy in ways that the first series didn't come close to emulating. The series climax is action packed and emotionally charged (might I remind you to watch this in Japanese again? ^-^ ) like the first series but the end to this series is on a more epic scale.\nWatching this series really did feel rewarding for me, as I watched the characters develop, I felt like I was becoming friends with them and was sharing in their triumphs and folleys. I felt like I had been on an adventure myself by the time I was through, and if you have yet to see this I wish you well on your adventure!\n        "},

I'm gonna keep it short since you are probably going to run into a lot of the same praises.\nStory: 10\nA Plot that, in my last review would of been considered an idiot plot but won't because there are a lot of other factors going into what started this whole deal off: pulls you in with lots of emotion, action, and a nice comedy whip topping. Backstories are handled nicely and the plot doesn't stray off from target to much. Also a plot that follows\n          \n        the manga, so there is that.\nArt: 9\nBright, colorful locations mixed with dark dreary set pieces. The art doesn't fuck around. The character designs are also a plus since the studio took the time to carve a lot of detail into each character. And this applies to whether the character is getting damaged or just actively growing. The visual effects are also really nice but some would say can be a bit over the top in some areas.\nSound: 10\nBliss to the ears this OST is. There are five Op's and five Ed's so you will find a couple if not like all of them. The background sounds also really help elevate the emotion with the scene. From dangerous to epic to sad, it all works. Voice acting was also really well done, each character almost like you would think they would as well as how they did in the original run of the show.\nCharacters 10\nI'm starting to sound redundant myself now. Adding in the great design, great voice acting, and great use of story telling, the characters come out to being what really sucks you into the plot. Yuo will find plenty of main characters and side characters that you like.\nEnjoyment: 10\nIT''S GOOD, GO WATCH IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY. which if you haven't where have you been all this time?\nOverall: 10\n        "},

It's up there with Berserk 1997, Code Geass and Parasyte as one of the best anime that I've ever watched. Everything from the characters to the story to the music falls nothing short of amazing.\nStory:\n 2 brothers use human transmutation alchemy to attempt to revive their mother but they fail miserably because they sacrifed an arm, a leg and an entire body for a freaky thing that didn't even look like their mother. And they're on a quest to look for the phollosopher stone to get their bodies back until they... Oh god I could\n          \n        go on and on about the story of this anime but overall it's a deep, emotional and exciting thrill ride from beginning to end in my opinion.\nArt:\n Honestly, the visuals are the weakest aspect of FMA Brotherhood in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't look bad. The animation quality is solid and a lot of the fight scenes are epic and the show isn't afraid to show blood but the show's visuals really isn't anything special in my opinion. I honestly think the 2003 version looks slightly better.\nSound:\n I fucking love the opening and ending songs. 3 of my favorite openings are Again (1st) Chemistry (4th) and Rain (5th) and 3 of my favorite endings are Uso (1st) Let it all out (2nd) and Sentimental Moment (4th) but the others are still great. As for voice acting, well I still have yet to hear the sub but the dub has an outstanding performance. Grant it you might recognize a few voices if you've watched more than 1 dub of other Funimation dubbed anime but the performances and delivery are near spot on.\nCharacters:\n This is what makes the show for me. If I can't enjoy the characters, I can't enjoy the anime and thankfully, FMA has a very layered and interesting cast. From the heroes to the villains to the morally gray characters all of the characters are important in some way and feel very distinct from each other. Great development for a lot of the characters, As well as intrigue on what kind of alchemy/ alche-history each character can perform.\nOverall:\n This anime is fucking amazing! I know everyone now-a-days says that but I don't care. My enjoyment for this anime is through the roof. The story is amazing, the visuals are passable, the music and voice acting is great, the characters are fucking awesome and at no pint was I ever bored from watching this anime. That being said I highly recommend you watch the 2003 version first before watching Brotherhood because the 2003 version has a slightly better beginning and you would get more of an appreciation for Brotherhood as a result.\n        "},

There is a lot depth and emotion\n          \n        to the story from friendship to romance everything is there.\n-Art/Animation : 9 \nThe art is well done, the backgrounds always feels full and the details is amazing animation is good but sometime feels chunky (rarely). The characters are well drawn and are all different it's nice to see a variety of skin color depending on the regions they are from.\n\n-Sound : 9.5\nOne of the best OST that i heard in a long time all the op gives you the chills and the music goes well with every moments and gives you that extra feels in intense action scene. Now for the sounds themselves they are genuine but there is sound that I hate it's the gun shots they aren't realistic enough.\n-Character : 8 \nWe have back story for most of the characters but there is some that i would love to know more like the mother of Al and Ed but i guess you can't have everything. The only homunculus with a lot of back story is greed and wrath but apart from those two almost every other Homunculus is untouched.\n-Enjoyement 10\nReally fun anime i recommend it to everyone who are fans of action and comedy you will not be displeased by the ending :)\n-Overall 9.5\n        "},

Brotherhood has a well-made continuous story which ofc has some flashbacks so the viewer gets more source to the character backgrounds and can understand them better. The smartest thing they did in this story in my opinion is the ending. They applied  their own \"Alchemy\" -law and took advantage of it. Ending doesn't have to be a tragic to be good -\nIshval\n          \n        Civil War gives depth to army veterans.\nFort Briggs serves as a some kind of side story which has a meaning when approaching the end and the story OVERALL. \nPersonally I feel that the story is really something that takes you to the World of Alchemy. It's not all about happiness, sadness or jokes. This feels somehow realistic. Story wasn't predictable and especially the ending.\nPacing is really good like mentioned above.\n10/10\n\nArt: Character hairs are little bit natural and the animation gives off this \"realistic\" kind of vibe. Through the episodes art felt solid and did not get worse. Background/scenery are simply breathtaking.  [Not Garden of Words level but FMA: Brotherhood is older]. On the other hand I don't feel that the houses/objects had that much of details.\n9/10\nSound: This is one of the aspects where Brotherhood shines. Every OP and ED are EXCELLENT. To be honest I don't listen to ED:s but Brotherhood was one of those anime where I watched OP:s and ED:s. My favorite OP:s are 1 and 4. Very compelling songs. [Fav. ED 5 and 4] Background themes/osts are also pure gold, they enhance emotions, action and strokes of a wit! Characters voice sounds very natural and pleasing, the definitely know how to do the voice acting!\n10/10\n\nCharacters: Side characters are excellent, they may even tell little bit of background story about other characters so the viewer understands why he and she does this and acts like that. Every character has their flaws and strengths like in real life and no one seemed unusually strong. Elric brothers also make character progression when they get to know other people hard/tough backgrounds and empathize to them. While on journey Elric brothers find sadness, despair, happiness and you can feel their emotions. Villains for once had a \"real\" motivation to do things their way and background was added for depth. Scar is one of the early villains seen in the anime and they built pretty good background story which wasn't separate to some other characters background. \n10/10\nEnjoyment: After I have done this review I feel like watching Brotherhood for the 3rd time. IT just never gets old. Even though I have watched it, I watch some parts from the anime from time to time. I have also put OP:s in my Youtube playlist. When characters/people feel sad or are ready stand up after failure it just keeps you motivated and reflects those feelings. \nMy sister who wasn't a fan of anime watched this with me because in our childhood we saw FMA on TV. Even though some time has passed I can still remember some scenes well.\n10/10\nOverall: What can you expect from an Anime that has done story very-well, put depth to characters and made excellent songs? At the cost of 64 episodes is little when compared to what has been achieved! I hope some unmentioned anime would increase their episodes so they can built a good story and \"world\", though I'm not entirely sure if it would work..."},

I was one and I think I can say that this anime overwhelmed our expectations...\nIndeed, the screenplay, which follows that of the manga, is exceptional. It is not for nothing that the name of Arakawa is known, Fullmetal Alchemist is an outstanding Shonen of these recent years.  If the first adaptation was not transcendent, it was particularly because of its too dopey scenario, which did not render homage to the complexity of the manga. This\n          \n        second adaptation, in contrast, shows a world torn between soldiers abusing their power and a population that asks only to live in peace. Some particularly poignant scenes worth seeing. \nThe characters are more thorough, their psychology, more complex. Their feelings are deeper, and they evolve gradually. Some of their relations, as the ratio between Mustang and Lieutenant Hawkeye, or brotherhood of Edward and Alphonse are particularly well treated. But this is not the case for all. Thus the love between Edward and Winry barely moving, and it is regrettable that their report is not conducted further.\nThe graphics are in the same vein as that of the manga: sweet, nice, colorful and fluid. The soundtrack is good taste, even if it does not carry us completely, though some opening (the latter in particular) and ending are very successful.\nTo sum up, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a must see, despite its some defects; a pearl as we would like to see more often, with a scenario that alone is worth a visit. The work of Arakawa, the woman who managed to win in the male world of shounen you full of surprises. Now, go watch this RIGHT NOW !\n        "},

I wasn't left with any questions, I didn't desire any further detail or explanation of events, I didn't need any more character development.

Everything was well laid out.\nThat being said, I'm not sure if it really is worthy of the #1 ranking spot. Top 10, definitely.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Dont get me wrong This is a Masterpiece But Only One Anime has ever gotten a 10 from ME!!\nStory\nWhen I first heard that a new series of Fullmetal Alchemist was to hit our screens in spring 2009, I admit that I approached it with trepidation. I loved the 2002 version, thought it ended well and, after believing the film had ruined it somewhat, I was praying that a second season wouldn’t besmirch the franchise any further. When I learned that this new anime was a re-telling that actually sticks to the manga’s plot, I was suddenly much more interested.\nWhile initially it’s easy to fall into\n          \n        the trap of constantly comparing the first Fullmetal Alchemist with Brotherhood, when it really picks up, those thoughts soon disappear. Although the earlier part of the series speeds ahead at double the pace of 2002 – putting into ten episodes what FMA draws out for twenty-five – the plotline itself is far from hurried. Instead, Brotherhood finds the perfect balance of action-packed instalments with slower sections to develop the narrative. Certainly, the Nina arc in 2002 feels more fully fleshed-out, twice as disturbing, and far more heartbreaking, and yes, in contrast it seems rushed in this new incarnation. So, while I missed that chance to cry like a little girl, in the grand scheme of things that one event becomes much less important than everything else that follows, and it would have been to the detriment of later events had that arc been stretched out any longer.\nHowever, what really gets your knickers wet with excitement is the developing narrative and its accompanying action. The show chops out all of the extraneous fluff (albeit good fluff) that the first series had and not only links together the individual plot threads, but expands its scope to cover more of Amestris’ territory and beyond, thus developing the world further and emphasising the horrific threat posed by the homunculi. Alongside this comes an assortment of arse-kickingly awesome fights. Brotherhood doesn’t hold back and really packs its punches with far more brutal violence than its predecessor. Blood splatters from every direction, people get impaled, sliced, shot in the head, and burned to a crisp – all in gloriously animated detail. While not excessively gory or sadistic, this unsubdued approach to fighting makes each battle all the more exciting to watch, while adding a contextual sense of realism. This all results in a story that feels so damn epic you’ll be watching episodes in the thirties thinking that it can’t get any better… until you get to the forties… and then the fifties…\nMy only minor quibbles with Brotherhood’s plot stem from two things. Firstly comes the somewhat unnecessary re-cap with Hohenheim sitting around a fire re-counting the various events thus far in episode twenty seven. Such episodes generally feel rather pointless (unless the audience is particularly dense or the narrative ridiculously convoluted), but aside from that, they also ruin the show’s pacing. Secondly, is that due to skipping the Youswell coalmines arc, Yoki’s presence seems somewhat downplayed. While the incident receives vague explanation in the form of flashback, and sure he’s not a major character, it would have been better to dedicate an episode to this arc and make more sense of his existence within the plot – heck, it would have been a much better use of twenty-four minutes than the summary.\n\nAnimation\nBrotherhood must have had a rather large production budget, as the animation is sumptuous and at times literally breathtaking. Smooth movement and nicely detailed backgrounds complete with an almost painterly texture effect make the series truly pleasurable to watch. When it comes to action sequences, there are no cutting corners with cheesy action lines, or ‘epic still shotz of awesomez’. No, instead Ed, Al and the gang jump, hop, and dash across the screen with a veritable eyegasm of dust clouds at every rock fall and sparks flying as metal clashes against (full) metal.\nIn the same manner as the rest of the visuals, Bones does a glorious job of animating blood. One particularly striking shot shows a tear falling onto a drop of the carmine liquid on Lin’s cheek, and the subtlety showing the two fluids merge, with the crimson tone watering down ever so slightly, is simply dazzling. From jets projecting themselves across the screen as characters are slashed by swords, to a large pool gradually oozing from beneath a fallen corpse, as much care has gone into these details as into Ed’s rapid fighting movements.\n\nSound\nAccompanying the beautiful animation and kick-ass plotline comes a gorgeous orchestral soundtrack with brass notes through to softer string melodies reflecting the series’ wide variety of moods. While choral tracks – courtesy of the Warsaw Philharmonic Choir – enhance the haunting nature or dramatic revelations of certain scenes, tribal tones add an extra pace to busier action sequences to fully round out an altogether stunning soundtrack.\nBrotherhood’s voice actors provide superb performances all around with each seiyuu capturing their character’s personality and mood exceptionally well. Sure I could knock off a mark for cheesy commercial bumper guy whose annoying voice belts out ‘Fullmetal Alchemist’ week after week, but it’d be like saying the best day of your life was ruined by having to take a leak at lunchtime.\n\nCharacters\nFullmetal Alchemist has always boasted two of the strongest protagonists in any anime or manga. Ed has a lot of the stereotypical heroic qualities, such as immense power, a hot head and a rash attitude, which could work against him, except he counteracts these with visible weaknesses. He tries to act tough but gives in to fear and despair, and he has a very short fuse when it comes to his height complex – something that not only highlights his imperfections, but also provides a lot of the comedic content. On top of this, the fullmetal boy goes on a massive learning curve as he finds out the truth behind everything he thought he knew, maturing with each new and horrific revelation. He doesn’t glorify or try to skip over his past actions; instead he attempts to atone for his sins without having others pay for his mistake, all of which makes him more compelling to watch than a vapid hero vowing to save the world.\nIn the same vein, Al could easily fall into the trap of becoming “the nice one”; he’s generous, kind, patient and likes small animals – doesn’t sound too interesting when you put it like that, does he? However, he has one massive metallic reason for avoiding this pitfall: his lack of physical body. Spending his life as a soul in an empty suit of armour gives the young boy a melancholy that makes him so much more intriguing. Suddenly, all of his positive attributes seem brave, and if he does break down, or show weakness or anger, it becomes all the more powerful.\nWhile Ed and Al could carry the story themselves, the show’s supporting characters prove just as memorable as its protagonists. For an anime boasting such a large overall cast, Brotherhood develops its varied individuals exceptionally well; in particular, the fact that the Elric brothers aren’t the only heroes certainly helps this. A lot of the biggest battles are either joint efforts, with multiple allies ganging up on their foe, or permits one of the secondary characters to momentarily claim the limelight for themselves. With multi-faceted personalities, no one feels flat, dull, or a waste of the space they take up on screen. Allowing for plenty of evolution in both its protagonists and antagonists, the series accords reasonable motive behind everyone’s actions, which ultimately makes the audience care and certain deaths all the more poignant – whether through genuine upset (and full on gushing waterfalls of tears) at a fatality or the shock that you actually feel a upset at a bad guy’s demise.\n\nOverall\nI’d love nothing more than to just yell “WATCH IT, WATCH IT NOW! STOP SCRATCHING YOUR BUTT AND PRESS PLAY!” over and over for a thirteen hundred words, but as a reviewer, you must try to suppress your inner fanboy/fangirl for fear of over-rating a show purely because you love it. As such, dishing out a high overall score is not an easy undertaking, but Brotherhood genuinely deserves this praise. Overall, it provides a little over twenty-five and a half hours worth of pant-wettingly epic entertainment. With a gripping plot, consistently glorious animation, a beautiful and befitting orchestral soundtrack, and a full, well-rounded cast, this anime remains one of the best series that I have seen to date, and I’m pretty certain that it’ll be a long time before I see anything this good again.\n9.8/10\nstory\n 10/10\nanimation\n 10/10\nsound\n 10/10\ncharacters\n 9.9/10\noverall\n        "},

The original Fullmetal Alchemist was a good series that many enjoyed. Of course the ending and subsequent movie rubbed me the wrong way. But, I don’t think anyone can say it was a bad decision to go back and remake the series following the original\n          \n        manga to the finish. The problem for the first Fullmetal Alchemist was that it started back in 2003. For those who didn’t know the manga finished alongside Brotherhood which ended in 2010. That is a lot of material that the original series could never cover. The only options available to Fullmetal Alchemist was doing an original story or stopping and waiting. Regardless of how that decision turned out that left a lot of material untouched and thus more than enough reason to do a remake. Of course if there is one thing I’m glad they remade the series for it was the EdxWinry relationship. The thing that didn’t really even happen in the original series with how it ended. This time it was done right and you are left smiling at the end.\nOf course the story wasn’t simply about these two brothers. At the core of it was Hohenheim, who was so critical to events. They condensed his history into an episode, but one can imagine the kind of life he had to lead. You could really feel sympathy for all the suffering he endured, but by the end he was proud of the life he lead.\nIt can just continue on with characters like Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Scar, Greed, Ling Yao, May Chang, etc. In terms of characters Brotherhood gets an A+ if I could since there were so many good ones that anyone who watches the series could have different top 5s. In terms of action a lot of characters outside the main leads got serious battles. Characters from Mustang to Ling had some great fights that are easy to remember even after the series has ended. In terms of serious battles it wasn’t like the leads did all the work at all. The best fights in the series probably would go to Mustang and Wrath. They received so many GAR moments it’s hard to believe. I liked how many of the characters really had their motivations tapped into so we could understand where they were coming from. Mustang had the desire to change the country and protect everyone while the powerful motivation to avenge Hughes also drove him on. Ling and May had the future of their respective clans on the line in the battle to curry favour with the Emperor of Xing and become Emperor or Empress. Everyone had things that were driving them forward and the main characters were just part of the whole thing. It’s not like you didn’t care about the leads since they were well developed, but you could care about other characters and no one would fault you.\n"},

This anime has good character development and a greater view of the world that the brothers live in. Like its predecessor, the themes of sacrifice, hardship/struggle, risk, maturity, morality and death are still ever present.\nDub or Sub?: Both. Although, I do find the English dub team to be the greater of the two. Each voice actor sounded like they were born for their roles.\nStory/Characters (10/10): Okay, where do I even start? If you've seen\n          \n        the first Fullmetal Alchemist then you know the situation I'm in when writing this review.\nThe Story: The story is centered around the grand adventure of Elric Brothers. If I say anymore, it will just spoil the show since there are no filler episodes.\nThe Elric Brothers: The Brothers, Edward and Alphonse, are on a quest of both atonement and discovery. Over the course of the show, the brothers are forced to grow up fast when they faced many problems that challenge their morals and ideals which govern their actions. Along their journey they meet many people who either help or hinder their quest. Eventually, they will later find that their problems are not the only ones that need fixing.\nThe Supporting Cast Members: consist of over 30 characters so I'm not even going to get started on describing them all. Lets just say that they are all good in their own right.\nArt/Animation (10/10): The art/animation is modern. So there's not much to complain about.\nSound/Music (10/10): The sound/music was good. The opening and ending theme songs were acceptable for my taste.\nEnjoyment (10/10): I thoroughly enjoyed it. This anime is a must watch for everyone.\nSummary/Overall (10/10): The story is great. The character development is great (considering the number of characters involved) and the amount of satisfaction is enormous. After that, feel free to watch the side-story Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos.\nReview #7\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Highest rated anime on the website? I don't know about that. I personally like the first series better. Check out my review of it if your interested. But despite that, still like this series just fine.\nStory 8/10\nThe main plot is still the same as the first series, but since this follows the manga a lot more closely, there are different elements to the story. Mostly with Hohenheim and his backstory with Truth. Not to mention new characters introduced, such as May and Ling, as well as axing out characters from the first series such as Dante and Wrath. Despite the differences, it's still FMA. The\n          \n        two brothers commit a taboo with alchemy to bring back their dead mother, doesn't work, they try to get their bodies back to normal, join a military to get a philosopher's stone, blah blah. Same thing, you get the point. The story is told very well with it being engaging and heartfelt just like the first series. Parts of it get complex, but that makes it much more fun to watch rather than easy and boring. It's also very original too, not feeling like it's too similar to any other anime. As for flaws though and why I think the first series is better, it's the pacing. The first series took it's time to tell the story, while with Brotherhood, the first 20 or so episodes rush through to get to the new stuff. Some could argue it's cutting out filler, but it seems to go by too quickly for me personally though. Also, I prefer the ending in the first series. Without spoiling too much for either series, the first one had a darker tone to it and the ending, while sad, felt more real. In Brotherhood, it's one of those endings where things work out for everyone which is unrealistic, the romance was fanservice, and the way Ed and Al got their bodies back was BS. But that's just my general opinion. Can't explain too much into detail though without spoiling.\nCharacters 9.5/10\nAt the very least, the characters here are better than in the first series. For the most part though. The new characters they have are likable and well developed. Bonds between characters are still strong as they were in the first series. Old characters such as Ed, Al, Winry, Mustang, Hawkeye, Hughes, etc. are still as well developed and likable as they were in the first series. To be expected, Shou Tucker is still the worst thing to ever exist. Hughes and Armstrong are still funny. Hawkeye and Mustang are still badasses, and not to mention we get another badass, Olivier Armstrong. Flaws? The homunculi aren't as interesting as they were in the first series. With that one, they had emotions and felt more pitiable and human. In Brotherhood, they're kinda just evil to be evil and that's it. Still, it has strong characters nonetheless.\nAnimation 10/10\nNo doubt that the animation is absolutely fantastic here. Fluid fight scenes, still has cool looking homunculi, and the character designs stay true to the initial look. Behind the gate is awesome looking as well. Setting is still distinctive and original. The animation in the OPs are amazing as well. And just like the first series, the quality just gets better and better. I have no problems with the animation whatsoever. 10/10\nSound 9/10\nJust like in the first series, great English dub with emotion and fitting the characters perfectly. The OPs are also very memorable and some of the best anime OPs out there. Again it's a matter of taste which ones are better. I like all the opening songs, except for the last one. Kinda boring and doesn't fit the last part of the series IMO. The rest are great though. Unpopular opinion, but my favorite is the third one. To compare the OPs to the first series, I'd say the first series has better songs, but just by a hair. Others could say it's about even. Again, it's all a matter of taste.\nOverall 9.1/10\nA-\nGreat series and worth checking out, but I'd watch the first series first so you can get an appreciation for it. If you jump into Brotherhood, you won't like the first one. Which is a shame because the first one was really good. Better than Brotherhood for me. Most people like this one though since it follows the manga while the older version deviates midway. As someone who hasn't read the manga and is judging from an entertainment standpoint, the first one I recommend to watch before this.\n        "},

It uses REAL LIFE physics and energy to create what they call \"alchemy,\" a divine source holding balance by a law of equivalent exchange, to earn something, you need to sacrifice something of equal value, which makes it so there cannot be \"gods\" who can do what they desire, but theres a magical substance called the \"philosophers stone\" which allows you to disobey it, which nearly drives most of the story,\nin the end I believe I would rank this anime #2, right below Hunter X Hunter 2011, which is amazing and very similar from the action to humor, character deveopment, physics, and system itself. \n        "},

Is it justified or is it just another case of MAL users upvoting their favorite series for no reason? Let's take a look.\nReleased in 2011, Brotherhood acts as a more direct and faithful adaptation to the original manga. This was most likely done to appease the fans of the manga who didn't care much for the divergent story in the original 2003 anime. Now, as much as I liked the 2003 anime, it had quite a few\n          \n        flaws. After they went in a separate direction from the manga, the 2003 anime took a heavy nosedive. The plot became unfocused and it ultimately felt like a small story taking place in a massive setting. A lot of plot elements didn't click correctly, Wrath was fucking obnoxious, the ending was abrupt and rushed. It wasn't quite a masterpiece, but it was still really good. Then along comes 2011's Brotherhood and as you can probably tell, I think Brotherhood is significantly better than the 2003 anime.\nBrotherhood's story was focused, logical, had heart and emotion, was well executed, gave depth to every character that needed it and some that didn't, and even addressed some of the more annoying plot issues that the original anime had (and even some that were in the manga!) Every opening and closing song is great and fits the tone of the current arc, and personally my favorites were \"Again\" by Yui, and \"Let It Out\" by Miho Fukuhara. The soundtrack is unbelievable and carries a very emotional tone to the visuals, which are nothing short of great.\nThe great visual direction of the 2003 anime carries over to Brotherhood, with for the most part improvements in animation. The original's art style was a bit bland and dated poorly, but Brotherhood has a more timeless and comforting look to it that sets it apart. The only real problem I have it Envy. Envy's 3-dimensional animation for his true form is nothing short of unsightly. Putting 3D animation in a show like this is fine, so long as you don't do it once. That's because it will stick out horribly and look completely unnatural. Sure enough, it looks completely unnatural and ugly. Still though, nearly flawless. \nAs far as characters go, Brotherhood once again shines. Every character, even the \"evil\"* characters, are somewhat relate-able, understandable, and/or likable. I put an asterisk next to evil because Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of those clever little shows that knows that there is no such thing as good or evil. Every character's motivations and actions are clearly presented outside the childish realms of good and evil, so that every event feels real and the result of true human conflict. What would be a mustache twirler in any other show is a complex character with interesting traits and understandable motivations in Brotherhood.  \nWhat I consider to be Brotherhood's greatest strength is its heart and emotion. I mean no hyperbole when I say I cried for the entire last 2 episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Seeing every arc come together flawlessly and bring the anime to a close was absolutely beautiful, and it wasn't just the characters that held such powerful emotional weight. I was crying partially because I didn't want it to be over. It was too perfect and I couldn't believe it was over because I was enjoying it too much. I should say too that the list of things that have made me cry is a pretty short. It consists of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Pay It Forward, (some movie I can't remember at the minute), and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. So to say that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood carries emotional weight is a massive understatement, as it is not only intelligent, but made with real heart and it shows.\nI don't give 10s out very often in any format, but Brotherhood most certainly has earned its mark. While the 2003 anime was very good and still outshines most other shonen, Brotherhood feels like the Fullmetal Alchemist series is just taking a victory lap. It's so good that it's practically unfair to even label it a shonen. It can appeal to anyone and everyone, and in my opinion, is virtually flawless.\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood earns a 10/10.\n        "},

The pain, the joy, the agony; everything Ed and Al felt, I felt too. I don't know if it's just me, but I bonded with this show. When my greatest fear came, the final episode, I was startled. I couldn't have picked a better ending for my favorite anime. I don't think anyone could have. It left me with a feeling I can't quite explain. It wasn't just one feeling. It was joy, sadness, nostalgia, happiness, pleasure, satisfaction, all fused together as one. It's a rare feeling. I spent months watching this show. It was all worth it. I wouldn't change a thing.\nI wish I had the power to erase my memory. That way, I would erase the memory of watching it, then I would watch it again and again and again, and I would experience the same feeling, exactly like the first time.\nAll hail the king of Anime!

I've rewatched it almost 5 times now, and those epic moments keep getting to me, every single time. Not to mention, it's godlike status in the western world is well deserved, given how STELLAR the dub is. Ever heard Vic Mignogna as Edward Elric? 'Nuff said.\nThe graphics don't deserve\n          \n        any complains. They do the job well. The story is certainly a little stereotyped and slightly predictable, but the series unique approach to this age old plot is part of what makes it so special. There are those few moments that make you go WOW, even if you see them coming.\nThe audio track is, in my opinion, the one of the best I've encountered to date; only Attack on Titan can compare. It contributes SO MUCH to how well rounded the storytelling aspects and the dub are. The openings are the sort that you set as your ringtone. They're up there with \"A Cruel Angel's Thesis\" and \"Guren no Yumiya\".\nEven when the characters hit a roadblock when they're personas become ones that have been done to death, they're all kept alive by occasionally fun and occasionally deep portrayals that have you relating and remembering every last character. Even when they aren't great, you can't get enough of some of them. This is proven by how crashingly this show portrays the Saddest Death in All of Anime.\nWatch the series, watch it dubbed, put some commitment, and it will forever stand out for you in the anime world. It never truly strikes me as much of an anime, as it always comes to my mind initially as a TV series, one of the best and most memorable series, animated and otherwise, that I have EVER watched.\nEven when you can't thoroughly appreciate some of this anime's aspects, you can't help but hammer in that 10 or that top spot because of how memorable it is, and how many times you are ready to happily watch it all over again.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    I absolutely adore this show. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a series that I'll never get tired of. The characters, the plot, the fights, all of it is timeless in my eyes.\nThe story is something I feel is very untouched, especially since the plot revolves around an actual type of science. The beginning three or four episodes may feel a bit rushed to some viewers but eventually it slows down to a pace where significant progress is made each episode with very well done pacing. Almost everything in this show foreshadows something else to come, weather it just be a quote or something a character observes.\n          \n        There are so many twists and turns that it's near impossible to guess what's going to happen. They give you just the right amount of information to create a well written mystery.\nOf course a well written story isn't much if the characters in it aren't also well written. Fortunately the characters in this show are all memorable and interesting, in many different aspects. Something at this show does especially well is villains. Each of the main villains are all so different and intimidating in their own ways. While one villain's size is terrifying, as a contrast another one is just as, if not more, intimidating by simply being in a room with the main protagonists. The overall antagonist in this series is one of my favorites in all of anime. The intelligence, the power, the mystery, this is an all around great main villain. The heroes in this series are also very well written. The development of some takes over half the show to be even close to be complete, and it all pays off to create amazing co-stars. Taking a look at the main protagonists, the Elric Brothers, these are easily two of the best siblings in anime as well as other genres of television. There is a very strong and believable family relationship between them in many more ways than one. One character that outdoes the two brothers in terms of being well written is none other than their own father, Hohenhiem. Just saying one thing about his past would soil his character arc. Overall each character is original and believable in their own way, staying away from repetitious arcs such as \"someone died, now I'm evil\" with one exception, which is developed and improved dramatically. Everyone has a drive, some simple, some complex, but all of them well done.\nThe art style is very beautiful, especially the locations such as Resembool and Fort Briggs. Color plays a key role in setting mood in this sometimes very dark and grotesque world. Lighting is very dynamic, showing very strong shadows for characters going through certain arcs and parts of life. The characters all have different looks and clothing making them easily distinguishable. There are however occasional quality drops but towards the end of the series these are very scarce. Music is also a very nice tone setting element with each song sounding like an orchestral piece. Some of these songs do get repeated quite a few times but if you're watching the show for your first time I can't see it being too noticeable or annoying. Many of the sound effects fit very well with situations and often give scenes that extra push, weather it be dramatic or silly. The official Funimation dub of this show is one of their best in my opinions. If you don't enjoy dubs, that's fine, but I suggest if you do try only one, try this one.\nThe flaws of this series often resolve themselves over time. The true momentum of this show, where I found myself not wanting the episodes to end, was about episode 25. That's not to say anything before that isn't as good, that's just the point where I began to watch until I could barely hold my eyes open. I would love to give this show a perfect ten, but I will say it has it's flaws, few they may be. This is my favorite anime of all and I strongly suggest it to anyone who likes mystery, strong characters, and great fight scenes.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the anime that covers the events of the manga where as the previous anime branched off onto a different story line. What it definitely improves on is the pacing where the original anime felt rushed, this series seems to have paced out the events a lot better and it does not feel like they were trying to go through an entire story arc in the last couple of episodes. The events that occur help carry the story through. What ultimately harms it is that there are some things that are left unexplained and their answer is simply the power of the\n          \n        human will or the power of the human soul.\nOne thing I really liked about this series was the art. At no point did it go through a strange art shift that made everything seem off and awkward. What I really liked though was the effects of objects created with alchemy. The characters often created objects with alchemy that had uneven patterns. At first I thought it was strange, then I figured out that it was a brilliant idea as it allowed you to distinguish the difference between some objects created with alchemy and objects that were created through other means.\nThe voices of the Japanese cast was very good. I never felt annoyed by their voices. One of the problems with this series is that the music was never something memorable for me. I remember the events and the characters of the story, but the music was always something that was in the background that I never took notice of. The sound matches nicely with the events and do not feel awkward at least.\nThe characters were great in this series and many of them were well developed. Nearly all of the major characters receive some sort of flashback that tells you more about them without killing them off. This helped a lot in the development of characters and establishing the atmosphere and motivations of characters in the series. It was done very well compared to some of the other series out there.\nOverall, I felt that this series was pretty good for a Shounen series. Considering the amount of brainless overpowered main characters out there, this was one of the few that strayed a little from that formula in order to give us something different. Though the characters do suffer from a tragic past, the main characters rarely beat their opponents through brute force and willpower. We learn a lot about the primary villain and numerous characters receive a fair amount of screen time that helps develop the characters further.\n        "},

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is it's sequel (or is it) and fixes every flaw that it's prequel had. \nThere is a lot about FMA Brotherhood that makes me want to watch it. One if it is it's complex yet simple story. Two boys lose their bodies trying to bring back their mother so they try to get it back by studying alchemy. Easy, right. but there's so much more to FMA Brotherhood then just getting some bodies back. As this anime goes into more detail the viewer realizes everything in this anime works together\n          \n        in some way. That's what makes the story so fascinating and watchable.  \nBefore I watched FMA I had no idea that there existed an anime company called Bones. Now I do and whatever they release I watch. Something special about Bones is their animation. The animation for FMA Brotherhood is meant to be the way it is. Bones did an amazing job in figuring out what works in this anime. \nThere is a lot of different sounds in FMA Brotherhood. Some of them are repetitive, especially in fight scenes, but they never get old. There is also a lot of older types of music in this anime like 1930's jazz and waltz. \nEd and Al are your main characters in this anime and if you watch this anime you will like either Ed or Al or both. I haven't met a person yet that hates both of them. Other character like Roy Mustang are also very amusing.\nFor me the enjoyment factor in this anime was great. I couldn't wait for the next episode to come out so I can watch it. I'm sure if your a person that loves shounen you will love this anime. And if your looking for an anime that is really in depth and is fast paced then you should definitely give this anime a go. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    The original Fullmetal Alchemist anime was one of the first anime series I ever watched. I remember seeing glimpses of it when I was younger, but the story did not pull me in or appeal to me as much as Inuyasha did at the time. It was years later, when I was thirteen, that I finally did watch it and I fell in love. However, at the time, I didn't have much to compare it to, having never read the manga. When I heard that Brotherhood was coming out, I rushed off to read the manga and got up-to-date with it before Brotherhood started and\n          \n        continued to stay up-to-date on both the manga and Brotherhood. \nTwo years after these have both ended, I have re-watched the series several times, and every time I rewatch it, it never loses any appeal nor do I ever find any serious faults with it. It's a wonderful story of love and loss, pain and grief, family and friendship and put together, it makes for a very touching and compelling story about two brothers who attempt to make the best of a situation they brought on themselves by performing human transmutation as well as regain what they have lost as a result. Coupled with a wide variety of characters, all amazing in their own way, it makes for a truly amazing tale that can have you laughing one moment and crying the next. \nI've read many conflicting views on both series; some say there was little to no character development in Brotherhood as compared to the original, others say Brotherhood moved too fast and wasn't as a deep of a story. I personally prefer Brotherhood to the original and here is why:\nEdward Elric seems a lot more grown up in Brotherhood. In the original (now that I've seen Brotherhood and can compare the two), he is a bit whiny and annoying. My personal favorite character is the homunculus Envy, as disliked of a character he is, I believe he is a much deeper and well-developed character than he is given credit for in both series. Brotherhood's storyline seems much more thought-out and in the end, it has a much deeper message than the original. \nThe first few episodes of Brotherhood are covering what happened in the original up to the point where it diverged from the manga and while it is rushed, I was okay with it because I wouldn't want to sit through ~30 episodes of stuff I have already seen. I feel that even though it was rushed, it got the story across just as effectively, not to mention it left more room for the plot to unfold and progress at a more natural pace. I also think the animation is lot better and more appealing to look at. \nThe story has a great ending whereas with the original, you had to watch the movie Conqueror of Shamballa to get some real closure. I do believe that some characters in Brotherhood were killed off too soon and could have received more character development - a particular homunculus being a prime example, if you've seen the anime already I'm pretty sure you'll know who but I'm trying not to be spoilery.\nBut in the end, I wholeheartedly believe Brotherhood far surpasses the original and the original hardly even compares. I recommend that everyone watches both, but don't be surprised if you end up preferring Brotherhood. \n"},

Not only did they score one television anime based (for the most part) on Hiromu Arakawa's amazing manga series, but the same studio who made that one, Bones, decided to later do an even longer series based even closer to the manga. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was one of those things that I thought was just going to be summarily dismissed as a novelty for the manga readers. I personally didn't care whether there was an accurate version of the manga in anime form. I loved (and still love) the first series and movie, and if I want the\n          \n        manga's story, I can read the manga. Fortunately, Brotherhood was damn good enough to keep watching from beginning to end, and it isn't necessarily because this show is significantly superior to the first (it isn't at all), but because it's just a very good show in itself. \nSo, basically, the story is a quest of restoration. The Elric brothers lost their bodies and are looking for a way to regain those things. The journey of the Elrics takes them to various places, meeting various people, and with various plot twists and turns, ultimately leading them to the final confrontation with said Big Bad, and somehow regaining (most of) what they lost. \nMy one objection to the treatment of the narrative is that, much like in the original manga, it relies on these big sensational \"moments\", which are cool to read/watch, but ultimately take away from the verisimilitude of the work as a whole. All you end up getting are a bunch of puncuations that take away from the subtlety of the themes. \nFor the most part, we get a variety of interesting, and examined characters. The short-tempered but honest Edward and his more composed brother Alphonse. The ambitious and snarky Roy Mustang. His loyal subordinates. The over-the-top, larger-than-life Alex Louis Armstrong and his vicious, tough-as-nails older sister, Olivier Mira Armstrong. The affable, but wicked Greed (my favorite character). The king of trolls, Envy. The badassery-oozing-from-every-pore King Bradley. The adorable May. The butt monkey Yoki. The distant father with the weight of the world on his shoulders, Hohenheim. Some great characters. \nThe art and animation in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is pretty good, and what one would expect of an anime of this generation. The character designs are much closer to Hiromu Arakawa's art in Brotherhood than they were in the original series. The backgrounds and foregrounds can be quite beautiful, if oddly like watercolor paintings at times.The animation is mostly pretty good, though there are times when it noticeably isn't, and it's pretty clear certain episodes have a much higher quality animation than others. \nA large part of bringing the characters alive in an animated television series or movie is the voice acting. In the manga, you just imagine the voices, but in animation, voices are provided, and ideally, these are voices that you will closely associate with the characters, so a strong cast is valuable. Fortunately, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has an excellent cast.\nThe music in this series is excellent. Senju makes use of sprawling, almost pastoral, European-sounding tracks, establishing leitmotifs and conjuring up very operatic pieces for the most dramatic moments in the series.\nIt's not a flawless series, mind you. It seems overly drawn out at times, there are a few plot snags, some characters I don't care for, and adaptation missteps (Dublith/Greed arc, the Ishbal massacre). But, on the whole, looking at the big picture, it's absolutely more than just the sum of its parts\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    After losing their mother, two young boys commit their world's most taboo act; trying to revive the dead. This costs the older brother his left leg, and the younger brother his entire being. The older brother sacrifices his right arm to bind the younger's soul to a suit of armor. Their experiment fails, and the thing they create in the act is nothing short of a monster.\nDetermined to find a way to get their bodies, the older brother replaces his missing limbs with mechanical substitutes and signs up with the military, as a soldier. Thus begins a journey into the hallowed secrets of alchemy, and\n          \n        the schemes that resulted in the nation they serve.\nThis is the premise of Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I feel that I should take the time right now to establish a few key points about this review. Brotherhood's English dub has not been fully released yet, and I do not generally enjoy watching a series in Japanese for various reasons. That said, while I did watch the latter half of Brotherhood in Japanese, I won't comment on the Japanese voice actors; I do not understand the language enough to truly grasp the emotion and meaning set behind actual words, and the only thing I have to go off of is the fansub group's interpretation of what characters were saying.\nNow that that's out of the way, let's talk about Brotherhood. The plot of the show spans so many characters that it's a testament to the ability of the writers that they were able to keep consistency throughout the astounding and wonderful plot.\nThe show takes place in a fictional nation called Amestris, a place fully realized from top to bottom. Every territory's similarities to one another, and their differences, are intricately designed, and conveyed through actions, visuals, and dialogue, without ever being explicitly stated or exposited. But not just Amestris; at least two other nations are given screen time, and even one nation we never actually see, are conveyed as so different from Amestris, and yet it's clear that they're all in the same world.\nSetting is great, but the characters are what make Brotherhood truly shine. I could go on about each of them individually, probably for hours on end. Each and every supporting character has their own story told, without ever dragging or detracting from the main plot of the series. Everything is woven together seamlessly, from beginning to end. The viewer is in the dark for most of the villain's plans and doings for most of the series, but by the end, it all makes perfect sense, and again, this is achieved without ever having the villains simply go on a ten minute monologue explaining everything.\nEvery minute of the series is spent developing characters, advancing the plot, and showing the audience what they should know when they should know it, all at the same time. Even the slowest parts of the series are kept fascinating throughout.\nThe English dub is being produced by FUNimation, with most of the VAs from the original Full Metal Alchemist series reprising their roles. At the time of writing this review, the English dub is not yet complete, and there are still some characters yet to be voiced, but from the first thirty-nine episodes, unless everyone absolutely drops the ball for the latter half of the show, I am confident in saying that the dub is fantastic. Every character is brought to life through a combination of excellent writing and acting, and it's difficult to tell which of the two is doing more to make them believable.\nMood and tone are very important in that as well. From all the praise I've been giving the series so far, it should come as no surprise that the soundtrack is beautifully composed and employed exquisitely.\nEverything I've mentioned so far has been fantastic. So what about the low points of the series? What's done poorly? Nothing at all. Every plot thread culminates into something spectacular, no character is forgotten, and everything else is simply amazing. The only real criticism I could think of for the series is that \"science\" basically means \"magic,\" but even that doesn't detract from the series being astounding.\nWonderfully paced, masterfully told, and expertly written, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood is as close to a perfect anime as any of us will see for a very long time. I five it a five out of five, and a huge recommendation to anyone and everyone.\n        "},

But when it starts it won't stop and every episode is the very definition of f****** epic. \nOne final thing, after watching brotherhood i gave the original an 8 instead of 10. and seeing brotherhood all the way through and comparing it with the original wants me to give the original a 6 or 7. of all the 100+ anime i've seen this takes the crown without breaking a sweat.\n        "},

The story was pretty great, it explained the science of the world very throughly, making it seem very believable. \nIt had its moments of fun, but a lot of it was misplaced, the humor was placed in times that it was not needed. For example, there was Izumi's.... disability, of her constantly spitting up blood after overworking herself. In Brotherhood, they passed that problem to be more comedic,\n          \n        not much of a serious problem, as for depicting it in FMA 2003, it legitimately made me scared, whenever that happened, and I feel as if the original writers showed the pain that came with her sacrifice.\nI feel as if the character development was phenomenal, it made me love the characters more than I did in the original. Especially Scar's transfer from him switching from killing state alchemists to working with them, with inspiration to change the military's view on the Ishvalans.\nThe ending was very... very... I don't know how to describe it, but it made me happy to see how things turned out. But upon seeing the ending, it left me feeling very empty, hoping that something could happen next. If Ms. Arakawa had intended on us feeling this empty after finishing FullMetal, she sure as hell succeeded.Crafting an ending that ends the story entirely, but still leaves you wanting more is not something that many writers can do.

When brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric try to use alchemy to bring back their mother who suddenly passed away, everything goes wrong. Ed loses his right arm and left leg. Al loses his entire body. The story then follows the two on a quest to get their bodies back while also trying to save their nation from turmoil. \nStory: 10/10 The story line for FMAB is phenominal in my opinion. I have never watched the original series but this series closely follows the manga\n          \n        unlike it's predecessor. As a person who often falls asleep when watching TV, even with shows I'm interested in, this one kept me awake and completely enthralled. I never felt bored during an episode. Each one is important for the overall plot. Quite oftten I find beginnings of anime to be hard to get into and they start off slow. FMAB was not like that. I was hooked right away after one episode. The way the story is told makes you want to find out what's going to happen next. It's hard for me to properly say exactly how the story is amazing, it just it. \nArt/Animation: 9/10 Overall the animation is also spot on. It can be simple yet also have major detail where it's needed. The animators didn't cut corners with this show. It was solid job well done.\nSound/Music: 8/10 This is score slightly lower than the rest only because I wasn'y totally crazy with some of the opening themes. But the music in the show was fantastic. It brought emotion to parts that otherwise wouldn't be as exciting. For example, towards the end, someone is slowly walking towards a door and because the viewer knows what's on the other side of the door, the music brings all that much more emotion to the situation.\nCharacters: 10/10 One of the very best parts about FMAB for me was the characters for several reasons. One would be that there was no single character that didn't serve some sort of purpose. Side characters were used brilliantly and conncected the story together in ways that just worked so well. Even people that you thought were a once and done single episode character, would come back later in the series and be super important. The other reason the characters were so brilliant was because they were just well written. There wasn't one character I didn't like. Of course the villians weren't always likeable as people but they were just great villains. For a majority of the story you could easily hate them but somehow get attatched to them And even when SPOILER some of them die I felt myself feeling sorry for them even though they had been bad the entire time. And as for the good characters, there was something I liked about all of them and I just loved how they all worked together even when they sometimes didn't like each other. It was just a wonderful cast of characters.\nOverall enjoyment: 10/10 There really isn't anything else to say other than that I strongly recommend you try this series. If you aren't familiar with the FMA universe this is a good place to start. While I haven't seen the original series, I've heard from various other people that this is much better than the orginal series. If you have seen the original series you'd probably want to try this as well because it can only get better. As far as dub vs sub I watched the dub so I really can't say anything about the subbed version. But I usually am someone who watches subbed and I usually can't stand dubs. But this one was fantastic and Funimation did a great job. So if you feel in the mood for a dub it's worthwhile. And if you like to stick with subs, then I'm sure that's going to be great as well. \n        "},

That being said I feel Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is as close to perfection as a series can get. \nThe cons: There are really only 2 very minor ones\n1. The pacing is initially very fast and it could be tricky to follow. However it does slow down to a much better pace early on and, if you are familiar with the original series, the pacing won't be an issue at all. I actually watched FMA: Brotherhood before the original but I actually\n          \n        didn't have a problem with the pacing.\n2. Some say the tone of FMA: Brotherhood is to lighthearted,  but this show is still very dark and very mature throughout its run. It is more lighthearted than the original, but there are very few anime as dark as the original Fullmetal Alchemist. So if you prefer darker and more depressing series, than you might like the original more than Brotherhood. \nThe pros: Everything else\nThe characters ALL are memorable, well written, developed, and have a role in the story. There is not a single weak link in the entire cast which is almost unheard of in anime with huge casts like this show.\nThe music is fantastic and fits every scene perfectly.\nThe animation by studio BONES (Cowboy Bebop, Space Dandy, Soul Eater, Sword of the Stranger, My Hero Academia, One Punch Man) is gorgeous and the action is well choreographed.\nThe story is engaging, surprising, and filled with twists and turns both big and small.\nThis show can be dark, depressing, funny, action packed, intense as all hell, romantic, epic, emotional, and everything else in between. It is a very ambitious series and it pays of in every sense of the word. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is truly a masterpiece.\nSide note, the Dub is arguably the greatest in all of anime and deserves to be watched.  \n        "},

Then my friend finally convinced me and I saw episode one. And I was hooked. \nThe story is original. Though there are many themes that various anime/manga share in general, this story is absolutely fascinating\n          \n        in its complexity. FMAB is also good because it follows the original manga, as opposed to the 2003 version, so it's slightly more coherent and has a lot more likable and wholesome characters. \nThe music in this show deserves an award, it's so good and so fitting that it's impossible think of anything better. All the OP's and ED's are amazing, but even the OST is absolutely perfect. I have all of them on my computer and I listen to them on repeat from time to time. \nThe characters are very well rounded and complex, most of them have back stories that are engaging and relatable. You will be able to identify with at least one of them, I can guarantee you. \nOverall, this anime is one of the classics, and it is rightfully so. I don't think I would ever enjoy another anime as much as I have enjoyed this one. \n        "},

There is an overabundance of lore and the best part of it is that the rules remain very consistent. Not a lot of ass pulls that are common in other shows. The show tackles themes such as science vs religion, the  nature of blind government obedience, racism, and family values. However, the show is fairly long and does suffer from some minor pacing problems. The animation is very consistent and the production values are apparent. I found myself enjoying the opening and ending themes very much. The only one I didn't love was the first and third ending\n          \n        themes. The characters have great backstory and motivations. Character development is very apparent in many, not just one character. A somewhat thought provoking show with very rich lore and great characters. Easily one of the best \"shounen\" anime ever. Highly recommended!\n        "},

There are a lot of shows that are so legendary, so fantastical, have made such a huge impact on the world that we live in, that it would be considered a crime to not watch it. 2015 was a pretty amazing year for me, in terms of the anime I watched. I knocked out some pretty big titles during that year. One of them being the 2003-2004 adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist. And, to sum up my enjoyment of that show in\n          \n        one sentence, I'll just say this. I WATCHED ALL 51 EPISODES IN JUST 2 DAYS. Ya. \nI cannot believe that it took me that long to watch this show. But despite how ridiculously quick I fell in love with this show, I didn't wanna immediately jump into the 2009 adaptation known as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I wanted to take some time, so that I can watch Brotherhood with a fresh mind and relive the memories of the show I loved so much. Brotherhood is 64 episodes long. And I finished it in 1 week. So if you want my short and sweet opinion on these shows, I'll just say it right here. Fullmetal Alchemist AND Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood are some of the greatest anime, no, some of the greatest worlds, characters, stories and overall greatest experiences I have ever had in my entire life. And yes, I think that for both of them. \nFor the longest time, I was hesitant to start watching Fullmetal Alchemist because I was a bit confused on the whole original VS Brotherhood thing. For those who aren't aware, when the original Fullmetal Alchemist was being created, the anime actually caught up to where the manga was. And instead of waiting for the manga to get finished, the manga creator gave the animation company permission to go on and create their own version of the story, without any source material to go off of. A little after episode 25 in the original Fullmetal Alchemist, the story branches out in a direction created entirely by the production company, Bones. A lot of people weren't too pleased about this, and by popular demand, Fullmetal Alchemist was brought back in 2009 with a new anime called Brotherhood. For the first 13 episodes of Brotherhood, they pretty much recap the first 25 episodes of the original anime in half the time. Episodes 14 and onward, are all new material, completely based on the story of the manga. \nSo when I was trying to get into this franchise, and I asked people which version I should watch, whether it be the original, Brotherhood, or both, I NEVER heard a single person recommend watching both of them. On top of that, I never heard a single person even like both of them. They would always either say that the original is amazing and Brotherhood is awful, or vice versa. Well, I went ahead and watched both of them. I watched them a year apart from one another, to keep a fresh mind and opinion on them both. And you wanna know what I think. I 100% believe that it would be an ABSOLUTE CRIME to only watch one of them! Both Fullmetal Alchemist and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood are absolute masterpieces in their own individual ways. Not only do i recommend this show to everyone, but I cannot in good conscience recommend you only watch one of them, and not the other. So let's go over why that is. Also, for the sake of simplifying things, from here on out, I will refer to the original 2003 anime as FMA, and I will refer to the 2009 anime as Brotherhood.\nSo. Why do I recommend you watch both? The main reason for that is the pacing. As far as I'm aware, FMA was originally intended to follow the manga's story, from beginning to end. The only reason they didn't, was because they caught up to the manga, before it was finished. But because they had planned to follow the manga, those first 25 episodes of FMA are REALLY spot on and well done. The pacing is perfect, going slow enough to fill the world with so many fantastical elements and to enrich the characters and their personalities. But at the same time, this isn't a multi hundred episode anime like One Piece. So stuff actually gets accomplished, each episode. Which is really good. FMA's first half does its job perfectly. It tells the story at a perfect pace, while also adding in some filler episodes to just further develop this already spectacular universe. Brotherhood, on the other hand, doesn't do this as well.\nLike I said, Brotherhood covers the entire first half of FMA in half of the episode amount. So stuff is really rushed and some stuff outright gets taken out. On top of that, the half way point of FMA is where one of the biggest plot twists of the entire series gets revealed. In Brotherhood, this plot twist gets revealed IN EPISODE 1! I am not kidding. I know Brotherhood was made for the people who had already seen FMA, and that's why the first 13 episodes are so rushed in the first place. But if you're watching Brotherhood as your first introduction to anything Fullmetal Alchemist, it makes a lot less of an impact when something that big gets revealed in episode 1, as opposed to halfway through the series. Brotherhood also leaves some questions left unanswered, if it's the only Fullmetal Alchemist thing you decide to watch. Stuff like how certain characters got connected to each other, how certain characters got to certain locations, why certain events are taking place, etc. Keep in mind, this is not problem if you've watched FMA beforehand. But if you're only watching Brotherhood, it can get a little confusing.\nSo I recommend you watch both. And I VERY much recommend you watch FMA before Brotherhood. For two reasons. One, because, like I said, FMA does a MUCH better job at introducing the world and characters and has much better pacing for the first half than Brotherhood. And two, because it's genuinely really interesting to see these two different storylines. The two are VERY different from each other. And I am honestly very glad I wound up watching both. You may feel a bit overwhelmed and confused with all I'm saying, but trust me. I was confused, going into it, as well. I had a very hard time understanding what everyone meant when they said that the two shows have completely different story paths. It became SOOOOO much simpler when I just went and watched it. And in the end, I got one series with two shows that were had completely different outcomes and both were VERY incredible to watch, from beginning to end. If you outright refuse to watch both, if you demand that you only watch the episodes that are based off the manga, then here's what you should do. Watch episodes 1-28 of FMA. And then continue to watch episodes 13-64 of Brotherhood. That will give you the most complete, and enjoyable experience of Fullmetal Alchemist's original story.\nBut like I said, I still 100% recommend you watch both shows, in their entirety. And that's not exactly a difficult or annoying thing to do. First off, both shows are finished now. You don't have to wait for one episode a week, you can watch as much as you want, on your own time. And on top of that, you don't have to watch both shows, back to back. In fact, I encourage you to take a few weeks, months, or even wait a year after watching FMA, before you start Brotherhood. And again, you CAN do that, no problem. Both shows are entirely complete and released. So you can watch them as quickly or as slowly as you want. And besides, if you watch both shows, you just get to watch more Fullmetal Alchemist. And more Fullmetal Alchemist is a GOOD thing. The only other thing I can tell you, before going to watch both of them, is tell you a bit about the movies. Both FMA and Brotherhood have one movie, each. FMA's movie is actually a finale to the entire show and is the closing act on Bones' ending. So that is an outright requirement to watch, immediately after finishing FMA. Brotherhood has a movie which is pretty much a non-canon side story. It's honestly not the greatest thing in the world and you won't miss out on anything by skipping it. But now that I've given my reasons on what I like about both shows and why you should watch both shows, lets get into the nitty-gritty of what makes Fullmetal Alchemist so great.\nSo where do I even begin? Fullmetal Alchemist has one of the most engaging stories that I've experienced in a LONG time. It's really incredible, the things this show was willing to do, and able to pull off so masterfully. It's really something you need to see for yourself to believe. I cannot stress enough how confident I am that you'll love it. Something I'm really happy about is that I wan't spoiled about ANYTHING, regarding these shows. I knew about the split story paths and I may have seen a picture of the show's main protagonist, here and there. But other than that, I knew literally NOTHING, going into it. And I am SOOOO happy about that! That's why I wanted to keep this review as spoiler free as possible, because this show was just so incredibly powerful and surprising, every step of the way. Even in things that you think everyone in the world knows about at this point. I didn't know about it. And I am so glad that I got to experience every bit of it, in the show, and not from just general knowledge you can't avoid, by simply being in the industry.\nThe characters are absolutely perfect. Every single one of them. There's seriously not a single character in either show that I didn't like. Such a diverse cast that you get attached to VERY quickly. You love seeing them be themselves. You cry when one of them is crying or suffering. You feel genuine anger when a villain gets their way. This show does an amazing job at developing its entire cast, and I would honestly rank it up as having just as great and diverse of a cast as the entirety of One Piece. The animation for FMA is pretty much at the top of its class, for the year it was created in. It's certainly not anything mind blowing, nowadays, but it's most definitely nothing I would consider bad. Transitioning over to Brotherhood, you're blown away at just how beautiful the world has been recreated. It's such a great feeling to see a show you love get remastered like this. And so well, on top of it. \nAs for the classic sub vs dub debate, both of them are really spectacular. However, like Cowboy Bebop and Baccano, I believe Fullmetal Alchemist is one of those shows that sorta needs to be watched in English. The characters and world are just much more well suited in the english language, in my opinion. The only thing I'll warn you of, however is that some voice actors get switched between FMA and Brotherhood. The most/least critical one being Alphonse. And I say most/least because you'd think him getting his voice actor switched would be a big deal, but in all honestly, you probably wouldn't of noticed that they were different, if I hadn't just brought it up, right now. In FMA, Alphonse was voiced by a young boy who was roughly the same age as the character. But when Brotherhood came around, five years later, Al's original voice actor kinda went through puberty and wasn't able to voice Alphonse, anymore. So they had to get a new voice actor for him, and I seriously cannot believe how spot on his replacement voice actor was. It's even more impressive when you find out that his replacement voice actor had zero knowledge of anything Fullmetal Alchemist and also had never even seen the original dub, before dubbing Brotherhood. And she still nailed it perfectly. So that one isn't really a problem. There are 1 or 2 other characters who get different voice actors in Brotherhood, and it might be a bit bothersome to you if you watch Brotherhood immediately after FMA. But for me, it was no problem at all, and I actually kinda preferred the new voice actors for all the characters that had them. So ya, if you generally don't watch dubs, I can promise you that this is a show that is pretty much in complete agreement on being one of the best dubs out there. The Japanese is great, too (And no, I'm not just saying that because Alphonse is voiced by Iori from The iDOLM@STER). But like I said, Fullmetal Alchemist is just much more suited to an english speaking cast.\nAnd of course, the music is amazing. So many memorable tracks that stick with you and do a perfect job at adding to the emotion of every scene. The only music I wasn't too crazy about were the show's openings. Like most long anime series, they switch out the opening theme song every 15 or so episodes. FMA has 4 different opening and ending themes, while Brotherhood has 5. And honestly, I only really liked one opening from both of them. For FMA, I really only like the first opening theme song. I always listened to it and enjoyed it, but I only ever watched and listened to the other openings once. As for the endings, I didn't like either of them, and skipped them after the first viewing. For Brotherhood, I at least like the first ending theme. I like it a lot, actually. It's one of the few ending themes that I never skipped. But for the rest of them, I always skipped them. As for openings, while I guess I can say that they were better than FMA's openings, but I still only liked to listen to Brotherhood's first opening. But that one opening! Let me tell you, that was one of the best stinkin openings I have ever heard in any anime I've ever seen! Visually and musically, it was phenomenal! I listened to that song like 100 times before watching Brotherhood. And I'm still listening to it like crazy, right now. In short, both FMA and Brotherhood have fantastic background music, but I feel that only the first opening of each show are deserving of being attached to this legendary show.\nMan... as you can tell, i cannot praise this show enough. I seriously can't comprehend how so many people are completely one sided with which version of Fullmetal Alchemist they like. For me, I like FMA's first half, but prefer Brotherhood's second half. Ya, I like the original manga story more than Bones' story. But I still don't think FMA is bad, in the slightest. For me, it was a really interesting experience, seeing how vastly different the two of them were. And I am so glad I watched them both. If FMA 2003 was the only Fullmetal Alchemist material that existed in the world, I would be completely happy with that. And I feel everyone else would be, too. But when I got to see Brotherhood, it was so exciting getting to see all the characters I loved again, but seeing them on a completely different pathway than I had seen them go, beforehand. The entire story changes. The entire outcome changes. People's goals are different. Different people are good. Different people are bad. Different people live. Different people die. Everything you previously knew about Fullmetal Alchemist gets completely turned around and gives you another exciting show that tops the original one, that was already so stinkin good!\nI absolutely loved them both. They were absolute masterpieces. I can't believe it took me this long to actually see them. As of now, there are 3 anime series that I believe to be a requirement for everyone to watch, at some point in the life. There's The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Cowboy Bebop, and Fullmetal Alchemist. I promise you you'll love it. I'm honestly not sure how much I love it, to be honest. Part of me was seriously tempted to let it dethrone One Piece as my favorite anime of all time. I think One Piece is still number one for me, but MAN Fullmetal Alchemist comes so stinkin close! My top 5 favorite anime series (One Piece, Haruhi, Clannad, AnoHana, and FMA + Brotherhood) are all kinda tied, to be honest. I seriously can't put them in a specific order of which ones I enjoyed the most. Maybe one day. But for now, I'll just leave it at this. Fullmetal Alchemist is an absolute masterpiece from beginning to end. Both versions have their worth, and both should be experienced by everyone. If you still haven't seen these shows yet, then I am VERY excited for you. Go out and experience one of the greatest stories this world has to tell.\nFullmetal Alchemist AND Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood BOTH get a score of 10/10.\n        "},

Before watching I actually thought Brotherhood was a sequel for some reason. Instead it's actually a more faithful adaptation to the manga. Because of this, the first 13-15 episodes had the same events as the 2003 version, but after that it was completely different. I decided to watch this in English because the first version's dub was great. So which version was the superior one? Most importantly was it good in general? Here are my thoughts.***contains MINOR spoilers***\n\nStory:10/10\nIncredibly well written. It follows the same journey as the original but with different plotlines. While still\n          \n        maintaining the same amount of humor and darkness form the original, this version has better action, more nail biting moments, and better backstory. What I really loved about both of the FMA series' is their exploration on serious topics like war, redemption, death, human sacrifice, and humanity. This is what makes this shonen franchise so special becuz it touches important topics that no other shonens would explore as FMA focuses more on being serious. Ed and Winry's relationship is deeper here so it adds a bit of a romance. Brotherhood also had a better atmosphere as it had lots of scenes that would suck you right into the story. As for pacing, it starts off fast due to the first 13-15 episodes but after that the pacing was perfect. Not once did I feel that it started to slow down. Another huge advantage is that the ending here is far superior. It was way more satisfying and it left giving us everything it had to offer. After a long dramatic journey, the Elric brothers did everything they needed to do and all the other characters lived up to their potential. A lot of sacrifice, a lot of emotional scenes, Brotherhood ended the best way it could've.\n\nArt:10/10\nThis is unfair to compare because this version is more recent but in general the animation is gorgeous. It focused more on animating things in the background, making the action sequences flawlessly smooth, with lots of movement. Most of the settings such as Amestris and the civilians look more realistic due to them being nicely detailed and with great amount of fluidity. The visual and special effects were far better making alchemical powers such as fire to look more realistic. And plus every character looks better here with all their features given more depth.\nSound:10/10\nLike the 2003 series, this is an area where Brotherhood truly shines. An awesome soundtrack that I heavily enjoyed. While 2003's OST had more of a sad tone Brotherhood's OST was more epic that helped give the action that extra intensity. The first ending theme, \"Uso\" is one of my favorite themes in all of anime as well as the first opening theme, \"Again.\" The voice acting was once again terrific with majority of the characters given their same VA although this time Al was given a female to do his voice. His VA however, did a great job and sounded a lot like the one from the original.\nCharacter:10/10\nBrotherhood did what was almost impossible; it made the cast BETTER. This version gave us some new characters that played key roles and made the series very enjoyable. The homunculi were also handled better and given different origins from the original that made more sense. They were likeable in the 2003 series due to their origins making them a lil more human, while in Brotherhood they were mainly evil and sadistic and made their deaths more satisfying to watch. What this also did however  was make them more of a villainous threat and added more conflict to the series. Hohenheim was also more relevant and given more of a backstory compared to the 2003 series. The biggest advantage was the main villain, Father. For one he's the most powerful character of the franchise, he has a stronger backstory with Hohenheim, his motives are more clear and understandable, and he had a bigger impact. Not only was he great, but I would put him among anime's best villains.\n\nFinal Verdict\nSimply a masterpiece, Brotherhood imo was hands down the better adaptation. Better villains, better action, and waaaaay better ending, this was everything I wanted the original to be. It's hard to get two adaptions from the same franchise and not compare which is why I made a few comparisons. But in general this series blew me away. FMA: Brotherhood was not only great it's to me the greatest anime OF ALL TIME.  Ever since I got into this legendary franchise Ive become a huge fan of it. I do recommend watching both becuz although the original wasn't as great as Brotherhood, it still had emotional depth and in general it was very good. This is one anime that all fans must see.\n        "},

It revolves around the two brothers, Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric, in their journey to get their bodies back (you'll get what I mean when you watch the anime). They meet crazy, hilarious, and sometimes really fucking INFURIATING characters along the way. We, the viewers, learn more about the flaws of their country's military and government, and how fucked up it is during\n          \n        this journey. The story changes from simply wanting to get their bodies back, to saving their nation, and it's amazing. \nArt & Sound (8-10/10): The animation is very good, but it is not outstanding, which is to be expected, but does not make the anime less enjoyable whatsoever. The sounds are outstanding, and they set the mood and dramaticize the scenes. \nCharacter (10/10): I LOVE THE CHARACTERS. I especially adore both Edward and Alphonse, who both have distinct personalities, but are nonetheless equally lovable. Edward is more outgoing, and is presented to be the more powerful, in terms of alchemy. Alphonse is understanding, forgiving, loving, AND SO FREAKING CUTE. They are both hilarious and you will absolutely grow to love them as much as I do. The supporting characters are outstanding, from the colonels, generals, lieutenants to the civilians, foreigners and homunculi. \nEnjoyment (10/10): You can tell that I love this anime. It made me laugh so hard I nearly peed, and also made me cry so hard that I felt like my heart was about to break and my chest burst. It is an emotional, hilarious, and OUTSTANDING anime that you are sure to love. \nI recommend this anime. Go watch it. Now. \n        "},

This might be the best anime ive ever seen. \nStory 10: The story is memorable, sad and amazing. Its a tale about two boys and their quest to retrieve a body. Doesnt sound like much at first but after you have seen this anime you will have your mind blown. The adventure they go on is long, sad and amazing. And the science behind \"Alchemy\" which is basically the magic in the serie, is beliavable and memorable. Never did i find the story dull or uninteresting, i was always on the edge of my seat.The fight scenes are also very well\n          \n        made and epic. All i can say is that its one of a kind.\nArt 9: The animation is beautifull and flowing.The fight scenes look beautifull and real. Its amazingly well done. And never in the series does the animation lack (As with many other animes) The character designs are also unique and all characters have their own style and look. The reason i did not give it a 9 is beacuse it didnt really have a distinct art style like Death note for example. Maybe its just me but i think that a very different and unique art style is more fun. \nSound 9: The voice acting on the dub is probably the best i have ever seen. It suits the character perfectly and never did i find the voices out of place. (I watched it dubbed cuz the dub was so amazing) And Ed Blaylock does an AMAZING job as King Bradley. I didnt find the music THAT special but its defiently not bad.\nCharacter 10: The characters are fantastic. They always have a REASON to do what they do. They are, as i said, memorable and unique. Every character has an interesting backstory, especially the main characters. Edward Elric (One of the main characters) is funny but at the same time has had a rough past. He is interesting, deep and has many sides too him. Everything a good anime character should have. And the other main character Alfphonse Elric is just as amazing. He is younger than Ed but is maybe more mature xd. The villains are also very very well made. They are menacing, truly evil and their design of them is dreadfull and badass. I cant say much more without spoiling but ALL the characters are fantastic and have depth and are never one sided. \nEnjoyment 10: I very much enjoyed it. It was always fun to watch and never a letdown. Its easy to watch, and never confusing. Its just really enjoyable. And i cant see why anyone would not enjoy it. \nOverall 10: Ultimately, its one of the best animes ever made. The story is gripping, the characters amazing. Its jut everything you would want from a great anime. Its a must watch for anyone who likes anime, doesnt matter if they are young, old or new to anime or maybe a anime veteran. I mean, after all its ranked number one on this site XD\n\n\n"},

But here's where it differs. Edwards source of his power his also his weakness, what made him stronger scared him and his brother physically and mentally, and I don't think they'll ever recover. It was used as character development, something Kirito heavily lacks. Both believe themselves better then others, but we see Edward plead. We see him agonise over what he's done. Not with Kirito. \nAsuna is great, she has a well of potential, but it's never used. Winry helps, she hinders and she grows as a person. Their both tough and confidant, but we see winery's hobbies a lot more and much more of the doubt and uncertainty she suffers. \nSeriously, I could go on about full metal for a while, so I end it with this, what it.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Now this is what I would call an Anime! Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has everything a viewer could ask for; action, adventure, suspense, thrill, humor, character, a splash of romance, and of course, fun. Not only that but this magnificent Anime includes scientific background; chemistry, to be specific. Could anyone actually believe that a Shonen Anime could have such depth? I couldn't, but Brotherhood kicked that belief's ass and put in a whole new genre of \"Shonen Anime\" in replacement.\nThe series is primarily dealing with the two adolescents: Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric. Starting off a bit slow, the series brings to you their past events\n          \n        and also current events that leads to their status' as human beings. To be quite honest they have pretty much hit rock bottom, having committed taboo; loosing parts of their bodies, Alphonse's whole body; no parents...my lord, it's just to much to handle. The series shows these events in a unique, if I may say in a 'Spicy' manner. \nThough having a troublesome life, the Elric Brothers are near supreme in a technique called Alchemy (the reconstructing of chemicals into any specific shape or form). Most alchemists have to use a \"transmutation circle\" to use any form of reconstruction, yet the Edward can use alchemy with out the use of such. This brings him his name \"Fullmetal Alchemist.\" \nAside from the basics the plot is pretty much a rollercoaster, it changes all the time because of events that take place in the series. This is what I thought was so unique to Brotherhood compared to any other series. Interchanging plots are hard to come by, it puts enjoyment to a whole new level.\nReferring to anymore of the story would just spoil what this series becomes. But what I can say is this alternating plot brings in the exquisite fun that the characters get to handle. New characters get brought in, characters change sides, even characters that have no damn idea what they are doing. This has a huge impact on the viewer, you will never know who to like. Honestly, it's a ton of fun.\nNow for the artsy side of the series. The music is definitely well composed, Akira Senju really out did himself this time. Every piece is used as fluently as possible, it'll be something new viewers should look forward too. The animation...okay, well this probably the only downer. Sorry to tell you, but the art just isn't the best. A little goofy looking at time, sometime the hair doesn't fully suit where the place of the head is, just a lot of stuff. But it isn't dreadful! It's honestly good for what it is and it is based on the way Hiromu Arakawa drew the manga. For the initial art not being at its finest, the actions and motions are eloquently done, no doubts there.\nBut as a conclusion this Anime is worth the time, with all it's elements and new frontiers, nothing can go wrong! If you are going to go on and watch the series, you are going to have a blast. And if you're not, that is your own opinion. But anyway, I hope all you viewers take this Anime in consideration, Thank you for reading!\n"},

Everything about this anime worked perfectly for me. I loved the story, which was amazingly original and had a very good moral (which I find important). The Characters are original and have great development. There just wasn't a single character I found truly annoying. Edward has become my favorite anime character. The music is really good, although I did miss Tsuisou (Kyoudai/Bratja) from FMA. I loved FMA too, but thought that the story became a little random towards the end. I never had this feeling with Brotherhood, because everything I didn't\n          \n        get or found confusing, wasn't part of the story or was explained in a way that I did get it.\nFMAB has sad, funny, exciting and even some romantic moments (although not many).

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I have watched many anime, yet Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood will always be my absolute FAVORITE.  The story, art, sound, and character development are all pretty much PERFECT in my opinion.  So, let's get started, shall we?\nThe story sticks to that of the original manga.  The pacing is a little fast, but I was just fine with it.  It just flowed so nicely that I didn't really seem to care.  Actually, I think the fast pacing adds a bit to the suspense of the story.  In any case, the story is fantastic, filled with parts that are almost impossible NOT\n          \n        to cry through.  Good on bones for doing it really well.\nThe art was fantastic.  The animation progressed smoothly from one frame to the next, even for the large elaborate fight/battle scenes.  I can say for sure that a lot of the scenes in this show would not be as awesome if the animation wasn't as smooth.  Also, I love the character design, which can be attributed mainly to Hiromu Arakawa.  It's fantabulous.\nThe sound was absolutely stellar.  The soundtrack, while it may seem a tad repetitive, is great as it compliments the mood of the current happenings on screen.  The OPs (four out of five of which I have on my ipod) and EDs (I've got two of those) are great.  They seem to fit really well with the overall plot and concept of the show.  Anyhoo, now on to the Voice Acting.  Mike McFarland has been the ADR director for some of FUNimation's best dubs.  In my opinion, this was his crowing achievement.  For Brotherhood, FUNi pulled out all of its heavy hitters: Travis Willingham (Roy Mustang), J. Michael Tatum (Scar), Colleen Clinkenbeard (Riza Hawkeye), Maxey Whitehead (Al Elric), Vic Mignogna (Ed Elric), and Todd Haberkorn (Ling Yao), are only a few of them.  The characters were portrayed with such emotion.  Sure, crucify me for watching the dub, but I have no regrets for doing so (partially because it was amazing and partially because I pretty much only watch dubs). \nNext we get to the characters.  All I can say is that the character development is perfect.  There are characters that you love and there are characters that you love to hate.  Neither are in short supply in Brotherhood.  The backstory of each character is explained in great, but not too much, detail.  Good on ya, Bones.\nFinally, as I said before, this is my favorite anime of all time.  I'm saying this even after I have watched shows such as Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion and Puella Magi Madoka Magica.  I gave this show straight tens.  I can tell you, without a doubt, that FMA: B deserves it.\n        "},

I also took some ideas from other analysis of the show so be sure to check them out.\n Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood - 8/10\nIn a nutshell, a very well done shounen, with amazing action scenes, gripping story and rich lore, with the downside being the two-dimensional characters that all behave according to one dominant characteristic, maintain simple morales because of a cliche but detailed backstory and have a simple one-sided relationship with other characters. The soundtrack is also pretty good, the animation quality is superb, nothing too special, but it is still very good\n          \n        and pleasant to watch. The enjoyement rate here is quite high for a shounen. Characters here absolutely suck, just generic plot devices, but at least the story is very smartly written, even though nothing too awesome.\nBut the real highlight of the show is it's themes. I'm going in depth into them here, so somewhat a spoiler alert.\n\"Wraith, Envy, Sloth, Pride, Lust, Gluttony, Greed\" - 7 antagonists of the show. \nAnd that's where this show truly comes into full terms.\nThe obvious symbolism like \"The Fuhrer\" humans' strive for perfection, racism, extermination, fear, revenge and the \"Equal Exchange\" (basically Eye for an Eye and Tooth for a Tooth) and religion and much more, is all good, but there is more beneath it.\nThe theme of \"God is Dead\" is supported by the fact that Edward is an Atheist all while still being moral, it shows how Edward didn't get his beliefs inModern Naturalism, Existentialism and Humanism through a religous text, but rather from experiences and his own view of the world, which is a reference to the theme of rejection of Biblical Absolutism, where the texts of the bible should not be taken seriously, but only as a reference, and this all links in to the ending episode, where the Father fails to become a perfect being, even through sacraficing the equivilant of god and getting rid of the 7 sinful desires, he does not reach the Ubermensch status, whereas Ed does, through his own beliefs which again come from his own Experiences and his own Philosophy, in the end he sacrafices his power and refers to himself as an ordinary human, he gives himself for others, that confirms he accepts humanity, and sacrafices one for the other which shows he, did gain the Ubermensch status through understanding and accepting and believing in Humanity\nIt shows how Father is the nutshell of the \"last men\" whose only desire is for his own comfort, and he does not help other and contribute, which stops him from becoming perfect. It shows how possibly the lack of religion may give birth to Immorality as in lack of morales (Nietzsche) - whereas Ed shows that it can, being perfect and helping others, all while being an atheist and Ubermensch, opposite of Last Men.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    With a highly ambitious plot such as this there is always the risk of it becoming overcomplicated to execute. However FMAB was never in the danger of this. \nIt is an incredibly well-written story anchored with a great array of characters, almost all of whom has steady series development (I will mention here that Ed's physical growth mirrors his ongoing maturity throughout the show). The plot moves at a good pace; in 64 episodes I can only recall one filler episode (Rush Valley). \nI know almost everyone praises this anime so I'll just focus on some of its weaknesses. One thing I noticed is the\n          \n        ill-timed or rather well-timed comedy value in serious situations. It prevents the show from becoming a runaway drama but at the same time I feel like it takes away the gravity of the situation at hand.\nI also feel that with the multitude of characters there is almost always someone who can double up as Deus Ex Machina. There were numerous instances where all hope looks lost to our protaganists if it weren't for the 'very timely' arrival of character A. It just feels like a cop-out whenever that happens.\nWith these in mind, I still watched it with great enjoyment from start to finish. I have to commend Arakawa for creating a wonderful manga (which I shall start soon, I have to get some books out of the way first!) and Bones for creating this adaptation in the first place.\n        "},

The plot is intricate and tight, and the artwork is simple yet elegant. The only think that im not entirely on board for is the soundtrack, which gets kind of repetitive (if you've seen it,\n          \n        you know what i mean), and the (at least to me) outdated ops and eds.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Nearly every other anime fan I've talked to has recommended this to me. I held off on watching it for a long time though because I usually stick to shorter anime, but now I've finally caved.\nI have to admit, it was better than I expected. Not that I expected it to be bad, but well....\nLong anime tend to include lots of unnecessary details. Sometimes entire episodes are completely irrelevant to the overall plot. There's also some episodes that feel like they needed something to fill in the space and decided to hire some second graders to write it for them.\nFMA: Brotherhood, thankfully, had none of\n          \n        those. They kept the story going without any pauses. I was constantly on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. Everything had its place in the story. Not a single episode passed without contributing to the plot. Hallelujah.\nOne problem in both long and short anime alike is often the ending. Since a lot of anime are based on manga or light novels, they are sometimes released before the source material is finished. Therefore, the anime may have that fancy \"Completed\" status, but it's actually just waiting for season 2. Which may never happen anyway, if the initial release isn't popular enough. Of course, there are also endings that are just plain bad, either leaving too much hanging or just not being well-written.\nFMA: Brotherhood, again, did not have this problem in the slightest. The ending it gave was definite, conclusive, fulfilling, and, as if the writers were answering my prayers, happy. I hope that's not too much of a spoiler. I've seen a lot of good anime with endings that literally bring tears to my eyes. That's not a bad thing; on the contrary, that means it was really well-written. But I personally prefer happy endings.\nIn conclusion, if you're like me and are hesitant to watch anime longer than 50 episodes, don't worry. This anime is worth the time. Watch it. You won't regret it.\n        "},

I only really watch anime when its either on Netflix or gets a glowing review from one of my more hardcore anime friends. FMA:B was one of the few anime that I found independent of those two things and I can honestly say that randomly finding it on an anime steaming site was one of the greatest decisions I've ever made in my life. Once again i'm not the most hardcore anime fan and as such I'm not very genre savvy but from what I\n          \n        understand FMA:B fall under the \"Incest\" and \"shotacon\" genres of anime.\n     I didn't know this when I first started watching the show, at the time if I didn't what the term shotacon meant however if I saw the incest tag I would have never given it a fair shot. \n     The first episode is probably the worst but it's understandable as they need to set up all the characters and the rules of the world however by episode three the pace of it picks up drastically and starts becoming infinitely more interesting and it manages to maintains that interesting pace for the rest of the show.\n     A love story that has more that twelve episodes just screams filler to me so seeing that FMA:B is 64 episodes may be turn off but it manages to avoid filler contact with its unique story premise.\n     where most love stories start before the relationship starts and when it does starts the anime is usually in its final act and that is where FMA:B is different. FMA:B starts in medias res where the two brothers are already in a healthy functional relationship and most of the story revolves around the two brothers trying to live and love in a world in a world that rejects them. It's a heartfelt story that will leave your face with a melancholy smile for most of the show. \n     Id say the worst part about the show would have to main antagonist \"Father\". It's more accurate to say that the main villain is society as a whole and Father merely symbolizes society. One of my favorite things about the show is how most of the characters symbolize something with varying levels of obviousness behind what they mean. The thing is all the characters work for both angles. Everyone has great symbolism but they are also great characters on their own, take away all the symbolism and you're still left with a great cast but that's where Father falls short. The symbolism behind Father is fantastic and I could to talk for hours about all the castrations and other Freudian theories however that relate to him however if you take away all that symbolism you're left with a uninteresting villain and no real motivation. \n     Nintendo won over the hearts of Fire Emblem fans all over the world when they released Fire Emblem Awakening however they blew any potential they had by cutting Fire Emblem Fates into three full priced games. Each games feel incomplete and the game as a whole is much easier as a whole than previous entries in the series. It is easy to see why they would make the game easier, Fire Emblem Awakening was a mainstream success so it's understandable why Nintendo would want to the next game to be even more accessible however the game provides very little challenge to veteran players but then they also cut the story into three different games. By making the game so much easier they alienated the hardcore market and by making the price of entry so high by having to pay for three games they alienated most casual player who would want to play the game for the story.  \n     I'd recommend waiting till Nintendo releases the all three games on one card, if they haven't already,if you're looking to buy it. Until then you can keep the dust off your 3DS by picking up Monster Hunter Generations.\n        "},

I like how the world doesn't revolve around the Elric brothers, unlike most shonen. However, some characters established in the beginning are left out for the majority of the story and the way they all conveniently pop back up towards the end feels incredibly forced. Also, some of the villains are generic and aren't nearly as fleshed out. Especially the main antagonist, Father, whose personality feels identical\n          \n        to any other shonen antagonist.

The Homunculi\nOh god, do I love the homunculi. A fantastic collection of evil adversaries; every time they appeared on screen I would simply gush with both angst and excitement, scared by both the often deceiving appearance and sheer evil of these characters. They’re all powerful in their own right, each of them, of course, embodying one of the seven deadly\n          \n        sins. I still think Lust might have been taken out too early, as it is one of the more relevant and interesting sins in my opinion, but sadly she is one of the first to be taken out and does not make a return. The scenes with Gluttony are really harrowing and nasty, I definitely have had a nightmare or two with him chasing me with his slimy tongue out since I began watching. The Homunculi are terrific villains, they easily overpower our heroes, who then have to use a combination of their intellect and abilities to figure out how to survive. This creates a lot of tension, as it is quite difficult to picture how the homunculi could possibly be beaten. This, along with the two brothers quest for their original bodies, is a great locomotive for the overall narrative. A+\n2.  The Fights\nSo many great battles on this show; Ling and Edward fighting Envy after being swallowed by Gluttony (and then teaming up to get out of there), King Bradley’s return to Central (first fighting with Buccaneer, Foo and Greedling, then the amazing final face-off with Scar), the battle in the darkened forest with Pride and Gluttony, Sloth fighting with the Briggs soldiers in the North - later with the Armstrong siblings in Central. I really could keep going for a long time here, I haven’t even mentioned the final battle with Father. This show is stacked with fight scenes that ooze quality; the slick up-tempo animations, the imaginative counter-attacks and the genuinely surprising outcomes of each fight - FMA:B always keeps you guessing, ensuring that the fight sequences rarely gets dull or repetitive. \nA\n\n3. The Humor\nFMA:B deals with a variety of dark subjects throughout the 64 episodes, but there are also moments of wit and humor that often succeed in keeping the mood light and informal. This is often done by using running gags; FullMetals height (and lack thereof), the ‘animal instincts’ of the friendly chimeras, Major Armstrong's surprising sensitivity, Barry the Chopper's insane behavior, Winry’s temper - just to name a few. There was a couple of times where I felt the humor fell a little flat, but for the most part, I found myself laughing. \nA-  \n4. The Flashbacks\nA lot of the character development on FMA:B happens through flashbacks, where we learn about the origins of each important character. These moments are often haunting and vivid, the story of Ishval and it’s alchemic destruction, told through different perspectives, really made an impression on me. This backstory completely shifts the perception of Scar, the villain of the first part of the story. Suddenly you feel deep compassion towards him and his people, and when it is later revealed that the sole purpose of this destruction was to harness the energy of all his fellow citizens of Ishval, it’s hard not to feel the empathy - in spite of Scar’s recklessness in the beginning. The Elric Brothers’ attempt to bring back their late mother using the transmutation circle is equally poignant; the hideous creature that emerges from the other side is so… wrong, it was hard to shake off that experience. You can only imagine what it must have been like for the two boys. The story of King Bradley along with the tellings of the Dwarf in the Flask and Van Hohenheim also works quite well, I actually would have liked some more flashbacks, specifically with Ling Yao and the country of Xing, which never really gets explored in detail. \nA+    \n\n5. The music and sound effects\nI really liked the theme songs of the earlier episodes (“again\" by YUI, \"Uso\" by SID, “Hologram” by NICO Touches the Walls), but as the show progressed I found most of the other themes to be of lesser quality for some reason, I guess they just didn’t appeal to me. The orchestral music used during the episodes is often sentimental and grandiose, which I actually liked, as it fit the over-the-top nature of the narrative pretty well. The audio effects applied to the voices of some the monsters and villains are brilliant and really adds something to the atmosphere and vibe. \nB+  \nThere was one character whose sound annoyed me, which brings me to things I don’t like about the show.       \nDON’T LIKE\n6. The voice of Alphonse Elric\nThe squeaky and high-pitched voice of Alphonse Elric was a continuous source of frustration while watching the show. I should mention that I watched the show with English speaking voice actors, I would have preferred Japanese voices, but the English subtitles was simply not idiomatic, which made the switch necessary. Now, I generally enjoyed the voice acting, but hearing Alphonse scream out ‘BROTHER!’ over and over again was really tough to go through. I don’t know if it’s the high level of resonance applied to give the voice a more metallic feel (he is a walking armour after all), but the sound of his voice ripped through my ears regardless of the intentions. The same was not the case when he got his original body back, then the voice was just ‘regular annoying’ if you will, but this happens so late in the story that it could take away from the experience. \nD-\n7. The under-utilization of alchemy\nWhen we first get introduced to alchemy, we see Scar going after the state alchemists, who defend themselves in creative ways using their alchemy. Very imaginative vistas of elements clashing together, flying around in all sorts of shapes. Alchemy seems very powerful in combat right off the bat, which is why it is so odd to me that it’s not more present in the later fight sequences. There is a lot of old school fighting going on, especially from FullMetal, who seems to be constantly parrying off attacks instead of initiating them himself and using his powers creatively. At first, there seem to be infinite possibilities when using alchemy, these, unfortunately, do not get explored to the fullest. C+ \n8. The over-explanation of plot points\nThis is what happens when you watch a show that originally aired once a week on a binge; plot points you probably would have forgotten about in the span of a week are instead crystal clear in your mind, and the repetitive explanation of the important twists and turns becomes a drag. I can’t really fault the creators for this one, as I can understand the wish to ensure that everyone could follow this sometimes intricate storyline, but nonetheless, it was something that dumbed down the experience for me. \nB-\n9. The demise of the homunculi \nI’ve already expressed my opinion of the homunculi, who seemed so terrifyingly strong, so undeniable in their coldness towards humans, that their downfall just had to be a letdown. They die too easily. If this was a video game, Roy Mustang would be overpowered. He ends up slaying Lust and Envy with such ease, which poses the question “why doesn’t he just do this to all the homunculi and get it over with?”. All he has to do is check the sky for rainy clouds. This would, of course, bypass the whole structure of the story, but it seems outright foolish to me that he spends so much time in Central Command doing nothing but waiting for such a large chunk of the story. \nC     \n10. The army of lesser homunculi\nOkay, I've come to the realization that I have some general problems with the ending of this story, which the army of brainless homunculi exemplifies quite well. The continuous production of philosophers stones seems to have had the purpose of creating this army. They get introduced in the story a fair amount of time before it begins to conclude, and then we forget about them again, only to have them appear as FullMetal and co. are making their way towards the confrontation with Father. They get activated prematurely and immediately proceed to kill their supposed commander. Then they start pouring out of every opening, rising to their feet after being shot and beaten - they are immortal. We never know how many of them there are, or how exactly they are defeated, as we just see our protagonists fight them off - never really destroy them. This zombie-like army only provides another cosmetic obstacle, it never becomes interesting or vital to the plot what happens to them. The reason as to why they have been created also begins to become fuzzy. Father literally swallows God, and if this was his plan all along, why would he need an army? He could extinguish entire countries with a mere thought. It’s only a problem because the show generally attempts to explain a lot about itself, and this simply seems like nothing but a cheap story tool used to make it a little harder for the heroes to come out victorious. \nD\n        "},

Every character of this show has the potential of being the main character of an anime, and it is not just because the characters are outstanding, but the story really brings out their potential. \nThe story is just amazing and I have not found any flaws. I love how each character actually has a role in all this and\n          \n        that there are no fillers. Nope, not a single filler character or irrelevant episode. I personally love how everything in this anime just goes along. The plot does not have any holes, and excitement and adventure lays in every episode. Hell, sometimes there was so much action in one episode that I felt I was going to explode.\nI really love the way that this anime is so funny and yet so serious at the same time. It goes from abstract themes such as  questioning the existence of God, the aftermaths of a great war, the limits of humanity in a fantasy world to more mundane themes, like problems in a family and the strong bond between brothers.\nI really love how we get the chance to witness how the character grow. The best character development of this show is the one of Greed, who is by far my favorite Homunculus and one of my favorite  characters. The whole Homunculus deal fits so well into this story, like everything does.\nThe art, the animation, everything is just so awesome and I really enjoyed this. This anime was the best experience ever and I hope that other people will enjoy it as well."},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    First of all, I have not read the manga but i have seen the first full metal alchemist. I admit FMAB is a lot better than the original FMA in term of everything: the story, art, sound, characters. \nHowever, it is overated for me being the top anime.\nI will go more into details. \nStory: It is about two brothers try to find a way to get back bodies back. They experience many things along the way and learn certain lessons. It builds up very high climax towards the end but it fails to delivery that. *Spoiler* The final villain was very disappointing...\nArt: Good art. Although\n          \n        i watched it in 2015 so there are some which made better but it is still good regardless. \nSound: I dont have particular opinion on it. I really like the first opening song but that's it. The rest is just so so.\nCharacter: I guess this is where most people give FMAB high rating. The development around these two boys are interesting. Wide range of characters.\nEnjoyment: As being a shounen anime, it is expected some cool and epic scenes. There are not much of it. The fightings scene were rather plain and dull in my opinion. There were only 2 or 3 good fighting scenes out of the whole anime. I am also a person who expect good and epic fighting scenes so it is definitely a dissatisfied feeling for me from this.\nOverall: It is definitely not a bad anime but it is not as great as the Hype suppose to be. I had too high expectation when i started it and it only left me hanging there. I do recommend it as an anime to watch if you have time but it is not a must-watch for me...\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    What to say about the number one charted anime on this whole site? Well.\nI came into the anime world thinking I watched this anime, this was the first serious one I ever watched after the regular Pokemon, Digimon, Dragon Ball Z, Bleach, Naruto  - quintet. Only, as it turns out I watched the first edition, not Brotherhood. \nIt took me a good year to realize Brotherhood exists and oh my, was I over joyed to know there was more of the fascinating story about alchemists. \nFirst thing that instantly caught my attention- the opening. The music was so good the entire time it was\n          \n        ridiculous, opening after opening, I kept getting more intrigued. Usually, there's always one song I don't like but not in this case, no, in this case I liked ending too which happens exactly never. Still, I think that one thing the first edition has over Brotherhood is the music. Not in openings but the scene music sang in Russian. Amazing. \nThe other thing I liked was how clean the art looked. There's nothing much I can say here, the style of drawing is specific in a way you can immediately know it's FMAB you're watching. \nNow, onto the characters. \nEdward and Alphonse are our protagonists and while there's the usual trope (genius kids having super-amazing powers that even adults can't handle) it's not exactly true. Oh you think it is until it's very quickly proven that someone /can/ take Edward on, and that Edward /can/ advance on the field of power. But more than that, it's the character development that you like. Just like in real life, Edward and Alphonse have their ups and downs, the downs of course being more prominent,  and they have their hurdles and orders to get over. They also have to deal with their goals and disappointments, and generally dealing with the not-so- ideal world where they get to live until they're ninety and their friends don't die. \nThe alchemy of the world is rather interesting. Actually, the whole storyline that's discovered bits by bits, is more than interesting, exposed from multiple angles. The theories of life, world, everything and nothing, the chase for immorality and knowledge, FMAB deals with every question separately but connected by string until you understand. \nTruly, this anime is one of the best I will ever watch and will ever be made. The care put into connecting this world with ours via perpetual questions and faults of humanity is astounding, as is almost each and every moment of this story. Completely worth watching sixty-four episodes. "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    “Quotes at the beginning of reviews seem really stupid to me.” – Me.\nI have always had a special relationship with the Fullmetal Alchemist series. Roughly 5 years ago, at a ripe teen age, I attempted to watch the original FMA. This was, if you have ever seen my dropped list, a failure of an attempt. I ended up dropping it around the 40 episode mark, basically just before everything really got going for the climax. I hold vague memories today of the old attempt, and recognised a few of the plot-lines that cropped up during FMAB. However, overall, I remember my opinion of this series\n          \n        being rather lacklustre. If this was due to my age at the time, or the overall series, I have not yet found out. \nAs a result, you can probably guess I was always hesitant to attempt a re-watch of the original series, or an attempt at watching Brotherhood. Throughout the next 5 years I would always see it as almost a chip on my shoulder, knowing I haven’t experienced a series so highly acclaimed, not only by this site itself, but the members of the community surrounding it. It gave me the feeling that my MAL list was incomplete, missing a vital entry that so many others had that it seemed commonplace. Today, I finished healing that chip on my shoulder, and finished watching Brotherhood - and not the original series. My main reasoning for this being that regardless of me being young (and honestly, at that age, stupid) some part of the series lead me to dropping it, and picking it up again, even factoring in my terrible memory, would make me re-watch the series, and not watch the fresh experience that Brotherhood could provide.\nSo, 300 words in and I final begin talking about the actual series. So, what did I think? Well, it was… respectable. Yeah, that’s probably the best word I can find to describe it. My first impression after coming back to the series was remembering the art style I had missed. It looks almost generic at first glance, but holds a very clean look to it that you don’t see too terribly often around other series. Its appearance was bright, yet dull. The characters were crisp, get clearly weathered. It gave a good look to the series which fitted with the overall tone the plot presented – on the outside, it appears relatively simple, but at a finer look, there’s more to it – something that some young idiotic teenager might glance over, as I clearly did back when watching the original. \nGetting my complaints of the series out of the way, I only really hold three. \nFirstly, the infamous pacing issue at the beginning of the series that I was warned about time and time again. Honestly, I ignored any complaints I received, but watching it, this is a serious issue for the series. I understand it is trying to present a lot of information at once to the audience, but I found it cluttered in its presentation. The only reason I didn’t fall into a spiral of wondering “what the fuck is going on” is because I had already seen the original series, and had a firm grasp of the main plot-line that it was explaining. Watching it, it’s explanations could have been better and more concise, and overall would lead to an audience that is more confident in the plot-line they are being lead through. \nSecondly, the equally infamous ‘dog + girl = bullshit’ plot-line that I experienced through both brotherhood and the original series. When watching FMA way back when, this had a huge effect on me, and I was left nearly crying after watching and understanding what had happened alongside Ed. In brotherhood, it felt way more rushed. The end of it leading me to wonder if the little effect it had on me was the fault of the series itself, or me now just being an emotionally-hardened bastard.  Either way, it could have been done better, and my masochistic side would have liked to have been left a quivering mess once more.\nThirdly, the final arc. The final arc annoyed me because it came rather suddenly. We’d been following the characters closely almost week-by-week of their lives. The time skip that suddenly jumps us to Spring just annoyed me. I don’t mind if the series was 80+ episodes, I would have liked to experience the build up to the final arc alongside them, instead of just having a time-skip which ultimately pulled me out of the immersion I had for the series up to that point.\nTying in to my second complaint, I will give credit where credit is due. One major factor that I loved about the series was the use of their characters. ‘Girl + dog = bullshit’ stayed with Ed and Al throughout the rest of the series, and they made continuous references to it. I’m not a fan of episodic anime because I feel like by the next episode, everything I’ve shared with the characters is almost forgotten, and it makes me feel like I’m stagnant and stuck at the same position as I was at the start of the series. This was a great fix for it, and it was a relief to know that the characters remembered their own experiences with the audience. It helped boost the level of immersion I felt with the series, as well as boost my connection with the two main characters. \nEvery character within this show matters. The show doesn’t present anyone to you who is useless. It was nice to know that regardless of how useful they are to the cause, or how powerful they are in combat, everyone is playing a part in the plot. It made me feel that, although this is a shounen show, I can trust that all the information they give me is useful to the main plot-line, that none of what they show me is ‘filler’. It made me think that everything I was taking in was important. It allows me to have character’s like Ling Yao as my favourite, and be content with the level of development they got, instead of yearning for more knowing the possibilities the side character has - as I am with most series half the time. I think this is one of the main contributing factors to the show’s success, as it gives the audience a sense of completion about all the side characters, and side plots that they see, while having them remain relevant to the overall plot.\nThis isn’t really something I’ve ever come across before - at least not to this level. It makes Brotherhood unique, and is what makes me see this as a “respectable” show. it’s presenting a level of passionate storytelling that you don’t come across enough now-a-days within anime. For me, it was nice to watch the show knowing all of the stuff taking place will be important one way or another. \nSeparating my analytical view and leaving pure enjoyment, I would say this is a good show, great even. Alchemy is cool and fight scenes are cool. Stories which have a completion are cool, and cool characters doing cool things are cool. However, with the analytical side of me in place, I can’t describe this show as anything but heavily respectable for what it did, because although it had a great presentation of side characters, part of me found something missing. I think in part this was Ed and Al’s development, because really, they don’t have much after the first few arcs. Even Ed says himself near the end of the series, he hasn’t changed much from the kid he always was. If the time skip wasn’t in place, that would have been a perfect time to further the development and connection between our two main characters, and would have been a joy to watch. \nSay it’s Ed and Al’s development. Say it’s the person inside of me conflicting with the genre. Say it’s the past child within me who was confirmed to leave a dropped series dropped. In the end, I found something missing from the ironically complete story. But this doesn’t make it not worth the watch. This was a good show, especially compared to some of the other shit out there, and is definitely worth watching - if not for the enjoyment; but for seeing it’s brilliant presentation of its story. \nYou have my respect Brotherhood. \n- Beaoo"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the best Shonen anime ever. Not just that but, this is also one of the best anime I have ever seen. Though, personally, I haven't seen the previous FMA adaptation so, I won't compare both of these show on this review.\nOn a world where alchemy exists, you will embark on a journey with Edward Elric and his brother, Alphonse Elric. After these two lost their Mom, they tried reviving her by performing human transmutation. However, it did not work and instead, Edward loses Alphonse. Edward then tried to put Alphonse's soul on a large armor and it did work but in\n          \n        exchange, Edward loses his limbs. So, because of this incident, Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric will get their bodies back which is to find the Philosopher's stone. However, as they try to find it, they discover something dark with this stone and within the nation.\nThe story is told straightforward and there are no fillers on this show (Well, there's actually one recap episode). As the story goes on, it gets better and better. More mysteries are discovered, connections, and how these wraps up until the end. Though, a few people complains on how light this series is, well, it's a Shonen anime. What really matters to me on how well-driven the story is. Especially that great ending.\nThe animation is pretty good and simple, but it isn't the best. Some of it's fight scenes can be good (smooth) while some can be pretty mediocre. So, it can be inconsistent (In terms of fight scenes but, the artwork itself is consistent until the end). It's simplicity though does fit the show as it is a Shonen anime. \nSame goes to the soundtrack - good, but not the best. It's soundtrack can be really repetitive at the first part of the show but, they introduced more soundtrack as the show goes on. Also, give props to the Seiyuus. Each of them really fit the characters itself thus, captures it's emotion. I love every OPs and EDs except for Opening 4. \nThe characters on this show are outstanding. What makes them outstanding is how they really react to every situation as the story goes on. This was done very realistic. The villains are great because of what they truly desire. Pretty much every other characters have a purpose on this show and they have a goal. They were not just thrown in randomly.\nOverall, I enjoyed this show to the fullest. This show is indeed a masterpiece. There were just too many moments that were really great on this show. This is a series I'll never forget. I recommend this show to everyone - newcomers, Shonen fans and even fans who doesn't really crave to Shonen. Just watch this show now.\nScore: 9.6/10 (Because of my enjoyment factor, it is rounded up to 10/10)\n        "},

Anyways, this show is guaranteed to give you enjoyment, and you'll definitely rate this show highly compared to others (there's a reason why this show tops many top anime lists). The only thing is that I recommend watching the original fma before or after this mainly because of how\n          \n        the story differs. The original fma is more of a story of character, like hughes who is given much more time in the original, while brotherhood is more of a story of plot. Another great feat of this show is how it cemented my taste in anime. I like more somber anime with more mature themes, and this show is the main reason why. Overall,  this show is a definite recommendation and you will very likely fall in love with this anime.   \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    THE OVERALL SCORE IS ARBITRARY.\nMy rating for Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood: Must watch for everyone.\nThis is a show that masterfully blends elements from a variety of different genres into one masterpiece that is nearly impossible to dislike. FMAB does everything well and excels in it's character development and it's song selection. Most shows are only good for those who like the genre but FMAB does so many things so well that I believe EVERYONE should at the very least try it. Lets break it down\nStory: The story is nothing special but it's also done well and it keeps you captivated. You follow the two Elric brothers\n          \n        as they travel throughout the country trying to find a way to restore their bodies. Its not too complicated and can be thoroughly enjoyed even if you don't care about any of the nuances in the show. The actual progression of said story (the search for the philosophers stone to restore their bodies) is fairly generic and gets carried by the amazing characters in the show.\nCharacters: I can't stress enough how good the character development in this show is. Many shows have a strong main cast of characters and a background cast that's developed just enough for you to remember they exist. FMAB, on the other hand, has a literal army of characters that you not only remember, but actually care about. Both Edward and Alphonse are interesting to follow, Winry is the best supporting character I've ever seen (with a beautifully non forced romance between her and Ed), Mustang is arguably THE main character as a character who gets almost no screen time compared to the Elric brothers... I could keep going. If there is any reason to watch Brotherhood over the original it's the characters.\nSound: Just listen to one of the opening songs. Or endings. This show is easily a contender for the show with the best chosen music. No other shows songs has ever brought me to tears but FMAB's songs do it consistently, while the other songs hype you up for the battle between the protagonists and the Homunculi. \nArt: Look it up and judge for yourself. I think brotherhood is a beautiful show but this category is more subjective than the others.\nThe most important aspect of this show though, is that it isn't basic. It's core principle (Equivalent Exchange) creates a lot of thought. While watching this show you can either: zone out and watch the Elric brothers beat the **** out of everything and everybody OR actually think about the underlying themes in the show and spend some time on the show after watching it. Both ways are exciting and can suit a wide audience. \nClosing thoughts: For those who are brand new to the FMA franchise, I suggest watching Brotherhood first. Brotherhood is the prettier show, with stronger characters and better music. The original excels in it's story and most particularly it's ending. I believe that watching FMA first would spoil the experience that is Brotherhood.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    It's obvious by my ratings I love this anime. But that doesn't mean I will just kiss it's ass. I'll try to keep this review short cause I don't like obnoxiously long reviews which are more like novellas, so Let's go:\nIf you have not seen the original or at least part of it, DO NOT start with Brotherhood. The start of this anime really throws you in without any explanation or reason to care for anyone and the events that take place in the first 12 episodes or so are watered down versions of what took up a large chunk of the 2003 FMA.\nNow that\n          \n        we've got that out of the way, It's time to get on to what makes this anime so good, as in the remaining episodes. After the initial rushed episodes the anime slowly settles into a masterpiece and you can really tell when it starts to get very, very good. You can tell the entire plot is planned out to the very end, unlike a lot of other shounen series such as Fairy Tail for example, which will shit out more and more arcs until it no longer sells or the author dies. \nAlmost every character in this anime is likeable. All the protagonists are worth rooting for. My personal favorites were Colonel Roy Mustang, Ling, and Olivier Armstrong. Even some of the villains such as Wrath and Greed are amazing as well. Our 2 main characters, Ed and AL are some of the best main characters in a shounen. They have more unique goals then the typical knucklehead who wants to be the greatest at whatever he does.\nIn the animation and sound department... what can I say? This is BONES animation. The art-style of the original manga is adapted masterfully, it's very polished and the animation quality is superb for a 64 episode anime which stays fairly consistent. The soundtrack is perfect, each piece highlighted the mood of the scene, but didn't try to take it over. The openings and endings are also very good, I still listen to each and every one all the time.\nOver all, if you haven't seen this yet, what are you doing with your life?\n(Note: I know I ended up kissing it's ass, shut up)\n"},

First things first I really doubted that this show would be as good as the original series even though this was the highest rated show on this website at that time. Now that I've finished watching both I can easily say that I loved Brotherhood more but that's just my opinion.\nWhen it comes to Brotherhood the first thing I noticed was the pacing of the show. Stuff that took a long time to develop in the original just zoomed past and took me no time to get used to because I thoroughly enjoy fast paced anime.\n          \n        Although I must say that Brotherhood had a much lighter tone in comparison to the original and the comic elements were always well timed and never even came close to feeling cringe worthy.\nTo me the main aspect in which Brotherhood trumps the original FMA is the \"emotions\" on show. This show can be serious at a moment and very sad and filled with emotion the next. It can make you laugh, cry, jump in your seat during the action sequences and in short it never fails in mesmerizing you.\nNow for the individual ratings: \nSTORY- 9/10\nNo surprises here, absolutely amazing plot line which I had no complaints with. Enough number of twists and turns to keep you hooked and a whirlwind of emotions awaits you around every corner.\nCHARACTERS- 10/10\nThis for me is the exact area in which Brotherhood trumps the original FMA. There are a lot more characters with excellent character development to support the main protagonists, makes it a helluva lot more fun to watch and gives the series a unique zest.\nSOUND- 9/10\nGotta say that the openings, endings are one of the best if not the best in anime history. Literally every opening is on point in portraying the emotions of the protagonists and the atmosphere of the show is enhanced due to the excellent soundtracks.\nART- 9/10\nAgain no complaints here as such, art could have been much better but again there was nothing too flashy here and it did the job well enough imo. \nOVERALL- 10/10\nFor me personally Brotherhood felt much better in literally all aspects but I do respect the original a lot too, for me the 6 year difference between the 2 seasons really shows here. The fact that Brotherhood was meant to be a complete adaptation of the manga also really reflects here, it has minor flaws but none worth paying heed to. I personally felt that this anime is one of the best anime's I've watched recently and it might just be one of the best anime's I will ever watch. "},

And I'm not exaggerating when i say Hiromu Arakawa is the JK  Rowling of the anime industry. The show isn't just strong in story wise but it is strong in all aspects. It is a full package and deserves all the praise and in this case ratings. Now on to the review:\nStory (10/10):\nThe story of Fullmetal Alchemist is just amazing. It keeps you rooted to your seat till the last second. The first couple of episodes are similar to the original but then it starts to follow the manga.\n          \n        Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood explores the adventures of the Elric Brothers and how they unravel the big secret of Amestris lurking in the darkness. There are many moments that break your heart and many that will make you want to rip your hair out. It has such a good story telling and explains everything that is happening. And the fight scenes are well choreographed. The fight scenes aren't your typical Shounen fight scenes. There isn't any unnecessary talking during the fight and some scenes just stay with you forever! Of course the best part of the show is the ending! The ending is just beautiful and ties everything up nicely. There is no loose ends and leaves you satisfied but you still want more. Honestly I'm still waiting for an OVA. Overall the story of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is excellently written.\nArt (10/10):\nSome people say the art work of the show isn't special or unique. But i disagree only because of the fight scenes i mentioned earlier. When you watch the fight scenes it leaves you in awe. The scenes in Resembool, Ed and Al's hometown are beautiful. The art style is crisp, perfect and has great details. \nSound (9/10):\nBoy does this show has the best opening in any show ever!!! The show has five opening and five endings and out of the five openings I absolutely love four of them. Again by Yui really gets you into the zone and prepares you what to expect from the show itself and Period by Chemistry is a great opening for the climax. The ost's are really good and some are memorable but the only downside is some are repetitive and sometimes you might get bored.\nCharacter (10/10):\n What makes the show amazing is the characters. If the characters aren't amazing then there's no point of a good story and this show has the best ensemble cast yet. The protagonist Ed is an ideal hero. He has some quirks mostly to do with his height but has a big heart. Originally the Elric Brothers, Ed and Al set out to find the philosophers stone but got tangled in a huge plot which can potentially kill everyone. And here our heroes want to do everything they can with help of their friends to save their country. The good part of this show is every character is memorable in their own way. The characters, Roy, Riza, Armstrong, Winry and Izumi from the original are back along with new characters Ling, Mai and Olivier Armstrong who bring originality to the show. The homunculi do an amazing job as villains. And some do surprise you when their identities are revealed. Of course a strong point of the characters is their voice actors. Whether you watch it in Japanese or English the actors do an incredible job and brings justice to their characters.\nOverall watch this show. This is a must watch for all anime fans or people who are trying to get into anime. There is never a dull moment and it is worth your time. I would keep a tissue just in case. A superb masterpiece.\n        "},

Anyways, the story is of two brothers who lose parts of their bodies, and one them loses his whole body and his soul is attached toa suit of armour. They lose their mom and try to bring her back using this stories version of alchemy and it ends badly. Like I said justa second ago they lose their bodies. So they set out on a journey to find a relic called the Philosophers stone which can break alchemys rule of you must lose something in order to\n          \n        obtain something. On the way they join the state alchemists to get more information on the stone. Everything else goes from here. The brothers are also constantly running into bumps in the road and villians. Since they're in the military, they have to fight these creatures, the homunculie. Since they have to fight them it gives them more than just a \"I need to save the world so I will\" motivations. \nThe art of this show isn't really the most unique, but it still looks quite good. It was also animated by bones. Who are pretty good animators and have made other good looking anime\nEach of the characters all seem likable and fun to watch. Since the show is fairly long you get to see each characters comedic side and a dramatic/dark side. although I didn't like how all the characters in this version at the beginning were just kind of thrown in there just so they would already be there.\nThe first about 13 or 14 episodes felt rushed so that the new stuff for brotherhood could shine in soon and just get over with the original 2003 stuff.\nMy enjoyment of the show was amazing. I loved each and every second of it, there was always something happening to keep me engaged.  It has many twist and turn along the way. It's also good it can be good through each episode considering its length.\nOverall I would I would give it an easy 10/10\n        "},

This series, however, is probably nine times better. Even seeing the original this is a completely new experience after about the first six or seven episodes. The artwork is great, not that the original was bad, but it just seems to have a slightly updated, high definition spin on the old. It also seems to add a bit more gore than the original, showing the inner workings of the fights rather than just blood squirts. I love this\n          \n        series, and even if you weren't a fan of the old series this one will likely suck you in with its elaborate plot and the way it propels you straight into it once the ice is broken. \n        "},

You can see very clearly the differnce between Al's and Ed's movements, which is normal since one is an armor and the other a human. They also put a lot of effort in\n          \n        the action sequences where everything destroyes in a natural fashion.\nSound - 8\nReally not so different to FMA, the quality is good, but not the best.\nCharacter - 8\nHere is where most people complain, and here is where you must know that Brotherhood is not FMA. While FMA runs over character development, and you get to know almost every character as good as the main characters, Brotherhood fails in that. And they fail on that because Brotherhood is more story-orientated than FMA. The character development is so deep in FMA, that you feel like if an arc finishes when any secondary character dies, while in Brotherhood the death of a character just seems like an ordinary episode, the best example is Hughes, that while in FMA you get to know, and love him very much, in Brotherhood is just another death. This works just fine with Brotherhood, as you'll see when it develops ever further.\nEnjoyment - 10\nThis is tricky, cause if you've already watched FMA, you'll feel like a simple re-run, but as a matter of fact, I'm enyoing Brotherhood much more than FMA, not just because it is running faster, but because they are only empatising things related to the plot, not to the character development.\nOverall - 9\nWhile Brotherhood deceive FMA anime hardcore fans, it's good in its own way. It uses a different formula than FMA, and I'm sure that it'll work out. So if you already watched FMA, and you aren't sure if  watch this or not, please do, when the time comes you'll be satisfied that you did, just don't get impatient.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    I thought it was terrible! It’s the worst show that I have ever seen… is what I would like to say. To my surprise, FMA:B is the best shounen show that I have seen in my life (not that I have watched many other shounen series, but whatever). If I had seen this as a kid, I may have been reeled to watching anime way earlier than I did. Note that I haven’t watched the first anime adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist and I don’t think I will anytime soon.\nFrankly, I was hesitant to pick up FMA since I tend to avoid shounen like the plague,\n          \n        but since I have dedicated myself to watching the more popular shows recently, I figured that this is the one that I should start with (also with a lot of persuasion power on the part of my friends).\nWhat made me like this show? Well, for starters, It is very, very entertaining. Believe it or not, I finished watching the whole of FMA:B in just four days. I loved it that much. It had very nice fight scenes and overall aesthetic appeal. But FMA:B had something that similar shounen shows didn’t have: direction. Unlike most other shounen anime, FMA:B knows that it has a story to tell. It doesn’t waste time on things that do not contribute something to world building, character building/development or historical background. You will even find yourself amazed that “filler” episodes aren’t exactly filler.\nI guess this is from the fact that the manga has already ended when Brotherhood was made, but it’s still pleasant to find a shounen anime that doesn’t troll you (hello there Bleach, Naruto and One Piece!) or make kids’ games a part of a large scale of glorified nonsense (hello there every single toy advertisement anime!).\nOther than these things, FMA:B still keeps the spirit of shounen, an anime that appeals to young children, while being entertaining enough to be appreciated by the veteran anime watcher. I guess the only thing that I would nitpick about is its virtually zero rewatch value. I wouldn’t really want to watch this all over again, but hey, that’s a prime characteristic of a shounen show and I’m completely fine with that.\nI’d love to tell you more about this anime, but I wouldn’t want to spoil all of the juicy parts. I say, just watch it and see for yourselves – a shounen with direction, protagonists with personality and hard-earned real power, and a very nice show to look at. I couldn’t ask any more from an anime from a genre that I don’t usually watch.\nAs of this writing, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of my all-time favorite shows at number 5 with my personal MAL rating of 8.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    I was a huge fan of the first FMA series.  the drama was exciting, I liked the intensity of emotion for Ed and Al and their storyline, I liked the sympathetic portrayal of the homunculi, and so on.  I couldn't get enough of it.  \nThen I started watching Brotherhood and reading the manga, and both of them just blew the doors off of the first series.  In fact, I have since readjusted my score of the first series because of this.  \nStory - the story is absolutely humongous, spanning not just throughout Amestris but around the world.  The motive\n          \n        behind the homunculi and their controlling presence, Father, is quite mysterious and complex, and I like the fact that the reasoning is not so laid out.  I'm writing this as of episode 29, and you can already start to see the scope of their scheme and the ends to which they will go to fulfill it.  And it does this without taking away the very essence of what drives Ed and Al- the desire to get their own bodies back.  10 out of 10.\nArt- Outstanding.  I really don't like the new character designs quite as much as the first series, but they more than suffice.  What really makes the art for this series stand out is the animation for the fight sequences, which look fast, fluid, intense, and extraordinarily exciting.  Also, big plus for the animation behind Envy's true form- looks like something out of a Lovecraftian nightmare. 9 out of 10\nSound- Very strong.  I find it hard to imagine another Japanese voice actor taking the place of Romy Park as Edward Elric, and she's as good as ever here, and the others are highly admirable as well.  The music is not terribly special- I'd say it's good, and serves its function well, but is not great.  8 out of 10.\nCharacter- this is where the series really soars.  While in the first series we primarily got character development for only a handful of characters, here we're getting character development from every direction- not only from the core group, but also Hawkeye, Havoc, King Bradley, Armstrong, Winry, and others, many of whom were not given their due attention in the first series.  But here we really get the depth of the connection between Hawkeye and Mustang, more of a background on Bradley, even Havoc is more than just comic relief.  Because of the breadth  of the characters they take their time to develop, 10 out of 10.  \nEnjoyment- simply put, every episode from about 19 onward had me just about jump out of my seat with emotion, whether it be shock, or glee, or whatever.  It thrills you, moves you, makes you laugh, basically it pulls out all the stops in order to keep you engaged and entertained.  There are moments that were removed from the manga that I wish they had preserved (especially from episode 30 the Ishbal flashback), so that's definitely a knock on the anime, but for the most part I'm getting a kick out of this series.\nOverall- Like I said earlier, I loved the first series, it was one of my favorite anime.  I also was in the middle of rewatching the first series until about the point where the manga and Brotherhood started to pave its own way apart from the first series.  That was three months ago and I have not watched the first series since.  \nThis was headed for a 10 out of 10, but their rendition of the Ishbal flashback in episode 30 left me wanting.  Still, a very, very good 9 out of 10.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    For a while I was very hesitant to watch FMA:Brotherhood. From what I had seen it seemed like a show that was based around humor and seemed like it wouldn't really go anywhere. Don't me get wrong, I love comedy, I just hate it when that's all the anime is about.That being said, brotherhood is hilarious at times, I often found myself laughing while watching it. I eventually decided to watch brotherhood, because I figured I should give it a shot. It has made it's way into my top 5 list and is one of the best animes out there.\nStory- The story is explained fairly\n          \n        well in the synopsis so there isn't much I can really say, but here is a small explanation of it from my point of view. So you have these two brothers who got into alchemy at a young age. They end up losing their mother and they try to bring back her back through alchemy (which is a taboo) but to no avail. In the process Edward Elric loses his leg and his brother Alphonse his entire body, in a worried attempt Edward sacrifices his right arm in order to bind his brothers soul into a suit of armor. The whole story is about their adventures to find a philosophers stone so they can use it's power and get their bodies back. With it being a long anime and having a fairly straight-forward goal in mind you would figure it would have some filler right? Absolutely wrong, there is not one episode of filler in brotherhood, that is what I like most about it. It's a long anime that has no filler! It has done what seems to be impossible to me. On-top of it having no filler, and having non-stop action every single episode, it actually isn't all comedy based like I had previously thought. It actually has a very dark side to it and it caught me off-guard within the first few episodes. A few scenes in particular have stuck with me and still make me depressed or have given me angst when I think about it. Not to sat that it doesn't have comedy in it, it's actually one of the funniest animes I have watched, but the comedy feels good in it and doesn't feel out of place like some anime I have watched.  It has a ton of plot twists that you don't actually see coming and gives you a ton of back-story so you actually feel like you know these characters, not  just the main characters either, you really get to know some of the side characters. They don't feel like they where just there, they all have depth and feel important to the story, and if something happens to them you actually get worried about them and care what happens. It had an extremely good ending and I had only 1 complaint about the whole story. I don't want to spoil anything, but lets just say the ending was \"missing something\". It was nothing critical to the main story, but if they had added a little more at the ending and emphasized on a few things it would have made it that much better.\nArt- The animation and art are really well done. It had some rather creepy and eerie feeling artwork in it, which really set the mood. Nothing much to really say, it was top notch animation and artwork.\nSound-It has a various number of openings and endings, all of which I really liked and enjoyed. Brotherhood has one of the best English dubs in existence, they voice acting is extremely well done and I couldn't imagine watching it any other way.\nCharacter- Brotherhood has a really amazing cast of characters, a rather huge cast of characters that actually have a ton of depth to them and feel important. The two main characters Edward and Alphonse are just awesome people. Edward has a height complex, which he gets made fun of alot and I find it just hilarious. Then you have Alphonse who is just a badass and wants to just get back to his original body. Some of the side characters I really like are Winry, who is a child hood friend of Edward and Alphonse, Louis Armstrong, who is just a monster of a man who flaunts his muscles every chance he gets and gets beat up on by his sister(which is hilarious), ling, who is a foreigner who is actually quite badass, and last but not least is colonel mustang, who is arguably the strongest alchemist with his fire alchemy. My point being is that the entire cast is just awesome and very well made.\nEnjoyment- There was never a dull moment with this anime, whether it was one of the amazing fight scenes going on, something tragic happening, a crazy plot-twist, or just something hilarious, there was always something entertaining happening. You would have to be a really boring person not be able to get some sort of entertainment from this.\nOverall- Overall this is really a masterpiece of an anime. I judge anime very harshly and it made it's way to my top 5 list, so if that doesn't something I don't know what does. It is a very enjoyable anime that ANY otaku should watch. I really can't properly explain how awesome this is, just go and watch it and you will understand, just make sure you watch the dub, because it is a really well done dub.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n         Having watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist series at a young age (the series itself came out in 2004, I believe), my twelve-year-old self was stoked when I found out that there was a reboot whilst screwing around on some anime chat room. The year was 2010. Needless to say, I ended up loving the show, even more than the original. All of my favorite characters had returned, and were just as badass as ever. But this anime needs more than a paragraph. It deserves more than that. There's a reason that people still discuss it, and the fanbase is just\n          \n        as fervent as when the show was airing all the way across the Pacific in good old Nihon. Or the Atlantic and all of Asia... Whatever. Same thing.\nStory:  Without getting too deep into the FMA:B storyline, the basic premise of the show involves two brothers who, accidentally (duh), forfeit their limbs and bodies in an attempt to bring their mother back to life using alchemy, which also happens to be a moral taboo. They then seek to find some way of restoring their lost humanity (and pride) by setting out on a journey in search of the fabled Philosopher's Stone. The story, of course, does not end there. But what fun would it be if I spoiled anything else? Alchemist's story manages to be engaging with, quite amazingly, zero baggage, even while clocking in at beefy 64 episodes. There is a clear purpose constant throughout each episode that never gets muddled or buried by another storyline. Everyone has their motives, and these motives propel the story forward. Some people might find the first few episodes somewhat rushed, as they cover a lot of material in a short amount of time. I assume that this is because much of said material was covered in the first series, which most viewers have typically seen. The pacing eventually evens out, however, when new material is introduced. The anime's story follows the original storyline of the manga, which the original veered away from about halfway through its runtime. And, in my opinion, the manga storyline is much better. There are too many differences to cover, and doing so would mean spoilers, but I will say that the ending in Brotherhood is perfect, much better than the original's mediocre one.\nArt and Animation:  The show is animated by Studio BONES (Soul Eater, Space Dandy, Eureka Seven, Wolf's Rain, Darker than Black, Gosick, Ouran). Those familiar with BONES know that it, when given a good budget, can rival any other studio in production quality. As with Brotherhood, the animation is wonderful. The art is very colorful, and the characters' features stand out amongst the backdrops. The show's visual quality is superior to the original, which is expected with a higher budget. As great as the art is, it isn't jaw-dropping.                                  \nSound: There's not much to talk about here. The soundtrack is perhaps a bit above average, and while it fits and benefits the show, it isn't something I would rush to purchase. The sound design (sound effects, etc.) is worth mentioning, as it brings the fast-paced alchemy battles and gunfire-laden battlefronts to life. Vic Mignogna's performance as Edward Elric in the English dub is also noteworthy.                                \nCharacters:  This is the beef of the show (as with almost all good animes, imo). Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric reprise their roles as the main protagonists in Brotherhood, as well as all supporting protagonists. The villain cast, mainly comprised of mysterious apparitions named after the 7 Deadly Sins (if that doesn't make you want to watch the show, I don't know what will) returns for a second round at our heroes as well. As simple as it sounds, it's not quite so. For starters, there is a substantial amount of characters. It's not the most I've ever seen, and not all that tricky to keep track of (animes like Baccano!, for example), but viewers familiar with harem shows or other tightly-knit casts might be uncomfortable at first with the scale of Alchemist's world. But it's this scale and complexity that moves the show's pistons, all while elevating it above its competition. Not a single character is unnecessary, each one playing some form of role that completes the show. The chemistry between Ed and Al is vital not only for the show's plot, but for the emotional links necessary to keep a viewer interested in a 64 episode show. On the antagonist side, our villains possess just as much chemistry. Er, well, at least some of them... There are some characters whose presence also defies the typical good-vs-bad, and are not necessarily anti-heroes either. Their existence alone provides plenty of material, which, of course, relates back to the main plotline. None of the characters are annoying, which is perhaps the most amazing feat (most shows have at least one character that is obnoxious). Kudos to the writers on these characters. They could be the best I've ever seen.\nThe Final Verdict:  Fullmetal Alchemist has been a huge staple in the anime world since 2004. After Brotherhood, it has become a legend. I always find it easier in hindsight to criticize shows and nitpick their flaws. As I grow older, I'm able to look back at shows that I loved as a kid and accept that they were not the pinnacle of entertainment (Dragonball series, Pokemon, etc.). Looking back at Brotherhood, however, only affirms what I thought of it as a preteen: one of the greatest series of any form of entertainment that I have ever viewed. The world of anime, as well as films, music, video games, and even politics is full of fads, things the “come and go”, as we commonly put it. Five years from now , Sword Art Online will be an obscure title that very few will remember or know about. It's been a decade since the original FMA aired in Japan, and many still discuss it. I anticipate that in the years to come, many will discuss Brotherhood, whether it's children mesmerized by the animation and color, teenagers in awe of the epic actions scenes, young adults enamored in the subtle romantic subplots, or adults impressed and intrigued with the complex chemistry between the characters.\n                                                                                    -Benjamin Escobar\n                                                                                                     GMMPA \n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Where to even begin with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (FMAB)? This anime is truly spectacular, in a league entirely on its own. My absolute favorite, it's changed my life in more ways than one. There isn't a single person who shouldn't watch it; it's a masterpiece. \nThis anime was produced in 2009-2010. I will probably also make references to the first anime, produced in 2003-2004, which had a different plot. So I'll abbreviate the 2009 anime as 'FMAB' or 'Brotherhood' and the 2003 anime as 'FMA'. \nStory: 10 \nFMAB is about Edward Elric and his younger brother, Alphonse Elric. They live in a country called Amestris,\n          \n        in a world where the primary form of warfare is through alchemy, the science of deconstructing and reconstructing matter. The presiding law of alchemy, known as the 'Law of Equivalent Exchange', states that humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. \nI won't provide a summary of the anime, as that's already provided. So let me instead say that the storyline of FMAB is--in a word--genius. There's no other way to describe it. There are so many intricate plot twists that just cannot be predicted. This anime starts as simply the Elric brothers' quest to restore their bodies. But it turns into SO much more. As the Elric brothers meet new people--and lose many of them--they realize there is a large underground conspiracy at work in Amestris. Suddenly they are pulled into something much greater than their mission, and they find themselves working to save not only their loved ones, but their country and the entire world. \n*KEEP IN MIND* This series is different from the 2003 anime known as \"Fullmetal Alchemist\". The first 10 or so episodes of FMA adhered to the original plot of the manga, and then the anime series diverged because the manga had not been completed. Personally, I hated the diverged plot. It simply did not seem logical. The ending of the series was terrible, and the follow-up movie, \"The Conqueror of Shamballa\", was also awful. I felt the 2003 anime and movie did not do full justice to the original Fullmetal Alchemist story. \nArt: 10 \nNeedless to say, the art of this anime is a 10. Arakawa-san (the mangaka of this series) puts great detail into the city of Amestris, the military uniforms of Central Command and Briggs, and every other tiny detail all the way to the last screw in Edward's automail arm and leg. And then there are the transmutation circles!! These were constructed so intricately, I have such unfathomable respect for Arakawa-san for all the work she put into designing these. The art is genius. It enhances the plot and characters even more--if that's even possible--and couldn't better suit the feel of this series. \nSound: 10 \nI love the OST of this anime. It's in my sleeping playlist, my studying playlist, my jump-around-like-an-idiot playlist--you name it, it's there. Tunes like \"Far East Suite\" depict relaxation; \"Overture ~Brotherhood~\" is beautifully reminiscent; \"Xing Symphony (Overture)\" is the perfect music for any battle scene; and don't even get me started on the intensity and tragedy of \"Lapis Philosophorum.\" I don't think even Beethoven could have done it better. I have the highest respect for Akira Senju, the FMAB OST composer. The music doesn't distract, but it certainly intensifies every single scene, forcing the viewers to make the characters' emotions their own.\nCharacter: 10 \nI've already described Edward and Alphonse Elric for you. Edward is your typical strong-willed pig-headed protagonist with an unbelievably tragic past and an ironically huge complex about his height. Alphonse is the more mild-mannered brother, the voice of reason in the relationship between the two of them. Together, they are unstoppable. Their closeness is admirable. \nBut there are other characters besides the beloved Elric brothers. There's Winry, Pinako, Scar, Ling, Lan Fan, and Fu. There are the heroes of Central Command, Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Maes Hughes, Major Alex Louis Armstrong, Heymans Breda, Maria Ross, Kain Fuery, and Black Hayate. And then there are more heroes from North Command at Briggs: General Olivier Mira Armstrong, Major Miles, Captain Buccaneer, and Vato Falman. Every single character in this anime with a name has a huge purpose. Not a single person is underrepresented.\nAnd oh, the villains of this anime! I hated them, of course, but at the same time I respected them so much. The homunculi--nearly invincible and humanlike--are named after the Seven Deadly Sins and emulate their respective sins. But the viewers always catch a glimpse of their humanity--the sadness behind the atrocities they commit, the longing behind their overconfident facades. Sometimes it's difficult to even call them villains, because Arakawa-san shows us that they're not much different from us. Can we really hate them? I have yet to figure that out myself. \nEnjoyment: 10 \nThere's no emotion that FMAB hasn't evoked. I've shed laughing tears, crying tears, angry tears, frustrated tears. I've gone \"awww\" at cute moments and at death scenes. You never know what's going to happen--you can always expect the unexpected. And you can always count on Edward to diffuse a tense battle moment by tripping and falling or getting angry at someone for calling him short. I enjoyed every single moment of Brotherhood, and I would gladly do it again and again. \nOverall: 10\nI would give this series an 11--no, a 20--out of 10 if I could. I have heard nothing but glowing reviews from the people I have recommended FMAB to. Every single genre you can think of is in this series--romance, comedy, military, action, drama, tragedy, psychological--you name it, FMAB's got it! This series has made me cry and laugh and shout at my computer and ultimately smile contentedly at its ending. (While crying, of course, because I didn't want it to end!) I can't even explain how much I love this series. I guarantee it will change your life in some way. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has surely changed my life. I will never forget its impact. I don't think I could even if I wanted to.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is about two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who lose possession of their bodies as a result of breaking the most important rule in alchemy, attempting to resurrect the dead, and they journey across the country of Amestria as they attempt to reclaim their former selves. Edward Elric is this anime's protagonist, the famed \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" whose legendary reputation is rivaled by his alchemical skills, the wise cracking prodigy with an unpredictable personality and a strong distaste for milk, and the height-conscious adolescent with a constant inner conflict about morality, a massive amount of confidence, and an unwavering dedication to his loved\n          \n        ones. If I were to make a list of the greatest anime characters, Edward Elric would be in at least the top ten. Alphonse Elric is the younger of the two brothers, a gentle and likable young boy trapped in a suit of armor that serves as Edward's mediator during Ed's explosive episodes (Al is often assumed to be the older of the two due to his height). Brotherhood ventures into a variety of places throughout Amestria, from the bustling business environment in Central City to the fear-inducing tunnels underneath the city, from the wind-driven snowflakes covering the Drachma region to the primal adobes in dust-consumed Ishval, and, in all of them, this anime crafts the setting with a razor-sharp eye for detail and an amazingly artistic flair.\nThe majority of FMA Brotherhood doesn't focus on the Elric brothers but instead on the people surrounding them. Colonel Roy Mustang is my favorite character, an easygoing alchemist with the coolest power ever (He can unleash fire by – get this! – snapping his fingers!), and an ambitious leader that alternates between cracking jokes and being dangerously serious. There's Winry Rockbell, a childhood friend of the Elric brothers and a gifted mechanic. There's Scar, a sunglasses-wearing Ishvalan with a reputation as a malicious murderer and a mission to destroy alchemists of the military via alchemy. Brotherhood also contains a great group of villains in the Homunculi, the seven nearly-unstoppable immortal-like beings each with their own unique personality, and their Father. The two Homunculi that stood out to me were Greed (The Homunculi are named after the seven deadly sins), a rebellious man with steel-like skin, and Pride. Born from Nightmare Fuel, Pride is this anime's most important villain excluding the main antagonist Father who I will remember most for that frightening scene with Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye. Excluding the emotionless Father, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has characters with great acting, emotion, complexity, and (above all) likability (Is this even a word?)\nThere are five main themes in Brotherhood; the final opening is by far the most emotional, but my favorite is the first, a fast-paced theme song that slowly intensifies at a pace with the opening's singer. Plotwise, there isn't a big difference in Brotherhood from the Fullmetal manga (although Isaac the Freezer never graced the FMA pages nor did Father Cornello evolve into a hulking beast), but the anime is still just as good, with more twists than a Twizzler stick and more energy than a kid on a sugar rush.\nPerhaps the greatest thing about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is its appeal to all genres. If you want tons of action, if you want a show with martial arts, if you want a military-themed anime, if you want some mystery to your show, if you want some sci-fi in your show, if you want a huge focus on adventure in your show, if you want some slice-of-life aspects to your anime, if you want to see buckets of blood, if you want to watch a show with fantasy elements in it, if you want to watch a dystopia-themed show, if you want to check out an anime with depth, then Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the series for you.\noverall ratings:\nstory-10\nart-8\nsound-9\ncharacters-9\nenjoyment-10\noverall-9.6\nrecommendation-extremely high\ncategory-masterpiece\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    FMA: Brotherhood was an anime I was on and off with for years. My friend recommended it to me as an introduction to anime as it seemed to him, right up my street. I could have taken that any other way on retrospect.\nI was given the first 2 volumes on DVD by him to watch. At first, I thought nothing of it cos at the time, I had this stigma against western anime fans that they were all, basically, weaboos and being associated with them, to me, felt like being associated with that one ugly kid in school who smells like beef.\nHowever, once I got\n          \n        into it, I found Brotherhood to be very good. I found the worldbuilding truelly detailed and absorbing while the characters were all believable and fun to watch in their own way. Even the homunculi villains were entertaining in some form or another, my particular favourite being Greed. His arc is incredibly predictable but his character makes it more poignant at times during the story.\nI found the philosophy of FMA Brotherhood quite intriguing as it can be interpreted in many different ways though I'll probably save that discussion for a blog post later down the line.\nI even found the ending pretty satisfying if slightly jarring in contrast to the end of the world plot that occurs just before hand (and more so now that I have also watched the original FMA anime as of typing). Which brings me to the action. The one thing that stood out to me in this anime was how quickfire the fight scenes were. The only anime I had been exposed to beforehand (not counting the Pokemon and Digimon cartoons) were Dragonball Z and Attack on titan, both I thought had incredibly drawn out fight scenes which became more tedious to watch as I got older.\nThe fights in Brotherhood normally last upwards of 10 minutes not counting the 23 minute final fight episode, which is really all it needs to get its point across. The fight scene is something used in action media to keep the story from becoming bogged down in exposition and drama. Its something that is supposed to pump you up and get you really excited. That effect is lost when its drawn out to more than 2 episodes and it just slows down the story. FMA Brotherhood laughs in the face of that trope and instead has fight scenes that are fast-paced and over before you know they're occuring. The Alchemy concept makes for varied fight scenes in characters and abilities from shapeshifting, shadow powers, fire bending, weapon materialisation and golem-style suits of armour clattering together like monkeys fighting in a saucepan cupboard.\nSpeaking of Alchemy, its a very unique ability for both an aesthetic standpoint and a narrative plot device. Its used in tonnes of interesting and comedic ways while its also the crux of the mythos of the show, as well as the driving force for the main characters, the Elric brothers, to achieve their overall goal they set themselves at the start.\nMy only real complaint comes from the portrayal of Father, the almighty big bad of the conflict at hand. His origins are never truly explained and his motivation seems to just stem from some dumb xenophobia towards none-artificial life that is never really characterised. Plus after all the hype he gets about how powerful he is, his final fight scene with Ed Elric is completely...well, without wishing to drop any spoilers, its like a boss fight in a video game that ends up being won in under 3 minutes cos you spent all your time putting points into that one move you purchased yonks ago that has rapid attacks and makes you invulnerable while you're using it. It just took the conflict right out of the story for me.\nBut this is a nitpick on my end and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was the anime that got me into watching other anime shows, and so I think my score may come from some form of personal bias for being my first true anime.\nBut even without that, I still think everything in this show works to make it worthy of an acclaimed reputation.\nNo doubt once I completed watching Brotherhood, I made it my duty to try the original FMA series which I heard takes a different route to Brotherhood and is apparently commonly considered the better interpretation. So that'll be my next review...\n        "},

The action in this anime is cool, and there's a lot of blood, but sometimes the story isn't explained very well. There was one character, Ed and Al's dad (Van something) whose personality kept switching throughout the show, and it wasn't explained why. Also, he seemed to keep moving around very quickly, and sometimes they showed him at two different locations at once. But I'm pretty sure there is no alchemy for teleportation, or I would have understood.\nAlso, I didn't like how Scar suddenly turned good at the end. His character changed too suddenly and it wasn't very natural.\nOverall\n          \n        this is still a fun anime to watch, the fight scenes are very nice.

It has a little bit of every, from a good plot, great characters, exciting AND humorous moments, which is why I think it is beloved so much.  Do I agree with the praise it gets?  Absolutely.\nSTORY:  10\nThe plot in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood kind of seems like it isn't going anywhere for the first few episodes, except for episode 2, which gives us the backstory of the two main characters, but after\n          \n        a little while it starts picking up... and it DOESN'T STOP.  I'm serious.  This show keeps getting better and better and better as it progresses.  The pacing is stellar throughout, and some of the plot-twists are REALLY well placed.  Serious and humorous moments are placed carefully, so as not to interfere with each other.  There will still be the occasional joke in the middle of a battle, but they still work well, particularly the running gag of the main character being so short.  I don't want to spoil too much, but just know that no matter how much you like this show at any point during it, it will still manage to get better from there.\nART:  9\nThe animation during battles is excellent.  It's fluid and easy to understand what's happening.  The alchemy looks cool, especially for people who like flashy battle scenes, but it still manages to not get too overwhelming.  The art is great for the most part as well, but I feel like there were some scenes where there was too much contrast between colorful characters and dull backdrops.  Generally, I think a dull scene should represent a serious or sad moment, while colorful usually indicates upbeat and happy.  Both of these types of scenes are present in FMA:B, but there are a few cases where the art doesn't completely adjust to compensate for the mood of the scene.\nSOUND:  8\nI liked all of the opening theme songs in this anime.  Personally, from best to  worst (although not bad), my order would be 1,4,5,2,3.  This show is known for its openings (among many other things) and for good reason.\nThe ending theme songs were mostly forgettable to me.  I really liked the first one, and I thought the fourth one was decent, but the rest of them didn't really stand out.\nThe OST is very fitting, but there were not very many tracks that I would actually listen to on my own.  The main theme and \"Crime and Punishment\" are my personal favorites.\nAnd what about voice acting?  As to be expected, the Japanese version is not bad, BUT... the English dub is PHENOMENAL.  It's the best I've ever scene.  Every single actor fit their role and was enthusiastic about it, and they definitely knew what they were doing.  I don't hate English dubs.  In fact, I usually prefer watching them unless they are absolutely unbearable, but FMA:B is the ONLY show where a majority of the fanbase will agree that the dub is good, even some of the people who refuse to think so about any other dub at all.  In fact, a considerable number of people agree that the dub is better than the original, me included!\nCHARACTER:  10\nThis may be Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood's strongest suit.  EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER plays a MAJOR role in the story.  They are all developed and all get their own time in the spotlight at different times.  There are a LOT of characters but they are all memorable.  Anything from the main characters, to the soldiers, or the random side characters, to the freaking characters who show up in only a SINGLE episode.  They are all extremely well written, unique, and elaborated on and it is going to be REALLY hard for any anime to top FMA:B in the characters department.\nENJOYMENT:  10\nI really loved this show.  It was exciting, emotional, and funny, all at different times.  It seriously had something to satisfy just about every anime fan (except people who only watch hentai).  I can recommend it to you wholeheartedly based on your interests... and I don't even know you!  That is pretty incredible.\nOVERALL:  10\nThis show is going to be remembered as a true classic for years to come, and it very well should be. Although it is not my number one favorite, I can say that it is definitely one of the few anime that I can honestly say deserves the number one spot and MAL's list of Top TV Series.\n        "},

It's a masterpiece. \n{Intro}\nI watched the original anime as a kid, the first episode I've ever seen was the one when there mom came back to life, scared the absolute hell out of me. I was like 10 Lmao. Finally watched the entire show when I was like 12-13, like 7th grade to be more accurate And It was great, the ending left me kinda unfulfilled but the movies made up for it and were great. But even with the originals darker gritty story, and greed making a longer appearance, and the way they handled\n          \n        giving it an original twist, i agree its defiantly a masterpiece worth of being right next to the brotherhood reboot, which brings me to my point finally. \nEven with its great story, its a AAA anime, but brotherhood is an AAA+ anime. It's story flowed much more smoothly, it followed the original authors writing which is why it flowed smoothly and Olivia Armstrong is one of the best introductions ever to the show. Loved Her. The humonguli while not born of such darkness was still dark, and the episodes with the doctor and his daughter aren't as horrific and damn near traumatizing as the original. but still impactful and meaningful, and dear god the death of at least my favorite character, \"He who shall not be named as not to spoil\" having to read it watch it, then watch a reboot of it.... triple threat triggered... Hearthbreaking...\n{FMA; BrotherHood Review}\nOk Onto The Main Topic. My First Review Ever, And Maybe My Only One, Because This Is My Top Anime & I've Seen Over 200.\n(Minor Spoilers)\nStory (9/10)\nThe story is great, if you want to know what its about read the description or watch a trailer. But to sum it up, it follows edward elric and his brother alphonse as they try to bring back there lost loved one useing alchemy, which takes a awesome twist on this. And this act has harsh consequences on them both. Mainly the little brother alphonse. And it follows there journey of trying to fix there mistake and heal themselves.\nBut the story gets darker, alchemy used in military and war efforts, for secret agendas, past and future events merge and tell a story that flows wonderfully, between killers, different countries and cultures, although only 2-3 are really focused upon, and a full cast of characters you'll love or hate. \nIt has action, comedy but not to much to ruin the moment, no fan service thank god, except one semi scene or two but there mostly funny or emotional and barely even show or feel off putting. It has violence emotion, and the backstory of everyone is well developed and the way alchemy is explained it almost makes you think its real or at the least wish it was lol.\nMy only complaint is the final fight could of been like three times as long and three times the action and fighting.\nHonestly almost every fighting scene deserved to be twice as long. The episodes deserved atleast 10 minutes extra each just to add fighting because the action scenes were so damn amazing. It left you craving so much more, I would honestly hate it if they went full on DBZ with 20 episode fights but most are only 1-2 episodes or half a episode........ Which would be nice if they were 4-5 Even. \nHonestly the 64 episodes were a perfect length, some think it was to long but I think it was just right,, and I say that because the story itself doesn't need dragged out even though you would like a part 2 or 3 or 5 Lol, to see the other countries. But it still deserves longer action scenes, there so brilliantly layed out and nothing feels like that much of a dues ex machina. No one is indestructible or invincible or pulling crap out of there buttox, Almost everything is explained or somewhat understandable by the pre-set laws explained early on and pretty good detail and it just works great and they deserve more time end of rant. Next section Lol... Sorry not Sorry.\nAlso two things, greed should of got more screen time and character development as the original greed. Because i liked his greedy style and wanting of alot of things i would want lol... If i did something there it wasn't intentional so don't see it, its not really there.\nAnd my Last remark on the story, some of the characters defiantly deserved to die... Mainly the one who died at the end of the original after casting his Alchemy circle. He shares the name of the brother of ----- {semi-spoiler ahead} mufasa in lion king {end of spoiler}\nArt; 10\nThe art of the original anime is dark and gritty as mentioned, but for a 2004 anime id give it a 10 and brotherhood being a reboot obviously has better art and mainly action scenes. which isn't good or bad, it may not be as dark but the alchemy is vibrant and stunning and the action scenes are beyond amazing, the original has amazing action as well but not to these standards and while you wish it was a bit more gritty and dark you still can't deny that its well done.\nThe backgrounds get alot of attention although some scenes have you wanting more, The people while not as flashy as some anime now a days is always nice and there expressions feel real as opposed to starring at a wall or board which is the problem with a lot of anime.\nSound; 9\nI'm no sound expert but everything is handled brilliantly, no scene makes you feel as though the music doesn't belong. Before action scenes everything feels hyped and exciting and edgy. And the payoff is usually good.\nThe characters voices are great and listening to the actors commentary is funny as all hell on the DVD.\nI can't comment on the Japanese version.\nMai chings voice is so annoying... so so so so so annoying, I don't understand why they need whinny voiced female voices,, its drives me insane. I have 2-3 friends 4-8 year old daughters that i see every so often. And none sound that whinny and damn annoying.. She is like my only complaint. That and sometimes other characters voices just sound kind of weak or annoying as well. But that might be clashing with some of the writing and just un-avoidable.\nAlphonse could of sounded more manly at some point towards the end,,, like WTF.\n{Characters} 10\nThe borderline best part of the show the characters, besides the action and story.\n{Edward Elric}\nEdward elric, ya love em, but most hate him. Most like greed like me. I actually relate to Edward so much its really unreal and annoying. But I kinda like the idea because he's one of my favorite anime characters, You get to get inside his head, he's so fleshed out its amazing. A character you either relate to or don't.\nI like him because hes real and honest. Has some sense of moral compass. Acts a fool sometimes, but isn't a total fucking moron like most main anime characters.\nalthough i don't vibe with his take on god and humans all the way. its still relate-able on some basis. His fighting style isn't bad hes kind of hot tempered, but he brings good comedy.\nOverall edwards a great character.\n{Alphonse Elric}\nProbably the second most fleshed out character. He can get annoying, mostly his voice. But hes a good dude, and you root for him. Hes not a master at first, but he defiantly grows and becomes great at alchemy in his own right, kind of hoped he had a pocket watch of his own the entire time.\nI don't relate with him much, but hes a strong and influential character and has a good impact on the story overall. And I enjoyed his presence and the brotherly bond he shares with his brother. And his outlooks and helpful nature.\n{Winry RockBell}\nBlonde beauty, wonderful voice, tsundere? Maybe.... But overall shes a girl who bakes applepies and gets put on the sidelines most of the show. But she seems more impactful on this series than the original but she still is vastly important to both i'd say.\nShe fixes edwards arm most of the time, and leg. Shes rough and hits him a lot, alphonse rarely gets hit. Love her attitude shes wife material lmao, but she does get emotional and some actions aren't as good.\nYou kind of want more screen time for her but she gets enough, its really the focus on the elric brothers that matter in this show so you can't complain to much. She isn't totally useless, sometimes a plot pusher, or device. But her character has a deep personality and her actions speak for her, her story is well fleshed out and she has her own life. As well as her own role to play in the entire Show.\n{Pinako RockBell}\ngrandmother to winry rockbell, funny, adds great humor, her and ed fighting or laughing are just funny to see together, not the biggest role player but she helps the plot cares for the elric brothers like there her own and shes just a wonderful grandmother and women and has a likable personality.\nshes intelligent and has wisdom. and she has known the elrics brothers mom and father a long, time, one episode even though its filler, like the 1st episode which is another great reason why the show is great only 2 filler episodes total.\nIs  a episode where they show her and the elric brothers farther hohenheim in the past, it may be filler but it adds to the plot to show they've none each other a long time and it gives a deep show of there fathers life and his inner thoughts so it may be filler but its honestly only half filler because it matters in some way. its just a bit slower of a episode but defiantly a good one none the less.\n{Hohenheim} \nOhhh the elrics father, probably one of the most ruthless people in the anime, even though hes calm and centered, i enjoyed him almost more than greed. defiantly top 5 if not 3 characters ever and in this anime.\nHe has ruthless alchemy powers but chooses to use them wisely and with constraint for reasons you will later learn are very good ones. hes king and caring and isn't ever almighty and demanding unlike his main counterpart and enemy father the main antagonist of the show although you don't get deep into that till around the middle so I'll say no more.\nhe has a deep and great back story and one that will highly interest you if you're willing to listen. i can't say much without spoiling most of the show.\n{Izumi Curtis}\nAKA Teacher, Which gets annoying that they never call her Izumi towards the end, but i guess thats a formal thing in japan, so I'll sorta let it slide.\nShes great, shes powerful, shes ruthless, and shes kinda like a step mom for the elric brothers but of course she never replaces there mom or trys to its just kind of a family bond. \nShe teachers the elric brothers how to use alchemy and later you learn she has more in common with the elric brothers then originally thought.\nShe also used alchemy to bring back something she loved but in turn lost the very thing she could use to create it. Really moving and emotional story. She has a good role to play in the story as well, a semi main character of sorts. Defiantly a enjoyable one even if shes kinda mean half the time its kinda funny and annoying lol.\n{father}\nHes the main antagonist, and wants to be similar to god. hes an alchemist and a very very old one at that. He's the father of the humonguli And has more power in more then one way or category or area than you think and ill say no more as not to spoil.\n{humonguli}\nThe 7 Sins\nGreed --- My favorite, Has invincible Armour Or the ultimate Shield.\nLust, --- the ultimate spear; a divine black haired beauty borderline goddess but deadly and fucking insane.... to say the absolute least about her...\nGluttony... --- The ultimate stomach??? what more is there to say? oh yeah he has fucking stomach that can eat shit. its like a black hole but like its not,,  its its,,, i don't fucking know... and whats its purpose... Well just watch the show and time will tell all, Lol.\nWrath ---the ultimate eye!!! a partial favorite, you'll discover him soon. I despise his nature and outlook on humans, i despise his prideful and arrogant attitude almost rivaling prides no wonder they were put together as a pair.\nHis sword skills are awesome and his fighting is great, i like his attitude and his confidence and the way he handles himself. Most of what he says is relate-able but his over all personality is little to be desired because hes kind of prick beyond the boundaries of ass-holism.\nPride --- He controls shadows? hes pride, made in the image of his creator father, why? because father wants to be like god i guess. hes a douche, pride is a total asshole who feels he is above everyone else,, more or less yeah the embodiment of pride... hate his character but he has awesome and great fight scenes is smart and has some knowledge and personality of some kind hes an alright character.\nEnvy --- The ultimate envy she or he I'm not sure..... can be anyone or almost anything its mostly one other thing that's horrific sorta but kind of funny looking. but still, awesome fight scenes, but its envy... I'm sure people relate buttttt,, not me i hate envious people, who gives a fuck what they have go get something for yourself and stop being a crybaby.\nSloth; the last one introduced, hes fast, when he needs to be and is the embodiment of sloth, he doesn't wanna do shit unless hes forced to or ordered,, he would probably be the tom sawyer of this show if he wasn't forced to dig dig dig a hole,, or that long from lion king 1 half.. and his brutal size and again scary random speed.\n{Mai Ching & Ling Yao} \nMai Chang --- Shes cool from another country,, her voice is annoying but i like her personality and ideals but her voice makes her easily the most hated character besides pride.\nand her love for the elric brothers is annoying and not needed. Well I'll be honest it kind of does matter towards the end because it helps give the story a good end of sorts.\nAlso Ling Yaos Personal Body Guard Lan Fan, Is Hilarious when her and Mai Ching Fight because of there two Waring countries even though there all the same countries theres 50 kingdoms each ruled by a child of the emperor in ching. And there all competing for a spot on the throne which is why ling yao and mai chang came to amestris. its not a huge spoiler you learn that from the get go when meeting them. \nAnd lan fans grandfather Fu is a cool dude, probably one of the coolest samurai characters ive seen in a very long time, and lan fan is right there with the badassness, honestly i forgot how much i enjoyed her character until now.\nLing Yao  --- i enjoy his company, totally comedic relief, but he gets serious later on and his story gets well developed, i prefer the original greed but hey whatever right... well sorta, he acts different and the new greed is different, but his fight scenes are great even before the change he goes through. hes on the hunt for immortality which is why he deals with this change to greed bullcrappola. but it works out in the end because it does work very well with the story. just some opinions may differ on who you would of liked to be what. he was cooler as just lang yao,,, and greed was better being greed on his own. \n{Scar}\nHe became a badguy because of the war of extermination, riza hawkeye, mae hughes, roy mustand, alex armstrong, all took there part in the war. Along with many others, slaughtering tens of thousands of Ishvalans, the red eyed people. \n{Zolf J. Kimblee}\nAKA - Kimblee, the man who took the most pride in the ishvalan war of extermination, a total asshole beyond bounds and means unbeknownist to the world.\nIf you ever wanted to compare an anime character to hitler, but one who was just a average guy instead of a national leader. This is pretty much it.\nHis alchemy specializes in bombs, and destruction, and mostly more F-ing bombs lol. But out of all the characters in other anime to do explosions, his twisted approach amuses me way more than any other.\n{Alex Louis Armstrong & Olivia Armstrong}\nAlex --- is funny as hell best comedic relief ever, sometimes over doing it, and the background glow is annoying, but his hair loop and stars and everything great being past down the Armstrong family for generations is just pure enjoyment and funny as all hell to most people anyways lol..\nHis character was very enjoyable.\nOlivia --- his sister, is way more serious and her brutality and skill of the sword is awesome i wish i could of seen a few hours of her fighting, it would be ruthless, she is a total bad ass and wife material. I'm not scared of an intimidating woman like Japanese people are, kinda find the viking and ruthless warrior chicks pure greatness and there needs to be more intelligent and skilled woman in anime and even the world such as olivia,, \nVery helpful to the plot and you never really know what she is thinking, just a totally great person. and very fleshed out for the little time she gets.\n{Roy Mustang}\nAgain a favorite but sometimes I disagree with his attitude, its a bit elite sounding and very annoying that he acts in such a way.\nBut hes an awesome guy, his fire alchemy is great, and his love for his country, friends, and his people. And just plain all around everyone is great.\nHe cares, he's relate-able, vengeful, smart, proud, everything.\nI swear all the characters are so fleshed out, they all feel like mains and you just enjoy them all.\n{Riza HawkEye}\nFor fuck sake, how many favorites am i at again?\nRiza is probably the girl i like more than winry or oliva, wonderful women, caring smart, you see the sorrow she went through but shes loyal and cares for roy, shes a sniper and a badass she can stand her ground, but she still has morals regardless of when she has to shut them aside for war.\nI enjoyed alot of her moments with the group.\nAND LASTLY MY FAVORITE\n{Maes Hughes}\nThis character will rip your heart out!!!! NO! dare i say it,,, your... very soul!!!....\nMae hughes is a guy who works with roy mustang, i think i relate to him more than greed or even elric.. almost hawkeye level greatness in character like-ability. Don't care if half the words i use are made up, you get the damn point.\nHe has a daughter and shows her off non stop its funny, winry feels apart of his family and everyone who meets him just becomes friendly as can be, except the most hated character in existence who met him that time..........................................................., he seems real easy to get along with although most view him as a great and scary authority because of his rank.. the elric brothers talk to him like a buddy. which is shocking to the others but id do the damn same hes such a like able guy i almost wanna call him my brother.\nHes smart, progresses the story, his style i can dig it, almost like i dig edwards style except the gloves part which is okward. mae hughes doesn't ware gloves, he wears suits but not to showman ship just casual and chill. its reflects his personality but hes not a business guy just a professional, and hes good at his job helping the elrics and unraveling the main plot but falls into trouble from it. \nHe can fight and hold his ground although we don't get to see enough of him in action, and with that ill continue to the final. Because honestly, I could talk about the characters all damn day.\n{Enjoyment};\nOverall i enjoyed this more so then any anime I've ever watched or any cartoon, the storyline is flawless except for a few people living and some other things you wanted to happen and a few action scenes that could of been longer, double if not triple the length. But the story wraps itself up so nicely you don't care eitherway.\nThe maturity of the show is unparalleled to most others, say for a few comedic moments and kids acting like annoying kids. But its not Bad.\nThe actions is superb and great and my only complaint was that they should of been 30 minutes instead of 10 minutes not 2-4 hours like DBZ but atleast an episode or a few worth of fighting because it deserves it and the possibilities are so great. they could of done amazing just simply amazing things with it.\nI want a part two, but hey its ending is perfect, wouldn't wanna ruin it.\nTheres so much backstory, the characters are so well developed which is where every anime usually fails on most of them at least 99% except the 20 that didn't.\nAnd this one gives them enough story that I could tell you the life story of just about all the characters in the show, at least 20-30 of the 50-80. And you Genuinely care about the characters, nothing is forced, you just naturally start to see there side and care. You learn about them and watch them grow. some deserved more screen time, others not so much. But overall its the best part.\nThe art was great and felt alive and pulled you into the show again the actions scenes flawless and well thought out action packed.  And the sound went along with it great, amping the action and important moments and making it feel more alive and exciting.\n{Overall}\n10 Out Of 10\nCall Me A Fan, but i am not a fan boy, and i never will be, i see the flaws in fullmetal alchemist brotherhood, I see them clear and i accept them. But I don't care what anyone says, you can't deny the fact that its a great show regardless of its flaws.\n...And the only reason it gets hate is because A; people liked the original better for its darker story, Or B there a fanboy or fangirl of another show and refuse to accept another as the better, Or C Because they found one flaw and want to act as though everyone else is wrong and feel special about it, Had someone say dragonball Z is better, but refuses to acknowledge its many flaws, or clannad or SAO, Or attack on titan, and hellsing, and fairy tail, naruto, one peice.\nI can go on and on, its defiantly a matter of opinion as to you favorite.\nAnd I love some of those and others, but at the end of the day.\nFor me the fact is there is not another animated show on earth that you can compare, with this level of emotion, character development, story telling, action, comedy, and a powerful message that no human life is worthless. And the questions that arise from such a story. The show exceeds in all fronts, it has everything you could want in a show..\nYes other shows may have more action, more romance, more characters, more comedy. But no other show Excels in every single field to such a high degree. With such little friction or issues in its story. It was told beautifully, and completely.\nLiterally everything is borderline worthy of a 10 Of 10. It is truly a masterpiece.\n\n"},

The characters are well developed and all of them are like-able, even the villains too. Unlike most animes, the flow of the anime tend to fall off, technically being stagnant like Naruto and SAO. FMA Brotherhood on the other hand is able to keep viewers on screen all time, as the plot line is intriguing and filled with ambiguity in a good way.\nThe soundtrack of the series is arguably the best I have heard in a long time. The first opening and ending is legendary. All in all this a good anime if want to binge watch\n          \n        over the holidays.

I did not enjoy FMAB. I forced myself to finish this show just so I could tell my friend I watched the show. The only real problem I have with this show is the story. I give art a mediocre score because it isn't anything special. The story is what I have a problem with. The very idea of the show/manga is great. I like the idea of alchemy. The story quickly became a predictable straight forward festival of nothingness. I\n          \n        really like shows with plot twists. That is where I find the most excitement in anime and I didn't find it in FMAB. Maybe some twists were when it was revealed who was Wrath and who was Pride. I just did not care. I give points though for when FMAB made me cry at (spoiler) funeral. I thought it was easy to guess what a Philosophers' stone was made of. I don't think this show is worth your time and you don't have to watch this show to be considered a true anime fan. That would be Cowboy Bebop. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    DO NOT watch FMA: Brotherhood without first watching the 2003 adaptation.  The first 13 episodes of Brotherhood are fast paced without drawing the same emotions as the original FMA 03. The show assumes you are familiar with the back stories of the characters and does a very underwhelming job at introducing the Elric Brothers as a characters. This is this shows main drawback. The motives of Edward and Alphonse Elric seem not as valuable as they did in the original. You will have more fun watching the side characters of the show in action then the two leads. Which isn't necessarily a problem but\n          \n        it would have liked to see more impact on their story. While the original series left me emotional in the end, FMA: Brotherhood felt like another DBZ in the last 5-10 episodes which was disappointing. \nOverall the sheer quality and budget of the series shows. The fights definitely are entertaining when they are at appropriate pace. (all but last 10 episodes) With an intriguing plot with an interesting concept creates for a very good anime. I would consider FMA: Brotherhood the king of the Shonen Genre which is why I rate it a 9/10. However, for guys like me who are not fans of Shonens, and prefer emotionally moving stories with more developed characters, then you are better off watching the original FMA. Brotherhood didn't cause me to feel any emotion while watching it. I didn't care about Haughes or Nina when they died. It felt forced. Same with the comedy in this show while its the same as the original, it was much more repetitive and frequent thus becoming annoying and forced. So I would say this show is an 8/10 for people like me. Overall a 9 because its the best in its genre. \n        "},

The plot moves at the perfect rate, almost no filler.  This show kept me guessing and I simply couldn't turn it off.  I had to know why a character was acting a certain way, what their motives were, and what they were doing next.\nThe characters are flawless.  They're diverse and well-rounded.  There's no one-dimensional characters here.  The \"bad guys\" have good qualities, and the \"good guys\" have done terrible, atrocious things.  Nothing is black-and-white.  I found\n          \n        myself getting attached to all of them in different ways, without realizing it until it had already happened.\nThe intercharacter relationships are beautiful and deep.  You can feel the bonds between them.\nThis anime has it all.  Depth, humor, seriousness, sorrow, joy, frustration, love.  It looks into what it means to be human, and what some people will do to preserve the notion of humanity.  It also seriously touches on the issue of what makes a family a \"family\" and it does it in a subtle and not at all cliche way.\nI would recommend this anime to everyone.  Period.\n        "},

So here I am, sucked into the world of Alchemy again.\nMy first impression during the first 13 or so episodes was: Mediocre. I thought it would never ever compare to the earlier adaptation of FMA. Everything seemed TOO fast paced (First time ever for any anime, they're always too slow!). Just about half of the original story was summed up and told in several episodes. \nI considered dropping this new series, but that just could not do. Edward action is\n          \n        too alluring!\nSo I watched on, and with each new chapter my appreciation for this series grew. The story wraps together nicely and branches off into the original Manga version without any sort of bumpy transition. \nI'm looking at all the reviews for FMA Brother and people who've rated it like, 6 or 7, are people who have only watched barely 10 episodes of this series. I have to say that you will NOT come to terms with this series unless you get a gist of its pacing and story development.\nNow for quick reviews.\nStory: 10. I've always loved the old FMA story, and I can't wait to see how the manga one develops (Never read the manga). What saddens me is the lack of involvement with the Homunculi that were VERY significant in the previous FMA.\nArt: 10. It's crisp yet very neutral as a result of using pastel tones. Beautiful especially when you watch it on a HD site 8). I like the use of comedy in the art - ex. making Ed into a beany dude with one piece of hair when he's distressed. \nSound: I like the music, not too picky about this. \nCharacter: 8. I'm hoping there will be more development of the characters; it was kind of hard to grasp the emotions and personalities of many side characters because the story flows very quickly. Some more feeling/empathy in the people would definitely bump the rating of FMA Brotherhood up for me.\nEnjoyment: 10. I definitely love watching this series up to this point. It has NO fillers, and it's just very enjoyable overall because nothing is really BORING and there are many cliffhangers. It rips my heart out to have to stop watching after 3 episodes!\nOverall: 9 so far; may change depending on further analysis of this series. \nGo FMA Brotherhood!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This is one of the most perfect animes I have seen to date.\nThere are discrepancies and unexplained matters, including the main characters, but still the whiole series is golden. Honestly, at times the storyline and images are gross and gory, but if you can watch through all that, you will be able to enjoy all this series has got to offer.\nStory:9\nThe story is amazing and full of surprises, though at times it is kinda sick and inconsistent. But honestly, there is a lot of logic and emotions filled throughout this series so I would say that this is one of the best storylines I have\n          \n        seen. There's a lot of sacrifices, love and a general outlook of our modern world. But it is filled too with hope, especially with the Elric Brothers, and the possibilities of what humans can do.\nFor real life reference, we can refer to what happened to the SARS outbreak, when people all over the world united to fight the airborne deadly diesease. But on a sadder note, when the issue only affects a certain part of people's lives, like how the Ishbalan conflict didn't impact most of the Asmetris' people lives, they did not really care about what happened. This could be referenced to the Ebola virus crisis happening now or other proxy wars fought during the Cold War and so on.\nDespite the realistic references, there were also quite a lot of logical theories like the law of equivalent exchange for alchemy, though it involved a lot of fantasy as well. I felt that the fantasy in this series is what makes things interesting. Just when you think that all hope is lost, there could be another way of looking at things, and to use alchemy. I love how the producers and mangaka streatch the imagination with new possibilities.\nArt:10\nThe studio producing this anime is Bones, so it is quite obvious that most of the action is fluid and good, though there were some blur parts. But the colour is good, not faded out or watery-looking but solid, and animation is really good. The characters' art were also well done and consistent.\nSound:10\nAlthough I did not enjoy some OPs and EDs, (the first and last OPs and EDs were my favs), most if not of them fit the current storylines at that time. Plus the OSTs and sound effects enhanced the scenes they were played on too.\nCharacter:10\nI think that most of the characters were well-developed and some of the side characters even were part of the main storyline even if they initially were small roles. I like how the small characters influence the Elric Brothers and how the 2 of them changed as they encounted new people and events. The other characters, especially the main characters also had some develiopment, whether through past or actions, and fully showed that a good cast of characters can make a series shine.\nEnjoyment:10\nWell, I didn't enjoy the sad or gory parts a lot, but this series is unbelievably touching and thought-provoking, even inspiring. However, there was also funny moments and lots of scenes to laugh.\nOverall:10\nThis is a masterpiece, definitely one of the best action and shounen anime series these few years, what with all the fanservice and filler animes recently. In these 64 episodes, it is hard to believe how much real and good content has been shown. The other anime that gave me this feeling is Sword Art Online, but mainly the first 12 or so episodes for the first arc.\n        "},

Why do I mention both series? Well,I cant view them separately,to me FMA and FMAB are one and together they create the greatest work in anime history. Before getting any further I find it necessary to thank the creator,Hiromu Arakawa for just being a genius,because my sloth doesnt let me write another review for the manga alone. Thank You.\n Now\n          \n        to the topic. Fullmetal Alchemist the manga and two anime adaptations are something every one should behold. The story is phenomenal and offers number of philosophical questions,interesting and unique characters,beautiful and realistic world,and a magnificent plot,yet the real beauty of this magic is in the detail and the base of the work. To start off,the world of Fullmetal Alchemist is based on early 20th century world,and the main action is going on in Amestris,which is the counterpart of 20th century Europe. Early 20th century was the darkest period of time for all the world and all the humanity,so this replica is very interesting in itself. And I'm sure everyone already guessed what Ishbal is a reference to. But what is the genius of it,everybody knows that 20th century was the start of the technological and scientific progress that would change the world entirely,so this woman went ahead and put Alchemy as the base concept of the world. Alchemy,from which the roots of science emerge. That is a genius move, and makes the world not only much more greater,but much more deeper also. \n The characters are the best,everyone has a unique personality,everyone makes their own impact on the development of the story, and everyone themselves are very cautiously developed. All of the characters have their own philosophy,the best example are the Elric Brothers. Edward Elric is my favorite character and is actually the best character in anime. The reason is Nietzsche and his famous work \"Thus spake Zarathustra\". The story of Zarathustra created this \"ubermensch\" concept,which means \"overman\". And here's where Arakawa really shines the brightest, ubermensch is a tricky concept, it has two sides,like Dionysus,it can fool some by making them believe that the ubermensch is the concept of the last man,the one that can have nothing after himself,and is a \"perfect being\". The Last man was Father,who gave up humanity for his own power and his desire to become perfect. But Arakawa gives us the real meaning of ubermensch in the character of Edward Elric, he confronts the negating nature of the last man,and becomes the real ubermensch by giving up power for the sake of love,hope and friendship. He takes a step forward in the evolution of humanity,truly \"overman\" . Edward and Alphonse break the law of equivalent exchange with their ideals. And we have everyone else: Hohenheim,Mustand,Riza,Hughes,Scar and many others,but I'd like to mention the seven deadly sins the most,antagonists like no other,these characters were the  big part why FMA is so great,and greatly depict Dante's comedy,and add yet another great basis to the story. The Truth,or God is another reason for the greatness of this work, I adore the way they managed this character,and the symbolism they used on depicting the meaning of the character.\n One of the best things in Brotherhood is the Homeric atmosphere,which makes the viewer feel like they're reading the Iliad,and all the characters are Greek heroes or Gods and Godesses. The story slowly but surely builds towards the climax,which takes the big chunk of the series,the 20 episode ending is another reason of the comparison to Homer.\n The music is phenomenal,FMA has the best soundtrack in anime,both series shine greatly in this aspect: Brothers,The Atonement,Aisetsu,Beaming Sunlight,The Journey's End,Soldier's Honor,Trisha's Lullaby and many more amazing works sweeten the sound of this great work.\n The animation in it's turn is epic,beautiful,fluent and stunning. Thanks to Studio Bones.\n But the greatest thing of this work is the message of it,the real reason why it's so great is what it leaves for the viewer moving forward, a Fullmetal heart, a belief in humanity, faith and hope. \nFullmetal Alchemist/ Fullmetal Alchemist Brothehood is the greatest work since Nietzsche and maybe the last great work created by human hand. That's why it's more than anime,it's a work for all and none. \n        "},

While it was unique, it suffered from a bad ending and many other problems. Years later Studio Bones decided to redo the series, following the original story in a much more faithful way.\nStory: Set in a fictional world where Alchemy exists, the Elric brothers attempt to bring their deceased mother back to life by using the forbidden human transmutation.

No character is useless or pointless, and every character gets a period of time to shine. The story itself keeps you entertained the whole time and rarely ever feels dull. The writing helps sell the the series and it's well paced story keeps you guessing with some great twists.\nArt: The animation is done by Studio Bones and it's simply great. The animation captures the effects and mood perfectly and the animation is consistently good.

The voice acting is amazing, and the dub is hands down one of the single best dubs ever put on TV. It captures the characters so much better then the 03 verison and the newcomers fit right at home.\nCharacters: As I said, their honestly well done. The heroes are likable, the villains are interesting and enjoyable and they all stand out. Roy Mustang, Ling Yao, Riza Hawkeye, and the Armstrong siblings are notable examples of strong, developed characters.\n Enjoyment: I'll be brief: I enjoyed every second.\nFinal Verdict: Please watch this show.

But it is not a flawless medium. In order for an anime series to succeed, effort of equal value and money must be given. That is how the Anime Industry works, but what could equal the value of a Masterpiece?\n\nThe time is at hand for me to review… FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST: BROTHERHOOD!\n\n\nTwo brothers lose their mother to an incurable disease. With the power of\n          \n        \"alchemy\", they use a forbidden art of alchemy to resurrect her. The process fails, and the Elric Brothers pay a toll for performing the ultimate taboo, the older brother, Edward Elric loses his left leg while the younger brother, Alphonse Elric loses his entire body. To save his brother, Edward sacrifices his right arm and is able to attach his brother's soul to a suit of armor. With the help of a family friend, Edward receives metal prosthetics (which are known as “Automail”)  to replace the limbs he lost. With that, Edward makes a solemn vow to search for the Philosopher's Stone to return the brothers to their original bodies, even if it means becoming a \"State Alchemist\", one who uses his/her alchemy for the military, thus beginning the journey for the Elric Brothers.\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a BONES production and this is not a remake of Fullmetal Alchemist. This is the second adaptation of Hiromu Arakawa’s Manga Masterpiece. The 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist series was based on the manga but as the second half came around, it deviated from the source material and went its own direction and had its own conclusion.. Now the synopsis I gave is pretty much the same synopsis I gave when I reviewed the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime, that is because Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has the same premise as the original anime. I should note that in Japan, the series is simply called FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST. The “Brotherhood” subtitle is actually added for international purposes to prevent confusion. The animation in the original anime still holds up, and it was a solid effort by BONES at the time. With Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, there is obviously a different character design style used here. The character designs in the original FMA anime look nice and still look good. However, the character designs are more polished in Brotherhood. I think it’s nice for both series to have distinct character design styles. The animation as a whole is another different case. Because of the huge success of the 2003 series, it looks pretty clear that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was given an insane budget. This was also a production made for television, not an OVA production. If this was an OVA Series, it would look about the same due to its high budget. Hell! I think the animation quality in this anime is on par with the usual Madhouse television production. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood looks phenomenal. There are very few shortcuts made but I have to address the only nitpick I have with this series. The “Chibi humor” moments. There are times where the characters suddenly look deformed in any shape or form. This is an issue that a number of people have with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I see where they are coming from but I am aware that the original 2003 anime had some humorous moments in some episodes when some of those episodes had serious moments in them too. If you ask me, Brotherhood feels a little excessive on the “Chibi” effect while using comic relief, then again. The manga had its own sense of humor. This kind of humor is typical in anime and it is used more often with the Elric Brothers than other characters and The Elric Brothers are teenagers. Even though that sounds like an excuse. I forgive this oddly timed humor because it decreases as the series progresses. The animation as a whole is consistent, it remains some of the best looking animation when it comes to Modern Anime, it also had incredible animation when it came to its action scenes. This anime is also subdued when it comes to scenes of dialogue. It is still nice to look at and the animation is well-balanced. Even though great animation alone does not constitute a great show, I consider Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood to be BONES’ greatest achievement to date. Most of today’s anime are nowhere on-par with the production values of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood because like I said before, it looks phenomenal as a television production for an anime.\n\nThe music by Akira Senju may take a little getting used to. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is completely orchestral from start to finish (save for the opening and closing themes). I looked up Akira Senju to see what he has worked on before or since this show and he’s not really well-known in the anime community except for this one and still to this day, he’s not really a big name when it comes to Anime composers. Even though I like the soundtrack from the original 2003 series, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood’s soundtrack is just as good and a lot more fitting. Sure, there were some great stuff from Michiru Oshima in the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime, but when it came to the soundtrack to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, it is not just epic but it has its emotional elements that make the soundtrack stand out. Most of it is instrumental of course but when some themes have lyrics, they are all in Latin. Anyway, the soundtrack fits the series and it is nice to know that not only did Akira Senju compose the music but he did it with the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra as well as the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. The Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra has recorded music for animes like Cowboy Bebop, The Vision of Escaflowne, and Hellsing: Ultimate. They don’t disappoint with their involvement with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. As for openings and closings. “Again” by Yui is a damn catchy song that is a nice opening to start the series. “Uso” by SID is a nice closing considering it fits the early stages of the series. The second opening “Hologram” by Nico Touches the Walls is a great too. “Let it Out” by Miho Fukuhara is a closing which does look and sound great. “Golden Time Lover” is an opening I originally did not care for but I grew to like it after a while. “Tsunaida Te” (Tied Hands) by Lil’B is a closing theme that I don’t much to say about but as a closing that is right in the middle, it’s fitting. “Period” by Chemistry is a great penultimate opening and “Shunkan Sentimental” (Sentimental Moment) by Scandal is a great penultimate closing. The fifth and final opening “Rain” by SID is a very effective opening because what happens at the last 14 episodes really fit the opening. As for “Ray of Light” by Shoko Nakagawa, it is a good swan song for the series. The soundtrack is well-balanced, that is all I can say about the music for Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\n\nWith the Japanese Cast, Romi Park and Rie Kugimiya return as Edward and Alphonse Elric and they are both fine as always. There are  a lot of good seiyus such as Shinichiro Miki as Scar, Keiji Fujiwara as Hughes, Kenta Miyake as Scar, Hidekatsu Shibata as King Bradley, Hiroyuki Yoshino as Kimblee, Mamoru Miyano as Ling Yao, Unsho Ishizuka as Van Hohenheim, and others seiyus that make the series fascinating to watch this series Subtitled. However, as good as the Subtitled Version is… I must confess that I strongly preferred the English Dub with this one. Vic Mignogna returns as Edward Elric and even though he was great in the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime, this performance is what I consider to be his greatest. Enough said, Aaron Dismuke originally played Alphonse in the original FMA anime but thanks to him going through puberty, he is unable to play Alphonse in this series. Instead, Alphonse was voiced by Maxey Whitehead and though I understand the situation, I actually like Maxey Whitehead’s portrayal of Alphonse, so I have no complaints here. Caitlyn Glass is just as good with Winry in this series like when she voiced her before in the 2003 series. Travis Willingham did a phenomenal performance. Colleen Clickenbeard is just as precise as Hawkeye and Chris Sabat is awesome as Alex Louis Armstrong. J. Michael Tatum is terrific as Scar. Todd Haberkorn is also terrific as Ling Yao. You wanna know who else is terrific in the dub?  Ed Blaylock as King Bradley, his performance is phenomenal. Laura Bailey, Chris Cason, Wendy Powell, and Chris Patton return as Lust, Gluttony, Envy, and Greed and they are just as good since the first series. John Swasey was spot-on as Hohenheim, and Kent Williams is great as Father and he is not that bad as a narrator. Also, Troy Baker is in the dub and he’s great too. I may have skimmed through the Subbed Version but I am not holding back on how well-casted the dub is in this series. Maxey Whitehead can take a little getting used to for some but she stood out pretty well as Alphonse. Even though Cowboy Bebop has what is considered one of the greatest Dubs ever made, I consider Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood to be Funimation’s greatest Dub and I also consider it to be Mike McFarland’s best Dub he has ever worked on.\n\nWhat really makes Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood such a strong series is its characters. The Elric Brothers, Edward and Alphonse were great characters in the 2003 series but what they did at the end of the original anime was touching but a little less rewarding (and the Conqueror of Shamballa didn’t help). In Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I really was engrossed in the journey that the Elric Brothers took without the slow pacing and backtracking that the first series did early on. As for the military side, Roy Mustang may have been a tragic hero in the first series but his character feels more believable in Brotherhood. plus… He was awesome. Hawkeye is nearly identical, but with more insight. Alex Louis Armstrong is still awesome, and Maes Hughes… Well… he serves a great purpose to the plot. Scar was fine in the original but the plot in Brotherhood really makes Scar an understandable character. Ling Yao is a great comic relief character but he also has a rather interesting character arc to boot. Last but not least is Hohenheim. In the original series, he appeared for only 3 episodes and only has a small timeframe in The Conqueror of Shamballa. I  found Hohenheim’s role to be lackluster in the original. I might as well state the obvious that  Hohenheim was fleshed out and much more detailed in Brotherhood. Then of course there is the Homunculi. Lust was interesting in the original series and well… she’s not the same way in Brotherhood but she does live up to her name. Gluttony lives up to his name. Envy’s role is executed better in Brotherhood whereas his role in the original felt rather anticlimactic. Greed’s character arc is a lot more fascinating in Brotherhood, I was not impressed with Greed in the original. Sloth made no damn sense in the original, Sloth lives up to his name, then there are Wrath and Pride… Well... Let’s just say that they are played out much better than the original series because I felt there was a bit of a mix-up in the original with those two. Then of course there is the main antagonist. In the original, it was Dante (a woman) and even though she had some interesting insight, I was not impressed with her as a villain. The main antagonist in Brotherhood was an interesting case but I would rather remain silent and let you figure out for yourself. The reason I mention all these characters is because there is an incredible level of dynamics that I really don’t see much in anime. There are a lot of characters that have a purpose in the series and the payoff is worth it. These characters develop, these characters have depth, these characters are three-dimensional, and these characters do mature. There is great amount of catharsis, and The character writing is phenomenal.\n\nNot only is the characters written so well, but so is the story. Before I go about the story, let me clear this out right away. The first 3 episodes of the original are fantastic and this is something I wish was repeated in Brotherhood. However, I am not fond of how Episodes 4-9 of the original take up 6 episodes of backstory (after the “Mother” episode) just to get back to the main story. Also, there were a couple filler episodes that really didn’t add up to the story. In Brotherhood, the first episode may be seen as an awkward start but I actually grew to like the episode. It may be an anime-exclusive episode but it distincts itself from the original anime. Sure, some events in Brotherhood play a lot faster when compared to the 2003 series but I also had my minor dislike for the chronology plays out in the original series. Brotherhood does not have any of that although there are backstories that take up a couple episodes here and there and they do not take away from the main focus of the story.  What made Fullmetal Alchemist a wonderful franchise was addressing its themes. Family still plays a part in Brotherhood but I see some camaraderie often with this one. I will say that the Brotherly love between Edward and Alphonse remains one of the more endearing elements of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. There is definitely a lot more focus in relationships which actually do feel natural as the series progressed. Like the original series, Brotherhood has some Philosophy in it and it has some nice philosophical touches. Another thing it does touch upon is Religion.  When I watched the original series, I found the topic of Religion to be painted with a negative light and there was never a positive side to address alongside it. Heck, even Christianity was directly referenced and it was referred to as an ancient religion. I did not like this for two reasons, I felt it was a little offensive for some viewers, and two... It feels really strange that Christianity was brought up in the series considering the plot twist near the end of the 2003 series. With Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, the only negative view on Religion is the Liore event with the example being Cornello. Even I know not all churches are perfect. I would even argue that there is a positive view on Religion but not in a Religious way but rather a Spiritual one. I am referring to “Truth”. Who goes by many aliases such as The World, or The Universe, but the key name I would keep in mind is “God”. Truth is Omnibenevolent, Omnipotent, Omniscient, and Omnipresent, Truth punishes the unjust, and upholds the Law of Equivalent Exchange and gives those that are arrogant, prideful, and boastful, proper despair. After reading into the description of Truth, I am going to take a wild guess that Truth is meant to be Fullmetal Alchemist’s representation of God. I do like how Truth’s role is kept vague throughout the series but I always found this part of the series fascinating. There are many facets of Life that are addressed and even the phrase “survival of the fittest” plays a part in this series too. There is a lot of interesting subtext in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Although Christianity was directly referenced in the original series and on a negative light, there is some Christian imagery in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood that actually fits some of the symbolism in the series. Especially considering that the Seven Homunculi are named after The Seven Deadly Sins and the main antagonist can be viewed as an analogue to Satan if you really think about where the main antagonist comes from and his motives and goal. The Flamel Cross is a little vague on the subject but I am glad that the Christian symbolism isn’t used to throw in at the viewer’s face… like Neon Genesis Evangelion for example. Even if there is some Christian symbolism, it is nice to see a balance of complex themes and imagery as well as showing many facets of the human condition  to make the story of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood relatable to the audience.  I really do not want to delve too deep in the plot because this is a series that you really need to see for yourself. I will say that it is a satisfying experience.  Yasuhiro Irie has not done much in terms of directing and this happened to be the second series he directed. What made this anime great is largely thanks to the writing but even though a barely known anime director undertook the task of directing the second adaptation of a well-written manga and he managed to direct a Modern Gem. This journey all started in 2001 when Hiromu Arakawa created a world much like our own and the world she created was filled with memorable and timeless characters. It took her 9 years to finish her Magnum Opus and gave BONES the opportunity to make an anime based on that Magnum Opus.\n\nThere is no such thing as a perfect anime, it doesn’t exist. The same goes with other mediums, anything made by human hands is flawed. Mistakes do happen but they can be corrected or excused. Although, if you can understand that principle and appreciate something for the good and bad while it remains focused and true, you’ll find that you now have a mind that can be refined to have a better understanding in appreciating what you enjoy. Yes… A mind made fullmetal.\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is available by Funimation, The Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood OVA collection is also available by Funimation which also includes the “Comic Theater” extras which are worth watching if you want a good laugh. Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos is also available by Funimation. Last but not least, Hiromu Arakawa’s magnum opus Manga is available by Viz Media.\n\nWell, I sure have said a lot about this one and overall… Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is phenomenally animated for a Television production in Anime. It has an orchestral soundtrack that fits the series as well as having good opening and closing themes. The Japanese cast may have some great casting but the Dub is also phenomenal too. It also has timeless characters that are dynamic and unforgettable, Not many well-known anime staff worked on the series and yet it has an unforgettable journey contained in its plot. This anime is a miracle with how it all turned out. Now that I look back, I am thankful for the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime because thanks to it… an Anime Masterpiece was made possible. I am also happy to tell you that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is my all-time favorite anime.\n\n\nThat being said, I am giving FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST: BROTHERHOOD a 10 OUT OF 10!!!\n\n\nFeel free to leave a comment and All is One, One is All.\n        "},

Although I've never read the anime, this one was supposed to be more based off of it. The first one ended in a strange way for my tastes and although I have yet to finish brotherhood, I'm bracing myself for an epic end. Everything about this series is good.

THAT'S JUST THE BACKSTORY! see one of brotherhood's greatest strengths is it's story, but the story always builds on itself giving you much to learn and much to discover. each arc contains a mystery mixed with well placed action, and characters to die for. the pacing for the show is another highlight to mention as the show is 64 episodes and it never feels like it drags, or that it feels like it's too long at all. so needless to say, the story is freaking amazing.\nart and animation: 8/10\nthe art and animation is solid for brotherhood, as it is done by studio bones, who's reputation should be enough in and of it's self. but the thing that you have to remember is, well, it's shounen, and shounen has a very particularly unique style. so the animation is average with a little crisp in there. however the setting of wherever the show is at is pretty impressive because this show takes place in just about two billion different locations, the art for the setting really felt surreal to me. which is impressive because the quality is consistent from start to finish. so props to the art and animation.\nsound: 9/10\nthe sound department is pretty cool, as it shines very well in this show. all the openings, and by that i mean all four of them, are very enjoyable, they are awesome, very fitting for the show, my personal favorite being the first opening, again by yui. although all the openings are equally as good, that is just my personal favorite, as i sat through each one all the time, which is very impressive to me, because 99% of shows have one, good opening in the beginning, and then crap out with there second, making you skip it... THIS ONE HAD FOUR AWESOME OPENINGS! as far as the dub vs sub debates go, i personally prefer the dub of this show as funimation as usual put there A game for it. vic does an amazing edward elric and you never would know it but the actor that does alphonse is actually different, but he sounds exactly the sam, but the sub of the show was good too, so really, it's down to personal preference.\ncharacters: 10/10\nthe characters of brotherhood, or fullmetal in general, are absolutely fantastic! personally to me they made the show, everyone from the main characters to the supporting characters are awesome to watch. everyone from roy mustang to scar to the elric brothers and back, are awesome characters with each of them getting great character development,  and rich entertainment. not one character felt out of place, and the badass's that the show has made those characters shine just as much. so needless to say, with every character serving a great purpose, good guys, bad guys and side characters included, they are the best part of the show, hands down.\nenjoyment and overall: 10\nbrotherhood is just a masterfully well written piece of work, and it is undoubtedly worth the watch, but now we get to my minor complaints. see one complaint i have with the show is that they would try to fit in humor where it didn't need it. fox faces and flat out stupid faces were added in at a lot of times when it didn't really need it. the second complaint is kind of a follow up to the last one, but the show with it's amazing story really didn't feel like it took itself seriously sometimes, but that was very far and few between so this was just something small i had to bring up as it did annoy me. but since this show is epic enough, it makes up for it in spades! it is a must watch, and if your an anime fan, just watch it and believe me, you'll have a roller coaster of a time!"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Fullmetal Alchemist was one of my first series that I'd gotten interest in when I first started watching Anime and reading Manga. I'd watched the original FMA series before this one, expecting it to follow the manga (which I'd finished before watching anything FMA related), and while it was a good piece in it's own right, Brotherhood sat with me so much better.\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood follows the manga very closely, with a similar art style and the same dynamic as the manga. If you prefer seeing anime that follows a manga, skip the first generation and come to this one, you won't be disappointed.\nAnyhow, looking\n          \n        at the Anime itself, FMA:B quite frankly was beautiful to me. You have strong lead characters, the traveling brothers Edward and his younger brother Alphonse Elric, who are alchemists that have committed the worst possible Alchemic sin. Because of this, Edward is missing an arm and a leg, and Alphonse is merely a soul bound to a suit of armor. Edward makes it his goal to bring back Alphonse's body and make him human again.\nIn their travels, they meet many different people and face many different challenges, facing their flaws and helping others while sticking to their morals and staying focused on their goal. \n Alchemy in this show is not necessarily the Alchemy you learn about in your chemistry class, but a more give-and-take magic, which is a very interesting twist on the otherwise not-too-exciting idea.\nTheir serious situation and setting is sometimes offset with hilarious moments to help keep it from getting too heavy for a teenage audience. The humor is usually in place very well, and despite sometimes being a bit random, it isn't so awfully out of place that it ruins the moment. The humor can range from silly banter (ie picking on a character for their height, picking on them for their taste in food, etc), to humor that's a little more on the dark side that still manages to fit into the situation nicely.\nThe music in this show is absolutely wonderful and fits the setting very well. The soundtrack is almost if not fully orchestrated, and each tune that plays in each scenario fits beautifully and helps push the point across. It covers a wide range of emotions and energy, and oftentimes is great for listening to even without the manga when you need the inspiration.\nOverall, I enjoyed FMA:B to the point where I was crying over the characters and feeling a wide range of emotions. All of the characters were so well-done and fleshed out, that they will stick with you for a long time after you watch it.\n        "},

But everyone wants something they don't have.\" - Greed\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is probably one of the highest acclaimed animes I've ever seen ever. Though being the later adaptation that stayed true to the manga, I'm confident to say that this series' reputation is well deserved. \nStory: For those of you who haven't tried following FMA manga or the first animation series, the story is about two brothers (Edward and Alphonse Elric) who committed taboo by trying to revive their dead mother using Alchemy. As a result, Ed lost his left leg while Alphonse lost his\n          \n        whole body leaving his soul behind. In an attempt to save Alphonse's soul, Ed then sacrificed his right arm to place his brother's soul on a suit of armor. Together, they decided to do all they can to bring their original bodies back. \nThough the story might seem ordinary, the challenges they encounter to bring their bodies back is beyond beautiful. This series is an intricate weave of reality and fantasy and viewers won't have to worry of dreadful cliches.\nArt: The art of this series doesn't show candy eyed characters, pastel hairs, or awe inducing magic filled fight scenes but viewers will sure love the crisp simplicity that is served. There are times when the quality seems to drop a bit but not enough to be such a big deal. One thing to take note of this series is it's ability to produce easy to remember characters (even if almost all of them wears the same outfits ) without the whole color-coding some series follow these days.\nSound: The series showcases five different opening and ending themes throughout, coming from big artists such as Yui, Nico Touches the Walls, Shoko Nakagawa and Scandal. There isn't much need for insert songs and music for the show but when they do, they make sure that the music matches the mood of the scene. Glad t say that there are no disturbing and unneeded sounds as those can be distracting.\nCharacters: When watching any shows, my main focus is on the characters, no matter how bad the story is,if the characters are interesting enough then it's a yes for me so I am really really pleased the FMA:Br exceeded my expectations. From the very start of the series until the end, no character was wasted. Everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY is essential to the story. The protagonists are really likeable. Ed as the main is not your typical hero, his personality is very well balanced. Same goes for the loveable Al. The supporting characters lives up well to their roles and gives the necessary boosts for the main, all while maintaining their own individuality. The antagonists for me are such delights. I want to spoil so badly, but let me just end this and say that viewer's will probably love everyone in this show. \nOverall . FMA:Br is a must watch. Every factors compliment each other making it truly unforgettable. Viewers won't have to worry that FMA might be a drag because of the rather high episode count. No episode is wasted (that means no fillers for us, YAY!) and at the end, you'd probably be aching for more. \n        "},

I’m not a fan of science, military or shounen but Hagaren perfectly mixed these genre to suit my liking. I love how there is fantasy in military, drama in action, science in history and comedy in a tragedy. \nThe darkness and brightness of the story is balanced. One thing that made me really love this anime is that, there are no fillers at all. Each side stories\n          \n        are deeply connected to the main plot. The 64-long series was never boring. I got so hooked I can’t even wait for the next episode to come out. \nThe two main protagonists, Edward and Alphonse, are likeable. I hated Edward at first because of what happens to their bodies but as the story progress, I ended up cheering for the brothers. There are many characters in Hagaren but all of them has a significant role. Everyone help the protagonists discover the secret of alchemy. \nI love the animation. I’m not really picky with art but Bones did Hagaren so there’s nothing more to say. The voice actors/actresses did their part really well. Each voice match perfectly with the characters’ personalities. The expression and feelings are well delivered. The soundtrack is also great with YUI, SCANDAL and Shouko Nakagawa songs in it. I like how they change the OP and ED theme to match with the current ‘chapter’ of the series. Everything goes well together and it gets you really in the mood. \nI definitely enjoyed Hagaren. The excitement, the tears, the thrill and suspense, the mystery and tragedy will forever be missed. Though I felt that the 24-minute episodes are kinda short, each episode still has the depth I’m looking for in an anime episode. I enjoy the roller coaster feel from episode 1 to episode 64. This anime is worth the watch and re-watch. I don’t remember how many times I watched this but even so, I never got bored and the same feelings resurfaces everytime I re-watch this. \nOverall, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood or Hagaren will still hold the TOP spot in my list. It may have some flaws but truth is, no anime has ever get to the same level of Hagaren.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Warning possible Spoilers\nFor a long time I've been looking for that anime that would truly blow me away and after watching 64 amazing episodes I have finally found that anime\nThe story is about Edward and Alphonse Elric who had an accident with Human Transmutation when they were kids which ended up costing them dearly, now as state alchemists they have set out on a journey to get back their bodies.\nThe story was absolutely amazing, it had very well done pacing I never once got bored or uninterested because once the situation started to settle a bit it just blew me away with a plot twist\n          \n        and this how has so many plot twists my brain couldn't take it, it was that good. It was very interesting seeing how Alchemy worked and what you should or shouldn't do with it like when Ed and Al tried to use Human Transmutation to bring back their mother which led to them almost losing their lives with Ed losing his left leg and right arm while Al lost his entire body and his soul had to be put into a suit of armour just to stay alive. Watching the journey the Elric brothers had to take was exciting and the amount of effort and sacrifice they had to make made you want them to succeed in their quest to get back their bodies, It's been a long time since I have watched an anime that has completely satisfied me like this one.\nThe characters were done so amazingly well hell even the villains were done well and that is quite a rare site for me.\nI loved the chemistry between the Elric brothers they would always watch each others backs and had a lot of morals meaning they wouldn't stoop to levels that involved murder to get back their bodies so you would respect these characters decisions most of the time, Ed has a temper especially when people call him short and his reactions were always hilarious while Al is more kind and level headed than Ed and thinks more with his brain than his fists, both brothers are fiercely protective of their friends and even random people they meet on their adventures showing the good hearts they have.\nThere is a huge amount of characters in this show and there are some who really do stand out like Roy Mustang who is a fire alchemist and he along with many other characters is a troubled soul from his actions in the Ishvalan civil war and he sets out to become the new fuhrer to change things so he is a very honorable person and a badass too from his fights with Lust and Envy where he completely annihilated them, but he is a caring leader and cares for his friends and the soldiers under his command.\nRiza Hawkeye is a marksman among the alchemists and is Roy's most trusted subordinate and both of them do have a close relationship, Riza is a strict, but kind woman and is willing to do whatever it takes to protect the people she cares about.\nWinry Rockbell is the childhood friend of both Ed and Al, she was the one who created Ed's metal arm and leg so he can move around and do his alchemist business, she cares alot for Ed and Al since they are family to her considering her parents died, although she does have a temper much like Ed which is definitely shown when they end up surviving deadly battles.\nThe Armstrong Duo Alex and Mira are strong and respectful soldiers who are willing to put their lives on the line to protect their soldiers, but they are a little different Alex is more soft-hearted while Mira is tough and is a force to  be reckoned with.\nLing Yao is a prince from Xing who is trying to find the secrets of immortality to save his clan and become emperor, despite being a bit clumsy he is very skilled at combat and believes the most important thing is the people around him.\nLan Fan and Old Man Fu are Ling's bodyguards who accompany him to Central, they are fiercely loyal to Ling and use a wide array of weapons to defeat their opponents.\nMay Chang is another character from Xing searching for immortality to save her clan except she is very intelligent, very skillful at martial arts and knows the art of Alkahestry, she can also be an adorable character when she interacts with Alphonse since she develops a crush on him, she also has her Panda Shao may who is an adorable sidekick for May since she mimics her actions and has very funny reactions to certain things.\nMae Hughes is a Lieutenant Colonel, a family man and a friend of Roy Mustang, he is a very funny person often exclaiming jokes with his friends.\nIzumi Curtis is the one who teached Ed and Al how to use Alchemy and ended up having the same fate as them in the past, she is a tough woman and shouldn't be underestimated in a fight.\nVan Hohenheim is the father of Ed and Al, he is a very troubled person and is actually immortal so he left the Elric brothers so can find a way to be mortal and be a father to them until his enemy the Homunculus made him concentrate on other things.\nThen there is Scar a survivor of the Ishval civil war who is looking for revenge, but over the course of the show he does see the error of his ways and builds a new found respect for the people he meets and fights with.\nThere are a lot of villains in this show which are named after the Seven Deadly Sins and they are all difficult to kill since they have regenerative powers except King Bradley who ages like a normal human, they were all created by the Homunculus or Father as they call him who wants to consume God so he can rule the world with his powers.\nThe Artstyle for this anime was done very well the powers that the alchemists used were impressive, destructive and were all different which was nice seeing the different variety of powers each alchemist had, the locations where the show was set were pretty cool like from the cold mountains on the Dachma border to the boiling deserts that separate Central and Xing to the nice countryside of the Elric brothers hometown.\nThe action was done brilliantly the battles were really entertaining to watch ranging from gunfights to alchemy battles there was a lot of destructive and it was really interesting seeing how the good guys would beat the bad guys like when Ed and Ling were sucked into Gluttony's belly and had to figure a way out or when they would fight to the near point of death and you would wonder how they would get out of this situations.\nThere is also a lot moments where there is comedy and it was done brilliantly because the jokes that were around in the show didn't wear out like when Ed keeps being called short or when they anger someone like Izumi, Winry or Mira, it was very funny, but that doesn't say it has it's sad moments because people do die like Hughes and lust who in my opinion were killed off too early and the eventual moment Ed returns Al to the real world was tear jerking scene.\nOverall I absolutely loved this series and is something every anime fan should watch because it is amazing, full of brilliant characters, epic battles and more plot twists than you can imagine you'll certainly have a wonderful adventure watching this anime.\n        "},

Seeing as the original Fullmetal Alchemist is the first anime I have ever completely watched and is the spark that ignited my obsessive love of anime that I have today, a redo seemed unnecessary to say the least. What could possibly be improved upon a show as fantastic as Fullmetal Alchemist? \nWith hesitation and doubt in my heart\n          \n        I started watching the series... and instantly hated it. I won't lie, my first impressions were not only that the show didn't live up to the original, but that it was also an abomination that was dancing on the grave of a greater show. \nI cried, I screamed, I broke things, I didn't do any of the above because I'm exaggerating and not actually crazy, but I was still quite upset. The criticisms bubbled up inside me until I was frustratingly glaring at the TV appalled at such changes as Alphonse's voice actor, or a lack of the opening starting with the classic \"in those days, we really believed...\" lines from Al. \nWith each passing episode the insults to Fullmetal Alchemist seemed to grow, episodes that were lovingly crafted in the original series were apparently being lightly brushed on. Moments in the original that got me hooked fell flat in Brotherhood, and I was fed up and ready to write the letter of complaint to end all letters of complaint. But then, my eyes began to open. \nRight around episode 13 where the plot of the two animes separates I started to think that this story might actually be good. As the episodes began to fly I realized that it wasn't good, it was great. After finishing the series I knew without a doubt in my mind that what I had witnessed was my favorite anime of all time. The story of Brotherhood is better than that of the original on so many levels that the two shows truly don't compare. After having my eyes opened I was forced to drop the rating that I gave to the original to an 8 simply because now I knew how much lost potential it had. \nIf you enjoyed the story of Fullmetal Alchemist, stick with Brotherhood and I guarantee you that you will not regret it. Not only is the plot and storyline vastly improved upon and more satisfying, the animation, music (in my opinion at least, some disagree), characters, and overall feel is far better. \nTherefore, if you are a true fan of the original series don't give up on Brotherhood after only a few episodes like I was so tempted to do, it is a show that grows into something that will go down in history as one of the greats of animation history and you shouldn't miss out.\n        "},

IT IS OUTRAGEOUS. DON'T BOTHER READING THEM.\n*SPOILERS FOR BOTH FMA AND FMA:B*\nHey, This is my first review and i'll be talking a bit about FMA: brotherhood. I decided to watch both FMA and FMA: Brotherhood and I must say, it was a  pleasure. \nFMA(original) had an unique storyline and ending. The story did not follow the manga towards the later part of the series. I felt the story mainly focused on finding the philosopher stone. Along the way, viewers get to see a stronger\n          \n        connection between Al and Ed. There was also more emphasis on Scar and the Homunculi's life and experiences. They barely touch upon Hohenheim (Ed and Al's dad) which I thought had a large role in the story. I got a bit bored of the story towards the end because it got confusing and didn't seem to flow properly. The ending was unique and good, but it did not satisfy viewers and it was kind of a cliff hanger even if you watched the movie. 8/10\nFMA: Brotherhood followed the manga, and it seemed to aim more towards \"mainstream\" animes. FMA: Brotherhood had several reoccurring voices, like Edward, Winry, and Roy Mustang, but it also lost some old voices such as Alphonse and Scar. It took some time to get over Al, but eventually it was fine. With the award-winning cast and some new additions, they improved from the original a lot. The relationship between Ed and Al was implied, so they focused on their relationship between other characters. They also didn't focus on Edward 100% of the time (IMO, Ed was in like every scene in original). Instead, they gave Alphonse a lot of solo missions (and a bigger role), developed a new character named Greed/Lin, developed many other characters and had LESS EMPHASIS on the philosopher stone. Winry and Ed, Xing and Ling, Mai Chang and Al, Roy and Riza had they're moments, if you know what I mean. Hohenheim(Elric) had a MUCH BIGGER role in this than the original which was definitely nice to see. Given six years and a manga to follow, they cut out a lot of fillers and improved from the original. The ending was very satisfying compared to the original even though it was more cliché. 11/10\nEpisodes 0-30 Original was better imo. It was more detailed and darker.\nEpisodes 30-64 Brotherhood no doubt was better. Even though, brotherhood didn't have a great start, it definitely picked it up towards the end. A huge variety of new characters, better character development and a stronger plot to follow.\nCharacters - Original VS Brotherhood\nEd - Brotherhood. Winry and Ed = GG \nAl - Brotherhood. More independent and interesting \nWinry - Brotherhood. In a lot more episodes...too bad they didn't kiss \nScar - Brotherhood. Glad he helped. Didn't like him rebellious. \nGreed/Ling - Brotherhood. He was Badass.\nRoy - Brotherhood. Even more Badass than before. \nRiza - Brotherhood. More involved.\nRoy's Team - Brotherhood. Sad and Happy things happen. \nHohenheim - Brotherhood. HAD IMPORTANCE IN THE STORY. \nFuhrer Bradley - Brotherhood. ACTUALLY FOUGHT\nPinako - Brotherhood.\nShou Tucker - Brotherhood. Glad hes gone. \nYoki(mustache dude) - Brotherhood. He was like Hercule in DBZ \nLust - Original. I missed her. \nEnvy - Original. Didn't really like both characters\nGluttony - Original. Showed more emotion, rather than go maniacal.\nLouis Armstong - Original. He was annoying, but he got owned in FMA:B\nHughes - Original. \nIzumi Curtis - Original. Was a lot darker and sadder. \nMarco - Original. I didn't like him. Should've gotten rid of him in FMA:B. \nRose - Original. She was brown.\nBigger roles were played better in Brotherhood.\nViewers should definitely watch both because they are great. I found brotherhood to be alot better because of its stronger plot, improved and vast character development, and definitive ending. FMA offered a darker, more linear sort of story and brotherhood offered colorful and satisfying story.\nFMA:Brotherhood is an amazing anime, one of the best i've seen.

I found the ending a little bit unclear and disappointing too but it is something i could live with because u can mostly predict the future. The action in the anime is not that much\n          \n        but wisely used and i have apreciated every single episode taking out that one where it makes a sypnosis about all the previous story. The thing i mostly apreciatted in the anime was the character developing , loved to see so many different personalities , sizes and background stories from both sides of the teams , one of my favorite characters has to be \" Greed \" , i think it adds a lot of fun to the anime. The anime is pretty much fun to watch too as it provides a lot of humour between the drama and avoids the episode to become a filler , although in my opinion there wasn't such thing in this anime. The Art would be perfect if it wasn't for that \"Envy\"'s transformation , the graphics get unbalanced and even the timing gets wrong , i have no idea what were they thinking about but it sucked. \n        "},

I highly recommend FMAB over the original mainly due to the plot. As Fullmetal Alchemist the original had a compelling story with details and description it wasn't true to the manga and definitely left major plot holes with an ending without much explanation. However, the movie that goes with the original does give more explanation (Conqueror of Shambala). \nAside from that, Fullmetal Alchemist; Brotherhood gave great details and explanation to the plot line, the concept of alchemy and also how alchemy and Alkahestry is used. The characters all had their very strange and very\n          \n        compelling personalities that somebody could relate to in one way or another (especially since I am a smart hot-head who hates milk).  Another good point that I would recommend FMAB is that the story stays true to the manga over the original as the manga story line is almost identical to the story line of FMAB (with minor differences as all anime-manga have). \nOverall, I recommend Fullmetal Alchemist; Brotherhood for it's greatly detailed plot with amazingly personality characters and explanation for it's mysteries as well as it gives a touching look on brothers who stick together and faithful friends who may constantly get mad at you (Winry). \n        "},

There are two series; the 2003 anime (just called \"Fullmetal Alchemist\") that was made while the manga was still in progress, and divulges from the series after it caught up with the manga. \"Brotherhood\" is a remake and adapts the entire finished manga. I recommend Brotherhood.\nHow good is it? Solid 10/10 (masterpiece)\nWhat is it rated? MA for violence and language. There is no fanservice in this series.\nWhere to watch: Both the 2003 and 'Brotherhood' series are available on Netflix instant watch (except for the\n          \n        final season of Brotherhood, which is on Netflix DVD).\nNotes: FMA:B is a solid anime and one of the best anime series I've ever seen. This is my go-to for getting people into anime. Follows the story of the Elric brothers as they try to get their bodies back after an attempt to resurrect their mother fails horribly. 64 episodes long with absolutely no filler whatsoever. I would recommend you watch the first three episodes of the 2003 version, as it elaborates on the premise of the series, then hop on over to Brotherhood. One of the best dubs out there.\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    Anyone who's familiar with anime has heard of Fullmetal Alchemist. The manga and the two anime based off of it have both become powerhouses in the industry both by themselves and with merchandise: plushies, video games, wall scrolls and so on. When I received a review request for Brotherhood I wasn't sure how to distinguish what I have to say from what's already been said. That's when I was given a helpful suggestion from one of my lovely fans (I just assume that all my fans are lovely people.) A comparison review discussing the differences between FMA and Brotherhood and which is the stronger anime.\n          \n        It's been quite a while since I got the request since I needed time to re-watch both anime, but let's take a look at FMA vs. Brotherhood.\nThe overall story starts out the same: two alchemist brothers attempt to bring their dead mother back to life and one loses an arm and leg the other loses his entire body. The two go on a journey to find the philosopher's stone in the hopes of regaining their bodies. On the way they run into artificially created humans called homonculi who are planning something nasty for the entire country and the brothers have to find out what it is and how it can be stopped. The stories diverge at that point, but I can't really go into too many details without giving spoilers. Which is better? Well, both have some intriguing ideas presented and both are well-paced with good action and character moments. That being said, Brotherhood is better overall. The story holds together a bit better and it doesn't have all the filler that weakens the original. In Brotherhood, everything is relevant. You couldn't take out a few episodes and lose nothing. That being said, I'd like to take a moment to address the endings. Both anime have weak endings. FMA because it's rushed, Brotherhood because it's cliche and pretty stupid. FMA actually has a more satisfying ending as a result. It may be rushed, but at least there was an obvious effort that went into it. Brotherhood's ending is just lazy. \nLet's move on to the characters. This is a bit more difficult so I'm going to split it into four categories: protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters and military characters. Let's start with the protagonists. Edward and Alphonse are pretty close to identical in both anime. They're a bit jaded since they had to grow up too fast, but they've also got a naive idealism about them which creates an interesting dichotomy. Both anime put them in moral dilemmas that build their characters. Really, it's difficult to say that one anime handles them better than the other, but if I had to choose I would say that the original handles them better. The main reason being the underground laboratory scene. I won't go into too much detail but it's a really powerful scene in the original that really pushes Ed into a serious dilemma and forces him to make a difficult choice. In Brotherhood, that choice doesn't exist and the Brothers' decision as a result seems much stronger in the original. Now, let's talk about our antagonists. The Homonculi and their creator. There actually is a pretty substantial difference with them in the two anime. Three Homonculi are completely different, their leader is different and the way they're created is different. Which one is better? It has to be Brotherhood in this case. FMA's homonculi could've been much more interesting, but they never develop them and the logical conflicts that should arise from the way they're created are never fully explored but rather, only briefly touched on. Their leader is also severely under-developed in FMA and comes off as more of a one-dimensional cartoon villain than an interesting character. Brotherhood does a much better job of fleshing the antagonists out as characters and making them interesting. Brotherhood also does a much better job of connecting the attributes that they're named for to their characters. Now, let's move on to supporting characters. Both anime have massive casts and both do a lot with them. Neither of them get the chance to fully develop their supporting casts but both manage to do quite a bit. Which one does better with them? I would have to say it's the original. There are two reasons for that. The first is that Brotherhood has one really annoying character (May) that the original doesn't. The second is that FMA does a bit more to develop the ones it has. Now for the military characters. The reason that this is its own category is simply that there are so many military characters in both anime and they take on various roles. Which one is better? That would be Brotherhood. Again, there are two major reasons. The first being that Brotherhood has some interesting characters that FMA lacks most notably the Briggs soldiers. The second is that Brotherhood does a much better job of showcasing the cleverness of these characters, especially Roy Mustang and his group. The original does a lot less with them and, as a result, they come off as much less interesting. So, which series does better with characters overall? I'd have to say Brotherhood. FMA does slightly better with the protagonists but Brotherhood does much better with the antagonists. FMA does more with the supporting characters, but Brotherhood does more with the military and they're more important to the plot.\nNow, let's talk about the art. This is a difficult one since both anime have nearly identical art styles. But there is one major difference and that's the comedic effects. These are moments where the art style changes temporarily for comedic impact and Brotherhood does it a lot more than FMA. Honestly, I think that they work on occasion but that they detract from the flow of the series when they're over-used. Brotherhood doesn't just over-use them, it downright abuses them. As a consequence, the original really does have a stronger aesthetic sense.\nSome of the actors are the same. Paku Romi, Kugimiya Rie, Utsumi Kenji, Shibata Hidekatsu and several others do really well in both anime. Even the actors who change give roughly equal performances. As a result I'm going to have to base the sound competition on the music. In this case, FMA is superior to Brotherhood. It might have one really stupid and annoying song (Ready Steady Go) but overall it has much more memorable and better done music. This isn't to say that Brotherhood has bad music, it's just pretty forgettable. There are one or two really good songs but they can't really compare to Melissa, Shounen Yo Shinjiru Nakama Yo, or Hagane no Kokoro.\nLet's quickly look at the yuri factor. FMA has more les-yay than Brotherhood. The major reason being that FMA mostly avoids developing het romances and concentrates on developing relationships between the characters some of which read as a bit homo-erotic. Particularly the dynamic between Sheska and Winry. Brotherhood has a few homo-erotic moments, but not to the same extent. I'm giving FMA a yuri factor of 3/10 and Brotherhood a yuri factor of 1.5/10. \nSo, when all is said and done, which anime is stronger? I'm going to have to say Brotherhood. They're both great anime, but Brotherhood has the more cohesive story and superior characters. FMA has better art and music, but those aspects simply aren't as important. My final ratings are an 8/10 for FMA and an 8.5/10 for Brotherhood. You couldn't go wrong with watching either of them but if you're only going to watch one, make it Brotherhood.\n        "},

I’m not saying that shows like Fairy Tail, Dragon Ball Z, and Pokemon don’t have merit - this just happens to go above and beyond in terms of story-telling, emotional impact, characterization, and theme.\nHaving broken the laws of alchemy in a failed attempt to bring their recently deceased mother back to life, two brothers pay a heavy price, a price of flesh. Thus begins their journey for redemption- to become truly powerful alchemists and gain back that which was lost. A journey\n          \n        which will lead them to unexpected places, unexpected truths, and embroil them in conflict much larger then they ever imagined.\nFMA:B has plenty of comic relief, but for the most part doesn’t pull its punches. It deals in life and death, responsibility, sacrifice, power, racism, war, and revenge - all contributing to a classic coming of age story. It’s dark enough thematically to appeal to the more serious viewer, while still being action packed enough to hold the attention of the typical shounen audience.\nWith 64 episodes, there’s plenty of time to give the characters histories and develop them throughout the story- even many of secondary characters and villains. You won’t find “bwahahahaha” cardboard baddies, or characters for the sake of characters here. As in any great piece of story telling, you’ll find things to like and dislike about every character. The people in the show will feel real to you, and you’ll care about the things they go through. Naturally, 64 episodes is also plenty of time for twists and turns, and nail biting suspense.\n*I originally posted this to my Tumblr, because I'm discussing favorite shows with a friend over there.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I honestly wish MAL had a way of doing the ratings so I could do points (like 9.8) than a whole number (like 10) so I could give a more accurate rating.. but. \nbefore my review, I wanted to mention that my review is catered towards those who have watched the original series since every time I think of Brotherhood, I'm constantly linking it back to the original series.  \nanyways. \nI think it's a sin if you have not heard of the FMA franchise and you watch animes. \nThe original FMA series swept the anime world by storm and collected fans like a hook,\n          \n        line and sinker. While its popularity dawdled when the series started breaking away from the manga's storyline, it was still hailed by many reviewers/critics alike as a great, must-watch series.  I was no exception to its hype. \nAfter watching the original FMA, I stayed away from animes for the last three years. Any series I tried after FMA, I couldn't get into it -- it just wasn't good enough. It didn't have that \"it\" factor that FMA had. And so I left each series after FMA unfinished, dropped and with huge disappointments. So I left the anime world all together until I heard the news of a remake of FMA coming out. Initially when I heard about this re-make series, I got nervous at the possibility of them ruining what I hailed as one of the greatest animes at the time. After all, was it possible to perfect an already masterful series? But for the sake of my love for the original series, I decided to give Brotherhood a try. \nAnd what a terrifyingly amazing anime it was... \n...is what I would like to say. but the first impression of FMA: brotherhood was disappointment. I mostly owe this to the extreme fast pacing that FMA: Brotherhood adapted for the first 11 episodes. It starts off at a breakneck speed and crams I believe 2-3 episodes of what the original FMA had into 1.\nThe advantage of this is that it is a nice, FAST refresher for those who have watched the original series and for those who are new, it is a very fast summary of the big events (ie nina) that would continue to resurface throughout the series. The disadvantage (and my problem) of this method is that it loses the emotions behind each scenes (namely Nina's) that the original series so very well poignantly portrayed. However, I do understand that Bones had to cram this long series into a span of a year. Taking that into account, it does get the job done and bring the audiences to the branching point where FMA and brotherhood essentially splits, neatly and cleanly. And from this point onwards, it certainly did become the \"terrifyingly amazing anime\" that I hoped it to be. \nThe plot is undoubtedly one of the most original, action-packed, twisted storylines I have seen. However, what makes this anime so great is that it also had comedic moments that serve as a breather to all the emotional or intense scenes. Most animes I've seen run into a problem here as they are either not able to break away from the heavy atmosphere or the comedic moments are awkwardly placed. Brotherhood proves otherwise and makes the switch into and out of comedic scenes work smoothly. And I praise them for it. Even in the most dire consequences, I can't help but let out a chuckle every time Ed erupts into fits with the word \"short\" The plot is definitely more smoother than FMA was (most likely since it just followed the manga, which had a very complex yet easy to follow storyline) and the ending of Brotherhood is simply divine. I can't put it in words how good and satisfied the ending left me -- it neatly put all the stray hairs into one and gave me what I think is the most appropriate and \"realistic\" end for this series.  \nIf I had one thing to complain about aside from the loss of emotional component in the beginning, it's the episode with Yoki. Honestly, it was so short that it completely passed over my head when he was reintroduced. I thought he was a character that appeared out of nowhere until the anime had a refresher of where the viewers first met him. While he isn't a super important character, he's a character that constantly appears and reappears throughout the series. Thus, I felt that his episode should have been expanded longer than what it was in the beginning. \nI'm not a huge stickler on music/voice in general -- but the voice actors did a great job with each of their assigned characters. I can't imagine them sounding like any other after the completion of the series. And the soundtracks, while I do prefer the FMA ones, Brotherhood still provides great OSTs that left me with no complaints.  \nFrom what I remember, while it was more simple, the animation was more crisper than what I had seen in the FMA. however, I did originally hate the art -- not because it was bad but it took me a couple episodes to get used to it. After all, I loved FMA through and through that I've rewatched the series on more than one occassion. It was natural that the image of Ed, Al and all the other characters were so deeply embedded in my head that my brain registered any other form of them as \"weird\" and \"awkward\" but after getting used to it, I really liked it. I remember really enjoying the fight scenes in FMA brotherhood, lots of great visual affects, pleasing to the eye. (especially during transmutation) fantastic.  \nIf I had to point to the single most thing that probably made Brotherhood a bigger gem than FMA it is probably in the characters. FMA, I think, focuses heavily on the two brothers and their development throughout the story. Brotherhood doesn't stray from this but also adds in the other characters and enhances their role in the story -- adding depth and complexity to the side characters more than FMA did such as with Mustang and most definitely the antagonists. (I find this ironic since Brotherhood is well, called \"brother\"hood but does a better job in developing the entire cast) By the end of the story, it is able to boast a gigantic number of characters but is able to package them individually into well-rounded characters. \nso the short version/my breakdown: \nplot (9.8/10) fast fast pacing in the beginning, you get used to it as it goes. however, as a compensation, lacks a bit in emotions in the beginning. well balanced series of comedy/serious moments, nice twists and an EPIC, godly ending. \nmusic (10/10) \nanimation (10/10) took awhile to get used to. a bit more simpler than FMA but more crisp. great visual effects that stands out in the fight scenes. \ncharacter (10/10) a crazy huge cast. however, they're all well-developed and fit into the story rather nicely. \nenjoyment (10++++/10) .. if i could give 11s, this would be it.\noverall (10/10) I'm hesitant to give 10s in any form -- but I think this anime truly deserves it. (or if not, it would be like a 9.99999999) It exceeded what I thought was impossible and delivered a captivating story with detailed character development, great music/visual to boot and NO FILLERS (the last one being a pretty amazing feat in this day and age if you know what I mean). A classic in my book, and a must-watch in everyone's. \n*random note: I'm not sure how helpful this would be since most people who read this review had probably finished the series, BUT for those who are starting and have watched and loved the original series, I would actually recommend skipping the first 11 (assuming you're well familiar with the story) since I think it's around episode 11-12 where the branching from FMA and Brotherhood starts. I did that when I watched Brotherhood first time around because I've watched FMA enough times (I'm too embarrassed to tell you the exact number) that I just continued comparing the two series and also got bored since I knew the scenes by heart. \n        "},

The reasons that I say that are as below:\nStory:\nFor someone who watched the 2003 version,I would say that nothing could beat the storyline of the 2003 version but I was dead wrong. This version follows the manga which in my opinion is what most anime should be like. I am not saying that all adaptions from manga must strictly follow all the details in the manga but this version of Fullmetal Alchemist is exactly how you would imagined it to be like when you read the manga or even better. It is a perfect story coming\n          \n        to life and it will blow you away. It goes by phases which built up the suspense and takes your breathe away each time due to the scale and magnitude of the events. As the story progresses, you will be filled with more questions and you will keep thinking that it couldn't get better but it will,I assure you and that's the main attraction factor, the plot that draws you in,with you wanting to know more and more. The plot twists are placed so well that it's not even plot twists anymore,it's like flowing water which just integrates into your mind and at the end of the story, all your questions are answered, with you taking a different look at life. \nArt:\nWell,I am no artist and I am not very picky about graphics but I can definitely say that the graphics for this anime is really nice. The flashes and booms are very detailed and yet,it gives you a simple feeling and gets the point across very easily,unlike those complicated graphics and animations that gives you the feeling of what the hell just happened.\nSound:\nFrom explosions to water dripping to even bird chirping,it is really quite detailed.  The music really fits the scenes and added an extra layer of enjoyment to the anime. The opening song is also very good,especially opening 4 which is 'Period' by Chemistry.\nCharacter:\nThe development of the characters are very through and they come together perfectly just like jigsaw pieces,giving a great sense of enjoyment. The feelings of the characters are reflected so well that it's no longer just an anime,you will feel that it's real life and in a real situation.\nEnjoyment & Overall:\nI put these two together as my answer to both of them are the same. I enjoyed the series a lot and the reasons are what I have stated above and overall,this anime truly deserves credit as it integrates into the mind so well and viewers are sucked into their world and it appeals to all the senses except taste of course. Last but not least,it made me understand the different aspects of life and the true value of life which I think is very meaningful and is done in a very subtle way but yet,it etches in my mind. I hope for those who hasn't watched this anime,after looking at my review,you would go watch it and experience true perfection as I have experienced.\n        "},

The story starts off quickly and every episode is easy to understand and, at the same time, is very interesting. Many episodes ends with cliffhangers making you want to watch more!\nPlot: \nThe plot of the anime was given a 10/10 because the ideas presented in this anime was very interesting. Every new problem the Elric Brothers encounter contributes to the main issue and in the end, everything adds up! Every episode of this anime is addicting (even the beginning) and it will keep making you want\n          \n        to watch more! The main plot in the story was also very good and another reason to enjoy the anime!\nArt:\nI was very fascinated with the art in this anime. The animations of the battle scenes and transmutations were over the top. Unlike the original FMA, FMA brotherhood had unique animation (especially during the transmutations) that made the anime a lot more fun to watch! The opening and ending animations were also very amazing. Those animations made me want to keep watching because it previewed amazing battle scenes, without giving any spoilers.\nSound (OSTs, OP and END, Seiyuus, sound Effects, Etc):\nThere are many OST soundtrack and songs in FMA brotherhood and each of them were played at perfect moments! This helped build suspense and made the animation a LOT more exciting! I loved almost all of the opening and ending songs and the lyrics followed along with the plot so well! I also thought the voice actors matched each character's voice very well and made each character unique. Many of the sound effects used in battles made it a lot more exciting to watch.\nCharacter:\nI loved all the characters in FMA (including the antagonists)! Each character played a special role that contributed to the story and I had something to like about every character! In FMA brotherhood, there isn't a character that makes you like \"Man! I hate this character so much!\" Instead it made me think \"I wonder why he/she is doing this.\" Sure, there are some characters I liked more than others, but all the characters played a great and interesting role and the anime wouldn't be as good if anyone of the characters were not in this anime.\nEnjoyment:\nThis was my #1 most enjoyed anime because this anime has the ability to make you have 20 different emotions in a matter of 20-25 minutes. One episode your maybe crying and 10 minutes later on the same episode, you maybe crazily laughing! This anime had me hooked all the way through watching it. The anime had action, humor, drama, mystery, and even some romance (Royai). Though there was only a little bit of romance, it had me happily squealing over how great of a couple they were!

SOME PART MAY SPOIL PEOPLE WHO NEVER WATCHED)\nStory: 6\n I can't say much about the story since the series only started by 4 episodes and more are needed for better explaination. However, judging from this four episodes the Famous Full Metal Alchemist (Although Season 1 ending was dissapointed) has come back with a bang, throwing people off guard. Our (ahem) Small, brave, smart and arrogant Edward Elric is back with his awesome alchemy with his (ahem) Big, just and kind Brother Alphonse Elric. The\n          \n        story does start good, but when the rerun of some similar episodes from the First season happened the interest in watching may fall down a lot. If the story still continues on like this 6 is the maximun I can give.\nArt: 10\n Like the First Season, Season two doesn't dissapoint us with any crappy drawing at all. Instead, the drawing looks more better and more realistic (although some parts still not).\nSound: 10\n The opening and the ending of FMA never cease to amaze the viewers. Their OP and ED does go along with the story and become the starter/dessert before the story starts/end. The effects (e.g. Ice cracking, footstep, blast attack, slashing) were all input and thus pull us into the story.\nCharacter: 6\n Like Story I can't evaluate the character yet with only 4 episodes watched. Overall from FMA 1 is a 10, but there's chance that the second season will be worse than the first. Only time will tells. (For anyone who still interest in reading the character now read FMA 1 review)\nEnjoyment: 9\n Alchemy, is to change the elements of the substance from one form to another and from that form may also turned into another. This idea is already much to sastified the viewers with their used of Alchemy (e.g.: Change Water to Ice then boil ice or melt ice and chance it back to water) Another thing that will make people enjoy is their plot, which can twist and turn like a vine. However, the plot will still have to looks throughout the second season.\nOverall: 7\n A good starting, If FMA 2 can power up it's story the character will goes up by itself. If they can really suceed in making an awesome story for episodes and finish with an epic ending then this serie should deserve a 10. If...\n        "},

I considered this show, a normal one. Like every other shonens, it just couldn´t be better. It has a litle bit of everything, wich is nice. But for those (like me) who are lokking for more specific genders (like drama, or action) it won´t be found on this show. \n\nI think that it has nothing special besides the  great history behind it (i loved the history) but the rest is just meh, not enough for\n          \n        the overall rate of 9.24/10 . \nThe character development is weak as everything. They don´t go deep into any character. They explore some of them but not deep enough.  \nThe main character, Edward Elric is really the main character? Because for a shonen, having the best action parts not envolving the main character, is strange for me. Let's face it, the best fights he doesn´t even appears. \n\nThe plot is nice, but it is not big enough for 64 episodes .. in the middle of the anime i was bored and watching for get to the end. I reached the end, and it's nothing more than a normal end. The weak good guy defeats the strong bad guy cause he has friends .. tipical of a shonen. \n\nOverall, this anime may be good for those who are starting to getting deep in the anime world, or for young groups. But for those who are looking for a more detailed anime about certain gender(such as drama / action / romance  ) i don´t advise you to watch this one.  \nThe plot saved this anime, that's why i gave it a 7/10. \nSorry for the crappy english at some parts ;P \n        "},

It will always will be my favorite anime period. This anime lived up to its massive potential and seriously in my opinion its way more than a 10/10.. It broke the charts in my heart. It was and always will be an original masterpiece, as it going to be difficult wait nearly impossible to top right now. Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood had it all, the climax, plot, theme everything plus more. THE STORY\n          \n        was truly one of a kind and unpredictable as it prob put everyone including me on the edge of our seats.You couldn't even tell what was going to happen most of the time. The characters was well executed in their own unique way and they were effectively used to their potential. From Episode 1 it was already all out and stayed like that until episode 64 plus there was no waste of episodes as the story was always hyping whats ahead to their maximum ability. . The emotions that filled out in this anime was incredible. At first glance I honestly thought it was just all hype but it proved me wrong by a mega landslide. The characters especially the main protagonist Edward Elric who is now my favourite had determination, drive, and pure passion to overcome just about anything got me all pumped up. If this is anime taught me something it's pretty much everything that I lacked. I can finally wake up properly and say to myself \"Damn, if a anime character like that has all of those traits to keep on living no matter how intense the pain is, then why am i here complaining at my life or why dont i have any wifi? Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood isn't one of the top best Animes of the Century just because of the sound, story, enjoyment, art, and characters , as in my opinion it gave us a reason to not give up. Its probably saying to much just because its not even real and an anime right? The bigger picture is that IT SHOWED US WHAT IS LIKE to lose a friend, comrade, lover, a body part, and how they fought through it. It felt that it is a real story and that we can't just give in now. That is how much IMPACT this anime has given to me, and it even made me shed a tear in the finale. To fight all of that and still show the drive and determination just surprised me. I learned a lot like legit and ill always give my all until the day i die. This is just my heavy opinion and i hope you guys can respect that.\nI HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE, even if you don't watch anime JUST WATCH THIS AND ULL BE LOVING WHAT ANIME IS ALL ABOUT. I watched the original one first to hype me up for brotherhood and so i can understand it more clear but you don't have to watch it as heading into Brotherhood is also fine. I'd like thank everyone in advance in taking the time to read this, I really have the urge to write way more but i cant put some of my feelings to Full Metal into words and plus it might be a pain.Sorry if i poured  my heart out too much but really it was and is always going to be that damn good. LOL That Is Folks! Finally Thanks Yasuhiro Irie for directing, Hiroo Maruyama, Noritomo Yonai, Ryo Oyama, Nobuyuki Kurashige for producing and pretty much everyone who participated in making this! OH AND THE MUSIC IS AMAZING TOO DOWNLOAD IT PEEPS, Peace Out"},

A plot that makes a ton of sense, and the first piece of fictional writing that actually has some thought into what \"God\" actually is.\nThe character development literally is one of the best parts of this anime. Edward stars as a little boy in the first few episodes and by the end turns into a ripped young man, who even Winry notices when she talks about how broad his shoulders have gotten.\nThe animation is great, the back stories, the soundtrack, the 7\n          \n        deadly sins being put into antagonist with feelings themselves was remarkable. \nLike a lot of anime, its usually a point where you think the bad guy has figured out his master plan, but you know the good guys will come up with a plan to triumph in the end. \nHowever there is a time, even if its brief where you actually think the antagonist has won, and you feel bad watching, something different for a change.\nI did think the middle episodes up in Mt Briggs were a BIT of a drag, but for the most part, each episode had plenty of information that was useful and meaningful, especially if you watch it twice.\nSoundtrack is flawless between the high's and low's to the action. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I'll make it very simple. It's a great show, but it has a few flaws, which really sometimes can't be helped. Heads up, this is my first review, but I'm 99.999% sure it has no spoilers. \nStory - 9. This show was based off of the manga, and the story has a couple flaws, due to it adding another way of life, alchemy. With doing so, it left a few holes unanswered and sometimes contradicted itself, but thats typical. This show doesn't leave too much unanswered, though.\nArt - 10. It's a great mix of highly detailed and simplistic.\nSound - 9. I did feel in some\n          \n        episodes that a certain song from its OST didn't fit well with the moment, especially since other songs in the same OST could have done the job better. But then again, it was only in rare occasions, which is why it's a 9 and not an 8.\nCharacters - 10. If there was an 11, it would have gotten that no problem. The characters are all round characters, and the show, in it's amazing way, makes you feel like you know them, and makes you feel sorry when they undergo a tragedy, and eccentric for them when they feel happy.\nEnjoyment - 10. It is hard not to binge watch this series. Not just because of the crazy amount of cliff hangers, but also because you can't get enough of the amazingness it brings.  (Amazingness is not a word. Please do not use it in proper writing). \nOverall - 10. Most of the reasons that I took points off were such minuscule and tiny things that if you are just watching it from an anime fan's point of view, you wouldn't even notice. As someone who has thought himself to notice small things, I couldn't help myself. That being said, this anime deserves to be where it is currently ranking: 2nd place. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This review is mainly meant for anyone who watched Fullmetal Alchemist and is either considering Brotherhood, has watched a few episodes and not liked it, or has read one of the negative reviews and was put off.\nWhen I first heard about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I was skeptical. Seeing as the original Fullmetal Alchemist is the first anime I have ever completely watched and is the spark that ignited my obsessive love of anime that I have today, a redo seemed unnecessary to say the least. What could possibly be improved upon a show as fantastic as Fullmetal Alchemist? \nWith hesitation and doubt in my heart\n          \n        I started watching the series... and instantly hated it. I won't lie, my first impressions were not only that the show didn't live up to the original, but that it was also an abomination that was dancing on the grave of a greater show. \nI cried, I screamed, I broke things, I didn't do any of the above because I'm exaggerating and not actually crazy, but I was still quite upset. The criticisms bubbled up inside me until I was frustratingly glaring at the TV appalled at such changes as Alphonse's voice actor, or a lack of the opening starting with the classic \"in those days, we really believed...\" lines from Al. \nWith each passing episode the insults to Fullmetal Alchemist seemed to grow, episodes that were lovingly crafted in the original series were apparently being lightly brushed on. Moments in the original that got me hooked fell flat in Brotherhood, and I was fed up and ready to write the letter of complaint to end all letters of complaint. But then, my eyes began to open. \nRight around episode 13 where the plot of the two animes separates I started to think that this story might actually be good. As the episodes began to fly I realized that it wasn't good, it was great. After finishing the series I knew without a doubt in my mind that what I had witnessed was my favorite anime of all time. The story of Brotherhood is better than that of the original on so many levels that the two shows truly don't compare. After having my eyes opened I was forced to drop the rating that I gave to the original to an 8 simply because now I knew how much lost potential it had. \nIf you enjoyed the story of Fullmetal Alchemist, stick with Brotherhood and I guarantee you that you will not regret it. Not only is the plot and storyline vastly improved upon and more satisfying, the animation, music (in my opinion at least, some disagree), characters, and overall feel is far better. \nTherefore, if you are a true fan of the original series don't give up on Brotherhood after only a few episodes like I was so tempted to do, it is a show that grows into something that will go down in history as one of the greats of animation history and you shouldn't miss out.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Full Metal Alchemist holds a very special place in my heart, as it has been one of my favourites for over 10 years now. Hiromu Arakawa is without a doubt one of the most talented, inspirational artists in the manga field; her story telling abilities are just as amazing as her drawing skills. It was an absolute joy seeing such a compelling manga series get not one, but TWO anime adaptations. The original FMA series released in 2003 was brilliant, but then Brotherhood came along and made everything ten times better.\nBrotherhood is much more faithful to the manga story line; it introduces a bunch of\n          \n        new characters, such as May Chang, Ling Yao and his two bodyguards who never made it into the first series. There are also no filler episodes, which can get on my nerves with any popular, long running franchises. The pacing is far quicker compared to the 2003 series - certain events that took up two or three episodes in the first adaptation are now condensed into a single episode. The main plot is so epic anyway that there quite simply isn't room for any side stories. It will have you hooked from the beginning - the more you get into it, the harder it will be to stop watching because you get the urge to find out what happens next. \nThe animation is among the best I've ever seen in an anime series - the character designs have improved significantly since 2003 and the settings are absolutely gorgeous, especially Fort Briggs which is surrounded by snow capped mountains. The numerous alchemy sequences are captured amazingly well, from the metallic chime that sounds when Edward claps his hands to the lightning effects that occur when the alchemy is being performed. \nAll of the opening and ending themes are a delight to watch and listen to; most of them are really catchy after a few listens! The various instrumental pieces scattered throughout the episodes succeed in creating the perfect mood for specific scenes, whether they're action packed, suspenseful or tugging on the heart strings.\nI admit that I've not seen very much of the Japanese audio with subtitles. It's not that I don't think it's good, it's just that the English dub is so good that I forget to give the Japanese a chance! Nearly every member of the original FMA cast reprised their roles in the English dub, and boy do they deliver! They really did a fantastic job of bringing the characters to life; I couldn't fault any of the performances.\nOne thing that I admire about Hiromu Arakawa is that she has a great ability to create lovable, genuinely interesting characters that all have a purpose in the series - none of them are thrown in just for the sake of it. They'll stay with you long after you've finished the story - especially the Elric brothers as their unbreakable bond had a very profound effect on me.\nTo summarise, Brotherhood is an absolute gem of a series that ticks all the right boxes - it's got plenty of action, thought provoking topics and heart breaking moments. An instant classic that surely belongs in every anime fan's collection. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an anime that came out in 2009. It was released 6 years after the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime. Unlike that one however, it follows the manga completely. This is the highest rated show on MAL and considered the best anime of all time by many. I disagree however and find the show highly overrated, especially compared to its older 2003 brother. But why is that?\nAlso, SPOILER ALERT.\n----------------------STORY----------------------------- (7/10)\nFullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood ( I will refer it as FMA:B from now on) tells the story of the Elric Brothers. The Elrics were abandoned by their father when they were kids and soon after, their\n          \n        mother died. The brothers tried following in their father's footsteps and become alchemists, in order to try human transmutation, a taboo among alchemists which should, theoretically, allow them to bring their dead mother back to life. This goes horribly wrong however, with a rebound occuring. Edward lost his left leg and Alphonse lost his entire body. After Edward had a brief meeting with \"God\", he quickly gave his right arm too in order to bring Alphonse back. Now, the Elric brothers are in a quest to find the Philosopher stone, which will allow them to get their bodies back by immensly amplifying their alchemic abilities. Sounds neat right? Well, no. While the backstory is great, the Plot REALLY, REALLY, REALLY suffers until about episode 12. After that, it is pretty mediocre untill episode 40. After that, it is amazing, hence the rating of \"7\".  The opening arcs are rushed and are quite frankly, boring. I would advise no one watches the first 12 episodes of this series and just watches the first 28 of the 2003 series, which cover the same stuff, but much better. However, be warned. There are differences in the 2003 anime that definetely didn't happen in FMA:B, like the way homoculi are born, and the killer of Winry's parents (Roy in 2003, Scar in 2009). There is also a very good ending here, with Ed making a genius move. There also some very, very minor plot holes and stupid decisions made by some characters (damn, Ed is the equivelant of Shirou Emiya in this show), they are not too annoying.\n-------------------------Art (8)---------------------------------------------\nThis is a great looking series. It is no Fate series, BUT, it is very good looking. The highlight, is of course, the action sequences. Especially the final fight. They are done amazingly well. Just, go watch some samples.\n---------------------------Sound(9)-----------------------------------------------------\nArguably, the show's biggest strength. It has amazing voice acting (especially the English dub), great soundtrack and nice sound effects. \n\n-----------------------Characters(9)-------------------------------------------\nIf not the sound, then the characters are what carry this show. Despite showing 0 character devlopment in the 12 first episodes, it all changes at around episode 22. The best character of all, in my opinion, is \"Greeling\". Now, this does NOT include the villain. The villain is a big \"meh\", because his plan is just bad. neither does it include the homonculi, because they are basically nothing compared to 2003. On their own, they serve as good antagonists to fight, but they show no character, other than the way they all die.\n---------------------------Enjoyment(6)----------------------------------------------\nHey, how can I give it only a 6 when I praised the rest? Well, hold on. The first 12 episodes made me absolutely HATE the show. It was also quite a mess untill episode 40. After that, it got a lot better, but not enough to bring the enjoyment to anything higher than a \"6\".  Also, I didn't enjoy it as much because of the hype surrounding this show. I was really let down, although having key parts of the show spoiled for me, didn't help either. Also, I am saying this right now. The comedy in this series, is AWFUL. \n FMA:B Pros\n+ Backstory with \"God\" can keep you hooked on the plot\n+ Great action scenes\n+ The rich atmosphere and world it creates. Didn't nail it as good as 2003, but I would still love to visit Amestris\n+ The characters \n+ The ending\n+ The sound\n+1st and 4th opening songs are great\n+ It has some really great moments, my favorite being when Edward healed himself in episode 42.\nFMA:B cons\n- First episode is a filler. Now, this may not be a problem for some of you,but if you are anything like me (get done with the story and move on), then this is a problem. \n- Opening arcs are terrible\n- Minor plot holes \n- Awful comedy\n- 2nd, 3rd and 5th openings range from bad to mediocre.\n-  Lighter tone compared to 2003. This may not bother you, but I felt that a darker, more serious tone suited the fullmetal alchemist universe better.\nOverall, this is, in my opinion, an overrated series. It is good, but overrated. FMA:B is one of those animes where the good, are really good but the bad are really bad. "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    As I finish my unhealthy breakfast of leftover Taco Bell and ramen, let me tell you about a legacy called FullMetal Alchemist.\nFullMetal Alchemist {FMA for short} is a franchise that follows two young brothers in an alternate European universe, shortly after industrialization, in which Alchemy is a common practice, and was weaponized for a country at war. There are some rules to alchemy; you can’t create something out of nothing, in order to create, something of equal value must be lost, and human transmutation is strictly forbidden. The aforementioned brothers lose their mother to sickness sometime after their father had left. Grief-stricken, the brothers Edward\n          \n        and Alphonse attempt to re-create their mother’s body and bring her soul back from the dead. The cost? Literally and arm and a leg, plus Al’s entire body. And thus begins the story of FullMetal Alchemist...\nThe franchise started out as a manga, then spawned an Anime simply called FullMetal Alchemist, which only loosely followed the manga. With a movie, two games, some light novels and drama CDs in between, a second re-adaption of the story titled FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was created, following the manga almost verbatim.\nStory: 10/10\nThe plot, to this day, is still very original. It’s not every day you hear about brothers wanting to get their bodies back, Alchemy also isn’t a very widespread theme in anime. The author obviously went to great lengths to do her research on the subjects of the anime, and utilized her vast imagination to create supernatural themes and plot twists. The story is very well written, very thought out, and portrayed very well. It progresses nicely throughout the anime, with next to no fillers.\nWith an episode count of 64, it would seem that the anime elongates the story, but not so. The concepts of FullMetal Alchemist could be a little difficult to understand without the proper explanations. No, I’m not saying there’s episodes full of lecture, I’m saying that most of the explanations are portrayed by example an realizations. That is a HUGE plus for me. I don’t think there’s anything more irritating than the characters explaining the obvious, or voicing what they’re figuring out all the time, as if the audience is stupid. The only minor gripe I have is that it pulls a bit of a Dragon Ball Z towards the end. And by that I mean, fights take episodes to conclude. It’s very minor, though, and understandable as the battles become more difficult and the length of them is nowhere near comparable to DBZ or even Naruto, so I hope it wouldn’t be an issue enough to cause someone to not finish this great anime.\nAnimation: 10/10\nFMA is animated beautifully. There are differences in the facial features of the characters. Child characters look young in the face as well. One of my favorite animation features is that as the characters developed, you could see it in their physical stature. Also, the artist is good at portraying emotions in the eyes, which couldn’t be more useful in this emotionally charged anime. The backgrounds were drawn and painted beautifully, they almost looked 3D. What really perfected this score is the all the opening and ending credits being animated so beautifully and creatively. All with a cherry on top.\nSound: 9/10\nAll of the opening and ending songs were pretty unique and captured the tone of the manga during specific seasons perfectly. The music was composed nicely, and went with the current emotions of the anime at the perfect times. However, the same segments of the same songs were used over and over and over again, and it got a little annoying after a while.\nCharacters: 10/10\nEach and every character is unique, with their own little trademarks. The characters meshed well together, even the antagonists. If the characters weren’t how they are, then I don’t think FMA would be half as good as it is. Plot progressed because of character’s motives and resolve, they weren’t just pawns to utilize to get an idea across. They were far from dry, and I found myself getting attached to each and every one of them. If you’ve read any of my reviews before, then you should know that I’m quite fond of character development, and that’s quite abundant in this anime. And as I’ve stated previously; changes in the character’s physical appearance correlated with the change in the character’s character.\nOverall: 9.8/10\nBut why not a perfect 10, Melodux? It’s such a good anime! It is, but if you had read my review up to this point, then you would know that it’s not a perfect anime. I am fully aware that some people are much more critical of anime than I, and would get QUITE annoyed with the minor gripes I had made, and stop watching it. What makes it a good anime? Its originality and the way everything is tied together so well. Story and characters work in harmony, the animation make the portrayal of the story easy on the eyes, and the music adds finishing touches to make it all complete.\nMelodux’s Musings – Why you should watch this version as well as the original: First off, I count the first animated edition of FullMetal Alchemist the “original,” because it came out before Brotherhood. Brotherhood was a good idea to keep the franchise going, and if you’re looking to skip out on reading the lengthy manga, watching Brotherhood is a good way to do it. I bet you’re thinking “OK, so if I watch this, then I have the gist of everything, right? Why would I want to watch the original?” or “I’ve watched Brotherhood, and it’s amazing, nothing will compare, I won’t even look at the original!” BOTH STORIES ARE EQUALLY AS GOOD: the original follows the manga until about the middle of the story and is an equally interesting re-telling of the story. Consider it an “alternate ending” of sorts. If you like the characters and themes in Brotherhood, then the original will be just as good. Conversely, if you enjoyed the characters and themes in the original, then prepare for a more detailed, enhanced animated version of the story while watching Brotherhood.\n        "},

The series has the most unpredictable storyline to it with so many plots and turns incorporating action, mystery, humor, romance,... Once you think the bad guy is about to be eliminated, another even bigger one shows up. I don't even know if there is a single character including the antagonists that I dislike. Every character had their own back story buying sympathy from the audience. Even with so many magical components in the story, the story is still believable since the plot is not unraveled immediately,\n          \n        but with each ongoing second that adds another clue that soon builds up to the climax. The ending definitely leaves the audience with that depressed feeling of \"what to do next\" after watching an amazing story.

They try to do a human transmutation, but in doing so Alphonse lost his body and Edward lost his left leg. In a last minute effort to get his brother back Edward bounds Alphonse's body to a suit of armor and that cost him his right arm. His limbs were replaced with automail and later became a state alchemist. Now this adaptation is more of a direct\n          \n        adaptation to the manga and it excels against it's predecessor. This story is very heavy when it comes to what the characters are feeling. For example there is a death in this show that is still one of the saddest deaths in anime and you see just how his death effects the people around him. And when Roy Mustangs finds the people responsible for his friends death he goes fucking berserk on them. The boys eventually find the ingredients to create a philosopher stone only to find out that the secret ingredient is a immense amount of human sacrifices.\nThe voice acting in FMA: Brotherhood perfect. Vic Mignogna is outstanding as Edward Elric and Travis Willingham as Roy Mustang is superb.\nThe Characters in FMA: Brotherhood are all phenomenal characters. Edward and Alphonse have one of the best sibling relationships in any T.V. show that I've ever seen. Roy Mustang is also a very, very good character because he is a BADASS! There is also Fuhrer Bradley who is honestly a character that takes a complete 180 throughout the course of this anime.\nOverall Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a masterpiece truly a work of art. It has everything from comedy, action, drama, character development, and story. Everything about this anime was great there were few if any problems with this anime and that is why a gave this show a 10/10.\n        "},

Both are really great, and consist of two different ending. Brotherhood is based on the events that were included in the manga, and in my opinion the more superior series. \nIt took me a while to watch the series. I kept on contemplating whether to watch it and when, and then i finally decided to watch it last summer. It started off really good and captured my attention right off the bat. It was a gripping tale of two brothers trying to get the bodies back, brotherhood and family. \nThe main\n          \n        charcters; Ed and Alphonse are just very lovable and you can't help but root for them on their journey. Other characters like Roy Mustang, Hughs and Armstrong all come together to make an awesome support cast. The series also has alot of STRONG female characters which is something I love to see in an anime. They were tough and stood their ground and were not overshadowed by the males.\nBrotherhood is my upmost favourite anime series I've seen. Since watching it last summer, I have watched it an additional 2 times, purely at the fact that I love everything about the series. \nThe comedic elements that they have, to the touching issues about race, war and other moral issues that come into play. The show will take you on an unexpected jouney of laughter and tears and ultimately joy.  "},

It sticks with the manga all the way through unlike the original anime. I wish people would watch this instead of the original FMA anime. They always say Brotherhood is a continuation of the original and it's just really annoying. Seriously, Brotherhood needs more credit. The plot is 100% original.

Also, as a bonus, you can see the characters (Ed in particular) age as the story continues.\nSound: 9\nIt gets the job done, and highlights the points of light-heartedness and of drama.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    So my initial expectations for this anime were pretty low because of the first \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" series. I dropped it because it did not seem to be going anywhere and i honestly did not find it very entertaining. FMA Brotherhood however completely changed my views on this series.\nArt 9/10\nI personally did not prefer the art style for the characters in this anime, but the animation/backgrounds and everything else were very good. It was nothing too over the top but the art was still better than the first FMA's so its all good.\nStory 10/10\nI dropped the first FMA at around episode 20 because it did not\n          \n        seem like the story was getting anywhere. There were several episodes that felt like fillers and could have been removed without seriously harming the series. FMA Brotherhood removed those episodes and therefore was able to add more content (although it did feel a bit rushed at times). The whole story was still told in a way that had me hooked and wanting more. Surprising twists occurred in almost every episode, and everything was neatly explained by the time the series ended. I rarely feel sad to see a series end when theirs still 14 episodes left but i did for this series. Everything was built up so well that i know that the series would end with a bang, but there will be no more after that.\nSound 10/10\nI had not really paid that much attention to the OST in FMA Brotherhood. That is not to say it was bad though, i know they were really good. The openings stuck out too me more though. All 5 of them were amazing. The last one especially stuck out to me because the sad tone to the music and everything going on made it apparent to me that i was nearing the end of this amazing series. It almost brings a tear to my eye every time i listen to it.\nCharacter 10/10:\nThe character development in this show was superb. The two main characters, Ed and Al, had distinctive personalities that they stuck with and made them very likable. All of the other characters, even if they only had minor roles, were very likable as well. Most of them were able to change after meeting Ed and Al, and it was enjoyable to see them learn and grow as the series progressed.\nEnjoyment 10/10\nYou really can't hate on this anime. It has everything from action to comedy and even a tad bit of romance here and there. The story gets told fluently and there is little to no filler episodes. Most all the characters get their past shown or explained so we can understand them more and grow to like them. To top all this off, the animation and music were awesome as well. If you have not checked this anime out yet then you defiantly need to ASAP.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Fullmetal Alchemist and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood differ in story, character, and art style. Comparing one to the other is hard and time consuming. So to put in simple terms FMA, the anime made before FMAB was as good as its successor but not better. FMA's plot  changes halfway into the anime. The point is that FMA had a darker view on the characters and their actions, and had a more serious tone to the situation the character was in. FMAB conentrated on the manga's story line, character development, and had a more comical and light view on situations in the anime. FMAB caught my\n          \n        attention in episode 26 where we get to look at Hoenheim's past or, so called past dream; but the point is is that FMAB had a better formula and caught the attention of many fans and viewers. The other other important detail of why FMAB is better than FMA is the ending; more people seem to enjoy the happier and joyful moments than Edward being sent to another dimension all of his life but no biggie. All I'm trying to say in retrospect is that both are fantastic but one must be chosen to be better than the other, but everyone has their own opinion. \n        "},

While this draws some attention away from the main plot, it allows for extra character development and keeps the story from becoming too overwhelmingly dark.\nIf you didn't like the original Fullmetal Alchemist, you will like this version.

The murder of Nina as a chimera challenged the beliefs of the Elrics' as they witnessed, through their eyes, the destruction of a little girl. These emotional scenes constantly challenge the ideals that the boys possess. These scenes are done extremely well in the anime because the viewer is able to see conflicting views and truly share the heartache of the characters.\nBrotherhood may feel slightly rushed\n          \n        at the start compared to the 2003 series, but i don't believe it misses out any important points, it just increases the pace of the series. Every episode has its own importance and plot progression which means that there is never a feeling of bore or plot diversion. \nThe characters are well developed and there are interesting links between certain characters. Ling and May are both competitors and comrades, reaching for the same goal for the same reason. The characters that are introduced in the series have very interesting and varying backgrounds from; a foreign prince to a dwarf in a flask. The way the characters change through the series adds to the overall quality, an example could include Greed, who showed little compassion and trust in his comrades at the start but thanked them for their companionship ,seconds before his demise.\nThe aesthetics are top-notch and everything flows very well, with the action scenes being a highlight of the series. The OST used in the series is decent but i don't believe it reaches the same heights as the 2003 series. \nOverall, i believe that Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an extremely enjoyable series that boasts an intriguing set of characters with a gripping plot. I highly recommend the series to all, due to its action, romance and plot twists.\n        "},

Al and ed are searching for the Philosophers Stone that is said to amplify the powers of an alchemist enormously. The reason for this is because back in the past they performed a taboo for alchemist , human transmutian. They did this\n          \n        in order to try to review their dead mother, but failed and payed the ultimate price.... Al lost his body and Ed lost a arm and a leg. After this accident they both decided to go on a journy ..to look for the Philosophers Stone in order to get their bodys back.\nA pretty fair story in my opinion.\n_Art_\nNot much have changed with  the art , only been slightly improved in my eyes , the colours are better and they have fixed many poor objects that i've seen in the old series. Something that is just great , so it was nice to see they kept the same art style as they did use in the old serie. Same but slightly improved.\n_Sound_ \nSound is fairly ok , OP and EDS are just amazing to watch , it dosent really happen often i watch the OP and eds in an anime... unless its really good! \nEither than that sounds in the episodes and such are ok , its more up to date i'll say , since the old serie was abit old , so it explains why the sound wasent that great compared to this new serie .\n_Character_\nCharacters have improved abit i'd say, Ed is still the one that is getting pumped when u mention the word midg.... etc :p so each time the word ''tiny'' etc comes in his cool is been swiped of the screen and explodes with a anger that is just funny.\nAl is still the calmest of the elric brothers , something i like very good. dont really know what else i should write about him , he's calm :) thats all i got really.\nSame goes for the rest of the FMA characters , all of them is very similar to the old series , with a few changes of course , they have might been given a small amount of more humor etc . Some are more serious. And also there are slighty more new characters here. The serious and calm ninja from Xing Ling Yao, and his bodyguards , their all great :)\n_Enjoyment_\nThe series are the top of my list at this point , just a wonderfull serie with a good amount of action and humor... its something im looking forward to each week. therefor its getting top score , i cant get enough of it.\n_Overall_ \nOverall this is a serie i would like to recommend all fans of FMA to watch , ofc its a must to see this if you did watch the original serie! but also for people that isent familiar with this one , please take ur time to check it out :) In my opinion this is one of the best anime series out to this date.. its just wonderfull..\n\nAnywhoo thats all i have to say about it :) thanks\n/Hano\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Possibly the greatest anime I've ever seen. No exaggeration, no joke about it. \nIn an anime what should be the measuring stick for manga adaptations, FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood left me speechless by the end of episode 63 and also a little downcast when it wrapped up with 64. \nMy favorite thing about Brotherhood is simply its plot. I can't go into too much detail here, but the way everything comes together by the final season and how it ties back to most of the characters makes it one of the most complex and wondrous plots I've seen to date. So complex in fact, I'd recommend\n          \n        keeping a notepad with you as you marathon the series (because believe me, you won't be able to just watch one episode and then walk away) and jot down the questions that float to mind because while they will claw at your mind and demand answers, they will all be answered within time. And it's jaw-dropping when some of them do!\nAs opposed to other animes, Brotherhood introduces over thirty well-rounded and developed faces that stick in your mind and hold traits/personalities that make them both easy to remember and to identify with. From the state military, to the homunculi, to the foreign faces that accompany the Elric brothers on their journey, most of these characters, much like the ones from Fairy Tail, each have their own in-depth backstories, most of which come together in the end, and overall prove that even the supporting cast doesn't always have to be boring. \nI'm not too observant on OST's, but Brotherhood's is not one to be easily discarded. If you have a good memory for background music, more then likely a few of these pieces will be left stuck in your head. Some of its more recurring pieces like \"The 5th Lab\" and \"Dissident's Creed\" are among my favorites and add the ominous tone the scenes paired with them are going for. Not to mention the five openings and closing songs, op 1 \"Again\" makes it as one of the catchiest and most detailed of anime openings I've seen. \nWhether you prefer dub or sub, you can't say that all dubs are bad without giving Brotherhood's a chance. It's Funimation's best work as far as I'm concerned, and each voice actor/actress pours each line from their mouth with the emotion and tone their respective character deserves. Specifically Vic Mignogna, Travis Willingham, Troy Baker and Ed Blaylock knock their respective roles out of the park! \nCompared to the 2003 series, I simply believe Brotherhood surpasses it in every way, due to the fact that for me, an anime is more enjoyable when the anime is traced right from the manga, due to it being the author's intended beginning, middle and end. \nNeedless to say again, Brotherhood just blew me away!

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    Personally, I liked the first FullMetal Alchemist series better, and I wasn't too keen on the idea of the anime fallowing the manga.\nStory- On anime-planet I rated this a 8.6, but here I an only rate it an eight. Even though it had taken a different direction from the first and switched to manga based instead.. It still kept its interesting and luring capture to it. But it kinda bores me more than the last one. One reason being that by fallowing the manga it just gave itself a major spoiler without really trying. You already know what is coming, and what's going to happen\n          \n        so really that was highly annoying on its own. You have certain parts that felt sped up, you have character's that are different and over show the emotions. Basically the same mask of a summary but with a major spoiler.\nArt (or Animation)- A nine. I did enjoy it more so then anything else really. Its better than most animes and has a more lighter feel towards it combined with dark contrasts, monstorious scenes, and slightly good blood. (it didn't look a nearly as pant.)\nSound- Seven. Before anyone yells at me for ranking the sound seven, I do have my reasons. Mostly it is because of the alchemy, emelements, and metal clashing with each other that I noticed something off. If you have normal hearing you wouldn't hear it the first few times, unless you re-watch and listen very closely. Everytime fight scenes happened I could hear something else in the background. It was faint but I could hear it when ever water splashed, fire roared, metal clashed, etc. That was very annoying to know and hear. But the sound did match with its destend target, even though it was slightly off as well.\nCharacters- On anime-planet I rated this a 7.4 but here of course you have basic rating. There are many differences from these characters compared to the first anime series. Edward's shorter, lighter hair color, his eyes, he was shorter than before and didn't seem all adultish. He over-reacted a bit with sadness and didn't over-react as much when it came to being called short. Alphonse other then annoying voice changes and a slightly brighter tone there really is not difference other then he can use alchemy with just his hands now. Winry--- still annoying to me, she had more reaction which didn't make her so bad but I still see her as an annoying girlie girl with a metal fetish. Roy the same only more pervy. Riza.. I'm glad to say they didn't mess with her much. In other words they were good and somewhat decent. \nMy Enjoyable Rating for this- Well I can't say this easily, seeing as I am writing this while still watching but I have to rate it a 5 for now. My enjoyment for this weavers ever so often so its a medicore stances right now.\nMy Overall Rating for this- On anime-planet it was 8.5, but here I have to give it a plan eight. It was mostly the art, and an interesting plot that helped with the overall rating. \n        "},

However, in order to create something, the alchemist has to present something of equal value; this is the golden rule of alchemy. After losing their mother to a disease, Edward and Alphonse Elric try to resurrect her, an illegal taboo in the world of alchemy. Through the unsuccessful process Edward loses his arm and his leg and has to transmute Alphonse’s soul (which lost its body,) to a suit of armor. Afterward the two set off on a journey to find the legendary philosopher’s stone and use its magic to reunite with their bodies. In the process\n          \n        Edward joins the army and a much bigger plot unfolds.\nThe Highlights\nFoils: Brilliantly highlight the characteristics of the main characters.\nVisuals: Stunning even for a Bones‘ production.\nMusic: For the most part good; in some instances beautiful.\nPhilosophical references: Read some of the works of Kant and Schopenhauer and you will truly appreciate this masterpiece.\nMain characters: Always true to their personalities and characteristics.\nAction scenes: Masterful; the cherry on top of all the other great qualities.\nSymbolism: Is this anime or poetry?\nThe final scene: Words cannot properly describe it.\n\nWhat is the truth in morality and life? Who is truly “good” and “evil”? Through the journey of two young boys, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood comes up with its own answers to these questions; and quite successfully.\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood took all the impressive qualities from the first series and simply polished them. In the process of doing so, it practically eliminated all weaknesses from the first series and created a true work of art. The misplaced comedy was removed. Nearly no scenes which are intended to be dramatic are accompanied by slapstick humor. Brotherhood‘s visuals are of a considerably higher caliber and so are its action scenes. What truly separates FMA: Brotherhood from its original counterpart however is the way in which it explores profound philosophical themes. The level of depth in Brotherhood‘s story is astounding. It avoids any form of fillers, unlike the original, and uses every single one of its episodes effectively. Take any episode out of FMA: Brotherhood and it will be missing a vital organ in its body.\nFMA: Brotherhood is essentially an exploration into morality and the many philosophical ideals that have governed humanity. Edward and Alphonse’s journey to regain their bodies is symbolic of the show’s journey to build a true moral body of its own. In the act of regaining their bodies, Edward and Alphonse must also build on their ideals and morality. The various characters in their journey each bring their own ethics to the table. In General Armstrong and Fort Briggs we see an influence from Darwin‘s survival of the fittest. In “Father” we see Nietzsche‘s philosophy of the “ubermensch” (the super person who has the power and the right to rise above all those weaker than him.) The philosophical references are endless; ranging from Schopenhauer‘s “will to be” and pessimism, to Hume‘s skepticism. The true merit of this anime’s philosophical journey however lies not only in the various references but in its answer to all the questions. It does not simply throw a bunch of references out there to appear intellectual. It brings all of them together in order to give its own answer. An answer which eventually takes the side of Kantian philosophy in stating that the true “goodness” of our actions lies in our intention.\nToo many animes have such flatness in their characters, that they could easily be likened to what they actually are: pixels. FMA‘s characters are not just complex but contain an incredible honesty in themselves. Their personalities are alive and carry on throughout the entire series. Even when characters change, they do it in a way unique to their own being. The amount of detail and effort this show puts into characters is astonishing. Even the foils are among the best in anime. Never is a character brought forth without delivering a crucial message to the story.\nOn top of the wondrous substance are also breathtaking aesthetics. I enjoyed every single one of the introduction and ending theme songs, and the background music can at times be beautiful. The action sequences are accompanied by intense tunes and detailed sound effects. The visuals are absolutely fantastic, even for Bones. The landscapes and towns are visually stunning, the clothes and character designs are thought out to the finest detail, and facial expressions are shown with a carefulness few anime can match.\nFullmetal Alchemist is so much more than what this review writes of it. There is only so much I can say without spoiling it. That is what great anime do. Fullmetal Alchemist is one of those few anime in which a fan of literature such as myself can find a substance and profundity that parallels that of a great novel. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood tells the story of a boy who, through his outer and inner journey, will establish an understanding of the moral essence which connects every human being.\n        "},

I've seen countless of shows, both anime and live-action TV shows, and I can say this is by far one of the most incredible and epic viewing experience I have ever been greeted with. I am glad that I  decided to watch it almost a decade after its release, and I'm a little bit salty I was reluctant watching this \"mainstream\" show. I truly believe this is a must to watch in regards of its fabulous storytelling and amazing character development. I have never seen a show where\n          \n        its side characters, or \"randoms\" (that are not the main focus of the plot), become a significant character in itself despite being a \"support\" or \"side\". They are truly not side characters; as every person, figure, and animal has a profound impact on the Eldric brothers' morals, and the encompassing story that surrounds them.\nI won't make it lengthy, as the synopsis gives a decent indication on what the story is about---however there is more beyond the story. It's the cliche journey that everyone must take, and that is what the Eldric brothers, and dozens of \"side\" characters go through. The characters feel so alive, so filled with exuberance and vitality that it is a truly unique experience to live through. \nIf you are looking for an anime, tv show, or fantastic time, watch this. This isn't #1 on MAL for no reason. It's #1 because it's a masterpiece. That is one of the Truth I can provide you. The rest is up to you to discover its message. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Before watching I had indeed seen the original FMA, I thought it was good a bit sketchy at times and I appreciate what they tried to achieve with that series. But one problem with that series is that it didn't get me hooked, the series pace was addled, slow at times then awfully fast, it skipped over parts that personally I thought needed explaining. And the ending I found to be too ambitious as you have to watch a continuation film. All the same it was fun for what it was. \nHowever, Brotherhood is a completely different ball game. The start of the series is\n          \n        pretty quick as it skims over the stuff covered in the previous series so its was a bit much to take, but after that the series matured and gave a thoroughly gripping and intense story that for me was not predictable in the slightest. \nThe art style shocked me when I came into watching this as it was different from FMA. It has a more simplistic style which I love especially in the humorous scenes I feel that the style adds to the hilarity. Man! the action sequences though, they were animated so beautifully and colourful. That's something Brotherhood doesn't skimp out on is the colour its vibrant and really sets a scene, from the intensity of the scenes with the antagonists to the peaceful interactions with our heroes. I would personally say that FMA has the hold over brotherhood in this area though, but the animation was still of a high standard. \nOne of the very masterful things this anime achieves is almost every character in the series is so beautifully fleshed out. I found myself caring for so many characters in this series and its something ive rarely seen in all the animes I have watched. \nEd and Al this is their show and their characters are so lovable and you're always rooting for them, Brotherhood added new elements to them which came as a shock in comparison to the original but the thing is that it made sense for some of the actions they made. But if you're reading this you should already know how good these characters are. Their dad however is almost completely different from FMA hes more developed and actually does a lot more. His backstory was a nice addition and the events that lead him to this story were great. However I didn't like how his character arc ended, it made sense but personally I disagree with it.  \nMustang was one of my highlights watching the original, I loved what he stood for and how was willing to do anything to get the best outcome and in this, they added even more compelling and emotional scenes with him which truly made me love the character even more. This series however added so much more story to his team, hawk-eyes struggle, Armstrong's heritage. Oh! did I forget to say the Armstrong's ROCKED, they were nuts from beginning to end MAN THEY WERE SO GOOD!!!\nNow to the MVP, Ling. Guys Ling I feel is such a well rounded character and to have Greed be his *associate* just made me love him even more. I found him absolutely undoubtedly hilarious I was in stitches with some of the things he did. His reasoning to be there was stupid but i loved it, his willingness to achieve his goal was idiotic but I loved it. Did I mention his action sequences were stellar I personally feel that him and the Xingese have some of if not the best action sequences and their fighting style was SO GOOD! so yeah if you haven't already guessed I liked Ling.\nThe Homunculi were incredible antagonists in this series, I liked them better in this series rather than the previous because in the previous I felt like the traits they had were way too predictable, and they were pretty weak as well. In this series they are strong, vicious, violent and live up to their names at times I actually felt like they were going to win, they rivalled the protagonists, but man I LOVE TO HATE PRIDE!!! \nI cant end without mentioning that the Xingese characters were a shock to see enter the story as they didnt exist in the original. And they were so fresh and different compared to the characters we already had established. It was nice to see other countries in this incredibly well built world.   \nThe voice acting in this series is very well done, it never lacked and was encapsulating and its some of the best I've heard in anime. \nThe story was compelling, always had me on the edge of my seat and rooting for everyone. The north arc possibly my favourite part of this series, as it introduces even more world building and new characters and the events that happen in that part of the series were so unpredictable, I will never forget that arc and how vital it was to the story.\nSo on a final not this series is incredible. It must be watched and suggest watching it after the original. I'm thankful it was suggested to me and it will forever be one of my favourite animes.\n"},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    Before I get into this review, please keep in mind my overall score for the anime is a 9. This review is going to seem mainly negative simply due to the fact that its positive aspects have been raved about by millions of fans for years. Therefore, I'm going to focus on some of the negative aspects that I feel are widely overlooked. \nNevertheless, FMA: Brotherhood is a truly excellent anime that deserves most of the praise it receives. It has a wide cast of fleshed out characters (both protagonists and antagonists) with clear motivations and tells a cohesive story with minimal (if any) contradictions/plot\n          \n        holes. The anime also explores many topics including but not limited to human nature, morality, how \"good\" and \"evil\" are simply based on perspective, etc. All in all, Brotherhood is a show with minimal flaws that definitely deserves its spot as a classic within the Shonen genre.\nWith that being said, I still feel that this show is slightly overrated. This is largely in part due to how fans of the show treat it as an untouchable masterpiece that sets standards which all other anime have yet to reach. It's one thing to say FMA: Brotherhood is your favorite anime; however, the amount of fans I've seen claim that Brotherhood is the definitive best anime of all time and even go as far to tell other people they might as well not even watch anime after Brotherhood since none can even come close to the standards it sets is asinine. Brotherhood is the best anime of all time by a long shot? Really? Even when anime like Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Code Geass, Steins;Gate, Gurren Lagann, Gintama, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Monster, HunterxHunter, Rurouni Kenshin, and Yu Yu Hakusho exist? Again, whether or not Brotherhood is your favorite anime is your prerogative but discouraging others from seeking other shows when there are plenty of masterfully executed anime in existence is just plain ignorant.\nBrotherhood is no perfect anime. Even though the flaws are minimal, they still exist. \nOne of the issues of the show that was jarring to me were the ill-timed comedy moments that completely cut all tension from the scene. For example, when Ed and Al are at Briggs and Kimblee arrives to visit them with Winry the scene should feel tense. We as an audience along with Ed and Al are aware that Winry is being used as a hostage in this situation. However, instead of Ed and Al appearing as serious they turn into chibi form and comically ask what Winry is doing there. Even though Ed and Al are worried about the situation all tension from the scene is cut for the audience since its played for a comedy gag. \nAnother issue with the show is that some of the themes it tries to present lack enough context to be fully realized. For example, in episodes 53-54 we're presented with the message that seeking things purely out of revenge is wrong and corrupts the soul. We're presented with this theme when everybody tries to stop Mustang from killing Envy. The problem with this scene is that it had never been established throughout the previous episodes that seeking revenge for the killer of Hughes was the main driving force for his actions. All we ever got was one scene where Mustang asks King Bradley who the killer of Maes Hughes was. That one scene isn't enough to establish that seeking vengeance is constantly shrouding Mustangs mind. Therefore, when Mustang is about to kill Envy and Riza points a gun at him and tells him to stop all I could think was \"why?\" Envy has committed numerous sins against humanity including starting a war that led to a genocide. He needed to die ASAP. But instead, everyone is opposed to Mustang killing Envy with Riza offering to kill him instead and she even goes as far as threatening Mustang that if he gives in to his anger she'll kill him then kill herself. I'm sorry but this just felt like it came out of nowhere. Is it really so bad if Mustang kills Envy out of anger and hate? Is him killing a monster that's responsible for the death of millions out of vengeance really going to cause him that much psychological damage? While I understand the message of the scene, I personally feel that it could have been executed much better.  \nIn conclusion, even though I have my gripes with the show I still respect the hell out of it and consider it a greatly executed project that anime fans should definitely add to their plan to watch list if they haven't already seen it."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    FMAB is the type of show that makes the viewer think due to its insights about topics ranging from religion and power to life and insecurities all whilst keeping a firm ground in its gripping plot and relatable characters (which should always come first unless a show is making a point about doing otherwise). If you couldn't tell from that run-on, I really love this show and have thus decided to make it my first subject of review on this site (so bear with me :3). Here we go...\nStory - 10: Fullmetal's story is truly what binds all the otherwise enjoyable aspects of the show\n          \n        into one of the most celebrated works in all anime. The brothers come from a place of hurt and vulnerability, as revealed with their backstory, and find themselves thrust into a well-developed world in an effort to find the Philosopher's Stone. While this may seem cliche, particularly in comparison with popular shonen titles, this is far more than a couple kids with a dream and a documentation of the overcoming of the obstacles to that dream. Behind the seemingly simple quest for the Stone is a much grander scheme by the secret puppet-masters of the government. One of the most compelling aspects of watching FMAB in its entirety is seeing how the Stone is integrated with this scheme, and how they get more intertwined as more is revealed about the plot and characters. I credit this toward the story's brilliant pacing, which honestly came across as the most impressive part of the show's writing my first time through. Each episode leaves you wanting to see and know more of the world and plot, all the while careful as to how much information is revealed each episode. By the time the final episode is up everything is revealed and wrapped up neatly, which is an impressive feat for a show that has so damn much going on. Overall, I think the story is as good as it could've been, and I felt very satisfied with spending my time watching it unfold.\nArt - 8: Considering there were six years in between the original FMA adaptation and the show I'm reviewing now, it comes as no surprise that FMAB is a definite upgrade in animation. The fight sequences as well as character expressions and movements are considerably more fluid than the original, adding in a lot of ways to the depth of the characters. This change especially benefits the emotional scenes, which rely on this expressiveness and emotion that the improved animation adds to truly get across to the audience. The original FMA fell considerably flat in this category and I think it may be one of the core reasons as to why Brotherhood simply comes across as better to so many people, since the emotions and resolves of the characters are one of the primary appeals of the show. That being said, a possible complaint one might have with the art is that everything is animated the same; in other words, none of the villains or homonculi really comes across as menacing for their animation (except Gluttony), but rather their design. This may cause the viewer to get a tad bored after a while, but there is good reason that the world is drawn in this way, which is consistency; for a show that bases so much of its appeal in being consistent in as many realms as possible, a consistent art style that doesn't surprise or astound but does what it needs to could not be more fitting. With all this in mind, FMAB's art is good-looking and solid, but knows that is not the show's centerpiece, and thus tries to do no such thing.\nSound - 7: The soundtrack of Brotherhood is not the greatest addition to the story as I've seen other shows do, but is still very solid. While suspense is especially present in the lineup, the music covers an array of emotions that is diverse and are placed accordingly with the events of the show, as a soundtrack should. The only real complaint I have about it is the repetition that becomes frankly noticeable during the middle chunk of the show. During these episodes, the suspenseful violin track is used virtually every episode whenever something important is about to happen, which began to get on my nerves after a while. However, the final battle in Central as well as the episodes leading up to it do a great job in varying the tracks way more, and I'm pretty sure some new ones are used as well. This significantly adds to the momentum of this long sequence of ending events, and pretty much makes up for the slight repetitiveness of episodes prior to it. Besides the soundtrack, the voice acting was great, especially the homonculi, who all had voices that fit them perfectly. Aside from them, all of the cast work really well together, particularly Romi Park, who brought both Edward's obnoxious/stubborn and sensitive sides to life.\nCharacters - 10: The characters of FMAB are well-loved (Edward is one of the most liked characters on MAL) and for a reason. Our main cast consists of characters who have relatable personal darknesses and insecurities, but also who have a lot of heart. The brothers, while haunted by their past, have placed each others' lives in their hands, and will do anything to protect one another. While this is the most outward display of caring between characters, there are also instances such as Mustang and Hawkeye, who put faith in each other despite the dark experiences they had in Ishvala. However, sympathy is not the only thing the cast must draw out of the viewer; they must also entertain, and Brotherhood is no exception. The entire main cast displays great chemistry and have well-written dialogue, all of which contributes greatly to the development of each individual. As for the supporting cast, the majority of them are completely buyable as characters (Olivier, Ling, and Ross are all supporting roles that bring something to the table). There are a few vaguely developed state alchemists under Mustang's command that do feel rushed at times, but otherwise, FMAB's characters are just about perfect.\nEnjoyment - 9: My enjoyment of this series is deeply rooted in its characters and its ability to pull off a truly compelling narrative unlike any other. Every episode has a purpose, every character adds to the chemistry (except, perhaps, a few background characters), and the themes are brilliantly fleshed out and are clearly written with the intent of making the viewer think. The only reason I didn't give this category a 10 is because after having rewatched it, I realized how important the element of mystery and suspense was to my initial enjoyment. I also reflected on how slow some moments ended up feeling because of it, resulting in my giving this category a 9. I simply feel that a show should be able to withstand a re-watch just as well as the first run through (if not, maybe a little worse) to get a 10 in enjoyment. \nOverall - 10: While I did find it hard to enjoy Brotherhood going through it a second time around as much as the first time, I can still respect just how well-put together this whole thing is. I recommend Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood to anyone who considers themselves an anime fan, particularly someone who has been put off of anime recently by boring, cliche shows; for this is not one of those shows.

But the only other conceivable audience for this low-budget, high-concept sci-fi action-thriller would be B-movie fanatics with a deep-rooted fondness for the sort of ’80s direct-to-video concoctions that once littered shelves at Blockbuster outlets. At one point, a character here pointedly asks for soda and popcorn as he watches action unfold on big-screen monitors. In real-life, however, viewers more likely will be consuming brewskies and microwaved burritos as\n          \n        the absurdities proceed apace.\nThe plot has something to do with a video-game developer who’s been implanted with a device that more or less turns him into a real-world first-person shooter, and has something else to do with an agoraphobic beta-tester forced to control the shooter’s action from the relative safety of his living room. There is a method to this seeming madness: Creed (Manu Bennett), the guy with the implant, wanted to build on his wartime experiences by designing technology that could transform normal soldiers into remote-controlled super-warriors. (Hey, did someone say “Universal Soldier?”) But that technology is turned against him by Kincaid (Linden Ashby), a vidgame tycoon with a vaguely defined scheme to disarm citizens and “keep guns in games” by using Creed and others as patsies to wreak havoc, elevate body counts, and otherwise tilt public opinion toward more restrictive gun-control laws. No kidding.\nMORE REVIEWS\nFilm Review: 'Bright'\nFilm Review: 'Hangman'\nLarenz Tate figures into the mix as Max, a cocky yet reclusive beta-tester who hasn’t left his house in years because – are you sitting down? – jealous rivals inadvertently shot his beloved dog while aiming at him. Kincaid forces Max to try his hand at controlling Creed in order to “get the bugs out” of the new technology. But Creed — who just happens to be a bone-breaking, throat-slitting, butt-kicking bad boy when he’s not working in the lab — manages to go rogue in order to free his wife (Sara Coates) from Kincaid’s clutches.\nFrom the opening credits, which unfold over news clips depicting terrible events ranging from 9/11 to the Aurora movie theater shootings, to the sporadic mentions of false-flag theories — evoking the JFK assassination, Creed refers to Lee Harvey Oswald as “a distraction” — “Beta Test” is fraught with indications that director Nicholas Gyeney, working from a script he co-wrote with Andre Kirkman, intends this nonsense to work on some level as a cautionary tract about… well, some kind of clear and present danger. (Gun-hating lefties, maybe?)\nUltimately, however, “Beta Test” works best (and even then, just barely) as an homage to those Reagan/Bush Era quickies designed to slake the hearty appetites of undiscriminating VHS renters. The preponderance of interior shots, the mad dashes through conspicuously underpopulated streets, the ’80s porn-star mustaches on plot-recapitulating newscasters, the aggressively loud VH1-ready musical score, the melodramatic line readings by actors desperate to hard-sell generic dialogue  — really, just about the only thing that’s missing here is a swaggering cameo by Wings Hauser. Instead, we get a broadly villainous turn as a sadistic henchman by Kevon Stover, who looks and sounds like what you’d have to settle for if you went shopping at Kmart for Danny Trejo.\nFilm Review: 'Beta Test'\nReviewed online, Houston, July 21, 2016.

After finishing this I was completely blown away by it. This exceeded my expectations and became one of my all-time favorites. \nThe story was intense and kept my attention throughout, and had quite a few heart-wrenching moments that really stuck with me even after they passed. There were moments in the show where I was mesmerized and became emotional because of how beautifully done they were. The action was great to marvel\n          \n        at as well, yet the emotional baggage is always present which makes them even more engaging and suspenseful than just a flashy battle. \nAlmost every character on the show is fascinating in their own way, with some quickly becoming my favorites. The development of the plot with these characters interwove into something remarkable. I found myself caring about a lot of these characters and becoming engaged with their conflicts and personality quirks. The protagonists, Edward and Alphonse were extremely likable for me and shone extremely bright themselves. Often when watching a series one can become more attached to or interested in a cool side character and even become annoyed with the protagonists, but for this show the protagonists were some of the best parts of the show which was very refreshing. \nThis is a Shonen series that really stands out. It isn't heavily reliant on a formulaic approach to the story, and engages the audience in its own special way by breaking certain tropes. The tropes that it may reinforce are done right and don't come across as forced or overdone. \nAll in all there are so many memorable moments, touching characters, and a story that works beautifully and left me thinking about the series ever since. An unforgettable series that doesn't drag itself out too long, nor does it end too quick. The story is wrapped up in a thoughtful form that was truly moving.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Objectively, a flawless masterpiece. This is the manga adaption that follows the manga through and through. If you have watched the older version of the anime, it may be a good watch, but nothing like this. To put it simple, this anime is not short, but not long either. It hits where it needs to end correctly. It starts from A to a whole lot of dramatic fun to B. The story tells is precise and not confusing, but very complex with many twist plot holes that connects to the end that finish any loose ends. It's an absolutely stunning anime in ever section, from\n          \n        story, to art, to sound, and to character. But more importantly, it ultimately entertain the audiences to no end. More importantly, it stands alone with no crazy \"movie sequel\" or a sequel in general and kept true to us to the very end. While, not my favorite anime, it is my top 5 to watch both subjectively and objectively. Does it deserve the hype? Hell yes. Is it overrated? No, not at all, it deserve to be a highly rated anime. I'm not only recommending to watch this anime, I'd force to watch it. And if you don't like it, well, each of every own opinion, but seriously, you must be ices if you don't like FMA:B. I suppose if you don't like anime in general, then you wouldn't like this, but then, why would you be in MAL in the first place. If this review isn't enough and you want more depth of my review, say no more, it'll be on the bottom.\nWithout spoiler!\nStory: Too amazing! Two brother embark on a journey to find a way to get their bodies back. However, in order to get there, they would need information. And the best way to get to their goals is to be the dog of the military (metaphorically). Upon entering the military, they found out about things that they shouldn't and as a consequences, they get sucked into many unfortunate situation that eventually involves the truth of how they could get their bodies back, but in order to do so, there is a dreadful truth. When learning that dreadful truth, they sought another way to get their bodies, but before they know it, the brothers was already destined to meet their fate as a sacrifice. Again, without spoiling anything much, it's basically about two brothers trying to get back their bodies because when they were young, they committed a forbidden technique that causes their body to be somewhere else. \nArt: What is there to say, it's an anime. I like it, but it doesn't mean that you have to like it. \nSound: Too many awesome Openings & Endings. Not to mention, every background sounds are so appropriate for each moment, like when there is death, you can hear the sadness. When something is scary, it can be dreadful.\nCharacters: EVERY DAMN CHARACTERS ARE INTRIGUING AND COMPELLING! Enough said. \nEnjoyment: I think I've watched, at least, 3 times already from episode 1 to the final. Sometimes when I feel like it, I'll watch it again. It has sadness, despair, humor, happiness, tragedy, dramatic, emotional scenes. Each scenes felt necessary and not pointless to watch. Even flashbacks are good.\nOverall: A true masterpiece that cannot be copied. The genius in this work is far too amazing to let go. If you haven't watch FMA:B, do so now because you'll end up regretting it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I'm a bit disappointed with this show. After seeing so much people praising it, I watched it and found too many issues for it to be considered one of the best animes I ever watched.\nThe anime starts with an overall superb quality in all the areas. Then I think it's impossible for an attentive viewer not to notice that from the middle of the series onwards the overall quality decays a lot. And that applies for almost everything, from the animation to the plot, any exception I would make here is for the soundtrack, which is amazing.\nThe animation is great at the beginning, with fights\n          \n        showing all movements and blows in detail, with the camera shaking and you getting the feeling of action in the air. Towards the end of the series, however, some fights go as low as to show some alternate static frames of one character's blow represented by a flashy line drawn across the frame, and the other character falling to the ground and his face punched: a feature worth of the animes made back in 1990.\nThat decay in quality is what disappoints me the most. The plot also starts very emotional and engaging, with very legitimate and moral questions being approached. The character's motives and emotions are explored in depth, even though a large cast is presented, with new characters being introduced each two new episodes (more or less). \nHowever, after a while some mess is done with the characters and the plot as well. A character as distinct and badass as Kimblee - which you thought was supposed to give a hard time to everyone, which they spend a lot of time developing, going as far as to show flashbacks of the Ishvalan war and the connections between him and the other characters (like Roy Mustang and Riza Hawkeye) - simply disappears for a lot of time with no explanation and once he comes back he is given an end as quick and meaningless as his re-appearance.\nThen lackluster characters such as Zampano, Darius, Heinkel and Jerso make it through the end without a good development. It's even annoying to see how they engage in the fights and everything else while lacking a motive to do so, whereas you also don't know a lot about them and they also lack personality.\nAnd there's so much I could go on with. The melodramatic scenes, the long, dull and annoying humanist discourses every 2 to 3 minutes - all of this happens when the end of the show is nearing - is just obnoxious and gives the feel that the person who wrote the first 30 episodes is hardly the same who wrote the last 34.\nAll of this, in addition to the end, which honestly is an attempt to make every single character have a happy way to make it to the end of the story (meaning they didn't only had to make it through, it was also required that they'd be HAPPY as the show ends) sacrifices A LOT of the show's quality. So don't be fooled. It is a good anime, but all these reviews on the internet rating it 9.5/10/ Best Anime Ever are quite unrealistic and I go as far as to say that if it wasn't for the way I was clung to the characters because of the beginning of the series, I'd hardly watch it all the way through the end.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    I must note I have only watched the Anime of FMA-Brotherhood, not read the manga and not seen the first anime version of this either. Because of all the praise this series has been receiving, my expectations were pretty high. And frankly, during the entire time I watched this, I've not been into it as much as expected when reading all of the reviews. Not to say I didn't like FMA-B, but I feel the concept was good and a bit more was in store than came out now.\nStory:\nThe whole principle of Alchemy and later Elixerology has something mystic and spoke to me a lot.\n          \n        Equivalent exchange, leading to the loss of body (parts) with the two main characters set the scene for a good story. Now, the reason I say good story and not great is really because I feel there was more potential here. As the story progresses I've hardly been surprised by plot changes and progress continuously is kind of obvious. Strangely, I even feel as if the story could unfold itself quicker, while I read in previous reviews the pace of FMA-B is actually quite high. Therefore I'm not too sure if I was satisfied with the ending, mainly because you could see it coming from far, far before.\nArt:\nReally good. Not much to add.\nSound:\nOne of the best anime when looking at sound. Good intro('s), hardly skipped them. During episodes not a lot of music stuck with me, bot never bothered me either.\nCharacter:\nI believe there was too little character development in Brotherhood. Now maybe more character development would have meant more episodes characterized as \"filler\", but I don't think that would have bothered me. Still, the main characters I believe are strong enough for a fair review.\nEnjoyment:\nNice story in a nice setting. Didn't exactly deliver what I expected, but overall I never felt the urge to drop this one. Overall very enjoyable.\nOverall:\nVery good anime and I can understand all the buzz. Just not my top favourite.\n"},

They try to bring back their mother to life using alchemy. However, the experiment goes terribly wrong, Alphonse's body is destroyed and Ed loses a leg and arm. Edward is able to save Alphonse by putting his soul in a suit of armor. They then go on a adventure to try to bring their bodies back.\nThe story looks really simple, but it is told in a beautiful way and very well paced.

I really don't have much to say here.\nSound 9/10\nThe openings and endings are very nice. My favorite opening and ending is the fourth one. The music for fight scenes are really nicely done as well. I put 9/10 because I felt like the third ending could've been better but nonetheless all the songs are really good.\nCharacter 10/10\nThe characters are very nice. If I had to say a criticism of anime a bit is that they develop some characters really well (explaining their past and all of that), but they don't do that with other characters. Why can't they do that with all the characters? Well, FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood develops all their characters. I like every single character as they all serve the story in some way. Also, their villains are developed, which is also a criticism I have of anime sometimes is that the villains can be very one-dimensional at times.\nEnjoyment 10/10\nI really enjoyed this anime series better than the first FullMetal Alchemist series (2003). I had a lot of issues with the 2003 series because the pacing was really slow and I really couldn't deal with it. FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood just fixes all the issues. I loved every bit of it.\nOverall 10/10\nThis anime is a MUST WATCH for any anime fans and people looking to get into anime. FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a shonen in a way and even though you don't like shonens, you gotta watch this! This anime really sets expectations for what other animes should be like in a way. If you're looking to understand Edward's story, just watch like the first 15 episodes of the 2003 version, but really just watch FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I highly recommend it!\nThanks for reading. Let me know your thoughts on this review and any feedback you may have for me. Until next time!\n        "},

But for some reason, even though I liked the plot, I loved the characters, the art everything, I was never hyped up to watch the next episode. It was more like I was bored watching it, while other animes, I couldn't wait to see the next episode. I don't know why, but I just can't find THAT SOMETHING to keep me going. Like, I thought that when I started watching, the\n          \n        way the story progresses and the events that take place would make me GASP and like, make me hyped up to see what happens next, but never have I been hyped up to come home to watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. And even though this has such high rankings, from me as well, I find it weird for this particular anime to have higher rankings than animes that, I think are more to everyone's liking and get you hyped up.\nTHAT'S JUST ME BEING WEIRD THOUGH, SORRY, SORRY\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    Normally, when there is a remake most of the story stays the same. Just changing the visuals as in graphics and so, but not for this anime.\nIts like the whole story changed, and to be honest the story became much better. Though the core stays the same as in Alphonse and Edward looking to return their bodies, but there are new characters and story line changed contradicting with the old series, maybe following the manga more thoroughly.\nStory (8) - the story initially revolves around the Eliric brothers that performed a taboo alchemy ritual to revive their dead mother which resulted in Al's body being lost\n          \n        and Ed's leg and arm being lost. They start a journey to recover their old bodies and end up meeting a lot of interesting people on their long journey. The story blends a great sense of comedy and drama. Practically makes you cry in some places.\nArt (7) - the art is defiantly better than in the former series, especially the comedy craft they make the bodies sound and look funny. In my opinion the angry face of their master is Priceless.\nCharacters (9) the characters are well developed too, there is a story behind each one of them and that story unfold and unravels until the very end of the series. \nEnjoyment (8) - this is a series that will glue your eyes to the screen. Probably make you watch 30 episodes per day. Its truly amusing and has a way of pulling you in real soon.

Not like the first FMA, FMAB is full based on manga. FMAB is originally aired on TV in Japan from 5 April 2009 until 4 July 2010 and it has 64 episodes. FMAB getting positive critics and being the second highest rating on My Anime List (the biggest anime community) 9,21 from 80,077 voters (23 June 2012)\nFootage of the story\n	FMAB is the story about the struggle\n          \n        of two brothers to get a philosopher’s stone, a stone which can grant wish from the owner, for getting their bodies which missed because they broke the Alchemy’s law.	The story starts from their childhood. Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric are two brothers who live peacefully in a village with their parent. One day, their father leaves them without reason. not long after that, their mother is sick and passed away. They want to get back their mother from dead because they are loving their mother so much. So, with the knowledge of alchemy from their father’s books and from their teacher. They try to make a human transmutation which is forbidden to do in the alchemy’s law. They get a havoc after doing human transmutation which is failed. The older brother, Edward, lost his left leg and right hand. The younger brother, Alphonse, lost all of the entire body, but fortunately Edward can attach his soul into a suit of armor. They are regret for what they have done but try to forget and getting a better life. Then, they try to get their missing bodies by getting the philosopher’s stone. They must face Obstacles from Homonculus, a rebel hero, and from the government itself to get the stone. And their journey begins…\nReview:\n1. Story and Character (10/10)\n	The story is very solid, the tempo from each episodes is rather fast but it is enough to explain everything that we need to know without any confusion. The development of the characters is great. Important characters get enough explanation for their background and objectives. Many intrigues and twisted story keeping us difficult to guess the continuation. The story can also play the emotions of the audiences, such as cool action, fresh comedy, tragic scene, and a little of romance.\n2. Sound, Music, and Voice (9/10)\nThe Music are amazing and suit the scenes, like the sound of violin when there are sad scenes and full of passion music when there are action scenes. The opening and ending songs are easy-listening and worth for Japanese music-lover to collect the full version. The dubbers do great job because many of them are the same dubbers from the first anime. They make us who watched the first anime do not need to adapt for the new dubbers’ voice.\n3. Graphic (8/10)\n	The animation is much better than the first anime adaptation because the time difference of the release is 5 years, so the technology to make effect is better. but it is not very special comparing with other animes in the same year, but The action animation effect is good. Character design is brilliant so you can know the differences of the origin of the people, such as Chinese, Caucasian, and Negro.  \nConclusion\nFMAB is one of the best anime that everybody are going to love it.

AFter the initial startup though things get intense and the story just gets addicting.

Lol lol watch me mess up.\nAnyways..from reading previous reviews and reading comments made on the forums, I think people are being too critical of the new anime. It's only got /12/ episodes so far; give it a little break people, lol. Twelve episodes doesn't define if the anime is going to be brilliant or trash. My point being, as many people haven't read the manga and are only comparing it to the first anime, they're getting very wrong impressions. Yes yes I know, the first anime was good. However, going about and saying \"god, this is so /boring/, it's\n          \n        just retelling the same old story just rushed\" isn't fair. As a dedicated follower of the manga, this anime is going to have a VERY different plot--starting in about one or two more episodes, I believe. So please don't judge something as \"same old same old\" when it's just getting started, m'kay? ^^\nOkay, I'll just shut up about that now and get to the actual review..thing..of this.\nStory : 8\nSo far, Brotherhood is following pretty dang closely to the manga, which definitely makes me happy. I can assure you, the manga has a developed plot with interesting twists, characters, and very dark turns, while still keeping a nice blend of comedy in there. After our encounter with Greed, nothing will be at all like the first series; no Dante, no Wrath (well, no Wrath from the first series), no parrallel world, nothing like that. Hopefully the \"rushed\" feeling will also disappear, as Brotherhood will finally be caught up with the first series and can start with completely fresh material. (Note : The anime already has shown its share of fresh material, such as the eleventh episode, but meh.) \nBrotherhood as a story is keeping up well and its already shown its darker shades, such as the incident with Nina and Tucker, and Ed and Al's failed resurrection of their mother and its consequences. There have been some things from the story that has bothered me, though, like how many chapters have all been condensed into one episode. Some examples would be the second episode (probably the most rushed of all the series thus far), the eleventh, and the twelfth. Though most of it was stuff that doesn't really hurt the plotline itself if left out, still kind of disappointing. And though I've seen some people argue that it's not rushed at all, and some argue it's completley rushed, I'd give it a medium. There are many episodes (like eps. 4, which many complained about seeing the lack of Nina like in the first series) that only have one chapter to begin with, so yeah, it's not as rushed as it seems.\nThe comedy also isn't at its best; though it is a change from the complete darkness of the ending of FMA 1 and it fits the general mood of the manga FMA (having a great blend of seriousness, darkness, and comedy), some of the comedy isn't done as well as I'd expected. It seems like it fit more in the manga than it did in the animation, if you know what I mean. \n\nOverall Art : 7\nI give it a 7, as it definitely follows the manga art, but still not the best I've ever seen. The houses, like Ed and Al's home, generally irritate me because they seem so childish. It may resemble the manga version, but it /fits/ in the manga; in this series, it's silly. Some of the characters (like Hughes and Scar) seem plain stupid art wise, and bleh. From the preview, Greed didn't look that great either. Still, the art is good enough to be enjoyed when it's serious. \nSound : 7\nOnce again, I give it a 7. The music is growing on me admittedly, and come on, the beginning and ending themes are to die for. Not much of a real opinion here though.\nCharacter : 7\nIt hasn't gotten as far into the story yet to make a real opinion; characters don't develop much over a measley 12 episodes when there's such a larger piece of it to come. However, the characters so far are unique and interesting, as I've always found them. For those of you (like me) who were generally annoyed by Alphonse's character, fear not, for he has a much more developed and just plain different personality here. He is not at all the wimpy little brother we knew in FMA 1; he knows how to handle himself and has a much more mature character. As far as I can remember, the characters seem pretty much the same as they were in FMA 1 (for the mean time anyways, as far as it has gotten in this). So yeah..we need a bit more time to see how these characters develop.\nEnjoyment : 8\nPretty good so far; seeing the characters all back together and seeing the manga's true plot unfold in animation is undeniably enjoyable for fans of the manga. A bit rushed at times (like episode 2), but it's an enojyment in itself to watch Fullmetal Alchemist unfold. Comedy is a bit dull in places, though.\nOverall : 7\nMy overall review would be a 7, I suppose. Once the series gets to a certain point, I may come back and review to see if my opinion has changed at all. \n        "},

They get their own storyline within the main one and it intertwines with it.\nThird, this was a big one for me, the ending doesn't leave any questions behind. With all the twists and shocks, they're all answered somehow throughout the story.Basically, you finish the series feeling satisfied. At least that's pretty much how I felt. \nI know with many other animes it\n          \n        will end and I would be left wondering what exactly was solved. Usually where the anime leaves me hanging, the manga usually covers it, since most anime stray from it's original manga (if there is one). \nOf course with Brotherhood, it is like the manga pages just up and animated themselves. Granted I've never read the manga, but this is what I've heard. ^^\nThese are just a few of the reasons why I thought FMA: Brotherhood was such an epic anime. :)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    Since this is my first review I would try and not put as much spoilers as I could\nFullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, contains 64 episodes and has the genre of action, adventure, drama, fantasy, magic, shounen and military. This anime is rumoured to be one of the most overhyped anime and according to the eyes of various anime viewers, could be even overrated. This lovely anime sits on my anime list with an excellent score of nine since it gives you no fillers at all throughout the whole series and leaves you with a satisfied face after each episode.\nFMA Brotherhood starts off with the introduction of Isaac\n          \n        McDougal, the freezing alchemist with the military trying to capture him. This first episode was only shown in the anime and provides you with a satisfying amount of information about the military. The Youswell arc (Which I liked immensely) and the Train Kidnapping arc which were included in the manga sadly didn't get shown in the anime. The anime basically gives you a great starting episode that provides you with comedy, information and action. The ending was also a satisfying one and all plot holes were resolved during the end.\nCharacters: 9/10\nIn order for an anime to be good, it would need to require a cast of excellent and interesting characters to examine and that is exactly what this series has given us.\nFullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood follows the story of the main characters Edward and Alphonse Elric. Edward and Alphonse may look like your average shounen \ncharacters to the eyes of some people but they are actually not. Throughout the series, huge numbers of minor characters are introduced which take a huge impact on the character development of Edward and Alphonse. Talking about character development, most of the minor characters in FMA Brotherhood don't receive a satisfying amount of character development which is one of the elements that this series lacks on. On the other hand, the people who actually do receive immense character development are the most interesting to explore and examine for example my favourite FMA:B character: Scar. One point was lost due to the point that Father wasn't a satisfying enemy and just didn't suit my taste as a villain.\nSound: 8/10\nSound is also another important element that has to implemented correctly for a certain scene to sound good and FMA:B has done quite well on that. Throughout the series, FMA:B delivers to you a 6 excellent openings and a couple of alright endings that you might enjoy (My favourite being op 1). The OSTs also fit to the certain scene they are supposed to be in. Some certain OSTs also sound fantastic and might be a delight to your ears. Character voicing has also been implemented well throughout the whole series. FMA:B has done well on implementing their music and voicing correctly throughout the whole series and has chosen great openings and endings to use.\nAnimation: 8/10\nExcellent animation is required for a anime to shine brightly and this is presented averagely in FMA:B. I really liked the animation details in the landscape and characters but sometimes the animation would just lack out. The original FMA's animation just suited my taste better then FMA:B.\nStory: 7/10\nAn outstanding storyline is what makes a anime run and FMA:B has done averagely on that. The definition of the story could probably be shortened to \"Two brothers try and go find a red rock\" The storyline was bland and uninteresting and just sounded like the average story of a shounen anime (Which is probably one of the reasons why it is). However as the anime moves on this is not the case as the anime undergoes a huge amount of dark turns and plot twists which make the storyline more interesting.\nEnjoyment: 9/10\nThe enjoyment of an anime is what gets people to continue watching it and FMA:B had left me entertained all the time. The comedy scenes, the action scenes and most of the anime just had me entertained most of the time. The excellent characters, sound and animation just made me enjoy the anime more then I thought I would.\nOverall, I would suggest this anime out to anyone who hasn't watched it yet since it's has a excellent set of characters, sound and animation and is immensely enjoyable."},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This take on the fullmetal alchemist is far Superior than the last iteration of this franchise.\nWe follow the story of Edward Elric as well as Alphonse Elric, where they have commuted human taboo to resurrect their dead mother. It had gone terrible wrong where the creature they had summed wasn't their mother it was a abomination. After this creature was summed Edward lost his arm as a cost as well as his brother Alphonse, Edward exerts in \"He's my only brother my little brother.take my leg take my heart take anything but give my brother back\" This is how Alphonse was bounded to the armor\n          \n        by a blood seal, As well as that this is how Edward lost his arm and his leg and became a fullmetal alchemist.\nFrom a character development and progression stand point this anime starts out very quick, you are introduced to about a quarter of the characters in the first 8 episodes. When you hit about 20 episodes in nearly every episode will make you question yourself and humanity, as well as hit your soft point and make you cry on the floor like a baby because of how attached you where to a character.\nI have read the manga as well I have seen the first iteration of the franchise, If you are just starting to watch amines I would insists you watch this one.                       \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Simply put, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of the finest pieces of media I've laid eyes on. The world and lore are constructed in such a way that it leaves you wanting more, and the characters are written in such a way that even the worst of the antagonists you can feel some degree of sympathy or pity for, apart from a few who you grow to be in a love-hate relationship with. And then there's Shou Tucker.\nStory\nAn area where the show excels in particular. Throughout the series, you learn more about the shadowy past of the militaristic country Amestris, as well as the obviously\n          \n        China-like Xing and the tragic, horrifying past of Ishval. Throughout the series, more details are revealed about the countries and the world around the protagonists, uncovering a countrywide conspiracy that threatens the lives of them and everyone around them.\nIt doesn't let up on plot twists, either. I could name several different occasions where I was shocked, terrified, sad or all 3. This show knows how to wring emotions or shock out of you, and just when you think the plot will let up for a few episodes it pulls you straight back into the nitty gritty and never lets go. Even the obligatory recap episode is masterfully done, giving an insight into an important character's psyche and mindset, helping us learn about him and what he is.\nArt\nRather standard anime artstyle, however for the comedy moments it distorts itself into chibi faces and bodies that look absolutely adorable. An example of times like these are in the hugely entertaining ''4-panel comic theater'' OVAs, funny little shorts that parody major story events. \nThe series has the ability to alternate from these styles to a more serious style in a matter of seconds depending on the tone of the story, which is rather impressive. The peak of the animation is in the jaw-droppingly fluid fight scenes with multiple characters, which, late in the series, somehow get even better, spanning several episodes that all culminate in a satisfying end. It's hard to explain without spoilers, but you'll be amazed.\nSound\nThe OST is very good. Particularly, the track ''The Awakening'' is one of my favorite BGM pieces in anime. More importantly, the opening and closing themes are all AMAZING. They tonally fit the show, such as the final OP, ''Rain'' by Sid, which has an air of tragedy to it, yet is still hopeful. Like the whole show, really. By virtue of being the first, the first OP and ED will probably stick with you the most. If there's a weak spot, it would be the fourth OP in my opinion, while still excellent it's very very loud compared to the rest and really goes all out. Of course it's still fantastic and fits for that arc of the show.\nCharacters\nThis is what the show does undisputably well. Edward Elric, the titular Fullmetal Alchemist, goes through a realistic growth throughout the series, both physically and mentally. It is hard to talk about his growth without delving into spoilers, so I'll talk about my favorite part of the entire show. The villains.\nThe homunculi are the driving force between many of the acts in the series, and make for a formidable leigon of antagonists. Some are entirely sympathetic and innocent (Gluttony), some are absolutely hateable bastards who still get moments of sympathy (Envy, Pride, Wrath) but they all make for extremely compelling villains who I personally couldn't wait to see more of. \nEven the non-homunculi villains are extremely effective. Take Kimblee, the psychotic State Alchemist with a twisted moral foundation, or the mysterious Scar, who while appearing to be outright evil, has hidden depths and layers as well as genuienly understandable motives under the surface. That's not even getting into Shou Tucker (and to a lesser extent the cryptic Gold-Toothed Doctor), one of the most hated anime characters of all time and for good reason.\nApart from the villains and central characters, the side characters all have extremely compelling arcs that are as good if not better than the Elric brothers. Colonel Roy Mustang and Riza Hawkeye in particular have an arc running throughout the entire show that's extremely emotional, and is done incredibly. I couldn't possibly talk about them all here, so you'll have to wait and see.\nEnjoyment\nAs I stated at the start of this review, this anime is absolutely incredible. Every arc is masterfully done and concluded, with an amazing, fleshed out lore and universe that has massive potential to still be expanded (I'm not the only one who'd love a spin off about Xing). Every character is memorable for one reason or another, and honestly, there aren't any faults that I can think of right now. It's a masterpiece not just in anime, but in all of pop culture it's incredibly unique and nothing else is quite like it. \nSimply put? Watch it.\nAs a sidenote, watch the dubbed version. It's a very very good dub, and is nearly unanimously agreed to be better than the sub. Take time to get used to it and you'll appreciate it.\nSecond sidenote: watch the outtakes. They're amazing."},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Before I state my opinion about the show I‘d like to say that this is an anime that holds a special place in my heart, seeing as FMA (Fullmetal Alchemist), and FMAB (Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood) were my very first anime series (well, not including the Pokemon, Naruto and etc. episodes I used to watch on TV as a kid). These were the series that first showed me how great the anime medium can be. That said, this review may or may not be a little biased because of how special the series are for me personally.\nIn short I would describe FMA as a great story\n          \n        about the adventures of two brothers, their quest to achieving their goal, their hardships along the way and how their relationship grows stronger despite that. Throw in some likable characters they interact with while on their journey, great fight scenes, lighthearted comedy and a lot of alchemy and you got a general idea what FMA is about.\nStory (10)\nThe story has a clear goal to move towards, but it doesn’t mean that it’s the only thing you’re going to see here. There are plenty of smaller segments, that are kind of short stories of their own, but they don’t go too far off the main story. Most tie into the main story in some way or another and I don’t think I’ve seen anything that felt like it could have been skipped or was unnecessary.\nMy main complaint with FMAB is that the first 12 or so episodes felt rushed, but if you’d like to watch the story unfold in more detail the first 30 or so episodes of the first anime adaptation of this series (in 2003) covers mostly the same story just in a slower pace.\nThe beginning aside, in my opinion, FMAB beats the first adaptation in the ending department by a mile. I won’t spoil it for  you if you haven’t seen it yet, but because of this, if you only have the chance to watch one of the adaptations, I’d recommend watching brotherhood, even though both of the adaptations have their own different charms and are worth a watch.\nArt (10)\nThe animation style isn’t overly cute or overly rough and the colors aren’t too bright nor are they too bland. The animation is fluid and I didn’t notice any major faults with it.\nI think it’s also worth mentioning that this show has one of if not the best fight scenes, especially involving some sort of magic (in this case – alchemy) that I’ve seen so far in anime.\nSound (10)\nThe OPs ranged from ok to good, even thought I personally liked the first adaptation’s OP songs better.\nI have no complaints about the sound effects. They aren’t out of place and work well.\nPersonally, I have seen the dubbed version of this anime, and I have to say, the DUB is really good. The voice actors did a good job and they fit their characters well. If you like myself don’t usually watch dubbed anime because a lot of the times it just doesn’t seem to work, but don’t mind it when the DUB is good, I’d recommend at least trying the dubbed version of FMA.\nCharacter (10)\nAs I have mentioned earlier, I find the characters very likable. Let’s start with the main characters – Edward and Alphonse or Ed and Al for short. The two brothers and their relationship is one my favorite parts of this show. They are smart and capable, yet not perfect. Both of them make mistakes and learn from them. Even though they share a very strong sibling bond with each other, they still disagree and fight at times. These are all things that make them believable human characters and it brings me joy to watch them change and grow over the span of the story.\nThe brothers aren’t the only characters that change and grow over time, though. The more important supporting characters also develop quite a bit throughout the story, including the villains.\nSpeaking of villains, FMA has some really good ones. I unfortunately can’t go into much detail about them without spoiling the story, but I can say for sure that I rarely ever see anime villain characters that I love, or should I say love to hate as much as I do in this show. Their motives make sense and I was even able to sympathize with some of them to an extent. Perhaps most importantly, the villains aren’t villains just for the sake of the story having someone for the main characters to defeat, but instead they are actual characters with good reasons for acting the way they do.\nEnjoyment (10)\nIt probably comes as no surprise, when I say that I enjoyed this anime to bits. It was the first anime (well the second if you count the first adaptation as a separate anime, which I personally do not) that I’ve ever seen from start to finish, it has what I consider to be a great story with some of the best characters I’ve ever seen and it probably helps that I am very fond of elements such as alchemy, strong sibling and/or friend relationships and action in not just anime, but other entertainment mediums as well. And to top it all off – a nice and clean animation style and a fitting soundtrack, what’s there not to love?\nOverall (10)\nIs this anime for everyone? Well, no, I doubt such an anime exists, but that aside I think this anime can be easily enjoyed by most anime viewers. It has a great story for those that want one, great action for those that enjoy shows better when there’s a lot of movement involved, characters that feel human for those that want to see characters change and grow, comedy for those that like to have a good laugh with their anime and etc.\nFullmetal Alchemist really is a great anime, and I think it’s one that you should at least give a try to. Who knows, maybe you’ll find something else it’s worth praising for? Or maybe you’ll find the exact opposite – a major fault that has escaped my attention? Either way, I hope you give it a try."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    This show made me laugh, cry and feel sick. Although it is very plot-driven, the characters were appealing enough, the fighting was well done, and several hard themes such as cival war, identity, humanity and the strong bond between two brothers were woven into this much appealing story. The Alchemy element really adds to the whole and could well serve as an example for the scientific progress, including its ethical side. The plot is complex, confusing at times, but well-told. Every time you think you get the story, it becomes more complicated and makes you wonder if there is an end to the revelations. \nThis\n          \n        is the first anime that I have encountered where within a few episodes a child that you actually care about, dies. I do not like drama for the drama, but this occurence fits well within the story that the writers wanted to tell us: the human deficit when it comes to choices of life and death and all the trauma that it depicts, while on the other hand the question rises how to remain and act human. \nEd and Al are brothers who have committed a terrible sin. It hits back in their face multiple times during the series but also gives them a strong drive to do what they do: Ed being a State Alchemist, or rather, a dog of the military, and his younger brother Al supports him. Their main goal is to get their bodies back. \nThe result of their terrible sin, which they committed to bring their beloved mother back from the death, is that Ed misses his right arm and left leg, and Al is no more than a soul bound to a suit of armor. Ed's missing limbs were replaced by automail, granting him the name of Full Metal Alchemist. \nThe two brothers are supported by a range of people from the military and foreign countries. As the serires is mostly plot-driven, the characters seem to fit somewhere in this plot. I have to note here that although this may reduce the versatility of each character, I believe that in real life there is not much room for this versatility anyways, as the common goal or the greater good demands certain behaviour. Luckily, the writers included some great plot twists for us. \nAnother good part of this series is that the line between good guys and bad guys is basically non-existent. It fits very well with the shows` themes on the ethcial issues from life and death choices. The 'bad guys' here are no more than the rebels with a personal story that drives them to do what they do, no more than Ed and Al. There is Scar, from the adjacent country of Ishval where a massacre took place, the Homunculi that are named after the seven sins, and royalties from the adjacent country of Xing. They all have their own goals and are willing to fight for it. \nSomehow I never like movies or series with a strong accent on the romance and I was happy to discover that FMA has some subtle, developing romances. The relationships between Ed and Winry (childhood friend of the brothers and automail expert), Al and Winry, Roy and Riza, and a few others are all exapmles of that. There's no obscenity, rather silence on the matter, but by showing their communiation (or lack of it) the relationships are naturally evolving. There is some stereotyping here (might be because it is still shounen) as both Winry and Rize are supporting their male counterpart in a similar way. It did however not disturb me and felt quite fitting with the whole of the show. \nThough somehow, towards the end, the plot seemed to drown in abstract god-like schemes, throw-over the kingdom from the insde-plans. It was a little disapointing considering all the plot twists I had endured and fairly vague. I did like the \"talking black furry ball in a glass jar\" (no spoiler here) but I still wonder where it came from. I might have to rewatch the series to see if I maybe missed a crucial line or visual somehwere. It did however made me realise that the writers mostly wanted to tell a sad but true story and created characters to tell it for them. In that case, it was very well done. \nIn general, it was a good step to widen the story line with an attack on Amestris, that intertwined with the brothers` search for the Philospher's Stone, but the few last episodes felt a bit like: how on earth do we end this in a constructive way? And that kinda failed. \nIn all this was a very compelling show. I could identify with the characters and the story itself holds a lot of difficult yet unsolved issues that reflect good thinking of the writers. \n        "},

I have given this anime a 10, because if there is one show I would want to give a friend who hasn't watched anime yet it is full metal alchemist, OG or brotherhood either one works in my opinion. The way this anime is driven and revolves around it's plot is a great middle group for those just getting into anime. This anime earns it's wide reputation for it's unbelievably well told 'journey' story for the Elric brothers. I love the adventure and the action present in this anime. Brotherhood is worth the watch, it has made an\n          \n        incredible improvement from the original anime whose storyline wasn't as phenomenal as brotherhood's was. Personally I still recommend watching the original full metal alchemist first, because it is still an amazing show and the two shows are so different that both can be watched without worrying about overlapping story information too much.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    so this is my first review after both my other reviews have been deleted so...here's a new one.\nStory:9\nThe reason I didn't rate this a 10 is because I watched the 2003 version and Brotherhood is basically the remake of it in anime version. It's basically about two brothers who lose their bodies or parts of their limbs after a botched attempt at human alchemy. So they become stronger and seek the philosopher's stone, a stone that has all the properties of alchemy (I forgot what the philosopher stone is). \nArt: 9\nThe art definitely had a reboot, specifically Edward's hair color changing, Winry's hair and eye\n          \n        color having a lighter color, and some other minor changes I don't really remember.\nSound: 8\nThe anime definitely has some of my favorite music, like the first opening, and the second and fourth ending. But overall, that's all the music that stuck to me. The rest didn't really stick to me.\nCharacter: 10\nThe characters are really well developed, I feel, especially Edward and Alphonse Elric, amd they have strong personalities, which again ties into them being well developed. Even the side characters have some depth into them, it'a not like they're just one-sided.\nEnjoyment: 10\nOh man, how I enjoyed this anime. I binge watched it in the summer and the episodes kept me hooked holy..I loved it.\nOverall:10\nI love this anime so much omg. You should definitely give it a try if you liked the manga or wish for some action, or both. This is definitely worth a watch.\nThis anime is not the number one anime in MAL for nothing."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Note: I have only seen Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and have not yet seen the original anime and the manga series nor the movies. Also this is my first ever anime review. I’ve only ever written drama reviews and constructive criticisms would be appreciated.\nFullmetal is a masterpiece of an anime. Everything about this anime is fantastic. Every character has a reason, a premise, and is memorable. The art is pleasing to the eyes. The voice acting brings the characters to life and full of emotion Every ending and theme song always got me signing in my horrible Japanese. The story is engaging, yet you will need\n          \n        tissues with every half hour 64 episode. \nNow to get in depth.  \nPlot:\n	The story follows two state alchemists named Edward Elric, aka Fullmetal, and his brother, Alphonse Elric. When they were younger their father left them with only their mother who then dies to a fatal illness. Which then leads to committing the ultimate sin/taboo of human transmutation. Human transmutation is essentially bringing someone back to life. Due to the first law of alchemy, equivalent exchange, Edward loses his arm and leg and Alphonse loses his entire body, but gets his soul bound to a suit of armor. We get to watch Ed and Al go through the journey of getting their bodies back. \nStory:\n	Brotherhood is nothing, but story. Filler doesn’t exist in the anime and it’s amazing. You never have to wait for the plot to move along. Without having to spoil anything, you will need a emotional support. This anime had me emotional through every moment. I was even crying over the villans! You feel all the sorrow and happiness every character goes through. In the end, it feels rewarding watching everything unfold and seeing how it ends.\nSound:\n       Wow did SID get a nice paycheck. All jokes aside, I loved every theme and ending song. I am someone who normal skips the openings and endings yet I found myself singing along. I personally love SID and their work and NICO Touches The Walls performing Hologram (ホログラム)  was a very nice introduction for me. Overall my favorite opening is Rain (レイン) and my favorite closing is Uso (嘘) which are both done by SID. For voice acting, I watched the dub and hearing Vic Mignogna voice Ed is always a welcoming sound. As for the rest the feeling seeping through them through every word being said made everything be very fluent.\nCharacters:\n       I hardly ever get to say a that all characters are interesting or compelling in any t.v. show yet FMA:B breaks this rule. Every character is memorable and interesting. I can name each villain, protagonist or side character with ease. You start to care for almost every human (or non-human) that speaks.When I finished the show, I felt as if a family member died. I got so close to these characters, I honestly didn’t know what to do knowing now that I wouldn’t watch another episode with these familiar faces. I know that these characters will always live in my heart and be an inspiration for as long as live.\nEnjoyment:\n        I enjoyed riding the Fullmetal coaster the entire length (see what I did there?). Yes it is quite lengthy and in the beginning I did wonder how long I would keep interest. Yet as the end grew closer and closer, I didn’t want it to end! The only problem I would see people having is crying. I, myself, am a very emotional person when it comes to anime and if you’re the same then be prepared for water works. But emotion isn’t always just sadness. Through the serious times, FMA:B still found a way to make me laugh despite myself. All around, this show is the definition of entertainment.\n         To conclude, FMA:B is a masterpiece of an anime. If it’s your first anime or if it’s your fifty-thousandth this is always a great pick. If you’re not into action anime, then FMA:B will change that for you. All in all, if you haven’t seen Fullmetal then change that. Trust me you won’t regret it."},

If a character gets shot, they're still human and they're just as weak, meaning the fights between the characters are never dull (quite the contrary) and are pretty much always based on strategy, not by how overpowered or underpowered ones alchemy or alchemy prowess is.\nThe art is amazing, to say the least. I won't delve into this one since it's purely opinion based, though I haven't heard a single person say they didn't like it's art, just putting that out there.\nThe soundtrack... I loved every single one of the songs, though the one that really stood out for me was Period. The openings and endings were all great in my opinion, though what Period got right was the essential feel of an anime, which can sometimes be a bit hard for certain anime to catch in an opening/ending.\nIt was actually that opening that ultimately got me to watch the anime. I watched \"Otaku Lyrics 401\" on youtube and it showed the various fights between the characters which got me incredibly curious, and I figured if I was so curious and hyped up, why wouldn't I just give in and watch?\nTo finish, i'd suggest you do the same.\nWatch the opening (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vx69Pe7Ncs), see all the different characters, see everything that happens between them and maybe you'll stay with the same curiosity that got me to watch it, love it and eventually got me to write all this.\nAnd don't worry, you can watch all openings and endings as you wish before watching the anime, you'll see all the characters and all their situations but it won't be from that that you'll get spoilers. You'd get more spoilers on this page's synopsis than the openings and endings.\n        "},

And it's in the Top 3, no doubt.... But I can't just ignore the initial reason I got into Anime to begin with, and that is midnight showings of FMA(The original series, that I thought was good at the time....).\nBrotherhood is similar to the first FMA series, lot of the same characters, although there a some completely new, and the premise is almost the same, the retrieval of Ed and Al's original bodies. What changes is Brotherhood follows the storyline of the manga almost perfectly,\n          \n        the main villain of the story-from the weakling Dante to the Mad almost God-like Father,  Wrath and Pride are different people, and Winry is a little more....

I never quit wanting to know who the next more powerful Homunculi would be, or if we would finally see Father, see Ed and Al's father, if the boys would get their bodies back, if Scar would ever be stopped, if Mustang would ever avenge his friend....\nThere's one thing in the series that I wish wouldn't have ever taken place, but it had to-FMA:Brotherhood ended. The ending was great, it gave closure, and the Final Battle was an all ought assault that left a piece of Central Destroyed and a body count on both sides, so it didn't disappoint, but I hate that it ended.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="Animation (Art) - 8\nSound - 6\nCharacters - 7\nStory - 7\nEnjoyment - 9\noverall - 8\ni watched the first series of FMA at least 4 times through, Brotherhood (BH) twice.\nANIMATION - the \"quality\" of animation in BH was fairly superior. they put more effort, time and money on it. they used better techniques, the coloring was very nicely done, the movements were far better, the shadows, the perspectives and pretty much everything...\nexcept for \"style\"! i dare say the style they choose was very unfitting. shiny colors, bright polished skins and faces and so on. such style does fit an anime like Soul Eater rather good, but not\n          \n        FMA.\nthe style of the first series was exactly what FMA needed, \"a master's touch\" you could say - dull non shiny colors, sometimes with weak fading shadows, which gave a sad impression to the whole thing.\nSOUND - it's funny that after all these years the weakest joint of every japanese anime is it's sound effects! movements, background voice, sometime characters' voices... . with some rather simple and easy work they would've made this series more enjoyable in all ways. FMA 1 was really good in terms of background \"music\", way better than BH. but in other aspects they were the same.\nthe japanese voice actors were better this time - the english voices were better in the first series.\nCHARACTERS - such a rich story needs obviously many characters and of course at least a handful main ones. in the first series this was taken care of in a good way, the important characters were easily distinguishable, the way that one would easily remember them even after years. be it their physical appearance, their mentality or simply their position.\nin BH it's a little too crowded. everywhere the brothers go and whatever they do, a bunch of guys just get involved with the story, now you can't just have them in the story out of the blue and with no roots. so the story has to spend some time explaining a little about each one of these characters. with limited numbers of episodes this makes the viewer loose the main line.\nthe obvious example was the very main character, Edward. his role in FMA 1, his aura and his character were really great, you could see an adult who's still a child and understand him and accept him that way. in BH he just appears as a child. he's no hero anymore, he's just good enough!\nthe worst part is, as it seems to have become a tradition in anime, the ending, where pretty much \"every single\" big and small character should be seen and get involved, just in the last arc (i was shocked when that didn't in gintama)! that like half of the homunculus die in only one last arc or that a lot of important things happen make these appearances just more confusing and illogical.\nSTORY - the first series was truly and thoroughly a great work, in terms of the story and how this story is being told, the characters and in general the whole atmosphere of the anime.\nthe strength of the whole story lies in the simple fact that the main idea is easily understandable and so near: we have 2 young brothers, who've lost their mother, while their father is gone. they're ready to do whatever they can to bring her back, be it breaking taboos (a resolve that anyone would come to).\nnow taking advantage of this strong point would only seem natural, as it's been done in the first series very nicely. the very good timed flash backs, the memories and the order these are being shown make the viewer to feel empathy with these rather fragile naive boys, like the simply perfect mother, hate that irresponsible father, despise that Tucker guy (who made a chimera out of his daughter) and so on. at the same time their powers, their guts and their devotion makes you like them even more. especially that a good taste of humor is mixed in. the problem with the first series was obviously that it was created too soon. so it didn't take too long before the story went ballistic! non matching characters, unneeded action and a rather weak added-story with an especially weak ending.\nin BH the flow of the story was steady and good, for it followed the manga. the later characters were better matched together and to the story, there was more logic to the story, the actions, the scenes and the plot were nice and smooth. but this time they went too far in some other aspects. too much humor for a rather serious story, unclear history of some characters, especially the brothers and again a rather weak ending. there were fewer meaningful flash backs, the story didn't seemed really continuous and they were times that some main characters wouldn't show up for several episodes.\nENJOYMENT - FMA BH was indeed an enjoyable anime, one that every one should watch, but still it's not good enough to stop one from watching FMA 1. strong story, great animation quality, good characters and a production of high quality are enough to please any viewer. it would leave the viewer with great memories, that will remain with them for a long time.\nas a friend once said, FMA tastes damn good!\n        "},

After watching the first one ‘Fullmetal Alchemist’, it was good but it did not prepare me for this one which is so much better. I mean it even made me give my first review ever.\nThe Story is so good. After watching FMA I was really excited by FMA Brotherhood. But it was even better than I imagined. There were no unnecessary parts of the story. No time was wasted on insanely detailed explanations which are not necessary, like must shounen. They spend so long explaining what the\n          \n        kind of assault will be used and all the effects. I mean here the were using alchemy to fight and that was it. The story did not focus on romance which I am grateful for. Most anime and movies in general always add that extra annoying bit of romance to take the story of what is happening.The story revolved around themes that I enjoyed. I really liked the friendship theme. I mean there doesn't have to be that special girl/guy for anyone to function.\nThe Characters were great. I mean they did not fall into all the cliché ‘good’ guy ‘bad’ guy category. By the end of the series you feel like you have gotten to know the characters.  It was really good. I like the way the characters are real like if you were in that situation you would have done something similar. I was very good. At the end of each episode you know the characters a bit more. The supporting characters were given life which some animes fail to do. The only aspect that is sometimes shown of a supporting character is in relation to what the main is doing. like guy that helped main character x to thing y. and that is all making it easy for you to forget who the supporting characters are a few minutes down the line.\nThe Art was really detailed the lighting was not gloomy at some parts. You could see a silhouette of one of the characters and known who it was.\nThe Sound was great. The best kind of sounds during an anime is the kind which you do not notice the song because it comes at the right time where you would like to hear it. The OP and ED were usually nice I don’t like the too frequent changes. I enjoyed the first and last OP the most.\nAnyone in their right mind would enjoy this series.  The mix on genre without going to the extremes is done so well. You see genres like action, adventure, shounen, drama, comedy and tragedy (I know at the same time, some parts are completely funny while others kind of serious) and just a tinge of romance. I was very whole some. It was not boring at any single point.\nI would give this a perfect 10 overall. And I am very stingy about grades. Whichever way you stumbled on this you should finish reading this and begin watching it. And no, it’s not too long for those of you that like short 25 episode animes."},

Say you were placed in a position where your family structure was ravished, and did one of the worst things possible the the one you hold dear? \nIf you answered become a dog of the army, then I welcome you to second attempt at an anime adaption of Hiromu Arakawa's manga Fullmetal Alchemist, the brilliant Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.\nThe anime ran from 2009-2010 so its a rather fresh one on the scene in terms of that which is to be titled \"classic.\" Directed by Yasuhiro Irie and adapted for the screen  by Hiroshi Ōnogi, this is definitely something to take\n          \n        off your never-endingly growing list of suggestions and to take on immediately as your next  marathon.\nThere are a total of 64 episodes so get ready. This is about to be a journey, which unlike the unceasing longer anime, where the filler is a frequent as story; will be uninterrupted by episodes which make machette qielding maniacs go on reaping sprees in your local corn fields.\nFor those who don't like corn, imagine wheat.\nThe story is one of a classic. The quest for the redemption and more. Thought in many ways this show is all too unique on this point. The twists keep popping up, but not in the manner which makes one feel like wanting to hear Vogon poetry. They are honestly flowing with the story, and do not feel like they are there for the sake of merely extending this story to the point that you forgot how it even started. Within the borders of the genre it is an honestly encapsulating story, and beyond the base structure true genius. The detail that Arakawa went to in terms of some of the theory to the world itself is uncanny at points. For this an more, the story would be insulted to its very core to receive less than a 10/10\nAs for the characters, little is to be said. They have amusing traits. Endearing traits. You can connect with them, despite the fact they exist in a world so different from our own, and you honestly care what happens to them. It has everything that a character should, and so receives a thorough 9/10\nThe art and sound however I have little to say about. Neither good nor bad. There is nothing all to noteworthy about it, and this is what makes it so special. The most important factor to this piece above is the story it bears, and not its visual play. By not overbearing the story, nor detracting from it the art and sound truly do their roles. Earning them a solid 7/10 and 8/10 respectively.\nTo those at home who’ve bore with my review as above which is lie more than a rant on how much I’ve appreciation for the given story of this anime, and how much I enjoyed it; I’ve but three words. Just watch it. There is no maybes in the world of indifference. If you merely throw it on the exponentially expanding “to watch” list, it will become lost and perhaps even never seen.\nCommit yourselves to a show that’s to be a true marathon tempter, it got me.\nOverall I’d love to give it more than a 9/10, however 10/10 implies perfection for a complete mark. This anime is far from perfect, there are times for example, when the pacing, especially in the last two seasons got on my nerves. However I wouldn’t be preaching if I hadn’t enjoyed it so. Give the anime your time, and in my opinion, if you’ve not seen it yet, you’ll wonder how you hadn’t.\n        "},

Break things down and rebuild it into sometime more awesome?\nWell, the story revolves around 2 young boys. They aren't your regular joes, they are alchemists. \"An alchemist can be defined as a profession/person that practices alchemy which is the quest of searching for a way in which to turn copper and other metals into gold.\" Wait. They aren't just regular alchemists.. that would be boring. They got their nickname, Fullmetal Alchemist for a reason.\nEdward(older brother) and his younger brother, Alphonse are missing some parts. Edward missing one hand, a leg and Alphonse missing his\n          \n        whole body!\nEdward replaces them with mechanical limbs while Alphonse's soul is controlling a suit of armor.\nSo the two goes on this crazy adventures battling bad guys. I don't want to ruin it for ya, of course.\nStory: It's a really good written story. Unique and have a strong base.\nArt: The battle scene are really well drawn.\nSound: Are pretty good.\nCharacter: The characters were developed quite good, each with different attitudes and views. \nEnjoyment: Well I never got bored, and it does catches you by your mouth, making you want more.\nOverall: Story - 8, Art - 8, Sound - 7, Character - 8, Enjoyment - 9.\nA grand total of 8/10.\nI would recommend this, if you're into a bit of humor, action and tiny speck of romance.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This is my first review, so please consider that when reading this.\nThis is, by far, the best anime I have seen to date.\nFullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was the first anime I watched.  I had not watched the original, and still haven't come round to it yet, but Brotherhood was all I needed.  I highly enjoyed this anime from start to finish, and there were very few elements of it I disliked.\nThe first thing that grabbed me was the humorous elements to the story.  Not a lot of people I know like this as such, but I believe that a little bit of comedic\n          \n        value makes the storyline fun and interesting.  \nThe second thing was the characters. Edward, the short tempered little runt, has a very unique character to him, which is what I fell in love with at first.  And then you have Alphonse, the more sensible of the siblings, with a sweet and loving personality - and then Roy Mustang, the confident Colonel with an ambition to become the Fuhrer.  Each one of these anime characters has a unique personality; provoking emotions towards them, which just shows how well made the characters are.\nThe third was the awesome storyline.  It starts off funny and then gradually gets serious as it progresses, and the twists and turns in the storyline which surprise you and make you want to watch even more.  Every element of the storyline I love.\nThe fourth was the art.  The art is clean and detailed, and my favourite part of it is the detail in the battle scenes.  Never have I been so impressed.  Brilliant.\nThe only thing I marked down on this one was the sound, however I did give it a high score of a 9.  This was only because the OST tracks further on in the anime were a little repetitive.  Nevertheless, the music enhances the anime, especially some of the music during the epic battles.  Also, the openings and endings are great.  But that is only my opinion.  Some people like, some people don't like.  It is different for every person.\nI'll say it again, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the best shounen anime I have watched.  Watch it, you won't be disappointed."},

Since the homunculi in this anime are based on the Seven Deadly Sins, they are able to portray what makes a human a man. \n\nAnimation \n 9.5/10\nVery good animation. The scenes work perfectly with the story line and it's\n          \n        wonderful to watch. \nAlso the graphics and art work are much better than the manga (which you usually find in all shonen mangas). \nIt's fun to watch and most moments are jaw-dropping.\nSound \n 9.5/10\nSuits the mood and scenes perfectly. There are different background musics that are played repeatedly at different moments but all that works well together.\nCharacters \n 9.5/10\nVery original, though a few characters are unnecessary. \nThe characters were designed to the role they would play in the anime and though sometimes there are too many of them, they always come back to help with the plot one way or the other.\nOverall \n 9/10\nI liked that the story was able to express and evoke so many emotions and reflect on sins and desires of being human. \nVery strong and makes you think differently after you watch it.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Fullmetal Alchemist is just overall, a must-see classic. Everything is just utterly phenomenal. The story is brilliant, and the characters are extremely well thought out. When you first see this anime, it's a bit confusing. You kind of have an idea, but not really. When you really see the story unfold, it's just tragic and beautiful. Edward and Alphonse's relationship is honestly just inspiring and heartbreaking. You will not regret seeing this anime. For the soundtrack- It is amazing! They did a really good job on it. The artwork did seem a bit cartoon-y for me at first, only because I was probably used to\n          \n        seeing the original. \n Please note when your watching this, it goes extremely fast. They pretty much created this with the thought that everyone watched the original first. If you want a slowed down beginning, the first one is the one you want. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    After having watched the first anime adaption of Fullmetal Alchemist, I couldn't help feeling a sense of disappointment at the ending. It didn't follow the manga's ending, and it showed with a poor performance. In this redone version of the manga, the anime faithfully follows its counterpart and makes for a great show.\nStory: 9\nThe story is great, but for me personally, the whole \"super power\" aspect of the anime almost feels a little overdone, as if I'd seen it already in many other shows. Even with this little hiccup, I still feel as though the story deserves praise for its complexities and plot twists.\nArt: 9\nThe\n          \n        artwork is very solid throughout the entire anime, but doesn't really do anything innovative or exciting to deserve a 10. The character models are solid, the uniforms of the soldiers are done well, and the locations and environments are good.\nSound: 10\nI'm not one to usually ever praise English audio over its Japanese counterpart, but this anime has (in my opinion) superior English voice actors. The voice actors really put emotion into their characters, especially Vic. The only problem I have is that Alphonse's voice actor from the original hit puberty and couldn't do a repeat, so they had to bring in someone new who I think didn't do quite as good a job. But suffice to say that the voice acting is superb. The sound effects are also outstanding, especially when alchemy is being performed.\nCharacter: 9\nWhat I really like about this anime is that the multitude of characters introduced throughout the show are handled very appropriately. Supporting characters get their back stories explained thoroughly (for the most part), and the Elric brothers get the spotlight you'd expect the main characters to get.\nEnjoyment: 9\nWhen I feel like I have to watch the next episode right away, I know that the series is great. For me, I give a 10 in enjoyment when after I finish a series, I feel profoundly blown away. I didn't get that feeling after watching FMA, but that \"edge on your seat\" feeling was constantly there.\nOverall: 9\nHow many anime can you REALLY give a 10? There aren't many, because anime masterpieces should totally blow your mind after you finish them. FMA is a great anime, but not a masterpiece. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    So the most popular, \"Number One\"-Anime on this site can't possibly be bad, right? Well fear not, this is not meant to be contrarian or going against the masses for the sake of being cool or simply different, no. I can wholeheartedly support the notion that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is nothing short of a fantastic show. Really, the only goal this review has, for me personally, is to find out whether it's really great or even a masterpiece. You see, since i always make up these reviews as i go, i am not really sure myself ate the start. But let's take a look:\nStory: The\n          \n        story is outstanding, let me get this out of the way first. It's such a carefully crafted plot, with all the foreshadowing that a story of this kind carries around. However, it is always a little subtle, so that you can only really spot it on a rewatch. That said, the story is also rather straightforward, it's nothing to crazy or outlandish, all the concepts seem to be grounded in this world, that's not that different from ours, except that some people are capable of using a kind of magic called \"Alchemy\". It gets a little crazy towards the end, but even that is always established throughout the show, always in the back of the head of the Elric Brothers and the viewer. It deals with some heavy themes, the loss of loved ones, the desperate desire to bring them back, the punishment for ones naive sins and how to deal with it, how to bear it or maybe fight it and to protect the people that still remain. Also, to bring it down the basics: what it means to be human. While it has some truly tragic scenes, enough to make you shed some tears, certainly, there is also just a lot of fun. Really,the story is able to invoke the whole range of emotions, something that is always tough, or even nigh impossible, to do.\nArt: Something the art in this show really manages to capture is facial expressions, especially for Edward. When his eyes go wide because he saw something horrible or if he is angry, simply by being called out on his height, the drawings always capture his emotions perfectly. But the same goes for other characters, Roy Mustang, Armstrong and Hohenheim and even Alphonse,fascinating enough. He doesn't even have a face, but just the way his eyes get smaller or just completely go dark, you always get a idea how he might feel in a moment. I gotta say though, not a huge fan of the art style. It looks nice, certainly, it's still pretty good, but it's just a little too basic to me. It' kinda hard to express what i mean, but i just really like stuff that goes a little off the rails. In contrast to that, FMA:B goes a more realistic route and that is okay, it's something a can like, but not completely love. Some of the character designs are a little silly, mostly in the Homunculus-department, but then some are absolutely brilliant, even if a huge chunk of the characters wear the same uniform. Not that this is a problem, the blue looks pretty sharp. So the art is overall very good, even if it seemed like i had a lot of qualms with it. I didn't, i blew it out of proportion, just a tad.\nSound: Something that really stands out here is the voice acting, that is some real quality. Romi Park does such an amazing job as the lead role and she is pretty much the whole reason i could never watch this show dubbed, even if always hear good things about the english voice work. I mention her specifically, but the whole cast is actually amazing, without fail really. Then again, i don't actually know japanese, so it's hard for me to spot a bad actor, i suppose. To my amateur-ears, it all sounded great. And then there is the habit of some great Ending-transitions. They are so memorable and always so brilliantly timed that they really make for the best scenes. Especially the door-scene, that might be my favorite in the whole show. The Soundtrack is nice as well, especially the main theme, always brings a tear to my eye. I just wouldn't listen to it separately. There are also a lot of openings and endings and they all range from pretty good to great. My personal favorite might still be the first opening, but over the rewatch i also grew fond of \"Golden Time Lover\". The sound receives a final verdict of great.\nCharacters: This section, in tandem with the story might be the best part of the show. The main characters are great, the side characters too, the villains as well, i guess you can see where this is going. They all have their struggles and motivations, even if for some the motivation is simply:\"Father says so.\" Even that works, simply because the cast is so massive that you really get all kinds of characters. At the same time, however, the how manages to avoid all the common tropes. Yes, Edward is a bit of a hotheaded shonen-protagonist, but at the same time, he is a straight-up genius, levelheaded as soon as he actually enters the fight his short temper brought him into. They are many examples of that, but that's something everyone should discover for themselves, how much there actually is to the characters. Just want to say that you won't find your twintail-tsundere or your dandere with some shade of blue in her hair. Not to say that i don't enjoy these archetypes, but if your fed up with more of the same, Brotherhood delivers something different. That alone wouldn't be enough for outstanding Characters, but again, i won't say too much, only that there is a lot of depth and development.   \nEnjoyment: In 64 Episodes, i was never bored or had the urge to check the time on an episode. That is truly amazing, some regular 12 episode anime don't manage that. So what else could i say to prove my enjoyment? That the adventures of the Fullmetal Alchemist Alphonse Elric and his little assistant threw me through all the emotions i already mentioned. The pacing is always perfect too and the payoff for some of the slower segments is outstanding. So this will be the score for my enjoyment, i loved it, not every episode, but i at least liked them all.\nSo in the end, it only barely misses the ten and i think that's okay. Fullmetal Alchemist is something anyone can enjoy and i wouldn't judge you if you said it's your favorite anime of all time. For me, however, it's a little too grounded. I mentioned this before, but i prefer something a teeny bit more complicated. Really, only a small margin, cause this show is pretty complex too. Does it help if i mention that my favorite anime is either Monogatari or Madoka? Yeah, i am one of those people... . But there you have it, a great anime with pretty much everything you cold ever want, stellar animation, a good story with a nice ending and a whole bunch of likeable and complex characters. This is why we watch anime, right? I certainly do.       "},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\nReview In short, Let me keep it real. This anime isn't worth your time there you go.\nI have Dropped this series for many reasons alone that I did to where I was watching at and its pretty simple why that is and why It makes sense for me to review full metal alhemist desu ga. Firstly I base this series on the analogy of 2 words that continues to irk at my own viewing experience of watching this for a long while now.\nThose 2 words would be Annoying Tendency!\nNot only just that, This anime has dragged onto the point where I know longer care where\n          \n        this story is heading because unfortunately its writer, likes to Time waste way too often.\nAnd now the fans have overate this to the point where literally the story has not changed or mature with its premise as its still follows the same freaking formula of repetitive shonen nonsense of its character troupes with most episodes from 1 to god knows what episode its currently on right now and with the exception of thinking that this is a pirate adventure which is totally dumb as hell and has lost credibility in claiming that this is about pirates.\nJust like the Naruto series lost credibility thinking its own series projects ninjas in its own show and just as similar as that is to full metal alhemist desu ga its those flaws that just keeps continuing on and on.\nits like the equivalent of that bad TV series Lost but on crack with many bad implants to its female characters which I mean Lots.\nReading its Guinness book of its trash manga doesn't even help or even give me value for reading through it as it has loads of the same reasons of problems as I've mentioned above.\nIf that wasn't enough of an issue. Its story of its characters and its events always end up being a very similar Forced Melodramatic story writing that you have seen and heard loads of times which in turn only forces you to endure this along with bad side stories that contribute into an even slower pace for this show in its build up with each Arc  of episodes later by then it becomes unacceptable!\nFrom each arc to arc for me did not guarantee any love or charm what so ever to lots of its characters like the time you are first introduce to them in the series upon viewing.\nInstead it only just copies and paste stuff mostly of the same scenarios that you would see far too often in this series for most of these characters along with their progression except for some few that show to get more abilities than others really makes it fair in its togetherness doesn't it?\nSome bonding that is if there are only certain characters that can do certain things most others couldn't do even when uniting the strawhats together it only makes it for a more cheesy affair than ever most of the time when you would obviously expect it, Especially when it comes off as cliche as it does.\nWhich also regards to parts where full metal alhemist desu ga wants to go dark and its so desperate to up the ante but only to result into a similar conclusion like before.\nI mean come on its way past most of the amount of standard shonen episodes! which reminds me of Detective Conan, However in Conan's case the Difference is between these 2 series is in its Fandoms. full metal alhemist desu ga fans try to Overhype the crap out of this which is really unnecessary even when lots of people know clearly that it is the case.\nWe already got the basic gist of things of this series from the beginning, Even through its world setting up and till now is still not even well structured since it throws random places for us to be distracted so that fillers can help maintain its bad pace let alone does it even make that much sense to begin with especially when trying to use foreshadowing to justify the ridiculous amount of episodes that is in this series as it is to make us feel like we have feel invested in the unknown mysteries of the show which actually does the opposite effect.\nI believe the full metal alhemist desu ga fandom have gotten mixed up with what world building actually is with the amount of episodes there have been especially focusing on stuff that this show thinks I should see but I don't and no I don't need to have to skip arcs just to enjoy something, Why should I? that is just retarded. Is that why its Manga counterpart is in the Guinness book of records because of its pacing and complacency? Makes sense for whatever parts of this series gains popularity in much of its story for being pointlessly repetitive i suppose.\n1. First off regarding what I've mentioned so far,\nIf you have an immersive world and there is already enough content in the story/journey in your world building never mind how vast or mysterious it is, Don't pointlessly drag it out instead USE IT! and stop milking it with stupid character expressions of coincidences full of plot devices and plot armour, I do not care that it is a dumb shonen. At least FMA knew this a lot better.\n2. Pointless prologues to your episodes.\n3. Bad morals in many different situations of the story with its writing.\n4. Stupid journey objectives that hardly revolves around the plot of the treasure of full metal alhemist desu ga until twelve of episodes later on to the point which is unacceptable along with milking its main characters most of the time of this franchise that gets to the point where it feels like its turning into filler which by the way there are a lot of them no matter what fans try to say against this.\n5. Stop foreshadowing something in the story that was mentioned  its not good story telling neither is it clever in any way since it never justifies its consitency for constantly dragging on in the way it does.\n6. Over hyping stronger characters that don't really get involve in the story that much anyway.\n7. Most of the times bad animation no doubt\n8. its voice acting well its just mostly tedious and over the place nothing great or over the top despite how he writes the story (Bad writing Btw) that even after listening to lot of these characters it just makes me want to listen to a dying mule instead. Nothing weird or wonderful about that my friends.\nWith all that being said, Its only qualities that I like about full metal alhemist desu ga are the art designs of certain characters and the fact there is a series that stars pirates, since there are very few anime series that have pirates (not that they are suppose to be role models in any way)\nbut those are the only positives with this series in general for me and honestly nothing more.\nOverall its an over exaggerated series of repetitive outcomes that I have not enjoyed in its long run about dumb wannabe pirates quote PIRATES! It's only real positive here is HEY ITS ABOUT SWAG WOW THATS RARE TO FIND IN ANIME ISN'T IT???..WRONG BECAUSE CONSIDERING WHAT good ARE LIKE IN REAL LIFE WHO CARES ANYWAYS. Thats like me wanting to write a story about slavery on different Ethnicity/Races but NOOOO.. that won't be right so why not glorify slave traders into being these nice dumb heroes because you know? It's fiction and it sounds interesting right? RIGHT??... AGAIN WRONG.\nNow going back to my point of Watching this crappy cartoon this only makes me or most viewers seem to have to glorify such a pathetic outlook of a premise with its stretched out world building that is not even incisive enough to its history of the story, neither is it memorable for me enough to even care about it to watch it any longer as it doesn't reward me growth in their characters, a decisive objective or consistency of its so called journey within its story in general.\nLast but not least The Comedy really suck! seriously do yourselves a Big favour there are better Shonens and many other Animes out there that is worth watching that has better characters, better story, better pace and better growth than this long turd of a show that seems to overate a lot in Japan above others which unfortunately is the world we live in tHey. Consider this dropped and good riddance.\nExcuse me for being honestly critical as I am, I do not sugar coat a series if thats what you really wanted about this show in general, well too bad. You can go to other reviewers that are giving a ten towards this Overrated piece of fiction that's overstayed it's welcome.\nTo all of you who have read my review thanks for taking the time and take care.\nFMA still superior than these one\n        "},

The art is not typical for anime and suits the show very well, giving it distinctive style (more for both the various characters than the settings). Characters are a lot more recognizable as a result. Also the different races that are included look different, beyond simply their skin tone.\nSound 9/10\nVery good musical score, which not only gets the big moments right but\n          \n        also the more low key moments. The opening and ending themes are also great and you can listen to the music on its own.\nCharacter 10/10\nWide range of very well developed characters, both the main characters but also the secondary characters and the villains. Many times I found that when a character started to get more screen time, they quickly became my favorite.\nStory 11/10\nThis here is the reason that this series is one of my all time favorites (and this is not limited to anime). The story is totally unpredictable, attention grabbing and extremely well presented. The pacing is perfect and events occur in a very natural way with a marvelous conclusion.\nAlso, magical system of alchemy that is presented in the show, is very consistent in that it does not break its own rules; this is not a show where the main character becomes the strongest for no reason other than being the main character.\nEnjoyment 11/10\nThis show is one hell of a ride. Slow to begin, especially for those that watched the first series, but it surpasses that in every way. A must watch for everybody, and not just anime fans.\nOverall 10/10"},

It's a satisfying series which manages to stay engaging throughout its 64 episode run.\nBut why do you have to watch FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood? \nYou have to watch it cause it's just PERFECT, even for that people who are not a lot into the anime world.\n          \n        You're going to love every part of the story, trust me! (I've almost cried at the end, when Edward came back home with Alphonse.)\nThis anime has got many terrific parts with a great animation and an excellent sound (I LOVE THE 4TH OP, IT'S WOW). Characters are all distinct, fully-formed and convincing: you will love all of them (even that people you would initially think are \"naughty\"). The story is brilliant, and it makes you more and more attracted to the world of alchemy. It begins in a relatively small way with the Elric's travel (I'm not going to tell you the reason of the trip, cause it would be a big spoiler lol) and expands into something magnificent I will not go into.  \nI'm not a true fan of anime and manga, but Hiromu Arakawa's work is one of several which have to be seen.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Fma....Brotherhood. The name  gave many fans of Ed and his brother Al's adventure new hope of seeing them demolish homoncolous again. What's the difference about this adventure? Let's just say, what's not? This series is not a remake or continuation of the original fma, but rather a better adaptation of the hit manga. The original series is known for not following the manga to the tee but instead showing us another story as a whole. This is because the original was running while the manga was still being made and therefore took another route once it caught up to the manga. Many didn't mind\n          \n        this because the anime was still good. But the creators did. They wanted make an anime adaptation of the manga which in essence they did not do. So they created brotherhood with the hope of equaling or even surpassing the original.  But they did more than that. They made the original an afterthought. \nOpening and Ending Themes:\nThe original fma had great opening and endings, but none really stood out except for The famous song rewrite by Asian Kung Fu generation. Brotherhood came in wanting to fix that problem. But they did more than that. Yes, brotherhood set the bar for anime everywhere with every single opening being a big hit and with every ending being able finish the days episode with the people watching wanting more. Rate:10\nCharacter and character development:\nEVEN though I feel as though writing anything on something everyone knows fma is known for, I'll write this for those who don't know. Fma IS character development. It's what makes the show good. Whether it be Ed learning just how much he cares for his father, or Al learning that he is not something made up by his brother, brotherhood manages to make character development absolutely necessary in the anime because without it, it wouldn't be nowhere near as good. Rate:10\nStory:\nThe manga for this anime is known for having one of the best stories ever. So if this show follows the manga by the thread what do you think the story should be rated? Does Chuck Norris have a beard in his chin? I'm pretty sure you get the point. Rate:10\nArt:\nAlthough I have never been a fan of this particular type of artwork, the artist manages to make it almost an afterthought while watching. The artwork is fluent and very lifelike, and it manages to catch the watchers fancy by mixing in with the story so well. Rate:9\nOVERALL: 9\nWhy a 9? Because nomatter how you look at it all tens and one nine will never make a ten. But nonetheless,  a flawless anime that will last for the ages."},

Seriously, go watch it, it really is that good and is one of the few anime's that reached it's level of hype. From FMA's story, characters, artwork, sound, everything and I mean everything is really top notch and damn near perfect. The voice acting is excellent and has an A-list cast, the art looks crisp and beautiful, the action is just amazing, the story has such a large scope and the ending just ties everything up so nicely.\nI won't go too much into the story, but the basic\n          \n        premise is that our main heroes are trying to get their bodies back. That does not sound like much, but the story goes so much deeper and explores various philosophical and moral issues about war, human sacrifice, and what it means to be human. FMA's story is just something I can't describe well enough to do it justice. So if you want to know more you'll just have to watch the anime!\nThe art and sound are both excellent and accompany the anime well. It's pretty much what you expect from a top notch anime. The voice acting is, well perfect.\nThe characters are all like able, even the villains. The development of the main characters and side characters are all there. It's like a dream come true how much development these characters get. We actually, over the course of the anime, get to know and learn about these characters. From their flaws to there ideals. That's what I miss from a lot of anime because of the episode limitations character development is really the first thing that is lacking in a 12 or 13 episode anime. But with 64 episodes, there is plenty of time for development of both villains and heroes. And the most important thing is that the characters are human, they're not perfect, they have their flaws and that's what makes them like able and so good. \nFMA: Brotherhood is truly a masterpiece, everything that makes up FMA is what any anime fan would dream of. In other words it's perfect. No fillers. No dumb comic relief characters. No fluff. So what are you still doing reading my review! Go watch FMA: Brotherhood now! In fact I think i'll watch it again. \n10/10 in every regard. \n        "},

Sacrifices are necessary; you can't gain anything without losing something first. Although, if you can endure that pain, and walk away from it, you'll find that you now have a heart strong enough to overcome any obstacle. Yeah...a heart made Fullmetal.\"\nWhen FMA came on to the screen in 2003, anime fans went nuts over the likable characters, well-done humor, and overall engaging story-telling. However, some fans criticized the show for not being true to the source material. Personally, I was satisfied with how the show ended, and since then it became one of\n          \n        my top 5 animes of all time. Fast forward to 2009, where we now have the release of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, an adaptation that is truer to the source material. Does Brotherhood make up for the faults of the original series? Yes...and No.\nTechnically speaking, Brotherhood truly is a visual marvel. Studio Bones is probably the best animation company in the anime industry. This is true with FMA (2003), Soul Eater, Wolf's Rain, OHSHC, and with Brotherhood as well. Colors are vivid, backgrounds are detailed, and overall art direction is superb. Definitely watch this show on a HDTV. Sound, however, falls a little flat for me. Granted, I think the OPs and EDs of Brotherhood are definitely a step up from the 2003 anime, but then there's the score to Brotherhood. It's certainly not a bad score, but it's not as memorable as the 2003 anime score. The 2003 anime score carried emotional weight whereas the Brotherhood score I feel doesn't leave that much of an impact. That's not to say it's bad, in fact, it's very good. However, a score is great when it gives me goosebumps, sets the tone for what's to come, and I don't feel that with the Brotherhood score. Voice acting is just awesome as you expect. Both Vic Mignogna and Romi Paku both return to Edward, a role that both of them are known the most for. In fact, most of the voices actors from the 2003 anime, both dub and sub have returned, but there are stand-ins for those who couldn't return. For example, Aaron Dismuke couldn't reprise his role of Alphonse due to puberty, however, his replacement Maxey Whithead does an amazing job in the role. Plus, Aaron does makes a cameo so watch out for that. Overall, voice work is excellent in both languages so personal preference what it will come down to.\nFMA as a whole is just beautiful. As you watch the show you believe the these characters and their relationships with one another. You believe that these two Brothers want to get their bodies back. Edward, while very-short tempered, knows what his priority is and tries his best to be the best older brother a person could have. Alphonse, while in someway may be the weak one, is really the one who is stronger of the two becoming the voice of reason in situations. Then there are the side characters such as the serious yet cocky Col. Roy Mustang, and Winry, a girl that while on outside looks likes your shoe-in love interest, is really inside a tough strong female character. There are so many other characters I could tell you about like Scar and Riza Hawkeye, but if I told you then we would be here all day. Hell, FMA even has likable villains. There is no character I hate in FMA, not a single one. However, Brotherhood's narrative while great suffers from many flaws.\nFirst of all, this could be just me, but compared the 2003 anime, which also had comedy, Brotherhood is very goofy. Meaning, throughout the series, there were a lot of moments of humor that just didn't fit right. It's not that I don't like the humor, but it's with this humor in Brotherhood that I feel that it is more of a straight up comedy. I do laugh when there is humor but for me it ruins the flow of certain scenes of intensity. I say if you want to do comedy then do it at a time where it is appropriate.\nComedy aside, Brotherhood's real problem comes from one simple fact: it's very cliched writing. Don't get me wrong, story-wise, I do find it superior to the original in that it resolves certain characters by the end. Although, the resolution is plagued by so many things we have seen before and many things you see coming. I won't spoil the ending for you, but the end is shall I say...silly. It's a totally justified ending and reasonable ending, but it's the actions of the main bad guy that really tick me off. It's not that he is bad at being a bad guy, but rather, he's the bad guy that we have all seen before. He doesn't do anything new nor bring anything special to the table. We know what he will do and we know how this is going to end. I know that I'm making this more of a comparison as opposed to an actual review, but once again, the 2003 ended in a way that made it felt unexpected. In Brotherhood, I knew what was coming. This doesn't make it necessarily bad writing, just semi-lazy writing. Then comes another flaw in the resolution, that while steps up the cliche writing, feels a little bit too complex for this show to begin with. Luckily, it's one of those head scratchers that even if you don't understand it, you can still just go with it.\nI think Brotherhood while a excellent adaptation of the source material, still has some problems with it that prevent it from being 10 out of 10 material for me. However, I really enjoyed Brotherhood, nonetheless. While I do believe that the first anime is significantly better as a stand-alone, Brotherhood is still a very faithful adaptation. If anything, here's my order of how you should go about this: first, go watch the 2003 anime and movie, and then watch Brotherhood. Seriously, if you are an anime fan who hasn't gotten around to this franchise yet, then I highly recommend you check it out immediately.\n        "},

Censors, fillers, etc; they get what we love and in one too many occasions ruin it.\nThis is definitely not one of those cases. In fact, its the exact opposite. Following the criteria of \"if it isn't broken, don't fix it\", Bones Studios gets the flawless FMA manga and delivers us a nearly perfect adaptation, following the manga closely with very few deviations. \nFluid animation makes the already intense battles just so much more impactful.\nThe characters are imperfect and relatable, each have their different\n          \n        motive for doing what they do and it's not just to move forward the plot. You want to understand the characters, and you are invited to do just so.\nThe story is as intriguing as in the manga, and the conclusion to the series is just damn well beautiful.\nNo matter what genres you prefer, this series is a must watch.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Initially I have to make it clear a to few people out there that FMA Brotherhood is not the same/continuation of the series. It's a completely different story (putting aside character similarities and maybe the initial few episodes). Brotherhood is thoroughly adapted from the manga whereas the initial series diverted from the manga story line after a few episodes.\nAnd to sum it up it is one of \"the\" best anime out there and is definitely a must watch for everybody who loves anime. But writing just that would not be doing justice to the series, so moving on...\nI would say that the initial pacing was\n          \n        a bit rushed, which seemed like they were trying to skip over the parts that were shown in FMA. This might have been looked upon as bad move but then it seems to be justifiable since they didn't want to send a message to the viewers that the series was exactly the same as before. The only drawback this had (the initial pacing) in my opinion was the lack of emotion and attachment to certain characters in the beginning, which was there in the first anime. The story's pace became normal from episode 10 or so and it managed to tell the story with little or no confusion at all.\nThe plot is one of the best I've seen in a very long time with cleverly built up twists and turns everywhere. It is one of those series you could say was planned from bottom to top and unlike a lot of other anime's out there, it tied all the loose threads perfectly giving you a wonderful wholesome picture of the story at the end.\nThe characters were portrayed very well and with appropriate depth so that by the end of the series you may feel attached to the people in it. Everyone had a rich story on their side and motives that drive them which meant that there are very few people you would come to dislike, unless the story demands it of course. There are also plenty of new characters that provide further depth to the series. The older characters like Mustang, Scar and Wrath are even more awesome and have been portrayed much more detailed than before.\nThe animation and voice acting are very well done and it does justice to the scenes portrayed. The art as a matter of fact is more detailed and portrays the characters in much better shade than earlier. Action scenes are brilliantly choreographed and most if all the Opening, Ending songs are awesome. The Background Music if any are used appropriately and is not overused at all (in the sense that, it is not used to give emotions to scenes when its just not there). \nOverall this is one anime tuned to perfection! And I repeat the fact that to sum it up its one of the best anime out there and everyone should definitely give it a go! 10/10\n        "},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    This is the first time I actually feel like writing a review, and I’m very much aware that I won’t be saying anything that it hasn’t been said before. But I just had to. Why? well, I have been avoiding to watch this anime for years, mainly because I don't really like the design of the characters and when it comes to manga/anime, I tend to chose stories with Japanese  settings. But recently I decided to give it a chance, since it’s usually a very well positioned show in all the rankings.  I guess I wanted to know why…\nSo now that I’ve finally\n          \n        watched Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, I can openly say that it is one of the most overrated shows of all times.  Please don’t get me wrong, I liked it, I really did. It’s not a bad show, it’s actually pretty good one, but I just can’t understand how it is so high on the list.  The story is good, the plot develops very skillfully. It’s a very epic show if “epicness” is what you’re looking for. However, for people like me, who may be more attracted by getting emotionally involved with the story and characters…. It just doesn’t feel enough.  This show could have been much more awesome if it had been given the time to deepen into the background of the characters. I just felt that most of the characters were plain and barely half developed. There are very nice characters with a lot of potential, but their personality just seems incomplete. This is very frustrating especially in the case of the “villains”. There you have a bunch of characters that could have been really badass but they are just purposeless. Their background, their psychological basis, their ulterior motives were almost inexistent. I really don’t know if it was a failure of the plot or if it was a failure of the adaptation that failed to embody their means and motivations.… Which, by the way, was way better constructed in the previous anime adaptation of Full Metal Alchemist.  In the previous adaptation, the homunculi had a more complex origin and a very contradicting nature, which made them way more interesting than they are in Botherhood. For instance, characters as Lust or Izumi, which were very charismatic in FMA due to their background story, are just empty shells in Brotherhood.  That’s pretty sad, because at the end you see the characters suffering and you get like “who are you again?”. At the end of the show I just felt I had not really been given the chance to truly get to know any of these characters, so I didn’t really care that much of what would happen to them.  In FMA I was really moved by most of the characters’ circumstances, but in Brotherhood it was like… yep, ok, this fight is sooo epic, but who was fighting again? What for?...\nIn addition FMA had those twisted scenes… kind of dark situations that came out of nowhere (let’s call them “small and subtle creepy Nina-like scenes” if you know what I mean) that would leave us all wondering what the heck did just happened and how such a nice show can become so creepy in just a second and immediately turn back to normal as if nothing had happened. That was pretty awesome in FMA, and there was no trace of that awesomeness in Brotherhood. \nMaybe I’m comparing the two animes a little too much, but I actually watched FMA after watching FMAB, and I just can’t help to think that there should be a third adaptation mixing the two previous shows. THAT could be the best show ever if they do it right.\nSo yep, leaving FMA aside for now, about Brotherhood I can say: yes, it’s a good story. Yes, it’s worth watching. Yes, after watching it you will look back and think “it was a good anime” . Plus it has a cool soundtrack, with very cool openings and endings, which is always appreciated.  But, if you watch it, do not expect it to be the best anime ever, because it is not. "},

Its greatest strength is its well-rounded, three dimensional main characters. Edward Elric and Roy Mustang, for example, are among the best to be found in the genre, but the strength of the cast is not without exception: by contrast, even someone as important as Alphonse is quite boring.\nSubtlety isn't its strong suit. The brothers moping in the rain or a toy robot walking into Alphonse as he ponders the nature of his being are moments where it feels like they're laying it on thick. Later, characters spout off their motivations and the revelations\n          \n        of their experiences mid-combat, which is a bit patronizing. It gets to the point where it drags down the pace at times, especially in the end, when it feels the need to maniacally tie up the arcs of every bit-player in the story.\nThe climactic sequences in general are a letdown. They're not the best in terms of the raw action and the villains become hard to take seriously - they take on stupid-looking forms and they practically defeat themselves. You could argue that this gives the series a certain degree of psychological merit, or at least that it works for the characters, but it certainly makes the battles less impactful. The mysterious elements of the story are disappointing once you know the secrets.\nFMA is a serious story, dealing with themes like revenge, genocide, and human experimentation, but there are moments where that darkness is poorly handled. Some of the villainous characters have under-developed motivations and there are a lot of comedic moments that don't fit well with the edginess around them. There are some jokes which serve to humanize the characters or create a deliberate sense of contrast, but a lot of the time it feels out of place.\nNothing in this show particularly thrilled me. There are no characters or moments that stand tall above the rest, or that I expect to remember a long time from now. It's undeniably competent, but not much more than that.\n        "},

I thought the FMA classic had a lot of supporting characters but this one breaks records in this task!! And it's not like they are useless... actually there some really charismatc!

The story introduces Homunculi too who happen to be immortal beings that are the main antagonists of the series. Plot sounds simple on paper but it's an intriguing concept if adapted well.\nArt: 10\nThe remake fulfills its purpose of improving the art, especially\n          \n        that the anime was made almost a decade ago, so having visuals comforting to the eye was enjoyable.\nSound: 9\nI don't remember much about the sound, but they did include the right tracks for fights and for more emotional scenes. The opening and ending songs are a favourite of mine.\nCharacters: 9\nEdward was a good protagonist, eventhough he seemed like a typical shounen character, but I tend to like these types, though he did disturb me a bit by avoiding using Philospher's stone since it was made out of human souls eventhough the souls are already gone so he could use these sacrifices to his advantage. Alphonse did not stand out too much, though he was cool too. The villains were all likable as well, as each had his own goals which made him different from the other, and they were not meant to be hated like most anime villains.\nEnjoyment: 9\nI enjoyed the series as a whole, but I felt like it was a bit stretched out, and some concepts of alchemy needed more explanations, and it may be my instinct, but I don't have a way to justify why I couldn't enjoy it to the max.\nOverall: 9\nI'd recommend it to anyone and I guess the top spot of anime is in safe hands with this.\n        "},

I have roughly seen both the Manga & the original and this anime is better than the original & manga in many ways, but can fail to be better in certain areas, the problems are extremely minor so It's not all of a bothersome to me.\nSTORY: 9\nIf your unfamiliar with the plot MAL does a\n          \n        nice job summing it up already, but I'll make a short summary. \nThere's two brothers named Edward & Alphonse Elric, they live in a fantasy like setting and alchemy is used for military or whatever else customs. Ed and Al's mother passed away, they try to bring her back using Alchemy, it obviously fails because Human Transmutation is a taboo amongst alchemists, Ed loses his left leg, Al loses his body, Ed bonds Al's soul to armor & Ed loses his right arm in exchange. Most of the anime revolves around them trying to fix what they've lost, and trying to seek the legendary Philosopher's stone or any other resource to restore their bodies back to normal.\nNow, unlike 2003 the first 15 or so episodes feel a bit rushed, you don't get to spend much time with Nina or the Hughes Family, there's also a lot of cut out things like for instance the Youswell's Coal Mine incident, where it just becomes a flashback in the story of Lieutenant Yoki. However, a lot of people think the creators believed most viewers have already seen the original FMA before viewing FMAB, so it was rushed so viewers could get to the new material faster. There's only this minor pasting problem. After around episode 15 this anime is fantastic & almost flawless.\nIn Brotherhood there's more to Amestris, Brotherhood opens up to world where more things do exist, such as Xing, Xerxes or Ishval.\nAlso, I'd like to mention..\nThe tone of Brotherhood feels more Adventurous & more Shounen like which sets a different tone from 2003 which is more philosophical & leans more to the darker scale. I personally loved both series for the different feel of the story.\nBrotherhood is also a good start out anime, it's got a variety of different genre's and it pulls it off extremely well, the balance between seriousness and comedy is a little iffy for the first couple of episodes, but it starts to balance out well as the anime progresses.\nART: 10\nThis is probably one of Studio Bone's best work; the animation is seriously flawless for this one. The action scenes look great, the openings are well animated. The Atmosphere feels right with the story, never had it felt out of place, the backdrops are visually nice, the character designs are unique and look cool, they fit their characters, there's no problems with getting a character mixed up, you can tell who's who easily. The art style wasn't bothersome at all. The simple effects like Alchemy & fire are also done really well in this anime. So yeah, there's nothing really to add, the art's fantastic.\nSOUND: 10\nThe soundtrack is much more \"Epic\" in terms of tone compared to 2003 being more somber. I personally like the more emotional tracks more, and that makes me like the 2003's OST a little more than Brotherhoods; but I understand that it wouldn't fit with the whole atmosphere, as Brotherhood is more adventurous & fantasy like in nature. Don't get me wrong, the OST is still amazing, I'm sad \"Brothers\" isn't in there because y'know that song literally has a huge label that says Fullmetal Alchemist on it, but it probably wouldn't really fit with the style of Brotherhood. Some of my favorite pieces from Brotherhood's OST are \"A soldiers honor\", \"Trisha's Lullaby\" or \"Crime & Punishment\". All openings in my opinion were great, I don't think I disliked any of them. Also, \"Again\" by Yui is amazing. The endings are all great as well. The sound effects are done well & the voice acting for Dub & Sub are phenomenal. I normally don't like English dubs, but this ones amazing.\nCHARACTER: 10\nNever have I liked ALL the characters in a anime before, the characters are extremely likable even if they were 'bad' or were 'villains' & their motives or goals were interesting to see. All characters had a purpose to be there even if they were just thrown there for a episode or two and never to be seen again. There's a vast amount of characters, but I'm going to focus on the two main characters- Edward & Alphonse Elric. Ed is probably one of my all time favorite anime characters. There's something about him that seems unique. He's a prodigy, he's moody & hotheaded and has a short temper (mostly when he's called short) but that's mostly for comedy purposes. Behind acting like a ass sometimes he's extremely caring for his brother, he'd do anything to protect him & would give up everything just to save him or get him back to his original body. Edward also isn't destined to win everything, he does lose and there's consequences to his mistakes. He's not a cardboard cutout like most shounen protagonists. Then there's Alphonse- He's Naive, innocent and could be easily manipulated. He really cares for his brother though, even more than himself & would do anything to protect him or get his arm and leg back to normal. I also enjoyed character development in this anime, as the anime progresses you get to see the Elric brothers mature a bit, same as the supporting cast, you get some insight on the villains motives as well.\nENJOYMENT- 10\nThis anime was enjoyable, actually one of the only anime's I've watched where I was gripped by the plot at any given moment. It was hard to stop watching this anime & I easily became hooked after the 3rd or 4th episode or so.\nOVERALL- 10\nWATCH IT NOW. If you haven't seen any Fullmetal Alchemist I'm jealous. It's a must watch, this & 2003 should be viewed by any anime fan even if it's just to say you watched it. \n\n"},

Other than that there is absolutely no reason not to categorize this as one of the most modern masterpieces I have laid eyes upon.\nAs a remake of the original TV series (although this was the original manga series) this anime completely destroys the image of the initial series FMA (although that was damn good too) and makes you burn all 64 episodes into your memory (pun with Mustang's flame alchemy here ;)\n          \n        ) \nThe most amazing character of Japanese animation, Roy Mustang appears here, with the most devastating series of villains I have ever seen after Kenshin. The entire storyline is so beautifully molded with elements of ancient ideals and state-of-the-art technology that its not only a visual treat, but delectable to the gray cells too. Character development is awesome and so is power level maintenance (what I mean by this is that each character gradually grows stronger or weaker, not suddenly and no one hogs power level e.g. Vegeta and Goku in DBZ.. everyone is similarly powerful and even non-alchemists are effective in most situations)\nThe storyline is one of the best and most innovative and reminds me of Haruki Murakami's writing in its fluidity and abstractness.. but none of the knots are tied in an illogical manner - everything has a clear basis (well except for maybe where the villain becomes God.. i didnt like that concept very much). Very original storyline.. really loved it as it unraveled slowly. Villains actually die here permanently instead of continuously haunting us after near death situations coming back ever stronger e.g CELL!!! (who else?? Buu too) Even though the villains are almost immortal, they've done a good job of actually bringing out each one's individual sin as a sign of mortality..loved it.\nFor guys/girls just about to set off on this grand 64 eps adventure I'm very jealous since I dont have time to re-watch this just now although I'd love to. Enjoy!! Definitely the best anime of the second half of this decade along with Shippuuden.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    To me, this anime is simply amazing. The best I've ever seen. Of course, I realize that I may be biased, as I've been a very big fan of the FMA manga for a long time now, but this series was such a faithful adaptation of the manga that I think it shows how well-crafted of a story Arakawa created in Fullmetal Alchemist.\nTo me, Fullmetal has always been a favorite because of its characters. Every single character is three-dimensional, meaning they have many different facets to their personalities; I really felt for these characters. The characters are all very likeable, and it is wonderful to\n          \n        watch them grow and develop throughout the series. Peoples' motivations, perceptions, etc can change, and that's what keeps the story interesting. I feel the core of this story is centered around the characters, and I think this series is best described firstly as a drama, then as action or adventure. Without me spoiling anything, I can assure readers of this that the plot and character development in Fullmetal is truly top-notch. The concept of Equivalent Exchange is discussed in the series too, and is a reoccurring theme. Taking this and its characters into account, Fullmetal Alchemist is more than just an excellent military-suspense-action show: it's a story about life and what it is worth to people.\nI especially liked the art style of this series- it was very very reminiscent of the manga. The show utilizes softer lines and a more muted, but still bright when needed, color palette. Some scenes in the show I swear looked as if the animators took specific panels out of the manga and relayed it on screen. A real treat for a fan of the original work like myself. I appreciated the attention to detail that catered to the already existing fanbase.\nThe action scenes are in my opinion very well done here. They are choreographed very well, and the suspense that is built up is fantastic.\nThe music in the series I thought was overall very good. I enjoyed all of the opening themes, especially the second one. The background music was nicely orchestrated and matched the scenes onscreen. Some of the endings were not memorable to me, but that's not uncommon in shows as long as this one.\nIn conclusion, for me this is an absolute must-see for any anime fan. Heck, I would try to recommend it to people who are not anime fans. The story is that well put together. I found myself rooting and yearning for the brothers' success so much this story- it's hard not to. Please take a look at this series- you'll be glad you did.\nP.S. Although I watched the entire series with Japanese audio, I have also seen some episodes with the English dub, and I am extremely impressed with it. I prefer to watch dubs most of the time, and Fullmetal so far has done an excellent job with their English dub.\n        "},

This anime is perfect in all senses: The story is awsome, philosophical and very catching, the art is really good, the soundtracks are amazing, one of the best i have heard in anime, the character development is just impressive, i enjoyed it so damn much.

Its true that the first anime adaptation was very good but it doesn't compare with the original (brotherhood). With this in mind let's begin the review and comparison of these two great series. \nThe first anime had a very dark story , with the action led by the main characters. It follows the manga up to the half of the story and from there is just filler. What I liked at the first series was the dark tone of the story and the sad ending. I didn't like the fact that Winry personality wasn't truly developed through the series, the\n          \n        fact that we have a small cast of characters and the plot twist at the end. The idea behind the plot twist wasn't bad but it didn't go well with story and it didn't explain exactly the meaning of the gate and of the alchemy. \nThe second anime that is an exact adaptation of the manga from the beginning to the end has a much complex story with the action led by the plot. In this remake we have a large cast of characters that are developed better than in the previous series, in the remake Winry is much more down to earth so to speak than in the previous series. In FMA Winry is just about automail but in the FMAB we see that she has feelings for both Elric and Al, especially Elric. I like the end of the remake because it show us the meaning behind the gate and because it is a happy one, and to be honest they deserve a happy ending :D. \nI like both anime series but because the second one has a much better plot  with characters better developed (being based on the manga) the second one goes in my Top 5 and the first one doesn't.\n        "},

I love how in this series, you get to see Edward and Winry, even Al, grow a little more, whether physically or emotionally or both. I like seeing a darker side of Mustang and his relationship with Hawkeye too. The plot was so dark and so much more expanded that at times, it was a little hard to keep up, but I understood it and loved it. The characters and art are amazing, as is the plot and the\n          \n        twists and turns and pure brotherly love (Elric fluff!)

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    In chronological order, I've watched the original FMA series (dubbed over in English, unfortunately), read the manga, then watched FMA Brotherhood (subbed in English, thank GOD!) after giving myself plenty of time in between. If you liked the original, you will LOVE Brotherhood. As other reviews have pointed out, there's a lot to love about this series. Instead of re-hashing all that for you, I'll just point out the differences between the original and Brotherhood and why these differences are the reason that the show's worth watching.\nPlot: the original series was really compelling as a stand alone. If you've never read the manga, then the\n          \n        orignal isn't too bad. BUT, if you're like me and read the manga (albeit for me I read it AFTER watching the original), you'll notice that the manga has a far more developed plot. And, if you're like me and watched the original and was satisfied with it (more or less, it's flaws and all) and therefore put off with having to watch Brotherhood, a whole other series, and are worried of being disappointed, let me tell you, YOU WILL NOT BE. (want reason? look at other reviews, they all say the same stuff, like the first reveiw that pops up for this). Basically, the plot, since it follows the manga, is friggin amazingly AWESOME and in no way can I find a fault or anything to put it down. Well, actually, I could probably say that the Japanese have a flare for wordiness, but it's for our benefit, considering that there is a lot to take in.\nAnyways, back to business. OTHER differences:\nSound: the music is much more dynamic in this series than in the original. There's a lot of varying during the whole series even though they do have a theme music they fall back to. But the music for this series reflects the darkness and twistedness of the plot. You get the sense of some underlying BAD right from the start because of the ambience the music produces. Then there are the voices for the characters, which were well picked, I believe, even for those who watched the original series and were put off by the thought of different voices screwing up preconceived ideas of the characters. None of this occured, but I'll get back to the point on the voices under Characters. Anyways, moving on, the beginning and ending credits change throughout the series, which in my opinion is a good thing because normally I would skip through credits, but the music and animation for them are worth the watch. Which leads me to my next point....\nDesign: one thing I noticed right away was that the background design differed from the first. The characters were still designed the same as the original, but the setting, like the music, created GREAT ambience. For instance, perspective is very effectively used to emphasize how twisted people can be. The angles for buildings or point of view angles are distorted, showing how distorted people can look at the world and how this world is full of some messed up stuff. It foreshadows the larger plot quite nicely. And anyone with an eye for design will notice how this change in perspective really helps to add to the whole series. It's very noticeable from the start for anyone who watched the original series, but as you progress through the episodes, you don't notice as much because you're so absorbed in the plot, but that doesn't mean that it's not still in use. Unlike the original, there was also much more effort put into the fluidity of the action scenes in Brotherhood. Like any anime, signs of laziness are evident the farther into the series you get. As though to make up for this, the action scenes, and even some of the smaller motions, like the swing of the head and hair, have amazing fluidity that makes watching the show such a delight for any anime fan who's tired of seeing lazy animation (no offence to animators, it's understandable that it would end up that way).\nCharacters: like some other review noted, because this series follows the original manga closely, you catch far more than just a wicked plot. There are great interactions between the characters. If you're like me and watched the original series but was disappointed that the girl didn't get the guy (sorta), then, because this follows the manga, you will be happy at how this series ends *hinthintwinkwink* (though that's pretty obvious). And like I said earlier, if you watched the original and liked the characters there, you'll love the characters even more in Brotherhood. There's more depth, more emotion, and the voices are well picked to reflect that (I was worried that I wouldn't be able to watch it because I really liked the English voices in the original, but the fact that the Japanese voices were so well chosen just goes to show that the English translation wasn't half bad for finding voices that were pretty similar. However, hands down, the Japanese is alwasy better!)\nOverall: YOU. MUST. WATCH. THIS. If you're looking for something with depth, THIS IS IT. There's no fluff, there's no over-ambition (and given the kind of alternative world this is set in, what large ambitions there are seem reasonable enough, all things considered. And besides, without a little ambition, things'd be BOOOORING), there's no time-wasters. You'll dive right in and get hooked! Admitedly, it's fast paced relative to the orignal, but it's to your advantage. The majority of this series is dedicated to the latter half of the manga so that we get right into the grit of it, skipping over some of the fluffy beginning while not compromising it in the least. I only suggest that you don't do all 3 (original series, manga AND Brotherhood) all in one go. I gave myself some space in between because, as mach as I liked the original and LOVED the manga, you're almost put off by the idea of having to go through it ALL OVER AGAIN after JUST having gone through it all ONCE. But, after you've given yourself some R and R, GO FOR IT. It's worth it!\n        "},

I had originally watched \"Fullmetal Alchemist,\" the original adaptation of the manga - which I have still not read - and while it was quite good, I never expected Brotherhood to be so superior in comparision.\nEverything about this anime is great, the reason I gave the art a 9 is probably because its not the usual anime art you would be used to, so I guess I'm just being picky. \nThere are a number of things I would say to describe this,\n          \n        but most of all it's inspirational. You can relate to the characters because they're not perfect, normally an anime might have someone who is stronger than the rest all the way 'till the end, but the characters in this anime show that everyone has weaknesses, and one of the main ways this is portrayed is through the '7 deadly sins,' which are named throughout the anime.\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gives you a sense of what really matters in life, with mind-blowing action and an incredible, addictive soundtrack to boot. Everything about this anime keeps you on your toes, as you walk beside the Elric brothers as they go through their journey, meeting fascinating new characters and learning valuable life lessons along the way.\nIf you haven't already watched this anime, start it. If you've dropped it, pick it up. The very least that this anime deserves is to be viewed to its full potential, and I hope that it touches, excites, and satisfies you as much as it did me.\n        "},

After a time i got a computer and because a recommendation a started to watch Fullmetal Alchemist. I enjoy it. I watched the movie too. I think it was a great end for the anime history.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    *for those people who are too lazy to read, skip to the end*\nThe big three: Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece. You have probably already watched these three anime or they might have even been the ones that got you into anime. Now, what do they have in common? That’s right, they’re all from the shounen genre. Now, the thing is, most of the shounen animes today almost always follow a preset formula in terms of plot, as if they copied it right of an instruction manual. The formula usually goes like: Badass MC appears, Badass MC gains friends, Badass antagonist appears, Badass MC gets his\n          \n        ass handed to him by antagonist, Badass MC gains power-up, Badass MC kicks the antagonist’s ass, then rinse and repeat. If you’ve been paying attention to most of the anime you watch, you’ve probably noticed this already. Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, on the other hand, despite being a shounen anime doesn’t seem to be like this at all, in fact, it is quite the contrary. If so, then how is it different?\n Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, which I will just abbreviate to FMA:B,  is different  by the fact that it doesn’t follow that retarded plot formula above. It actually has a well thought-out and gripping plot with a great balance between action and comedy. For starters it doesn’t just go like the regular Going-on-a-adventure or I-need-to-protect-my-nakama shounen type anime. To provide a short summary of the story, it is about Edward and Alphonse Elric. They are two brothers who live in a world wherein a certain type of people called alchemists, people who can transmute anything into something else using a transmutation circle, which is basically a circle which contains a set instruction inside, for as long as it obeys a law called the law of equivalent exchange. Now, the Elric brothers lost their mothers at a young age and decided to try and use alchemy to “transmute” her back to life using ingredients that make up the human body, but unfortunately, a human transmutation is not only prohibited by human laws but by the very laws of god, as a human soul is priceless. So instead of getting back their mother, God took Edward’s arm and Alphonse’s entire body as a toll, and Edward was forced to sacrifice his leg in order to transfix his brother’s soul into a metal body. Not everything is for naught though, because being able to see God and “being dragged through the gates of truth” and living to tell the tale offers a very handsome price: the ability to transmute without the use of a transmutation circle. Then, they proceeded to search for a way to regain their bodies and the solution they found is the Philosopher’s Stone, a legendary object which allows one to disregard the law of equivalent exchange. In their search, they became state alchemists, a group of alchemists who are employed by the state as human weapons. And with that, their adventure begins as they discover the secrets behind the nature of the Philosopher’s Stone.\nWell, no, adventure really isn’t the proper word for it. It’s more like chasing rumors to see whether they can find clues to see how to make or where to find a Philosopher’s stone. Now, onto the actual review. The thing that separates FMA:B from other shounen anime is its plot. Unlike other shounen anime that consists of loosely related arcs (think One Piece or Naruto arcs), FMA:B consists of several arcs which are closely related that serves to introduce bits and pieces of the story which at the end will all come together to form one complex plot. This is one of the strong points of FMA:B. The story seems a little slow at the start but once it picks up it really gets going. First it introduces the main points and the basic concepts of the story then proceeds to create conflicts which will keep on adding to the suspense of the story. Now, another thing that sets FMA:B apart from others is the way it answers the questions in the plot. Whenever it raises a question in the viewer’s mind, it usually answers it sometime later, but it also raises another question. This kind of technique makes it so that those who are watching it will always be at the edge of their seat, awaiting the answer to their questions. I know I was at the edge of my seat while watching this, and every time they answer a question and I decide to try and sleep, they leave a cliffhanger at the end which make me want to watch more, and that in itself is a very strong point since it can keep you glued to your seat. Despite this fact, they still manage to answer every question  they raise, leaving no plotholes in the story for as far as I can tell. Another great point of FMA:B is the good balance between the action and comedy. Despite being somewhat serious during the middle and end part of the anime, it still has those moments that can make you laugh and smile, despite the fact that the tension and suspense in the anime is already near its peak. To put it simply, FMA:B knows how to and when to put a good comic relief, and that gives it another point. Still, as with every anime, none of them are perfect. The only thing that I can deem as an imperfection in this anime is the fact that it sort of went overboard during the last 4 or so episodes, only to result in a somewhat anticlimactic defeat of the main antagonist. What do I mean by overboard? Well, to put it simply, it sort of went DBZ with laser beams flying around and that kind of stuff, although it was nothing major, just something I would like to point out. \nAlong with a great plot, FMA:B also comes with a great set of characters. To be frank, the character design of the MC character Edward Elric isn’t really all that unique, just your regular noisy kid who firmly believes that killing is bad. This doesn’t mean that he stays that way though, as another one of the great points of this anime if the fact that not only does the characters develop beautifully into fleshed out characters, each with their respective personalities, they also do it smoothly. The anime takes its time to carefully turn them into what they will be, without any sudden developments happening out of thin air(think Sasuke). And here’s something that completely sets it apart from the other animes. The antagonists themselves are developed so well that you actually feel sorry for them. Despite the fact that you will probably hate them at the start of the series due to them being complete assholes most of the time( which is also another good point, since they are antagonists), over time you will come to love them and even feel sad after their deaths. And I don’t mean that they pull a “Severus-Snape-actually being-a-ally” type of sad, antagonist death, I mean that they actually touch your heart during their last moments due to them finally realizing what they truly want. I personally found this as the strongest point of FMA:B, since of all the animes I’ve watched, only in this one did I ever feel a saddened due to the death of an antagonist, wherein in most cases I would just laugh like a maniac due to the horrible fate they suffered. \nAnd like always, there’s the animation and music. While not being that important, I got to give them props for being thorough with their animation. Unlike some others wherein they just loop a scene of the two people hitting each other, they actually took time to choreograph the fights scenes and the end results are just dazzling. Not only that, you can also see the sheer amount of detail they put especially in things like Edward’s prosthetic arm when Winry is fixing it, and like in Envy’s true form and inside GreedLing’s mind. Of course, the music is just about as good as the art. The OP’s are all catchy, although I wouldn’t have time to describe each of them because there’s a lot of them. Also, the BGM is really something else. The way they match the scene they’re played in is just wonderful. Not to mention, they can also get your blood pumping, as if it’s a BGM in a boss fight scene in a game.\nWith all of that, I can assure you that Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the best shounen anime during these recent years. I highly recommend watching it and I’m willing to bet my pride that it will not disappoint. Also, unlike other shounen titles, FMA:B is filled to the brim with action and doesn’t tend to drag things out, hence only 64 episode, which is quite short compared to the other, more known titles out there, so why not give it a try? \nTo provide a quick summary of the pros and cons:\n+Good plot\n+Almost all the characters are well-developed, antagonists included\n+No plotholes\n+Great animation with beautifully choreographed fights\n-The last fight at the end was over the top, only to end to the anticlimactic death of the antagonist\n-Some of the antagonists are more lovable than the MCs(not really sure if a con or not)\n-Nothing else really, except that the sheer number of badass characters in this anime can cause you to get jelly\n~First and foremost, thanks for reading my review.

I made the mistake of assuming Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was going to be like the original anime... and I was so very wrong. It has been a year or two since I finished it, so bear with me if I'm a bit inaccurate on some things.\nStory - 10\nCompared to the older anime adaptation and other series in general, this story is nothing short than amazing. It is one\n          \n        of few shows rated a 9+ on here that I don't feel was even a little bit overrated. Unlike most anime series it follows the manga, which is probably a good part of why it is so good. I know no anime is perfect and part of the reason I probably enjoyed it so much is because I wasn't expecting much, but from what I've seen this is as close to perfect as any series is going to get. It pretty much stays the same as the older anime up until around episode 13 or so, then it becomes completely different.\nArt - 9\nThe art isn't perfect, but it is still pretty good. It definitely does not make the series any less enjoyable and I actually think it suits this series. While I can think of series with better art, I just can't imagine this series with a different style.\nCharacter - 10\nIt isn't just the main characters that are interesting, all of them are. I'm not sure how to describe the characters other than that they only serve to make this series more enjoyable and there is plenty of character development.\nSound - 8\nIt has a pretty good soundtrack and the theme songs are enjoyable. There are a few songs I did not like, but Period by Chemistry has to be one of my favorite songs now. Like the art it is not perfect, but it is still pretty good and for the most part it fits into the series. This is probably a matter of opinion more so than anything else is.\nEnding - 9\nOne problem I see with a lot of series, is that they have a bad ending. I'm not going to talk about what actually happened in the end, but while not perfect it is definitely a lot better than the older anime and most other series I have seen.\nEnjoyment - 10\nI thoroughly enjoyed this series. I wasn't enthusiastic about it when I first started watching it, but since watching this it has easily become my favorite anime of all time. This is probably the only series I might actually re-watch.\nOverall this is one of the few series I would actually give a 10/10. You may look at the ratings and think this is overrated, but I think it has earned its high rating. It has been a long time since I finished this(roughly a year or two, I would say) and I am still impressed by this series. If you have watched the older anime and didn't like it, do not let that affect whether you watch this series or not - trust me, this is a LOT better than the older anime.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    ONCE AGAIN, LOOK OUT FOR SPOILERS.\nWhere do I begin? I was a bit reluctant to watch this series. When I was halfway through Fullmetal Alchemist, early last year, someone told me they were doing a new show more faithful to the manga. And I remember thinking ‘Crap, so why am I even bothering with this version?’. But I finished it, completed it with The Conqueror of Shambala and felt mildly satisfied. The series were brilliant apart from the eyebrow raising ending and the questionable movie plot. Only now that I’ve finished Brotherhood can I realize how far-fetched some arcs were but to each their own:\n          \n        Fullmetal Alchemist was a good achievement, but it has to be considered as something with a life of it’s own, unattached to Arakawa-sensei’s work. A bit like Rurouni Kenshin:Seisohen: good work, but if you end up thinking about Watsuki-san’s work your stomach will turn over. But I was still undecided whether to watch this or not until some brilliant opportunity came up: final exams. Is there a better time to watch a 64 episode long series? I highly doubt it (as a matter of fact note only, I did pretty well on the exams, so no worries).\nThe main plot is very much like Fullmetal Alchemist‘s: Edward and Alphonse Elric are the sons of renowned alchemist Van Hohenheim and Trisha Elric. When their father leaves the house, Trisha slowly perishes and the boys try to resurrect her through alchemy, with disastrous consequences. Ed loses his leg and gives up his arm in order to retrieve Alphonse’s soul, attaching it to a suit of armour. The brothers embark on a journey through alchemy to learn ways of getting their bodies back, finding themselves in a situation they didn’t ask to be in but is closer to their hearts than they think.\nHowever, the story changes drastically after Nina and Dr. Tucker’s arc, following the original work instead of making-up a story of its own. And I’m glad it did, because Tucker annoyed me incredibly in Fullmetal Alchemist. Brotherhood doesn’t include that questionable relationship between Scar and Lust, the far-fetched arc with Izumi’s son being an Homunculi with Ed’s arm and the whole thing about Envy being Ed and Al’s brother. Here, the Homunculi are simply Homunculi with no sappy past stories: although some of them have their own little personal tragedies, like Greed and, a favourite of mine, Envy, a character I’m sure everyone hated at first but actually felt sorry for in the end. This is another strong point in Brotherhood: the whole myriad of secondary characters that you can’t help but like. In fact, there isn’t a single character I didn’t like in the end, apart from Wrath who was just plain boring. Each character has their own purposes for fighting, something bigger than themselves moving them and each has a strong characteristic that makes them unique, whether it’s the little sparkles that float around Armstrong all the time (yes, they’re here too!) or Ling Yao’s constant hunger.\nAs for the main characters, Edward and Alphonse, they also endeavour on a physical and psychological journey that questions their sense of right and wrong and opens their eyes to what people can do as means to achieve a bigger end; in this case, something terrible personal wish. All the defects of men are here, personified in the Homunculi and in humans as well: vanity, ambition, selfishness, jealousy, envy. I think vanity and selfishness, thinking about what you want regardless of the others, are the most proeminent. If it weren’t for them, none of the characters would be in the mess they find themselves in. I think Alphonse develops more than Edward. He’s a personal favourite of mine, so I may be defending him, but he changes from a shy kid who lived in his brother’s shadow to a selfless albeit courageous young man, and this we can see when he decides to leave his body behind for a little while longer. He had everything he always wanted right in front of him, but someone else needed him most. It must’ve been a really tough decision not to be taken lightly. As for Edward, and I do like him as well, he evolves from a kid who thought he owned the world to someone who realizes the world is made up of ugly truths, but he doesn’t really apply this knowledge on himself. Sure, his final decision is very courageous as well, but I saw more maturity in Alphonse than in him. But then again, since Alphonse is one of my favourite characters, I might be biased. Tell me your opinions!\nThis show also brings Hohenheim to light, and he became another favourite of mine. Instead of the evil guy who makes Homunculi out of his offspring, we have a severly misunderstood man who craves for his sons acceptance and who, basically, started it all. He feels on his shoulders the responsibility to end it as well, alone; to his astonishment, he meets his sons along the way and their broken relationship is put to the test, to heart warming results. I also liked to see how Hohenheim and Edward are alike, not only in looks, as you will see on the photo below, but in attitude either: Ed hates being called small, Hohenheim hated being called stupid. They both reacted exactly the same way. The way they brag is also identical. It’s really a like father, like son story.\nIn the end, the good guys win and get everything they wanted but with a bittersweet touch. A very bittersweet touch. You will cry your eyes out in the end, this I guarantee. It’s really cathartic… in a way, it embodies everything Fullmetal Alchemist failed to bring.\nBrotherhood is a nearly perfect show. The animation is superb (the fight scenes are so amazingly fluid they will make you want more and more), the soundtrack is magnificent and especially haunting in the most emotional scenes (especially in the final episodes) and you know the best thing? No fillers at all. It’s just plot moving forward episode after episode. I might just add something I think is very important here: the technical aspects of the show are impecable, like I just said, but this is one of those cases where the characters make the story. They simply shine and, in my sky, they will do so for a very long time.\n[for more reviews, figures and photos of this article tune into http://ritsuinfigureland.wordpress.com!]\n        "},

In a world that revolves around Alchemy.\nThe story starts with the Elric family, the two brothers, older brother Edward and younger brother Al, and their mother. While the father has left home for a long while. \nDespite the absence of their father the brothers live a happy live with their mother and their childhood friend Winry. All while having taken a interest for the Alchemic arts and studying their dad's Alchemy books.\nWhen their mother dies\n          \n        due to a illness, the boys decide to bring their mother back to live with Alchemy. What seemed to be innocent childrens wish to see their dear mother one last time, turned out to be the brother's biggest mistake... and the beginning of their difficult journey, to regain what they have once lost.\nFMA: Brotherhood isn't to be confused with the FMA anime that came before it. The FMA: Brotherhood anime follows the storyline of the manga. \nWhile the first FMA series seems to have a original storyline which is completely different from the Brotherhood storyline. Though the beginning and the motive for the brothers their journey is still the same.\nYou can watch both FMA series if you'd like, but in my personal opinion i prefer and enjoyed the Brotherhood series more. But that doesn't mean the previous FMA serie is a bad anime, it's just different.\nAnd basicly, you can watch the FMA: Brotherhood anime and follow the storyline easily, even if you didn't watch the former FMA series that came before Brotherhood.\n\nNow, about my ratings for this anime;\nStory 10:\nThe story is well written, as you watch the anime, you notice just how good everything that happens eventually fits together like a puzzle. Also, the story has, action, drama, comedy, shocking moments, conspiracies, and a bit of subtle romance i think.\nOfcourse the brothers play the main parts and you will see them wrestling with past regrets, and their current hardships, but also their happy moments and succes. \nAl while supporting each other and as they go on their journey they'll meet new friends and allies who help them in their quest. I enjoyed it. \nAnd like with most other shounen anime, friendship plays a part aswell.\nArt 10:\nNot much to say about this really, just that i liked the art style of the serie and the characters.\nSound 9: \nThe only reason i gave this a 9, is because i didn't like al the opening theme's of the anime, but that's just a matter of taste. The voice acting was good, and nothing wrong or bad about it in my opinion.\nCharacter 10: \nBesides the two Elric brothers, the cast exist of many other fun, cool and enjoyable charcters who shine in their own right, not being put in the background by the main characters.\nThe rest of the cast, have their own past, regrets, sorrows, goals and joys you'll get to know about throughout the serie, although with some charcters more than with others.\nEnjoyment 10:\nLike i mentioned before, i enjoyed this anime, so much that i'v watched it twice now, mostly because i really liked the ending. If you're curious about this anime, you should give it a try, i recommend this anime.\nOverall 10:\nFull Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, is a good anime, with enjoyable charcaters, a very well written storyline, good voice-acting and soundtrack, good looking art.... what else do you need?\nGive this anime a honest chance and you will be pleasently suprised at how good it is, and best of all, you can watch the entire series now, episode-after-episode, without having to wait a week for the next episode.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    First of all I can definitely see why it's a lot of people's favorite anime. There's a reason why it's ranked so high. It also has some of the deepest feels in anime history. It's a different kind of feel than the psychological things that darker anime can throw at you. It's a simpler kind of feel. Although this show is about alchemy, it's very relatable. This show will make you want to hug your parents and siblings. This show just gives you raw emotion. There's nothing really to think about. Everybody knows what it's like to lose something that they love.\nStory: 10\nOur amazing main\n          \n        character, Edward Elric, loses his left leg when trying to perform human transmutation to resurrect his mother. His brother's body disappears completely, so Ed sacrifices his right arm to bind his brother's soul to a suit of armor, making him a golem. His brother can't enjoy the simple things of life like eating. So they both go on an adventure to get their bodies back. I wanted to phrase the plot of the show in my own way, because I just want to emphasize how deep this show actually is. It will most likely make you cry. They really couldn't have made the story any better. So much thought and emotion was thrown into this anime. This anime is also the perfect length.\nArt: 10\nVery pretty animation. Definitely deserves a 10. I HAVE seen better, but that doesn't mean that this animation style and quality deserve anything less than a 10. I can only say good things about it.\nSound: 10\nGoing off of the feels of the overwhelmingly deep plot, we have the haunting chorus from \"Lapis Philosophorum\" and all of its forms. Also, this anime has 5 intros and outros, and THEY ARE ALL GOOD! It's really rare for that to happen. This soundtrack is perfect. Just as much time went into it as with everything else. That is apparent.\nCharacter: 10\nOkay, as good as EVERYTHING about this anime is, this is probably the best part. The characters are incredible. All of them. They are all deep and all have fantastic backstories. If they don't make you cry, I don't know what will. The main villain is really cool, too. Definitely in my top 10 villain list. I can't say ANYTHING bad about them, and I don't want to say any spoilers. So I think that I'll leave it at that. Also, there are some biblical references in some of the characters, which is interesting whether one is religious or not.\nEnjoyment: 10\nWhat's not to enjoy about this anime? I was so sad when it ended. I'm usually really critical about things, and I would critique it if I could. The ONLY thing I could nitpick is one thing during the end, and that's how a couple of our main characters handled a particular death, but I'm not going to spoil anything. But that's it, and that's me really looking for something to complain about.\nOver: 10\nObviously I'm going to give this a 10. There are 10s across the board. I'm going to have to rewatch this anime with my dad, since he likes the anime that I show him. Anyway, this anime will always be close to my heart.\n        "},

There's a lot to the story, and it's very intriguing. The story itself is interesting and has a lot of potential, but it's bogged down by the frustrating pace. More than half the time I find myself just plain bored. \nThe characters are only mildly interesting. I cannot stand the amount of little kids in this show.Whenever there's action or drama, the tension is ruined by the irritating attempts at humor. The characters make faces and exaggerate. It completely drops me out\n          \n        of the moment.

I neglected watching it for a while because I don't normally agree with the masses when depicting what makes a great anime. \n I tried watching the first episode some time ago and it honestly bored me. I couldn't bring myself to keep watching it.  And now, I was running out of good anime to watch and decided I would finally go through it. \n I can't say that I didn't enjoy it. But for so many people to claim\n          \n        it to be the best or greatest anime ever, the only reason I can fathom that they would think so, is because they haven't really watched that much anime. Because it was far from being great in my mind. If anything it was really good at best. No better or worse than most anime I have watched.  It introduces so so many characters, many of which you never really get to learn a great deal about. The story however, was quite intriguing and did at least get a happy ending, which is more than what many anime get. Many other shows I've watched are lucky to get a second season, let alone a proper ending.\nAll that being said, I've watched hundreds of different shows, which may not be an immense amount to some people but even still, I likely wouldn't even have this in my top 20 favorites. It would be safely in the middle of the pack with the rest of the shows I rate an 8/10.  Good enough to keep me busy for a few days but not great enough for me to want to watch again.\nSo if you're bored and haven't seen it yet, then watch it. You'll probably enjoy it if you enjoy most anime.  But don't expect it to be the best thing created  since sliced bread.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I'm going to talk about an anime that I love, and that inspired me a lot. Has anyone here ever heard of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood? No? So they probably must have known the first version, since it was aired on Rede TV a few years ago.\nFullmetal Alchemist, the first version that was on TV, was one of the anime I knew in my childhood but at the time I could not watch all the episodes, but last year (2016), when I started to watch more anime I was curious to know the unfolding of So I decided to watch it, and after finishing I loved\n          \n        the story and I decided to search more about it and I ended up finding a video [AMV] about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, which aroused my curiosity and when I searched I found that it was the faithful anime version To the manga which led me to watch and fall more in love with this incredible work and take my top 1, there is only one word to describe this anime, EPIC !!\nBefore beginning to review the work, I will first explain to readers the differences from the original \"FMA\", which had 51 episodes and was screened in 2003 for the Brotherhood.\nThe normal \"FMA\" was released first, follows the story of the manga to a certain extent and then differs completely, having a unique and exclusive end. I would like to add that even though the original anime is inferior, I actually intend to talk about it at another opportunity. The end was a request from Arakawa (author of Manga who gave birth to the animations), who would like to see something different being done in his work (but she had no part in producing it).\nBut today I will speak of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, which faithfully follows the work of the manaka Arakawa during all his 64 episodes.\n\n- Scenery, ambiance and visual effects\nThe scenarios are very colorful and well made, the strokes are light and different from what we see around. The atmosphere of the anime is very varied, from houses, the headquarters of the alchemists, to sewage networks where fights and scenes occur more in the dark.\nIt is not a dark anime, but it manages to pass on all the emotions that perfectly match each event.\nThe characters are very well designed and created. The movement is very well created and it is difficult for you to see deformations, unless of course, in the scenes that the director and author wanted it to be.\nThe movement in the fights is good, none of the many smudges and senseless images. Bursts, lightning, and the like certainly combine with the environment without being exaggerated.\n\n- Sound effects, dubbing and soundtrack\nPerfect, the sound effects are very unique and well made, none of them flee from the mood of the scene or become exaggerated. The soundtrack is wonderful, counting on famous songs and with simply perfect lyrics, that super combined with all the anime.\nAs for the dubbing of Brotherhood, I must say that it is very good and perfect every voice combines with your character and the synchronization is perfect. But the original Japanese voices are very good as well, they fit well with each character's distinct personality and they were not forced, but I liked watching dub [Brazilian Dubbing].\n\n- Characters, personality\nThe characters are very well created and developed. Each one has its life history and of course, its private life outside the events of the anime, which is very cool since the two points develop in a clear and easy to be understood.\nWith all the certainty of the world the anime personalities are incredibly distinct from character to character. Edward, the principal is hard, intelligent, fun and sentimental, his brother Alphonse is more timid, equally clever, more malleable and a little more ... Compromised by others.\nAfter them we still have characters like Roy Mustang, Winry, Riza, Hughes and even Ganancia, one of the homunculi.\nAll characters have their power to influence each of us. In the face of well-developed personalities you can become very attached to each of them, and even get to hate certain characters with the greatest ease.\nI must also say that the traits of each are very beautiful, different and unique,\nMy favorite character could not be any different, it's Edward. He is a nanny with a tall complexion with a willpower to drop his chin. Edward's life story has encouraged me and inspired me a lot, and let's combine? There is no way to watch the anime and not like the character.\n\n- Development and Plot\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of the best built anime I've ever seen. It was certainly an anime that further leveraged the genre Shounen and today it is difficult to see an Otaku who has never checked the series or at least not heard.\nThe plot is set in 64 well-developed episodes, the events are always very clear and explained, and even those that remain in mystery, end up having their pieces together until the end of the series without any problem, allowing us all to understand Very well everything that happened.\nThe development takes place at a pleasant pace, nothing happened as I said before gets confused, nothing.\nThe plot itself is fascinating, the story is very good, the discoveries are very good and the coolest of all is that throughout the course of the anime one learns important life lessons that are learned by each character. Ed, I believe you teach the most.\nAnd for those who think that it will see an anime only full of blood, fights and sadness, is deceived. Fullmetal has several very funny scenes, be it Ed, Hughes, Ling among other excellent characters in the play.\nFullmetal Alchemist, has a mix of feelings and sensations that makes the series very unique for each.\nLike the scene where Shou Tucker turns his daughter Nina into a chimera, it was one of the ones I was most excited about in the anime. The sadness and anger that Ed demonstrates is so strong, and you get so attached, so much so that little Nina, who has been transmuted to her dog by her father's monster, that it is impossible not to be moved by wondering why a father would This with her own daughter.\nThe scenes involving Hughes are also incredibly touching, impossible to identify with the feelings of that moment.\n\n- Conclusion\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is highly recommended if you want to know a great and addictive anime in every way.\nThe story is great, it's not a stationary anime, it has fights in the right dose, blood in the right dose, sadness, agony anyway, in the right dose.\nI honestly can not not speak well of this anime. Although the first version is very good too, I believe that the second leveraged the name Fullmetal Alchemist forever, after all, is used as reference of the genre to this day.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one of those rare anime series that found acclaim all around the world. The reviews in this forum has already shown how popular it is in the Anglosphere. I just like to add on that in her native country, Japan and in the Sinosphere, this anime received similar universal praise. For example, on douban (the most critical Chinese movie review site), it has a rating of 9.4, the best of any anime. In Taiwan, it was voted unanimously as the best in the last decade on a similar review site. In Japan, Arakawa has won two awards for the manga and\n          \n        was consistently voted as one of the best anime/manga ever. So why do this story resonates with so many people across different cultures? Perhaps, it is because its story is on an epic scale spanning several regions/countries. It deals with moral values and dilemmas that would concern any human. Its characters are relatable and believable. Its pacing is astoundingly crisp and to the point. The artwork especially the fight scenes are done extremely well. The story has a satisfying conclusion and feels complete. It is certainly not perfect but every aspect of this shonen anime is near the very best of its genre. If only I can write and draw as well as Arakawa...\n        "},

I originally didn't want to watch this because I binge watch all animes, so 64 episodes seemed too time-consuming. BUT after finally being nagged by my friend to watch, I did, and I was sucked into it. It's so worth the time it takes!\nThe plot is action-packed but incorporates some deep themes (e.g. nature of humanity, divine power, family) and light-hearted moments as well! \nThe art is great. Everything is full of color, and the contrast between duller scenes really serves well to emphasize the more sullen nature of them. I also think the classic anime expressions\n          \n        were incorporated very well. The battle scenes are depicted amazingly too.\nI really liked the soundtrack, though it doesn't make it my top 1.\nI think the character development was good, and it was present in supporting characters as well! In fact, I'd say the character development in one of the supporting characters matches (or even exceeds) that of Ed himself. The only complaint I have about the characters is that Winry seems to become irrelevant towards the end of the series, which was a bit disappointing.\nOverall, this is a great and must-see anime. If you want action, it's here. If you want humor, it's here. If you want deepness, it's here. \nOne thing I find particularly interesting is how although this anime/manga is probably the most well-known shonen, it was actually authored by a woman. I liked observing the contrasts between the various female protagonists, but that analysis is just for me :)"},

What a kick-ass series this is!!\". This was my second time watching the series and let me tell you, the series just gets better and better as you keep repeating it and another thing to be noted is that this is far more better than the original FMA (you will eventually find out once you watch both the series). \n\nThe story of FMA:Brotherhood is what other anime writers crave to develop but fail miserably, this being said I don't want to underestimate other worthy anime series out there.Law of Equivalent exchange was one of the major bases in the show and I must say that it was pretty much well executed by the series.The story progresses in a subtle way and has it's twist and turns, twists and turns which will probably blow your mind off.Overall, The story of two brothers who performed the ultimate taboo in alchemy; Human Transmutation go on a rugged and dangerous journey to get their bodies back and in the course of getting their bodies back they meet different people and face many obstacles is pretty well handled.Pretty Surprisingly, this series was able to include almost everything in it i.e action, comedy( the comic timing between the characters and the comedy was just awesome), emotion, drama, fantasy, etc \nThe characters in this series are one of the best part of this series, The main characters of this series around whom the series is based are pretty well protrayed and the development of the characters is absolutely flawless. My favourite characters in the series were Winry rockbell and Edward Elric, their portrayal in the series was awesome. The worst character in the series must be Envy (OH god! Seriously Envy gave me creeps). Many other characters are introduced in the series here and there and their portrayal in the series was also fine.\nThe music and the soundtrack in this series was just freaking awesome. I can express in words how much I liked the OP and ED of this series, as each and every one of them tends to go with the flow of the series and all of them were able to grip my interest.The sound effects in the series is also good and enhances the viewing experience of the viewer during the series.\nOverall, FMA:Brotherhood entertains viewer in each and every episode and leaves them at the edge of their seats with the sudden twists and turns in the episodes. Also, FMA:Brotherhood is far better than the original FMA as the story is better faced and the characters are portrayed better in this series. The series is also successful in portraying comedy, violence, fantasy, drama, emotions, etc in a managed manner. So, I recommend this anime to every person, and especially who are against anime as this anime will definitely change the view of such people. \nWhat are you waiting for? Just give it a try for heaven's sake.  I doubt you'll regret watching it. \n"},

I myself has always been a fan of good endings...\nDo you ever wonder what defines a great show, or how great a show possibly can become, well... then i know for a fact, that you haven't seen Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood yet, because FMAB masters all these things almost flawlessly.\nFullmetal Alchemist: brotherhood is a show that strives for perfection. You can look all you want for flaws, but you won't find them easily. Though animations, characters, soundtracks etc. are great, I feel\n          \n        like i should focus more on telling you about the story, as the story is thing that distinguish most from other series. Because the rarity of a great story is so extreme, and this might be your only chance to see something close to perfection.\nNot only is it unique and original, but it constantly pops up some kind of new plot twist, so you can never truly predict what happens next.\nFMAB would probably be the only show that never left it's original plot. There were some side stories, but if they first started on a side story, they would at least tangle it up with the main story and follow the story up to the end.\nSummary:\nAnyways... A great show that needs to be seen. I would recommend watching the original FMA first because of some inquiries that tends to be in a few count of episodes in FMAB. Also the first 12 episodes of Brotherhood is kind of a recap of what happened the first (ca) 1-28 episodes in FMA. Even though they have made it possible to be seen without seeing FMA..."},

It is very original and unique.Always being unpredictable,always catching you off guard with the plot twists and revealations,always making you think.Also the pacing is godly,not even the fights slow the plot down.Not to mention zero filler in existence and the ending is a god send.no complaints here.(10/10)\n\nArt-The\n          \n        art's pretty good and the animation is even better.It can just be really inconsistent at times like the character models,their faces for example.Animation never fails to impress.The  fights are also short,always interesting to watch,they,never feel dragged on characters like Mustang and Bradley often get the best animation strapped to their fights.The artwork usually changes when a gag scene is on screen.I recommend watching this in blu ray as well to see the art at it's highest quality,just can be inconsistent at times but in spite of that,i don't care,it's a 9.(9/10)\nSound- Sound is good between great.I'm a bit mixed with some of the new openings and endings and alot prefer the 2003's fma over them though I do favor openings 2,4, and 5 and endings 4 and 5.The ost is really good and really help convey the mood being on screen,though it can be unfitting at times,though at least they're played and stopped at the right times though alot of it is really fitting for the action scenes and gets better the farther you watched into the anime.Also,the voice acting for the dub is superb,all of funimation's voices really suit their characters persona and are well acted,no complains there. The dub Voices earn  itself a 10 while the ost,ops and endings get a 8.(8/10)\nCharacters-My favorite aspect about the show besides the story.The characters.lots of good ones here,even the minor ones.Your bound to find one to latch on to and we see a lot of them develope.\nWe get all sorts characters here like the military amestrians, the Ishvalans, and theXingese,The military amestrains are by far my favorite group of characters to watch on screen,many of whom wear the same uniform but have very distinctive personalities between them but that doesn't make the ishvalans and xingese characters any less interesting. The villains are based on the 7 deadly sins.speaking of protagonist,Edward Elric is a great one,I never get bored watching him on screenMy personal favorite crackers are Roy Mustang, he's the ambitious,arogant, snide, and manipulating Type ,the infatuation family obsessed loving realist Maes Hughes,cold,loyal and stoic Riza Hawkeye,and Greed.Really the best part about the show next to the story,not as single one feels bad or a waste of space,they all felt important to the story (10/10)\n\nOverall-I enjoyed the anime all around from start to end except maybe the first select few(first 13 episodes,after that it was great),after that it comes the most enjoyable shounen to me,really strong unforgettable anime with lots of message. I recommend this show to new comers and veterans alike,there really is something for everyone here for all demographics,if not then most.even if you don't initially get attached to the show's character and plot,you should watched and experience this anime at least once.Totally worth all the praise and attention it gets. (10/10)\n"},

While some people say that it is close to the manga, I myself have not read the manga so I do not know whether this is true or not.\nStory 10:\nThe story at first is awkward if you have seen the original FMA, but after about two episodes this no longer really matters.  Unlike the original everything is wrapped up into a tight ball, with out any strange occurrences that end up having no real effect on the over all story.  The story pulls you along very\n          \n        nicely and to be quite honest makes you want to know what happened next.  The ending does not leave a bad taste in your mouth the way that the original did.\nArt 8:\nThere is not much to say over all on the art, as far as it goes it is above standard, but nothing spectacular.  Though it is important to note that while the basics are kept the same between the original and this one, this one does improve the over all artwork.\nCharacter 10:\nI always loved the characters from the original, and they are depicted even better in this one in my own personal opinion.  \nOverall 9:\nNow while I think that this is a phenomenal anime, and all, it only gets a great on over all because though it has so many good qualities, it is still lacking in a few areas.  Though I honestly recommend that any one who is interested in this anime should take the time to watch it.\n        "},

But with also enough lulls in the storyline such that it's not incredibly action packed every episode.\nThe range of characters and their personalities are also very well balanced and contrasted against each other in the appropriate situations. Should it be military personnel providing a more serious atmosphere, to more rowdy/different characters such as Edward himself to provide a bit of humour.\nCertainly, this is a must watch, and it's\n          \n        hard not to be disappointed by this series.\n        "},

Honestly, I have to say that Brotherhood was the better of the two. The first season was great but the ending and some plot changes (compared to the manga) were just some things I didn't like I guess. Brotherhood was funny, creative, heart pounding, and heart wrenching. This series is unlike any other with the story of two brothers in search of something they're not sure even exists: the Philosopher's Stone.\nJust reading about FMA: Brotherhood drags you in and once you start watching it, you'll\n          \n        be sucked in for sure.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Fullmetal Alchemist is one of my favorite anime series of all time.  When I heard there was a new Fullmetal Alchemist coming out I was excited but then I read that this would be a recreation of the original series but following closer to the manga I was disappointed.  How could they possibly make this series be better than what it already was?  This will be a complete train crash. I could never have been more wrong.\nI would recommend watching the original series before embarking on Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as it allows for you to make a good comparison between the two\n          \n        series which are both worth watching but, it’s not necessary.  \nThe overall plot here is essentially the same as the original Fullmetal Alchemist with some improvements in the sub plots.  The Brotherhood series is also longer than the original by 12 episodes so there is a bit more to watch.  Brotherhood has moments of excitement, action, and drama blended together with perfection making it one of my favorite plots in any anime series.  Character development throughout the show is considerably noticeable through the long adventure Ed and Al partake in.  The villains are also superbly developed doing that much more for the overall plot.\nOne of my favorite parts of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the music and dialogue.  The music is seamlessly sewn into the show providing emphasis when needed and enhancing the overall mood of the show.  The music is blended in so well that if you aren’t looking for it you most likely won’t even notice it.  Considerable time must have been put into the development of the dialogue.  But the subbed and dubbed versions are very nicely done and are not overly cheesy as in many series.  \nThere are 3 distinctive animations styles used throughout the series that may or may not be accompanied by different art styles and are often situational.  Each different style complements its situation.  I really enjoy the exaggerated and semi-elongated style used in combat.  It helps to provide a sense of intensity.\nFullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a very fun and exciting series.  It is one of the beast shows anime has to offer and I would recommend it to anybody whether they are just getting into anime of have been watching it for a while. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n\nI really enjoyed the first Fullmetal Alchemist anime series and when I heard that they would be releasing another series of the anime which would follow the manga I was ecstatic. Although at first I must admit I was slightly sceptical as the first anime series was absolutely brilliant and at the time I didn’t think that they could top it. However my concerns were unnecessary as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood took all the impressive qualities from the first series and simply polished them. In the process of doing so, it practically eliminated all weaknesses from the first series and created a true work of art.\n          \n        The misplaced comedy was removed. Nearly no scenes which are intended to be dramatic are accompanied by slapstick humour. Brotherhood’s visuals are of a considerably higher calibre and so are its action scenes. What truly separates FMA: Brotherhood from its original counterpart however is the way in which it explores profound philosophical themes. The level of depth in Brotherhood’s story is astounding. It avoids any form of fillers, unlike the original, and uses every single one of its episodes effectively. Take any episode out of FMA: Brotherhood and it will be missing a vital organ in its body.\nThe story of Fullmetal Alchemist follows the two main protaganists Edward and Alphonse Elric who are two alchemist brothers searching for the legendary catalyst called the Philosopher's Stone, a powerful object which would allow them to recover their bodies (which were lost in an attempt to bring their mother back to life through alchemy). Born in the village of Resembool from the country of Amestris, the two brothers lived there with their mother. Their father, Van Hohenheim, left home for unknown reasons and years later, their mother Trisha Elric died of a terminal illness, leaving the Elric brothers alone. After their mother's death, Edward became determined to bring her back through the use of alchemy, an advanced science in which objects can be created from raw materials. They researched Human Transmutation, a forbidden art in which one attempts to create or modify a human being. However, this attempt failed, ultimately resulting in the loss of Edward's left leg and Alphonse's entire body. In a desperate effort to save his brother, Edward sacrificed his right arm to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Some days later, an alchemist named Roy Mustang visited the Elric brothers, and proposed that Edward become a member of the State Military of the country in exchange for more research materials to find a way to recover their bodies.\nToo many anime which have such flatness in their characters, that they could easily be likened to what they actually are: pixels. Fullmetal Alchemist's characters are not just complex but contain an incredible honesty in themselves. Their personalities are alive and carry on throughout the entire series. Even when characters change, they do it in a way unique to their own being. The amount of detail and effort this show puts into characters is astonishing. Even the foils are among the best in anime. Never is a character brought forth without delivering a crucial message to the story. On top of the wondrous substance are also breathtaking aesthetics. I enjoyed every single one of the introduction and ending theme songs, and the background music can at times be beautiful. The action sequences are accompanied by intense tunes and detailed sound effects. The visuals are absolutely fantastic, even for Bones. The landscapes and towns are visually stunning, the clothes and character designs are thought out to the finest detail, and facial expressions are shown with a carefulness few anime can match.\nFullmetal Alchemist is so much more than what this review writes of it. There is only so much I can say without spoiling it. That is what great anime do. Fullmetal Alchemist is one of those few anime in which a fan of literature such as myself can find a substance and profundity that parallels that of a great novel. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood tells the story of a boy who, through his outer and inner journey, will establish an understanding of the moral essence which connects every human being. I highly recommend you watch this anime.\n        "},

FMA Brotherhood over rides FMA because its more enjoyable, adventurous, dramatic, hilarious, everything. Dont get me wrong FMA was a great series too, however if you think that you dont need to watch FMA Brotherhood because you watched FMA..you are completely WRONG!! Basically Brotherhood focuses more on the manga story line so if you read the manga you know how amazing the story line gets. How Edward and Al meet even more people, than the original FMA series shows. FMA Brotherhood seriously had me crying,\n          \n        laughing, smiling, anxious, etc. As the story progress's on you get more connected with Edward and Al on their journey to get there bodies back. You meet even more memorable characters like the people from Xing, you see that not all homunculus are not bad *Greed*. FMA Brotherhood also shows you the little love story developing between Ed and Winry which the original FMA series just over looked. Seriously this is a must watch series, if your a fan of FMA in general then you MUST MUST MUST watch FMA Brotherhood!! Even if you havent watched the original series FMA, you can start with FMA Brotherhood. It doesnt matter! Just know with Brotherhood your gonna be captive once you start watching it. Its hard to stop! SO GO WATCH IT! You wont be sorry, i promise that!\n        "},

I watched the original FMA and absolutely loved it, I had no knowledge of the manga, and was just watching it for the pleasure of it, not the manga or something else.  FMA was hands down the best anime I had ever seen, up there with Cowboy Bebop and the like.  I didn't pirate it, I purchased the DVD sets because they were so good that they sure as hell deserved my money for the great work they did.  I started out watching Brotherhood with the preconception that the differences were \"Brotherhood is more lighthearted\" and\n          \n        \"Brotherhood splits off in story at episode 14\".  Those were my only preconceptions.  I'll admit, the first 10 or so episodes had wayyyy more anime faces and sillyness than I'd ever seen in FMA before, but I got used to it, because I was persistent in the fact that it had a completely different take on the FMA universe and I really wanted to experience it again.  Once it hit around episode 20, it started getting darker and more brutal, like the old FMA, which was something I preferred.  The character development and background stories were SOOOOO detailed and fleshed out that I was blown away at how much of the characters I didn't understand or know before.  There were just so many incredible details and little tidbits that I NEVER knew and it just blew me away to hear it and wonder why I never heard it or was aware of it before.  The story was amazing, it was so twist-y, addicting, and cliffhanger-y.  This is the most addicting show I've ever watched, I sat down and watched 12 episodes one day.  That's 12 x 20 minutes = 240 minutes of Brotherhood straight in ONE sitting.  I've never been so enthralled and involved in any anime or visual entertainment of ANY kind.  I don't want to write a wall of text, because I could, but FMAB takes the awesome FMA series (which I didn't think could get any better), improves absolutely EVERYTHING, and blows the doors off of any anime I've ever seen in my entire life.  To quote what I said to one of my best friends about the anime after finishing it: \"I can wholeheartedly say it is honestly the best thing I've ever seen in any art form or medium of entertainment in my entire life ever.\"  It's a bold f***ing statement, but I've never been so taken by anything like Brotherhood.   \n        "},

They're very different stories after the first few episodes so if you're planning on watching either, I'd recommend you see both. \nThe original Fullmetal Alchemist is much darker and quite slowly paced at times, but the characters are developed superbly, and you have sympathy for the villains which is always a good thing in my opinion :) The ending fits well with the tone of the series although a lot of people were unhappy about it, but the movie sequel helps somewhat.\nBrotherhood, on the other hand, has a much more fast moving plot and\n          \n        tighter storyline. The characters aren't as well developed, but there are much more characters in this series (some, like General Armstrong, are totally badass, others, like the chimeras whose names I can't remember, kinda blend into the scenery but are still kinda cool). The ending is also much happier and more satisfying in this series :)\nSo if you like something dark with lots of character development, watch the original.

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    This is the anime that has been hyped up as the godsend. Number 1 on the website. The pinnacle of anime. So of course I was excited to finally get around to this one on my long list. But personally, I don't think it was worth all the hype. I'm not somebody who has seen 500 animes or anything, but I do not see why this has so many 10s across the board.\nSlight spoilers ahead\nStory: 7\nI enjoyed the story. It was entertaining, for the most part. However, I think it dragged at points. For example, the old movie gag of how Yoki met Elric went\n          \n        on waaaaay too long, and took up a decent chunk of the episode. And multiple other points where when the block came up saying it was the commercial, I sat wondering \"really, I felt like it was longer\". Part of that could come from be binge watching and feeling all the episodes blend, but it happened on multiple occasions. What felt like 20 minutes was really 10. It was also a pretty typical story, fighting the big bad who thinks he's god. Didn't really start out that way, but that's what it became later into the story for sure.\nArt: 8 \nThe art was fine, except for the CGI that I honestly thought looked like trash. The biggest culprit being dino Envy. It makes it even worse when it's a scene where the CGI character is paired up across from all the normal animation. It just looks so awkward and out of place. But I did like the thick borders they would do in some action scenes, added weight in my opinion. So the rest of it was spot on, but screw dino Envy.\nSound: 10\nNo complaints. I thought the sound was fine, the soundtrack played right when it was needed. And the openings and endings, most of them have to end up on my playlist. Good all around. Voice actors were right on the money.\nCharacters: 7\nThe goal of getting back the brothers' bodies just seemed weird to me. Not in Alphonse's case, because he actually lost his body. But every time Ed brought up how this was to get \"our\" bodies, I wondered why he included himself. I mean, I understood what he was going for. But I still didn't see a reason for him to be able to group himself with his brother who can't even sleep at night. They were on two ends of the spectrum to me, and it was, I don't know if insulting is the right word, but kind of off that Edward would include himself in the same comparison of losing his body. The same when it would be judged if he were human or not, when it's very clear he is (the same not being able to be said for his brother). This pulled me out of most scenes where these kinds of conversations occurred.\nRoy Mustang was an excellent character, and I enjoyed his entire arc. You could really feel the struggles he was going through; I just wish he was around more often.\nSome of the side characters felt pretty tacked on, but some were great. For example, the little girl. When danger occurred, it pulled me out of the scene because I knew that nothing bad was really going to happen to her (and if it did, the story would have so much respect from me, not that I wish death on her). However, Scar on the other hand was great for invoking thought, in the characters and in the viewer.\nEnjoyment - 7\nI was hooked for the first 15-20 episodes. Every episode felt like something going down, something bad. However, I think the show peaked with \"the lighter scene\" to avoid spoilers. Everything after that felt downhill (not to the toilets, but nothing roped me in like my first time seeing that scene). The series seemed like a ton of build up for something big and ended up not being all that much in my opinion. The final fight being more lackluster than would be expected given the circumstances. It was enjoyable, but nothing jaw-droppingly amazing.\nOverall- 7\nI enjoyed FMA:B. I think it was a good show. However, I do not see the hype in it. It felt like another typical shounen anime. And I like my shounen anime, there is nothing wrong with that for me. But it was not the end all be all anime I expected given its high praise."},

The lightening from the alchemy is drawn very well and the character models are very original, instead of having the normal triangle shaped face with the sharp chins in most anime's, FMA brotherhood go's for more of a realistic art style for the character models that is very appealing and nice the see a change in character models for a change.\nArt- 10/10\nSound- The sound in FMA brotherhood is some of the best sound effects i have ever heard in an anime, it could be the lightening sounds from when they use their alchemy or when someone get punched in the face, all of it sounds very convincing and very very top notch.\nSound-10/10\nCharacters- One thing that i do believe is better than the story is the characters. The characters are the biggest stand out for me, all of them are very relatible and are very fun to see in the show. There is the stubborn kid who does not give up on what he wants, the naive brother and so much more characters that i will not tell any of the names. It is very hard to tell some of the characters of the show without telling any spoilers and this is definitely an anime you want to watch with absolutely no spoilers. That being said this anime has my favorite characters of any anime so far and on another note the English dubs are some of the best i have heard as well.\ncharacters 10/10\nEnjoyment- ah it still gets me a little sad to think that i actually finished it, i have never gotten this much enjoyment from an anime and you will not be disappointed either.\nEnjoyment 10/10\nOverall- Overall this is going to be without a doubt one of the best anime's that you will ever see, the story is interesting, original and compelling. Art is also original and very well detailed. Sound is top notch and very nice to listen to. Characters are the biggest strong point in this anime with great relatable characters that you get attached to very quickly. The enjoyment is great and getting close to the end of the epic story you realize that you don't want it to be over. Overall everything in this anime is top notch and you will not want it to be over \nOverall- 10/10               \n        "},

I had watched the original series a few years ago and enjoyed it, but I didn't think that it was the greatest series in the world. However, the characters in the show stuck with me like few ever have. I was eager to see how FMA Brotherhood lived up to the original-and it surpassed it. This anime does everything right-a great plot that is intricately woven and resolves everything, terrifying villains, breathtaking action sequences, drama, humor, joy- It does it all perfectly. I am normally one that enjoys more obscure and unpopular anime as I grow older,\n          \n        but this somehow eked it's way into one of the top 5 best anime I have ever watched. A required view for all anime fans.\n        "},

It's an anime that totally changed my outlook on life. I believe many people were hit in the heart because of it. It's not like any anime out there. I'm not comparing okay? I'm simply saying that it's different, that it gives a different vibe. It balances everything. \nI really love this anime. Why? I don't know. It's just so perfect.

It was too long.\n   Honestly, all the anime's best moments could have fit in half as many episodes, easily. The other half of the show (the ones it could do without) is composed of abundant violence, which unfortunately pales in comparison with mainstream shonen.\n   If you're easily bored, or impatient this might not be for you.\n   But I know there are\n          \n        some of you out there, who think 64 episodes is nothing. \n   In short, if you can bring yourself to watch it, watch it.  \n        "},

As I said with the first series, how can you not sympathize with two boys missing their mother?\nAlthough the beginning feels a little rushed, it does make sense not to dwell too much on the events we already saw in the first version.  Subtle differences make the recap worth it.\nWith strong characters like Winry, Hawkeye, Lan Fan, and Major General Armstrong, you can really tell that this series is written by a woman.  Winry is far more independent, and actually involved in the plot instead of just tagging along.  None of them are your typical damsel in distress, or even\n          \n        magical girl.  They also prove that normal folks can be even more badass than alchemists.\nAs noted by Vic and Caitlin, if the first series had its dark moments, Brotherhood was kind of like \"so how dark can we get?\"  I do not recommend eating while watching the final battle.\nI am a shameless Ed/Winry shipper, and while the manga still delivers more, Brotherhood gives me some great moments.  I have a bone or two to pick with some English translations (\"She's a good honest girl.  Take good care of her\" =/= \"That's a nice honest friend you've got there.  Make sure you both take good care of her\"), but episodes 22, \"Backs in the Distance\" pulls some lines and animation straight from the manga, and I'm more than satisfied with that.\n        "},

This comes partly from the fact that the anime was made by a great array of experienced animators, and partly from the story being carbon copied from the manga (Not a bad thing!)\n-- Story: 9 --\nBrotherhood is meant to be a remake of the Original FMA to fix up its mistakes and follow the manga, which means the story isnt all action based, which is a good change of direction.\nThe story is quite fast paced, but that isnt a bad thing, as it\n          \n        doesnt lose track of anything or fail to explain anything, which in turn makes the pacing in the end, perfect for the series.\nHowever, I could not come to enjoy the story fully (hence, the 9), due to some slight clichés that were in it, but it was still great.\n\n-- Art: 10 --\nThe art direction.\nOh. My. God.\nThe art is simply top class. I have no complaints about it.\nA short, quick and simple 10/10.\n\n-- Sound: 10 --\nThe soundtrack was outstanding, and it did a GREAT job at placing the themes exactly where they should be, as well as using a wide array of different styles in the music.\nI will keep all openings in my favourites, thats for sure.\n\n-- Character: 9 --\nThe character development was handled very nice and most if not all characters had great depth to them (excluding background characters, for obvious reasons). Not many characters was simply left without a background\nAlso the thing Edward does in the final scene, just sealing up his character development in a nice bag and taking it home with him. Perfect.\n\n-- Enjoyment: 9 --\nI REALLY enjoyed it.\n\n-- Overall: 9 --\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    While many series can hold the passing interest of an audience due to novel concept or execution, create hype by playing up a recent trend, or revamp an old idea with some original magic, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood delivers on all fronts from start to finish. \n\nIn a world where Alchemy has trumped science  ,two brothers embittered by the loss of their lone mother pledge to use forbidden methods to resurrect he. Suffering terrible consequences, the two are forced to embark upon a journey that will lead them across the continent, as they experience war, tragedy, and an evil that coils around the very heart\n          \n        of the land. \nWhereas the first series focused in on a smaller number of set pieces and actions, Brotherhood roars out of the gate and almost never lets down the pace. With every episode devoted to furthering the plot arch's, the story is very focused and driven. Though it lacks some of the fun that was exploring characters on \"off-days\" in the original series, it compensates with action that keeps you glued to the screen. \nThe animation was top-notch, with many of the abilities used my the Alchemists wonderfully rendered. The world is party static in terms of interactivity, by the cast chews up the scenery and spits it out at every turn, so this is hardly the focus.\nWhile the soundtrack to the original was appropriate, if noticeably re-used, the emotional connect with numerous tracks is a testimony to how well-placed much of the score was. From the overture to the haunting, Chaconne-sounding end, it was a memorable experience. \nThe characters are universally fun and different, a particularly enjoyable exercise being to contrast the differences between the series. My only criticism is that some of the characters lose some depth due to a larger cast in this series; this being more than compensated for by a widely different and fun group, plus a better realization of the romantic sub-plots.\nAll-in-all, another resounding champion of the genre. The series is the heavyweight hitter for accessible, fun and mature treatment of all the topics it broaches, and is a must-see for anyone interested not only in animation but quality cinema in general.

I felt that character development was great, and I felt like I was truly a part of the story line. All of the characters brought about some sort of emotion, whether it was love or hate, or anything in between. There was everything you could imagine; action, mystery, romance, comedy, you name it. It was beautifully animated and there's not really any negatives that I see. I've not yet read the manga or fully watched the earlier series, but I completely loved Brotherhood.\n"},

In a world of equivalent exchange we all know we've gotta give things up in order to gain things. Just like how I'm giving up time I could use for more productive things but I'm writing this review. Or how you'll give up all your time watching this awesome anime. The characters are great, there are many funny situations, and the animation is great along with the animation.

With this rebooted version, this is not the case what-so-ever.\nThis anime is action packed, fantastic storyline, and one of the most emotional animes I have seen so far (I cried A LOT).

The art was impressive, though both beginning and ending themes are too high pitch, but still decent.

You quickly become engrossed into this world as you learn about the characters, the struggles that they each go through and how they change. This spotlight isn't just reserved for the \"main\" character or even just the good guys but we are also informed about the \"bad\" guys and their struggles. I was truly unable to find a SINGLE character that I found boring, annoying or bland which tends to be true in every other anime.\nThe writer wasted NO time with insignificant fillers or \"fan service\". Every\n          \n        single minute was the foundation for this great anime. The pace that the anime goes through is reminiscent of death note. Each and every episode is filled with thrill and suspense. You really can never expect what is going to happen and there are plot twists around every corner. This is NOT a \"typical\" shounen, beat-em up anime but instead is a cleverly written and exceptionally well executed one.\nThe ending is neatly tied up without a cliff hanger. I recommend this to EVERYBODY who has not seen it. If you have seen the 2003 anime, you could start at episode 14 which is when the story takes a turn\n"},
