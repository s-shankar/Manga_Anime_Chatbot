    Ok, so this will be my first review for MAL. I've written for other resources but haven't done so for a while, so bear with me.\
\
I've recently finished this anime, and I can say I am still surprised. Although I heard rumors that this was something really good, I tend to be skeptic and so I was caught of guard. Why?\
Let's start with the story, which tells of the journey of a traveler and his motorcycle, while they visit a long range of countries or just meet someone on the way. The actual fact is: there isn't one sole story but 12 short stories that\
          \
        link together not by episode order but by events. And yet the fact that each one of this stories manages to be deeper than whole plots from many animes amasses me. Each episode approaches a theme of society, like censoring, violence, communication problems, right or wrong, the ability some people have to bite the hand that just fed them, and so on. And at every time I found myself smiling in front of the screen while realizing how superbly intelligent each of the episodes plot was. In resume, each of them is really well constructed, some exceeding the others, and you need 'keen eye' to get every aspect of them.\
There is a wide range of characters as expected from an anime that tells about travels over a world. While some of them are forgettable, some of them also stay in your mind. But the fact is, they are there to be a supportive role to the main character, Kino, and this is why my rating in character was high. But before that let's look at Hermes. Kino's travel companion. A Motorad, in short a motorcycle that talks. While I found this odd at first I grew found of the bike. He (it's a machine but I will refer to him as 'he') usually asks a lot of questions to which the main character responds enigmatically most of times, he his kino's closest thing that can be called a friend and it's interesting to see how they interact. It was an interesting choice for a supportive role. Finally, Kino. Kino is the best character I've seen in a while and one of the best overall. I can't think of any character to make a comparison because I don't remember ever seeing a character like her. Calm, intelligent, skillful, sometimes unreadable, extremely wise for someone so young and still as capricious as a child could be. Though not fond of killing, will do so if necessary without felling remorse. An unique character that I enjoyed to watch throughout the whole anime, and if considered alone would deserve 10.\
Animation wise, Kino's Journey is extremely solid. It kept the art quality throughout the whole anime, something I praise. Although the majority of supporting characters have an ordinary design, this being the downside, some of them exceed in this aspect. As does Kino. Movement is very fluid, each frame seems carefully drawn and the backgrounds are outstandingly well donen also. One thing I thought interesting and enjoyed was thing the interlaced video. Which gives the anime a different feel from any other.\
As for Sound, voice actors do a good job in overall, Kino's VA does even better. The background music is practically inexistent, this would be thought as a bad thing, but in this particular case it is not. Not even once in the whole series did I fell it lacked music in any situation. It's 'almost' absence gives the plot an even more serious look, keeping views attention more centered in it, while using sometimes a tone from a single instrument to denote a particular scene. Lastly the opening and ending theme. In one word, superb. They fit Kino's Travels like a glove. The opening theme has become one of my all time favorites and the ending is very good as well and it's actually performed by Kino's VA.\
Enjoyment is probably the thing I appreciate in any anime, and the thing that will variate more from person to person. So how did Kino do enjoyment wise? 10/10. Perhaps my initial skepticism helped but the truth is even if I hadn't been skeptic, I probably would not rate differently. Kino no Tabi brought me to many smiles to be rated otherwise. It is something I will re watch and probably discover things that missed my 'eye' on the first watch\
Overall Kino no Tabi is very artistic, intelligent, surprising, and approaches a variety of themes, that always create discussion withing societies in a cold and sometimes brutal way, that leaves you glued to the chair with eyes fixed on the screen, and perhaps like me smiling unconsciously as I joined each plot line realizing how intelligent they where. Do not wait long to watch this. The only people to which I wouldn't recommend this, are perhaps to a younger audience or people who don't enjoy to think much during an anime.\
\
That was long :). Well if you read it through, feel free to give me feedback. It's all ways good to improve this or further reviews.\

    Kino's Journey is a collection of societal parables, told through the eyes of a wanderer who visits countries and observes them.  Kino, the main character, takes a somewhat prime directive stance toward the civilizations, although she is sometimes coaxed to interfere out of compassion.\
The show is a collection of parables, and as such, the societies it portrays are exaggerated portraits of a certain societal trait.  It's possible that some viewers will feel as if they're being beaten over the head with the moral on some of the episodes.  As for me, I thought that it was refreshingly straightforward, and had no problem\
          \
        accepting it for what it was: a story.\
Although the show is frequently dark, exploring the depths of mankind's ruthlessness and stupidity, there was a core of hope to the show.  A message that, looking out at the world around us, and looking in at human resilience in even the worst of societies, you can't help but have hope for the world.\
Excluding the few actiony episodes, the show generally keeps a slow, contemplative tone, and a pace to match it.  I imagine that this will lose some people who are looking for something faster and with more bang.\
This show is one of my favorites, and stands out as an incredible testament to the power of the medium.\

    What do you say about an anime that is just about a traveler, journeying to different countries on the back of her talking motorcycle.  Sounds boring, right?  WRONG!!!  This episodic anime, through odd little stories and dialogue, actually explores different aspects of human nature, in one of the most unique ways I have ever seen.\
There is little to no character development, but in this kind of story, there is no need.  There is one episode that gives the back story to Kino, and that was enough.\
The different countries Kino visits, and the people Kino encounters will make you cry, will enrage\
          \
        you, and at times disgust you.  But, while it's making you run the gammit of emotions, it will make you stop and ask \"What if?\"  The episodes each have great lessons to teach, without throwing propoganda in your face or preaching to you.\
The animation is clean and beautiful.  The colors are not bright and vibrant, but to me, it makes this anime seem a little more realistic.  The music is beautiful, and at different times, enhances the emotions of this beautiful anime.  I adored this anime, and I'm looking forward to watching the movie.  Definitely one for the \"slice of life\" anime lovers. ^_^\

    *This Review may contain spoilers*\
This is Kino's Journey? I'd rather stay at home.\
What many people believe to be a great series, Kino's Journey is a collection of short stories revolving around different countries, customs, traditions and beliefs. The main character Kino travels to these countries with her talking motorcycle pal Hermes, and together they observe the world through outside perspectives.\
In fact, its almost as if Kino is nothing more than a representation of the viewer. Kino does nothing but observe....ever. She never interferes or judges or saves, when she so easily could. She does nothing but watch the people of these countries act like morons,\
          \
        much like the viewer is forced to.\
Due to this, unfortunately the feelings of helplessness and despair sets in and gets comfortable for the entirety of the series.\
I was amazed at the stupidity of it all. I get the concept...we're supposed to feel like nothing can change these awful, horrid events...we cannot change the way of the world. We're about as powerful as a traveler with no soul or heart, but how does that translate into entertainment? All it did was frustrate me.\
For example...Episode 5, Kino and Hermes meet 3 old dudes that have all been working about fifty years...One is polishing old tracks and making them sparkle. The second is dismantling those tracks piece by piece. The Third? Well, he's repairing the tracks! Kino meets all three and says not one word to any of them of the futility of their efforts and lives.\
Worse than that, the twelfth episode had two countries at war massacring a third to decide the winner! BY POINTS!\
Kino doesn't mind. Kino doesn't care. Neither do the citizens of the two larger countries. They're cool with it, who cares? I mean, its not THEIR homes and families being destroyed in a conflict that has nothing to do with them...\
Helplessness and despair.\
Kino, however, shows glimpses of humanity both in her past and towards the end of the series. She does not seem adverse to murder (she kills at least five people throughout the series) and yet she shows a tiny fragment of pain and loss when someone she connected with on a few levels dies (due to an irrational decision to get melted rather than move). These moments are brief, scarce, and quickly forgotten when she hops aboard Hermes and rides  nonchalantly towards the next country.\
Kino's Journey disappoints on plot, but what really stood out to me was the animation. At first, I dismissed the art with the feeling that it was \"too kiddy\". As the series progressed, the style grew on me and by the end I came to enjoy the \"differentness\" of it. That is a matter of taste though, same with the soundtrack, which was repetitive and inconsistent at the same time. The opening and ending songs were enjoyable enough, but the few tracks within the show itself often took away from scenes as much as they added in spots.\
In the end, I did not enjoy Kino's Journey. The series frustrated me and did not make me feel at all like there might be hope for ANYONE in that world. Actually, there was one happy story in the span of 13 episodes, but among all the death and despair, I had forgotten it. I couldn't, in good conscience, recommend this series to anyone looking to anime for an escape or an enjoyable experience. \

    “Someone once told me that watching the birds made them want to go on a journey.”\
What’s more important, the journey or the destination? Usually this type of question requires a level of context to be able to answer properly. Sometimes the journey is nothing more than simple steps required in order to achieve something. Other times it’s the paths you take that leave the most impact overtime. If you were to ask me, I would generally say that the journey holds more weight as the journey is where one is able to grow and learn about themselves and the world around them. The destination, to\
          \
        me is a by-product on one’s journey and what they acquire from it. Because a journey is at its philosophical core a learning experience, one doesn’t even need a clear goal in mind, instead finding comfort and contentment within their own journey. Kino is the sort of person who embraces this kind of lifestyle and solely desires to travel. She is one who sees birds as beings able to traverse the land freely and wishes to follow; to see all parts of the world through the lens of her own eyes; expanding her own knowledge and understanding through discovering new people and cultures along the way as she goes on with her journey. \
Kino’s Journey was initially a series of critically acclaimed light novels detailing the journey of Kino, accompanied by Hermes, a talking motorcycle as they travel across a mystical world full of many different countries, each unique in their customs, technology and people. In 2003 an anime adaptation was made by A.C.G.T, a lesser known production company, and contained 13 episodes, almost all containing their own short story where Kino and Hermes travel to a country, learn about the people, values, traditions, as well as what lies underneath, before leaving after no more than three days for fear of settling down. The show is episodic, with barely any linear narrative present, only being concerned with showing glimpses of their journey together and what Kino and Hermes experience with each new setting. The countries Kino travels to are more like their own civilizations, completely cut-off from each other as shown through differences in technology, infrastructure, beliefs, etc. Through this episodic style of storytelling, Kino’s Journey manages to showcase different aspects of society and the human condition in each episode, providing enough ‘food for thought’ to keep viewers intrigued about the different societies and how they came to be. It is a very philosophical show despite never going in-depth with the themes present. However, I see this as a strength in regards to the way Kino’s Journey executes each of its themes.\
The main thing to understand when watching Kino’s Journey is that viewers are put in the position of observers alongside Kino and Hermes, who are also merely observing what happens around them with a neutral perspective. At the start of every episode, we are given a fairly rudimentary view at the setting and the people within it, each with their own distinct features and mysterious backstory. From there, our main characters ask questions that aim to bring light to the history of this country and/or citizens that help highlight the themes of each episode before unravelling the underlying reasons why certain things are the way that they are. The themes from these countries include societal elements such as religion, morality, communication, violence, etc. that while exaggerated, do contain a sense of realism to them, making each country seem more like an unnerving dystopia than just a simple place to visit. The way these elements are portrayed are never overly optimistic or pessimistic, instead I believe that Kino’s Journey accurately portrays these universal truths. It’s a presentation choice that can easily turn viewers away from the series, purely being seen as lazy writing if done poorly, but here it is arguably the show’s greatest feat: leaving each story open-ended with minimal explanation allows viewers to immerse themselves in the philosophical concepts presented and freely interpret what the core messages are behind each episode. There’s nothing here that feels forced and is in my eyes a show that respects the audience enough to tell an engaging story enjoyed on the surface, yet provide an abundance of thoughtful discussion for die-hard fans of the series.\
The numerous locations Kino’s Journey takes place at are an important part of conveying the themes present in this show, but this show is more than just Kino and Hermes travelling to uncertain worlds in my eyes. To me, Kino’s Journey is primarily concerned about looking at the essentials believed to make up humanity. It’s an anime that, while exposes the dangers societies can face, ultimately aims to find answers to who we are as human beings, the challenges and tribulations which stem from life and the issues that may come as a result. While not every episode involves a new country, it does reveal a new shade of humanity, whether good or bad. The show tells us in the beginning that “The world is not beautiful” and it does not shy away of showing terrible pasts and heinous acts. And with each terrible event it seems as though Kino is always questioning the philosophy behind it all, yet never makes wholly assumptions based off them. Kino, despite how many times she may have seen similar cases of awful deeds, remains sceptical of everything and everyone. And with this trait, numerous questions arise about how circumstances may be flawed, but gives little comments on how these problems could be solved. No matter how dark the show gets, it never overpowers what you’re watching or hinder one’s enjoyment. Alongside the morbid subject matter, Kino’s Journey offers some light-hearted and uplifting events spread across the 13 episodes, balancing out the darker themes present throughout, and gives the show elements of hope. Never before have I seen an anime offer so many dense questions about philosophical, ethical and moral dilemmas associated with human nature so effortlessly, and it made re-watching the series all the more rewarding.\
Because Kino’s Journey is episodic, it’s rather difficult for me to be specific about the different themes, questions and messages provided in this show. Because of this, I’ve decided that I’ll go over some of my thoughts for each story and what I interpreted from it. And with respect to Kino’s take on travelling, I shall restrict each part to only a few sentences. Warning: Many spoilers will be here so if you don’t want to know what exactly happens in Kino’s Journey I encourage you to skip this part of the review. With that said, here are my thoughts:\
****************SPOILERS****************\
1 – Land of Visible Pain: If human could hear each other’s thoughts, wouldn’t they grow closer? Actually, it caused the opposite; dissension and separation. Peace with all was not achieved when all privacy was lost. No one can completely love everything about someone – there’s always conflict, we are all individuals, after all. But it’s the relationships that can appreciate each other in spite of these conflicts that remain strong through any kind of tribulation.\
2 – A Tale of Feeding Off Others: More like a tale of a traveller among wolves in human flesh. These people have committed heinous acts, but if what they said about their families are true, they are still human beings with some sense of morality among them. Yet an experienced traveller like Kino has probably faced situations like this before, and she still chose to help them survive, sacrificing rabbits whose death she acknowledges were in vain. Humans have as much potential to hurt each other as they do to help.\
3 – Land of Prophecies: This episode covers four related stories: first a town where the apocalypse is believed to be upon us, followed by a place that wants so desperately to belong they base their culture on it, then we see a land whose unintentional connection to a past town seems concerning, before witnessing the result of this; destruction. The episode focuses heavily of beliefs and religion, specifically the fanatic side of it all. Humanity is gullible, attaching itself to beliefs no matter how incredibly off their interpretation of it all is. Context is everything.\
4 – Land of Adults: It’s Kino’s backstory. There’s more to life than this dreary world made up by working adults, and people know that, but they’re afraid of never experiencing everything they could want. And thus, someone decided it would be better if that ambitious mentality was excised out of everyone, but what else was lost. Hell, her own parents tried to murder her for wanting more out of her life. Everyone in that town was just another brick in the wall, and now that Kino has broken away from said wall, she is free to consciously do as she wishes.\
5 – Three Men Along the Rails: Kino comes across men who have done their job for decades that oppose one another, essentially making all that work meaningless, and a country that crumbled under an extreme form of democracy. Humans need direction in their lives to keep their lives fulfilling and important, no matter how unnecessary, pointless or pressured. Once this is removed, one ceases to have meaning in one’s life. The fork in the road at the end is interesting, with Kino’s reasoning being if they end up at a place they dislike, they can always backtrack and try the other road. \
6 – Coliseum: Kino stops at a country reputed for its beauty, she finds it under rule by a cruel and hedonistic king who subjects all visitors to gladiator-like duels. The end-result, Kino stands tall and kills the king, followed by issuing a new law: First-class citizens can fight until the last one standing is king. This new rule, while cruel on the surface, is actually providing safety to travellers, lower-class citizens; people that don’t wish to fight, and leaves the higher class’ desire for bloodshed to themselves, leaving the consumers of gladiatorial combat to confront the horrors they have subjected onto others for their own amusement.\
7 – Land of Wizards: In the Land of Wizards, one’s worth is measured by one’s ability to increase crop production, but here lies one girl who wishes to build a successful flying machine, to the disproval of her townsfolk. However, with perseverance and the help of a traveller and her motorcycle, she achieves her dream. Similar to Land of Adults, the one who strives to reach something beyond what the people around them think. How can one can human without actually living one’s life? Despite the happy ending, the episode showed how steadfast people can be in their old ways of thinking and when witnessing something they do not understand, see it as magic. Weakest episode though.\
8 – Land of Books: Arguably the most complex episode. What seems to be a look at the faults of censorship and authoritarianism on the surface delves into the effects of fiction. How one can lose themselves in an illusion, both damaging through escaping all of reality’s ties on you and a place of solitude from the harsh circumstances one is overwhelmed with. If all you could want in the world is in a book with nothing written inside, does that mean the world is nothing? We are the authors of our own lives.\
9 – A Tale of Mechanical Dolls: A woman who saw her family die substituted them for her own mechanical creations. She loved them as her own, but the feeling was not mutual, only out of purpose. But when their purpose is lost, what then? Do they look for a new reason to live? Do they have a reason to live? Everyone copes differently and everyone has their own individual purpose to live, even if they aren’t human.\
10 – Her Journey: This episode is all about Kino reflecting on the other people she had met on her journey, with most of the focus being around meeting a regarded wise man. But the wise man tells Kino he is not wise, for he wanted to rid himself of self-consciousness, thought to be the root of evil actions, however it also erased many other important qualities that makes someone human. How ironic with how he wasted his life living for nothing, and people thought of him as wise.\
11 – A Peaceful Land: A war that lasted hundreds of years is resolved through a game that destroys the lives of countless innocents of a third party. The screams, cries, blood and death goes unnoticed when competition is at this level. But is the third-party as innocent as we think? Aggression only channels further aggression despite the initial look of peace. Ends do not justify the means here. An observation on how barbaric human nature can be, lacking any sense of empathy. Why do humans fight for ultimately nothing?\
12 – A Kind Land: Kino travels to a land where travellers are apparently shunned, yet they are extremely welcoming and friendly to her. Her wish to stay longer than 3 days almost caused her death. Kino, no matter how unemotional she may act, is still a human, and cares for others like you would expect a good person would. Kino’s distraught expression as a helpless observer being one of the most powerful moments in the series. It’s a poignant end to the series yet also has a sense of completeness about it, with the choices of the people to die along with their town has this essence of beauty that’s hard to put to words.\
****************SPOILERS END****************\
One of the more undervalued parts of Kino’s Journey is how it goes about its characterization. Kino and Hermes are the only two characters the show has, with every other person being a part of their own setting, leaving all the development to our protagonists. Both leads are ambiguous characters in their own rights, however Hermes is a much simpler case being a talking motorcycle with no focus on backstory, acting primarily as the voice of reason throughout the series. Whereas Kino appears as a neutral observer all the time, making few comments on her thoughts about the circumstances present each episode and only getting involved when necessary. She plays her role as a traveller well, merely asking questions to broaden her own understanding and staying out of a country’s own business. While one may see this as Kino not willing to point out issues, I found it wise on her behalf; she knows she is only one person amidst the whole of society and knows that she will not be able to make any massive changes everywhere she goes. As Kino herself says: “Playing God is not my job”. Of course, this does not go as planned all the time, sometimes finding herself participating in each country’s way of life with troubles alongside. In these cases, intervention is inevitable, and even then she never “fixes” these broken parts of society, rather seeming content allowing nature to dictate its future. At the end of every episode, Kino and Hermes converse about what may be considered fun banter at face value but is more akin to understanding how the world functions and the difficulties that come with. Despite how the two may think differently, both realize the world is full of faults. But the faults are what drives human nature into individuals like all of us.\
The production values for Kino’s Journey are hit-or-miss for the most part. The animation is very generic with small bursts of life when Kino was forced into action, and the designs are all simplistic with a very lacklustre colour pallete that rids contrast for nearly every location. But I would not say it negatively impacted my viewing as it matched the relaxing vibe the show has, never requiring amazing visuals to keep me interested. And personally, I like the art style used here; early 2000’s similar to Fullmetal Alchemist ’03 and Wolf’s Rain. As for audio, it only helped enhance the viewing experience. The music was very ambient with both the opening and ending themes always being a pleasure to listen to. The English dub was done by Sentai Filmworks and they did a solid job in my opinion despite the lofty disproval of the dub by many fans of the series. Kelli Collins voicing Kino was the highlight of the dub, giving the young woman a sense of maturity all the time, whereas Cynthia Martinez voicing Hermes came off as cartoonish who I could definitely see irritating some viewers. Overall I don’t think it hinders the overall quality, but the subbed version is better; characters sound better, emotions are better expressed, there’s more insightful commentary for each episode, if you want the better version, go with the subbed.\
In conclusion, the 13 episodes that make up Kino’s Journey tell stories of human interaction in different scenarios, each providing its own aspect and perspective on humanity and the world we live in. It’s rare to come across an anime that is so thought-provoking from a seemingly simplistic setup and presentation every episode, and while episodes will vary in their immersion and interpretations, each story shows a different side of philosophy that will keep you intrigued the more you think about it. Kino’s Journey, despite how neutral the show portrays its themes, comes off as one of the most human anime I’ve ever seen. It has no problem showing off all of humanity’s flaws, because that is half of the message underneath it all. We as complex human beings all have a mix of good and bad qualities, but rather than belittle all the negative parts, Kino’s Journey aims to show that all these aspects make up who we are and the world around us.\

    I stumbled onto this anime without knowing what to expect. Once I started watching it, I became very moved by it.\
One of the best aspects of this anime is the story. Each episode is a parable about the darker side of human nature, especially when it comes to being heartless and ignorant. These parables are based on scenarios that could actually exist in the real world and make the viewer think about their personal ethics as well as the ethics of others. Yet, despite the hard truths, there is an element of hope that comes from the anime's main character, Kino.\
Kino has become my number\
          \
        one favorite female protagonist in anime. As  I progressed with the series, I found myself admiring how swiftly she could defend herself with a gun, how considerate she was of others, and how resilient and wise she was for her age. She teaches the anime's ultimate lesson, which is that if you are conscious of your identity, actions, and the world around you, then you can survive any bad stuff life throws at you and maybe make a positive difference in someone's life.\
When it comes to the art, it is good, but nothing too special. The art has its moments of beauty, like when Kino stares up at the night sky or is in a field of flowers. Other than that, it doesn't play a significant role on the impact of the anime. Meanwhile, the sound provides a meditative atmosphere for the viewer to chew on certain events, thoughts, and morals.\
Overall, this was a fantastic anime that shows how poignant the medium can be. If you want an anime that makes think about what you are watching, then I recommend this. However, due to the strong violence in this anime, I would not let children watch this.\

    One of the biggest criticisms the anime medium constantly faces is that it merely a form of entertainment.  With the abundance of shows, especially in the recent years, that are evidently nothing more than blatant attempts to cater to hormone-overflowing young men with endless amounts of fanservice, it is easy to see why many skeptics share this common misconception.  And while there are numerous titles that break the mold and provide watchers with much more than just flashy action sequences featuring gun-toting, well-endowed girls, a great deal are quickly forgotten, destined to only be watched by a small fraction of individuals who are\
          \
        well aware of the true potential of this medium.  Kino no Tabi – The Beautiful World fits these criteria quite nicely.  It is truly a gem in the rough that many people are too near-sighted to be able to see and appreciate.\
At first glance, the premise of Kino no Tabi is remarkably simple.  The female protagonist, Kino, and her anthropomorphic motorcycle visit numerous countries, sometimes several in the span of a single episode, each of which has its own traditions and customs.  Over the course of her journey, Kino finds herself in the midst of these societies - some of which have downright appalling practices.  The absurdity inherent in said cultures will undoubtedly raise an important question – could any of these societies actually exist in real life?  However, it is important to keep in mind that Kino no Tabi is an allegorical work that, for the sake of being truly enjoyed, must not be examined through reality-tinted glasses.  Its episodic nature may be an instant turn-off for some viewers, and although it is not untrue to say that it does not matter in what order one watches its 13 episodes (barring a two-episode arc), the will to continue the series does not come from the suspense established from cliffhangers, but rather from the curiosity brought about from wondering what kind of place Kino will travel to next.  Unfortunately, like the vast majority of anime of this nature, Kino no Tabi’s episodes are prone to inconsistency.  The fluctuation in quality is most evident in the two-episode Coliseum arc placed strategically in the middle of the series (whether or not this placement was intentional is anybody’s guess).  Not only does this arc deviate from the standard episodic format, it is, arguably, not nearly as philosophically meaningful as the rest of the stories presented.  While the arc does give the writers the opportunity to showcase the abilities of the highly skilled yet passive Kino through intense fight sequences, something that was undoubtedly in high demand after her expert marksmanship and competency with knives are revealed, it felt horribly out of place and negatively impacted the slow but consistent pacing of the rest of the series. \
Despite the lack of an overall sense of direction and consequently, a coherent storyline, Kino no Tabi fortunately does not suffer from the inability to connect and incorporate its many tales into an overarching theme.  As Kino travels throughout the world and becomes acquainted with the people who inhabit it, it becomes clear that each of her encounters is essentially a separate journey into the labyrinth that is the human psyche to explore one of the many elements that make it up.  The issues touched upon in the series range from the inherent pugnacious and competitive nature of humanity to the true purpose of altruism; from the tendencies of humans to blindly believe in prophecies to the consequences of not having a self-conscious.  \
While there are a number of series that boast profound symbolism and powerful messages, only a small fraction actually manages to convey them effectively through their incorporation into the plot.  Kino no Tabi’s success in performing such a difficult task lies in its subtlety.  An unobservant viewer could easily sit through all 13 episodes and see nothing more than a biker girl traveling to different countries and meeting new people.  However, at the same time, the ideas conveyed in the series are clear enough that one does not have to be a literature or film major in order to identify and comprehend them.  In that regard, Kino no Tabi succeeds in reaching the middle ground that even some famous literary works struggle to attain.\
In philosophical works such as Kino no Tabi, characters often take a backstage role and are sometimes even demoted to serve only as plot devices.  Although it is clear that neither Kino nor Hermes, the only two reoccurring characters, is the main focus of the series, together they play an integral role in its success.  In terms of being a likeable character, Kino’s apparent indifference is perhaps her biggest strength and flaw at the same time.  Kino constantly insists that she is merely a traveler and, as such, will not interfere with the internal affairs of any of the countries she visits.  While it may be quite frustrating to witness Kino’s inaction in the face of imminent disaster, it is, ironically, also this complete personal detachment from the world around her that makes her quite realistic and likeable.  In a medium plagued with hot-headed protagonists with a one-sided sense of justice, Kino stands out as a truly unique character.  \
However, the decision to sculpt Kino into such an apathetic individual was clearly not motivated by the fact that it would make her unique.  More often than not, anime that attempt to explore philosophical or social issues are prone to something known commonly as author’s bias – the writers may inadvertently implant their own values and views into the minds of the characters.  Thanks to Kino’s impartiality, the problem of author’s bias is eliminated completely, allowing the viewer to draw his or her own conclusions about the many issues highlighted throughout the series.        \
Hermes, Kino's talking motorcycle, acts as the perfect companion to his owner.  Not only are his conversations with Kino thoroughly enjoyable to listen to due to the occasional humour, they also allow for further thematic exploration.  In addition, considering the underlying theme of the series is the nature of humanity, his presence as a non-human makes their discussions even more interesting.\
For a series made nearly 10 years ago, Kino no Tabi's animation quality is impressive.  While the character design is quite plain, the animation itself is surprisingly fluid for its time, especially during the Coliseum fight scenes where there is a great deal of character movement.  Given the nature of the series, the scenery is constantly changing, sometimes even multiple times in the span of a episode.  The environment designs are simplistic yet strikingly beautiful at the same time.  Kino's travels bring her to countless different cities, many of which have unique and beautifully depicted architecture, from modest brick houses surrounded by picturesque gardens to futuristic skyscrapers.  Interestingly enough, the soundtrack in Kino no Tabi is, for the most part, absent.  Apart from the lovely opening and equally euphonious ending, the series does not boast any memorable tracks.  However, Kino no Tabi uses this to its advantage, as what many people fail to realize is that sometimes dead silence is the best way to make an emotional scene even more effective.\
While Kino no Tabi is certainly not a series for everyone given its lack of a well-defined plot, limited character development, stagnant pacing, and questionable topics and scenes, it is a worthwhile watch for anyone who is looking for more than just pure enjoyment in the anime medium.  Kino no Tabi may be a satirical work, but its true purpose is not to criticize humanity.  As it does not attempt to draw any conclusions, it merely aims to make us aware of the negative, as well as positive, traits that we share as humans. While there are many aspects of human nature that are not at all beautiful, they are what differentiate us from other animals and make us who we are.\
The world is not beautiful, therefore it is.  \

    These 13 episodes are packed with compelling storylines all revolving around the character of Kino who is journeying from fictional country to country on her motorbike.\
The animation is acceptable, nothing fancy but enough to keep your attention.  The music adequate, servicing the tale with audial emotion.  The direction satisfactory, a worthy adaptation that has faith in the source material.\
Where this anime shines is in the story which is undoubtedly the most important factor of any moving picture with a narrative.  Kino's Journey has masterful storytelling at its core, each episode is like a fairy tale, a myth, a legend, a lesson. \
          \
        Its not groundbreaking, its simply universal.\
Each country in this tale has its own philosophy to life, its own distinctive customs, and the anime repeatedly asks how far can you respect a country's customs and at what point do you make a stand for your own beliefs.\
The people Kino meets, the situations she finds herself in, the difficult choices she has to make, the way she deals with them and the lessons she learns make this anime entertaining and thoughtful.  Two traits that a lot of anime shows are hard pressed to find and attain.\

    Title: Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World\
Novel/Anime: Kino no Tabi originally began as a series of light novels, authored by Keichii Sigsawa and illustrated by Kouhaku Kuroboshi.  Installments began running in MediaWorks' magazine Dengeki hp in March 2000, and it is still running, currently with ten compiled volumes available.  Tokyopop has licensed the light novels Stateside, and the first volume was released in October of 2006.\
The anime itself was done by Studio Wombat, which did the animation for the End of Evangelion movie, and directed by Ryutaro Nakamura, who also directed REC and Serial Experiment Lain.  It ran from April 8th, 2003\
          \
        to July 8th, 2003 in Japan.  ADV Films licensed it Stateside and ran it under the title Kino's Journey; the fourth and final volume was released Stateside June 29th, 2004.\
Story: Kino no Tabi focuses on Kino, her talking motorcycle named Hermes, and their travels together.  Kino has only two real rules about her travels; one, she never gets involved with anything going on in the countries she visits, and two, she never stays for more than three days.\
This is a really neat series.  None of the episodes really connect to each other; they're more like one-shots, with the only real thing linking them being the fact that they're stops on Kino's journey.  But each one of these stops provides some kind of insight on human nature, or on Kino herself.  And the plot for each episode is exquisite, some of the best writing I've seen in a while.  \
You end up bonding with Kino and Hermes, too, as the episodes go on, which is vital for the series' sucess; if you hadn't been able to feel with them, the series wouldn't have had nearly as much impact as it did.  \
There is a laundry list of things that appear in every single episodes; however, these end up being more endearing than grating.\
Also, there is some blood in this series; nothing over the top, but if you don't like blood, it'll be more than enough.\
Pilot Episode: Kino no Tabi's 12-minute pilot episode, The Tower Country, provides a good basis for what the rest of the series was like, and introduced some of the mainstays of every episode.  It's not the best story, but it's a strong story, nonetheless.\
Art: The art style is a bit simpler than I've seen in other series, a bit more linear than it is smooth, similar to the style seen in Fantastic Children.  However, it's still beautiful, and fits this series perfectly.\
Music: This series barely even needs background music, but when it does use it, it's absolutely beautiful, and calming.  The same goes for the OP and ED for this series.  I went to find this OST, and I've actually been using it to help me sleep lately; trust me, this is a good thing.  \
Seiyuu: There's nothing I can find wrong with this series, with regards to seiyuu.  There are only two real main seiyuu, the ones for Hermes and Kino.  They do sound similar, but I kind of like that.  I'm not really sure why, either.  ^^;\
Dub: N/A, because I've never seen it.  ^^;\
Length: This is the one area where the series suffers.\
First off, there's the fact of episode placement.  Because all of these episodes are one-shots, there's no real order they have to go in (except for the last episode, really, which can't be moved).  I found the placement of some episodes to be poor, because some of the weaker episodes, story-wise, came after some really strong ones, and I didn't like them as much as I might have, were they placed somewhere else in the series.\
This series gives you just a short dip into this world; these thirteen episodes leave you wanting more.  And they have yet to announce a second season, though one movie has been released, and a second one is slated to be released this April.  The source material is on-going, and the anime itself only covered a fraction of the original story, so they don't have too much of an excuse for making it as short as it was.\
Overall: An excellently-written, if slightly short and kind of poorly-planned series, with characters you bond with, and beautiful art and music.\

    “Well… That happened.”\
That sentence was always the one thing that endured in my mind as soon as the screen had faded away. As the ED played on in the background, this was all that dared be present in my head. It’s a powerful feeling, a morbid mix of shock, awe, and melancholy that leaves behind a particularly special kind of impression. I felt like I just reached the end of an entire show after finishing a single episode. Kino’s Journey leaves behind great impact.\
It’s something only a show like The Twilight Zone can ever really match. When you compare them, there’s nothing but striking similarity.\
          \
        There’s always something off. Sometimes, it’s clear as day. Things are moving when they’re not supposed to. Places are deserted. The sky isn’t blue. Other times, you just can’t put your finger on it. That hasty man you just passed by seemed to be hiding something, but maybe he’s just late for work. People look at you with dirty suspicion even if nothing you’re doing is wrong. You feel as if your shadow had got up and left, but when you look down, it’s still right there underneath your feet.  Maybe everything starts completely normal, a completely average day, but something happens along the way that violently puts everything into the realm of abnormality. Whatever it is, it is clear that you are not in Kansas anymore. You’ve just entered the Twilight Zone. *Twilight Zone music plays*\
Within this realm of ambient menace, things start to build up. The air starts to move. Feelings turn into choices. Actions beget reactions. Things escalate. Then… climax. The climax is central to everything in the two shows. Ranging from simplistically brilliant as that of Time Enough to Last (S1E08 of Twilight Zone) to brutally tragic as that of A Kind Land (E13 of Kino’s Journey), climaxes are these two shows’ ‎forté. Whether it is a plot twist that so perfectly brings a new light to all pre-established context or a five-second tragedy that burns its message into memory, these two shows have shattering climactic impact and indulge in it.\
There is, however, another work out there that is also worth comparison. Ever read The Little Prince? \
Life is a journey, and the wisest men are those who have traveled it the most. Some travel it with a destination, and others without. Some who travel it have a home to come back to like the little prince’s small comet and his perfect but ephemeral rose. Others do not, finding solace in the journey, like Kino the traveler who refuses to be anything but a traveler. Some are hesitant because of what they had to leave behind, those unmaintained volcanoes and that neglected lamb, while others feel nothing but desire to journey, looking up at the birds and desiring to follow them. These two works are about travelers.\
As they journey, they meet new people, people whose eyes see different sights and whose minds think different thoughts. And from them, they learn. Whether or not those people they meet are wise beyond their years such as the fox that must be tamed or foolish in their ways such as the lands wrought by misinterpretation, good travelers learn from them nonetheless because, no matter what, the views of the people they meet will expand their own. And that is the essence of these two shows. These two works are centered around showcasing concepts and ideas you would have never even considered if you were holed up at home. These two works are philosophical, asking questions you wouldn’t have pondered on if you never went out to look for them. These works’ impact now extends beyond emotional as with the Twilight Zone. They leave philosophical impact, the type that changes how you think of and see the world.\
Now that I’ve touched upon the subject of philosophy, I must give you a warning regarding this and how Kino’s Journey has handled it that may dissatisfy viewers. You may see this as a criticism of the show, but you may also see this as a defense of this show from others’ criticism. \
Kino’s Journey doesn’t go in-depth with the themes it presents. The show doesn’t dig further to all but a few of the logical conclusions the subject matter implies. It leaves these subjects open-ended, with few comments, both stated and implied, being all there is to further deepen them. Unlike the Little Prince whose protagonist has much to say on its ideas and whose narration has much to say on its protagonist, Kino’s Journey saves on its commentary, just like its protagonist.\
Because of this presentation choice, the viewer is free to wonder about the philosophical concepts as deep as he chooses. Kino’s Journey doesn’t explain its ideas so much as invite the viewer into thinking about them, a process the show has mastered with its impeccable tone-crafting. This means that the viewer wouldn’t be forced into complicated reasoning when he doesn’t want to and that the viewer wouldn’t find himself disagreeing with what the show is trying to say. \
However, this also means a bounty of discussion-worthy material is neglected. Some questions stem from previous answers, and neglecting to provide these answers, however subjective, also means neglecting to ask these following questions. There’s a whole threshold of enlightening topics that could’ve been reached if the show took more advantage out of the biased viewpoint of its protagonist like The Little Prince. This would disappoint and lessen the show’s impact on some.\
Yet, when Kino’s Journey does attempt a deeper commentary on its ideas, its results polarize.\
Kino’s Journey is at its worse when it is directed in a way that dictates to you what you should think. You’re obligated to agree. If you disagree, that’s it. Your willing suspension of disbelief is destroyed, and the impact this show is so good at crafting is ruined. You are now limited in the ways you can think about the subject matter. If you agree with what the show is saying at these moments, then great. No problem. However, if you don’t, you won’t like some episodes. The episodes that are like I described (from the top of my head so be wary of what I say) are episodes one, three (kinda), the latter half of five, and nine. That’s already more than a fifth of the entire series, but I assure you that all the rest is worth it.\
The show is at its best when Kino herself does the commentary. When she comments on each presented idea, it doesn’t feel like the show is forcing any specific viewpoint on you. Instead, it feels like you’re talking to someone who sees the world in a specific light. You’re not obligated to agree with Kino. Instead, Kino presents an alternate perspective which builds upon the ideas yet allows the viewer to break away from. This has the added effect of adding nuance to Kino’s character, allowing us to form a personal connection with her. There is a lot that constitutes character nuance, but worldview is a large part of it, and slowly etching out what exactly this worldview is also means slowly etching out her character. Now, once we accept Kino as an actually interesting and nuanced character, we’re willing to accept what Kino says, even if we don’t necessarily agree.\
I want to point out that Kino also manages to do implicit commentary. She says many things on the matter at hand indirectly through her humanly emotional reactions to them, such as through her expressions or actions. Sometimes, even without making any clear body or facial expression, we still are able to at least get the gist of her emotional reaction through the way the scene is directed. It is through these emotional reactions that we can understand the ideas in a way other than logic and reasoning. We are able to understand them in a personal way through Kino.\
Now that I’m talking about her, I want to talk a bit more about Kino. She is a protagonist who is fleshed out and interesting to watch… but only sometimes. Sometimes, she is a well-characterized character whose worldview, motivations, and emotions are subtly apparent to the viewer through her choices, has a wide range of expressions, and who’s not some wise know-it-all which most protagonists from this genre often end up being. Yet other times, she’s utterly lifeless, merely a distant passive watcher. This happens when the narrative situation and its themes don’t directly involve her. One could argue that at these points, there is no need for Kino to be more than a caricature. She’s not important at these times. I challenge this notion.\
But, at some of the best points of the show such as episodes one and ten, a fleshed-out and expressive Kino brings a whole new level of quality and enjoyment despite the themes of the episodes not being necessarily associated with her own worldview. In episode one, Kino’s kind action at the end of the episode showed us that the themes presented, although seemingly distant from normal life, do indeed apply to all of us, including Kino. And the show does so with Kino doing something that is SO her which ends the episode with impactful closure. In episode ten, Kino is far more expressive than usual, smiling more and participating in more banter with Hermes. Nothing drastic was done to her. They just added a small touch to her personality. Because of this, the downtime before the climax, during the exposition and rising action, is far more enjoyable to watch. It’s not as if the climax or its impact was changed in any way, but the overall enjoyment of the episode was improved. Because of these two examples, I am inclined to believe that Kino’s Journey would improve significantly if Kino was consistently expressive, fully characterized, and present in the narrative situation of each episode despite not being a direct actor within it at all times instead of being used as a mere far away observer.\
Another thing of note is Kino’s backstory in episode four and the first “movie”. It’s nothing too significant, but I’m glad that despite Kino’s worldview clearly being shaped by her past, she is not defined by it. It just adds to Kino’s overall maturity. Nonetheless, I didn’t like Kino’s sudden change in the “movie”. It was grating and seemed completely unrealistic to me. I’d expect at least some gradualness but the show goes straight from old Kino to new Kino.\
Ending my discussion on the protagonist, I also want to point out Kino’s character debut. The first we see of her is a desperate side of her, stripped of the basic human need of water. This immediately adds depth to the usual quiet traveler we see by showing another more human and primitive aspect of her right from the start. We are also introduced to the way Kino and Hermes banter which is half-comedic, half-intellectual. No jokes are cracked, but the feeling of their repartee and the relationship between them is solidly established. I also want to make not of the oversaturated black-and-white they used to represent the scorching heat of the desert they were in. I feel like it hammers the feeling of hot desert far better than other methods of cinematography in hot environments. \
At this point, I feel like I’ve said the crux of what I wanted to say about this show, but, before I conclude, let me just discuss some aesthetic and miscellaneous points.\
I understand most people would mostly be neutral towards the show’s overall artstyle. It’s fairly storybook which helps with the already storybook premise of going on a journey to strange lands, but it’s obvious this show is from the early-2000s, containing almost all of the facets of that time period’s art.\
The animation is unmemorable as well, nothing standing out. It’s clear that a lot of frame-saving methods were used. \
Sometimes, it can even be grating, with the bad 2D-3D composition in the second “movie” created by SHAFT where they used some ugly CGI. I usually love SHAFT, but man. That “movie” needed to calm down with the CGI backgrounds.\
I feel like the OP had enough character that those who watched the show would be able to immediately associate the OP with the show just by listening to the first few seconds. \
Other than the ethnic woodwind that plays during contemplative moments, the rest of the soundtrack and sound design is mostly unmemorable.\
One last unmemorable aspect of the show is the cinematography and directing. Other than the oversaturated black-and-white directing choice in the show’s opening scene, I hold to memory no other moment from the show with noteworthy cinematography.\
The background art should be significant because this contributes a lot to the feeling of going to new places, but the color palette completely destroys any positive effect the backgrounds may have. Each new country has a different background art which supposedly should give each country its own personality, adding a lot to the feeling of traveling, but the constant color palette of browns and dirty greens makes all these places feel the same. It’s a big shame.\
Hermes feels a bit too much like one of those “quirky” sidekicks, those ones that make sarcastic quips whenever something happens that may or may not be funny. He eventually grew on me though. The banter between him and Kino brightens up the mood sometimes, and he is a good companion which is always good to have on a journey. I don’t think he’s symbolic of anything like everyone says he is though.\
Lastly, Kino is canonically around fifteen to sixteen years old. HOW THE HELL IS SHE FIFTEEN-SIXTEEN YEARS OLD!? This does not make any sense. I know many fifteen and sixteen-year-olds. Those people do not at all have the emotional maturity as she does, but I guess that’s what traveling for a living does to you.\
In conclusion, Kino’s Journey manages to be impactful in the same way The Twilight Zone and The Little Prince are. It stands out from its artistic medium in the same way those two other works do from their own. There are quite a lot of issues with its philosophical content and the way it’s presented and with Kino herself and the way she’s characterized, however, the show is still very much worth watching for the impact it’s so good at crafting. \
If anything else, it does make you feel like you’re traveling without making you suffer the horrible hell that is economy class airplane seating.\
Overall, I rate this show an 8.5/10.\
+ great impact\
+ great tone-crafting\
+ replicates in the viewer's mind the philosophical thought processes one has when travelling\
+ fleshed-out protagonist (but not all the time)\
+ a tonal and structural mix of The Twilight Zone and The Little Prince\
+ interesting philosophical topics brought up\
+ protagonist has nuanced commentary on these philosophical topics\
+ protagonist's character debut is masterful\
+ protagonist is not defined by her backstory\

= inoffensive animation\
= inoffensive music and sound design\
= inoffensive cinematography and directing\
-- doesn't explore its topics to satisfactory depth\
-- sometimes is structured to force you to agree with it or then your willing suspension of belief is broken\

    I was reminded of some lines I'd long since forgotten:\
“To ride, shoot straight, and speak the truth,\
this was the ancient law of youth.”\
For Kino, the riding and the shooting come easily enough. But in a series of encounters with strange places and people, she quickly learns that the truths of the world are far harder to grasp than the motorcycle's handlebars, or the grips of the revolver.\
Kino's world is an attractive wash of natural pastels, with earthy yellows, greens, and browns taking the center stage. The backgrounds aren't highly detailed, but they match the tones and colors we associate with nature, and they're striking in\
          \
        their consistency and the impression of a vast world that they manage to convey. It's all lovingly lit, and the show occasionally shows off a highly realistic reflection of sunlight off of standing water or snow. The animation is fluid and smooth, with not a stutter to be seen even during scenes of quick action. The editing follows the trend of simplistic beauty set by most of the show's technical aspects, with the visual focus often lingering appropriately on items that are important to the underlying themes.\
The same could be said of the sound. This is the facet of the show that's the least obvious; what little music there is is soft and understated, typically consisting of a series of slow drum beats or simple chords played on a stringed instrument. On its own, the score isn't a blast to listen to, but I can't imagine one that would have better fit the tone of the narrative. More often than not, the series is content to rely on light atmospheric noise, such as the wind whistling in the trees, the sound of snow falling from branches, the rush of water, or the labored breathing of the protagonist. Artificial sound effects are used sparsely but superbly, with the echo of a lonely gunshot often carrying surprising weight and meaning. Often there is complete silence, and as an audience member, I did not yearn for more noise. The series is one of quiet contemplation, and that suits it.\
Kino's Journey is episodic; with the notable exception of a two-episode plot, all of its entries are self-contained, telling one story in twenty minutes. This is both a strength and a weakness. On the plus side, it allows the series to tackle a large number of themes and ideas without them all blurring awkwardly together, as they might in a single larger story. It would be difficult to have a continuous thirteen episode story do justice to the themes of censorship, tradition, the nature of kindness and evil, imagination, faith, and many others, but through its ability to contain each of these within one story, Kino's Journey arguably pulls it off. The price paid for this is consistency in the quality of the episodes, which suffer from a little bit of hit-or-miss. A lot of them are great stories, and there's at least one that I wouldn't hesitate to describe as a masterpiece, but there are several others that simply don't stack up to the high standards the series sets for itself early on. Adding all of the episodes together, the result is a pleasant viewing experience, but one that's a little uneven, flickering back and forth between “brilliant” and “decent.” Some shows are greater than the sum of their parts; Kino's Journey has parts that are greater than its sum.\
Characters? Well, the obvious starting point is the enigmatic dead-eye, Kino. An inherently interesting character for many reasons. She's perceptive beyond her years, often noting things about people that they might not even realize themselves. She appreciates life, be it human or animal, and in spite of her reputation as a sharpshooter, she won't pull the trigger unless it's unavoidable. Despite having a decidedly checkered past, she's opted to look at the world as a beautiful place rather than tread the path of cynicism or self-pity. An excellent counterpoint is provided by the talking motorcycle, Hermes. A childish pragmatist with a simpler view of the world, he often asks Kino the kind of difficult questions that children ask, as if curious about why her moral compass works the way it does.\
As memorable a character as Kino is, the series ultimately stops short of building her up as much as it could have. What little we know about her is precious information. She often wears the mask of the stoic observer, content to calmly watch the actions of the societies she visits, and not get involved. She's an interesting character because of that stoicism, but the strongest moments of the series are when it breaks down and she's profoundly affected by something that she does or witnesses. Those moments, unfortunately, are few in number. Her journey is a veritable tapestry of great and terrible things, but what's missing from the equation is the knowledge of how those things affect her in the long run. A personal note, something to tie the two halves of the show's title together, is what was needed, and the experience suffers just a little bit from its absence.\
All of that being said, we're still talking about an excellently written and lovingly animated series that raises several insightful questions about life and the world around us, and obviously series like that aren't common. Mature in its themes and compelling in its execution, Kino's Journey is an admirable venture that I have no problem recommending. \

    It's difficult to sum up Kino's Journey in words. The only  words that come close are unique and stunning. The premise is simple. It follows the journey of a traveler and her talking motorcycle as they travel from place to place and encounter many unusual cultures and customs in the process. However, this simple summary falls short of giving a potential viewer any deep sense of what they're about to see. Each episode explores elements of society and human nature with a rare sense of beauty, touching upon the addressed themes with a sense of pathos that entire series dedicated to them may fail\
          \
        to really drive home until the very end. This is not a series driven by eye popping battles, but when they happen, it's not only exciting, but makes one to feel as if they are witnessing something deeper. The most certainly less than kid friendly violence is handled with a thoughtfulness that makes it truly thought provoking rather than a juvenile attempt to appear more gritty than other series. This is less of a show and more of an artistic experience. If anyone wants definitive proof that anime is more than just over the top fight scenes and fan service and is capable of reaching the level of high art, they need only watch Kino's Journey. Few works of any variety are handled so intelligently. \

    A journey can be a pivotal point in a person’s life.  It provides an opportunity for a person to experience a new world where they encounter new ideas and do things they have never done before.  More importantly, a journey allows is a time of self-discovery.  Interacting with a new culture forces a person to evaluate their own beliefs and customs that may seem natural to them, but may soon learn they are not intuitive.  It is also an opportunity to see that there are things that are universal for all cultures.  It is this power that a journey has\
          \
        that the anime Kino’s Journeys attempts to tap.\
Kino’s Journey follows a traveler named Kino and her talking motorcycle called Hermes.  They are both traveling the world visiting country after country with no real final destination.  This setup causes Kino’s Journey to be a very episodic.  It is also nearly impossible to establish any linear timeline with no carryover between episodes and multiple episodes consisting of stories in the form of flashbacks.\
The characters in this anime are a mixed bag.  Kino and Hermes are examples of extremely well designed characters.  Kino presents a stoic exterior, but you eventually get a feel for her as a person from all the little details the show gives you.  Hermes mainly serves as the catalyst that actually gets Kino to talk but does little besides that.  Fortunately, what it does is perfect for the anime.  Hermes asks some very interesting questions which usually receive an interesting answer from Kino which serves as one of the main sources of her characterization.  The other characters are caricatures more than anything else.  The episodic nature prevents more than a brief one-dimensional look at them.  It becomes very hard to gain affinity with most of the characters because they never feel human.  The characters serve their purpose in the story, but their lack of humanity prevents their actions from having any real weight.\
The main problem with the show is that it isn’t deep.  At first glance it appears that there is a lot down there, but when you dive in you’ll soon find your head hitting the bottom.  The stories are parables that cover a wide range of subjects with a general theme of humanity being naturally evil.  Often the story is a social commentary that usually involves a society that is distorted in some fundamental way and Kino observing the outcome.  Some other stories feature morality issues and a few others attempt to tackle philosophical questions.  The stories are very judgmental; often the gavel sounds as soon as the case is presented.  It is usually very clear that one side is wrong while the other is right.  The show never attempts to present a morally ambiguous situation that forces you to reflect on the issue.  It is only when you are forced to walk in the grey area between right and wrong that you truly learn about yourself.\
The only thing I truly found interesting in Kino’s Journey is when I considered the thought that the world the anime shows is the world seen through Kino’s eyes.  Her prejudices influence how she perceives the situations presented and cause a very distorted world.  To Kino, moral issues tend to be very cut-and-dry, so the world she perceives reflects that.  The reason Kino travels is that she is unable to find a place the meshes with her understanding of the world, so she continues to travel while futilely wishing the world conformed to her and her being unable to ever consider changing herself.  Looking at Kino’s Journey this way can open up some very interesting interpretations of Kino’s actions and the events that happened, but I doubt that view was ever intended so it doesn’t improve my opinion of the show.\
Kino’s journey is definitely a good anime, but I would be hard pressed to call it great.  It is very similar to fairy tales.  The stories border on the fantastical, the characters are very basic, there are clear moral lessons in the stories, and the story itself is very short.  The main reason I give this anime a 7/10 is that it is designed to make a person think, but I don’t feel better for watching it.  The anime offers no opportunity for dialogue.  The lessons Kino’s Journey provides are lessons that I imagine most people who visit this site have already learned.  ",

    \"Warning: Kino's Journey has been known to induce a strong feeling of wanderlust in its viewers. It has also been proven to boost levels of empathy. Watch at your own risk.\"\
But in all seriousness, like most anthology styled shows, \"Kino's Journey\" is somewhat difficult to review in its entirety. Instead of presenting one narrative with a beginning, middle, and end, it presents several self-contained stories, each with their own conflict and resolution. The only thing that stays the same is that each episode is seen through the eyes of series protagonist and professional traveler Kino, and her talking bike, Hermes.\
I've seen that the show has\
          \
        been compared to the seminal TV classic, \"The Twilight Zone\" and I feel that the comparison is justified. They both rely heavily on a tasteful, yet oppressive atmosphere. They both delve into the depths of human nature utilizing a wide range of backgrounds and an ensemble cast, besides Kino and Hermes of course. Kino's Journey also often provides a smart twist at the end of each story. Still, the show manages to feel like its own unique entity, rather than a pale imitation (I'm looking at you \"Night Gallery\" and \"The Outer Limits\").\
This is a rather heavy show that is focused on the many facets of human nature. Kino's Journey understands that humanity is deeply flawed, but that beauty arises from imperfection. Kino's Journey is equal parts profound and sobering, wasting little time on frivolity. Each episode brings a new land, and with it, a new set of themes and problems.\
In the end, I'd say the biggest flaw of Kino's Journey is the length. At thirteen episodes long, the show doesn't have the time to delve too far into Kino's past. The show does not provide a satisfying conclusion, and quite frankly, it would be impossible to do so with its particular format. Still, by the end, when its melancholy theme plays one last time, its hard not to wish that you could go on more journeys with Kino.\

    Kino's Journey:\
I enjoyed the series. Since each individual episode was self-contained, it was easy to slowly work my way through it. And even though each episode was self-contained, I found myself invested in Kino and Hermes (Hermes is Kino's talking motorcycle). As a traveler, Kino visited several countries that represented different facets of society and human psychology (sometimes exaggerated to a ridiculous extent). Regardless of a country's strange or even deplorable customs, Kino would oftentimes take a stance of non-interference. And even though Kino took the role of an onlooker many times, she showed that she was a strong character that is easy to like.\
The\
          \
        examples presented by each country beg to be analyzed or at least contemplated. They are not simple stories with no meaning behind them. Rather, they are similar to parables and apologues. However, the constant presence of Kino and Hermes strings these stories together into a journey. Yes, it is interesting to see each country and whatever oddities they might have. However, this is also a story about Kino and how she interacts with these countries. Kino and Hermes bring a personal touch and a personal investment that greatly enhances the whole experience. Without them, the series would be much less interesting.\
The atmosphere set by the art and music was perfect for this journey. I definitely got the \"traveling\" feeling from the very first minute up until the end. Even though the viewer follows Kino to some horrible or depressing countries, there is a sense of serenity that blankets the entire series. Almost as to comfort the viewer, this subtle air of optimism reassures us that the world is still beautiful and worth experiencing.\
Now, I've been gushing over what this series has. But what is Kino's Journey missing?\
There are a lot of things that this series is not. There is no fan-service, gratuitous violence, or romance. There aren't amazing action sequences or substantial character growth. There are no villains you can hate or side characters you can love. It's just a story about Kino and the countries she visits. Some people may be turned off by this. But the whole POINT of the series is this simplicity. It's a series that aims to paint a wide, colorful picture of the world through the journey of an admirable girl. And it achieves that spectacularly.\

    Kino's Journey is a masterpiece of minimal storytelling. It combines slice-of-life, philosphy, adventure, mystery, and action to form a seamless entity that is unique among anime. Long after you've seen the series, you'll find yourself drawing connections between it and reality... which, I suppose, is the mark of true art.\
Story\
The box art features Kino dual-wielding her pistols, looking over her shoulder with an intimidating glare. During the opening sequence, Kino fires off a round of shots into a cement wall with a look as calm as a Buddha statue. This is not a particularly good representation of the series. While the episodes do occasionally feature\
          \
        fast-paced gun-slinging action, this is the exception, rather than the rule. Far more common is the episode which displays a quiet, reflective description of a fictional country and its inhabitants. Think Mushishi, rather than Black Lagoon. The plot development is circular, rather than linear, tending to focus on character development instead of an overarching plot.\
Animation\
This is a somewhat difficult category to gauge, as it tends to be a function of time. Nonetheless, Kino's Journey's strength does not lie in it's animation. The artwork itself is gorgeous, of course, but the animation doesn't particularly stand out when compared with other series. It gets the message across, but stops short of being innovative.\
Sound\
The soundtrack is subtle and used sparingly to enhance the mood. It's safe to say that much, if not most of the series has no background music. What little there is, however, is fantastic. Kino's Journey's OST is, with good reason, one of my favorites. The opening theme is not one you're likely to skip and the ending theme is nothing if not more hauntingly beautiful. Even if you don't enjoy the series as a whole, it's likely that you'll enjoy the music.\
Character\
Essentially, Kino's Journey has two significant characters - Kino and her motorrad (a talking motorcycle), Hermes. Most of the other characters are (intentionally) shallow caricatures used to exemplify their respective countries. With 12 episodes spent in solitude or near solitude, Kino receives quite a lot of attention and development. Her struggles, observations, and decisions are the highlight of the series. She is not merely a strong female character, but also a good female character - a combination that is unfortunately rare in anime. Needless to say, you can expect little to no fanservice from Kino's Journey.\
Enjoyment\
It's an immensely fun watch. If you take your time, you'll find that each episode gives you something new and interesting to think about. The plot never stagnates (a side effect, perhaps, of the series' tragically short length), and despite the relaxed pace, it is rarely (if ever) boring.\
This really isn't something to be missed. I'd recommend it to anyone, provided s/he can bring a certain level of maturity to the table. Whether or not you take in the philosophy or understand the complex allegories of some of the episodes, if you appreciate a good story, you'll appreciate this series.\

    Kino no tabi is an old anime that present various themes, whether they are mere curiosities, philosophical questions or even truths about fiction itself, Kino also receives several praise until these days, many people treat this anime as a secret treasure, the anime generated a pretty large niche of people who loves it, this is an interesting anime for the people and one that I would normally recommend for people who recently arrived in the anime media, even then, it is not an anime that I consider good.\
One of the points that people criticize in Kino is their supposed immersion that the work tries to\
          \
        create, in fact the anime does the opposite of it, and even if it did, it is not as if it were a negative point for being an escapist or something, Kino's world is not a cheerful and optimistic place, often the immersion that the show does would only contribute to the impact the message would have on the viewer, but the anime uses a television filter just so the viewer knows that he is dealing with a work of fiction, and also, one can not consider Kino as immersion for being a story about Kino's escapism.\
Kino rarely interferes with the country she visits, she acts more like an observer character than anything else, the time she interfered the most in someone's life was when she talked to the old man in the cave and ended up giving an answer to him, but there a reason for her to act this way, as I have already said, Kino no tabi is the story of Kino using escapism to forget the problems of his normal world, as was shown in episode 9, story began when Kino took the place of another traveler shortly after his murder in episode 4, which serves as an allusion to Plato's cave, it is not as if I agree with the idea of ​​escapism, but I think that this flaw in the character has given more humanization to her.\
This is the moment of the review that you ask me:\
How did you give 5 for this anime even though  most of the things you said so far were good things about the series?\
Fiction, as I have said before, is an art form, you create the works to impress with the effort you put into your work, something you are proud to show to people, to judge if the works are established 3 criteria being the rules, the goal and the development, in general, these same criteria can be used to analyze any work of fiction, if your goal is not ambitious, doesn't have any good development that can save it, if its development is bad, the show is low quality, and the case of Kino.\
Kino is an anime in whose author has the freedom to create what he wants, there are no water to be followed in the world of Kino, everything works from the will of the creator, if he wants to write a story that happens in an era futurist, he can, if he wants to write about primate civilization, he can, and this causes me a doubt. How important are Kino's stories? even if you wanted to deny it, Kino is an anime that was made for you to reflect on in your themes, and it is this fact that attract your viewer, and maybe that's exactly what the author wants to do with his work, and I do not blame him for it , this was the way he had to write his story, but unfortunately, this is not a good way to develop a story.\
To make a story without rules is something very simple, I suspect that the need to use this format came from his desire to explore as many themes as possible in his work, this works to convey the messages of the work, but this doesn't mean that the work itself is good, when it uses this episodic structure where Kino travels by several countries and each country we end up understanding different lessons, it compromises the World-building of the work. What is the logic in a world where at the same time one country has developed technology and another that hasn't yet gone out of the medieval style? A doubt that many people have had about Kino's Journey is where she takes the money she spends in the countries, and this is not explained in the work, in fact, this becomes a problem for the work. How can societies accept the same currency but possess a reality so different from each other? Those are doubts that Kino will not answer you.\
In my opinion, joining philosophical questions and creating a story for them does not seem to be so difficult, Kino no tabi is like a compilation of \"adult children's fables\", each episode is built for a new idea, its development is ignored since the message reaches the viewer, and that is my problem with Kino, if you like this anime, great, I hope you continue to enjoy the work, I also like Kino, but I recognize its mistakes, and I hope you can also recognize them.\

    This anime is also known as The Good Mushishi. I almost wish it wasn’t so. While that descriptor is true, its existence points out the anime’s shortcomings. For all its imaginative moments, it settles into a pattern early on and never deviates. Even the last episodes which aim for some harrowing ends up slotting nicely without breaking up picture.\
It’s almost like reviewing Mushishi all over again, but the bigger scope makes Kino’s Journey better with more apparent flaws. Some anime can make it through with a narrow range of emotions, especially if they’re short. Narrow focus on themes is often the source of fantastic exploration\
          \
        of them. By nature, this anime has a wide scope. It follows a person through various countries, each one dominated by a theme.\
This anime sets itself up to be big no matter what. The stories aren’t small and intimate. They’re more about big issues like war, fate, religion and technology than personal issues. A single character from a country may stick out, but everyone in it are mostly the same person. Such shallow characterization can work, but you need someone to react to this symbolism.\
Character’s views and reactions are integral to exploring themes. It’s not enough to just have ‘fear’ or ‘technology’ as a dominating presence in your story. You need to connect it to the human condition. You need to show how it affects the people, how they react to it and live with it. The best stories show us characters in such crises, gain their emotional punch from a meaningful struggle.\
Kino is better than Ginko, but she shares more with him and not just a similar name. There are literally less than 5 moments in which some kind of personality is hinted at. Mostly, Kino does nothing but observe. When she acts, she’s pure convenience. She helps characters solve their problems by being nice, but what’s Kino’s stake?\
Decisions are another way in which we learn about characters. Decisions that relate to themes are even more meaningful. They illustrate a viewpoint and demonstrate it. Kino makes no choices. She comes to a country, observes what’s going on, does the thing that causes the least conflict and moves on. It’s hard to remember what exactly was Kino’s role in many of these stories. In the last episode, she’s interchangeable with any passer-by. Nothing about her is important to that story, only her role.\
That’s a problem you encounter with shitty role-players. A character is far more than their little role. If characters are symbolic of human beings, then human beings have various roles depending on who you ask. Even a soldier trapped in the army will have more roles than just a soldier. He’ll be someone’s good friend, perhaps the commander’s most hated and so on. Kino is defined only by her role as a traveler and does nothing else.\
A role can be a part of the personality, but we need to see how Kino views traveling. A soldier can be patriotic or just in it for the money. Both are different takes on the same role that leads to different characters even if they do the same thing and come from the same background. The anime never provides a view about traveling. There’s something vague about how the world is both ugly and beautiful and this grey area is appreciated, but what else? What do we do about the grey?\
Grey areas are difficult and I don’t expect answers, but great storytellers show me how they wrestle with the themes. If you can’t answer any questions – and you shouldn’t, because there are no definitive answers – at least throw something. A question shouldn’t drag itself for 10 episodes. The series barely asks a question, let alone provides angles to look at it. Asking questions is fairly easy. The difficult part is trying to find the answers. That’s when you deal with the ramifications. No question has an effect until you check the possible answers.\
Some episodes provide moral choices for Kino to make. They’re generic, morally clean choices. They don’t reflect a coherent moral worldview. Kino only chooses the least offensive path. She doesn’t even struggling with these decisions. Remember that this character has been around the world and to many different countries. Traveling and experiencing new worldviews should either give birth to a new, original one or leave you confused and full of doubt. Kino acts instead like a cliched ‘wise Zen master’, viewing things mostly through indifferent eyes. It’s believable, but only if there was a worldview behind it.\
The series is capable of darkness. An early episode shows the humanity of slave merchants. Even if it ends by vilifying them, it shows how they can enjoy family and raising kids and company just like us. It’s odd that in under 20 minutes they create simple but lively characters. Nothing about the slave merchants is particularly unique, but the juxtaposition of their ‘good’ and ‘evil’ side is effective for side characters. Kino never gets such interesting characterization. In the arena episode, she always offers her opponent a chance to surrender. Why?\
The slave merchants aren’t the only memorable characters here. This is where the series trumps Mushishi. Its side characters are driven, sometimes flawed and sometimes immoral. Many of the stories cannot be re-modeled for Mushishi since they deal with humanity’s dark side. The variety in characters and themes also lead to a variety in tones. Although the series is often stuck in its ‘contemplative’ atmosphere – a style which, except for Haibene Renmei, always comes off as pretentious – it experiments with tragedy, satire and adventure. The anime doesn’t dig deep enough. It offers themes but rarely shows their complexity, but the sheer variety of them makes the surface attractive enough.\
Some have pointed out that Kino’s Journey is very obvious in its themes. Often characters say exactly what the story is about. In one episode, it’s cringe-worthy. An oppressed tribe literally admits to killing people for the sake of revenge, because oppression. At this point, it’s the artist’s critique of an ideology sneaking up into the character’s mouth. Imagine if a Nazi in a story admitted how wrong Nazism is, but they have to do it because of economic hardships. It’s a lone case. The anime is all surface anyway. The only reason to put things under the surface is because your surface is already full, but Kino’s Journey already has little to say. Such an anime shouldn’t make the viewer put effort. It’s a wise decision to reveal everything, since it prevents an unpleasant air of pretense.\
The art is decent, with strong backgrounds and decent character designs. The character designs are distinctive enough. Town folks get different looks and important side characters look like they can be main characters in their own show. It’s minimalist almost to a fault – the lack of details don’t do anything – but it finds variety in things like mouth size and eye shape. The backgrounds, while similar, capture a unique feeling. A running theme is the idea of the world being ugly and beautiful at the same time. The backgrounds use a mix of bright colors and pretty shapes with a darkened atmosphere to achieve is. It’s not particularly impressive, but it’s nice to see colors that fit the themes.\
Kino’s Journey isn’t brilliant. Its popularity has more to do with it not being traditional, rather than quality. Some people are just dying for something without fan service. I’ve seen anime with weirder premises, deeper psychology and better art. Still, the variety in stories and the thematic focus makes it a show that’s worth most of its running time. No one yet knows how you achieve the greatest heights in art, anyway.\

    My shorthand way of describing Kino’s Journey is that it’s Aesop’s Fables the Anime. The characters do not act like real humans, nor do their dialogue and actions seem like those of normal humans. That is because it is not a story about people. It’s a story about society. It’s about democracy and religion and work and the things we take for granted because we do not question these societal constructs.\
The story follows Kino, a perfectly nice fellow as he travels from country to country on his talking motorbike, staying in each country for only 3 days. The importance behind the 3 day rule is\
          \
        that it is enough time for Kino to see the country and understand its traditions and customs from all angles, but too short a time to have any influence on proceedings. Kino remains detached from proceedings, only asking the probing questions to get to the heart of why these customs came to be.\
Kino’s Journey will force you to reconsider your view of the world through its weird parables. The writing is unrealistic and doesn’t flow like natural dialogue should, but that’s not the point. It’s structured in a way to reveal the fallacies behind the world the character’s live in. Every country Kino visits has its own structure that you can obviously see has serious issues, but during the course of each character’s conversation with Kino, it gets straight to the heart of why it is they do not notice the irony of their society’s structure. “None of our people die in war” is a very specific way of phrasing the mindset behind why an extremely powerful country and its equally powerful neighbour can happily slaughter the technologically inferior country and still think they’re living in a more peaceful world. A rather eerie parallel to first world country foreign policy.\
Not every episode gets it right though. Episodes 8 through to 11 didn’t do much to light my fire. Particularly the episode about the book censorship and the resistance movement was a complete mess. It did have the odd good scene. I loved the shot of the critics, a bunch of stuffy self-righteous people trapped inside a single room inside a large tower with their only audience being each other. But nothing came together and all its messages got completely mixed up. But thankfully the show made up for this poor run with the last two episodes being arguably the best in the series. Episode 12, the one about how the two advanced countries stopped everyone dying in war, was my favourite of the whole series.\
Kino’s Journey is timeless, and could honestly work in whatever format it’s in. Sure the anime itself works. The artwork is unique enough to stand out, stylised enough not to age, and reserved enough to take a back seat to the storytelling. But Kino’s Journey could be live action, a manga, a novel, a flipbook, scribbled on a public bathroom door, and it would still work. It’s themes are universal as long as humanity exists. You might need to change the talking motorbike to a talking hoverboard in the future and change the railroad the three men are working a completely meaningless job on to a friction-free hyper-gravitational pneumatic tube, but there will always be people working completely pointless jobs and not questioning why it is they’re doing it. There will always be people following the beliefs of someone above them despite their obvious stupidity simply because that person they idolise said it was true. There will always be war.\
So long as these things still exist, Kino’s Journey will still be relevant.\

    It's honestly hard to pick a place to start with Kino's Journey. There's so much to talk about and so little to complain about.\
So what is Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World about?\
The story focuses on Kino, a young dark haired girl and her talking motorrad named Hermes, as they travel from country to country, experiencing the abstract and hyberbolic customs and traditions of each land, staying only three days in each country before moving on to a different one and repeating the process. \
So lets start with the setting. Kino's Journey has arguably the most impressive world building that I have ever seen in\
          \
        an anime. Every episode (with the exception of one 2 episode long country) we are treated to a new country with traditions completely different from the previous one. The lands that Kino and Hermes arrive in show off the different aspects of the human condition brought on by the circumstances of each country. It is jarring to comprehend this show's ability to create such distinct and fleshed out setting and to be able to do it as many times as they do during the course of the show. \
The soundtrack in this show is and interesting point to discuss since music is seldom used. The saying \"less is more\" is something I would use to describe the way music is used throughout the show,  when music is used so little during the show, you really feel the magnitude of the moment when music is used. It really captures the crucial moments in the series.  Kino no Tabi's soundtrack is seamless and the music chosen is chosen perfectly for each part.\
The story is not a character driven one because the events themselves are what put forward the anime's heavy messages. Because of this we get very little insight into Kino's motives, aside from episode 4 where we learn about her past, she still remains a fairly static and mysterious character. Hermes, Kino's talking motorrad, acts as Kino's voice of reason and for the most part serves as an extension to Kino's character and allows for dialogue throughout the story since Kino and Hermes are the only major characters we see. despite what may be thought of a talking motorbike as a major character, Hermes is not by any means a comic relief character and offers realism in situations where Kino is challenged.  I think that character is this story's weakest point, but is by no means bad. Static characters are okay when the story does not rely on character development to present it's themes.\
The art style is really quite simple, you wont get anything spectacular from the visuals but you won't be disappointed either. The colours chosen are deliberately dull and plain. The art takes a back seat to the story and serves as a canvas to convey the more important messages.\
Overall, Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World is an elegant dissection of the characteristics that compose human existence represented by foreign lands and exaggerated cultures. If it sounds like a lot to comprehend that's because it is, this is a story that must be paid close attention to in order to comprehend it's depth. Every episode raises a heavy existential question that will leave you lying awake all night trying to figure out it's meaning, that's my favourite part about it and these are the reasons that I think Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World deserves it's 10/10.\

    Kino's Journey is unique from other amine’s that it doesn't have any of the typical standards that usually pull a person in to a show. Gratuitous amounts of violence, and/or sex are absent, as well as the typical cast card board cutout anime girls with rainbow florescent hair and puppy dog eyes. In fact you probably won't realize that the main character (Kino) is a girl until you actually watch it. The animation is plain the sound sparse and the characters underdeveloped. This is because all these things play backseat to what is the real focus of the anime, deeply profound exploration of the questions\
          \
        that at the core of humankind.\
   Kino's Journey has a deceptively simple premise in that is the story of a girl and her talking motorbike traveling from country to country experiencing it's many sights in sounds. But, like in most cases, its simplicity is a virtue not a condemnation. Each country in itself is its own universe, with its own customs, beliefs and practices.  What Kino's Journey really wants you to do is think. If you are looking for a show to watch put down and move on Kino's Journey is not for you. What it does do it makes ask deep philosophical question to yourself that may or may not even have answers. Everything from Nietzsche, to religion, to our very purpose in life is touched on and each with leaving a deep impact on the viewer. But what Kino's Journey truly shines is in it’s subtlety. Rather than going directly out and telling the viewer what to think (*cough, cough* Evangelion) each of these subjects are covertly wrapped around a story that prompts the viewer to think on a subject rather than tell them flat out.\
   Don’t let the sharp angles and simple character design fool you this show is actually very well animated. All of these things are in order to give the show a deliberate story book like aesthetic that comes off very well.\
The sound is minimal at best and nonexistent the rest of the time. With the possible exception of its superb opening song the show has very little music at all, and what there is, is mainly there less as background music, like in most shows, but to accent the onscreen action. To put it bluntly its there, and you might appreciate it if you listen closely but you probably won’t.\
   The character’s themselves in Kino’s Journey are simple yet not boring in a sense. Kino her self has particular transcendence of the world around her that gives her a sense of wisdom yet detachment from the world; once again completely intention to give the viewer an unbiased view of stories that the show tells. Then of course there is Hermes, while never boring is mostly there just so Kino has someone to talk to and to make an occasional joke. In the end Kino and Hermes themselves are the only consistent thing in this 13 episode show and one of the few things that tie the episodes together.\
  Kino’s Journey overall is an excellent show that manages to make you think while still retaining a subtlety and telling it in excellent fashion. This show is not for everyone but anyone who feels that what they are watching lacks any intellectual depth should check this show out. In fact I have a test for you. Watch the first episode yourself. At the end you should be pondering the question of what leads to more suffering; openness or misunderstanding. If you instead were bored just found yourself confused by that very statement this show is now for you. If you passed my test stop reading and watch this show now! You will not regret it.",

    It’s pretty weird how I struggled to have this anime series, but didn’t give a sh!t about it for three months. Luckily, I had to feed Leïla’s need of Anime and watching stuff, so I remembered the 13-episodes Anime lying quietly somewhere…\
Which isn’t weird, however, the fact that I got completely hooked on this tale of tales, a simple non-stop journey with a human-Lain like heroïn and a speaking Motorcycle. This anime is a Must-Watch, whether you like surrealism, philosophy and stuff or not. I feel I could tell Kino’s trips for children in bed, people who wait or any quiet person sitting near and\
          \
        who doesn’t give a sh!t about what I may do or say.\
When it comes to anime/manga, I usually choose what I want to read/watch: I don’t have time or money to waste on fanservice/commercial/ecchi/hentai/clichés material. So, if I am to watch something, it ought to be original and outstanding…Kino no Tabi had the original layout, the outstanding description. Besides, she reminded me of Lain and she had a Motorcycle: God knows how these two details may make me cheer up for Bush while he’s not even in the campaign for presidence u_u…\
The scenario (meaning the story and the way the main characters react to the outside world) was very intuitive: it made me feel like it was written without even thinking. Yet, it’s highly philosophical and discussing ethics in the way I find ethics should be discussed. Kino is constantly confrontated with her own beliefs and disbeliefs:although she may be compassionate, she doesn’t fall from the path she’s drawn to herself and I highly appreciated this about her. Thus, she may be brought to make hard choices without regreting it after. She doesn’t waste time on showing on feelings or defending a sake. She’s just a traveler, a sightseer that wants “to live consciously“. Hermers the motorrad is a smart trick in the scenario: with his annoying questions, he pushes Kino to reveal some of her thoughts and reasons of acting such this or that to the watchers. He’s also a way to discover a long-time relationship along with someone as Kino. The supporting characters are just well-written for the stories they live. This shows my point of view about the smart and well-written scenario.\
The Animation focuses more on the landscape than the characters, but it gives such a bright effect. In addition to this, the action is quick and well-done. The soundtrack matches perfectely the atmosphere of the series and there’s nothing more that I like than the ending credits.\
Kino No Tabi is a beautiful and philosophical collection of tales, which deals with society issues in a subtil way. It’s a nice opportunity to rebound with humanity, to stop looking at the world in the white/dark glasses and to feel more human.\
I loved these series and I think they’ll last on my lap like SE Lain.\

    Kino's Journey has about three or four outstanding episodes. The rest are mediocre with the occasional inspired scene or two. The draw of the show seems to be that it's supposed to be cerebral, the kind of show that makes you think. I have only just recently watched Kino's Journey all the way through and can only remember what half of the episodes are about.\
I think the biggest weakness is that while Kino and Hermes are pretty interesting characters, rarely do you get any real interest in the people they meet. I think the pace of the show is too quick. The country of the\
          \
        week doesn't get enough time to show itself off. The best episode is The Colloseum, which takes its time so much it's a two-parter.\
Mostly uninspired storylines don't help much. There's one episode in which a young engineer is ridiculed for her attempts to build a flying machine. I didn't know people still used that one. A few stories are better than that, though. I enjoyed the final two episodes, though They made me wish even more that Kino's Journey was an hour-long show. Episode 12 especially had a bunch of ideas that could have been explored.\

    If I were to describe Kino's Journey in one word, it would be relaxing. There is a very calming atmosphere that permeates throughout every single aspect of the show; from the artwork to the many characters met during the course of Kino's trip, right down to the sound and music.\
The first thing to get out of the way is the episodic nature of the shows plot. The show isn't devoid of an over-arcing plot; as a young girl, Kino takes a traveller visitng her city to her family's hotel. The traveller happens upon the discarded remains of a motorrad, a talking motorcycle and decides to\
          \
        rebuild it. During this time we learn that all children in her country, at the age of 12 are considered adults and are forced to undergo an operation that physically removes a part of the brain that contains childhood. After asking what would happen if she didn't want to undergo the operation she is forced to flee the city with the newly rebuilt motorrad (who she named Hermes) after her own family tries to murder her for simply asking.\
As interesting as that may sound, the show never truly goes deeper into that tale for any more than a single episode. Kino every once in a while will make mention of her past and towards the end of the show it's revisited in a way, but it isn't the main focus of the series. As the title suggests, the show is about Kino's...well...journey. It's about the people and places she comes across on her travels. So, with that in mind episodic makes a lot of sense.\
Personally, I was a little worried about that fact; I'm not a huge fan of those types of shows since I find it tough to really form a strong connection to any characters due to the constantly changing nature of the settings and stories. But like Cowboy Bebop before it, Kino's Journey very successfully pulls it off. Like CB, every single episode manages to produce extremely memorable stories and unforgettable characters. Indeed, you could take any one of the episodes and easily turn its plot into a full series of its own. Don't misunderstand; I'm not saying the stories should have been elaborated on or are not satisfying, they're just that well done. In fact, much like Tsubasa Chronicles many different worlds, you'll likely find yourself excited to get a chance to see the cultre of the next country Kino finds herself in. WIth that in mind, the show does put something of an emphasis on Kino's own self discovery, though, unlike most, I never felt like it was the central idea of the show. To me, it was more a tool that was used to tie things together.\
As far as the characters go, they're all extremely well done. As mentioned, the many faces you see are quite memorable and a lot of work was put into making the viewer fall in love with them despite the very limited time spent with them. Unfortunately, that leads to one of the few issues I have with the show, and that's with Kino herself.\
In keeping with the relaxed nature of the show, Kino is a very calm and reserved character, and that makes sense. The problem though is that she sometimes comes across as emotionless, and at times, melancholy. For example, in one episode, she witnesses the slaughtering of a group of completely innocent people. During that whole event, she remains expressionless and silent. Afterwards, she does ask why the people allow and are okay with this, but through the entirety of the conversation to the end of the episode, she remains emotionless. I understand why that is; they wanted the viewer to be more concerned with the current country and the feelings of its people rather than with those of a single character who is an outsider, it's just that sometimes it leads to her seeming a bit cold.\
Art is another strange case. The show almost completely lacks any vibrant colors. The most common colors you'll see are brown, white, and tan, and anything else is washed in pastels. Under normal circumstances, I'd say that sounds pretty awful, But in this case, it actually works very well as the soft colors perfectly compliment the overall calm of the series. Still, other than that unique aspect, there's nothing really too impressive and some of the characters actually look a bit odd. It's not nearly enouh to say it's poorly done, but you'll likely notice it nonetheless.\
And now we get to sound. I'll say it right now; the work that was done with sound and music is by far my favorite part of this show. The most ironic part about that is that, as far as music goes, the show actually lacks in it. In most cases, I'd be totally adverse to that, be it a video game, a movie, or anime, music is a very important part of the experience for me. The result of it's absence in Kino's Journey however, is a greater focus on sound and ambience. And in that regard the show excells. Honestly, it's somewhat hard to explain. I guess the best way to put it is that the lack of music that you'd normally hear in the background makes you more aware of all the other sounds that you can hear. The crunch of snow beneath Kino's steps, the metallc clinks and clanks as she practices quick-drawing her gun, the sound of wind rustling the leaves of a tree; being able to hear them with such clarity is a surprisingly unique experience, and the effect is more powerful than you may expect. When there is music playing, it's all very soothing and generally consists of just a single instrument, and it's subtle enough that you can still hear the ambiance with next to perfect accuracy.\
In the end, Kino's Journey is a show that caught me completely off gaurd. On paper, it seemed to be made up of all the things I disliked in most anime. It was episodic, the art and animation looked bland, and the premise seemed cliche. But after watching just the first episode, I was completely and utterly captivated with the show. So even if it seems like a show you wouldn't like, I'd urge you to give it a shot if you can, you may be surprised.\

    Interesting show! I could discuss it for a long time, but instead I'll make this quick.\
This show is a journey. The viewer travels with Kino and Hermes as they go to many different lands and see different cultures and customs. Each episode tells a story of a hypothetical society and is engaging by appealing to our curiosity. It presents a world open to questioning, and wants us draw our own conclusions and learn more about life, etc, etc, etc.\
The world of Kino's Journey exists in an allegorical space. There is very little meticulous attention to logic of the \"real world\" - it ignores concepts such\
          \
        as geography, diffusion of technology, agricultural production, trade between societies, spread of culture, etc. It simply asks a question and builds a society around it - What if machines did all the work for humans? What if everyone could read everyone else's mind? What if there was an surgery that created a definitive distinction between children and adults? Kino stays at each society for three days, and through this brief window into each society we can speculate about the connections between our own world and maybe (on the conceptual level) reconsider the values we hold in our society. The nature of the show is also relaxing (despite many dark episodes) because as a traveler, we have few stakes in each society - we are simply outside observers.\
Unfortunately, at the same time Kino's Journey is a little... shallow. This is of course true by nature of the show, because each society is constructed as an allegory and we only see a small aspect of each. But beyond this, the show generally sets up very simple scenarios that get fairly repetitive in nature - most center around conformity and how bad it is. There are fairly obvious messages such as \"Censorship is bad! Adults aren't always wise! Work can be meaningless!\" It reminds you that many animators were probably once outcasts in highschool. There is generally a clear divide between \"right\" and \"wrong.\" In one episode, Kino arrives at a society which is a silly caricature of the Roman Empire which simplifies the complex original into a world of hedonism ruled by a psychopath (who has an evil MWAHAHAHAHA laugh). Without spoiling, while this story offers some interesting thoughts on revenge, it's mostly a shallowly developed \"defy the oppressive regime\" story. The worst story is probably the shallow take on literary censorship where the entire society is preoccupied with books and the Evil Government wants to ban books (because you might stop distinguishing books from reality!) while the Brave Rebels wants to bring them back - would an entire society be so obsessed over literature? The societies can get one-dimensional like this.\
But there are some gems in here as well - an episode meditating on work, an episode about a brave inventor, and the last episode, which is probably the strongest. The aesthetics help enrich the show as well - designs of the different cities are Western-inspired, but the creators have put their unique spin on things so that the world feels familiar yet different. Technologies come range from \"real world\" stuff to common sci-fi designs to Vinciesque machines and steampunk. The colors are toned-down with earthy browns, grays, greens, pinks, and blues - stuff you find in nature. Music is one of the most surprising aspects because a variety of acoustic instruments are used to create a soundtrack unspecific to any time or culture. It adds to the flavor of the show and helps make it memorable.\
So in all, though the show isn't anywhere as \"deep\" as I had expected, some fascinating concepts and the lovely music & aesthetics built an interesting world I was glad to explore with Kino.\

    Kino's Journey is a series of sociological thought experiments actualized in anime form. We follow a traveler named Kino's experience of such experiments. Every said experiment is very intriguing, as is Kino's reaction to them, or lack there-of. Her rationalization of her encounters and decisions is very enlightening and speaks to me at a very personal level as Kino thinks in a very similar manner to myself. Having said all of that, I was still no too impressed by this anime. Perhaps my expectations were too high as it was recommended to me in the same light as Evangelion, Lain, and Texhnolyze, yet I would\
          \
        consider all of those animes to be considerably better. Refer to my reviews of those for more context. The anime was very interesting, and the second episode left me in awe, but it just did not ride the momentum of the second episode all the way through. I feel like it did not hit anything too complex or significant. The fact that I have so little to say is a testament as to how lack luster I found the anime. \
The story was non-existent. I completely disagree with the art style and art direction. The sound was meh. The two main characters were very interesting but everyone else seemed like just an accessory to the plot, or subplot in this instance. Most plot twists were predictable, at least to me; I did not receive most of the intended shock value. I was simply not impressed. \
Having said that, it is still an exceptional anime, just not as exceptional as I wanted it to be. I guess not every anime can break my top 10. I'd recommend it because it's interesting, but I would not recommend it over most great animes in it's category. I'm sorry I didn't like it. I wanted to like it. It just didn't do it for me. Maybe I need to watch it more. Don't kill me. \

    Kino no Tabi is a really good choice for you if you have an overall neutral outlook on life, basically an outlook where you are willing to listen to every possible side of the story, but don't go into any extremes of any of the sides, being a kind of traveler in mindset. The anime is about a traveler and the anime itself is indeed a journey. With that said you might end up liking where you ended up, you might end up learning something from it, you might end up entertained, or you might end up bored or not really interested in the events\
          \
        of that particular place. You may stay in a place longer or you might stay somewhere barely. The reason I'm saying this, is that if you plan to follow through with this anime, you might end up really liking some parts or really disliking some parts, and it all depends on your perspective and personality, and nothing else, which makes it definitely an experience. This is what the story is all about, you will draw your own conclusions from them and I can't detail what impact they will have on you because the impact they may have or how they will be received will completely vary for anyone watching it.\
The story focuses well on its travelling aspect, making the visual aspect of the show easy on the eyes, not falling into any sort of extreme, and the sound of the show will blend in really well with the visual aspect and it feel really natural which sets up a really good atmosphere, which is the most important of a travelling experience. As far as the art and the sound goes, they serve their purpose really well.\
As for the characters, as you are going on a journey, they will constantly change and only Kino and Hermes will be constant, but that's not a bad thing since it really fits the theme of the show. The characters that you meet are indeed interesting and they might pique your interest through what they will do and will have to say. The fact that you won't have them involved for long is something that maybe you might dislike, but this is part of a journey. You won't stay in the same place for long.\
If you really enjoy seeing things from different perspectives, this is going to be a really good experience for you, from which you can draw different conclusions about the things you saw. But everyone experiences a journey differently and you might experience this anime differently than someone that enjoyed this journey or someone that really disliked it. Still, sometimes not going on a journey means that you would miss out on a really good experience, and you wouldn't want that, would you?\

    Kino's Journey can best be described as a series of complex morality plays or parables woven together elegantly by the journey of a single girl. It is a story of lamentation and praise about the reality we all inhabit, the \"Beautiful World\" descriptor being both ironic and sincere at once in the context of the story. It is an unspeakably powerful and compelling emotional experience that has to be seen to be believed.\
The titular protagonist Kino travels around with her sentient motorbike, Hermes, experiencing what is wonderful and what is terrible about the distinct lands she finds, each of which generally imparts a specific lesson\
          \
        about humanity and our place in the greater order of nature, of existence. It is actually a very sentimental series, but it is never naive or afraid to comment frankly on the cruelties of nature or those that lurk in the hearts of humans. And still it never fails to focus on the beautiful.\
The plots surrounding each land are well-constructed and, while being only loosely related, serve well to tell one of the most important stories, which is the story of Kino's personal growth and maturation. Kino is a girl protagonist completely devoid of stereotypes, right down to the traveller's garb and presentational style she inherited from a grown man who was himself a wanderer, her friend and inspiration. She is pragmatic and excels at problem-solving, she faces reality unflinchingly and without squeamishness, she is masterful with a pistol and kills for her meat and kills in self-defense. Her successful struggle for her own survival, her life torn between desire to connect with others and need to protect herself, between a desire to settle down and a need to continue wandering... Kino's is a personal arc with many nuances which utterly set her apart.\
The art and design in the series is magnificent and is every bit worthy to portray the marvelous story and characters. Every element from the setting design on down to the palette and lighting effectively imbues the series with the deep feeling of melancholy and longing that is necessary to highlight the similar moods so evoked by the story and character interactions. Elements like costume design (especially Kino's) and architectural design are handled adeptly and even fancifully, creating the sense that Kino is drifting through a vaguely European-styled neverland.\
While the series may be less than overwhelmingly popular, I truly feel that there is something significant about it. As a story that is in many ways a character study of a significantly gender-nonconforming female protagonist, who is behaviorally gender-nonconforming rather than simply presentationally gender-nonconforming as one might find in any given dumb \"genderbending\" anime, I feel Kino's Journey stands out, especially as a cultural product of a society stilll heavily steeped in patriarchal attitudes and practices. (Not to say that the US or the vast majority of all other nations are not also complicit in this.) And it accomplishes this didactic storytelling about the true capacities and possibilities inherent within women without preaching or compromising the art for the message.\
I also feel that Kino's Journey has so much more to offer beyond the unparalleled feat I just described. Its many parables are valuable in themselves. Some may bring you to tears, and some may rip you right out of reality for a spell. I've endeavored to describe and review a series that I cherish without spoiling yourself, so if you happen to read this, please do a favor and go see it with your own eyes! My gushing, however justified and appropriate, could never compare to the experience you will have watching this amazing show.\

    Kino's Journey is a show that I had meant to watch for a long time, after stumbling across the light novel in a Barnes &amp; Nobles and reading it all in one go a year or so back, and it turned out to be everything that I had hoped for, even more surprising to me because I watched it dubbed, which I usually try to avoid at all costs. \
The one aspect that really sticks throughout the show is the feeling of dreamlike wonder at the world that Kino and Hermes travel around in. Everything in the show feels simultaneously as something part of a\
          \
        distant dream while connecting situations, aspects of human nature (especially more base ones), and a hardness of reality that create a world in which everything is relatable emotionally and yet seemingly distant. A particular theme throughout is the concept of a 'utopian society', approached on many different levels and idealisms. The show does not tear into these concepts (though it does display their absurdities often), and the part that Kino plays through these episodes is often more observer than participant. The tagline 'The world is not beautiful, and therefore it is' rings clearly throughout as a main theme, as a multitude of human atrocities are displayed, from brutality to indifference, but there are little bits of hope and possibility everyone, even in the darkest of places. \
Seemingly unmentioned before, the soundtrack really does well to set the mood throughout the series, as does the artwork, and though both are fairly minimalistic they do quite well in setting the tone during each episode and as a whole in the creation of the world that Kino and Hermes travel through. An unexpected and pleasant surprise were some fairly well done action scenes throughout; I hadn't expected the quality of these interludes to be as high as they were. That seemed to be the recurring theme throughout watching the show: even though I'd read the book, I still found myself enraptured in each episode and impressed by the variety of styles and genres that they were able to tie in to a 13 episode series. Each episode seemed to place almost in a different world, and could stand alone as a great work of art. \
All in all Kino's Journey is a series that I think anyone can enjoy, anime fan or not, for it brings just about everything to the table that you could ask for: great writing, philosophical questions about human nature, solid action scenes, a world similar and yet different to our own, and a protagonist duo that you can really feel for and relate to. Watching Kino's Journey is an experience in anime unlike any other I have been through, and I envy anyone who has yet to stumble across the dreamlike masterpiece.\

    How truly beautiful or disgusting is the world? What about human beings, are we divine or repulsive creatures? \
If you're looking for a plot that has epic action scenes, hilarious comedy, cute romance, amazing graphics, hi-tech technology, hot girls, and/or lots of gore... Then you have come to the wrong place. But if you're looking for an deep, adventure anime that contains views from multiple perspectives (different cultures), that makes you think about the world, how tragic and disgusting yet amazing and beautiful the world is... How precious \"life\" really is. How important being out in the open, being free, and living your life the\
          \
        way you want to... Then this is the anime for you. \
The story is a journey (just like Mushishi) of a young female, Kino. She has a talking motorcycle, Hermes (I know that sounds stupid, but the anime really makes it symbolic and interesting). Throughout the anime, Kino and Hermes ravel through a mystical world of many different countries and forests, each unique in its customs and people. While traveling around the world, Kino and Hermes start to think about the world (I'm talking all sorts of things, the beauty, the repulsive side, the tragic side, the happy side...) and they also start to learn more about themselves in the process.  Imaginative, thought-provoking, creative, disturbing (in a good way, because of how sad the anime makes our world seem at times, which is true) and absolutely genius. The plot explores human's (our) bad points and our good points, our best points as well as our worst elucidating whenever we face adversity. It's because of this that Kino’s Journey regards vapid optimism with little beauty. Looking at the world within Kino’s Journey and the world without, suffering is not too hard to come by. But the show says its because of humanity’s seemingly permanent ties to pain and hardship, etched on landscapes and people’s faces, in the attempts of these cultures to deal with pain and hardship through belief and practice, that that the world is beautiful. Beautiful despite suffering, in spite suffering, in defiance of suffering, or even because of suffering. So it is crucial that, in order to see the beautiful underneath the ugly, that you, the audience, engage the show with an open and critical mind, the mind of an anthropologist, the mind of a traveler. Deep and interesting enough?\
As you can clearly see from this, the anime is pretty ironic... The title is \"The Beautiful World\", yet the anime makes it very evident that our world is indeed NOT beautiful. Miserable windswept desert wastelands, habitat loss (destruction of forests), ruined husks of cities. In addition, the countries she visits aren't hospitable places, and many of the people she meets are selfish and quite indecent (human nature, it's reality). \
\"The world is not beautiful: And that, in a way, lends it a sort of beauty.\" - Kino\
What did I enjoy about the plot? I enjoyed how the anime made our reality into an entertaining anime. We got to see all sorts of different people from all sorts of different countries since our main character, Kino was a traveler. Very very interesting, but you do have to think while watching the anime.\
\"The world is constantly changing. And you can't expect it to stay the same, even for a second. If that's true, there's no need for you to go on a journey, Kino. Even if you stay in one place, you'll be able to keep experiencing the world!\" - Hermes\
The art is not like Fate/Zero Code Geass, Sword Art Online, and Aldnoah.Zero (HD, crystal clear art). The art is more of the old, classic style like Death Note, Monster, Mushishi, and Natsume Yuujinchou's art. Personally, I like the old art style more, because of how much more realistic it seems (personal opinion). The cities, forests, waters, mountains, deserts, animals, people, and even the food were all so realistic, which adds on to the worldly realism in the anime. Although at first look, it may not seem like beautiful art, the art will grow on you as you watch the anime. \
There's only one opening song in Kino no Tabi and it's rather beautiful. The lyrics to the song are along the lines of \"The sky is endless, because it's a mirror of my heart, It's like it reflects how every day changes the colors\" which adds onto the \"The outside world is filled with infinite opportunity, cruelty, excitement, sadness, and happiness\" and \"world is always changing\" concepts in the anime. Other than the interesting opening, the anime doesn't have much other soundtracks worth paying much attention to. \
There's only one main character, Kino who is a tomboy traveler. Hermes could arguably be a main character, but once you watch the anime you'll see that Hermes is really a reflection of Kino, kind of a part of Kino's person. Kino's real name is actually NOT Kino. Her real birth name isn't exactly mentioned in the anime, although it is hinted at that it was \"Sakura\". Kino inherited the name \"Kino\", when Kino (the original), a traveler died saving Kino (The protagonist) from the customs of her country. We get to learn more and more about Kino's (the protagonist) true self and personality and view of the world as the plot goes on, though we don't learn much of her past. But that's okay, because this anime is about living in the present, and moving onto the future, rather than holding onto the past. The other side characters in each village all have different personalities, beliefs, and perspectives on the world which was VERY VERY VERY interesting to watch.\
\"My interest is in the future because I am going to spend the rest of my life there. The future starts today, not tomorrow.\" - Kino\
Wow, this anime may not have been epic at all, but it's not like there's no action at all. What am I even saying... the action is not even important... The way this anime portrayed themes about our world, human nature, life/death, the past/future and the mix of cultures, makes it one of the deepest, greatest, well-written anime ever! I enjoyed watching this anime so much... I don't know what else to say. Watch it, unless you don't really like to think about worldly concepts. Actually just watch it.\
Now, I'll ask you, how do you feel about the world that you live in? Would you kill in order to save? I hope you watch this underrated series~\

    Kino’s Journey is produced by studio ACGT who created the anime I previously reviewed, Koi Kaze.  It’s directed by Nakamura Ryuutarou who also directed Serial Experiments Lain.  It contains 13 episodes and is an adventure anime.\
The Story\
Kino’s Journey tells the tale of the main character Kino as she embarks on a journey with her talking motorcycle named Hermes.  On her journey to a place unknown by the viewer she visits \
multiple different countries, staying no longer than 3 days then leaves.  And surprisingly that’s it.\
Though a simple premise, Kino’s Journey isn't as shallow as you’d believe it to be.  In\
          \
        the show they creatively make each country a community that represents a certain aspect of human society and psychology, but in the show they amplify that aspect to the extreme.  It’s like they took the aspect, put it on the electric chair and sizzled it.  Imagine a country where everyone can read each other’s thoughts to reduce pain representing communication, a country where everything is decided through voting to represent democracy, or a country that follows blind faith.  Each of which to a degree have a certain role in our world and its people which the anime displays both the positives and negatives to everything.  In this regard this is one of the most intelligent anime I've ever seen.\
The thing that Kino’s Journey is meant to teach the audience is that the world isn't beautiful therefore it is.  It’s a simple yet bittersweet moral but its execution in Kino’s Journey is near perfection.\
Now you all may be wondering? What is Kino’s Journey? Is she going to McDonalds? Maybe Hooters for a job? How about Compton or Christian Grey’s tree house of horrors? The answer to that is, well, unanswered.  Though it is unanswered, her journey is better left ambiguous and left to audience interpretation.  Nevertheless it doesn't harm the story in any way not knowing where she’s going seeing how the world is abstract.\
The character interactions on her travels are nothing short of spectacular.  As Kino meets new people  she gets more insight about each country and maybe even form a short term relationship with the person during her 3 day stay.  Also with her interactions in each country they range from leaving no effect leaving more impactful effect on the country.\
As for the ending, though it’s an episodic show I found that the ending wrapped up the show perfectly, something that I feel a lot of episodic shows lack.  It held many surprises and felt the most different from the rest of the episodes making it a personal favorite episode of any anime I’ve ever seen.\
The Characters\
Transitioning to the characters, though Kino can be perceived as bland that in my opinion is actually not the case.\
Kino is characterized as intelligent and quick to react to the dangers around her.  She also very observant of other people, offering up advice to people who have no idea of a problem he or she may have, and also ways that might improve the society.  One of her most interesting traits is her resistance to killing when it’s not needed, this demonstrates how she has her own set of morals which is something that a lot of anime characters nowadays seem to lack.  However at points I found her emotionless type of behavior to be implausible especially at one point of the story where there was a depiction of genocide to demonstrate killing the few to save the many.  Her backstory is highly intriguing as well.  However, though she has that one flaw she’s still in my opinion one of the best females in anime and I could go on forever on why I absolutely love her. \
Hermes is her talking motorcycle whose role is to offer a second opinion to Kino’s.  He’s basically a sidekick like Donkey to Shrek, racism to Paula Deen, forced jokes to this review.  One little pet peeve I had with the show is that people appear to be okay with Hermes as a talking motorcycle so I don’t really understand if it’s something normal in this society or not, kinda left me a tad bit hanging.\
As for the supporting cast admittedly they consist of some forgettable characters, and at the same time some pretty great characters as well.  For an episodic show they manage characterization superbly.\
The Art/Animation\
The art for the most part  is consistently solid and features some glorious scenes of beauty but admittedly it’s nothing too special.  Each country has its own unique look to it with great attention to the architecture of the city.  The character designs don’t break any grounds but are fitting for anime, and the general backgrounds are well drawn.  The emotions can be seen on peoples’ faces as well emphasizing fear and sadness in such a vivid way.  Also, the shot composition with the framing and the angles of the events in the show made for some pretty radical and beautiful shots.\
The animation however is a different monster, for an anime that came out in 2003 this has some of the best animation I have ever seen.  It’s highly fluid with character movements being extremely well handled during the more intense scenes of the anime.\
The Sound\
In terms of sound the voice acting is solid, with Kino having a bit of emotion from her otherwise emotionless personality, and Hermes sounding decent as well.  The anime handles something I haven’t seen handled so well in a long time, that is the use of silence.  There is an absence of ost tracks because of the silence which excellently highlights the more emotional and intense segments of the show.  As for the soundtrack I love the opening and the ending which introduce and ends the episodes in an appropriate manner.  The soundtrack itself is soothing and not too thunderous which is suitable to accompany the marvelous atmosphere of the show.\
In conclusion Kino’s Journey in my opinion is a philosophical masterpiece that comments on the different aspects of society today and is now one of the only anime that receives a 10 on my MAL even though it deserves a 9. I’d say that Kino’s Journey is Fantabulous and Peggy Approved, Peggy Approved is a rating reserved for shows I feel are one of the best the anime medium has to offer and I highly recommend this show to those who want an intelligent anime that is calming and can be seen by both serious and casual watchers.

    The world is not beautiful; and that, in a way, lends it a sort of beauty.\
-Kino (Kino no Tabi)\
In Kino's Journey, the protagonist, Kino, accompanied by a talking motorcycle named Hermes, travels through a mystical world of many different countries and forests, each unique in its customs and people.\
Kino's Journey is a very rare case that defines a true anime about adventures. An episodic one-of-a-kind, a fascinating and intellectual ride from the start till the very end.\
The animation is rather simple, dont have many details even with the background, considering the show is more than 10 years old. But it fits the show perfectly. It\
          \
        surely doesnt need some over-the-top animation to be epic. The music is just gorgeous. It's like the theme song for any travellers ever. The op and ed are pleasant. \
If you wanna watch an epic anime about adventurer, coming to lands by lands, witness stories that will be told till ages. Kino's Journey is for you. \
This anime has my highest recommendation. WATCH IT NOW. YOU'RE NOT GONNA REGRET. IT'S TOO GOOD TO BE IGNORE. YOU CAN THANK ME LATER.\

    Kino’s Journey\
Story: 8\
Being a largely episodic series the plot is easily identifiable.  It is about Kino’s many journeys through a very strange and at times demented world.  She is frequently faced with a moral question and I’ve always been impressed with how this series handled it.\
The plot is simple at first glance, but Kino’s actual background is covered in two separate episodes, both of which I was very glad for the insight into who she is and was amazingly well written.  There  was also one two episode plot halfway through which I thoroughly enjoyed as it was action packed and exciting.\
A\
          \
        few downsides to this series was that it just cuts off where I would be expecting, “well, next episode?”.  I felt it was building up to something greater but instead it left me feeling half full at the ending.  The last episode was certainly the best, but it failed to give any form of wrap up.  Leaving you with many questions.\
The beginning of the series you find Kino in the middle of a desert, how she got there?  You don’t know.  Who is the master?  You don’t know.  Well I found out why.  There is a movie. Kino’s Journey: Life Goes On, that was released as a prequel.  It apparently explains all of these questions.  I have also found that there is both a movie and special of Kino’s journey and I am going to be sure to check those out.\
Art: 8\
This is the low point of the series, the art is just ok.  It is simple so you aren’t distracted from the thoughts that are being portrayed.  The backgrounds are all simple and I found them very plain.  The actual animation is a high point.  The movement of the characters are smooth and the action scenes are quite suspenseful.  Character designs, well Kino was the only person of any real importance to the series and she looks memorable, I guess.  So it’s a good piece all aspects accounted for, just not an amazing piece of art.  The art is perfect for the mood of the story and GENCO tends to do this right (they also did Azumanga Daioh and Elfen Lied).\
Sound: 9\
Oh the music!  I loved every moment of it.  Especially the opening and ending which I listen to regularly.  The sound effects were very well done making you feel as if you are really there.\
The voice acting was great, particularly Kino’s voice actress Kelli Cousins, who hasn’t played very many roles at all but was able to make Kino a deep and at times conflicted personality behind her indifferent exterior.  Cynthia Martinez played the raspy Hermes, Kino’s motorbike (it must have been horrendous on her cords!) was a great performer.  And lastly there is Vic Mignogna, who plays EVERYONE ELSE.  It got downright freaky at times.  “It’s an intense scene and she’s in trouble and then he opens his mouth to spe- OH NOES it’s Vic!”  He's still great, but his voice sometimes just is not appropriate.\
Character: 9\
Kino quickly won my heart with her steady head and genuine personality.  She’s indifferent at times but she really does have a deep insight.  Her moral choices are unique but amazingly true and she knows when to act, and when to simply go on her way.\
Hermes was funny and an enjoyable, but not distracting, comedic relief.  I especially likes how he was always getting phrases wrong.\
Overall: 9\
The best episodic series I have seen thus far.  It is extremely unique and the author Keiichi Sigsawa is a creator of masterpieces.  This is a must own series for anyone who likes philosophy or simply a quiet show for a time which needs serenity.\
Parental Caution:\
Rated PG-13\
-Some disturbing images such as a rabbit getting skinned and human remains.\
-There are the presence of the topics genocide, slave trading, and murder.\
-Many episodes deal with some form of tragedy.\
-Very little swearing and is very minor.\
-A tiny bit of violence.\
-There’s a king who has a harem, but their never focused on and despite how they dress the art form of the series makes this moot.\
-Honestly this series should have been rated PG.\

    Kino's Journey has often been compared to Mushishi as they share many similarities, but they still differ in many, subtler ways. Kino's Journey has a large following, and it's easy to see why. Its premise is rather compelling, and it manages to accomplish quite a lot with it. Though it isn't perfect, it's certainly worth a watch.\
Kino's Journey is an episodic anime that has no real overarching storyline; it's something you can watch out of order and still understand what's going on. The one continuity that is ever-present are the main characters, Hermes and Kino herself. Hermes, the talking motorcycle (or in this world's terminology,\
          \
        a motorrad) is Kino's companion. The two travel the world, staying in various countries for no longer than three days. This anime details each individual country through the eyes of Kino. Hermes tends to ask Kino interesting questions that make for much of the show's intriguing nature. Kino is undoubtedly the most interesting character the show has to offer; with each episode, we discover a little more about her, such as what drives her and how she thinks. By the end of the show, after discovering every little nuance about Kino, we're able to see her as a person. While the two are great characters themselves (without going into too much detail), the characters that they meet in each episode don't tend to have much characterisation at all, merely being used as plot devices and not amounting to much more than that. Episode 10 is a brilliant exception to this rule, and one of my favourite episodes of the show. Even so, there are various episodes where the characters Kino and Hermes meet have actual characterisation and depth - however, there are also those episodes where they serve as caricatures, rather than actual characters. Even so, the characters that are able to overcome that are executed quite well. There are only a few characters and a few episodes when the generic characters don't feel real, so this isn't too much of a downside.\
This anime is all about atmosphere, and that is something that the soundtrack accomplishes very well. The soundtrack is very good, with no single track skimping on providing the atmosphere this anime strives to uphold. Whatever the situation, these tracks add to the brilliant atmosphere that the anime provides. The opening and ending are something that I can never skip, because they are brilliant, and I usually have distaste for any ED. If nothing else, this anime provides a great soundtrack that you can listen to, even without the anime playing alongside it. The soundtrack, while never released, is one of the best things about this show. The sound effects are able to sound believable, but not to the extent that they sound life-like. The voice acting tends to vary from character to character, sometimes ending up with characters who fail to read their lines with much emotion or tone in their voice. The main characters, however, do a great job with their portrayal of Hermes and Kino, though Hermes' voice can be grating sometimes. Kino's voice actor did her job brilliantly, at the very least.\
As I mentioned previously, there is no overarching plot line; each individual episode has its own story (with the exception of the coliseum arc, which lasts 2 episodes). Every episode deals with a country which Kino has stumbled upon, and no episode is like another. There's a great variation between each episode and its story, which is good, considering the kind of show this is. Though Kino very rarely intervenes with any country, each one has a story to tell. Each episode provides and explores an idea and has you thinking about it by the end of it, though some ideas are more thought-provoking than others. It's an interesting concept, and while the story each episode tells tends to be simplistic, it can add some complexity to it without it feeling too convoluted. Between each episode, there's bound to be something that you like, as there is a great variation between each country.\
The art adds to the overall atmosphere that the anime provides, even going so far as to add in scan lines (which is an odd choice, to say the least). The art has this rather dark, fairy-tale-like quality, which exemplifies the kind of place Kino's world is. Though there is a great lack of bright colours, it's fitting for Kino's world, only adding to the atmosphere. The character design for Kino is unique, however it is fairly plain for pretty much every other character; the art itself could have been better. The art shouldn't bother you too much if you don't look too closely, though (most of the time, anyway). The animation is fairly solid and remains consistent throughout the anime, even if it isn't exceptional. It shouldn't bother you at all, save for a few short moments.\
I enjoyed this anime a great deal. Its uniqueness is especially charming, as it's unlike anything I've ever seen before. From the simple to the complex episodes of this anime, I loved every single bit of it. Kino and Hermes were an entertaining duo to have as protagonists; watching them deal with whatever situation the creators wanted to throw at them was one of my favourite parts of watching the anime. Kino is an incredibly unique character herself, which is one of the reasons I enjoyed this anime as much as I did. This still stands today as my favourite anime out of everything else I've ever watched, and it will likely continue to do so.\
Kino's Journey is an experience, and it's a relaxing experience at that. This series tells the tale of one of the most unique and interesting characters anime has, which is coupled with the unique nature of the show itself. There truly isn't anything else like it - From the strange, enthralling countries to the simple, yet thought-provoking ideas Kino's Journey explores, it stands as a testament to what anime can accomplish within its medium; Kino's Journey is one anime that is most assuredly worth watching.\

    I simply can't think of anything wrong with Kino's Journey. Every single episode was just a joy to watch. \
The way the story is structured with each episode being completely dependent of the rest (except for 2 of the episodes) means that even if you dislike an episode, you can just cut it out next time you watch the show.\
Lots of great themes are brought up each episode, and every single episode (minus one or two) will leave you with something to ponder about humanity and human nature.\
Kino's motivations are very clear and as the audience you are never left wondering why she did something.\
          \
        You also never think that she makes decisions for the sake of the plot. \
Each episode feels like some different test for Kino, and as the audience you quickly come to grow attached to Kino's relate able personality and morals. (as well as her cool gun slinging)\

    This anime got 10's straight across the board with me. \
The Story:\
First of all, the story was very psychological. I enjoyed how the author of this series dived into the human psyche and brought out the dark side of people. Often people think about things like \"What would it be like to be able to read other people's minds?\" Kino's Journey takes those kinds of thoughts and twists them into reality. Through Kino's eyes, we see the world as it really is, not the Utopia we often try to live in. Thus the popular quote from the series \"The world is not beautiful, therefore it\
          \
        is.\"\
Art: \
The art suited the series very well. It was plain, earthy, but in some situations very abstract. The creators didn't use high detail, and in truth, if they did, it would have distracted the viewer from the important aspects of the series. They seemed to make each scene relate to human senses and delusions.\
Sound:\
Just like the art, they interacted sound with the senses. They did this especially during fight scenes. Just like in reality, the senses are heightened when one's life is on the line, and they really focused on this aspect with the sound. You can hear everything going on, clothes ruffling, boots pounding against the ground, even the breath of the one who has realized they just lost.\
Character:\
There are really only two main characters. Each character though, has their own story whether main or supporting. They give in abstract and direct detail as to why each character acts the way they act, and each character is fairly well developed. \
Overall/Enjoyment:\
Love this series. Has to be my favorite series of all. I really wish there were more episodes, but at the same time, they made the series just long enough for it to be amazing and leave the viewers wanting more without them becoming bored. The story really draws people in and makes them part of Kino's Journey as she drifts between the different countries. This series is not just an anime, it is a piece of art.\

    Kino's Journey is Quite a Trip!\
This summer has been and interesting one for me.\
After coming home from graduating from college, I discovered that my father purchased a membership with Blockbuster online.\
One look at the website was all I needed to make a new goal for myself:\
Watch as much new anime this summer as possible.\
And boy, did I do exactly that!\
One of the anime on my list that I'd been so hoping to watch was Kino's Journey, something I'd heard many rumors about, but known little of.\
This sadly little-popular series is truly a gem.\
Though it only runs for 13 episodes, Kino's Journey delves into some pretty\
          \
        deep subjects; mainly, the nature of mankind.\
Each episode is self-contained, and the only regular characters are Kino, a young traveller, and Hermes, Kino's faithful and guick-tongued Motorrad (a sort of living motorcycle).\
Little is known at first about Kino, let alone the world Kino lives in, but soon we realize the depth of Kino's past and thoughts.\
I would say more about Kino's Journey, but if I did, I'd be spoiling a lot for those of you who haven't seen the series.\
What I can say, however, is that this series isn't like any other anime.\
The animation may be a bit choppy for my artistic preferences, but the story is enough to keep the viewer interested.\
The uniqueness of the style and the plotline makes this series well worth watching.\

    The world is not beautiful. Therefore it is. \
This anime doesn't appeal to all Anime fans and it can be quit boring and difficult to watch if you are not into stuff like Psychology, Sociology, Philosophy, literature and even poetry.\
Kino's journey is about a girl travelling across a mystical world and spending three days in each of the countries with a talking motorcycle named Hermes\
Between countries Kino and Hermes discuss life and human nature on the road and Almost every place seems to be stuck in a time period somewhere between 1920 and 1960, and in a world where WWII never\
This can be confusing. *\
          \
However Each episode of Kino can stand on it's own, even when it alludes heavily to earlier stories, all the episodes seem to have no real order. Many of them are shown simply as a series of flashbacks, while others are obviously earlier in her life even though they are at the end of the series.  \
\
My only problem with this anime is  the main character \"kino\" \
she's not interesting at all you cant care about her\
There is no emotions whatsoever. It is as if she is a robot.. She has no personality or Facial Expressions, disgustingly overconfident for a  young girl \
she has the body of a 10 year old ! yet she dodge bullets like its nothing and beat everyone that stand in her way\
I care so deeply about characters in anime and i was disappointed. \
overall \
This deep exploration of the meaning of life and human nature may prove to be too abstract and a turn off for some, however i think its still enjoyable  \
I would describe Kino's Journey as contemplative rather than normative. I.e. it poses questions instead of giving answers.  \

Kino's Journey is an anime to be watched with a clear mind. The ideas that it suggests have to be comprehended properly. While it is enjoyable, enjoyment isn't the only purpose of the anime. The purpose is to convey certain messages, different ones across each episode.\
The entire story is based on Kino traveling with her talking motorcycle to different cities and learning about their cultures and traditions. That sounds boring if you're imagining a happy show where the main character is a vibrant, outgoing \"dere\" character and it's all magic and fun and games. It's not. Each episode has its own dark twist\
          \
        that is necessary to spice up the episode and give it its philosophical meaning. Most of the philosophical ideas that are engaged in regard the principle of reciprocity, herd mindset, the loss of individuality, and the most abstract concept of all: what is right and what is wrong. Being a short series of twenty minute episodes, all that Kino's Journey can do is suggest questions and ideas for the audience to absorb and engage in. It will not do all of the work for you, which is why I said before to watch it with a clear mind.\
Kino's Journey is very sincere in the way it conveys its message. It does this by being very simple and down to earth. Indeed, the best way to suggest important ideas through this medium is by cutting out all that is unnecessary and maintaining as much of a focus on the topic as possible. In doing so, the art and animation are what some would describe as, \"lacking.\" Don't let anyone tell you that. The purpose of the simple art is to compliment the simplicity and sincerity of the messages being conveyed. Here, there is no need for extravagancy.\
Due to the simple nature of the anime, there is also very little to the soundtrack. The opening is a nice song and so is the ending, but there is little in between, and for the reason of maintaining the simplicity. Music only plays where it is needed, and when conveying as many important messages as Kino's Journey, there are little opportunities where music is needed. These opportunities present themselves as areas where music would strengthen the emotional response in the audience, and it does just that. There are times where the background might seem almost too silent, and this is for the effect of conveying a clear, concise, and simple message.\
The character development takes place primarily within the side characters, and I can't discuss too much about it without spoiling it. The main characters have to maintain relatively (I said relatively) the same way throughout the whole series so that their response to each setting remains a somewhat constant variable. As I said before, there is a twist in each episode and it is in the twist where the opportunity presents itself for character development.\
It's not an anime for kids. I don't say that because there is any excessive violence or nudity or profanity, in fact there is little to none of any of this. I say it's not for kids because the ideas conveyed by Kino's Journey require a certain level of maturity to comprehend.\
Overall I give Kino's Journey a 10. I'm sorry if I seem pretentious with my language in this review, but I really wanted to do this some justice.\

     With an intimidating, ever-expanding backlog piled high with releases from the past year, the recent influx of over-stimulation has been overwhelming. Modern anime has its focus placed on glaringly bright and pretty animation, clichéd character tropes and archetypes, and blatant fanservice using “cute anime girls” in exchange for a shallow plot lacking any substance. As a much-needed break, I have taken the initiative to venture back in time in search of hidden classics to reinvigorate my interest in the medium. Luckily, this obscure show caught my attention. Hailing from the year 2003 and produced by studio A.C.G.T, the adventure, fantasy anime Kino’s Journey: The\
          \
        Beautiful World presents a collection of episodic narratives revolving around the aimless journey of an androgynous traveler named Kino and her sentient motorrad Hermes. For a seemingly simple travel story with aged visuals reminiscent of Mushishi, expectations before marathoning through each subsequent episode were rather moderate. However, the general atmosphere and aesthetic tied neatly into the overall narrative sparked my instant immersion and investment into the story. Despite being a short series consisting of thirteen distinct episodes, each chapter is able to weave a sequence of cohesive mini-storylines that leaves underlying, compelling philosophical messages that addresses concerns regarding society and basic human nature. Ethical issues are raised and veiled over a cloud of ambiguity, being harder to discern within the context of this show in comparison to the clear lines drawn between the heroic, morally justified protagonists and the one-dimensional evil villains within modern anime. Along with the character dynamics of the many denizens from foreign countries Kino visits, the show had left a lasting impression on me.  And for those aspects alone, the brilliance of this show has already proven to be well above the norm.\
        To delve deeper in depth and give a brief overview of the over-arching plot of the entire anime, the term episodic is seemingly the most fitting word available. Alongside a continuous, albeit meandering, storyline of Kino’s existential and aimless journey across vast expanses of empty land, there are individual episodes that consist of observing the often-exaggerated culture, traditions, and behaviors of each country that she visits. These societies are exaggerated on purpose however, as an astute viewer would recognize how each fictional country within the context of the show satirizes real life concepts such as religion, democracy, capitalism, war, censorship, and so on. The various settings may even seem to contradict the “Beautiful World” of the show’s title. (Spoilers Ahead) Take for example the Land of Prophecies in episode 3 that worships a Holy Book and interpreted an impending apocalypse, and yet another unnamed country receives that same Holy Book where they interpreted that they needed to destroy the Land of Prophecies to prevent that said apocalypse. Ironically it was revealed that the Holy Book was written by a depressed, widowed poet from the Land of Sadness who simply wrote it for no other reason than to express his grief. There is also the Country of One in episode 5, where the last remaining civilian explained how his country depopulated itself over disagreements through Direct Democracy with a death penalty based on strictly majority vote. Far from what one would consider a utopia, these are some examples of the glaring issues associated with every country. These imperfections may pose as morally questionable or alarming to the viewer. But as the subtitle of the show would put it, “The world is not beautiful; and that, in a way, lends it a sort of beauty.”\
        With a self-imposed and emphasized time limit of three days, Kino passively peruses through the culture of each country while aiming not to involve herself the affairs of the townsmen. For this reason, she does not become too attached and bound to any one location as to maintain her title as a “Traveler”. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that the focal point of the show revolves around the various countries, Kino is merely a medium through which the viewer is able to witness these countries. Providing a suitable self-insert for the viewer, Kino herself displays a detached attitude. As a result, she enables herself to remain completely objective and neutral in relation towards everyone and everything. Unlike other films, Kino’s Journey does not take a moral high-ground. There is no sense of “othering” and condescension towards the cultures that would seem ridiculous by real life standards. From Kino’s perspective, the traditions and practices that would seem strange and unorthodox are not inherently right or wrong, but merely normal for the residents within that country and must be respected.\
        Regarding this moral dilemma addressed through anti-ethnocentrism and multiculturalism, the show spends time analyzing this issue. (Spoilers Ahead) Expanding on the aforementioned Land of Prophecies, Hermes asks “Hey Kino. Which do you think it is? Was the prophecy right or wrong?” To which she replies “I’m not sure… Why don’t we ask the stars or something?” This shows Kino is not quick to discredit the beliefs other people hold, deciding to remain impartial. Another notable example is when Kino finds herself trapped within the confines of a barbaric kingdom ruled by a tyrant. She is forced to participate in coliseum death matches where the winner is granted first-class citizenship and the ability to add one new law to the country; refusing leads to confinement as a slave. Surrounded by first-class citizens and the king spectating her match demanding for blood, she gunned down the tyrant from his throne, leaving the audience stunned. As a new law, Kino declares an optional death match between every first-class citizen to decide the new king, granting the lower hierarchies and slaves protection. Despite being an over-the-top portion in a rather down-to-Earth series, this also illustrates my point clearly. In respect of not drastically altering the tradition within the kingdom, the citizens may continue their senseless killing to satiate their bloodlust without involving the innocent. Whether this quality ethical ambiguity improves or detracts from the show as a whole, the uniqueness of the concept by itself makes Kino’s Journey a notable title among the vast soirée of anime from decades past that have fallen into obscurity.\
        Also mentioned in passing and to reiterate, Kino’s Journey provides influential and powerful social commentary as an element residing within the underlying subtext of the show. The sake of parables presented to the viewer through a series of episodes serves not as mere entertainment value, but the philosophical messages tied to each parable yields a platform for which the viewer is able to ponder and derive their own interpretations regarding existentialism. Simply put, it makes you think. You could think about the flaws regarding human morality, think and suffer from an existential crisis, or think about why things are the way they are. This characteristic built into the core facets of the show was a welcoming surprise after having sifted through copious amounts of mindless anime dedicated solely for entertainment value. To stop beating around the bush and go into specifics, the tidbits of philosophy derived from the show comes with their accompanying “what-if” scenario in the form of a hypothetical, fictional country as discussed previously. The manner in which each country is constructed revolves around a central idea ranging from “a country where no one ever has to work” to “a country that is basically Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451.” (Spoilers Ahead) To illustrate the former example, a country is presented in episode 5 that is completely self-sufficient through technological advancements. Such an idealized, utopian society however contradicts itself and the citizens are forced to work meaningless desk jobs that the robots do much more efficiently. The reason given for this is that humans require stress in their lives to prevent them from becoming lazy and to give their life meaning. In general, fictional nations are given shape and depicted in jarring ways, showing the glaring faults when placed into a realistic situation. Through these methods, the show engages in this sort of “social commentary” that satirizes these hypothetical societies. But that is the end of it. There is no clear-cut solution presented to the audience, but rather a problem left dangling within their minds as a venue to ponder over. The ability for a show to generate discourse for how one would interpret the overall message is what makes it valuable and gives it a much longer lifespan than new, seasonal anime that are forgotten over the course of a few months after their initial release.\
        Personally, Kino’s Journey: The Beautiful World was an enjoyable experience. As a more slow-paced, serene form of media to digest, those seeking thrill and instant stimuli will leave with much left to be desired. It is unlike the extravagance mainstream anime craves in order to attract huge populations of viewers. Some may even say the visuals, animation quality, and entertainment is all that matters.  However, the meaning and fundamental essence of a show is what I consider paramount. As such, the culmination of the meaning I have personally derived from the show is the aforementioned subtitle “The world is not beautiful; and that, in a way, lends it a sort of beauty.”\

Kino's Journey isn't for everyone. It's a thinking mans anime, that isn't for everyone. Kino's Journey isn't for everyone. If your one those people who only care about action and violence this isn't for you. Kino's Journey has no grand story like the end of the world or aliens from outer space. No real supporting characters, the key to this anime is the grand story that is there isn't any story, just Kino and her  talking motorcycle. The story is a wondering Kid who has no destination and only travels with her talking bike. She doesn't stay\
          \
        with more than 7 days in one town so they don't become emotionally involved with the town or city. At some points it becomes a very lonely journey for Kino and sometime she thinks about stopping, but doesn't. They live the life most of us wish we could live. Never answering to anyone and going where we want to go. I know I wish I had done something like that when I was younger. Like I said this anime isn't for everyone. There isn't a lot of action, violence, or sex. So if you are on Prozac and need that to keep your attention this isn't for you, but if you want an anime that will make you think about your life and life in general Kino's Journey is a must. \

    Philosophical ideas, atmosphere, and most importantly, the feels. Usually these elements are what I personally look for in an anime, but I think this is something that everyone should chek owoooouuuut simply because it's one of those shows that demonstrates the amazyn artistic potential of the medium of animu.\
 Kino, the main character of the series is very interesting to watch because of their stoic, confident and almost neutral personality when facing problematic situations. Very similar to Ginko of Mushishi. Anyhoo this is an intelligent and enjoyable anime that must counter that abundant ecchi and shounen shit that dominates the industry. \
Also, this show (along\
          \
        wit any other) is not flawless, but as Kino says \"The world is not beautiful, therefore it is\".\

    First of all, the Anime is not the type to watch for fun out of free time without having to think much, it is more of an educational Anime, where it leads us to think critically about the events taking place in the Anime and to compare those events to what happen in real life, \"thought-provoking\" would be great to describe this Anime as you will need to think carefully about the concepts behind each episode.\
Along with the journey of Kino and her talking bike Hermes, you will come across some events that people tend to normally take for granted or challenge the generalised concepts,\
          \
        which will raise questions in your thought. Some questions were raised in my thought when I watched this Anime, some questions for instance:  \
- \"Does getting to know all of other people's thoughts would necessarily lead the society to a better place to live in?\"\
- \"Will people always return good favour after you have helped them?\" \
- \"Would religion, superstitious belief actually lead society to a better place?\" \
- \"Does culture and tradition really lead people to enjoy life\"? \
- \"Does majority or democracy always lead to the right choices on everything?\"\
There are more questions and lessons that you could actually learn by watching this Anime, the Anime really does an awesome job on provoking people's thoughts. Surely you would wanna watch it yourself if it really is as what I have just said, but to me I really enjoy the concepts behind each episode of this Anime :) \

    Kino's Journey: the Beautiful World, shortened to Kino's Journey, is a Japanese light novel series written by Keiichi Sigsawa, with illustrations by Kouhaku Kuroboshi, which is still being published. A 13-episode anime adaptation was produced by A.C.G.T and Genco aired between April and July 2003. Two manga adaptations were produced, and a new anime series aired 12 episodes between October and December 2017. As of 2017, around 8.2 million copies of the novels have been sold in Japan. Newtype USA (a monthly magazine publication originating from Japan, covering anime and manga) named Kino's Journey the Book of the Month for November 2006 and called it\
          \
        \"inviting and addictive,\" while AnimeOnDVD said it ‘sucks you in,’ and ‘allows you to experience the journey’ together with the main character of the series, Kino. The series has a huge fan base, including the fact that the series is usually mentioned in Takarajimasha's light novel guide book ‘Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi!.’\
Kino’s Journey tells a story of Kino, who is on a never-ending journey. Kino, together with their motorcycle, travel to different places and countries that have their own customs and laws. As a general rule, Kino only stays in each place for 3 days. During these three days, the story will show you the most beautiful places you have ever experienced in your life, or perhaps even the cruelest country. The series will also make you analyze many topics, including: festivals, traditions, different activities, freedom, individuality, war, machines, and even life itself.  There is always a philosophical dilemma that Kino has to solve and these dilemmas sometimes involve some serious decisions that might put Kino’s life on the line. \
It is worth mentioning that the series used to be very popular in 2000; it still has quite a remarkable fan base. Just like me, you might have seen the original in 2003, or even started reading the novel in 2000. In that case, you already know the whole beauty of this series. If not, Kino’s Journey is definitely a huge pearl for those who like slice of life. However, if you believe that this genre is too boring, but still want to watch the series, I would highly recommend you to watch only two episodes a day, otherwise you might find it boring. I also want to concentrate your attention on the fact that Kino’s Journey is not your usual slice of life series; as mentioned before, you will find philosophy, many life dilemmas, some really tragic scenes, and even some action scenes. Granted, if you are patient, this diamond will reward you with its rich story-line. \
Art wise, the character artwork tends to be more simplistic, but this simplicity helps sometimes to build a very dark atmosphere, because this anime is dark and depressive. The background is not also exquisitely detailed, but at the same time there are so many small details. That being said, the anime’s art has too many positive aspects that compensate old animation. Sound wise, there are many great soundtracks. Another thing worth mentioning is Japanese voice actors, who did an amazingly good job. What I mean is that Kino dialogues with Hermes are the main focus of this anime; you have two options watching this anime: the first being just enjoying the show and second being analyzing every aspect Kino no Tabi tries to show you. And I must say it really is a great enjoyment to think about a thing, or two listening to Kino’s voice actress.\
As it has already been stated before, there are two protagonists in this series. Kino is the first main protagonist in the series. They travels to different countries with their talking motorcycle Hermes, which is the second main protagonist, discovering different cultures, customs and people. I am sure that it was one hell of a task for the voice actors to voice their characters, but they managed to do it. The best part about this anime, is of course, its characters. The duo is able to keep you interested in what will happen next, providing you with the necessary character development. \
As a side note, as you might know, Kino no Tabi received a remake not long ago. It is always nice to see that such giants of the SoL genre receive attention; however, it is still obvious that the 2003 version of Kino no Tabi is far superior to its remake; it is just was not as dark as the original, but it still is worth watching. \
Overall rating: a very solid 10/10.  Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World (2003) is a show that I would recommend to any person who loves SoL. However, if you are not a fan of the genre, as it has already been mentioned in my review, you should either watch this anime little by little, or you should just avoid it. Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World (2003) is, indeed, a worthy title. I hope that you will enjoy your journey with Kino and Hermes and perhaps continue it with Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World (2017), which is also a good (not the best) remake for this masterpiece.\

    Kino's Journey is fairly reminiscent of Mushshi in that both protagonists travel without resting in one spot for too long. The two main characters in this anime are Kino and Hermes. Kino is your bad ass character with quite an amazing set of skills some what similar to Spike Spiegle from Cowboy Bebop, except the difference here is that she is a young female.. seem kind of strange doesn't it? I had trouble the first 3 episodes wondering whether Kino was actually male of female but episode 4 clears that up. One big gripe I have with this anime is that they never mention much\
          \
        about Kino, how is she so damn skilled with guns and fighting? why does she only stay in a location 3 days at a a time? how is a little girl like her probably just as formidable as Spike Spiegle? As for Hermes, he's just your typical talking motor bike, mainly just a side kick of Kino's and occasionally shares his thoughts on Kino's decisions. There is no actual plot to this anime, with respect of Kino actually being on a journey, but there are many stories that beg to ask big questions within a society such as what would happen if one could read another's mind? or what if a societies technology was so advanced that they didn't need to do any work? It's quite the philosophical thrill ride if that's what you want it to be. Kino stays consistent in that it doesn't bore you with long arcs that try to find an answer to such questions, but rather just one episode to see an example of such societies. As for an ending, there isn't anything special happening there but Kino finishing another journey. It opens the room for a second season but at the same time who knows. Overall score: 8/10. I thought Kino's Journey was quite an enjoyable anime, and only being 13 episodes, I finished it fairly quick. If you liked Mushishi and a bad ass character like Spike then by all means try this anime out and see it for yourself! \

    This is one of the most interesting shows that i've seen. Each episode tells you a  story, each story mimics the world desire for evolution, survival, dreams, love and creativity.\
This is where some people don't get it, Kino no Tabi is not about the main character, or backgrounds, or her actions. It is about the idea behind the episode, what it is trying to tell you.\
And the beauty is, even if you don't have the proper knowledge to understand where the references are coming from, you will still learn a viable lesson in the end.\

        a old show, but i don't mind so much, i'm used to this type of art.\
SOUND\
There is some nice songs here and there, overall FXs are okay.\
CHARACTERS\
Maybe the weaker part of the show? There is nothing special about kino, her actions, or the side kicks, but again the show was not supposed to be about that.\
STORY\
This is where this piece shines, each episode is a lesson about human nature and desire, some episodes are a little dumb, but overall they are great.\

    Kino’s Journey is a 13 episode series about a young girl travelling on foot - or wheel, if you like - with her talking motorcycle end experiencing what life truly has to offer. They visit many different places together and come in contact with a large variety of people and fates during their exploration of the vast world. This is the basic premise of the show, and really all you need to know regarding the plot before watching it. Hence, I won’t focus on plot related details in this review. Instead, I’ll talk a bit about the themes and the general feeling and atmosphere of\
          \
        this extraordinary piece of anime.\
The lasting impression I received from this show is that it is a very gloomy creation. It is also very dark at times. Sometimes it’s absurd in its darkness; it takes human madness to the edge and far beyond, many times in a fashion that closest resembles black, bizarre travesty, clearly demonstrating the insanity and unreasonableness with everything. I would almost like to draw parallels to classic storytelling and fairytales. Sometimes that’s the feeling I get when watching Kino’s Journey; partly because of the slightly tale-like and mysterious atmosphere, but what I’m mostly referring to in this case is the dark humour. Unfortunately, I don’t have any concrete examples, but I have the impression that fairy tales can often be quite phantasmagoric, sometimes in dark, twisted ways (some of the brothers’ Grimm’ stories comes to mind). Characters and occurrences/phenomena in stories can be highly baroque, and the stories themselves sometimes have a dose of satire and/or irony in them, which is something that no one within the realm of the story itself normally seems to find odd or react to in other ways.\
Kino’s Journey feels a bit similar to this, at times. To us outsiders - the viewers - the things that happen on the screen sometimes seem blatantly, utterly absurd, but the characters in the story never cease to take themselves seriously or question what they’re doing. For the viewer, however, there’s some humour to be found in the madness and absurdity. But, this does not make the darkness and the sad aspects of it make less of an impact. It is quite a tragic show. \
There are few cheerful moments during Kino’s travels (at least from what little we see of it). Even when things are at their merriest, the mood is still characterized by a feeling of loneliness and quiet melancholy. I can count the moments I found genuinely warming using only one hand - with a finger to spare, even. With this in mind, the opening sequence might seem wildly misleading - and it did to me, at first - as the tone it sets doesn’t match that of the show at all. It could be that it’s just very ironic, which would go well in line with what I said about the show in the paragraphs above. What I really think though, is that it alludes to the quote we are given in the very first episode, which goes: “The world is not beautiful, therefore it is.” This would be very fitting.\
Kino’s Journey is a very episodic show, without any consistent thread, thematically or story wise - aside from the exploring and discovering in itself - throughout it. It is grey, black, somber, tragic, tragicomic, melancholic, strange, and at times beautiful, in a way. It satires human behavior and phenomena in society in a very exaggerated fashion, while all the same telling gripping tales of sorrow and tragedy. It presents somewhat philosophical questions, although it must be said that the messages of the show, neither the social nor philosophical, are very subtle, nor is the latter especially deep. Even so, it’s done pretty well.\
The show is very atmospheric, with simplistic but nice animation. The music is on occasion somewhat enchanting, and has a mysterious, almost exotic sound to it at times. The directing is overall pretty good; in a few of the episodes quite a number of events take place, and I’m impressed by the fact that the pace never feels rushed, despite this. The director makes three days (which is the amount of time spent on every location) pass rather quickly, without it ever feeling hectic or unrealistic. \
Kino’s Journey is awarded with 8/10. It wasn’t at all what I had expected - I thought it would be a warm, cheerful, charming little story; it was everything but that - but it was good nevertheless. What keeps me from giving it a higher score is the length of it, which prevents further and deeper exploration of the characters and themes, as well as the lack of a sense of an overall direction; I would have liked it better if the show as a whole would have been a bit better constructed.",

    Wow. This anime, in itself, is a classic and is a must see for anyone who watches anime. It doesn't matter if you are into Mechas, Harems, Fighting, or any of the other genres; you will love this anime.\
Story:\
The anime is based off a book series that has made awards. The way it tells its story is like Galaxy Express 999 just its not linear. The events are placed to give you the feeling that you know whats going on. Each episode has a moral that has a real-life uses. Most of the events could happen in real life. You also find yourself relating to\
          \
        the main character Kino as she goes through her travels through the many countries she visits.\
Art:\
The designs of all the characters, main or background, are done in the style of the old classics. It felt like watching an old anime from the 80's just remastered with the new computerized shading. The technology ranges from a Wright brother's-like flying machine to motorcycles that talk to guns and fully plated armored warriors that when compared to Kino would scare a normal person s***less.\
Sound:\
The music scores bring with it the hard fact that this anime could be real. When the atmosphere is depressing the music multiplies its effect on you. But I love how the English voice cast pulled of the character's own personality in their voices. Granted Kino is rarely giving any emotion in her voice, but to have her voice actress be able to keep the emotionless voice going with out it becoming a monotone drone makes it quite the achievement.\
Character:\
There are only two main characters, and no reoccurring characters, in the anime. This is because the anime goes through maybe the first 2 or 3 volumes, so any reoccurring characters would not seem to be reoccurring. But the main characters have very distinct and opposite personalities. Kino is a realist, she sees things for how they are. She makes now real wise cracks. She does interact with the other as friends would, though. Then there is Hermes, her motorrad or talking motorcycle. He makes wise cracks about stuff that she does and seems pessimistic at times. He constantly goes on about how she doesn't take very good care of him. But anyone can see he finds Kino to be his one and only friend.\
Enjoyment:\
Just the fact that this anime will make you stop to think about how our world is and how people in the real world would react to different situations, not giving the \"and they all lived happily ever after\" ending when you think you will see it. It gives you a reality check and makes you realize that Love Hina, or Gurren Lagann are just fantasies that would probably be dreams not realities.\
Overall:\
It's the Brothers Grimm of anime. It is a bunch of situations in anime that instead of going right, they go wrong and show you the consequences. Again i would like to stat that any one reading this review should go see this anime. This is usually my death threat sentence but the realism is if you don't want to watch this anime, don't. The only one your hurting is yourself for not wanting to face reality.\

    This is a quiet thoughtful anime and, mostly, nonjudgmental. Most of the judgments are made by the viewer, not Kino, the observer/traveler. A review I read called it “quietly nihilistic” and it is - and yet hopeful as well. Each story is a short term story - only the 3 days of Kino’s visit - but usually a crucial 3 days. It touches on ideas like one culture’s impact on another, determination, misunderstandings, history, how attempts to avoid or solve one kind of problem result in other problems, revenge, killing and when or whether it is justified, war, humanity’s stubbornness, tunnel vision, and compassion -\
          \
        each dealt with in small vignettes where you see one aspect of the impact on individuals. It is not happy - some of it is downright tragic - but I did not find it depressing. The series does not offer solutions for the problems, but asks you to observe life carefully. I found it similar in feel to Haibane-Renmei. If you are looking for a swashbuckling adventure or a lot of action, this is not for you. In this anime, each action has consequences and is undertaken mindfully.\

    This anime follows in the footsteps of a young traveler, Kino, and her Motorcycle, Hermes.  Each episode tells the story about their journey to a different country.  Through the art of story-telling, we learn about the people, laws, customs, etc. in each country, and what their significance is in the greater scheme of life.

        is ambiguous.  Her defining quality is her wisdom and quickness, which makes her easy to admire.  Hermes only aids in her endearment, always asking questions and challenging Kino's opinions.  Their dialogue is witty and thought-provoking.\
The only complaint that I have is that the pace was rather slow.  The quirky, hyperactive characters that are usually present in anime are few in this one, which I sort of like because it allows me to take the show more seriously.  However, the way it drags on sometimes made me feel bored.  \
Nonetheless, I really enjoy it because it's unique and intelligent, and yet it's not too heavy.  If you're looking to have a zen kind of experience, this is the anime for you :)\

    If I had to say one thing about Kino's Journey, it'd be its overall theme is supposedly a reversed SoL in a form of expressionism and surrealism. Every land, where Kino traveled to, portrayed the humanity and its heart -- an unusual mixtures of madness and love, cruelty and truth, government and policies, and flaws and retribution. Kino herself witnessed everything on her very own eyes from the neutral corner of the spectrum, although she used to have lived on a similar society which changed her life drastically. Most of the episodes left me an awestruck, self-reflecting impression about the twists and turns of the\
          \
        events happened to the actors and actresses -- whether it may be fortunately or unfortunately for them. As establishing an indirect equivalent word for \"land\" or \"country\", there's one thing I wanted to convey from the author, \"Does he or she have a sheer disgust towards the humanity and blame the pre-assembled society before the observer?\" It may seem that he poured his viewpoints of reality into a mere fiction, and succeeded in an artistic, fashionable way of creating a story.\
Given the fact that the LN art is superior to the anime design, and the fact that the overarching plot and development were a tad lacking, it is.. without a doubt, an imperfect but beautiful world.",

    In my opinion, this is a very interesting series and a world one loves to get lost in.\
It is about a girl and a motorbike, traveling a world where travelers seem to be a rare phenomenon. She encounters the strangest people, customs and situations, not to mention the beautiful environments she finds herself in; who wouldn't dream about such a life?\
First of all the main character, Kino. She is a frail little girl but has a great power and stillness over her. She is strong-willed and easily stays calm in any situation. She is in control but not by forcing things, her attitude is more\
          \
        like wait-and-see and go with the flow. Yet, she is very interested and asks lots of questions. She is open to anyone she meets, is kind-hearted and compassionate, but her experience with different kinds of people makes her careful. She's excellent in combat and if the situation asks for it, she doesn't hesitate to use her arms.\
Hermes, her motorbike, speaks and is a great companion for Kino, as Kino is for him. He has a freshness over him and asks all kinds of questions like a curious child. When something is broken, he just tells Kino he needs that part repaired, which is very handy.\
One of the peculiar things about this series is that it is filled with little details which, if you were to start thinking about it, you could not really wrap your mind around. For example the countries Kino and Hermes travel to, usually appear to consist of just one town and a bit of land surrounding it, while the whole feel to it when Kino and Hermes are there, would suggest that it was a vast country. Another example is that one country seems to exist in pre-industrial times, while a few countries further there is a highly advanced civilization. Then of course the speaking motorbike, that goes everywhere with Kino, even up the stairs into the bedroom. \
All of this makes it a surreal world, but not too surreal. It's all just not really possible,  but yet gets easily accepted and appreciated. \
The series also makes the watcher think about the somewhat deeper subjects of life. One reason Kino travels is to gain a deeper understanding of life, people and herself. Human nature and the nature of the construct itself are touched. She meets people who see the world as a stage and the people as merely players and she meets an enlightened wise man, who later denies that he is. \
Alltogether an unmissable gem for people who love an intelligent, cozy story on the many aspects of life!\

    This is the kinda anime that proved me that 'Love at first episode' really exists. The episodes are mostly unconnected (only one story is split in 2 episodes), so they can be viewed in random order. \
The story reminds me of Antoine de Saint Exup&eacute;ry`s 'The Little Prince' . The protagonist travells to random countries and gets acquainted with the  world he`s in. The worlds are quite bizzare , and mostly are build on some utopian answer of specific 'What if..' question. The characters are well developped , each one of them holds different oppinion of the world , and life in general. In\
          \
        the end most all of the episodes pose an interesting question , and inspire thinking.\
From the artistic side, the worlds are very colorful and vary in the enviroment setting. Although most of the action is dialogue and minimal movement , the action segments are well done.\
I recommend it strongly. \

    This was in general a very enjoyable anime. The enticing portion was of course the story itself, featuring Kino and her journey to different countries. Initially, I thought that the stories were not that fantastic afterall. But after completing the series, I must say that the mangaka has a well-focused theme in mind. The idea or moral behind each arc all revolves around extremely warped human behaviour that lets its audiences step back and give some serious thought about it.\

    Kino's Journey is one of the most beautiful animes out in the world. It was able to describe how beautiful the world really is by stating it's imperfection. I thought is was very impressive how imprefection lead up to beauty. Kino's Journey is probably more of an older teen anime because of the blood and violence in some scenes and it requires pretty high level thinking. Overall, there wasn't nessarily a happy ending or sad ending to each episode but a lesson that is taught in the ever end.

    Story – 9\
Kino’s Journey is an episodic drama that chronicles Kino’s visit to each country. Along the way, you discover peoples’ outward appearances clashing with their inner characters. Some will shock you and disturb you, others will leave you in disbelief, but all will touch your heart. Pacing wise, Kino’s Journey is a slow moving anime in a good way.\
Animation – 8\
The animation is rather simple, yet it is not without its charm. With a few faults here or there (minor nitpicking), the character designs and backgrounds are done well enough. Further, Kino’s childlike stature is part of a bigger purpose: to have you guessing\
          \
        about Kino’s gender. \
Characters – 8\
Kino and Hermes: a human and a motorrad; the show revolves around these two characters. The characters neither change nor grow for the better after each struggle, but they are still nonetheless worthwhile characters in the show. Perhaps as you watch each episode, you will begin to understand why Kino’s demeanor never changes.\
Sound – 9\
The OP and ED of this show are great. I would highly recommend watching this one with the Japanese voice actors and English subs; if anything to avoid getting spoilt on Kino’s gender. Kino’s English voice actor gives it away too easily. Anyways, the voice acting is good for both characters.\
Enjoyment – 9\
Overall this show is excellent and I enjoyed it. With just 13 episodes, the show manages to depict a lot of the characteristics in the world (happiness, sadness, pain, violence – including some disturbing things, beauty, wisdom, etc.). If you like or don’t mind the slow moving paced animes, I recommend you watch Kino’s Journey. Like the world that the show is portraying is beautiful, the anime manages to hold itself in a similar regard.\

    I feel I may have dove into this anime with too high of expectations. I won't say this was a particularly bad watch, in fact I found it to be quite enjoyable, but it felt as if it lacked any real emotion.\
The story is about a traveler named Kino, who drives his talking motorrad (motorcycle) to country to country, all of which vary in many different ways. Each country holds some sort of lesson to be learned, and the viewers job is to dig out those lessons from each journey. Kino's Journey actually doesn't follow any real sequence aside from episode 6 and 7, you\
          \
        could pretty much start anywhere and  still receive the full experience of the series. \
Throughout watching the series, I've come to recognize Kino to be like the viewer, she observes her surroundings and takes in the situation, but very rarely/never gets involved. Just like the viewer of the series, she can only sit back and watch the events that transpire before her eyes, but never can actually experience it or try to change the outcome. I feel some viewers will have mixed feelings on this. While some may be able to sympathize with Kino, some may just get frustrated at her, angry that she allows such events to happen when she could clearly change them. I was somewhere in the middle with this, because though I could sympathize with Kino, I also felt her lack of emotion to be somewhat displeasing. I felt the series could have used some more inner conflict.\
Despite some of the more disturbing scenes in the show, I felt Kino's Journey was very laid-back and light. Even some of the scenes that I felt should have made me angry or upset gave me hardly any reaction, for the series presents each issue rather indifferently, and as a result, my emotions seemed to follow in the pace of the series rather than allowing myself to actually take in the severity of some of the events. I feel this series is actually quite solid though, everything in it flows together and matches one another. The art, the sound, the events, the feel, everything feels as it should be there. Though in saying this, I wish their could have been more to it. I wanted more conflicts, more drama, it was just way to relaxing, and having the same emotion throughout the whole series though is alright, it can only go so far and be so good in my opinion.\
I feel most people can find some sort of enjoyment in this series, just as long as they don't expect to experience some high-action show that gives them 'the feels'. It's something you have to take for what it is from the very start, for their will be little to no variation from beginning to end. If you like the first episode, you'll like the series, if you didn't really enjoy the first episode, drop it cause your mind will not change later on. \

    “The world is not beautiful: And that, in a way, lends it a sort of beauty”.\
'Kino's Journey' is a 13-episode long TV series based on a series of light novels and directed by Ryutaro Nakamura, who is famous for his work on 'Serial Experiments Lain'. The show is episodic by nature, and it follows Kino and her motorrad, Hermes, as they travel from one country to the next in a fictional world, all the while learning of different countries' cultures and customs. 'Kino's Journey' is generally slower paced and contains lots of philosophical dialogue, so for that reason I recommend watching this alongside another anime\
          \
        with an ongoing storyline. \
Given that 'Kino's Journey' is an episodic TV series, there isn't necessarily a plot or story, per se. Generally, each episode follows Kino as she goes to a different country and stays there for three days. Each country has its own different culture and customs that reflect certain societal traits in the real world. 'Kino's Journey' deals with fairly mature themes and ideas, such as censorship, war, religion and the advancement of technology and its effects. As such, 'Kino's Journey' is a rather pessimistic TV series. These themes and ideas are explored through the exaggeration of certain societies. For example, in one country an emperor had made a rule whereby for someone to become a first class citizen, they must fight other lower class individuals in a coliseum setting, where bloodthirsty first class citizens would watch for their amusement. Otherwise, the lower class would have to live under ground in a sewer setting while the first class citizens could live above ground. To me, this was an exaggeration of the social division and class exploitation that is common in many areas of the world today. Irony is also common throughout 'Kino's Journey', and it is comical in a dark, disturbing sort of way. Heck, the fact that the series is called 'Kino's Journey: The Beautiful World' is ironic in itself.\
In way of characters, the only two recurring characters are Hermes and Kino. Hermes is a talking motorrad that accompanies Kino on her journey, and the reason why or how he is able to talk isn't addressed in the TV series. However, since it is common for inanimate objects and even animals to be able to use the human language in this show, we can assume that it's just a facet of their world. Hermes is definitely the less interesting of the two, and while his interactions with Kino are often thought-provoking and sometimes comical, his character lacks depth. Be that as it may, Hermes' purpose in the series is to aide the viewers in understanding or reflecting on a certain concept, so the lack of character development doesn't really hinder him as a character. On the other hand, Kino is a wonderful character and every second of screen time that she had was a joy to watch. \
One reason that Kino is a great lead is that she remains largely neutral towards certain topics for the majority of the TV series. For example, unlike your typical shounen lead, Kino is reluctant to involve herself in other people's affairs, which enforces her neutrality. As 'Kino's Journey' is a series largely focused on philosophy, her approach is not only appropriate, but favourable. A second reason is because of her inquisitive nature. Kino consistently shows a keen interest in understanding the actions of others. She asks the questions that you as a viewer desire to know, which aides you in formulating an opinion regarding a topic. Lastly, Kino is a very calm and composed character. She is rarely seen as being anything other than reserved, even in dire situations, which makes her a very cool and likable character. The only criticism I have of her character is that she lacks a bit of character development. While she does benefit from a few flashbacks, especially in the prequel 'Life  Goes On', and she becomes increasingly one-sided towards the end of the series, it does leave a lot to be desired.\
I have mixed feelings regarding the art in 'Kino's Journey'. On the one hand, it's dark and makes great use of scanlines as to enhance its already gloomy atmosphere. However, with the exception of Kino, I didn't like how the characters were drawn at all. There was very little attention to detail on the characters' facial features, and many of the characters looked the same as each other. Even the background objects, such as houses or the interior of buildings, had very little attention to detail and were very basic. The animation, with the exception of the action scenes which were fairly well done, was about what you'd expect from a typical anime with its budget at the time. \
In contrast, the sound for 'Kino's Journey' is very impressive. The OP and ED songs suit the overall mood of the anime, and are good tracks in their own right. The background music isn't overused, and is placed appropriately to add mood or tension to a scene. Ambient sounds, such as the sounds of footsteps or cocking a gun are done particularly well. Kino's VA in the original Japanese audio also suits her character well as the tone of her voice largely remains the same throughout the series, which is important for a cool, reserved character like Kino. I suppose my only real gripe is that Hermes' voice in the original Japanese audio is quite high pitched and annoying, and somewhat detracts from the show.\
Overall, 'Kino's Journey' was an interesting and enjoyable watch that I would recommend to anyone that is interested in philosophy or can appreciate slower paced anime. Due to the somewhat pretentious first episode, unsatisfactory amount of character development for Kino and pretty poor art, I think an 8/10 is a fair score. \
All constructive criticism is not only welcome, but appreciated, thank you.\

    Kino's Journey is an episodic story about a traveller and her motorrad (a talking motorcycle). Usually in a series of this nature, the main characters would travel around the world getting involved in each town/city along the way attempting to help the people there. The most obvious example that should come to mind here is Mushishi. Kino's Journey is different though. Kino acknowledges her place in the world. She knows she is not God and that she cannot fix everything in the world and so she is happy to be an observer and to only act when necessary. This makes for some remarkable storytelling.\
The most\
          \
        interesting aspect of Kino's Journey is its settings. In most episodes, Kino will travel to a new country where she will stay there for three days before moving on to a new country. Each country has its own story that would be based on a simple concept or theme, but taken to the extreme, for example; a country where everyone could read each other's minds. Since Kino is mostly passive, it allows the story of the country to be the focus of the episode. Nevertheless, we still see each country affect Kino in certain subtle ways. This slowly connects the episodes together as we learn more about Kino.\
Be warned though, Kino's Journey is not for the faint of heart. Each episode will depict both the best and worst aspects of humanity, and, when the show is focusing on the worst aspects, it is incredibly brutal. By depicting all the characteristics of humanity, this series will leave you feeling that, as the title suggests, the world is beautiful. Kino's Journey portrays the complexity of life and it is set at a pace which allows you to reflect on what is happening. It is thought-provoking and may help you understand real world tragedies such as war, famine or tyranny, or just help you understand how diverse humans are and that some bad things will happen due to that diversity. Nevertheless, Kino's Journey manages to remind its audience that it's important to cherish the good times.\
One thing Kino's Journey lacks is detail in the design of its characters. Most characters, while somewhat unique in appearance, aren't drawn in detail and hence feel a bit plain. The countries have similar designs that have been influenced by old European towns. This choice of art style did give a feel that we were travelling with Kino, but in comparison to other animes made around the same time, they should have put more detail into the characters.\
The soundtrack to Kino's Journey is high quality. While there aren't many different songs, the ones that are used are brilliant. The OP and ED for the show are great, especially the ED since it is sung by the voice actor of Kino. The show also has many moments of complete silence, usually to emphasize the feeling of loneliness.\
Since the characters aren't the focal point of the show, there aren't any recurring characters outside of Kino and Hermes. Both of these characters are very accurately voice acted. Kino is neither feminine nor masculine and she is neither an adult nor a child. This makes her quite a unique character, one that isn't seen in many animes. Hermes, the motorrad, is more naive and child-like, usually asking questions that can sometimes be awkward without realising it. The duo is great to watch as they complement each other well. Over the series Hermes doesn't change much at all, but that's not really expected. Kino, on the other hand, goes through slight changes and reflects on her experiences often, but there isn't a fully fleshed out arc to her story.\
The most prominent flaw to Kino's Journey is that the series doesn't feel complete. There are hints to a story developing around Kino, but the show ends before that can progress further. This makes the ending feel too sudden. The series could also have continued just for the sake of exploring more themes and ideas by traveling to more countries. \
Nevertheless, this series is mostly successful for what it aims to accomplish within the short number of episodes. Watching Kino's Journey is a wonderful experience involving many thought-provoking themes and it will leave you wanting more. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys thematically driven shows, but if you want something more character driven, this probably won't be satisfying.\

    I will try to put as few spoilers in here as possible.\
Story \
This is perhaps the strongest point of Kino's Journey. It does a great job juggling many diverse themes while also substantiating their impact and emotional influence, and it does so using no more than two and usually one episode per country that Kino explores. This is certainly praiseworthy: I have heretofore not encountered an \"epic journey/adventure\" themed anime with a plot that is memorable, but Kino's Journey changed this. I clearly recall the themes of each country that Kino explored and their powerful, universalizable messages. The pace was perhaps perfect, allowing me to\
          \
        contemplate each episode thoroughly and absorb its themes.\
Art \
The art perfectly suits an anime like this: The scenery was fantastic and I still remember the beauty of Kino's world as conveyed by the lush grasses, gorgeous mountains, and vast sky. The buildings were drawn nicely as well and convey different architectural styles with ease. The character art is rather lacking, however, and I will address this more in that section.\
Sound \
The music is calm and soothing, and again, it perfectly suits a peaceful anime like this. \
Character \
This is what I consider to be the weakest point of Kino's Journey. While the themes are memorable, I cannot say the same for Kino herself: I found nothing spectacular about her, and her few emotions are dulled by her usually insufficiently robust features. This is true for the rest of the many characters: I wasn't too enticed by their largely stoic expressions. They all looked seemingly alike to me, clouding a profound story and beautiful scenery with vapidity. This greatly detracted from the rest of the anime, especially the story's power, as, instead of appreciating its power and poignancy, I sat back in my chair, sometimes sleepy, having to push myself a bit to get through the mainly character-driven anime. \
Enjoyment\
As previously mentioned, I didn't enjoy this anime as much as I could have due to the passive characters. While I acknowledge Kino's Journey as a mainly peaceful anime, I shouldn't have been having to push myself to get through it. My satisfaction mainly comes from the vivid art, wonderful music, and influential themes, which were unfortunately downshifted by the lackluster characters.\
Overall\
Kino's Journey is unequivocally a series for contemplation. The themes are indeed potent and the show certainly deserves acclaim for being able to squeeze many of them together in a short series. I wouldn't recommend watching it for enjoyment, as you will be disappointed over its emphasizing of themes over action. While it does make a legitimate attempt to keep the viewer interested, it wasn't enough for me. Had there been more upheavals and more malleable characters to account for them, I would surely call this a masterpiece and add it to my favorites. But, I unfortunately cannot, as the presentation was simply too lacking.\

    Deciding to watch Kino no Tabi was a great thing. This, for me, is one of the animes that I can talk about with others, despite the fact that they have or have not seen it. It's an anime that you can tell anyone as a story, because it's beauty lies within the story and how it's handled. That's the reason I decided to write this short review and share my experiences with you.\
When I first started watching this amazing show, I didn't have much expectations. Like usual, I finished the series and felt satisfied, that once more I had watched a great series, full\
          \
        of new experiences and brand new feelings. But unexpectedly, it started popping up in my mind again and again as a nice and refreshing memory that I could think about before I went to sleep or after I encountered something inspiring. This is because the show itself involves much more fields of experiences than meets the eye. Many situations can be connected to various episodes, although these connections often don't seem to be easy to detect. \
I also want to talk a little about the main character, Kino. Kino, for me, didn't appear to be a character you could grow close to or get attached to in some special way. She is the type of character you will be very glad to encounter, but won't have any hard feelings of letting go and that's her beauty. Talking machine, Hermes, is also important to me as something very special to Kino and it also made me remember my childhood, time of couple of imaginary friends. \
I want to end my short review (if you can call it that) with me recommending it to everybody. For me, it wasn't the series that would hook you up with your computer but rather a set of very interesting lessons and surprising characters. You might not be able to remember everyone's names, but story behind each and every character will stay with you for a very long time. \

    What an awesome anime! This anime is very different from others because after every episode, Kino tells us what she thinks and then they let us think and decide about people, like: \"Are they doing the right thing or the wrong thing? Do they have any other choice? And why are they doing this?\" And also, \"Is the world as beautiful as we think?\" (We have to accept the people of the world no matter what, then the world is more beautiful.) But in reality or in fantasy, we can't do anything about it or majorly change the world (or some people can change it\
          \
        just a little by helping anyone who needs our help and doing good things to protect nature) because some won't listen to reason and we are just travellers who pass through who can't stay forever. I think this anime takes us on a journey through our own morals. Everything is brilliantly executed in this anime. All I can say is that this is a must-watch masterpiece.\

    Kino no Tabi is an absolutely incredible show, and definitely one of the best I've ever seen. I wasn't sure what to expect going into it, but I really loved it. The overall tone of the series was fairly dark, which goes well with the theme \"The world is not beautiful; therefore it is\". \
That said, there were a few moments of brilliant achievement, and for all of the darkness they seemed that much better. Although the series ends on a note that could be called bittersweet at best, it was consistently thoughtful and imaginative, and every episode had an underlying philosophy that provoked a\
          \
        truly difficult question; I felt this to be especially true for the finale. \
Looking back, I can't remember a single thing about this show that I would change; even the discovery that Kino was actually a girl (which I didn't find out until halfway through) was a kind of neat surprise. This is probably my second favorite anime, after Eve no Jikan (Time of Eve).\
10/10 all around.\
(To be honest, the art probably doesn't deserve a 10 - I'd probably but it around a 7 - but the rest of the show is so good that it doesn't matter in the slightest). ;)\

    Kino no Tabi or Kino's Journey in English is not one of those slice of life shows that travels around the world shooting bad guys and whatnot. It's an episodic series about Kino and here companion Hermes (a talking motorcycle) that travels throughout their world/universe for an unknown cause.  Let me first start of with the story progression it's not one of those standard adventure series with action and pretty people and whatnot it's about the progression of Kino's Journey/travels and the people and customs they come across with. That is where the proper use of rising climax and conflict resolve comes into play\
          \
        when they come across a new country there is a custom (like countries in real life) and some of these customs they come across are pretty bizarre like travelers fighting in a Colosseum for fame and a spot at the upper class and if you lose or refuse you will die. At the end of the day your fight for your life is just to please some mentally sick king. For an example also at the end of each episode or arc there is a moral/message at the end. The artwork is pretty good by noir standards (really is this the same character designer for the anime series noir) but didn't aged well by modern standards but if you like early 2000's anime or gotten the blue ray your in for a treat. The Characters are amazing in their roles like Kino for instance the anime portrays her as some emotionless girl due to all of the horrid stuff happening in the world of Kino no Tabi. At the same time she can be very easy going/friendly if she doesn't feel threatened. And there's Hermes her sarcastic talking motorcycle that does most of the talking for Kino and keeps the show interesting for the audience. The other characters even the ones that only appear once do there jobs pretty well. The reason why I gave the characters a nine is due to not being any returning characters. The Soundtrack is pretty forgettable and one of the weakest elements in the series. Enjoyment factor is a perfect ten because like me and other people hear who love world building or series that have detailed worlds. My final verdict I have to give is a nine out of ten or other words WATCH IT! If you love stories with world building/details,great main leads,and a great story in your anime.\

    Kino no Tabi is a series that caught my attention through it's comparisons to Mushishi (One of my all time favorites). It follows the journey of Kino and her talking motorcycle as she navigates a number of different countries, it's essentially a study of human nature wrapped in a unique little package of 13 episodes.\
Being episodic in nature, each story is self-contained in just over 20 minutes. (with the exception of one two-part arc). The stories mostly revolve around Kino and her motorcycle entering a country and interacting with it's inhabitants, the particular theme for the story may not be apparent at first and is\
          \
        usually covered in a little mystery, but at the end of the mere 20 minutes it somehow manages to convey a sense of insight into the most deepest of topics, often leaving an emotional resonance as most stories are tragic in nature. The themes of the episode range from relationships, culture, war, religion to many more. \
The main character is Kino, she is a small and almost genderless in appearance but has a very deep, thoughtful side to her. Her interactions with the countries and it's people are what makes this anime so absorbing, she approaches each situation with an almost enlightened indifference, allowing the characters to express their motives and situations without any restraint. In contrast to her unassuming nature she has a deadly side to her as well, her backstory isn't full explored but at some point she trained to become an excellent marksmen and fighter which adds an extra dynamic to her travels since they aren't always peaceful. The motorcycle Hermes isn't anything special in my opinion and doesn't add to the insight, but he provides Kino with an outlet for thoughtful reflection on her encounters.\
The art and sound in Kino didn't jump out at me in any specific way, but it serves it's purpose fine. Kino no Tabi is gentle and meditative in nature, and the art designs and sound fit that. There's no overly elaborate characters, and the music itself is subtle and rarely used. Most of the time I barely noticed the sound apart from some gentle background tracks. The uplifting opening  and end themes are the only ones that stick in my mind, and both are great choices.\
To summarize Kino no Tabi is a thoughtful series, it may be small in it's number of episodes, but it's huge in it's ambition and insight into various topics. I'd recommend it be viewed slowly, an episode once every night or two and give it your full and undivided attention to get the most out of a truly beautiful series.\

    This is a show that is hard to give justice to in just a paragraph or two. It is a unique show that makes a few choices that on the surface seem like it wouldn't work. However it is these same choices that make the show stand out the way it does.  \
One of the most important parts of the show are the two main characters, because these are the only things that you are going to see repeatedly from beginning to end. Every other person or place you will see for only one episode and then its gone. We have Kino and Hermes.\
          \
        Kino is a traveler and Hermes is the talking motorcycle that Kino drives. Kino is a little bit of an odd one in that nothing gets her excited. Even when her life is on the line she never seems overly troubled by the whole thing, and when it comes to morality issue she seems somewhat indifferent. This may sound like I am being very negative toward Kino, but that is just not true. Although she may not go down as one of the most emotional or vibrant characters in anime, the character's personality play a significant role in the show. One of the main things that mades this show so good is how it deals with the issue of morality and philosophy. Many shows run into the problem of having an idea shoved down the viewer's throat. With Kino as the lead it is very easy for the show to side step this pitfall. The show presents the idea and it is what it is. It is just there for the viewer to think about without one side or the other being pushed on the audience. Who ever thought up Hermes was a genius. Hermes is a motorcycle and he can't help anyone or ever move unless someone drives him. The only thing he can do by himself is talk. The show uses this to have Kino and Hermes talk through the various ideas of the show. This really helps the ideas move along without taking a side. If one of the characters favors one side a little more than the other, the other will always play devil's advocate. Hermes help keeps Kino in the spotlight sense Hermes can't really interact with anyone. The people Hermes and Kino meat along the way are short live but some of them still manage to stick out and be memorable.\
So we have Kino and Hermes and they travel from one “country” to another. “Countries” in this show are not much more than a city/town with a wall around it. Each country has some gimmick. Some are technologicaly advanced, some have deep religious believes, etc. Kino visits one of these countries ever episode(sometime more then one) and the viewer is exposed to some new idea. There is also usually some problem to the country as well. The thing is Kino isn't going to fix all these problems, and even the time she does get involved nothing is ever completely fixed. The countries are creative and the ideas are interesting. The problem with this journey is that it has no point. The show points out that there is no point to the journey more than once. Kino is not trying to get some place, find something, or learn anything. There is a reason for her starting this journey but the show does not tell you until you get several episodes into the show, so I am not going to give it away. Because of this, although the show does a good job of presenting the ideas and stories in an individual episode, there is a lack of focus to the over all show and there is not a solid conclusion at the end.\
I also want to point out the action. Action isn't a focus of the show, and really there is only around 2 parts of the show that have action. However the few time it does deal with action I found myself extremely impressed with it. The show deals with action so little that I wouldn't suggest it to action fans, but it is a nice bonus to have such well done action sequences in a non-action focused show. \
I have heard people give high prays to the art style of the show, I don't see it. I don't have a problem with the character animations, they look OK. It is the environments. Even if I take into account that it is a stylized look stuff like trees and bushes don't look much better then green blobs. Maybe I just can't appreciate it, maybe I am missing something, but I don't think the animation is that good.\
I know there are a lot of things wrong with Kino's Journey. The story wanders and has no goal, the animation isn't wonderful, and the main character has a very small emotional range. However at the end of the day I didn't care, I love this show. The countries Kino visits are interesting, the 2 main characters play to the shows strengths, and the philosophical element doesn't feel forced. For anyone who likes shows with heavy emphases on ideas of morality, this is a need to watch.\

    They say the world is beautiful.  The world of Kino no Tabi (AKA Kino's Journey) is a strange one, with many different places, some with outstanding, advanced technology, others with simple, middle age advancements.  Just a story about this is interesting enough to keep my attention, but for this anime to be on my all time favorites list, it has to be more.\
There really is no over arcing story for the anime, it is simply a woman named Kino traveling around on her talking motorcycle, staying in each country and taking in the surroundings for only three days.  There is no big\
          \
        mystery, or anything of the kind, but this isn't a bad thing, it is in fact a nice change of pace from serious anime or dumb comedy's, which are both fine in their own respect.  However the simple nature of Kino's Journey is the fact that we are simply like our main character, observing the society without interfering unless her life depends on it.  We are not talked down to, not at all, we are left to decide how to feel on each and every situation we encounter along with Kino, and the strange customs of each country. \
The art style in the show is nothing great, most people at a first glance would think the animation is cheap, with sharp lines and ghoulish figures.  However when you watch the show, you realize that it was intentional.  These drawings are able to get the simple message across without being in your face about it.  That being said, the animation is still rather dull and lifeless at times, never really excelling or being below average, always staying the same.  Overall I'd have to give it a six.\
Now for the sound.  Kino's journey is hard to talk about because I can't remember many songs aside from the opening, ending, and Kino's own song.  The show itself lets silence take over, with only the sound of the world and everything going on taking over.  This isn't a bad thing, for it gives the show its own distinct feel.  The music comes in when it has to, and nothing more.\
Now for Character... Kino is my favorite female character of all time.  That being said, she is also sadly under developed.  We usually spend each episode with the characters inside of it, only giving Kino one or two episodes to herself and her own backstory.  We know about her \"Master\" and how she became a traveler in the first place, but we really don't know much about her until the final episode, when we learn why she has her three day rule and we all go \"Oh, that's why.\"  So why is she so interesting to me?  Well for starters, she isn't feminine, in fact we don't even know she is a women until episode four when we look into her past.  That being said she isn't masculine either, she is just \"Kino\".  She doesn't want to express masculinity, in fact she is quite happy being a female.  She knows that she shouldn't meddle in other peoples affairs, which shows just how wise she is while in some episodes she only gets a handful of lines.  We are meant to determine most of her character for ourselves, which is quite fun and irritating at the same time because we want to know more about her.\
Kino's Journey is not for everyone.  It can be slow and sleep-worthy to some, while exciting and enthralling for others.  I'll let you decide on why to check it out, give it a few episodes before deciding.\

    *Minor spoilers. Proceed at your own risk!*\
An oddly structured and paced anime series that hides unexpected violence and emotional and philosophical depths behind its cute, simplistic art style. The story concerns itself with Kino, a young traveler in a strange world where every town is its own country, with its own unique people and customs and eccentric technology. Kino has sworn an oath to never stay more than three days and two nights in each town--just long enough to recover from her arduous travelling and to learn of the history of each town she stays in. Oftentimes she runs into conflict, and her passivity offers\
          \
        piercing insights into the nature of each town (and, of course, human nature), while frequently resulting in painful situations, both for herself and for others. Which of course makes the moments of lightness where everything goes right all the more affecting.\
There really is no overarching story to speak of--there is no end-goal for Kino, and because she never stays for long in any town (sometimes mowing through multiple towns per episode), there are no recurring characters, other than her and her talkative motorcycle, Hermes. Still, the team behind this series manage to get some surprising mileage out of this purposely restrictive structure--two episode-long flashback sequences detailing Kino's past give the series a hefty emotional anchor, and there are a few moments that will leave those with the attention span for this sort of thing misty-eyed. \
Ultimately it's a bit hard to really recommend--there's a limited audience for something like this, even (perhaps especially) among anime fans. It's also considerably darker then its outward appearances would suggest, in some ways surpassing even the cynicism of a series like Neon Genesis Evangelion. Still, those looking for a mentally stimulating experience would do well to seek it out.\

    Ever thought about going on you're own journey? Escape from reality and jump into the The Beautiful World of Kino's Journey. \
This is a 13 episodic anime that tells about a girl named Kino and her talking motorcycle Hermes. Each episode is something different that envolves Kino and Hermes visting different towns with different rules, but only staying for a day. Kino incounters a lot of strange things on her journey from everything to salvery, to canablisiam. \
Kino's Journey goes through all different kinds of sessons and years. But I felt as I got more into it, it became a little less interesting. The first\
          \
        eight episodes are fantastic, they dive into the literature and folklore of Japan. But after that, the storytellers seemed to not really care any more about the show, with less-then interesting plots. I think it needed more episodes, I wanted more out of the back story of Kino. \
Kino's Journey is still a good anime, that needed more time to fully develope, then it would of been something great. But the first eight or so episodes are worth it. \

    Kino's Journey is a series that I think will stick with you for a long time after you watch the final episode. Kino's Journey has almost no over arching plot, but it still managed to be one of the most thoughtful and contemplative shows  I have seen in a long time. The show is extremely episodic and is basically a collection of stories that the main characters listen hear while traveling. The stories, and the episodes of the show, are be twisted, dark, sad and depressing, philosophical, and thought provoking all at once. The writing is probably the show's greatest strength. If you are\
          \
        familiar with the show Over the Garden Wall, Kino's Journey is basically a more mature version of that.\
Another of highlight of Kino's Journey is its sense of atmosphere. I watched the show almost entirely in one sitting because this show practically had me in a trance. It could be both calming and unnerving at the same time. If you are looking for a show that is philosophical, thought provoking, dark, and just plain interesting than you cannot get much better than Kino's Journey.\

    Kino’s journey is an anime about things just happening throughout the world as kino travels from country to country, and only stays in one place or country for three days max. This leads to the anime being mostly episodic with each story being self contained within one or two episodes with no real effect to the other episodes. The show presents many ideas and questions throughout the show such as ethics, religion, culture, technology,life’s purpose, and so on. However since the series is episodic in nature; the anime only has time to explore within one episode before moving on to the next one. The world\
          \
        of the anime is never properly explored or explained as the technology and life styles of one country differ greatly from another such as one country only learning how to use flight while another country already having self serving machines. While the world as a whole is never properly explored each country is, at least as much as it can for the duration of the episode, while not the grandest of world building it still fulfills its task. The world of kino’s is also not a kind one as bad things always happens in places she goes to, but because of how bad the world is can it now show how beautiful it is. When it comes for the episodes themselves, about three fourths of the episodes are actually good while the rest are mediocre but there not bad. Each episodes has proper pacing and has a easy flow to it, the way the episodes play out are intriguing, and the anime mostly comes full circle each episode and once in another episode. \
The main characters in the anime are kino and Hermes. Kino is a traveler going from country to country, and just traveling across the world in order to see what interesting things it has in store for her. She mostly has a stoic attitude about herself, but more is shown about her as each episode goes along by her actions and interactions with other people, as well as her backstory of how she became who she is now. Nonetheless she isn’t much of a character serving more as an analog for the viewers due to being more of an observer rather than a doer to the events around her. She plays more of the role of the ask man since she know little about the countries that she is going to which is the mode in which ideas are explored.  She does have the ability to stop things from occurring, but doesn’t do so since it would cause troubles for her and any other traveler in the long run. However despite doing little her mere presence is like a small cog in  the machine that is essential to start the events, Hermes is her companion who is a talking motorrad  and kinos means of travel throughout the story. Despite being a motorbike he is very reluctant of people and places and is more comfortable not going to many places as kino wants to. The rest of the characters in the story vary in terms of character, but all them mostly play a role as a mouthpiece to the ideas that each country represents to the people both the good and the bad, but never placed in the gray area.\
The production value for the show is decent to say the least. All the characters in the anime have an interesting design to them, most countries are always given a different look to one another. The coloring and lighting of the show gives it a rather calm and dry feeling to it, but other times it has a fantasy feeling. The animation for the show is also ok since the pacing of the show is rather slow there is never much in terms of action or movement, but when it happens the show does a good job most of the time. There’s not much in terms of music when it comes to the show as it uses silence more, but the music it does have is good. \
Overall the show is an OK watch if you're looking for a show that has a nice flow that takes its time as well as being a bit thought provoking. there's also a side story and two movies, but due to their length they're more or less just extra episodes and are a decent watch as well\

    Structure\
The structure of kino no tabi is quite similar to mushishi, that being that most of its episode are independent of one another, but there are instances in kino no tabi where episodes comprise of multiple stories which are independent of one another. Each episode is quite is quite similar in the sense that in each kino ventures to a new and interesting setting. These settings often times hold philosophical significance. There are many instances in which the anime reiterates phrases to pull significance to them and you should pay attention to these instances in which it does and discern their meaning.\
Story\
It is often the\
          \
        case that for works of art we are left to our own devices to discern the implicit meaning which the artist is attempting to show. This is quite evident in kino no tabi as much of the significant meanings are often times not given to us directly but shown by the choices the protagonist makes and the interactions she has with the setting around her. Most of the time these meanings are easily discernible whilst in other instances I find myself quite dumbfounded. Perhaps it may be at the fault of the director for not providing sufficient information or perhaps I am simply too myopic to discern them.\
Characters\
Most of the time characters are sufficiently developed and these characterizations help in discerning the implicit meaning within the story. \
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
It is quite difficult to really hard to describe the beauty of kino no tabi without going to explicit detail. So in this area I will discuss kino no tabi with spoilers. Read at your own risk.\
The most significant episode and perhaps the one that latched me onto kino no tabi was episode 2. This episode delves in morality and shed some light on kino's character. In this episode kino aids 3 stranded travelers from starving to death. The most significant aspect of this episode is the reason she provides. Her motorad questions whether she did it for the sake of the moral that humans should aid one another. She respond by stating because they were both humans does not give reason for her to aid them and that the reason she she helped them was because she would like to believe others will do the same for her if she was put in such a position of precarity. It shows that she is not bind by the moral belief that humans should aid each other, but that she is acting upon self interest. This is emphasized by the quote in which she states \"Charity is not for the sake of others\". This led me to question those that argue on the basis of moral beliefs or of any other basis which seems irrational. Perhaps these individual act not for the sake of the reason which they provide, but for the sake of which it in turn benefits them and that the reasoning is simply a facade to appeal to others. Other episodes I was quite fond of are 9 and 11, but I will not go into explicit detail about it.\
The episode which I was most confused about was 7. I wonder what was the significance of the woman's smile and the beauty of the country which she saw. I was also confused about kino's choice to implement a rule in which all first class citizens fought each other till there exist only one. The only tangible reason I could guess was that she did it to return the country to its former dictatorship, but if that is the case then why? Did she not wish for the country to transition into anarachy in fear of that it would result in the same outcome of the country she encounter early which had collapsed under anarchical rule. \
There instances where I find the director's perception to be quite myopic, but I don't see that as a valid criticism. After all, the manner in which I perceive the world is tangible to me just as equally as theist's belief in god is tangible to them. To each of their own, I guess. I am quite fond on the manner in which the director displayed his ideas within the anime though.\
Also, I was really not fond of episode 13. I found that it has no philosophical significance and that it merely catered to the simplistic of desires.\

    i have read other reviews on this anime and wondered why it received such high ratings. Originally I was going to judge the book by the cover (in this case the art) but I was really surprised how much I fell in love with the story. The story line is episodic with different stories to each countries they travel, bringing different emotional feelings inside of you. I'm not too great at expressing myself -- sorry. Another thing I want to get into is the character, Kino. Her calmness and curiosity really makes you sympathize with wanting to know more behind the country's history as well\

    Alright... heres the short review: \
This anime can be dark one second, then light and happy the next. It deals with deep issues of the human race and asks questions of: what society would be like if.... as well as: if this belief of **** was taken to the extreme,  life would be like.... (and other things silmular to these questions) The art is not great by any means but it really doesnt need to be, actually if it was too great it would take away from some of the deep topics the story goes into. So, in short, this anime is a good\
          \
        anime for a mature audience that can make one ponder about life and how mankind could be in multiple situations.\
And Heres the Long Reviiew: \
Story:\
The story revolves around a girl named Kino and her motor bike named Hermes traveling from 'country' to 'country' meeting new societies and peoples. The 'countries' in this world are large cities that are surrounded by large walls. Each country she visits she only stays for 3 days and then moves on, no matter how great or horrible the country is. The story also goes into people she meets on the road, either fellow travelers, hermits, or others that she runs into. So, if you do not like random stories that only slightly relate to each other, this anime may not be for you. Also, some questions about Kino's past are not fully answered, but this is not fully a bad thing. For this allows her to still be a sort of stranger to the audience, like she is to the people she meets. Also, the ending is not really conclusive, but again this isn't really a negative, for I personally liked feeling that we only got to see a small section of kino's travels. This made me want more, but did not cause me too much anger from not getting any more.\
Art:\
The art is overall not very good. Nothing to horrible, but it is definately simple drawings. Hermes is done pretty well though, which is nice that the artists did not make the motor bike look cheap, but again, the art was nothing to be proud of. \
Sound:\
Nothing greatly stood out to me, however thhe opening song was pretty nice in my opinion. and the little bit of the ending song that I heard everytime before i quickly changed to the next episode appeared to match the show quite well. (not being able to wait for the ending song to finish because i wished to see the next episode soo badly is a pretty good sign that this show is good)\
Character:\
There are really only two main characters in each episode: Kino and Hermes. My only true issues were that Hermes... a bike....talked... This may sound strange and it took some getting used to (at least for me) But soon I was able to adjust and the show definately wouldn't have been  as good without Hermes being able to talk. Also, Kino's entire story was not shared with us, neither all of her past (only a part of it) or her future plans... but as I said before this wasn't all bad... It was sort of like she traveled into our lives for a bit and then left without us fully understanding everything about her, just like she visited our country and left... this fits the story very well and was fitting to her character (so I thought). The numerous side characters are very good and can be as dark as cannabalistic slave traders to as pure as passifists and little children. all done very well and almost every character poses yet more deep and meaningful insights into the human race and the 'what ifs' of society.\
Enjoyment:\
Overall, very high... Only negative for me... the way they portrayed religion 9/10 was very negative... being a christian myself I thought they could have at least have tried to show a positive outlook to it. Don't get me wrong, I liked how they showed how some religions are made and taken advatage of by selfish and power hungry people, but with every negative there are also positives... I sorta wished that would have been stressed more in some of the stories which only appeared to show the negative extremes in each situation...\
Overall:\
Very good, but I suggest mature audience, and I believe most people would enjoy this... some dark themes are addressed. But if one can accept that, I think they can last the 13 episodes of this anime without too much trouble... You probably will even want to watch it again.. :)\

      description = "Hermes is a Brough Superior motorrad (a two-wheeled vehicle that cannot fly but moves in the direction it's pointed&mdash;in other words, a motorcycle) who travels around with Kino. Hermes provides the speed that allows them to go anywhere they wish. Aside from his speed and capacity for toting about large amounts of luggage (Kino never seems to travel light), Hermes doesn't really have many other qualities except for constantly mixing up quotes and complaining. He is also rather gullible, trusting Kino absolutely even when Kino is teasing him, which leads him to grumble and complain some more. Perhaps his most famous line is \"I'm bored.\" The motorrad is in many ways naive and innocent, and acts very child-like, which tends to be a sharp contrast to Kino's more mature and worldly bearing. Still, Hermes is quite reliable and makes a good companion for long trips. \
 In the Gakuen Kino off-shot series, he takes the form of a cell phone strap instead.\

 In the novels, multiple stories are devoted to her travels alongside a man referred to as her \"student,\" when she was in her late twenties. She and her student are shown as being incredibly greedy, even to the point of being cruel. They travel in a battered yellow car.\

  synopsis = "Based on a hit light novel series by Keiichi Sigsawa, the philosophical Kino's Journey employs the time-honored motif of the road trip as a vehicle for self-discovery and universal truth. Deeply meditative and cooler than zero, the series follows the existential adventures of the apt markswoman Kino along with talking motorcycle Hermes as they travel the world and learn much about themselves in the process. Imaginative, thought-provoking, and sometimes disturbing, Kino's journey is documented in an episodic style with an emphasis on atmosphere rather than action or plot, though still prevalent. ",
