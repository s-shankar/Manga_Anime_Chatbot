    Saint Seiya was one of the very first anime series I watched as a young kid.  Being that I might've had a bias towards this anime, I decided to watch it again not very long ago.  While I admit this series is not as good as I remembered it, I belive it is still worth watching.\
Saint Seiya had a brief run on Cartoon Network, but due to its violent content, it was moved to a very poor time and gradually lost any attention it received.  If you followed it while they aired it or if you are just curious, I encourage you\
          \
        to give it a try.\
The story follows the following paradigm: Athena, with the help of the zodiac saints, protects the Earth from the other gods whose wishes are only to do away with humanity.  The use of Greek mythology is vastly employed throughout the story as other gods such as Poseidon and characters such as Medusa make appearances.   \
 While that may sound quite simple (and it is very much straight forward), the characters undergo a thorough process of development.  With each fight they seem to acquire more knowledge and powers that help them mature from teenagers to men.  The themes of friendship, loyalty and endurance are some of the most explored throughout this anime.  The bond that ties the saints with Athena is mere responsibility at first, but extends itself to friendship and love.\
Regarding action, there is plenty of fighting from beginning to end.  At first the matches are part of a game, but later on they develop into life and death situations.  As the series progresses, the saints also acquire more power, which makes the fights all the more interesting.  I do have to warn you, though, since there is quite an amount of death and blood throughout these fights.\
When it comes to animation, it shows that the the series was made in the 1980's.  For its time, and even compared to some more recent anime, the animation is quite decent.  I have no complaints about it.\
The OST fits the series very well.  Most of the tracks help convey the series' feeling of the larger-than-life plot and battles in the entire story.  I believe they did a phenomenal job here.\
---\
 One last comment I'd like to make:  This is not another dragon ball z.  While there are some similarities, there is more involvment of more characters than in dbz (it doesn't always come down to helping the main character do everything).  \

    Story\
Saint Seiya is a shounen  that features several elements of mythology (mostly Greek mythology) and astronomy (constellations). The main characters, the Bronze Saints (knights), are responsible to protect goddess Athena and the humanity against the evil gods. \
The fights are generally interesting, specially because the majority of the characters have a badass aura around them. On the other hand, they are more static than in other anime of the same genre, mainly because of the few techniques used by the Saints/knights.\
The story is quite simple for the most part, and goes in a very monodimensional way, but it is solid.\
Although the main focus of\
          \
        the plot is the war between Gods, the plot of the first arc revolves around the consequences of the Pope’s betrayal in Athena’s Sanctuary.\
The first episodes feature the Bronze Saints fighting each other in the highly used but never old “tournament system”, competing for a very desired prize: Sagittarius Gold Cloth. \
After the introduction of the main characters, Sanctuary arc really starts. We are introduced to a corrupted Pope, a man who should profess Athena's wishes, but uses Athena's soldiers to his evil intentions.\
The Pope sends the Silver Saints to kill the Bronze Saints with the excuse that they deviated from their path. Some of the Sanctuary Saints know about the Pope’s evil intentions, others not. \
It’s valid to say that it takes some episodes to reveal Athena's true identity. The same thing for the Pope.\
It also takes some episodes for the Gold Saints appear. They are the strongest Athena's soldiers.\
After this small summary, I tell you that Saint Seiya is a very entertaining anime, but it may have not aged well for the newer audience. I really don't now if it will please people that are only into modern days shounen.\
Also, as I said, there are a lot of faults in the anime story when you compare it with its manga. So I wil tell some of them in the next lines. \
Differences between anime and manga\
The anime has some features that are superior than the manga, like the art in general, especially Character Design and Clothes (armors). \
But the studio also created a lot of filler characters: some of them has not even a category (Bronze, Silver or Gold) or a constellation well defined.\
There are also the total unnecessary Steel Saints, that have good-looking armors, but fight just using mechanical weapons, without cosmo (chi). They appear in some episodes at the beggining, but then they vanish without any explanation.\
Other big difference is that Hyoga is disciple of Camus in the manga. In the anime, Hyoga is disciple of Crystal Saint. And Crystal Saint is disciple of Camus. This will have a significant implication in the future arcs (reveal more than this would be a spoiler).\
The 12 Zodiac Temples Arc starts well, following the manga as much as possible, but the final fight is very different.\
After this part, there is a whole filler arc, the Asgard arc. It features new enemies: the God Warriors. The armors and personalities of the enemies are very well made and solid for a filler. But fillers always have some fault: the God Warriors were made so strong, that they somehow overshadow the power of Marinas (from the following saga, cannon material).\
This anime ends in the Poseidon arc, and has its sequel in Hades Chapter OVAs.\
Animation and sound\
Saint Seiya's songs are very, very good. The quality of the animation decreases in some episodes but it can be considered generally satisfactory if you take into account the time it was made. The character design, as I said, is way better than in the manga, especially the Clothes (armors).\
Characters\
Though some people may criticize their lack of free will in following Athena, I think the main characters of Saint Seiya are very catch. Each one of them helped to create the stereotypes of shounen characters (even influencing the conception of Gundam Wing's main cast):\
Pegasus Seiya (impulsive and obstinate); Shiryu (calm and rational); Hyoga (sometimes hesitant, but rational when fighting seriously); Shun (kind-hearted, peaceful and emotive); Ikki (antihero, independent and secure).\
All this characters are orphans who grew up together. But the singular relation between them is better justified in the manga, where they are all brothers.\
Other saints I must highlight are the Gold Saints. Each Gold Saint represents one of the signs of the zodiac, sometimes even in powers and personalities, though some of them must be a little stereotyped.\
Most of the enemies in the series are fairly developed for an 80's anime, as they usually have a background story and a meaning to fight that takes the story beyond the good x evil plot. \
I am suspicious in praising Saint Seiya, since it was my first anime, so it was very important to my childhood. But I can recommend it to those who like old-school anime, since it may be dated to younger viewers. I also recommend to read the manga, if you have time and want to better understand the story. The art is worse, but the plot works better. \

    Let me start by saying that this was the very first anime I watched complete. Truth is I was really young when I watched it the first time, but just recently when new OVAs came out I watch it once again. \
Basically the story follows a group of 5 \"Zodiac warriors\" of Athena in their mission to save the world from the \"evil\" gods who want to destroy it. The anime heavily relies on Greek mythology, so the story follows a path trough Olympian’s gods. \
The story is really absorbing and exciting, the fact that the 12 zodiac signs appears as a main part of\
          \
        the story sets the mood for a more personal and deeper involvement in the story (who doesn't want to watch he's own Zodiac sign win??). Whilst the animation is not up to what we are used nowadays, it’s quite decent for its time. The sound is decent but just that. And the characters are well built. \
But what makes Saint Seiya stand alone, is, its art. Every warrior is based upon a constellation, and every warrior has his unique armor. Somewhat around 100 armors are displayed trough the anime.\
So I really recommend this anime if you are interested in watching a cult anime, with really cool art, average animation, and a no so deep story arc.\

    This series is a hard one for me to rate at all. It is one of my all-time favourites, has amazing nostalgic values + I like to think of it as the father of all Shounen Fighting Anime. This is because it started a lot of storylines that have now become cliches Naruto, Bleach and many more use quite often. These include giving the opponent a backbone by giving him a backstory. Tournament arcs are touched on. The attacks of those shows are also very reflective of Saint Seiya and two other animes from its decade (DBZ and Fist of the North Star.) Even Yakitate\
          \
        Japan uses ideas born in Saint Seiya, but obviously in a more satirical way...\
The animation for this series is obviously going to seem dated because of the poor frame rate and some jerkiness in its presentation. However new masters have been made available recently and I had a chance to get a look at them. Overall, it has stood the test of time fairly well. The only things that might be a problem for some viewers are the (as mentioned above) poor frame rate, repeated footage but also the fact that some episodes have inconsistent artwork.\
Overall, these series has beautiful character designs for both the boys and the girls AND some beautiful backgrounds to match. It's just that some episodes reflect those better than others. Of course, at the time the series was made and with the demand for more episodes, its fidelity to the art is amazing. It does not make the characters look cheap so that they stay on budget. This already makes it better (animation wise) than later shows like Ranma or Naruto where the quality just drops as the series progresses.\
In the second and third series of Saint Seiya (criminally not given their own sections by most sites) the animation quality raises a bar. The artwork looks a lot cleaner and sharper. The saints are given better armors (or cloths) to fight in. The backgrounds are even more detailed (the Asgard series just looks breathtaking).\
The sound of Saint Seiya is made up of JRock intros, JPop outro and symphonic compositions within the episodes (with vocals on some tracks). Overall, this gives the series a magnificently epic feel as all types of music are produced incredibly well to suit the mood/s of the show. Soldier Dream is the stand out vocal track for me. The stand out composition in a sea of greatness is Athena's Theme. The only reason I did not give sound a 10 is because these symphonies are reused a few times and as lovely as they are to hear, I just kept wishing for more of them. This does not mean the series is a one trick poney as it does have about 13 soundtracks at last count.\
The story is what will get you into this series as first. As the synopsis describes it is about a war for humankind (yeah I know, a cliche in today's anime climate but not so much at the time it was made). The interesting thing about this though is that it uses mythological aspects to move the story along. A lot of mythologies are explored, with the obvious ones being Greek, Norse and Bhuddist. The saints themselves wear armors that are derivative of mythologies but in an astrological sense. Like Seiya having the Pegasus armor, Shun having the Andromeda armor or Algol having the Medusa armor.\
The best thing about the story is how it manages to keep a lot of mysteries to itself in the first series (the Sanctuary Arc) as you do not know if the protagonists are actually right until about episode 50. Preceeding episode 50 are wonderful episodes that develop the characters so well that its climax just moves you to tears.\
The second and third series have different stories that are persued but despite the length (25 and 15 eps respectively) they still maintain the epic atmosphere and have some of the most touching characters in all of anime.\
The characters in the Asgard series are probably the best antagonists (as a group) that anime has to offer. They are marvellously well developed so that you feel their triumphs and failures like they were transcending you. Mime, Fenrir, Thor and, Syb and Bud are the best of that cast and their respective stories have the potential to move you to tears (Think Now and Then Here and There). The best part of it is how they actually affect our leading team of five (Seiya, Shun, Shiryu, Hoyga and Ikki) which makes them connect with us even more.\
The main five are also very successful characters. Of them my favourite is Shiryu because of his values and willingness to sacrifice himself. Shun and Hyoga are close seconds as they have interesting backstories and a powerful bond. Ikki has a very interesting personality that is developed very successfully as the series goes. Seiya, although the main, is my least favourite of the five as he is a little childish and annoying (yet, still well developed). I have grown to like him a lot more with the newer releases of the series though.\
The great thing about this series is that you are sure to connect with at least one of the characters as there are quite a few of them and, even ones that don't feature for very long have enough of a story that you don't feel they are a waste of time.\
The sanctuary arc has Aphrodite, Camus, Shura, Saga, Shaka, Shaina, Cassios, Aiolia and Aldebaran as stand outs for various reasons I do not want to spoil. The poseidon arc has Krishna, Scylla, Lymnades, Canon and Poseidon himself to keep you interested. All these characters are so well done that some of their characteristics have become cliches. So you should watch Saint Seiya to see where it all starts.\
I own this whole series and it a definitely a must see. If you're unsure as to whether you will like it, ADV Films is releasing an affordable thinpak with the first 30 episodes for you to decide whether it is your cup of tea. Also try www.rightstuf.com for good deals on the singles. I think they are something like $5 at the moment for 5 episodes a disc, which is amazing value.\
I thoroughly enjoy this show everytime I rewatch it as a whole or in parts so I think all of you shounen fans will find something to like too. The chracter design also allows for a few bishounens so the girls are thought of as well. \

    Well,  perhaps I'm one of those self-declared #1 fans. I can't tell exactly how many times I rewatched this series. All I know is that there were lots of times. So maybe now I can act like a kind of advertiser for the series.\
I'd start saiying that Saint Seiya was my introdution to the world of anime. The story, the characters, the myth, the bloody and very impressive fights, the dilemmas the characters had to go through, all created a perfect and attractive piece of something I wasn't used to watching. I kinda compare it to the influence that the american music exerted over\
          \
        me. I wasn't a music enthusiast untill I heard Mariah Carey for the first time. I mean after watching Saint Seiya, I experienced the kind of excitement that an animation could 'cause and became an otaku.\
Let me try my very best to describe Saint Seiya:\
The story\
It's about goddess Athena, who reincarnate on the earth every 200 or 300 years to protect it from the aproaching evil, and her saints, who are, in most of the cases, teenagers. \
The Saints\
There are three different ranks of saints. Bronze saints(the lower rank), silver saints and the highest rank, that happens to be the gold ones. The five saints who are around Athena(in her current reincarnation as Saori Kido) in almost the whole series belong to the lower rank. Though they're supposedly the weakest ones, they manage to overcome even the gold saints in order to protect they're goddess. If you watch it, you'll find out sometimes that it's kinda hard to believe that those boys(Seiya, Shiryu, Hyoga, Ikki and Shun) could achieve such level of power, performing miracles to the point that they don't seem to be simple humans anymore.\
The cosmos \
Every saint has his own guiding constellation in wich the power of they're cosmos(something like chakra in Naruto's world) is based. As it's explained trough the series, the cosmos has no rank. So even a lower rank saint could master it and become strong enough to fight and defeat the gods. \
The music\
There's also a lot to comment about the musical themes of the series. I kinda can't get those songs and arranges out of my mind. The one I like the most is that one played in the end of every episode, causing you that anxiety for the next episode that keeps you always coming for more. For myself, I can say that Seiji Yokoyama did an amazing job in composing the soundtracks.\
Another Shounen animes\
If you liked Naruto, Fullmetal Alchemist, Hunter x Hunter, Dragon Ball Z, etc. Then you won't be wasting your time and Iencourage you to watch this amazing anime that h ad a huge influence over my entire life. Though it's not visually impressive as the ones I've just mentioned, it's still worth it watching. Belive me you won't regret.\
I'm gonna finish it now, 'cause I'm afraid that this review could be so boring that you guys can't bear reading it 'till the end. That's it for now. Hope I have helped you get to know one of the best series out there.",

    Story and Characters\
What really appealed to me about this story was the inclusion of Greek mythology and the use of the constellations to each represent a guardian to Athena. As a modern day re-telling of those qualities, I find that it's adapted very excellently. I like how the concept of chains for lets say Andromeda is transitioned from the original mythology to the character Shun, and of course everybody knows what the legend of the phoenix is, and its used very conveniently with the character Ikki. If you pretty much know the original Greek stories on a basic level, I say it can add a\
          \
        bit more to the enjoyment. If you're expecting something very accurate and 100% faithful, don't bet on it. Keep in mind this is a semi-retelling of Greek mythology with some Asian cultural twists to it which add a unique element to it in that sense. \
The pacing can be slow, but very spread out. The amount of episodes put into this series allows each character to have their own contribution to the story, as well as to have their own individual and relationship development. For example, the main character, Seiya, wants nothing to do with being a saint for Athena, and wants to find his long lost sister. But after awhile, he discovers that he can use his role to hopefully have his sister also find him early on in the series. But after a short while, Seiya comes to embrace his role as Earth's protector. But it's not only interesting that Seiya only develops, but the rest of the cast and even some of the villains have their own unique development as well. And when you get to know some of the characters in an individual sense, you do get drawn to them because of how well they are presented with their personal traits and background. \
The personalities of the main cast overall can be considered stereotypical by modern day standards with Seiya as the act now/never think leader; Ikki as the lone wolf; and Shun as the more soft and feminine guy, but at least the chemistry is balanced and each character can be a foil to one another. Anybody can be a foil to Seiya in the group, and Seiya can be a foil to anybody and so on. \
Of course being a Shounen Jump adapted anime, there are its share of fillers. The worst part about this series is certainly the Steel Saints. I felt their concept really negated what Saint Seiya was about with manipulating the cosmos in your body and really cheapened the value of that. But thankfully they are only in a few episodes and they disappear without a trace never to be seen again. But after the Sanctuary Arc, there is a filler arc called the Asgard Arc where the Bronze saints must fight the God Warriors inspired by Norse Mythology. I felt this is one filler arc that I found to be very productive and in some ways advanced and contributed to the development of the story, and finds a way to connect the last story arc of the anime TV series. I thought the respective characters were an excellent represenation of the myths they were adapated from and matched up very well with the Bronze saints. \
Art and Animation\
I have to say is that I really liked how the design of the characters and I find to be a bit better than the original manga version. I like how it feels more \"cleaned up,\" and not as rough looking. Granted Saint Seiya is an action series, but the way Kurumada inks makes it difficult for me to follow sometimes. Then again, I got bad eyes. I like how the anime makes the characters faces a bit wider and more circular. In that sense, the characters come across more convincingly as teenagers. In the manga, I wouldn't believe that Seiya was thirteen, while in the anime, I believe he can. I also like how Ikki kind of looks like a Nagai Go design. It really makes him stick out and suits his big frame since Nagai liked to sometimes design characters like that. Sometimes I wonder if Ikki was meant to be a tribute to Nagai Go's style. \
Of course what some people may have problems with is Shun's design. I'll admit that I first thought he was a girl looking at the pictures. His face, his figure, the design of his armor just makes you think he's a girl. Apparently thanks to this design of Shun, it pushed way for yaoi. Not only did Kurumada-sensei pave way for Shounen Jump with his original manga, Ring ni Kakero, his creation of Shun paved way for yaoi. Kind of interesting that Kurumada is the father of both Shounen Jump and yaoi. I don't know why I can forgive Shun for looking like a girl, I guess in series like these, you may not directly need a woman, but a guy with a feminine side and Shun fills that role very well. \
What also makes this series very appealing is of course the various designs of the armor that ALL the characters wear. A good fraction of the armor isn't of course 100% accurate to what you see in Greek mythology, but I felt it works with the characters' individual builds, along the way the action and the individual techniques are performed with more emphasis on speed. The armors well represent their respective constellations, and I like when they don't wear their armor, the pieces will form the constellation they represent. \
Another thing that sticks out to met before I talk about the action is of course the design of the God Warriors and the Asgard characters in general. Obviously they were not designed by Kurumada, and their coloring is a lot lighter and brighter, and their hair is much thinner compared to how Kurumada draws more wild and thicker hair styles. The designs reminded me of a Josei style manga. But I suppose it does allow more diversity to the style of Saint Seiya if you want to look at this more postiviely. But lets move on. \
Another high and low point of this series is the action. A lot of recycled animation is used, but Saint Seiya of course isn't the only hit anime series guilty of this feature so I think myself along with a good amount of fans can forgive that. The fighting is explosive with some super bad ass techniques, but not to a point where it gets ridiculously over the top. Despite the more emphasis on special moves, the fights are still strategic, and I like how the concept of styles makes fights is applied here. For example, one character can't beat this guy because of such and such, but this character may be able to beat this bad guy because they have a technique or a feature with their cloth in which it gives them the opportunity to win. So in some ways, it makes you feel that this character isn't the strongest amongst the saints and so on. It's all about who matches up with who. \
And I have to say that Saint Seiya has some of the coolest techniques I have ever seen in action anime. I think some of the techniques used in this anime are way cooler than what you see in Hokuto no Ken and Dragon Ball Z. So, if you want to see some cool action with some sweet moves and bad ass looking armor, then Saint Seiya is for you. \
Music and Voice Acting\
All I have to say is that Pegasus Fantasy by MAKE-UP is certainly one of the best opening themes of an anime in history. If anybody is going to make a top anime theme list, you are no true anime fan if this song is not on your list. The opening guitars just insantly grab you by the balls and the drum beats are catchy. The singing is very energetic and passionate, and the lyrics pretty much tell you the basics of what Saint Seiya is, and that it's about masculinity, the burning fire of youth being a hero,and kicking ass. It's just the talent of MAKE-UP just makes it sound so epic. If I were a pro-wrestler or professional fighter, this would certainly be my top choice of an entrance song just like how MMA fighter Josh Barnett comes out to Ai Wo Torimodose from Hokuto no Ken. The song is so awesome that this French guy went on French Idol, and actually sang it. Granted he wasn't a great singer, but I felt from his posture and his tone, that his inner cosmos igniting for the world to see made up for his lack of talent. Hell, I think he's far more talented than a majority of idiots who go on shows like that anyway. \
The second opening theme, Dream Warrior sung by Kageyama Hironobu, who is also famous for doing the songs for Dragon Ball Z is also excellent in its own right though I don't think it compares to Pegasus Fantasy. The ending themes tend to be more relaxed and is a good way to cool the audience down after seeing the intensity of what this show has to offer, so it shows another good balance to the series. It still tells the same stories of living out your dreams and being a myth come to life. \
The voice talent consists the best of what anime has to offer. I'll admit the one seiyuu who impressed me most was Horikawa Ryo, the voice of Vegeta from DBZ, as the voice of Andromeda Shun. With Vegeta, he's always angry and hostile and is ready to kick somebody's ass. While as Shun, he's very soft, feminine, and a pacifist. His acting is so convincing as this character, it makes it very hard to believe this guy would later voice Vegeta. It just shows how well talented he is. Another great name is of course the voice of Seiya himself, Furuya Tooru, who is world known as the voice of Amuro Ray from Gundam, and as Tuxedo Mask from Sailor Moon. His talent allows Seiya to be very young and yet masculine and hot-headed. The late great Suzuoki Hirotaka, famous for playing Captain Bright from Gundam, Kaifun from Macross, Kuno from Ranma, and Saitou Hajime from Rurouni Kenshin plays Shiryu. He makes him sound calm and contemplative. And I can't deny the presence of Ikeda Shuuichi as the voice of Milo, The Scorpio Gold Sait. This guy origially played the Mother Fucking Red Comet, Char Aznable from Gundam, and Hiko Seijuro from Rurouni Kenshin. \
As for the many dubs out there, I can't speak much for them. I tried watching the English dub, but I found it horrid with the static acting, and the mispronunciating of names such as Shiryu as She-ru, Hyoga, as Hai-oh-ga, and Saori as Sei-o-ri. I just couldn't get past that. I know that Saint Seiya was already popular in Europe and Mexico, but I can't speak for the dubs of those countries. But as an English speaker and as a mediocre Japanese speaker, I can only speak for the Japanese and English version. But watch this in Japanese, you will get one of the best ensemble voice acting casts of all times. Not just for their names, but for their talents and how they bring their characters to life. \
Overall\
Sadly, despite it's popularity overseas, America was stupid 20 years ago and didn't pick up this series when it had the chance. It could have been a HUGE success and put anime on the map 100% worldwide long before Pokemon and Dragon Ball Z did. But for some reason, somebody just looked over this awesome classic and not many American fans have seen this old school epic, and it's one of the most influentional titles in the history of manga. But you know, that's the way it is. As for who I recommend this to, of course people who love old school for starters. And I say if you love Hokuto no Ken, then you gotta check out this baby. The basic premises are very similiar with using constellations and the presentation of the action is kind of the same but gives a different flavor with a different type of explosiveness. \

    This is my first review so please don't be to harsh on me.\
I became a fan of this series only a couple of years ago because in the US this anime and manga series is ignored probably because of a poorly done dubbing back in the early 2000's. \
The plot involves a group of orphan boys serve the Greek Goddess Athena and they fight with armor that is based on constellations called Cloths and they battle enemies that are in the Sanctuary and they battle other greek gods as well. \
What I like about this series is that the cloth designs are really cool and\
          \
        creative and I like the character designs as well.\
What I don't like is that the characters need more development, most of the time they are serious but there is some comical scenes and I wish that the anime stuck more to the manga, because there is a lot of episodes that are fillers. \
Overall I think it is a good series the fights are good and plus if you are a girl like me that likes Bishounen there is a ton of characters that are like that in this series. Also this series is considered a classic it may not be popular in the US but on other parts of the globe it is.",

    Saint Seiya is quite an interesting manga/anime. Being interested in Greek mythology i thought it would be excellent and some of it was very good. The story was okay and the art was quite good. The story has a mix of typical Shonen manga mixed with Greek mythology and produces a good result. The music was okay but i didn't really like much of it apart from the 1st opening theme.\
One of the main things that stopped me from completely enjoying the series were the character designs. Though i liked Phoenix Ikki and found him an interesting character due to not being a complete hero\
          \
        i hated the characters Shun, Misty and Aphrodite as they looked to feminine. It also gets boring to listen to the main characters always yell out the same special attack names, even if it is common in most Super Sentai series. If you can get past the small amount of flaws and enjoy the plot then you can easily enjoy Saint Seiya.\

    Saint Seiya é foda pelo simples fato de ser Saint Seiya.

    Saint Seiya is a series that ,unfortunately, a lot of people are not familiar with. If you ever have the honor of watching the anime, please do so because I can honestly say that the 3,420 hours you put in won't be disappointing.\
~Story: As you should know, Saint Seiya is a back in the day shounen anime which means it is targeted to young males with a huge emphasis on A LOT of fighting/action and little to no romance. The story is told in a simplistic way, you will never be confused or lost as everything pretty much laid on the table for you. This\
          \
        however does not take away from the fact that it sells soooooo well in the light of it's attempt to be humble and unique.\
~Art: The art style was great, however it was only something that Saint Seiya could pull off back then. The elements they incorporate mesh well seeing as the nature of the universe is superb theme. The art is improved over the course of the anime\
~Sound: Un-f*cking believable, I tried to keep the review professional and strict as possible but I'm sorry they could NOT have found a better voice acting cast or music composer. Unlike a lot of anime, Saint Seiya will leave a lasting impression on your eardrums. There are many notable tracks that play that make the scenes all the more better.\
~Character: I love the way the personalities are set apart. For obvious reasons many characters stuck out more than others. I must say though, the way hierarchical scale is used is very creative. Ranks are intact and that makes the story even more simple. Development in the characters tend to be slow but at least they are not completely flat.\
~Enjoyment: Last but not least I think you will enjoy this anime, give it a chance :D. If I'm wrong, let me know but you have to try it. To be honest I love the charisma that is shown throughout the anime, it portrays everything a anime like this should be. Influence is the way to go. It drives me to never give up in real life.\

    The Story\
\
The story follows five young warriors called saints and a young lady named Saori, who is the reincarnation of Athena. The saints fight their hardest and would give there lives to protect their Goddess Athena.\
Saint Seiya has a Greek mythology  theme to it, the universe itself is set in a Greek world with Greek  Gods. The sacred armor called cloths all the 88 of them are named after the constellations, there last name are replaced by there Greek animal or sign. While Greek myth is the most common theme in this anime, it mixes a bit of other myth's like Norse, Christianity,\
          \
        even Buddhism.\
The majority of the story revolves around five young warriors of Athena, knowing the true identity of Athena's reincarnation. They fight grueling and bloody battles with misguided warriors under the order of the Pope the leader of the warriors of Athena. Through the story they become stronger, find allies and uncover the true plot of the Pope.\
\
\
Characters\
Pegasus Seiya. Seiya is a bit simple minded Goku like character. A warrior that trained most of his life and can come off as dump, do to knowing nothing but fighting. He is the most loyal of the saints and will never stop fighting, even if hes been beaten badly, broken bones, having his senses removed, and fighting characters way out of his league, He will always stand and fight.  Seiya may not the most in depth character but he is likable.\
\
Andromeda Shun. A very kind  and gentle character, even by looks I thought he was female before I watched the series. Unlike the others shun will not try to kill or even heavily hurt another person. cause of  this he comes across as week, but when the situation calls for it he shows he is one of the most powerful of the group.\
Dragon Shiryu. One of the most skilled and level headed of the group. he was trained by the highest tier saints, called a gold saint and uses the most durable Bronze Cloths. He like the others will fight to the death to protect Athena, Shiryu himself often fighting blind and nearly giving his life on more then one occasion. In all Shiryu is a cool and loyal character.\
Cygnus Hyoga. One of the most calculating and battle smart of the Bronze saints. He was also trained under the guidance of gold saint. While he seems to just be quiet and calm, he dose have emotional bond with his master and mother. In all another good character you will enjoy as he develops.\
\
Phoenix Ikki.  By far the most brutal of the bronze saints, Ikki wears the strongest of the bronze cloth the Phoenix cloth. He starts at the beginning of the series as scary and heartless. But the more you learn about his tragic past and the more he develops in the story, you see he has a lighter side to him. Unlike the others he dose not care for Athena and will rarely help at first but he loves and will do anything for his brother shun. His Phoenix cloth gives him the ability to come back from the dead stronger then before, so he is often be the last man standing when facing a powerful enemy. All in all hes a very interesting and badass character.\
\
The Gold Saints. The highest tier of Athena's warriors. The gold saints are one of the most interesting part of the story. They start as enemies, but among them there were those who were fooled by the false Pope, and chose to help. They each have there own reason and backstory for what they do. The conversations and emotional   dialogue between them and the bronze saints are great and lead to some truly epic and moving moments.\
\
Saint Seiya's Pros and Cons.\
\
Cons\
It is a old anime so the animation is very lacking by today's standards.\
\
Characters could be more developed.\
\
While it has a good opening that sets the mood very well for the show, it can be very slow at times.\
\
The same techniques are often used a lot, with the same animation at times.\
\
Anything that was removed from the manga I wish where there.\
\
The worst part and what beings this anime down for me. Filler characters, one group of filler characters that do nothing but slow the anime down and disappear without a trace, as well as replacing a characters role that removes the emotional impact of a great fight in the manga. But that's what happens when you start an anime the same year as the manga.\
\
The Pros\
The music in the anime Is really great and fits very well to whats going on.\
\
Many likable characters throughout, most notable the gold saints who wish you could see more of.\
\
While some may repeat, the techniques are still really cool.\
\
A great mix of action and drama, there are some great emotional moments in this anime that's makes you more invested in the fights.\
\
A great well developed villain.\
\
A great interesting universe, to the powers they have and the mix of myths make the world very interesting.\
While it's not nearly as gory as some other mature anime, it is still very bloody and brutal.\
\
My final thoughts.\
\
This is a good action anime, with some good drama and good characters.\
This is my fav series so I might be bit biased, but if your like me and enjoy old school anime and your into Greek and other mythology's then saint Seiya is a must watch.\

 Perhaps the most reluctant of the bronze saints, Shun is the official Bronze Saint of the Andromeda constellation. He is a merciful soul by nature, and a firm believer in solving problems without causing bloodshed. This creates a sharp contrast between himself and the rest of the Saints: Whereas they will not hesitate to battle when the situation demands it, Shun only allows himself to fight if it's an absolute necessity, or when his almost endless patience wears off. When any of these things happen, Shun becomes an extremely vicious fighter. \
 \
 Shun comes off rather badly in the Movies and \"Asgard\" arc. In almost every fight scene, he almost always loses, and needs his brother Ikki to rescue him (except against Mizar Zeta Syd, the one time Shun defeated a foe in either the Movies or 'Asgard' story). \
 \
 However, in the \"Sanctuary,\" \"Poseidon.\" and \"Hades\" storylines, Shun comes off as a good, if reluctant fighter. In 'Sanctuary', he manages to hold his own against Gemini Saga, and even manages to kill Pisces Aphrodite, both of them Gold Saints. In 'Poseidon', he acquits himself nicely, defeating Io, the Southern Pacific Mariner General of Scylla, and Sorrento, the Southern Atlantic Mariner General of Siren. In 'Hades', he manages to dispatch various opponents. As a result, he comes off looking much better in these arcs than in the Movies or 'Asgard'; though he may be reluctant to fight, he will when he has to, and is just as powerful or skilled as any of the other main Bronze Saints (Shiryu, Hyoga, etc.) \

 One of the truly interesting main characters in the series, Hyoga appears calm, collected, and unemotional. Beneath the surface, however, he is passionate and devoted to his ideals. \
 \
 The one person that forever lives in Hyoga mind is his deceased mother. She died when Hyoga was still very young, having drowned during the shipwreck of a doomed cruise. The ship sunk into the icy ocean, where the extreme cold kept Hyoga's mother from rigor mortis. Throughout the Sanctuary arc, Hyoga is shown to visit his mother periodically by diving into the waters. \
 \
 As a saint born under the Cygnus constellation, Hyoga is able to control and manipulate ice and snow however he pleases. It is also implied that he is the first to wear the Cygnus Cloth in 10,000 years, as the cloth was previously concealed within an iceberg before Hyoga retrieved it. \
 \
 The Cygnus Saint's favorite technique is Diamond Dust (ダイヤモンドダスト, daiyamondo dasuto?), a windy attack that blasts ice and snow at the opponent in a single, concentrated point. Hyoga has used this technique for other purposes, like creating a mirror that reflects certain attacks or performing this attack in the legs of the opponent. \
 \
 Before learning Aurora Execution his most powerful technique is Holodnyj Smerč (ホーロドニースメルチ, Hōrodonī sumeruchi?, Cyrillic: холодный смерч, meaning \"ice tornado\"; renamed \"Aurora Thunder Attack\" in the anime). It is the a technique that captures his Cosmo into a single tornado, of which is unleashed via an uppercut. It is a move that, is in essence, a more powerful variation of \"Diamond Dust.\" The \"Aurora Thunder Attack\" clasps both of Hyoga's hands together as he expels snow and ice at the opponent. \

 Out of all five main characters, Shiryuu is known as the calmest and most collected. His sheer physical strength is the greatest of the bronze saints, with perhaps the exception of Phoenix Ikki.This is reflected in his ability to have won numerous battles without his Dragon cloth. Shiryuu trained at the Five Old Peaks in China to obtain the bronze cloth of the Dragon constellation, and his mentor was none other than senior gold saint, Libra Dohko. \

 Shiryuu sports a large tattoo-like image of a green and white dragon on his back (however it is said in the manga and the anime that it is not a tattoo but is connected to his guardian dragon star and only appears as his cosmo is rising).

 The Greek goddess Athena (spelled in Greek as Ἀ&theta;&eta;&nu;ᾶ and Ἀ&sigma;ά&nu;&alpha;, in the manga and the anime adaptation respectively, and occasionally as Ἀ&theta;ά&nu;&alpha; in both) is one of the main characters in the Manga Saint Seiya, authored by Masami Kurumada, and later adapted to Anime. A character with a substantial importance in the universe of Saint Seiya, she was created by Kurumada based on the mythologic persona of the same name.\
 \
 As in Greek mythology, she is the goddess of wisdom and heroic endeavor, and daughter of Zeus. In Kurumada's mythos, she is sent to Earth by the Olympian gods every 250 years, when evil takes over Earth. Her mission during every one of her incarnations is to restore peace and bring hope, destroy the agent of evil and protect Earth; to do so, she has been assisted since the ages of myth by an army of 88 youths of great strength and courage, whose fists rend the skies and whose kicks split the earth, don radiant holy armor called Cloths, and are known as the Saints of Athena.\
 \
 Athena is said to be by birthright the goddess of battle, but she didn't believe in conquest and only fought defensive wars. She hates weapons, and thus only allows her Saints to battle using their bodies and armors. The only Saint allowed by her to wield weapons is the Libra Gold Saint, and it is only with her permission that the Saints are allowed to brandish the weapons kept by the Libra Saint.\
 \
 She has opposed the ambitions of antagonist deities since the ages of myth in Greece, earning herself the rejection of the other Olympian gods. She has had specially a long-standing conflict with the god of the Underworld, Hades.\
 \
 During her 20th century incarnation she uses the name Saori Kido (城戸 紗織 Kido Saori) as her civilian identity. In the English-language version of the manga and the edited anime she is known as Princess Sienna.\

Even as a child, Ikki was known as the toughest kid of the 100 orphans, and would often defend his delicate younger brother Andromeda Shun from the other children. He could easily be recognized as the strongest bronze saint when it comes to raw power.  \
 Ikki's personality is drastically different than his fellow bronze saints. He is very unlike his younger brother - who is almost the opposite of him: Shun is calm, soft, caring and very emotional, whereas Ikki is harsh, cold, aggressive, and very much of a loner. Fellow bronze saint Wolf Nachi once pointed out that it was very hard to believe Ikki and Shun were related due to the extreme difference in their personalities. \
 \
 As noted by Kanon in the Poseidon arc and by Pandora in the Hades chapter, Ikki's cosmos is unique to him -- it is a cosmos full of hate, anger, and incredible aggression and power, but guided by his love for his younger brother, his friends and Athena. Although he dislikes working in groups, he comes to battle whenever Athena's saints need his help, and is often seen coming in the nick of time to save his younger brother from certain death.This tactic has always been exploited to their advantage, since the enemies are caught by surprise upon meeting/fighting him. He is a noble character, mature, and that does not doubt whenever it's necessary to sacrifice his life for his friends. Ikki is a complex character, very rich in nuances. \

 \
 He is a Gold Saint, guardian of the temple of Aquarius, and also Cygnus Hyoga and Kraken Isaac's master in manga. In the anime, he was the master of the Crystal Saint, who was Hyoga and Isaac's master.\
 \
 Camus is a cold looking Saint, since he believes the Gold Saint, as the strongest among Athena's guards, should never show exasperation or it would draw the people into despair.\
 \
 In the manga, he reveals that he actually knew that the Pope wasn't working under Athena's will, but he still kept working under his orders to fulfill his role as que Aquarius Gold Saint. Even so, he was glad to see his pupil fighting for the real Athena.\
 \
 Since Milo fought Hyoga, he made some quotes about Camus that led the fans to believe they were close friends. Apparently, this was made official since the animation of the Hades saga included more interaction between them and they are depicted as friends in Saint Seiya Episode G.\
 \
 He is named after Albert Camus.\
 \
 Camus, unlike the other Gold Saints, specialized his Cosmo energy not in create power by the movement of atoms, but by stopping the same movement. Due to this, his power consists not in destroying the matter, but in freezing it. Among those warriors who use this kind of ability, Camus is considered the stronger since he is the one who can lower more the movements, creating a lower temperature. Even so, and having mastered the 7th sense, Camus is not able to achieve the lowest possible temperature: the Absolute Zero. In the Hades Arc it seems Camus awakes the 8th sense as he is able to enter the Underworld.\
 \
 Techniques:\
 - Diamond Dust: A basic technique using the freezing Cosmo energy to shot a blast of freezing energy.\
 \
 - Kol'tso: Although Hyoga used this attack sometimes in the original series, it was never said Camus also possessed it until he used in Saint Seiya Episode G. It creates rings of icy wind that encycles the body of the target stopping its movements.\
 \
 - Freezing Coffin: This is a technique used to lock a body inside a block of ice, but since it has a slow realization it probably is not effective against moving targets. Although he commented not even the combined strength of all 12 Gold Saints could break this, Griffin Minos destroyed it with a punch when used as a wall by Cygnus Hyoga. Even so, when someone is locked inside it, the only way to get out is creating a temperature lower than that of the coffin.\
 \
 - Aurora Execution: Camus's most famous and strongest technique, it claimed to be the technique that best uses the freezing power of its user.\

 Anime: ep.10\
 Is a fictional character from the manga Saint Seiya, authored by japanese mangaka Masami Kurumada, and later adapted to anime. He is one of the bronze saint's most trusted allies, and serves as the man who repairs damaged cloths in the early stages of the series.\
 \
 Mu was introduced by Masami Kurumada in vol. 3 of his manga.\
 \
 Under the tutelage of Shion, the Pope of the Sanctuary, Mu was able to become the Gold Saint of Aries at a young age. While all gold saints have a base of psychic powers to some degree, Mu has been stated to possess the strongest raw psychic talent among all living gold saints. This allows him to manipulate his gift to various degrees: psychokinesis, telepathy, teleportation, and various other powers are at his command.\

 Mu is very soft spoken, with a scholarly-like personality; his demeanor is very tranquil and logical, almost as if he is a professor of the Sanctuary. Various official translations of the manga and anime, as well as Mandarin language Saint Seiya fans, tend to refer to the character as 'Lord Mu' or 'Mister Mu'. He is good friends with Taurus Aldebaran, and is very respectful to the 243 yr old master Libra Dohko.\
 \
 Before the start of the series, Mu removed himself from Sanctuary after suspecting that his mentor (and then-Pope), Aries Shion, had been quietly assassinated. He relocated to Jamir, a mystical land that only those with a high level of either psychic or Cosmo power can enter. From here, Mu severed all ties to Sanctuary and lived a life of solitude with his apprentice, the young psychic Kiki. It wasn't until years later, when he met Dragon Shiryu and Pegasus Seiya, that he began to become involved in the affairs of Sanctuary again.\
 \
 Throughout the manga and anime series, Mu is the man to go to when a Saint needs his or her cloth repaired. Although every individual Cloth has the ability to regenerate itself after a battle, a hands-on restoration from Mu is needed if a cloth has been severely damaged to the point of death. In normal cases, 1/3 of a person's total blood supply is required for Mu to begin work right away. When restoring an armor, Mu uses hardware tools and the elements that are used to forge a Cloth: the mythical and extremely rare metal known as Gammanium, used in an alloy with the legendary metal Orichalcum, and finally, the radiant Star Dust Sand.\

 Kurumada described Saga and Kanon in his manga (vol.7) as being extremely beautiful. This was probably a reference he made to the myth associated to the Gemini Constellation, which represents Castor and Pollux, brothers of Helen of Troy.\
 \
 Along with Leo Aiolia, Saga disguised as the Pope was the first Gold Saint that Masami Kurumada introduced in his manga, although their rank was revealed until later volumes. In his first appearance, Saga presided the event in which Pegasus Seiya acquired the status of Saint. In the anime adaptation, he was introduced in identical manner, in episode 1.\
 \
 Saga served as the main antagonist for the Sanctuary arc. Being an excellent strategist, Saga managed to put himself in control of the sanctuary (though unfairly) for many years. Before the final showdown between himself and Pegasus Seiya, Saga was portrayed as a mysterious being with his facial features hidden from view.\
 \
 Saga is often described by other characters as someone with the kindness of an angel but with the darkness of a demon. This ambivalence ended up creating a split personality: a good Saga that was extremely loyal to Athena and an evil one that keep the control of the body most of the time and killed the previous Pope to steal his place. Sometimes it is hinted that the creation of his \"bad\" personality had the influence of some external force, although nothing was clearly stated.\
 \
 When it takes the control of Saga's body, his hair turn from blond to jet-black (the color schemes were altered for the anime, in which Saga's normally blue hair turned light grey). Saga's two \"sides,\" can also communicate between them : in a dialogue the good Saga reproaches his evil \"side\" to have forced him to hurt Athena.\

 Kanon is a character with a substantial importance in the universe of Kurumada's manga, and therefore in its anime adaptation. He is directly responsible for triggering two main events:\
 the battle of the 12 temples and the resurrection of Poseidon, Emperor of the Seas. Also, Kanon is notable for redeeming himself after all his sins in the past and wreaking havoc as the new Gemini Gold Saint against the army of the 108 Specters in the battle against Hades.\
 Kanon is the younger twin brother of gold saint Gemini Saga, and later took up his position as a Gold Saint after Saga's death. Before finally embracing his destiny as the Gemini Saint, Kanon masqueraded as the Sea Dragon General, one of Poseidon's seven Sea Generals.\
 \
 At first, Kanon was depicted as a treacherous man, always tempting his twin brother to use his status and power to advance his status of influence beyond that of a Gold Saint. He concluded that their amazing and powerful abilities were gifts from the Gods for them to take advantage of. Much to his dismay, his brother opposed this and caused his incarceration at Cape Junion. After his redemption, however, Kanon becomes a much centered person, much like his brother.\
 \
 Kanon was the one person responsible for Poseidon's awakening, although he kept Poseidon just half awakened so that he could pose as the true leader of the Marines as a Marine General and use Poseidon's army to achieve his desires. In order to do so, Kanon stole the scales of Sea Dragon and pretented to be the Sea Dragon General under Poseidon's order.\
 Even after joining forces with the Athena, Kanon retains his ruthless personality and harsh characteristics scolding Pegasus Seiya and Andromeda Shun that they should never hesitate to finish their enemies, because their hesitation is a weakness that their enemies would take advantage of. Even so, he quickly absorbs the honor of a Gold Saint.\

Convinced of his superiority, Misty had no doubt he would defeat Seiya without even being hit. The Lizard Saint believed he was the most beautiful Saint, and to be injured would be an ultimate insult to him. Using the barrier he created with his technique, he managed to block every single hit of Seiya's Pegasus Ryu Sei Ken. Annoyed that Seiya's blood dripped onto his Cloth, he decided to bath himself in the sea, believing Seiya was defeated.\
 \
 However, Seiya got back up, and continued his battle against Misty. Misty still managed to easily block Seiya's Pegasus Ryu Sei Ken. But Seiya focused the power of all his Ryusei Ken into one, and unleashed his new technique: Pegasus Suisei Ken, which managed to strike through Misty's defense to hurt him. Seiya then used the Pegasus Rolling Crush to finally defeat the Silver Saint. \

 Algol was a Silver Saint sent to destroy the Colosseum that the \"Galaxian Wars\" tournament took place in and kidnap Saori Kido. After Crow Jamian perished at the hands of Phoenix Ikki, Algol, Capella and Dante revealed themselves. The Phoenix Saint warned the other Bronze Saints that Algol was different from his friends, and Algol soon turned Andromeda Shun into stone with the Shield of Medusa, which could petrify opponents when it opened its eyes. \
 \
 Algol then battled with Dragon Shiryū, but was outsmarted when the Dragon Saint blinded his eyes with his own fingers so that he could not see the Medusa Shield, as last resort to stop Algol and save the other Bronze Saints' lives. After a lengthy battle, Algol charged for a final attack, but was in the end defeated by Shiryū, who heightened his Cosmo to \"see\" beyond his blindness.\

 Pisces Aphrodite is the last of the Gold Saints introduced by Kurumada in his manga, formally presented in vol.11. Aphrodite was a Saint famous not only because of his incredible, mesmerizing beauty, but also for his reputation as one of the strongest among the 88 Saints. However, this reputation is not explored very well in the series itself, as he is killed by Andromeda Shun rather easily by Gold Saint standards, and is beaten rather easily by Aries Mu during the Hades Saga.\
 \
 Gold Saint Gemini Saga once stated that Aphrodite's beauty was the greatest among Athena's Saints. Kurumada named him after the Greek Goddess of love and beauty as a reference to the Greek myth associated to the Pisces constellation. However, Aphrodite never claimed to be the most beautiful creature, unlike the Silver Saint, Lizard Misty who claimed that even the stars' splendor dimmed next to his glory.\
 \
 It is notable that despite his incomparable beauty, Aphrodite is not narcissistic. He is often described as cruel as his fellow Gold Saint, Cancer Deathmask, but not as sadistic. He is also ironic and sarcastic. According to Saga, despite his beauty, Aphrodite is the most feared of all the 88 Saints of Athena, however, as explained above, this may be due to his cruel nature as opposed to his fighting prowess. His reputation is supported more in the still non-canonical Saint Seiya Episode G, when Aphrodite appeared in front of the Titan's soldiers who were awe-struck due to his beauty but also paralyzed by fear in his presence.\
 \
 A recurring motif in the Pisces Saint is that he considers victory as the greatest beauty of all and, therefore, he believes what makes him really beautiful would not be his physique, but absolute power. Aphrodite is depicted as a man who believes the power is the only way to keep the order and assure the justice. Subscribing to this theory, he believes the stronger is allowed to rule over the weak.\
 \
 Some casual fans believe Aphrodite is a female because of his name. In the French, European Spanish&mdash;first dubbing&mdash;and Chinese dubbing of the anime adaptation, he is voiced by a female actress.\

The Pope attacked Aiolos, but he managed to escape from the Sanctuary, leaving Athena and the Sagittarius Gold Cloth to the care of Mitsumasa Kido. \
 \
 Once the Pope Arles was informed of the Galaxian Wars tournament between the Bronze Saints, and that the Sagittarius Gold Cloth was in the possession of the real Athena, he sent some Silver Saints to kill the Bronze Saints. However, the Silver Saints couldn&rsquo;t affirm their rank superiority and were defeated by the Bronze Saints.\
 \
 The Twelve Temple arc spoilers:\
 \
 Later, in the Twelve Temples arc, it's revealed that the man who stole the identity of Pope and tried to kill Athena was Gemini Saga. In order to steal the throne and disguise himself as the Pope, Saga killed the previous one, Aries Shion.\
 \
 From this day onwards, Saga ruled the Sanctuary as the Pope Arles. In his favor, most of the Saints didn't know of Shion's murder and Saga's betrayal. Some of them knew it, but silenced about it.\
 \
 At the end of the battle of the Twelve Temples, Saga revealed his identity as the Pope to Seiya. It's also revealed that Saga suffered from a split personality disorder: his evil side was dominant, and lead the Sactuary as the Pope Arles. When his good side finally took control of his body, Saga committed suicide in shame.\

 However, the Bronze Saints realize they are all illusions and Seiya easily defeats him. There is yet only one golden real arrow that he shot, which hits Saori right in the chest. Before he dies, he tells them they must reach Pope Ares in less than 12 Hours so that he can remove the arrow before it pierces Saori's heart\

      firstname = "Aioros",
      role = "Supporting",
      lastname = "Sagittarius",
      description = "When Aioros was 14 years old, he, along with fellow gold saint Gemini Saga, were summoned to Pope Shion's throne room for an audience. There, the Grand Pope revealed that their goddess had once again reincarnated in the form of an infant, and so the Sanctuary must prepare itself for the imminent wars. As Shion himself was getting on in years, he decided that it was time to appoint one of the twelve Gold Saints as the successor to his seat. At the time, most of the Gold Saints were still too young; only Gemini Saga and Sagittarius Aioros were most qualified. The Pope eventually selected Aioros as the new Pope, and asked Saga to serve as an assistant to the Sagittarius Saint. \
 Saga, possessed by his evil side, became jealous at the fact that he was not chosen for the seat, especially since he believed that he was superior to Aioros in terms of power and wisdom. Saga confronted Shion regarding his decision and killed him. He disguised himself with the Grand Pope's garments, and left to kill the infant Athena. Inches before Saga could dig the golden dagger into the baby's belly, Aioros appeared and halted the blade from striking the death blow. The Sagittarius berated the man he assumed to be the Pope, but was quickly shoved aside. After a minute of struggle, Aioros sent Saga flying into the nearest wall, knocking off his headdress and mask. Upon seeing Saga's face and realizing that Saga had killed the Grand Pope, Aioros immediately snatched away the infant Athena and ran off from Sanctuary.\
 \
 Saga, disguised as the Pope once more, sounded the alarm and sent guards to go after the saint. It is at this point that he officially branded Aioros as a \"traitor.\" He was eventually found by Capricorn Shura and managed to flee, but was deadly injured.\
 \
 As he was dying, he ran into Mitsumasa Kido, who was touring Greece at the time. Aioros begged the elder Kido to become Athena's new guardian, and explained to him the travesty that had taken place at the Sanctuary. Along with other secrets, Kido learned about the existence of Athena's Saints and their Cloths. Entrusting the elder Kido with Athena and his own Sagittarius Gold Cloth, Aioros succumbed to his injuries. It is unknown as to where exactly Aioros died and buried, as the whereabouts of the location is omitted in the series.\
 \
 After his death, Aioros' spirit would provide assistance for Athena and her Saints. He has aided Seiya in battles by lending the young bronze saint the Sagittarius Gold Cloth time and time again, and even appeared once to his brother Aiolia during Aiolia's fight with Seiya, when he demanded proof of Saori's identity as the goddess Athena. When the bronze saints were in the Temple of Sagittarius, the Sagittarius Cloth moved on its own (or with Aioros' spirit), and fired its golden arrow into a nearby wall&mdash;revealing a final hidden message of the gold saint's last will: \"To you young boys who have reached this temple, know that I entrust Athena's life in your hands. Aioros.\" It is likely that Aioros foresaw that one day, new Saints would go to his temple to fight for Athena.\
 \
 When Athena's saints were once again fighting against Hades's spectres, all the Gold Saints, both dead and alive, gathered in Hades' room to break the Wailing Wall. Only with sunlight can the wall be destroyed, and because each individual gold cloth contained a bit of solar energy, gathering all twelve would provide enough of it to properly damage the wall. At this point, the spirit of Aioros appeared with the rest of the recently deceased Gold Saints to aid their comrades in accomplishing this task. Focusing on a single point of the Wailing Wall, Aioros guided all twelve gold saints' individual attacks into one, and struck the wall. Once the mission was completed, Aioros and the rest of the gold saints dissipated, leaving only the gold cloth behind.\
 \
 Although Aioros' moves were not shown in the original manga, there are nevertheless two techniques that were attributed to him in other mediums: one in the anime adaptation, and another in Episode G.\
 \
 They are:\
 - Atomic Thunderbolt (atomikku sandāboruto): Aioros shoots a massive amount of energy balls with some electric charge. This attack is from the anime, and was revealed during a flashback fight against Capricorn Shura.\
 - Infinity Break (infiniti bureiku): This technique allows Aioros to shoot an infinite number of light darts that pierce anything upon contact. With this attack, Aioros destroyed Horus' army in Saint Seiya: Episode G.\
 \
 Aioros' cloth, Sagittarius Cloth, is armed with a bow and a golden arrow. This arrow is often depicted as the main weapon of the series and gives the final blow in four of the five movies of the series when is used by Pegasus Seiya. It was hinted on the original series and confirmed in Saint Seiya Episode G that the golden arrow can concentrate the Cosmos of those surrounding it if they wish.\
 \
 Even though most fans recognize his given name as Aiolos, the true intention of Masami Kurumada was to name him Aioros, a Japanization the name of the Greek god of the winds Aiolos. This can be confirmed in vol.11 of Kurumada's manga, in Aioros' testament. Kurumada drew capitalized Greek letters spelling the character's name as Aioros: &Alpha;Ἰ&Omicron;Ῥ&Omicron;&Sigma;. He clearly used a \"R\" instead of an \"L,\" in the spelling of the name. If he had wanted to spell it Aiolos, he would have drew them as: &Alpha;ἴ&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; or &Alpha;Ἰ&Omicron;&Lambda;&Omicron;&Sigma;. Some attribute the discrepancy to the fact that in Japanese, the letter \"L\" doesn't exist, and is replaced by the letter \"R\" in foreign words. The fandom in general is mostly familiarized with the more \"Greek\" spelling, Aiolos, though in some languages, such as in the Latin-American Spanish dub of the anime, the arguably more Kurumada-accurate \"Aioros\" is used.\
 \
 As revealed by Masami Kurumada in vol.12 of his manga, Aioros became a Gold Saint at an early age. He had already been granted the Gold Saint status and the Sagittarius Gold Cloth before the time he was 14 years old.\

 The second Bronze Saint to appear in the story was Jabu the Unicorn Saint. As a fellow orphan he had been sent out with 99 more of his brothers by their father Mitsumasa Kido. He achieved the Unicorn Cloth in Algeria and returned to Japan to participate in the Galaxian Wars tournament to receive the Gold Cloth of Sagittarius. He easily defeated Lionet Ban in his first match but was outmatched against Andromeda Shun whose chains proved impenetrable. He returned to his master in Algeria to further his training, and during this time his Cloth came to upgrade itself as well. When Saori Kido had been shot by a golden arrow, he came to her rescue and protected her from the then antagonistic forces of the Sanctuary. After that he came to reside in the Sanctuary and protected it against the Saints Hades had revived, and protected Pegasus Seiya's sister Seika from the attacks of the god of death.\

 Shaka is one of the Twelve Gold Saints. As the guardian of the Temple of Virgo along the path of Sanctuary, Shaka has played a pivotal role chiefly in the battle between Athena and the Pope in the Sanctuary arc, and also in the Hades arc. He is referred to many times on the story as the \"the man who is almost a god\" (or closest to attain godhood) due to his immense power and is also considered the only Gold Saint that has full control over the Araya Shiki (8th sense).\
 \
 Shaka alone of all saints occupies the rarefied spot between God and man, but living between two worlds has its blessings as well as curses. As a Bodhisattva, and endowed with the most powerful cosmos of all the saints even overpowering Libra Dohko's and Aries Shion's Cosmos, Shaka well deserves his reputation as the man closest to God. Even as a child in India, Shaka was precocious and communed with God himself--a scene recounted in the flashbacks moments before Shaka's death in the Twin Sala's Garden. For someone whose life has just begun, he had been unusually sensitive to sufferings and mortality of human life. Seeing pain and death as reflected in the Ganges gives the boy Shaka enough despair, if not a crisis of faith. With esoteric learning and training, Shaka eventually became powerful enough to don the Gold Cloth of Virgo, which he wore even as a boy in the manga, and wise enough to rise above human passions and attachments. For most of his life, he would look on human feelings with a mix of pity and compassion without being bound to them, with charity but not always with love. Detachment seems to be Shaka's answer to the poignant questions raised by human life, and he is seeing humanity from the point of God rather than living the experience. He would be disabused of this attitude in his encounter with Ikki. In the end, Shaka would have to remember that he is a man, as well, and return to whence he came.\
 \
 He often casts illusions to deceive his enemies. A probably illusionary technique is Transmigration (or Reincarnation) to the Six Paths (六道輪廻 Rikudō Rinne?) in which Shaka sends his opponent to one of the six Dharma's rebirth realms. These realms are, as described by Kurumada: Gakikai (the realm of the preta), Jinkai (the realm of humans), Jigokukai (the realm of hell), Chikushōkai (the realm of beasts), Shurakai (the realm of the warring demigods) and finally Tenkai (the realm of heaven). Interestingly enough, Kurumada presents the Buddhist realms of reincarnation as separate planes of existence from those found in the Hades arc of his manga, which he derived from Dante Alighieri's conception of the underworld. The Tenkai is considered the worst realm to be sent as mentioned by Shaka.\
 \
 Shaka strengthens his Cosmos energy by depriving himself of his eyesight. When he opens his eyes, the stored strength is then released. Due to his enormous power, Shaka is called the \"man who is closest to god\". He can also use Hāṃ (カーン Kān?), a defensive technique that creates a barrier that encircles Shaka's body.\
 \
 Between his offensive techniques he can use Demon Pacifier (天魔降伏 Tenma Kōfuku?) to expand his cosmos at multiple targets or at a single one as a blast, that it was strong enough to destroy a large part of the Cancer Temple and Heaven Supremacy on evil spirits of rivers and mountains (天空覇邪魑魅魍魎 Tenkūhajachimimōryō?) in which Shaka summons minor spirits and sends them against his enemies.\
 \
 Shaka's most powerful move, The Treasures of Heavens (天舞宝輪 Tenbuhōrin?), is an offensive and defensive combined technique. Not only traps and defangs Shaka's victims, it also wipes out their five senses named as \"Remove of the 1st/2nd/3rd/4th/5th sense\" (Dai Ikkan/Nikan/Sankan/Yonkan/Gokan Hakudatsu). Essentially reduces Shaka's victims to living corpses by stopping the main functions of the brain that allows the body to think, also called the 6th sense. The offensive power of this attack is so destructive that it can easily destroy the cloth of the opponent.\
 \
 Apart from those fighting techniques, Shaka also uses two concentration ones that belong to the Hinduism and buddhism like Om(ॐ) to maximize his Cosmo energy, allowing him to use the full extent of his power and Tenpōrin Mudra (転法輪印 Tenpōrin'in?) to erase any doubts in his mind that could refrain him during the fight. Tenpōrin is the japanese name for the Dharmacakra.\

  synopsis = "In ancient times, a group of young men devoted their lives to protecting Athena, the Goddess of Wisdom and War. These men were capable of fighting without weapons—a swing of their fist alone was powerful enough to rip the very sky apart and shatter the earth beneath them. These brave heroes became known as Saints, as they could summon up the power of the Cosmos from within themselves. Now, in present day, a new generation of Saints is about to come forth. The young and spirited Seiya is fighting a tough battle for the Sacred Armor of Pegasus, and he isn't about to let anyone get in the way of him and his prize. Six years of hard work and training pay off with his victory and new title as one of Athena's Saints. But Seiya's endeavor doesn't end there. In fact, plenty of perils and dangerous enemies face him and the rest of the Saints throughout the series. What new quests await the heroes of the epic Saint Seiya saga?",
