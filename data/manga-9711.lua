One day, Mashiro draws a picture of Miho Azuki, a girl he is secretly fond of, during class but forgets the notebook at school. He comes back to find that his classmate Akito Takagi is waiting for him with his notebook. Takagi tries to convince Mashiro to become a manga artist for his stories, leading to Mashiro's disagreement, citing his late manga artist uncle, who died from overworking. Takagi incites Mashiro to meet with Miho Azuki, Mashiro's crush, and tells her the two plan to become manga artists. In response, Azuki reveals her plans to be a voice actress. Mashiro proposes to her that they should both marry when Azuki becomes a voice actress for the anime adaptation of their manga. The two then start creating their manga, under the pen name Muto Ashirogi, in hopes of getting serialized in Weekly Shounen Jump. (Source: Wikipedia)",

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=282,  ["text"]="            \n    Shounen Jump. When we think of the famous boy’s manga company, titles such as \"Bleach\", \"Naruto\" and \"Gintama\" usually comes to mind. Most of which are of the ‘battle’ genre. Bakuman is no different; but instead of picking up their swords to rush off to battle, Akito Takagi and Moritaka Mashiro are picking up their pens to rush for their deadlines. A story of making your dreams come true, fighting for the one you love and overcoming the many obstacles that stand in your way – all of which that can adhere to your typical shounen title. Only that it is not your typical shounen\n          \n        manga. \nDeath Note duo Takeshi Obata (art) and Tsugumi Ohba (story) collaborate once again to present to us yet unique addition to the manga world: the journey of two upcoming mangakas exploding their way into Shounen Jump; their aim to become the biggest mangakas in their company. The idea itself is quite simple, but it is one that can stretch very far, with many twists, turns, events and new facts learnt along the way.  It is obvious that the story is influenced by Obata’s and Ohba’s own past experiences, making the manga all the more amusing to read as you feel as though you’re reading an exaggerated version of their autobiography. \nIf anything, Bakuman shows off the level of Ohba’s skill. Even people who disliked Death Note could enjoy this because of the complete 180 turn he (or she) has taken since his (or her) previous work. Bakuman is anything but dark and thought provoking, but Ohba still manages to create a catalysed chemical reaction within Bakuman’s world – a near perfect balance between comedy, romance, drama and that subtly blended in slice-of-life quality (which is so rare in Shounen Jump works). \nBut ‘near perfect’ is not ‘perfect’. The twists and turns that are presented are a little weak in comparison with Death Note (although I would like to make it clear that Bakuman should be considered as a SEPERATE work). For example, the most major turn-of-events you are most likely to get is simple, like the revelation of the reader’s poll results or the introduction of another mangaka.  Such twists are to be expected in such a manga though, as there isn’t much to expand on the ‘exciting’ lives of authors and editors. The twists and cliff-hangers, simple as they may be, are effective and exciting nevertheless and to be honest, are much better than the cliff-hangers of other shounen titles (such as Naruto). \nAnother (minor) nitpick I have with the story is the ‘everlasting’ romance between Azuki and Mashiro. I am not particularly fond of the \"love at first sight\" cliché, but what further aggravates me is the strength of their love despite there being almost no basis for it. Then again, I guess most teen love is like that. Despite their arbitrary romance it does become one of the highlights of Bakuman, providing some of the sweetest parts and funniest moments. \nBeing a story about making manga in one of the most successful franchise, Shounen Jump/Shuiesa, it is no surprise that you would learn volumes about the industry, and the process of making manga. Each and every little trivia learnt has become one of the many delights of reading Bakuman; especially because of the depth it goes into and relevance it has to the entire story. Bakuman has very heavy dialogues; it is not like the other battle manga where most of the chapters are full of action.\nThe setting is anything but claustrophobic, as some would think it to be. It differs all the time, from their studio to even the zoo and sometimes to all over town when trying to trail a person (yes, I’m serious here). One time Mashiro simply enjoy a Christmas party round his friends’ house. This all adds to the slice-of-life aspect to the manga which I have enjoyed tremendously.\nThe colourful cast of Bakuman has a very wide range in terms of age, personality, shapes and sizes. One of my favourite things about the characters and story is that it does not solely focus on Takagi and Mashiro’s quest to become the best but shifts its focus onto other editors and authors stories and involvement throughout each chapter. These fluid transitions of focus are matched by Ohba’s skill of juggling all the character’s personalities and making it well balanced. \nAgain however, women seem to be the victim of misogyny by Ohba. Most of the women portrayed in Bakuman are either stupid or stuck up, with the exception of Azuki who lacks so much personality she is basically just a pretty face. As of late however the cynicism to women does lighten, you could call it character development, especially with girls such as the female mangaka Aoki realising her faults and struggling to change. \nAlthough the cast is fun to read about and likeable, you can see how some of the characters are ‘copy and pasted’ from Death Note: we have the quirky antagonist where the line between friendship and rival is often blurred; the stuck-up and prideful female classmate and bouncy love-struck girl for Takagi. Even Mashiro, the primary lead is lost in the quirk-filled and humorous cast. Nevertheless, the fact that the cast is as wide as it is compensates for this; it almost feels like it’s a hustle and bustle – just like how mangakas and editors lives are.  \nIn addition, Bakuman’s ‘slice of life’ aspect is played mainly through the characters own growth and development. Interestingly enough, Bakuman starts off with two 14 year-old boys but as of recent chapters follows two 20 year-old college students. Yes, they grow! Not just in height but as people too as they take on other challenges in life such as marriage. They literally grow before your eyes.\nOhba’s charismatic story and characters are equally matched (once again) by Takeshi Obata’s excellent art. His style in Bakuman has changed since Death Note to better suit the lighter, more shounen tone of the story, but it still retains that high level of detail and clean cut edge in his drawings. Obata does exhibit a weak point when it comes to drawing female characters though. But his weakness is another artist’s forte; even though I have just classed it as a weakness it is still so good, that it can exceed another manga artist on their best day. \nI was also surprised at how well Obata can employ comic drawings as well as serious ones. His silly gag drawing actually evoked some hearty laughs from me (of course it was Ohba who wrote them up – who knew both of them could be so funny?). Close ups and tones are all very well used to create an atmosphere or effect of the moment – be it funny or serious. Or seriously funny. Or a serious funny. Okay, okay, I’ll stop. \nObata’s style at panelling makes each chapter a joy to read.  He does not allow each panel to restrict his drawings, which is a personal favourite aspect of his panelling of mine; how the drawings themselves come out of the box and extends further. Of course, this technique would have been meaningless without Obata’s fluent artistic skills. \nI think the main problem with Bakuman is its reader’s expectations. Unfortunately, it is overshadowed and constantly compared to by its predecessor, Death Note. But Bakuman is just as entertaining and unique as its authors’ previous work and is just as wonderful a read in its own right.  As a reader of both works it is quite obvious that there are some influences, the most notable ones lay in the characters; however there is one definite similarity between the two: they are no ordinary shounen. Yes, Bakuman may have the formula for one (Childhood love? Check; Rivals? Check; Quirky characters? Check; Hot girls? Check) but it still displays a lot of characteristics not found in Shounen Jump’s works: Growing up, multiple character storylines, excellent character interaction and life in general. Most importantly, the arcs are never dragged out! (Here’s looking at you Bleach). \nIf you do read Bakuman, read with an open mind and forget about Death Note, for it is not every day we get a work like Bakuman and for it to be ridiculed or downplayed because of its origins would be a sad waste of an excellent work like this. For its genre it is probably the best out there with charm and charisma practically oozing out of the pages. \nEvery week Mashiro and Takagi are closer to realizing their dream, and every week we are there with them in their exciting journey. We explore the world of mangakas, editors and voice actors alike and to all that are close to them. So as they grab their pens to rush for that deadline I shall be rushing to the store to grab my copy of this week’s Shounen Jump.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=102,  ["text"]="            \n    Anyone who has ever written a novel, drawn a picture, made a movie will tell you the creative process is fraught with blood, sweat and tears. It requires courage to put your name out there, trusted friends who will give you honest critique and advice, and a relentless dream to see your vision through. Courage, friendship and dreams... so why did it take so long for someone to realize the creative process could easily be turned into a manga for Shounen Jump? No worries, because now we have Bakuman, a manga about writing manga that fits the ticket in spades\nFollowing the story of Moritaka \"Saikou\"\n          \n        Mashiro and Akito \"Shujin\" Takagi, two boys who meet in middle school and strive to become successful mangaka in the world under the pen name \"Ashirogi Muto\", they strive against insurmountable odds to make their dreams come true, and in Mashiro's case, make a manga so good it becomes an anime so the girl of his dreams Miho Azuki can voice the heroine, and then marry her. There's nothing complex or challenging about it. The story, at its heart, is pure straightforward Jump ideology, rewarding perseverance and guts tenfold, but its the subtext behind Bakuman that really bring the story to its full potential.\nAside from its main goal-driven narrative of Ashirogi Muto becoming the best mangaka in Japan and Mashiro marrying Azuki. Bakuman is an unflinching critique of the manga industry that gives readers some serious glimpses into the pros and cons of publishing manga. Clashing with editors, dealing with copycat authors, the hectic schedules of weekly publishing, how much control the publisher has over how long you have to keep writing the same manga, and those ever important RANKINGS all get exposed. The point-of-view is generally positive, but still eye-opening for most casual fans of the medium. And even outside all that, many of the in-story manga, especially Classroom of Truth, have incredible and intriguing plots that beg to be turned into manga here in real life.\nHowever, it is a Jump manga, so there is quite a bit of misogyny, especially early on. Female characters aren't portrayed strongly until well into the manga, and Miho especially comes off as a very sexist MacGuffin at the beginning. The series works hard in the back end of things to round out the female characters and give them ample time to shine, but it feels more like author Tsugumi Ohba gives them that growth half-heartedly. The male characters are given a far more vast range of characterization traits and personalities, many of which are memorable, especially bizarro genius Eiji and pessimistic slacker Hiramaru.\nForgiving the story for its misogynistic leanings though is incredibly easy when you get down to artist Takeshi Obata's share of the work. It starts off detailed as can be, but gets much simpler by the final chapters, but even that can be forgiven when one takes into account the multiple and numerous art shifts he single-handedly performs over the course of the series. We see no less than ten, if not closer to twenty different Jump manga from all different artists portrayed with varying art styles. It is astounding to see one man create multiple unique art styles for his characters, and most importantly, sell us on the authenticity. Reading Bakuman is worth it for that alone.\nDon't get me wrong. This manga isn't without its weaknesses, but its strengths far outweigh them. With a decent straightforward main story, many ingenious in-story manga, characters that all grow in their own ways, and the underlying critique of the workings of the manga industry, Bakuman is a can't-miss manga for anyone who loves the medium.\nOverall, I give Bakuman a 9/10.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=71,   ["text"]="          \n    Bakuman is a pretty unique story. I've never read or heard of any other story like it. \nStory: The story starts out in a weird way. It gives you the feeling that it's going to end up like another typical Shounen series (lame main character who mysteriously gets an interesting life with all kinds of fantasy and supernatural aspects), but that will change quickly. After a quick reference to the author's previous work (Death Note, ever heard of it? :P), we begin to learn the basis. Mashiro is just your average 9th grader, but when he accidentally leaves his notebook in school, he ends up\n          \n        running into another classmate that would pretty much change his future. This other classmate, Takagi, basically says that he likes how Mashiro can draw and wants to know if he would draw manga for him, while Takagi writes the stories. There is also a bit of romance involved, since the girl Mashiro likes wants to become a voice actor in the future. Anyway, from here on in, we see the struggle it takes to become a mangaka.\nArt: I think the art is pretty good. It is straight-forward for the most part, but the detail involved with the manga companies are very well drawn IMO. \nCharacter - More development is needed on the characters, but it is still early when writing this so I'm not worried. The characters are pretty likable and can be quite amusing as well. It fits with the story.\nEnjoyment - I think the main reason why I enjoy this manga is because it is so realistic. I'm so used to reading things that are so far fetched that it can sometimes be annoying. However, Bakuman is so real and you even get references to many other manga series out there (Bleach, Naruto, Gintama, Death Note, and other old time manga that I wasn't so familar with). Plus, you almost feel as if you want the characters to succeed. Also, I think it is really cool that the reader gets to be informed about how hard it is to become a mangaka. Overall, I enjoy this series. ^_^\nOverall, Bakuman is a really real series that can be pretty entertaining. It's definitely a good read. ^^\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=67,   ["text"]="           \n    It looks like Obata and Ohba struck gold again. After the phenomenal success of Death Note, the duo came up with Bakuman, a manga about making manga. While this series is a whole lot different than Death Note, it still maintains Ohba's style of intelligent writing coupled with Obata's masterful artwork(Come on, the guy's gotta move to seinen already). Bakuman's plot isn't really groundbreaking, but the storytelling is one of the best in current shonen manga nowadays. The manga shows us how writing manga for Jump works, how hard it is to even get published, how it is even harder to stay serialized in Japan's\n          \n        most popular shonen magazine. The characters also have their own appeal; Niizuma Eiji with his L-ish mannerisms and quirks, and Miho and Mashiro's strange approach to their pseudo-engagement.However, as good as Ohba's writing is, sometimes his characterizations fall flat. Aside from their unique quirks, they aren't that well fleshed-out and we can't really form a bond with any of them. Takagi, for instance, is perhaps the blandest character in the whole manga while his girlfriend, Miyoshi can sometimes be very grating. Having great characters is very important in this kind of story, since it's not action-y. That aside, the plot moves forward in a straightforward and concise manner as is the style of Ohba. All in all, if you want some intelligence in your shonen manga and a bit of insight as to how the whole industry works, read Bakuman. You won't regret it.\n        "},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=28,   ["text"]="          \n    I could write a ten page review about this series, but I won't. Here are just a few things to note:\n-This manga is about manga.\n-It's by the creators of Death Note.\n-It is WORDY. This is great if you want to prove to your friends or family that manga can have the same merits and require the same brainpower as an actual book, but not good if you are like me and you want to finish your manga as quickly as possible. \n-There are lots of characters in this series. This is good, and it provides a lot of material for fanfiction writers and shippers, but\n          \n        there is a side-effect. There are whole chapters where all of the characters are just reacting to the same information, but in different scenes. This will make more sense once you hit around volume 16. That's when it becomes as noticeable and annoying as a zit that won't go away. In fact, once you get to that point, you could probably just read a few pages per chapter and perfectly understand the story. Or you could briefly scan the page to get the general idea.\n-They bring in a lot of characters to serve as \"obstacles\" for the protagonists and then throw them away once they're no longer of use. \n-The art is nice. It's kind of comical at times, too.\n-I really am not enjoying this series.\n-I recommend this series entirely.\nI say that because it has helped me better understand all anime and manga and has given me a different viewpoint and has helped me to understand the stories from a more critical perspective. I think that's invaluable, which is why I think all manga and anime fans should at least read a few volumes.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="          \n    AKA The manga by the Death Note writer-artist team about... a writer-artist team trying to conquer the world of shounen manga.  LOL!   \nQuick Overview: Shujin (writer) and Mashiro (artist) decide to team up in middle school. They share the same goal, of getting published in Jump, coming in #1 in the popularity polls, and having their work made into a anime so that Mashiro's childhood sweetheart (a would-be voice actress) can play the title role. As in Death Note, the story is fast-paced, especially compared to other shounen manga - after the first three volumes, nearly three years have passed!  \nWriting:\n          \n        As is often the case in the best shounen manga, you can learn something about the field the protagonists are attempting to conquer - in this case, the world of professional mangaka - by reading Bakuman.  There's a lot of actually very good analysis of Jump manga from a business point of view, as well as behind-the-scenes-in-the-editors-room kind of stuff. There's no fantasy wish-fulfillment angle and everything the pair accomplishes together is shown to be the result of hard work.  As in, Shuji and Masahiro really do spend all their time writing manga, drawing manga, discussing manga, and learning the business of manga. And as in, Ohba (the series writer) really does come up with a separate believable (often sci-fi-ish and vaguely familiar) premise for every manga they dream up - premises that are good enough that I would be interested in reading those manga.   \nAnother review mentioned that the characters are shallow.  This is sadly true.  There seems to be a \"Theory of Mind\" failure on Ohba's part here, in that the secondary characters all either agree with the protagonists and support their vision, or are irrational.  That said, the character designs actually vary a lot, so that the characters are all easily distinguished from one another.  They might not have fully realized personalities, but they do have interesting and varied personality quirks. Also, (again as in Death Note) one of my favourite things about this manga is the interaction between the two leads. They act less like friends or collaborators and more like two halves of the same brain, playing off each other, coming up with ideas together, and supporting each other in romance. Who doesn't want a BFF friend like that? \nArt: Bakuman is a good showpiece for Obata (the series artist), since the art changes depending on the flavor of manga currently under discussion - Heavy for the surrealist gag manga author, Loose for the One Piece-ish author, Grafitti for the scenes with the mangaka who does funny violence, Wistful for the former Margaret author,  etc. (Sorry for the non-technical terms: I'm not an artist.) The art is most \"Obata-like\" when he is focusing on the main pair's own story. Although sometimes more sloppy than his work on Death Note or Hikaru no Go, the art is still amazing.  \nDrawbacks: Well, there was that plot line that promoted overwork to the point of hospitalization. (And here I thought a Jump manga that added \"talent, intelligence, luck\" to the \"friendship, hardwork, loyalty\" Jump formula could avoid that trap! Silly me!) However, since I enjoy screaming at the stupidity of counter-productively hard-working shounen heroes, this wasn't really a drawback for me. :)\nMuch more troubling is this manga's  HARDCORE sexism. I sense the hand of an editor, somewhere, in the introduction of the karate-loving girlfriend who beats up the writer every time he says or does something stupid. (Subtle, no! But effective, yes!) However, even the editors can't keep Ohba from sneaking in the misogynist plots and commentary.  \nLet's count the ways in which this title is sexist: Ohba never skips a chance to bash on shoujo manga or dismiss the opinions of female readers (30% of Jump's readership). He doesn't trust pretty girls but automatically dismisses from consideration any girls who are NOT pretty. He allows that girls can be smart but maintains that smart girls have warped and overly assertive personalities. There is a story line centered around \"training\" a shoujo author to do panty shots. There is a story line centered around marrying your girlfriend to shut her up.  \n... To be fair, really bottom of the barrel guys have their characters dragged through the mud, too. But that's just it, there's such a disparity between the basic decency and grooming required of men and the sainthood and flawless beauty required of women, it is absolutely, positively ridiculous.  My only comfort in all this is that while a lot of Jump series are casually sexist, in that there just aren't many strong female characters who play large roles in the story, Bakuman, because it is actively sexist and misogynist, paradoxically includes many more smart, beautiful, capable women whose only failing is that they put up with way too much abuse from Bakuman's sexist pig male characters. \nIn other words, there's actually a degree of realism here not present in other Jump series, which have only weak or passive women. In this case, what the readers see (smart, beautiful, capable women) is quite different from what the author, living within his own neuroses, expects them to see (stuck up bitches). At the same time I despair, because the average Jump reader is still a 15 year old boy, so these kinds of distinctions may be lost. \nBah. Anyway, sexism aside, this is actually a very good manga.  I recommend it especially to people who want to learn more about what it takes to become a Shounen Jump mangaka. Most of all, Bakuman is a pretty good how-to guide for submitting to Jump. Maybe it'll be to Shonen Jump submissions as Hikaru no Go was to professional Go... or maybe detailing the sheer amount of effort involved in becoming a professional mangaka for Jump will scare prospective artists away.  :p\nMy marks off are all for misogyny.  It's too bad, because I otherwise really enjoy this manga. \n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="           \n    Overall\nBakuman is a manga, which story is about the dreams of two tyronic, young boys and the difficulties they plunge into on their way of achieving them. Being a mangaka seems easy to them from the beginning, even though they are tentative and  hesitant about it, they decide to give it a try and the first try's success motivates them to keep going.\nThe two main characters both seem to have the potential, skill and passion to become mangakas, but would it be that easy to break through this business and make living of it? Sleepless nights, missing school, depriving themselves from the carefree life\n          \n        of a normal teenager in the name of being number one..\nWhat I do not like in the story is that one of  the main character's only motivation not to let himself down is the promise of the girl he \"loves\", which is to marry him, only when/if their dreams come true. At moments I was really wondering does he deserves to become mangaka number one, when the passion for drawing lacks..\nOn the other hand the story is helping people to get a very basic knowledge about the whole process of creating a manga comic, which I found most interesting.\nMy personal impressions\nI like this manga, not as much as Death Note and not only because it's from the creators of Death Note. It was very interesting at the beginning, especially the first three chapters. I thought: \" Ha! Obata and Ohba finally decided to make a comedy!\"\nInteresting story, but is it really serious? Looks like it is...which is the worst\nSpoilers:\nI can't stand some of the characters. I can't stand the way Mashiro and Takagi are treating Miyoshi and how she agrees to do everything for them, all the help on a good will. This reminds me a lot of Light and L's discriminative attidude toward Misa.\nI like her, she is definitely a strong character.\nAlso - is it just me or Mashiro is turning into emo  at moments? Shame he is the main character, but couldn't dare to face his beloved Azuki until he got hospitalized and again she made the first step. How manly... \nOh yeah, he really gave up going to see her when she had a bad time because of the photo opportunity,instead of taking the chance. They are so lame. \nTakagi pisses me off too lately. I just can't decide is it a kind of romance or a joke, but I have to admit - got me excited at chapter 47\n"},

The similarity of my dream and the dream of manga`s protagonists made me to read this manga.\nBoth professions - mangaka and writer, are extremelly difficult. Yes, you may distribute your working time as you want, but the work... It's quite unimaginable. It might make tired even adult and well-tried man, no need to speak about children.\nBut here they come - Mashiro Moritaka and Takagi Akito.

Well, my skill of English doesn`t allow me to make a complete review of the storyline)), but really, this manga should be appreciated. \nStory - 10/10.\nAbout the art - I noticed that the quality of drawing is falling from the very first chapters to the current. In some chapters it degrades to primitiveness. But even so, it's not so bad, as we can see in some \"masterpieces\". \n7/10.\nCharacters - well, they`re unique.

But, when I soon realized, that retard like me will never become a great person,  Mashiro and Takagi are still fighting in order to reach their Olymph. May be it will inspire me some day...\n10/10.\nSo, no doubt of its problems, it's a quite perfect manga.\nOverall: 10/10\n"},

Its comical profoundness blends well on how solid the main theme is.\nBasically, it tells a story about two boys who dreams to be mangakas and are willing to give their best shot to be successful in the future. Moritaka Mashiro, who handles the art, commits to his crush, Azuki, that as soon as\n          \n        they get the chance to have their work animated, they’ll get married and with Azuki as the heroine’s seiyuu. Takagi, the writer, though he certainly has the best grades and capacity to study in great universities, decides to work more on the manga with Mashiro and his girlfriend, Miyoshi.\nOf course, this doesn’t revolve with just that.\nBecoming a great and successful mangaka takes a step by step process. Which is clearly depicted here. It isn’t all play. The process takes months, years or maybe even decades.They falter, they rise. Showing us that at a certain point in our lives, we cannot avoid failures. We use them as a stepping stone towards our dreams, making them a reality.\nThe main setting takes place to Nobuhiro Mashiro’s workplace which is soon taken over by his nephew due to his death. It helps more on its flashbacks and the current situation of the lead characters. It’s also another source of information for them inline with the manga they’re making.\nAnother foundation of this is its supporting characters. They build good relationships disregarding the fact that they are rivals in terms of the manga industry. They keep to mind that when one is being left behind, the others see to it to be able to be of help. It makes the setting more wider and tense. Each character tends to develop in its own pace and succeeds to the main storyline.\nThe art doesn’t have too much depth on it when compared to Death Note. It’s more comical and light. Many panels were sketchy and it concentrated only to the characters rather than the background. The materials being used were detailed and gave more a professional artist feeling. As a reader, I noticed that from the recent updates, the art and story flow seemed bland. Though I may take it as something that an artist wants to practice and improve on, it still confuses the readers and it makes them think on what the artist really wants to portray.\nThe story has a fast progress. It shifts from a weekly and monthly basis then jumping off to a specific awaited date. Such as a release of the early and finals results, getting questionnaires from readers and whatnot. Before you know it, they were already in college. This is a good way for avoiding the readers to get bored rather than reading lengthy chapter page with no thrill in it. Bakuman makes you feel flipping its pages forever. A volume after another, a page after a page. A lot of its chapters weren’t enough for 20 pages, so please expect a lot of cliffhangers.\nBakuman has tediously long dialogues. Lengthy narrations and dialogues from the characters that it sometimes fills up the majority of a panel. For a young reader, they may skip a lot of it since it doesn’t really have nothing to do with the base story. But for someone who is interested in this field, the dialogues are a worth read.\nEven though Bakuman possess a lot of comical scenes, it has a hidden depth on it. Remove the humor, it’s still great. The comedy just adds the shounen flavor to it but is a big factor for those who aren’t into dark themed mangas. Making it more flexible to its readers.\nBakuman drives you to a new world filled with mechanical pencils, T-squares, calligraphy pens, tones and paper. Setting you off in a journey filled not only with the concepts of being a mangaka, but also gives you an idea of their world and what they see behind their eyes of a true manga artist.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="           \n    Bakuman is a manga... about manga. And romance. It tells the story of two teens as they aspire to become mangaka in Weekly Shonen Jump. \n The plot, for the most part, is a very well-written and well-thought-out one. Ohba manages to keep the story interesting, and I really enjoyed observing all the problems that Mashiro and Takagi encountered and how they overcame them. I imagine that the creators of Bakuman had some of the exact same problems that Mashiro amd Takagi did earlier in their career as well. Some of you may disagree with me on this topic and say that the problems were\n          \n        rather unrealistic and unlikely, to which I ask the question: How many of you are professional mangaka? \nCase and point.\n I do have to admit, however, that these people may have somewhat of a point regarding the beginning of the series.  Some of the happenings are very drastic and may seem a bit unrealistic and fast-paced. Yes, the beginning of Bakuman, as well as the end, felt a little rushed, and this makes me wonder if Bakuman would've been that much closer to perfection if the creators had just taken a bit more time in these parts.\nThe characters are a tricky aspect of Bakuman to review. They aren't exactly presented at first as interesting or unique, and some might perceive them as cliché. Since Bakuman is pretty much a one-of-a-kind manga, it's hard to thoroughly and effectively analyze them by comparing them to characters of other manga and/or anime. So I'll look at them as they are as a stand-alone. \n Bakuman's characters are presented in the typical shounen  way. We have Mashiro, the normal kid who gradually gets roped into creating manga. Next we have Takagi, the overachieving student who ropes him in. Then, we have Azuki, Mashiro's girlfriend (chapter one spoiler) and motivation, and we have Miyoshi, Azuki's best friend and later--\n**SPOILER**\n These characters are all very interesting in the way they interact with one another. Mashiro and Azuki's romance, although it seemed like a plot device at times, was very cute, and the rivalry between the mangaka duo and the other artists was simply shounen gold. No characters were neglected, and Ohba did his best to carefully develop each and every one. And need I mention Hiramaru and Yoshida? This is honestly one of the best comedy relief pairs  I've seen in anime.\n The art of Bakuman displays the exact same quality we see in the other aspects. Obata really outdid himself this time, and I dare say I liked Bakuman's art even better than Death Note's. His style stood out very distinctly, his character designs were superb, and I know for a fact that I'm not the only one who loved those faces during the comedy moments 😂👌\n Overall, Bakuman is a masterpiece by my analysis and deserves far more attention that it gets. It's a dramatic, compelling story that leaves you with a great feeling at the end. It's better than Ohba and Obata's past work in that it doesn't completely lose its purpose after certain major plot twists (oh yeah, Death Note fans, you KNOW what I'm talking about). Obata's art is just as good as, if not better than, anything else he's ever made. I can't guarantee that you'll feel the same way towards it that I do, but I can strongly recommend it as one of my favorite manga of all time."},

Bakuman is a candy coated child friendly reality around the world of manga publishing and the like, where the obstacles are only shonen cliches.\nSTORY: What does Bakuman do that is different from any other shonen battle story? The conflicts? No, Bakuman is just like any other shonen fight series, only with pens and ink instead of swords and magic. The Characters? No, there's a variety of quirky characters, but the majority of them can easily be classified as typical archetypes like the\n          \n        rival character, the love interest, or the respected teachers. The plot and theme? Kinda, but only because it was a concept that has yet to be done in the shonen genre.\nBakuman is ultimately just another shonen story. Honestly it's really no different than series like Naruto or Bleach. Ninja=Shinigami=Mangaka, the only true difference is their abilities or what they do in conflicts. Drawing manga to get published in shonen jump=Ninja clashing against each other in hopes of rising their ranks=Fighting evil spirits and training to reach the next level of power, it's all fundamentally similar, but it's not like I'm trying to say there anything wrong with that not at all, Shueisha needs to crank out those stories to remain fresh within it's capital genre to stay on top of their game in the industry (Or make sure One Piece never ends... Not that I'm complaining...).\nBakuman is about romance and the world of manga development, where only one of the characteristics of this manga stays consist and the other is utterly slapped on and awkward. Moritaka Mashiro is the main character, a boy who starts out as an apathetic middle school student, not interested in succeeding in life past the point of being a worker at a deck job who one day leaves his notebook at school. Bothering to get it back because of what it contains, Mashiro returns only to see a follow student had beat him to the punch, only to ask Mashiro if he would to join him as a mangaka duo with the student, Takagi, being the writer and Mashiro being the illustrator.\nOne thing leads to another as the two of them try their best to make it to the top of the Shonen Jump reader polls as the mangaka duo, Ashirogi Muto (With other names as Saiko=Mashiro, and Takagi=Shujin). Naturally, their obstacles include every other manga artist who ever picked up a pencil inducing a vast quantity of quirky characters (From an office worker who turns out to be a manga genius despite never even read an issue of weekly jump to a hyper active sound effect screaming manga artist prodigy), but the stories they come up with are almost interesting enough to want to read them yourself (From Sci fi to comedy, Shujin proves himself to be quite the writer).\nThis is the meat of Bakuman has to offer, watching Saiko and Shujin go from ground zero to serialization several times. It's filled with many reveals of how things work at weekly jump HQ, and incredible amounts of detail is shown what manga artists have to go through just to reach consideration of running a one-shot in a different magazine. This is all interesting, and is very likely what will grab a hold of your attention, but let me step back a bit and go into detail about what I stated earlier, \"One thing leads to another\", is exactly what I want to consider it.\nBakuman is also. for better and mostly worst, a romance story, a painfully dull and unsatisfying one at that. Mashiro isn't just drawing for his own sake, but for his love interest and future plans blocked by only a promise, which is sweet and all but, it's not at all worth caring about. By literally the first chapter (And by that it can't really be classified as a spoiler) the romantic build up is maxed out, Mashiro's love interest, who he confesses to, happens to like him too, awwwwwww.\nHonestly, it's cute, but the deal here is that... That's it. No build up what so ever, it's instant pay off in the first chapter, of a romance series, you know where dates and stuff like that are supposed to take place. Some of you are going to think, well, at least it's no generic love story, it got all that out of the way... That's not any better, it's only makes the romance in the story pathetic, pointless even. Generic harem romances can literally say \"Well at least we aren't like Bakuman!\"\nIt's a deal breaker by chapter one and I'm surprised a lot of people aren't complaining enough about it. Sure Shujin has his majority share of the actual romance, but his just isn't any better... Correction, it is better, but it's just so thrown into the back ground and comes up as if it's simply an annoyance and makes you wonder when will they get back to drawing manga.\nBut outside of that, just as Shujin surprises his peers, I'm actually mildly surprised with Bakuman's sense of humor, every chapter never fails to get a chuckle out of me (Especially the ever work avoiding Hiramaru and his editor, the bits with those two continue to remind me of how humorous and quirky the secondary characters really are).\nBut to get to juicy bits, you got to swallow the bitter stuff with a gain of salt, because Bakuman has it's worth while moments, the manga publishing stuff is very engaging, you'll be waiting with baited breath with Saiko and Shujin for their results of their manga... Over and over again. This is one more strike against Bakuman, the whole ordeal of becoming a popular mangaka is taxing, Bakuman definitely shows that, but this is an ongoing series, and their goal just seems to never reach the leads grasp, and the whole process almost repeats itself step for step while the creators of Bakuman themselves seem to throw several obstacles, from being put on hiatus for medical reasons to some that seem incredibly out of place and plain silly. Slowly revealing that Bakuman isn't a realistic struggle of mangaka, it's about a fortunate guy trying to be the best at whatever the goal is, you will not see any of the manga artists having money problems because their friends at the top of the shonen ladder will lend them support, every mangaka looks out for each other in Bakuman's fantasy world. \nCandy coated is the best term to use here, and the industry isn't child friendly as Bakuman makes it seem (For instance, most manga artist in Japan actually have to draw hentai for a living, I mean go to any of the many doujin fests in Japan and tell me I'm wrong).\nART: As expected from the artist behind Death Note, Bakuman is drawn wonderfully. Though not quite as detailed as his series that pre-dated Bakuman, it is quite still awe inspiring from nicely designed characters to backgrounds with plenty of care to detail.\nHowever, the quality drops about a hundred chapters in, and the overall look of it has grown arguably sloppy and cartoonish then it started out.\nOVERALL:\nThe Good:\n+ Detailed info on whats what about manga publishing is very interesting.\n+ Good Humor, especially from the supporting cast.\nThe Mixed:\n+/- Good artwork / Artworks gets sloppy later on.\nThe Bad:\n- The romance, all of it.\n- Not exactly the reality behind manga making as tries to seem to be. Too shonen and friendly at times.\nHowever, if you're not one to be bothered by the lack of hard facts like I am, Bakuman is still something I'd recommend, it's not fundamentally new at what it's doing, but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining, and that's what really matters in the long run.\n        "},

Even though we have fairly typical leads, it's still fun to watch them  develop and grow closer to their dream. There are also some very eccentric supporting characters who make up for anyone else seeming a bit typical, their rival Nizuma Eiji is an obvious example. Being hailed as a young genius of the manga world, his actions are quite exaggerated, such as the way he makes sound effects while drawing his manga.\n--Enjoyment: 9--\nBakuman is a simple story done in such an exciting way it's hard to overlook.

There is little leeway for Bakuman to cut around the common \"It's a manga about manga\" description, and that's all right - but that doesn't do justice to a Very Good score of 8, does it?\n-Story-\nThe premisis of Bakuman is uncommon at least, and unprecedented at best. Two best friends trying to achieve an unrealistic dream despite the very real cost of losing out to the harsh world of propriety and stability? Cliché start. Any otaku could have seen that coming. But\n          \n        predictability stops there. Encyclopedic mangaka knowledge starts pouring in almost seamlessly with a steadily rising situation of where mediocre talent will not survive. It's complicated: sometimes, even genius and determination doesn't cut it - and life, at least in the Shounen Jump office, goes on with or without you. Bakuman's story makes sure to teach its readers a life lesson of what really goes on behind the ink-splattered nib pen.\n-Art-\nAnyone familiar with Takeshi Obata's illustrations will not be disappointed; that is, Bakuman's art is familiar and unobtrusive. The majority of characters are distinguished properly, and the styles are reasonably consistent, with the minor exception of backgrounds. Understandably, the art is marked as Fair.\n-Character-\nBakuman's characters are memorable. True, characters like Hattori Akira can be classified as static, but rarely are they flat. It can be argued that the majority of the cast do not change; it cannot be argued that the majority are only known for a respectively singular personality trait. The protagonists of Bakuman, Moritaka Mashiro and Akito Takagi, obviously develop in skill and maturity - but never in the usual sense. They face misfortune and successful, and the expected response is sometimes delayed or never made. And that's where the magic happens: Mashiro and Takagi don't do the \"main characters always win\" trope. They can fail, and there are no heroic rematches in Bakuman - lose, grow, and move on, because there's no going back.\n-Enjoyment-\nBakuman was a learning experience for me. I don't regret reading it at all, and I very pleasantly couldn't predict the way the beginning, middle, and end of the series was headed. I was worried, thoughtful, happy, and sad throughout various parts of the manga at a genuine level of emotion. Of course it has bits that dragged a little, and I frankly didn't pay too much attention to the statistics of mangaka \"failures\", but Bakuman is something that taught me something I should have learned long ago when I first flicked through the first few pages of a worn and dusty Japanese piece.\nIt taught me to respect the professional dream hidden within the pages of what we all know as manga.\n        "},

A lot of it was really meta, like a story style being talked about in the manga at the same time as it was being used by the manga.  The artist is the same as Death Note's, and he went less serious for this manga, which is awesome.  Characters make lots of silly expressions, and the visual humour is top notch.\nThe story is very cliche, to the point where I was sneering while I read.  Main character will become\n          \n        a mangaka so he can marry his true love!!  Seeing women as a \"prize\" is old hat and kind of gross, and the female in this particular case doesn't do a lot on her own.  Her entire career choice is done for the man she loves.  It wouldn't have killed the writers to give her something of her own, instead of putting this pretty young girl up on a pedestal to be won.\nThe character's that do focus on their own dreams (ie. mostly men) are very well written, so it's not a total waste of time.  However, the manga banked a lot on the weekly format of Shonen Jump, so it was a little painful for me to read the first half or so of it at once.

Enter Ohba and Obata's second collaboration, following the amazing, and my personal favorite manga ever, Death Note.  Enter Bakuman.\nStory:  The concept's not the most original, I won't lie.  I'm sure plenty of mangaka have toyed with this idea before.  It's not too difficult to think up after all.  Essentially, what it is is two people aspiring to publish a manga.  This is not too interesting in of itself.  However, what makes Bakuman interesting is all the subplots and\n          \n        undertones running through it, driving forward the main plot, moving it to a constant climax.  As the story begins, you get the feeling that the main character, Mashiro, is very, very normal.  There's not too much interesting about him.  But he can draw well.  So well in fact, that he captures the interest of the other main character, Takagi.  Top student in the class, and surprisingly enough, an aspiring mangaka.  So, through a bit of coercion, Takagi gets Mashiro to team up with him to write a manga to be published.  So, the story continues on from here, with tons of supporting characters such as a love interest, an uncle surrounded in tragedy, and a monkey faced editor.  All of these characters, no matter how mysterious they may be, have a back story, and they're all spun together into quite an interesting read.\nArt: The art is rather interesting this time around.  I wasn't really expecting the style Obata decided to use for this manga.  I was very much in love with the character design style he used in Death Note; extremely realistic and charming in a dark sort of way.  This time around though, it all looks very shonen.  This isn't a bad thing, but it takes some getting used to.  It fits the manga's tone relatively well, barring some extremely serious scenes where it really doesn't seem to click well for some reason, but it is still a step down.  I really don't like certain character designs introduced a little deeper into the manga.  On the plus side, Obata's attention to fashion is clear.  He is very clear on what looks good, and knows how to draw clothes that fit the character's persona and make you love them, no matter how the face may look.\nCharacter: The characters in Bakuman are pretty typical.  There hasn't been a character introduced at the time of writing this review (Chapter 16) that can't be stereotyped somehow.  However, because of their backstories, they seem to have a far deeper appeal and reasons to why they are as they are than they really should in all honesty.  As with Death Note, characters in Bakuman grow with time.  Whether these changes are good or bad remain to be seen, but one thing is sure: the changes will be interesting.\nEnjoyment: I honestly really like this series.  No matter what flaws it may have, there really isn't anything that would turn me away from reading the newest chapter as soon as it can be found.  What makes this series great is how deep it runs.  Every time I read a chapter, I feel like there's always more to be told.  There's no dry point in the manga, where life is really dull for these aspiring mangaka, even if they say it is.  xD  \nOverall, I'm very excited as to where this series is going.  An overall rating of 8 may seem a bit low for such a positive review, but I'm still a little hesitant about how this story will go as it progresses.

(Baron Lytton Richelieu)\nPLOT: -\nBakuman can be divided in to two main parts, \"The Dream\" part and \"The Romance\" part. Ohba has blended these two things perfectly to produce a great series. The Dream part focuses on the journey of Mashiro and Takagi as mangaka and their efforts towards achieving their dream [i.e. creating a manga which gets and anime]. The Romance part focuses on Mashiro and Azuki’s relationship.\nOver the years, one unofficial rule has developed i.e. to be on the successful in WSJ, you must do a mainstream manga or something\n          \n        which is beyond exceptional (e.g. Gintama). If Ohba and Obata had just gone for a series which served as a manga tutorial, it might have failed in WSJ but they created a perfect formula which allowed them to create a non-mainstream series having the key shonen ingredients (dreams, friendship, romance, rivalries, hardships etc). Thus creating a series where there’re battles for World Domination, but the weapons aren’t swords but pens and the stage isn’t some fantasy world but the top of manga industry.\nThe general pace and development of plot is quite good though it tends to dip at times and becomes slow and repetitive. The main reason behind is the setting of the plot. As it is a well known example from the industry that there isn’t any fix time for a manga to get an anime adaption (i.e. you can get an anime with your first manga, and you might not get one even after writing dozens of manga). Due to this element, this series can drag for years and can also be wrapped up in a couple of chapters. Hence a consistency is hard thing to maintain.\nCHARACTERS: -\nAs mentioned above, the cast of Bakuman is pretty much Jump like, spirited youths aiming to make it big, strong rivals, cool and mature grownups to guide them, and some who serve the purpose of comic relief. The exception is the lead character Mashiro, who doesn’t appear to be a traditional Jump hero, hence a good change.\nCharacter Development is a strong feature in this series. And you’ll see characters maturing and growing up slowly and steadily. Ohba has planned out his cast really well, hence there are hardly any unnecessary characters and everyone plays his/her role efficiently.\nART: -\nOverall art of this manga is really good and perfect for such a series, something expected from Obata Sensei. Since Bakuman is a manga with heavy content (extra text), it is important to show it in such a manner that readers don’t get a feeling that they are reading a book and hence getting bored. Obata has done a great job in this regard. The panels, dialogue boxes are made in such a way that the reader doesn’t get bored from reading all the explanations and text.\nCONENT:-\nBakuman is among the best manga in terms of the content that is published in it. It is like an encyclopedia on manga especially WSJ. Hence there’re a lot of explanations, references, details and information related to the manga industry (manga in general, magazines etc). All this informative stuff is showed in such a manner that reader enjoys it and doesn’t get bored of it.\nTarget Audience: -\nRegardless of taste in genres and demographics, Bakuman is a series for every manga and anime fan out there.\nTips while reading: -\nSince Bakuman has quite detailed information about manga and manga industry, do try to search for real life examples (such as questioners, character polls, oneshots appearing in WSJ, and news related to the industry) else one can easily forget these details.\n        "},

If you think that then you are disregarding the reality that mangakas live their lives for fantasy so if some of the women seem overly concerned with finding love (3 very small side characters) then it is because fantasy is their world not because the authors don't believe in rounded women. \nI am writing this review mostly to resond to that ridiculous accusation. \nThis manga is amazing! To take a story that is basically only about writing manga and turn it into a battlesque manga that constantly keeps you\n          \n        on your toes takes an author fan and beyond what most are capabale of. Expect no less from the author of Death Note of course. \nThe art is spectacular also. I didn't think the ending scene had the punch it should have but I think that was a calculated descision on the part of the creators who comment on their industry throughout their 10 volume work. \nRead the manga for the art, an unexpected story and most of all for the characters who are HILARIOUS! Particularly EIJI I love him he is just the strangest individual who is sooooo weird and clever. Every scene with him in it has dynamic movement built into it. \nIf you care at all about manga this is a love note to the industry and to the people who enjoy this medium, be they writers, editors, aritists or readers. To be obsessed like every character in this story you have to be a little weird but as most readers will tell you that is a pretty accurate description of us. \nIts a slice of manga life done but two men who have helped define the industry. Not to be missed.\n        "},

However, if you've ever wondered what it's like to break into the manga industry, you won't regret picking this up. The idea of following two burgeoning manga artists as they delve into the realm of serial manga publishing may not sound full of suspense or action, but for me it is. Whenever I finish a volume (I've read 5 now and 6 is on its way), I'm gripped by a desire to immediately begin the next one--or if none is available, reread the volume I just finished.\nThe fact Shujin and Saiko want to be manga artists before they graduate\n          \n        high school adds pressure and suspense to their endeavors, Eiji acts as an arch-nemesis/teacher figure as well as comic relief due to his eccentricities, and Saiko's strained relationship with Miho is far from the typical \"leading character romance.\" There's always something to stress over every step of the way.\nI find the pace to be slow, but I enjoy that. It gives the authors time to flesh out the characters much more and keeps me interested in their situation even when Shujin, and Saiko are waiting around for a call from their editor for the 20th time. It's not just the views into the workings of the publishing company Shueisha or the rivalry between all the other budding artists that keeps me so excited to read more, it's the fact that I feel for each character every time something happens to them. This is an overall excellent manga, and I hope people who aren't hardcore fans at least give this series a chance as well.\n        "},

That aside, there are parts it does extend a little too long but otherwise good all round. The romance aspect of the story, between Mashiro and Azuki, is interesting but a little annoying at the same time - who doesn't want to see the person they love? \nArt:\n          \n        Very good, I expected nothing less. The art differs depending on the scene types and it was also enjoyable to see the difference in styles of the series that the characters have drawn, from our main duo to the rivals and friends that are introduced along the way. \nCharacter: I like the characters, I think many of them are well developed, all though others could use some work. Some of the minor characters could use a little work but I find the majority of them have realistic personalities, except for Iwase who in my opinion seems a little off. Proud, intelligent women don't need the justification of a man, which is what she seems to be trying to gain, so I find that a little unusual. \nEnjoyment: I found it very enjoyable, the story line, though it does follow along some predictable lines at points, does pull it off in a unique way and I was drawn in from the first few chapters. A bit wordy in places, with quite a lot of banter about ideas, but it is well thought out and presented.  \nOverall: I recommend Bakuman to anyone who wants to immerse themselves in something interesting and well drawn :) \n        "},

Their main goal is to get one of their mangas into an anime.\nYou could call this a fast summary of the story.

The art in Bakuman is really really good, the way they have the pages and chapters layed out is also\n          \n        making some of the way the art looks in this Manga.

The artist of Bakuman Takeshi Obata states that he was nervous about the series because of the lack of fantasy. Even\n          \n        though it lacks the fantastical craziness associated with much of today’s Manga it has various intertextual references to many other Manga series which seems to be a genius device which hooks the reader and reels them in almost instantly.

Beign honest I was really amazed that both stories (Bakuman and Death Note) aren't alike. So if you didn't like Death Note you can give a chance to it.\nThe story is about Saiko, a middle school student that decided to write manga and Mashiro a classmate of him , that accepted to draw for him after the promise he made with Azuki(the girl he's\n          \n        in love with). Mashiro's supposed to make a manga that will turn in an anime and she has to play the role of the heroine. With this the whole story starts... I really like the way how the things develope, because new characters start appering all the time,some love dramas are set up and new rivals that are funny and amazing ,but the most  I liked was that while you're reading you learn how a manga it's create and how difficult and tiring it's making one and thanks to that I can appreciate even more the work of the mangakas.\nThe art it's not really amazing, but I think it fits the story, I mean Bakuman it's a comedy and with this art, each scene it's even more amusing. I can say that I was laughing quite a lot all the time, so I think that choosing this art was really good.\nWith this story Tsugumi Ohba shows us that  is a great author because is able to do differents kind of stories and really interesting ones.\n        "},

The reason it is so amazing, is because it narrows down to 2 genres. A beautiful compelling story about love, compassion, goals, dreams, and an in depth look at the creation of Manga at Shonen Jump in Japan. \nThe story follows Moritaka Mashiro, a kid who has his life all planned out- become a white collar worker, and not do anything interesting. His depression and denial comes from the death of his beloved uncle, Nobuhiro Mashiro (Pen name: Kawaguchi\n          \n        Taro). His uncle was a one hit wonder manga artist who- in effort to get another series, worked too hard, which ultimately lead to his death when Mashiro was little. Mashiro would always go to his studio and watch him work. Mashiro, now a freshman, is approached by Akito Takagi, a aspiring writer, and manga otaku, asking him to create a manga with him. With Takagi writing it, and Mashiro drawing. Eventually, they find out Mashiro's long-time crush, Miho Azuki, is trying to become a voice actress. Mashiro confesses his love to her, and they make a promise. Merry each other when both their dreams come true. \nI have only read 17/20 volumes, because i prefer to read the actual prints by Viz instead of the scans. But, in my time of wait each month for each new volume to be released, i have read my favorite volumes again and again because i cannot give enough. Bakuman has rivals, drama, grudges, failures, accomplishments, and in my opinion, one of the the greatest stories ever written.

( aannnddd transition onto next point w/o giving anything else away)\n    for characters, i was on the fence whether that should deserve a 9 or an 8. i feel like there are too many characters and some being somewhat unnecessarily and detracting, there was not enough time to fully develop all the characters nor would i feel the readers, myself included, would really care if some were never in the picture to begin with. many of the side characters who are important throughout the manga became ghost characters towards the end, only appearing briefly as to remind readers that they exist, this goes for much of team Fukuda. \nnonetheless i thoroughly enjoyed this manga with little room for complaints, any complaints i have being minuscule.\n        "},

The characters all with have one thing or another that will make you love or hate about them, their unique personalities are one the best part of this series.One bad thing i may said about this series is the speech, in where there is a lot of sentences in every chapter, but rest assure this one of the good aspect the creators of this story have, like many of his other works and the story is so good that most people don't mine this part it, in fact it will make wanna read more every time a chapter ends.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="          \n    its a manga about manga. Inception jokes aside, let me explain whats so good about it. Once again, the Obata/Ohba team have have gone against the norm in Weekly Shonen Jump, like they did previously with Death Note. Bakuman is a drama and slice of life, no battles or evil editors or anything, and it is amazing. It starts out where two 14 year old boys decide to make a manga together, with one drawing and the other writing, and it follows them over the years breaking into and working as mangakas in weekly shonen jump. There are a wide cast of characters, including editors\n          \n        and other mangakas in Weekly Shonen Jump. These editors and mangakas are all heavily inspired or outright fictionalized version of real life editors and mangakas in Weekly Shonen Jump. There is a large romantic subplot which, while one of the main points of the story, is still secondary to the life of a mangaka. One of the most prominent things I noticed when reading it was how realistic it was. It is very realistic to the point of almost seeming cynical, and a recurring theme seems to be Dreams and Idealism vs Reality. A common scenario will be one character expressing his dreams and optimistic ideals and another character shutting him down, explaining how it realistically works, which the idealistic character would reluctantly accept. Another recurring theme, or arguably the main theme, was how difficult being a mangaka is. A recurring symbolic motif in the series, since the very beginning, was the ending of Ashita no Joe which, Spoiler alert, ended with Joe dying in the ring, a smile on his face and becoming \"pure white ash\", which symbolizes dying while doing what you love, among other things. this perfectly portrays how hard it is to be a mangaka due to the amount of physical risk it puts on your body.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="          \n    Bakuman is a shonen series which articulately redefines the genre of shonen manga. It is a unification of several meaningful ideologies that taught me the following things:\n-	 Nobody achieves great work with little efforts. Even the gifted ones slog through blood and sweat to get to where they are today.\n-	Work hard in silence and let success make the noise.\n-	Everyone needs a friend who is brutally honest, even if the truth may hurt.\n-	Your loudest competitors are your greatest source of learning. \nStoryline:\nFollowing the adventures of two protagonists towards achieving their dream of being successful mangakas, the manga provides insightful information about the process of manga making\n          \n        without boring you to every detail. From the conceptualization of an idea to the actual implementation of the works, the story provides perceptive information on the process of manga making. \nThanks to Bakuman, I am now able to better appreciate the efforts behind every manga and anime I watched. \nThe flow of the story is appropriately set out, with 20 volumes spanning a story of over 10 years. It is very unlike your typical shonen manga where a day spent by the characters can span over several volumes.  Pages are often filled with details and extensive dialogues, which gives readers a lot to digest.  Hence, if you are looking a Bleach / Naruto / One Piece equivalent, then Bakuman is definitely not for you, since it  is very story based and less expressive in terms of graphics.\n\nCharacters:\nThe interaction among the characters are kept at a practical, sense making level, with them straying between the lines of competitors and friends. The character development is gradual and it is only towards the end when you back-tracked to the much earlier volumes that one would realise how much they have grown.\nHowever, I personally do not feel a personal sense of attachment to the characters and the only one that attracted me and cracked me up is Niizuma Eiji, the prodigy who happens to be portrayed as the main good-natured antagonist.\nArt:\nThe art, though clean and easily discernable, is somewhat lacking in terms of expression. Due to the intensive blurbs of dialogues, it appears like more attention was paid to the words than the drawings. However, for an unusual manga which is substantially story-based with lesser focus on the graphics, I do not see this as a major problem. \n\nOverall, Bakuman is not a manga which will keep you at the edge of your seat. It is something that takes time to digest and better read in a slower, leisurely pace. "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="          \n    Hello once again. My last review was a fun and a quite relaxed review of lucky star but now...imma step up and review a more serious manga...bakuman. But before we start i dont want you to confuse this master piece with the \"bakumon' where they throw around coloured balls that turn into beasts..hehe\n\n                 GENERAL REVIEW \n  Bakuman had a great story unique from others because they were in a manga about making manga (i assure you after you read this you too will be a pro editor). The starting was a bit slow but it slowly built upon its flaws and added romance, action and a hint of rivalry between comrads.\n\n                                  GENERAL CHARACTER\n  bakuman desplayed its own sense of character and stood out among all other animes withen the slice of life genre. Not only did it hook me but it also brought knew things into the story that kept me on the edge of my seat. overall it had great charcter and i expected nothingless from the creators of deathnote\n                                 DISLIKES\n  The plot twists and the opening could be considered...weak and the charcters began to become less and less appealing -mentally-.\n  I also think that the artist should have picked a better style to fit the story instead of going with his trade mark style, just because it worked in deathnote.\n                               ART\n  The art was nice and refreshingly different compared to most of the extremely cute or 'sexy' style. Of course it had great line work and facial expressions but i still personally think it wasnt \"anime\" enough for this genre and writing type.\n                              FINALIZATION\n  I enjoyed this manga completely and only had a few petty problems with the plot and art. so for its final grade i will give it a -drum roll please-\n8\n\n\n"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="           \n    Bakuman, huh?\nWell, I first heard of Bakuman through a friend who recommended me, the first two or three volums were good...but nothing more, the good stuff began in the volum 4, that was when I began to be trapped in the story.\nI'll resume all my points of view in one phrase:\nThe Story is excelent (since volum 4) and the end is a big crap. \nThat's all, read it, you'll enjoy it for sure, it have very good characters (such as Niizuma Eiji) but those autors don't know how to end a manga. That's all, and it's because the end  that i give it a\n          \n        8, if the end were other i would give it a 9 for sure, because, you know, it's a manga of 9. Except for the ending.\nGreetings.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="           \n    Bakuman: What better theme to center a manga around then....manga? This idea may seem ludicrous at first (and for the life of me, I have no idea how Tsugumi Ohba sold this idea) but it works. It works well, to say the least. Without further ado, let's delve into the story:\nThe story is centered around Mashiro Mortitaka, nephew of a late gag manga artist who committed suicide. During school, Mashiro passes the time using his artistic skill to admire Azuki Miho. One day, he realizes he's leaves his notebook at school. When he goes to retrieve it, it's there that he comes face-to-face with Takagi\n          \n        Akito, a quiet boy who sits in the back of the class. Takagi, who has seen Mashiro's sketches of Miho, hands the notebook back to Mashiro while hinting at the reciprocity of his feelings. Just before Mashiro can take the notebook, Takagi offers an intresting proposal: \"I want you to write a manga with me\". And so the story of love, ambition, and - manga - begins.\nThe meaning title \"Bakuman\" has never really been announced, but many devoted fans believe it to mean fighting (baku) manga (man for short). Bakuman is a story about love, passion, and ambition, which can seem blind at times, but beautiful at others. Bakuman may be a story but also gives the reader many insights on the world of a mangaka and just how difficult and stressful it can be. This manga is classified as a shounen genre, and I suppose it should be. Instead of monsters, characters fight against deadlines. In the place of training, they search for new ideas. There are heros, and there are villans, which is an incredible feat for a story like this, although I'd expect nothing less from the author of Death Note (yes, both are his works). The story is smart, brash, brave, heartwarming and deserving of a genre of its own.\nThe art, if you've read Death Note, starts out with almost the same style (as the artist is the same). Backgrounds are dark and lines are a bit thick, and each panel retains the same dark mood until you get a few chapters in, where it makes a transition. The art becomes more casual and character expressions are lighter, almost comical. Overall though, the art is amazing (the first line of this paragraph should've explained that). The artist himself, Takeshi Obata, is an extremely experienced artist who has worked on many works. \nThe character development is great, but is slightly slow to start with. Characters remain static after introduction, especially at the start of the story. From there, you learn about every character. Each character and mangaka's personalities are polished until they shine. As previously stated, a huge theme in this book is about ambition and resolve. The question that is often given to the reader is whether or not a character will stick to their ideals and their resolve. This, of course, is not always true, and sometimes you see characters that change for the better, and some for the worse. But don't misunderstand. This is a shounen manga. And the battle that is waged is not only physical, but emotional too. There's a fight in each character that is a true joy to watch and cheer on.\nOverall, this manga is absolutely wonderful, despite what some may call a short ending (although I believe that the ending was as long as it needed to be to serve the purpose of the story). I truly enjoyed reading this manga, and anyone who has an interest in simply learning a bit more about the medium you love, or simply searching for a great story should not hesitate to pick it up.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="          \n    What to say about Bakuman by, Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata? Other than what the reader already knows, is that it is about two boys aspiring to become manga-kas or otherwise known as manga creators. My favorite characters are Eiji Nizuma, Shinta Fukuda, the dead uncle of Moritaka and Kazuya Hiramaru. I felt that although the artwork, as always, is superb and never dropping quality as the books go on (seldom some mangas do drop in quality, could name a few too but that was not point of review..) so I have no complaints there. I felt the story was mediocre but was kind enough\n          \n        to boost it to fair, due to the fact that anyone with a lot of experience in the manga world could come up with the story. Not the most original of stories, but it was never dry and had some good points here and there, so I can not diss the work too much. The characters were all original, and added dynamics to the story (if it was not for some characters, I might of stopped reading awhile back unless the superb art persuades me otherwise).  I enjoyed it immensely, but when I got bored of it, I swapped to a different series until I had forgotten what I had read. Plus, the added storyboards made it feel like you were an editor or supervisor, overseeing the work.\nOverall, I think it is a good series for passing time but I do not think that you should read it, all in one go. But I reccommend the series, for those who are interested in the creators of Death note, and for those who are interested in becoming manga artists themselves. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="           \n    From the creators of the infamous \"Death Note\" comes another work from the fame duo (Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata). Now the name \"Bakuman\" may be forgettable or be sometimes misheard as the now famous anime \"Bakugan\" but the difference is really out there. The story revolves around two teenage boys Mashiro Moritaka, and Takagi Akito and the wondrous world of manga. Well its not that spectacular but this manga will change your mind. The world of manga is very difficult and rewarding as the story shows the ups and downs of becoming a mangaka. \nThe reason I like Bakuman is because its different from\n          \n        many shonen mangas out there and from the famous Weekly Shonen Jump magazine it really stood out to me. The story became interesting as the story introduces various different artist and their different types of manga. \nThe other reason why I like this manga was the fact that the creators thought of different mangas inside the story and made it sound so awesome.\nThe different mangas inside the story are memorable as you hear the titles over and over again and they become stuck in your mind. \nI highly recommend this title if you want a break from the fighting and nonsense of other shonen magazines as you will learn to appreciate how manga really works in Japan.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="          \n    I avoided Bakuman for the longest time. A creative work about creatives struggling to succeed in the very medium they’re portrayed in just seems…masturbatory. However, I recently gave the series a chance and was quite surprised with it. The story is simple: Classmates Mashiro and Takagi decide to pursue their dream of becoming professional mangaka together, ultimately aiming at having their work adapted into an anime. Set over ten years, the themes are more about growing up than necessarily coming of age. Mashiro and Takagi set out after a dream and have to come to grips with the fact that it’s not a singular thing,\n          \n        but an accumulation of smaller victories.\nThe series features tons of interesting characters, fantastic artwork, and a story that follows a definite shonen pattern (work hard, persevere, overcome obstacle, repeat). There are a few drawbacks though. While a good number of the characters are interesting, the sheer number of them means a fair few aren’t fully rounded out. I think one of the illustrated popularity polls showed someone ranked at 41st, which should give you some idea. One character’s neglect in particular bothered me because they were fairly central to the plot and didn’t really see much love until the end of the series. Besides that, the only other negative was that the pacing seemed really uneven.\nOn to the good stuff. If forced, I’d label Bakuman a slice-of-life dramedy; however, Bakuman isn’t a series easily confined to one genre. There are times when it acts like a romance, times when the pacing and art resemble a battle series, and still other times when there are some serious mystery elements. This flexibility of the story and art is perfect because it allows them to show and comment on a wide range of manga, which is what you want in a manga about the business of manga production.\nThe aspect about the business and creation of manga turned out to be the biggest draw. If the story was getting a little slow, there was still always the promise of some insight of how to construct a serialized story or how the editorial side works. The fact that Obata and Ohba teach about various aspects of the business of creating while still telling a compelling story, without seeming to lecture, is incredible.\nOverall, this is a very good series that should have a little something for everyone in it. I would definitely recommend, particularly for creative types that like to tell stories in any form."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="           \n    There is something quite charming about Bakuman,  I first picked up Bakuman vol. 1 at my local Library and after realizing that Bakuman was made by the same two people as Deathnote I had to have more.\nBakuman will reveal ton of information about the Manga industry and with a great story and awesome humor you might end up getting all 20 novels.\nBakuman reveals how Manga is created. From storyboards to rough drafts, presenting, publishing and animating.\nIf you ever wondered how Manga like Naruto, Deathnote, Inuyasha, or King of Tennis was made then give Bakuman a whirl.\nBakuman's reading time is about 3 to four hours\n          \n        a book for me which is much longer that books like Naruto.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="          \n    \"People who have a dream and are striving toward it... People who are searching for a dream... I want to support those people.\" - Miho Azuki\nIs there a dream you want to achieve? That dream can only come true with a lot of hard work, but if you keep at it, the payoff will, indeed, be great. I'm sure that's the message that Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata, the ones behind \"Death Note\", wanted to convey in this manga. From the moment I heard about this manga, I knew I had to read it and watch its anime adaptation. After getting a box-set of the\n          \n        entire manga series sometime after completing the anime, I began to seriously read the manga, and I've got to say, I enjoyed it just as much as the anime.\nLadies and gentlemen, aspiring mangaka of all ages, here is my review of \"Bakuman.\"\nMoritaka Mashiro is a middle school boy who basically doesn't know what to do with his life. He used to want to be a mangaka, but he gave up on that dream after the death of his uncle, who was a mangaka. However, one day, he accidentally leaves his notebook at school, and when he goes back to get it, Akito Takagi, his genius classmate, is waiting for him. Takagi has seen Mashiro's drawing of his crush, Miho Azuki (who we later find out dreams of becoming a voice actress), and asks him to team up with him to create manga. Mashiro refuses at first, but when Miho finds out about it, it ends up leading to a promise that once one of Mashiro and Takagi's manga gets an anime adaptation, Miho will voice the heroine; then, Mashiro and Miho will get married. (They agree not to actually see each other until then, though.) The story of \"Bakuman.\" follows Mashiro and Takagi as they strive to create manga, meeting friends and rivals along the way.\nI guess I should start with the artwork. Now, the artwork for this manga, drawn by Takeshi Obata, is rather good. Some of the character designs reminded me of characters in \"Death Note\"....but hey, they're from the same mangaka duo! What do you expect me to say?! Speaking of the characters, there is a great number of likable characters in this manga, and all of them get great development. I especially liked Shinta Fukuda and Eiji Niizuma; both of them had some really funny moments.\nNow, let's talk about the story. I can think of a few other manga that have a mangaka as one of the main characters, if not THE main character (Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to, etc). However, what I love about the story in THIS manga is how it portrays a story like this. Not only does it give us a more realistic look at the manga industry (heck, I sometimes even wondered if it was secretly Ohba-sensei and Obata-sensei's autobiography), but it's a kind of story that inspires you to chase after whatever dream you have. Seeing Mashiro, Takagi, and all of the other mangaka who appear in this series doing (or drawing, I should say) what they love.... it just really gets you motivated, you know?\nOverall, Bakuman is a pretty good manga. If you're looking for a realistic and/or an inspiring read, this is the one. Whether or not you end up liking it.... well, I guess that determines whether or not Ohba-sensei and Obata-sensei succeeded in their gamble.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="               \n    Bakuman, a pumping, realistic series of chasing your dreams and self determination. This is truly one of my favorite manga series BY FAR. I would even go as far as to say I like this more than I like death note, mostly because of how relatable this series is to me personally. I myself being a 15 year old who loves to write stories, and hope to become a proffesional mangaka with by best friend leo (which we actually planned to do before this series came out) so this series is extreamly relatable. The author does a spectacular job of potraying the daily struggles of\n          \n        the people who created the works that have gotten us all through some hard times. But what really makes this series is the characters! The characters in this series are like a rainbow of different personalities and characteristics. From the love struck Mashiro to the lazy Himura. I also loved all the references to manga and Weekly jump (such as when takagi was listing off jump manga with swords in them). There are also some characters that remind me of Weekly jump mangaka. An example of this would be Enji Nizuma, who is an extream otaku and a workaholic, which is very similar to Eiichiro Oda, the author of One Piece. Another example is Himura who I consider to be Yoshihiro Togashi. Think about it, they both are kinda lazy, have had two hit series, and have married a fellow mangaka. Overall this series is a fantastic tale of the struggles of manga artists and their passion for manga, a series that i consider to be a must read!\n        "},
