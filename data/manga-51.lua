    Slam Dunk is probably the best manga ever published and the anime version is one of the best I have ever seen. Even though the series has ended more than a decade ago, many people  wiill wholeheartedly agree that this franchise has stood the test of time. \
The story is simple but the execution is incredible, each chapter is filled with humor, action, drama, comedy and a whole lot more. The anime series was good and worthy of being considered a landmark anime, but if you have yet to see the anime then you don't know what you're missing. However there are things that\
          \
        are not shown in the anime series which is why it is crucial for you to read this manga. The interhigh games are a blast!\
Takehiko Inoue certainly knew how to end the series with a bang! The last game is so good, every character is at their best and certainly no other title can rile up the readers emotions like this, it really feels like your watching the NBA finals.\
The artwork is simply great even though there are a lot of better looking manga out there, the decade old graphics still manages to go toe to toe with other more recent titles out there.\
The characters of this title are by far the most fully developed in any title out in the market and I'm not just talking about the main characters, I'm also talking about the supporting cast even those belonging to rival teams. The character development is so good that it is difficult to choose one character as a favorite. Each character has a well told background even those who appear in just a few chapters have a very detailed and well executed background story. You'll probably remember the names of not only the Shohoku players but also the names of their rivals, most notably 'Sendoh'.\
Overall Slam Dunk is one of the best Manga ever made and I'm sure that once you read it, you will agree with me. I guarantee that you won't be able to resist finishing the manga in a few days if not a few hours because it is that damn good. If you think the anime was great, try reading the manga and I'm sure you'll feel that the anime series could have been better, the interhigh games are one hell of a joyride!",

    Before I start, I must point something out. If you're expecting something like Kuroko no Basket with Zone, 100% accuracy shooting, perfect copy and other supernatural powers, stop reading right now, because it has none of that. Also, SD focuses more on the whole team, rather than just 2 characters (Kuroko and Kagami). Now, onto the recommendation.\
The story follows Sakuragi Hanamichi, a delinquent who is in love with a girl named Haruko and wants to impress her in some way, so he decides to join the basketball club. That was his initial reason for joining, but he gradually develops a love for the sport and\
          \
        starts working harder than anyone else. Starting off from the very basics like dribbling, lay ups and defense, slowly gaining experience, you can see him improving with every match that passes.\
The art looks rather simple at first, but improves after some time. The matches in particular, are really well drawn. Shots, dunks, passes, player movements - everything is drawn in a way you'd understand what's going on. \
The characters is probably the strongest point of this manga. Sakuragi is one of the most well-developed main characters I've seen in all of manga/anime. The same can be said for the rest of Shohoku's team members. Heck even the rival teams are so well-developed, you would have a problem chosing who to cheer for. My favourite non-Shohoku character is Ryonan's ace - Sendoh. He is such an amusing and fun character that you just can't help but love.\
As a sport manga, it's really beginner friendly. Even if you don't know much about basketball, this manga will teach you everything about the sport. From the basics like how to dribble, how to shoot a ball correctly, passing, to advanced skills like how to grab a rebound successfully, how to screen-out and set up screens, how to avoid the different kinds of fouls (double dribble, travelling, pushing and so on) and to use fouls to your advantage. Speaking of fouls, there are a lot of them in this manga, unlike in Kuroko no Basket where there was barely any contact between the players. If you get 5 fouls, you leave the game. Fouls bring more tension into the matches (which are already intense enough) and makes them more enjoyable. When the players are tired, they are tired. What I mean by that is that their movements slow down, shooting percentage goes down and the players become more vulnerable to mistakes. This is what realism is.\
I also have to mention the final game (don't worry, I'm not gonna spoil it). This manga probably has the best final game ever. It hit all the right points and it was so damny emotional. I was barely holding my tears in the last 4-5 chapters of the last game and I doubt any other sports manga can make me even tear up like this.\
Slam Dunk is the closest thing you'll get to a realistic basketball series. I also have to mention the humor. The humor in this manga is pure gold. I dare say it's near Gintama's humor level. It also references some things from real life, mostly from NBA. That is something rarely seen among anime/manga.\
Highly recommended for fans of: Hajime no Ippo (it's like its basketball equivalent), Kuroko no Basket (I love Kuroko, but KnB fans must feel the greatness of this manga), Haikyuu and sport fans as a whole.\
I also recommend this manga to people who want to get into basketball. This one will surely help you with your basketball studies. \

    Slam Dunk is the most popular and iconic basketball manga around, thanks to a dynamite main character and Takehiko Inoue's clear passion for the sport. \
Hanamichi Sakuragi, a red-headed delinquent and complete basketball neophyte, is the heart and soul of Slam Dunk. He's great at various things (beating up other delinquents, being tall, and being rejected by girls are chiefs among them), and while playing basketball is clearly not one of them, don't tell him that; in fact, Sakuragi's brand of unreasonable confidence and swaggery is a breath of fresh air in a genre usually populated by bland genius or meek underdogs as main protagonists.\
          \
        He's a very easy character to root for, and it's delightful to watch him slowly transform from playing just to impress a girl into being genuinely affected by all the feelings that the game entailed. Whether it's his one-sided rivalry with the prodigious Rukawa, his constant goofs in the court, or his endearing simple-mindedness, Sakuragi will make you laugh and face-palm until eventually he'll also make you fist-pump in pride as he successfully defended a dangerous opponent, secured a key rebound, ,nailed his first jump shoot, and many more.  \
This might seems like an unnecessarily obvious statement, but there's really a lot of basketball in Slam Dunk. It's drawn at a very deliberate pace; Inoue likes to take his time, often going over two or three volumes to depict a single match (for the final match, he went all-out and spread the match through 6+ volumes). Although there's a significant amount of humor, rom-com triangle, and off-court basketball events in the initial volumes, once the main cast is assembled it's pretty much Basketball Action all the time. Non-playing characters like Sakuragi's love interest Haruko and his amusing band of delinquent pals are inevitably demoted into the role of spectators, and character development is practically confined in the realm of basketball court as the main cast (especially, but not limited to, Sakuragi) learned to utilize/expand their strengths, overcome their weaknesses, and develop chemistry with each other. It's safe to say that if you enjoy the entirety of Slam Dunk, you're already a big fan of basketball or on your way into becoming one. \
Inoue's art is a big part of what makes the matches, slow as they are, so enjoyable. You'd be hard-pressed to find more passionate depiction of a basketball game on manga pages; whether it's rim-shattering dunks, ferocious blocks, or gorgeous three-point swishes, there's a range of dramatic moments native to the sport that he successfully captured. It gets increasingly beautiful and detailed, too. Homages to the 1990s NBA are abound, from the players themselves (Sakuragi and team captain Akagi, for example, were clearly modeled after Dennis Rodman and Patrick Ewing respectively), some iconic poses, and jersey color schemes. There's also a sense of real-life plausibility within the games, as the players in Slam Dunk thrived with realistic skills and athleticism rather than over-the-top superhuman traits. Questionable tactical moments do exist (quad-teaming a single player, anyone?), but in terms of the general flow of the game,it's still a lot more faithful than your typical sports manga. \
Slam Dunk ends rather abruptly, covering only a single tournament season, and some potential future opponents/match-ups being teased ultimately never materialized. It could've become a long-running epic a la Hajime no Ippo, but apparently Inoue had other plans. Even then, it's still a powerful and memorable journey, led by a beloved red-headed brat. \

    If you're a regular basketball watcher, or a solid fan of the sport, then Slam Dunk is a must watch for you. This piece of work is skillfully written by the famous author Inoue Takehiko, also known for his other works such as REAL and Vagabond. Slam Dunk also had outstanding sales in Japan and a successful adaptation series (along with four movies) which were sold worldwide, thus inspiring young people to practise basketball passionately.\
As said above, Slam Dunk is for those who are into basketball. Inoue Takehiko himself has been a basketball player in his high school days, and he is an active NBA\
          \
        watcher, so you don't have to worry about technical mistakes or poorly developed games, 'cause Takehiko truly knows how to write a basketball game and illustrate it, also adding as many intensity as possible, to make a thrilling and memorable game. (There are a few matches involving such great writing). Reason why I mentioned this is, this is the basic feature a basketball series should contain, to attract readers/watchers.\
The characters are Slam Dunk's strongest point. A meaningful quote (from a review) by Inoue Takehiko is: \"I don't force my characters to do things their personality doesn't allow, even if it means to progress the story\". I wholeheartdly agree with this saying, and this is possibly why Takehiko's characters have been a successs. \
Now let's focus on the actual story and characters of Slam Dunk. The main character of the series, which invests more time in him is Sakuragi Hanamichi. In the beginning, Sakuragi is a punk and delinquent who socializes with others of his kind and make troubles. He gets into fighting a lot and a notable characteristic of his, he gets rejected by every female he's confessed to. Heartbroken, Hanamichi stumbles upon Haruko Akagi, a pretty girl, who makes Sakuragi fall in love with her real quick. Due to her being the sister of the basketball club's captain, Hanamichi ended up in the basketball team and that's when his journey as a baskettoman (Hanamichi's pronunciation of basketball player). Simply put, Hanamichi starts a complete beginner, starting from the scratch, such as dribbling the ball, doing lay ups and rebounding. (Also to note that Slam Dunk explains almost every important and basic rule of basketball, via DR.T, a short and amusing tertiary character who has enough knowledge in basketball). And this said, Inoue Takehiko brilliantly develops Hanamichi's gradual growing love for basketball. \
The Shohoku team's members are all nicely developed. Starting from Akagi, a tough, gorilla looking young boy who is the captain of the Shohoku basketball tean. Akagi has an unbeatable spirit for the sport of the basketball. This very spirit drives along the team in high morale which is very helpful and basically the core of their accoplishments. His relationship with Sakuragi Hanamichi is also one of the best things in the show, they have a cat and mouse relationship in the beginning which develops into a long term friendship. Next, we have the megane kun, which is the essential characteristic to every sports series. A megane kun who is loyal to the team and boosts their morale in times of trouble. Kogure is the vice captain of the Shohoku team and the helping hand of Akagi. They both have known each other since childhood and have a trusting friendship between each other. \
Rukawa Kaede is the everlasting rival of Sakuragi Hanamichi. Rukawa is always one step ahead of Hanamichi, which irritates him the most and motivates him to actively practice basketball and get better at it. At first, Rukawa gives an impression of a popular, quiet, good looking guy who excels at what he does. And he really does excel at basketball. Though slow (very slow), his relationship wih Hanamichi gives fruits. (Not going to spoil). Also necessary to say, Hanamichi also considers Rukawa a rival in love. Unfortunately for Hanamichi, Haruko is all over and drools over Rukawa, not that the latter cares anyway. \
Lastly, the trouble makers of the Shohoku. Ryota Miyagi and Mitsui Hisashi. Both have been delinquents and have had constant conflicts with each other. Due to a fight, Ryota is sent to hospital, resulting in a long break in bball.Ryota's quite short, and this makes him a key player for Shohoku. He excels at dribbling the basketball and giving no look passes, cause he knows where his teammates are in the court. He also shoots two pointers at times and has an unmatched speed which comes to hand Shohoku plenty of times. On the other hand, Mitsui Hisashi took a different path from Ryota. He decided to stop playing basketball (reasons stated in his arc, which it's pretty spoiler heavy), but he eventually comes back at the team after an exhaustingly long mini arc (in the anime, mostly). \
Though those were the main characters, which are awesomely developed, Slam Dunk also focuses on the \"opponents\" of Shohoku. Aces such as Sendo Akira, Shinichi Maki, Kenji Fujima, Eiji Sawakita are all equally developed and sometimes you root for their team to win. \
The distinct art of Inoue Takehiko is also enjoyable to watch and read. Slam Dunk actually is one of his first drawn series, and it's a very good chance to watch Inoue Takehiko develop as an artist. \
Overall Slam Dunk is located at the 2nd place (of sports series). It was an undescribable ride with lots of fun, funny and sad moments. It clearly deserves a 10 in my book, as these kind of series are very rare.\

    Everything about this was jus incredible, it was one smooth hilarious touching ride, one after the other.\
Art: each character looks unique, can recognize each of them quickly (unlike some mangas where characters jus get a hair-style change and they call it another character). Gets better and better, quite realistic drawings compared with other mangas. The people look pretty real and the guys look damn cool when they're supposed to be. The girls are pretty cute too. \

    Slam Dunk is a great manga. When I first got into Slam Dunk I thought it was gonna suck mainly because I'm not much of a basketball fun and lost alot of interest in the beginning so I ended up dropping it. When I finished reading Hajime No Ippo I went back to this manga and fell in love with it, the story for Slam Dunk is phenomenal and the characters are impossible not to like especially the tensai xP. Though Slam Dunk is a great manga you will be disappointed, because you will not want this series to end.\

    The skills are pretty realistic, at least from a non player point of view.\
Unlike some manga which the main character always win the fight, or manage to gain some realistically impossible secret moves (read: kuroko no basket), or even a super jutsu that is applicable to every situation (read: naruto & bleach), this develops the character real. They face ups & downs. They need to train to get better.\

    \" Gold medals aren't really made of gold. They're made of sweat, determination, and a hard-to-find alloy called guts \"\
Does this quote describes what this manga is about? Probably not, but I felt that it would be cool writing it before I start review. This is already 24 years old, it started back in 1990 and was publishing to 1996 (six years)\
Back then, basketball wasn't that popular in Japan, very few really talked about it, but mangaka Takehiko Inoue liked basketball, and even though he was told by his editor that basketball is almost a taboo in Japan, he decided to write manga about it,\
          \
        mostly because of his love for the same sport. Takehiko Inoue understands what sport is about, he understands the value of friends and basketball, and he puts that in this amazing art work \
Hanamichi Sakuragi is teenager that just started high school, and he doesn't have any luck with girls. He was rejected 50 times in middle school, and his friends always make fun of him because of that, telling him that he is \"breaking records\" . He stumbles upon a beautiful girl named Haruko Akagi that asked him if he does like basketball - because he was tall, standing 6''2' . He immediately says yes, altough he doesn't know anything about it, and there is the the so called \"plot\" . The guy picks up basket to get attention from the girl she likes, and that's the simple story, but simple can sometimes turn out to be best.\
\
Many sport, shonen manga tend to have great characters, the case is same with SD. Maybe the best thing about this work are characters. They are vivid, have their own personalities and you can relate to many of them. It's not just that they are vivid, but after reading few chapters you imagine them as real persons, like they truly exist, they're alive and are making a story by themselves. They are filled with joy and freshness, comedic touch and great sense of humour. For example, Sakuragi, the main character is stating himself as a \"genius\" all the time, he believes to be the best even though he is (at the begininng) the worst in Shohoku basketball team. That personality of his is what makes this manga so funny and enjoyable, with that attitude he sometimes get in trouble with captain of the team, Akagi Takenori ( brother of Haruko). Because of his dark skin and extremely tall height, Sakuragi calls Akagi \"Gorilla\" or \"Gori\" , and that sometimes pisses of Akagi, but to readers, in many situations, that is hillarious. Akagi is the captain, best man on the team, leader and he appreciates dedicated person and likes cleanliness, everything that Sakuragi in the beginning isn't. Haruko, crush of Sakuragi on the other hand, likes someone else - Rukawa Kaede. first year student like Sakuargi, talented basketball player who is often silent and favorited by all the girls. And that makes both of them rivals - Sakuragi doesn't like Rukawa because he sees him as an obstacle to Haruko's heart. When Sakuragi makes a mistake in a game, Rukawa always comments on him with his favourite word \"Moron\" comically, which pisses of Sakuragi even more. The chemistry between those two is always funny and interesting to read, with Gorilla Akagi and two other players, Ryota Miyagi and Mitsui Hisashi, the team Shohoku is full of troublemakers, laughter, and great potential to win the National Championship - which is Akagi's dream, and the center of the story. The greatness of the main character Sakuragi is not just his humour and attitude, but in development he experiences through the story. It is how he becomes more mature-like person, a realy sportsman and basketball player. From short tempered and arrogant self calling genius, which  started basket just to get attention from the girl he likes, he begins to realise the importance of practicing, and starts appreciating other people, their hardwork and of course, basketball. That doesn't happen at just one moment in manga, but through the whole story. \
\
There are many other basketball schools, like Ryonan and Kainan, and they also have their stars (some of them are Akira Sendoh, Uozumi Jun, Shinichi Maki), with explained background stories and great personallities.\
I have to mention one of my favourite characters from Slam Dunk - Mito Yohei, one of Sakuragi's best friends from school. He isn't the main character, he doesn't appears to often, but whenever he said something, I liked him more. He is usually silent and cool, but when it comes to making fun of Sakuragi's bad luck with girls, he acts like a kid, he is a good fighter, and understands Sakuragi the best. He is also very happy because of his friend, finding and focusing on something he likes(basketball).\
\
Yep, starting this manga, prepare for many great, inspirational characters and a lot of laughter, heartwarming moments and great way to get more fond of basketball, or any sport. \
\
I don't want to talk much about art, it fits sport manga, good character design, Inoue knows how to express character's feelings through their facial expressions, from panel to panel, they can be drawn pretty funny, like caricatures (when the scene is comic), and they can be drawn pretty serious (when panel is serious). Inoue knows how to tell story with drawings, and none panel doesn't feel unnecessary or out of the place, he is a genius when it comes to telling a story with only pictures - no text. \
\
Ultimate sport manga, the best in its own genre, and even further. It has everything in it, from comedy to sadness, from love story to inspiring sport story, everthing stored in one work. \
\
\
If you haven't read the manga, the rest of the review will be something like a spoiler and my personal disliking , so if you don't want some minor spoilers, stop reading \
- - - - - - - - \
Okay so, the way that manga came to a close. Not the ending, but the way it came to an end. Was it rushed? The last game was perfect - it had everything, but I wanted manga to go on. Inoue introduced many characters for national championship tournament, and were they all used to max potential? No. I can't remember the name but the tall guy with an older serious guy, they were watching game between Shohoku and Sannoh and left saying that Sannoh is winning. Hiroshi Morishige, the arrogant genius who was seen playing by Sakuragi? Maybe after match with Sannoh I wanted to see more of Sendoh apperiance, Sakuragi's bothering past (the thing with his father which he wanted to forget), Kainan match, and than maybe more of Sakuragi's gang, Aota judo guy. There was a big thing for national championship, many characters introduced, and it felt like few of them were forgoten. \

    I've never read sports manga before since I thought they surely must be boring and predictable (with the good guys always winning). Well, excluding Hajime no Ippo, but fist fights have a kinda different feeling to them. Anyway, Slam Dunk was able to hold my attention despite my bias. It wasn't perfect, but it was an enjoyable read. \

The story starts off with... surprisingly little to do with basketball. Basketball is there, but the focus is more on delinquent kinda things. Sakuragi's group of friends add some humour, you can easily relate to the\
          \
        characters, and easily get into the story. \
After that, we get some heated basketball games where the players are filled with insane amounts of passion. The games themselves aren't really that interesting, I think, besides Sakuragi's antics and great plays. There's just something hilarious and satisfying about Sakuragi doing good at the game, as well as when he unwittingly breaks the rules. The final match is really thrilling and well done. It's just a bit of a shame the manga ends the way it does. It feels so... incomplete. \
- - - A R T - - - \
The art is simply outstanding. The basketball players are sometimes drawn with longer limbs to exaggerate their height, but, other than that, the art is quite realistic. The hair is also quite nicely detailed, but half of the characters kinda have 80s hair. \
- - - C H A R A C T E R S - - - \
Eh... there isn't really that much character development or anything. Everyone's kinda just a one man show striving to be the best. Sakuragi is the only character you really get to see grow, which makes him the most interesting. Sakuragi's best friend, Yohei, is also a surprisingly interesting character. He's not just some punk, he's the definition of a true friend. I really respect his character. \
One character that really disappoints me is Haruko. She started out having a very important role in the story, teaching Sakuragi the basics of basketball and helping him improve. She cheers for him and comforts him as a friend, but only has Rukawa in her heart, just like the dozens of other shallow girls. It's fine for comedy at first, but I think her feelings should've changed after a while. It's not that \"the hero has to get the girl\" everytime, but it just felt like what naturally should've happened with the bond they built and care they showed for each other. \
Haruko was just pretty pointless to include for most of the story, really. She was usually just shouting stuff like \"Defense! Defense!\" and \"Go Shohoku!\" from the sidelines. Her character looked cute, I can see why you'd want to include her in a shounen manga for that reason, but that shouldn't be the sole reason. So what if she cheers for the team and cries often? It doesn't build her character nor add anything to the story. \

Overall, this was kinda addictive. The ending was a let down and the basketball games are mostly only moderately entertaining for a person who isn't into sports. It's good, but not as satisfying as it could've been.",

    First of all, I'm gonna make a comparison, this is not Kuroko no Basket at all, it's a whole different concept. Slam Dunk is probably the best manga (in the sports category, although I can say it's one of the best in general) ever published and the anime version is one of the best I have ever seen.\
The story is somewhat considered as simple, I mean, it's a sports manga, you don't need to make it complicated it, nevertherless, the execution is incredible, each chapter is filled with humor, action, drama, and comedy. The anime series was good and worthy of being considered a landmark\
          \
        anime. However there are things that are not shown in the anime series which is why it is crucial for you to read this manga. The interhigh games are a blast! One thing I can reproach to Takehiko Inoue (but that's a selfish thought) is that he could have make more chapters, its ending is quite, well, a full stop. You'll understand if you read it, I really recommend it. \
You guys have to know that back then, in the 90's in Japan, Basket was considered as \"taboo\" in anything related to manga/anime, for the sole reason that basket wasn't developped at all in Japan's highschools and middleschools. The manga and animes which came later, every single one of them were inspired by Slam Dunk. This manga is so well known across Japan because it was the first to achieve so much success.\
The artwork is simply fantastic, if we take in consideration that it was done from 1990 to 1994. I doubt you can find a lot more \"realistic\" manga out there, coming from those years. The characters have something, out-of-manga concept. They still have the general lines which defines a manga, but if you compare it to other ones, you'll understand, you have the impression you can see human faces under these tired and happy \"basketmans\" faces.\
The characters of this title are by far the most fully developed in any title out in the market and I'm not just talking about the main characters, I'm also talking about the supporting cast, even those belonging to rival teams. The character development is so good that it is difficult to choose one character as a favorite. Each character has a well told background even those who appear in just a few chapters have a very detailed and well executed background story. You'll probably remember the names of not only the Shohoku players but also the names of their rivals, most notably \"Sendoh\".\
Overall Slam Dunk is one of the best Manga ever made and I'm sure that once you read it, you will agree with me. I guarantee that you won't be able to resist finishing the manga in a few days if not a few hours because it is that damn good. If you think the anime was great, try reading the manga and I'm sure you'll feel that the anime series could have been better, the interhigh games are one hell of a joyride!",

    Slam Dunk  - The Best Sports Manga\
\"One of the greatest shounen sports in history\" is not a bit exaggerated, is it? Actually, not at all. Before \"One Piece\" robbed the laurels in 2002 as the highest-selling series by volume, Slam Dunk was the one who held that position for 8 years. And, even today, the only series that have managed to get past their success was exactly \"One Piece\" and \"Attack on Titan\".\
Even more surprising that Slam Dunk is, as said, a sports shounen (specifically basketball) who, although he has a good reputation in Japan, usually loses to fight and adventure shounen such as\
          \
        Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, etc. In fact, the second largest sports shounen is Mitsuru Adachi's \"H2\", with the apex of 1.5 million copies by volume 17, against the 2.5 million Slam Dunk by volume 21. And it looks that Adachi also ends up being an exception, most do not reach the millions. \"Kuroko no Basket\", for example, another well-known basketball manga published here, had a maximum of 1 million copies by volume 21.\
In total, Slam Dunk has already surpassed the 120 million volumes sold in the world, counting any versions and re-releases (Tankobon and Kanzenban)\
The fact that an author's manga until that relatively unknown moment of a not-so-famous category thus reaching these heights is by itself impressive. And the fame was so great that it boosted thousands of young people to become interested in basketball, receiving a prize in 2010 by the Japanese Basketball Association precisely because it was so important in popularizing the sport in the country at the time of its launch.\
And how did Slam Dunk get that feat? It is true that the author was in the right place at the right time, with Shounen Jump at its apex. Every week the new magazines brought \"Rurouni Kenshin\", \"Yu Yu Hakusho\", \"Dragon Ball\", \"Dragon Quest\" and several others of unquestionable fame. Being in the middle of works of this suit certainly gave the author the chance he needed, until he even turned the magazine's flagship.\
Slam Dunk is a very simple premise story, in fact, a new year is starting and the Shohoku High School basketball club finds itself in a delicate situation: it urgently needs new players. Meanwhile, Hanamichi Sakuragi begins another school year being rejected for the fiftieth time by a girl, but his luck changes when he meets Haruko, the sister of the current captain of the basketball team who recognizes in the boy the body of a potential athlete. Surprised by the girl's attention, Sakuragi falls in love and begins to try to impress her and after some resistance, he joins the basketball team. From here you follow the mess of the boy and boy your team beyond troublesome.\
The main source of laughter in the story is exactly Sakuragi who lives almost in an alternate reality in his mind, he finds himself the best player in the world and lives in childish and ridiculous quarrels with his own teammates, especially Kaede Rukawa, the \"lady's man\" of the team, for whom Haruko clearly has a downfall.\
The series also features several other charismatic characters and their own stories and problems, whether teammates or rivals from other colleges, of course always accompanied by the distorted and absurd view of Sakuragi, who thinks everyone should be kissing the ground by where he goes.\
Slam Dunk is a great read to chill and laugh, far from having a heavy or questioning story. It's the kind of story you read fast and get frustrated that it's over, wanting to follow more of Sakuragi's antics.\

Personal Note: If you have never read or watched the anime, give volume 1 a try, you might also find a new addiction in the title. I'm saying this because I bought the first Kanzenban volume, of course, in the original Japanese language.\

    Slam Dunk depicts the sport of basketball truthful. No Generation of Miracles but their certainly are some very skilled players in the series, that give our favorite team a run for their money. I was actually really sad when it ended. I wanted more out of the series but I was actually quite pleased with how things ended up wrapping up.\
 Their last game was really intense. It gave a really realistic look at what happens when you fight a really strong opponent. You start to see your weaknesses and that makes the battle difficult but if you can push yourself past your limits in\
          \
        that moment, it’s possible you can surpass those limitation. \
I don't want to spoil the ending but the manga had loose ends in the sense that the mangaka didn't tie them into neat bows like you would expect to when ending a story. It made it feel so much more realistic, as if it's only the beginning for these characters.\
The story starts off with this delinquent Hanamichi, falling in love with a basketball fanatic who only talks to him because he is tall and looks perfect for the game. I gave up on the anime because I was 14 episodes in and all I heard was Hanamichi complaining about basic training, hating Rukawa, and only playing the sport just to be with a girl. Those fourteen episodes made me want to shoot myself and when I got to their first ever practice match in the anime, Hanamichi was being all high and mighty that I wanted to bash my head against something, I couldn’t take it anymore. Resulting in me dropping the anime, instantly. When Hanamichi doesn’t have a voice he is a lot easier to deal with.\
Interestingly enough as the story progressed (in the manga anyway), you really started to see Hanamichi change. Eventually, I started to see him grow into a real basketball player and appreciate even the simple basics of a sport he initial only joined because of a girl. He learned to use his natural talents for his benefit and in 4 short months started to actually look like a basketball player. Also, thank god, for that haircut. His hair was way too flashy even for a delinquent. \
One of the things I was a little disappointed about was Rukawa’s and Hanamichi’s relationship. I was expecting a lot more development in that front. I was expecting a Kagami and Kuroko team up. That did not happen but their relationship did get better. Those two are more the rival type. They egg each other on and even if they piss each other off, they trust each other as team mates or at least that’s what I would like to believe. Those two were difficult to deal with. Even I had moments where I was like really? Your being like this now? At such a critical moment, you should be helping each other out. \
I did not end up being a Rukawa fan girl. I personally could not see the appeal to Rukawa especially with his shitty personality. As much as Hanamichi pissed me off, I could totally relate to him. His fiery nature and his desire to become better. I definitely wanted to cheer him on and see him beat Rukawa. \
I personally got really excited when I was reading the games though I was surprised there weren’t more Slam Dunks considering that’s what the manga is called.\
Hanamichi started basketball because of the girl he liked but ended up falling in love with basketball instead and I am so grateful he didn’t end up confessing. The series honestly would have been ruined for me if that’s what had happened as, that was his only real concern in the beginning.\

    First of all, I'm not a basketball player so my opinions on this would be from a more non-basketball accuracy manga reader. However, most if not all of the content look really accurate, especially with the manga reader being a long time basketball player.\
Let's begin.\
[Story:9/10]\
As much as the story is realistic, with amazing detail and art, sometimes going frame by frame of how the basketball players play, as well as the story focusing on Sakuragi Hanamichi and the Sohoku team of how they progress, there is still some \"too remarkable moments\", especially early on.\
This is pretty amazing already, given how most sports mangas like to\
          \
        perform \"Giant Killing\" using underdogs using a lot of willpower and/or strategy to blow away the rest of the teams/competitors. It's quite amazing how the story flows smoothly as well, given that there are multiple complications, climaxes and comedy. There is hardly one part of the manga that seems out of place, and from start to end as reality is, there are good times and bad times.\
[Art: 10/10]\
I would give 12 if I could, the art is just amazing, especially at various points of the last chapters, where there were a lot of different tones and styles used to highlight certain areas, and detailed skillful drawing of various basketball moves, facial expressions, background and so on.\
[Character: 10/10]\
This is another selection I would like to point out, the character characteristics and backstories of some characters are incredibly explored. However, for the few main characters (5 + 1 actually), a few of them were only touched on surface and there is still little understanding of how the \"incredible rookie\" could possibly be so incredible, aside from talent, a term which I believe every sports manga tries to exploit.\
Still, the amazing portion of the characters might be character development, as we watch how the various characters grow through their toughest periods inside games, as well as what we can learn from their \"experiences\".\
[Enjoyment:10/10]\
I would give a 11 if I could. The emotional rollercoaster and growing potential of both the home team and competitor team alike gives great pleasure to the reader, very much like how I enjoyed reading \"Zatch Bell\". It is where you will not be able to predict much of what will happen next and the suspense hangs thick in the end due to improvements during battles/matches on both sides.\
[Overall:10/10]\
All in all, this manga is amazing, furthermore I had read that Slam Dunk was a manga that popularised basketball in Japan. This is amazing, since this meant that when it was starting, basketball is actually not a hot topic, but the manga managed to catch on to several volumes and even influenced culture.\

    This sport manga about basketball is truly a classic. I watched the anime the first time back in 2010. Then I decided to read the manga in all one go. Here, I'm writing this review after 3 years. I have read this manga 4-5 times already. As I said, it's a classic. It never gets old! And once you start, you cannot stop on reading. The manga is better than the anime, as the pacing for the anime is quite slow, but it is also good watch. \
Story: 8/10. \
Of course, this story is about a man name Sakuragi Hanamichi who is a delinquent and\
          \
        plays basketball all because of one girl. She, obviously likes his supposedly rival. As the story goes on, his love for basketball grows more and more. Turning his attention more than just a game to get Haruko to like him. The story seems like it's been done before right? This was one of the earliest basketball mangas so I can't say it's cliche, but this manga has charm to it. Though it contains aspect of expected scenes, little scenes and parts to it make it up. \
\
Art: 9/10 .\
So, the art for this manga is good. I love how when they get serious, the art gets real nice. It shows lot of the emotions being carry out by the players. Also, especially to the chibi drawings. It really brings out the comedy effect when it needs to show that. \
Character: 9/10. \
I love Sakuragi's character growth in here. From being a childish newbie player to a more refined player who appreciates and enjoy basketball. How his character is from scratch to someone important or find some kind of value in life. I just love this kind of growth in characters. But also, tensai sakuragi's funny comments and his personality. The characters in here really stand out and has realistic feeling to them. \
Enjoyment: 8/10.\
As much as I like this manga, some parts were quite long. But then each time something amazing happens, it never fails to. It really keeps you going and next thing, you're done with the manga. XD\
Overall, 9/10. No need to say more, what's been said above told it all. \

    I'm so happy to see so many reviews with such good vibes regard to this manga, it really makes me happy cus i just finished this like a week ago and i felt like crying when i got to the end, it was just too good, man. I initially started watching the anime, but i wanted more so here i am. \
Basketball itself is such a beautiful sport, i mean, my dad used to play it and he told me all the rules about this, do's & dont's, but i didn't pay attention that much and i regret so bad i didn't play it too.\
          \
        The fact that i found this manga it made me love basketball even more. \
The characters are so well constructed, each one with a different personality, especially the main ones, though my fav is mitsui; i just liked his character development, from good to bad to good again and being so strong mentally and physically. With his perfect 3points shooting, miyagi's agillity, the \"ace\" rukawa, akagi's desperate wish of winning, and our sakuragi who makes the most unexpected moves, manteining the team all together. Sakuragi evolved also as a character so much, he focused on basketball more and more and, i don't know if you guys noticed, but his appearance resembles michael jordan so much, even more after he shaved his hair. And not to forget his best friends who stayed with him when he was letdown and supported him. Best gang ever. Also all those chibi moments in anime and manga were damn funny, haha.\
I must say that the art in this manga is just incredible, with a fine lineart, well contured and those shadowy parts just took my attention, made me see all these details every chapter offered me. Bless the artist. Inoue Takehiko's art it's just perfect. \
After i finished SD, i started reading Vagabond, and everytime the main character is shown (Musashi), all i see is Sakuragi with long dark hair and his sword in his hand. Both of them have aprox. like, the same face's features and resemble each other so well. The artist leaves easily his signature in all his main characters. Takehiko work's in general just catches your attention instantly. \
Overall, if you're into this sport, i say go ahead and give this a chance, cus it really deserves. I reccomend this to all basketball lovers and those who will probably be. \

       It doesn't matter that you don't like sports or don't know anything about basketball, this manga surpasses all those barriers. I started reading this manga knowing as much about basketball as the protagonist, that is, almost nothing. However, unlike other sports anime/manga where you don't even realize there are positions, or what are the rules, in Slam Dunk things are explained by demonstration or by the author himself, and when you realize, you will have learned more than you expected. Most important, and what made this manga so popular, was how hooked people got into basketball after reading Slam Dunk. The protagonist,\
          \
        Sakuragi, just entered the basketball to impress a girl he likes, but as the series progress, his love for game grows, and as the reader you experience similar feelings. \
   It is a realistic take on the genre, there are no special powers of power of friendship. The players get hurt, tired and can be expelled of the game. Even the protagonist have to put his weight in training, he gets better exponentially fast, not only because of his natural talent, but because he puts effort into it. Furthermore the art for the games are so fluid, you don't even realize you are reading a manga.\
   The characters are also excellent, from their motivations, development and charisma.There are no antagonists, that is, a bad guy, the closest to that are the opponents, but they aren't made unlikeable, on the contrary, they are all teenagers that love playing basketball, there isn't any ulterior motive, just the enjoyment of the game.\
    So I recommend this manga for everyone, even for those who don't like the sports genre to take a look. \

 Takenori Akagi is the captain of the Shohoku basketball team and Haruko's older brother. Despite at first not thinking too much of Sakuragi (who addresses him as \"Gori\" for gorilla due to his immense physical presence), he actually realizes Sakuragi's potential as a basketball player. Serious and disciplined, Akagi's dream is to lead Shohoku to the national championship. His determination is shown in the match against Kainan, where he played on despite a serious injury to his ankle. Akagi considers Uozumi of Ryonan to be his biggest rival, though their rivalry is not antagonistic; indeed, there is respect that borders on friendship.\
 \
 Akagi differs from the other starters in two respects. First, he is the most academically talented out of all them and is considered a model student. After the loss to Aiwa knocks Shohoku out of the Nationals, Akagi leaves the team along with Kogure to study for the college entrance exams. In contrast, the other four had to beg their teacher to be given the chance to retake some exams they had flunked; they would otherwise have been disqualified from playing in the Nationals for having failed too many classes. Second, Akagi is the only starter not to have gotten into an actual fight, although he has used physical force against his own players (most notably Sakuragi, and once Mitsui after the gym fight) to keep them in line. He is the only other character besides Rukawa able to take one of Sakuragi's trademark headbutts without being knocked out and the only other character who has had Sakuragi inadvertently dunk a ball on his head (Murasame of Miuradai was the second, in the manga; in the anime, the second one to be dunked on the head is Naito, also from Miuradai).\
 \
 Regarded as the best center in the Kanagawa prefecture, Akagi plays as a fairly typical center, using his height and power to score close to the basket. He also has a reputation for being a virtually unbeatable defender. As captain of the team, he keeps discipline among his players during matches. Akagi met his match during the game against Sannoh, in the form of Masashi Kawata, considered one of the best centers at the high school level. Initially intimidated when Kawata outplayed him, he regained his confidence thanks to Uozumi's encouragement and led his team to victory. \

 Before joining Shohoku, Mitsui Hisashi was an MVP for Takeishi Junior High. Despite having opportunities to join more prestigious high schools like Ryonan, he choose to go to Shohoku because of Coach Anzai; Anzai had given him the courage to win in the Junior High tournament by encouraging him during the last seconds of the match. However, an injury to his left knee in a training session interrupted his basketball career. An imprudent early return to the basketball court reinjured the knee more severely, leading to a basketball hiatus of over a year.\
 \
 Although he eventually healed, he was embittered by his exclusion from the court, and Mitsui quit basketball and became the leader of a gang. His gang got in a fight with Miyagi, and during the fight, Miyagi beat Mitsui senseless before taking a beating himself.\
 \
 Afterwards, Mitsui attempted to ruin the basketball team by instigating them into fighting with his gang, as the team would have been banned from competition for fighting. In the end, Sakuragi's own gang&mdash;Yohei, Takamiya, Ookusu and Noma&mdash;voluntarily took the blame for the fight, and Mitsui was filled with remorse when he saw Anzai again. He rejoined the team and vowed never to fight again.\
 \
 Mitsui is best known on the team as a three-point specialist, though his skills extend to other areas; during a practice match, he once managed to shut down Sakuragi, playing center. His defensive ability completely shut down Fukuda's scoring abilities. His three-pointers helped Shohoku catch up when they were 12 points down against Shoyo, and again when the team was 20 points down against Sannoh in the National Championships. His greatest weakness, though, is his lack of stamina due to his long break from playing basketball. Thus, in the latter halves of games, he has not always been as reliable&mdash;he missed a potential game-winning shot against Kainan and collapsed on-court during the game against Ryonan.\

 There is not much known about Miyagi's background. He joined the basketball team for his love for the game in the first place. But soon it seems that he is also playing for the love of his life Ayako, the team manager. Although Ryonan's coach asked him to join the Ryonan Basketball Team, Miyagi chose for Shohoku because of Anzai. Miyagi is a problem kid, he gets into fights a lot and got himself beaten up. He was also the one who beat Mitsui up, but he had to pay the price of staying in the hospital for some time...\
 \
 Miyagi is quite short, but he has the greatest speed of all players mentioned in Slam Dunk. He has a great dribble and combined with his speed he's able to tear up the opponent's defense and deliver excellent (no-look) passes to the free team mate. He's also able to get a score at his own powers and his steals are just marvelous. Miyagi is a good point guard with a great sight on the game, he's also able to find his team mates without looking for them. He's the strategist of the team, and thanks to this role and his own skills he becomes the next team captain as Akagi retires to focus on exams. By the way, he is also a good street fighter and has a very good flying kick. (Mitsui told)\
 \
 Coach Anzai says that Miyagi's value to the team is his great speed and his keen senses.\
 \
 Miyagi is a smart but kind of rude person, who is only nice and sweet to Ayako... He tried to date other girls to forget Ayako, but he failed to. So he can be a very sensitive person too. In the beginning he mistook Sakuragi for Ayako's boyfriend and got into a fight with him immediately. Later when they found out about each other's painful roads of love, they feel sympathy for each other and start to get along. That's how they became good friends. Miyagi is a bit short tempered sometimes and hates when people make fun of his height. In the match vs Toyotama he gets angry with the opposing point guard, loses his view on the game and almost beats the guy. But in the second half he is able to remain calm again and show his true powers.\

 Kaede Rukawa is Sakuragi's rival as well as almost his opposite; he is attractive to girls, skilled at basketball, and very cold and unfeeling. The only traits they share are that they are not academically inclined and good fighters. He regards Sakuragi as an idiot and both normally fight. Actually, he knows Sakuragi can put his talents to a better use, but is ashamed to see the immaturity with which he deals with things. His hobby is sleeping, and is usually seen asleep whenever he's not on the court; he can even ride his bike while asleep often crashing with objects when doing so. Waking Rukawa from a nap is considered unforgivable, since he will almost automatically beat up the culprit. Unsurprisingly, he has also been in his fair share of off-court fights, but can hold his own. Rukawa's goal is to be the best high school player in Japan, and he considers Sendoh of Ryonan to be his greatest rival. A fact being that he is often nicknamed the \"super-rookie\", the \"ace of Shohoku\", even. \
 \
 Rukawa is extremely good at basketball, and possesses a wide range of skills to complement his height, athleticism and drive to win. Despite being merely a first-year high school player, he is the undisputed ace of Shohoku's team. In the Kanagawa Interhigh Tournament, he was named one of the top five players, the only first year player so honored. He has managed to change the course of many games, such as when he single-handedly brought Shohoku back from a double-digit deficit against Kainan (Rukawa scored 15 straight points for Shohoku in 2 minutes and 5 seconds just before the end of the first half). However, his style was criticized as being too selfish, and he sometimes comes into conflict with his teammates for various reasons; this was one of the reasons why Coach Anzai refused to give him his blessing when Rukawa told him that he intended to go to the USA, and told him to become the best in Japan before he even thought of it. When he was outplayed by Sawakita during the match against Sannoh Technical, though, he realized what Sendoh reminded him as a challenge: To defeat Sendoh, Rukawa had to change his style and pass the ball. It was his pass that led to Hanamichi's buzzer-beating shot, winning the match. Rukawa is subsequently named a member of the All-Japan basketball team. \

 The protagonist. At the beginning of the series, Sakuragi was a slacker, always trying to ask girls out but getting constantly rejected (the 50th rejection occurring at the start of the series). He then met Akagi Haruko, with whom he fell in love immediately. This passion led to him joining the Shohoku basketball team. However, as a complete beginner, he was not able to keep up with the rest of the team at first despite his physical attributes (great height, athleticism, stamina, speed and leaping ability). He regards himself as a genius though, with self-confidence that borders on arrogance. His most recognizable trait is his red hair, though he shaves his head as reparation for an error that led to the loss against Kainan.\
 \
 At first, Sakuragi was known for his poor basketball skills as a beginner; in his first few official matches, he fouled out every game. However, his basketball skills advanced throughout the series. First he developed his basic skills, such as dribbling and layups. Then, trained by Akagi, he became a formidable rebounder; his rebounding became his claim to fame throughout the latter half of the series. He also is seen more than once defining the match for Shohoku in the last seconds, for instance, by dunking a ball that Akagi would have missed in the league round match with Ryonan. His jump shooting was then developed by Coach Anzai, who had him make 20,000 shots in a week. He hit a buzzer-beating jump shot to win the match against Sannoh. However, he also injured his back during the match against Sannoh, and underwent rehabilitation after Shohoku's subsequent loss to Aiwa Academy.\
 \
 In spite of the setbacks he has had to face, Sakuragi displays a great deal of tenacity and determination that carry him through and help reciprocate for his other failings, both on and off the court. Although his love for Haruko and rivalry with Rukawa are the main driving forces motivating him to succeed in basketball, his injury during the Sannoh match makes him realize that he has actually come to love the game, leading him to give his all for his team and bring them victory. \

His catchphrase is \"gotta check it,\" aside from shouting \"Unbelievable!!!\" every time something exciting happens during a match. He too considers Hanamichi a great player, because he was talked into it when they first met. Hikoichi also idolizes Ryota because he is a starter for Shohoku despite his short height (Ryota is only three centimeters, about one inch, taller than Hikoichi). He has an older sister, Yayoi Aida, who is a reporter for a basketball magazine (and from whom Hikoichi might have gotten his habit of taking notes). \

 Haruko is Takenori's younger sister and Sakuragi's love interest. Sweet and with a captivating personality, Haruko is always around to cheer on the players, especially her brother Takenori (who is extremely protective of her and taught her the basics of basketball) and Sakuragi, whom she considers as her best friend. Haruko often appears at matches together with Sakuragi's cohorts and her two best friends, Fujii and Matsui. She, like most girls in Shohoku High, only has eyes for Kaede, although he never reciprocates her feelings and, later in the anime, she acknowledges that he won't love her the way she wants him to and tries to let go of her crush, however not successful.\
 \
 Haruko was responsible for uncovering Sakuragi's athletic talent after seeing him try to dunk a ball at her request - she was impressed by the height of his jump and considered him good enough to join the team. Hanamichi always listens to Haruko, due to his deep affection for her. They have gone on some (what Sakuragi considers) non-official dates and have occasionally trained together.\
 \
 Despite her emotional denseness and sweetness, Haruko is a pretty good student (she helped Akagi tutor Sakuragi and the other three starters when they had to retake some tests) and is not afraid to stand up for others when needed. She confronted Sakuragi when she mistakenly thought that he had attacked Rukawa, and she also defended him many times from Kaede's most rabid fangirls (one of them even knocked her to the ground in the anime series).\

      description = "The coach of the Shohoku High basketball team, and one of the best ones in Japan. Even the coaches of other teams call him \"Anzai-sensei\" with respect. His calm and collected attitude contrasts with the temper he had in the past, when he was nicknameed \"White-Haired Devil\" as a demanding college coach. \
 A talented player, Ryuji Yazawa, trained under him and was eyed with high regard by Anzai. However, Yazawa was unhappy about Anzai's tough training for him (especially the repetitive and strenuous basic technique training), and against the Coach's wish, left Japan to play in the USA, where he thought he would have better opportunities to show his talent. 5 years passed without any news, other than an unaddressed video tape showing Yazawa playing in a team, whose players had virtually no concepts of teamwork. One day Anzai learned from the press that Yazawa died in a high-speed head-on car collision, reportedly under drug influence. While visiting Yazawa's grave, Yazawa's mother gave Anzai a letter written 4 years prior, which Yazawa never had the courage to post back. In the letter, Yazawa expressed profound regret about his rebellious decision to leave, and the depression from his experience in the unsupportive American college basketball career. Anzai grieved deeply for the loss of Yazawa and resigned from college basketball coaching ever since. This also changed Anzai's former strict attitude to his now mild temper, for which he is now known as the \"White-Haired Buddha.\"\
 \
 Sakuragi always calls Coach Anzai \"Oyaji\" (old man) and has the habit of jiggling his fat when hyped, which makes the others - Mitsui in particular - mad at him, as this is considered disrespectful. Anzai, however, appears to tolerate this and has not reprimanded Sakuragi for his behavior. However, Anzai did punish the four players (Mitsui, Miyagi, Sakuragi and Rukawa) involved in the fight against Mitsui's gang, by initially benching them during the first interhigh tournament match against Miuradai High School.\
 \
 However behind such an impassible demeanor is a brilliant strategist, who always knows how to turn the tide of a match for his team. Anzai like Haruko Akagi, realized Sakuragi's potential early on and decided to make him a starter even though some of his basketball skills were not yet par. Recognizing that shooting was Sakuragi's weakness, he made him make 20,000 baskets in a week to get ready for the national tournament. Anzai is also very charismatic and able to inspire his players to greater heights, as evidenced before the match against Sannoh, where he managed to bring down the insecurity within Miyagi, Mitsui and, to a lesser extent, Sakuragi. Although they were directly recruited by Coach Moichi Taoka of Ryonan, both Mitsui and Ryota turned him down, citing Anzai's presence at Shohoku as the primary factor. Mitsui respects Anzai the most, and once put a picture of him on the bench and prayed to it when Anzai was unable to come to the inter-high Shohoku-Ryonan match due to heart attack.\

He once tried to make Sakuragi join the judo team because he considered his fighting skills exceptional, and to achieve this, \"bribed\" him with some photos of Haruko when she was younger. Still, Sakuragi refused, saying simply, \"because I'm a basketball player\" (actually because he knew he would actually be closer to Haruko if he stayed with the basketball team). But Tatsuhiko does not give up on trying once in a while. He is rather loyal to Takenori when the need arises, cheering him on when he is outplayed and hard-pressed during the second Ryonan match.  \
 Despite his inability to physically coerce Sakuragi into joining the judo team, Tatsuhiko has proven that he is skilled, as he is the sole member of the judo team to qualify for the National Championships in judo. It is also worth noting that Tatsuhiko has had a crush on Haruko since they were young. She calls him \"Ta-chan\" instead of by his last name, which irritates Sakuragi immensely. \

She is directly responsible for sharpening Hanamichi's abilities for real matches, by training him in the basics, such as ball possession and dribbling. Her disciplinary style is midway between Akagi and Anzai - while not as soft as the latter, she is also not as hard as the former. Her last name is unknown. Curiously, Hanamichi treats her almost as respectfully as Anzai, even though she is in a lower position in the team; possibly because of her gender, since he is generally more respectful towards females. Ryota refers to her as \"Aya-chan\" because of his attraction to her, and she responds by calling him \"Ryota\" rather than by his surname.  \

 Hanagata is considered one of the top centers in the Kanagawa prefecture. He mixes strength and tactical skill in his playing, being able to easily avoid defensive play. When Fujima is not on court, he takes the role of captain, being responsible for psyching up the team. For this, he is quite a trustworthy player for Shoyo. He is known for his fade away shot, which is difficult to block. Hanagata is the only starter shown to wear glasses, though they are knocked off his face when Sakuragi commits his fourth foul, and Hanagata plays the rest of the match without them.\
 \
 Hanagata hold his own in the Shohoku match against Akagi, but when he is matched up with Sakuragi, he is totally outclassed in rebounding. Being a top center, he is quite agile for his height. He takes on the cudgels of scoring for his team when Fujima is not on the court. He also knows how to use his teammates effectively. He and Nagano are knocked off by Sakuragi after the latter dunked on them, but despite the effort Sakuragi still got his fifth foul. Nevertheless, he is cheered by the fans. Hanagata also missed a desperate three-point attempt against Shohoku, marking the final score, 62-60.\

Before Sakuragi and his Gang arrive, Hotta and his cronies run into Rukawa on the school roof, who singlehandedly knocks out all four of them.  \
 Hotta is a good friend of Mitsui, and backed him up when he challenged Miyagi to a fight a year ago. He and his friends provide the muscle again after Miyagi returns, and they join Mitsui in his attack on the basketball team. From Kogure's revelation of Mitsui's prior history with basketball, Hotta realizes that Mitsui deep down wants to play again, and is persuaded by Sakuragi's Gang to share the blame with them for attacking the team, getting the team off the hook for fighting. It should be noted that though Hotta and his friends failed to win in fights against Sakuragi's Gang or even Rukawa, they are portrayed as among the best fighters in Shohoku. Hotta and his cronies later become supporters of the basketball team during the National Championship Tournament (though even they get scared by the aggressiveness of the Toyotama crowd), largely because of their friendship with Mitsui, who they give the epithet Honoo no Otoko (lit. \"Flaming Man\"). \

 Nobunaga Kiyota is what could be called the personification of arrogance (something like Kainan's parallel to Sakuragi, only slightly more skilled during the events of the Kanagawa Trials). He is always bragging about how he's the real star rookie of Kanagawa, instead of Rukawa. However, he tends to underestimate other teams, especially Shohoku, and this can lead to embarrassing situations, such as when Akagi flattened him with a dunk, and also when Sakuragi faked past him and scored.

 \
 Kiyota is known for his leaping ability and ball-handing skills. Despite being only 178 cm, he can dunk and block shots quite regularly. He memorably dunked over Uozumi during Kainan's match against Ryonan despite Uozumi's height. Kiyota is the only starter for Kainan who is a 1st year.\

 Maki plays mostly as a point guard, although he has the all-round skills to play in virtually any other position. Extremely muscular and strong, he likes to use his physical attributes to drive into the lane to score while drawing fouls. His scoring ability is incredibly difficult to stop and in one game four players from Shohoku were needed to completely shut him down. When teams double or triple-team him, he can then pass the ball to open teammates on the perimeter, such as Soichiro Jin, for open three-point shots. Maki uses his height and power to create mismatches against other point guards, which his team usually capitalizes on effectively. \

 Eiji Sawakita is considered Japan's No.1 High School Player, and is the ace of Sannoh. Unlike many other characters who are extremely skilled as he is, he has a goofy attitude sometimes, and has comical moments of extreme shock when an opponent does something impressive. It was known that the high profile player, like Rukawa, has many fangirls that sends him fan mails. Masashi, on the other hand, has none and picks on Eiji because of this.\
 Sawakita plans to go to America following the summer's Interhigh Tournament.\
 \
 Skills:\
 Eiji Sawakita is the best all-round player in Japanese high school basketball. His offensive ability is nearly unstoppable and is equally matched by his defensive ability. It is rumoured that no one in high school, not even college, can beat him in a one-on-one match. Rukawa attempts to play him one-on-one in the second round of the National Championships, but Sawakita proves that he was the better player and shut down Rukawa's scoring, forcing him to change tactics. His offensive power is very strong as it forces Rukawa to fail everytime and it made Rukawa with only one choice left which is to pass the ball to his team mate. Sawakita is known to be the best player within the history of Sannoh as he is currently holding the title of \"Japan's #1 High School Player\". His defensive skills is just as strong as his offensive skill to which he think that Rukawa dribbling is weak as he almost stole the ball on alot of occasion. He is currently unmatch in a 1 vs 1 match. He also beaten Sendoh of Ryonan High( who known as a genius) in their middle school days.\
 \
 Early childhood:\
 Sawakita was taught basketball by his father Tetsuharu \"Tetsu\" Sawakita, who played him one-on-one since he was four years old. The first present recieved by Eiji was a basketball when he was just an infant.Eiji got bored by the toy net in his house and that is when his father bought a house with a real basketball net. His father would play with him every sunrise and sunset.\
 Primary and Junior High days:\
 There was no basketball club in primary school and Eiji played with his father with the goal of beating his father. When he entered Junior high, he finally beat his father. In the club he easily beat his seniors who were starters in tournaments, commenting that playing with them is boring. His seniors were unhappy about his cocky attitude and beat him out of jealously.\
 Sawakita beat Sendoh when they played each other in junior high, to which Sendoh note that he the only person that he lost to before in a one on one match. Sawakita is probably the best player in his middle school days also as he is currently Japan's #1 High School Player right now.\

 Jun Uozomi is the team captain. He considers Takenori Akagi his rival, but has never managed to personally beat him, although Ryonan has beaten Shohoku on occasion. However their rivalry is not antagonistic; indeed, there is respect that borders on friendship. When Akagi was outplayed and discouraged in the match against Sannoh, Uozumi was able to restore Akagi's spirits. After the loss to Shohoku in the Kanagawa prefectural trials eliminated Ryonan from national competition, Uozumi left the team to train as a chef, since his family owns a ramen restaurant; Sendoh succeeds him as team captain. Sakuragi likes to refer to him as \"Boss Monkey\" because he is as well-built as Akagi, and even taller.\
 \
 Uozumi's size and power are unmatched in high school basketball. However, he started as a very weak player, and was ridiculed and bullied by his upperclassmen for only having height but very little of everything else. Ryonan's coach Taoka Moichi encouraged him to continue playing though, and eventually Uozumi developed into becoming a fearsome center. He is considered as one of the top centers in the Kanagawa prefecture. However, his bad temper and lack of control in game situations has led to serious consequences for his team on more than one occasion; during the second match with Shohoku, Hanamichi tricked him into committing four fouls and almost got him ejected.\

 Yasuharu Yasuda is quiet and comes across as shy or nervous most of the time, although he is brave and willing to put himself in dangerous positions to stand up for his teammates, as shown in the fight between the team and Mitsui and Tetsuo when they were trying to get the basketball team banned. Due to his calm character and personality he has the ability to change and slow the pace of the game. The example of this is when he was put into the game against Toyotama in place of Sakuragi after the team had become flustered and began making poor decisions as a result of Toyotama's style of play. Yasuda successfully changed the flow of the game in Shohoku's favour. \

  synopsis = "Hanamichi Sakuragi, a tall, boisterous teenager with flame-red hair and physical strength beyond his years, is eager to put an end to his rejection streak of 50 and finally score a girlfriend as he begins his first year of Shohoku High. However, his reputation for delinquency and destructiveness precedes him, and most of his fellow students subsequently avoid him like the plague. As his first day of school ends, he is left with two strong thoughts: \"I hate basketball\" and \"I need a girlfriend.\" Haruko Akagi, ignorant of Hanamichi's history of misbehavior, notices his immense height and unwittingly approaches him, asking whether or not he likes basketball. Overcome by the fact that a girl is speaking to him, the red-haired giant blurts out a yes despite his true feelings. At the gym, Haruko asks if he can do a slam dunk. Though a complete novice, Hanamachi palms the ball and makes the leap...but overshoots, slamming his head into the backboard. Amazed by his near-inhuman physical abilities, Haruko quickly notifies the school's basketball captain of his feat. With this, Hanamichi is unexpectedly thrust into a world of competition for a girl he barely knows, but he soon discovers that there is perhaps more to basketball than he once thought.
