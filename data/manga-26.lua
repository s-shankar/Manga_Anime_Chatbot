		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=191,  ["text"]="          \n    Welcome to the world of Hunter X Hunter where people pursue to become Hunters. But to become one, one must undergo the Hunter Exam. Thousands of people participate in this exam. Among them is a kid name Gon Freecs who longs to meet his father, a great hunter, but in order to do so, he must become a great Hunter and follow his footsteps. Along the way, he meets Killua, a kid whose family is famous for being assassins, Kurapika, a kind and loyal friend but at times reckless due to his revenge motive and Leorio, a brash man who aims to be a successful\n          \n        Hunter specializing in medical treatments. \nYoshihiro Togashi is the same guy who wrote the 1994 hit YuYu Hakusho, a successful long running shounen. And this manga is no exception.\nNearly all long-running shounens throughout anime history has already been labeled  tedious, dull and unimaginative. Without fail, HxH will relieve you of that perspective.\nHxh simply has it all. Action, check. Pragmatic characters, check. Psychological contest, check. It can be a psychological thriller or an action-packed manga. Either way, HxH is superbly crafted. \nThe anime played out with touches of pathos and humor creating a superb atmosphere. The manga provided numerous slap-stick comedies to lighten the mood a little. But when its serious, its serious. The intensity of HxH cannot be denied.\nWhile it isn't groundbreaking in the concept aspect, the real treat is in the execution. Supernatural abilities aside, this manga undertakes a realistic approach. The little things actually matter from getting adapting your eyes to the dark to increasing efficiency on running, every small thing counts. This results to intense an conflict for both the mind and the muscle during battle's. HxH concentrate's on the adventure aspect more so than the fighting aspect. So dont expect any out-of-this-world 'sudden power outbursts' to save the day because HxH wont allow it. And thats one of the many things you'll like bout this manga.\nRegardless of this, HxH still proves to be enough to considered an action. The action does play it safe but it is still highly invigorating. It succeeds in keeping many readers on their toes, and often leaves readers with cliffhangers that are big and small.\nThe rather slow paced scripts are fleshed out with a set of tremendous central and supporting characters.  The various other characters and factions involved in playing the manga do not end up seeming flat. They take the time to develop and flesh out even some of incidentally encountered characters appearing only for a chapter even if it would have been easier to simply have them appear for their necessary encounters without giving us any real insight into their personality. \nAlso character developments are a plus. While Gon remains static, Killua and Kurapika in particular, goes through massive changes throughout the manga . \nTo some the art is horrible. But I dont think its bad at all. I mean, it isnt amazing but is simply good. Another issue is the amount of text. Sometimes it can be overwhelming to the reader, since HxH will rain you with texts everywhere on the panel. HxH doesnt want to seem miss any explanations and leave some plot holes. It wants to be rational, as much as possible. Incredible sense of detail shows in key points of the story.\nOnce you reach the Hunter Exams, everything will shift to overdrive. If that arc doesnt interest you in the slightest, I suggest you stop reading it from there as by that time, it should have caught your attention.\nThis anime is light years ahead of all shounen out there. No shounen anime holds a candle to Hunter X Hunter when it comes to being ardent and scrupulous. Amidst all monotonous shounen that have come out on the heels, HxH was able to crank it up a notch.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=133,  ["text"]="             \n    This my favorite manga of all time, so I may be a little biased when it comes to this review. I love every work that Yoshihiro Togashi puts out! I'm not exactly sure what a typical shounen is, so i'll just start by saying that it starts out with a boy named Gon Freecs going on the most challengeing hunt of his life, to find his elusive hunter father. And the story shows his development as a hunter throughout.\nStory: 9/10\nI give the story a 9 because the first 12 or so volumes had a great story and a lot character devolopment with the four main\n          \n        characters but lately it has had the tendency to exclude Leorio and Kurapika. Just focusing on Gon and Killua. The hiatuses kept it pretty hard to maintain the excitement that I had in the beginning. The chimera ant arc and the current arc seemed dragged out and the chimera ant arc ended unclimactic and extremely depressing. How they get their powers or nen is very original and fits their personalities but at times can be confusing as to what nen type some characters are, i.e. Silva and Zeno. But it seems like Togashi couldn't let go of some powers from Yu Yu Hakusho. such as Karasu's powers-genthru, Rinku's yo yos-killua, so for me it went from a 10 to a 9.\nArt: 10/10\nI give the art a 10 because even though there isn't a lot of scenery and backgroung stuff like Naruto has at times the characters are very oringinal and the fight scenes are clear and at times shown complex fighting positions that can be difficult to draw even for experienced aritists. Unlike Bleach that at times has like a blur then someones bleeding to death.\nCharacters: 10/10\nIf I could give this higher than a 10, I would. This to me is the best part of the manga and why I fell in love with it. The characters are extremely well developed and well drawn. All the protagonists' stories are at least mentioned and have a lot of detail so you understand why they are what they are. The bad guys you fall in love with too. Well, I'm not really sure if Hisoka's really a bad guy. But the delopment of their powers is awesome. It's not like DBZ where people always turn super saiiyan or use the spirit bomb everytime the bad guy seemed unbeatable. \nEnjoyment: 9/10\nIt would have gotten a 10 if not for the several hiatuses that it had. \nOverall: 10/10\nAs I said, it is my favorite manga. The plot seems to be getting back on track. So then I may put another review when it gets going again.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=44,   ["text"]="               \n    Okay, to start off, I'm going to go on a little tirade about the early chapters of this manga's art. If you don't care or whatever, then keep scrolling until you see \"TIRADE END\", I guess, haha.\n*TIRADE START*\nWhen I read this manga, I was shocked that the art style of the manga that managed to tie with OP was so bad. It actually looked a lot like my current art style.\nI was actually sort of happy. \nYou see, I'm an aspiring mangaka (bleh, I know that's not what you call it outside of Japan, but bleh), and I was always thinking that my art style\n          \n        was so bad and that no one would publish my work.\nBut when I look at Togashi's art style in the early chapters of HxH, and saw how bad it was and how popular it is, it fills me with hope.\nIf Togashi could become as popular as Eichiro, despite his art being god awful, then I think I just might have a chance in the manga world.\n*TIRADE END*\nMmkay, anyway...\nStory:\nThe story is flawless. I love the Phantom Troupe. They're so shady, but in a sophisticated way. It's charming, so to speak.\nThe Greed Island was a curveball, but turned out to be pretty good despite some flaws.\nCharacters:\nGon and Killua are the funniest pair ever. Killua's always yelling at Gon, and Gon's always shoving it off. They're a hilarity train wreck. Hisoka is amusing, not that likeable, but amusing.\nOverall Enjoyment: \nPretty good. I do love this anime/manga. Would I rewatch it? Debatable. It's not that up there in my top favorite anime, but I do enjoy it.\nI just hope Togashi lives long enough to finish this manga =/ The tragedy with Kaze no Stigma musn't happen again!\n"},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=20,   ["text"]="          \n    \"Monstrous Animals, Rare Species...Buried Riches, Hidden Treasures...Worlds of Demons, Unexplored Lands...The Word 'UNKNOWN' Seems Magic...And Some Men Are Attracted By This Force...They Are Called 'HUNTERS'!\"\n     This is the introductory that meets the reader in the very 1st chapter of the 1st volume of the Hunter X Hunter manga. Having had already watched the anime, I am aware of what Hunter X Hunter is about so the introduction wasn't anything new. Someone who hasn't ever encountered Hunter X Hunter, however, will probably feel disappointed to eventually find out that the manga isn't really about a treasure-hunt or a great adventure into some\n          \n        unique, hidden world.\n     The manga is, in the beginning, about a boy named Gon who joins a Hunter test (a test composed of various practical examinations on anything that the judge wants for the examinees to prove that they deserve the title \"HUNTER\") in order to find his father, who seems like a popular Hunter who has done a lot of great things. It is during this examination that Gon meets and befriends three other examinees. \n     At this point in the manga, it seems that the four of them - each with distinct abilities, personality, and reason for taking the Hunter Exam - are the main protagonists in the story. The story itself is interesting because the goals of the protagonists and the challenges they have to go to achieve these goals are quite interesting.\n     My problem with the manga is that as the story progressed, the plot was solely focused on two of the four protagonists so that the story evolved around them for more than 10 volumes (TEN! TEN! ARGH!!). And I mean FOCUS in a way that as if there has never been the four of them when the story started. Although Gon and Killua's goal (to find Gon's father) isn't boring, the biggest problem I have with it is that the same thing happens every time they find a new clue about where Gon's father could be: clue->new place->new enemies->realize they're not strong enough->meet a master who says the same thing: \"they have a lot of potential!\" or \"who are these kids??\"->train->become stronger->defeat enemy who will eventually say the same thing: \"these kids are strong, blah, blah\"->find a new clue->and it goes on and on and on...\n     After some time, this becomes really annoying because the story just keeeeeeeeeeeeps dragging on. This is also the same reason I stopped watching Bleach so yeah X) "},

It's as if a little kid was scribbling on a piece of paper, and that being published. Shitty artwork, with too much text in one page.\nCHARACTERS: Terrible characters. Gon is a basic shounen character, naive and generic. Leorio is an awful character that barely has any time in this manga, no development whatsoever. The other 2 get development, but Killua is overrated. The only development he had, was becoming more gay for gon.  Kurapika is the only good character of the\n          \n        4.Did I forget to mention the fact that there are no good villains? Meruem is an overrated piece of shit. A shitty character that does nothing but play japanese chess all day cant even be considered one of the best villains. Things that make a good villain: Motive, Backstory, Development, Meruem has none of these. The other villains don't fill the criteria either. \nENJOYMENT: It's hard to enjoy a manga with such terrible artwork. No I didn't enjoy this manga at all. It's also hard to enjoy a manga that only has one well written arc. \nSTORY/PLOT: The story is awfullly generic. Funny cause gon does more training, rather than trying to accomplish his goal. First off, the Greed Island arc is pointless. The only important thing that happened in that shitty arc was the volleyball match. Other then that, the arc is fucking filler. Infact most story arcs are terrible. The Zoldyck arc is terrible. The Yorknew City arc is awful, and not well written whatsoever. No good villains with depth. The only good thing about the arc was the action, and Kurapikas character development (good action doesn't make the arc go from a 1/10 to 2/10 though) but it isn't well written in the slightest. The villains are just evil, just for the sake of being evil, nothing interesting about that trash. The Greed Island arc was a shit show. Most of the arc was focused on training rather than the game, which is already a bad thing. Even worse, every time the focus is on the game, it's always shit. Just watching them collect cards that no one gives a shit about, fighting shitty villains with no good villain qualities whatsoever, what a shit show. \nNow, I would be giving out the long list of plot holes and asspulls that this terrible manga has, but I cant spoil anything. \n\nENJOYMENT: It's hard to enjoy a manga with such terrible artwork. No I didn't enjoy this manga at all. It's also hard to enjoy a manga that only has one well written arc. "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="            \n    ( Sorry english isn't my first language (; 3 ;) )\nHunter X Hunter is one of the longest ongoing manga in Weekly Shonen Jump since 1998. Sadly, this masterpiece is really have annoying hiatus often, so unlike One Piece that published from 1997 have almost 700 chapters in 2012. Hiatus X Hiatus (Hunter X Hunter I mean) only made half of it, 340 chapters and hiatus again in 2012.\nBut, what makes this manga really addictive to the reader? What makes it adapted into amazing anime twice (1999 & 2011)? The answer can only you get after you read this manga. So, I'm going to review\n          \n        this from my point of view, I hope this can be useful.  \nStory 10 :\nThe story of HXH is around a 12 years old boy named Gon Freeccs who travels throught the World of Hunter in order to search for his father, on the ways he meets many places and people. \nLike any other Shonen Manga HXH have many arcs, every arc has their own story. \nBut unlike average Shonen manga that can only battle, battle, and battle thanks to the creative author of HXH \nwho write Yu Yu Hakusho before, the story is creative too. Can you imagine how a 12 years old boy compete with hundreds chalengger to life or dead examination? How about came to see a friend from Famous Assassin family that can kill you anytime,\ncame to the headquartes of many psycho bandit, or fight with deadly ants that really like to eat human being?? The story of HXH can be very enjoying, exiting, thiller, great action, and also dark. So, from my point of view, the story of HXH is masterpiece.         \nArt 7 :\nActually, the art is good too, but some chapter can be very simple. The background is totally white and the character is bad looking, maybe the author is too rush for the deadline so he doesn't really care about his art. Well, whatever it's annoying so I give only 7. \nCharacter 10 :\nHXH's Main characters are four althought the story goes, the Greed Island and Chimera Arc only have Gon & Killua as main character :\n- Gon Freeccs is the main character of this story. A naive and stubborn 12 years old boy, the type who action without thinking and really fit to be HXH main character. But his personality can make him strong willed, brave, cool, and awesome main character. When he's serious he can sacrifice everything even it cost his live.\n- Killua Zaoldyeck is the second main character, althought he's the last introduced in the story after leorio & kurapika but he is the closest character to Gon. He has quiet and calm personality, he can kill people without doubt because he's an asassin but in the other hand can be very fun and aloof expecially when he faced Gon. Because his looks and personality, Killua is the most popular character in HXH so far.       \n- Leorio Paladiknight is one of the main character in HXH, althought his age only few years older than Kurapika but he has the oldest looking so he looks like an Uncle. He has cheerful and idiotic personality so the story can be very fun whenever he there.\n- Kurapika Kuruta is a guy, don't make a mistake because he really like a girl. At first arc of the story, Kurapika has easygoing personality and really close to Leorio almost like a couple. But later in the story, Kurapika personality changed to more serious expecially when he faced Genei Ryodan.\n - There are many interesting character besides the four main, like Hisoka who is the major supporting character that almost appear every arc in the story. \nThe development of character can be very influenced in this Story, the gap between strong and weak character is real, not any suprising power that came from nowhere.  HXH not hesitate to kill his own major character because new appeareance of many Strong characters.\n So I give the character 10 beacuse the development.\nEnjoyment 9 :\nI really enjoy reading this manga, HXH has become everything you wanna' read like nice story, cool action, fun comedy, interesting dialogue, etc. I think maybe this manga is really addictive like a drugs it's readers.\nWhen HXH back from hiatus, I can't wait the next week to read the continuation of the story. Actually, I can give 10 to the enjoyment but like I said before, I give only 9 because the art can become really bad looking.  \nOverall 9 :\nWell, (10+7+10+9)/4=9 So overall I give 9. Must read to someone who really like long published Shonen Manga, expecially after the Greed Island arc because it's not airing yet in both animes. I hope this review can be useful for you.\n        "},

I mean, Hunterxhunter.\nI would've given this manga a 10 if the mangaka would hurry up instead of making excuses for a taking a 2 year hiatus like being sick. ( ´ ▽ ` )\nStory:\nThe story is actually really interesting for me. Going on an adventure to find your dad with making new amazingly tough friends (like Killua) and getting into trouble while still hanging on gives me tears. The one small thing that bothers me is that even though the dad is so cool and strong in my opinion but is so lazy, unlike his hardworking son ,is kinda crappy. Other than that, the\n          \n        fights are amazing especially with Gon and Killua always there trying their best.\nArt: \nThe art is SPECIAL in a way. It reminds me of a weird comic instead of a manga because sometimes the faces aren't detailed like in the anime (1999 and 2011 versions) but they're still well drawn.\nCharacter:\nI love the characters even if they are always small and always look the same when they're 12-14/15 years old. Gon has that happy-go-lucky personality that makes everyone root for him and want to be his friend. He's not the smartest person in the world but that is what makes the manga funny. Killua has that cool vibe to him that is...well... cool. Sometimes there are those moments where he'll have the scariest/most menacing face to protect his best friend and other times when Gon tells him something nice like \"Thanks and etc.\" he has a cute little blush which will make you love him too.\nEnjoyment: \nI really enjoyed this manga with all the action and comedy that could break any awkward moment.\nOverall:\nOverall, I gave this a 10 so you'll probably enjoy the manga/anime as much as I did.\n        "},

The characters are really well develop,you are gonna love some of the characters good or evil. Most people see this story has an shonen battle manga but yet it is not like that at some points at the story, some part of the story will use challenges for the main or secondary characters in were the need to use the intellectual to beat the enemy. Every arc has is own unique style with different objectives that will not make you bored of the story. This is a great manga one may said that is\n          \n        a legendary one, but it has is down falls, some of parts of the story made drag for many chapters leaving a long speeches and some cases with no drawing, this may turn off the casual reader if they are looking for a fast pace manga, yet the author rewards the reader with some awesome moments at the end of every arc. This story has some moments with gore parts so be ware of those parts if you are not in that kind of stuff. I highly recommend for the casual reader that go watch the anime 2011 version first, by far it the best adaptation of the manga, but if your are a hardcore manga reader like myself and had not read this manga i highly recommenced to read this manga because it one of the greatest you ever read. I warn you this story has not ended and may never be finish so beware if you don't like that kind of manga.      \n        "},

He thought it all up. The world of HXH, when we think of it, makes you realize many things about our own world, and makes you question many of our morals and mentalities. This masterpiece was elegantly written, no fillers, and every action counts. Realistic reactions to many events. this manga leaves you in a wreck of emotions: there are funny moments, there are heartwarming moment, an then there are those very dark moments when you least expect them.\n          \n        The plot devices were very well put and they weren't 'just there'.\nThe problem with the manga are the long hiatus, but even though we can never deny this awesome manga.\n\nArt: 7/10 (the first 4 arcs), 6.5/10 (the greed island arc) , 3/10 (the chimera ant arc), then back to 7/10 at the last arc:\nThe art at first was decent, but then it turned appalling. The story made up for the art, because nobody would want to miss such a genius story no matter what.\nCharacter: 12/10\nGon: He isn't the typical protagonist who had a tragic backstory but then wants to pursue his goal to prove something. He is a curious kid that was abandoned by his father, which leads to him questioning what is so great about being a hunter, and this is his goal: wanting to know the charm of being a hunter. His character seems to be simple at first, but read it carefully, and you will know he isn't the typical \"simple naive kid who helps everybody because he is a good kid who believes we need to help others\". True, he has great personality, but he's also very veeery flawed.\nKillua: Tragic backstory, but as you get to know him, he's not what he seems.  I can't say anything or I will spoil the fun of finding out.\nKurapika: He has the typical tragic-hero backstory, but he doesn't act like a typical hero. He is pursuing his goal, but- I am not gonna spoil it. I have many things to say about each character but THEY WILL BE SPOILERS!!!....\nLeorio: He is the most normal of them all. His tragic backstory is something that happens everyday and can happen to any person. Also don't wanna spoil anything..\nAS for the other characters, they are all a mix of people that seem unrealistic, but this is not true...You can find many of the traits of those characters in people you know, or even yourself...For example what they do, we don't really do it in real life, but if given the freedom, we will do it.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nNot a moment felt too dull. The story is so well written that even with the bad art in the chimera ant arc, you still want to read it. The way every character and every event is portrayed, makes you look back and think about many things. I loved and enjoyed this manga so much.\nOverall: 10/10\nThe art was decent at first, but he needs to hire an assistance, because of the reason that he does all the art himself, he can't finish on the deadline and the quality of his art drops so fast in the 6th arc...Anyway this is not the point.\nThis manga can't deserve any lower than this. Even with the quality of art at the end, and his looooong hiatus, it can't be less than a 10. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="              \n     	This manga does everything a shounen manga should do. When I think of the perfect manga, I think of Hunter X Hunter. This review is about the series as a whole.\nThe fights are amazing. Each hunter has their own ability and fighting style. The main characters use their wits and their own unique style to win. I liked Dragon Ball Z as much as the next kid growing up, but each characters strength is determined by their power level, and that's about it (DragonBall is a different). In HxH there is so much thought and strategy during the fights. When a character wins, you\n          \n        feel like they deserved it.\nThe characters are memorable and fun. If pressed I could name 10's of characters from this series. They are as unique as their abilities. Some shounen rely on the same types of characters you see over and over again (especially the villains). In HxH the villains are some of the best part, they are well thought out and entertaining to watch.\nThe story isn't groundbreaking, but done it's brilliantly. The overarching story is that Gon wants to find his father. However, like most ongoing manga, there are various story arcs. We see Gon mature and encounter various trials as he develops as a hunter and helps his friends.\nThe art is on and off. Having started the series over a decade ago, back in 2004ish, I've experienced the many writing hiatuses of Togashi. There are times when the art is wonderful, and fits the story beautifully. Other times, there are issues when it's clear the art isn't quite as strong. Personally, this was never a huge issue for me (the art, not the breaks). Any new chapter was better than no new chapter.\nSimply put, HxH is my jam. I've read the manga multiple times and watched more than one version of the anime. I've probably spent more time with Gon and Killua than I have with any other manga/anime characters. It is both a manga and anime (the 2011 version) that I can wholeheartedly recommend with no reservations.\nBe aware that this series, while for all intents and purposes is currently finished, isn't truly ended. Gon still has room to grow, and there are plenty of adventures for him to have. His journey as a hunter has just begun; his adventures with his friends only just started. I've had to realize that I might not get to read all of his adventures, and maybe I was foolish to think I could. I've waited with bated breath many a year for more HxH through the many hiatuses. But ultimately I've come to understand that mangakas are people too. Unlike a novel, manga span hundreds and hundreds of chapters that have to be both written and drawn. It's taken time, but I can look back on my HxX experience as a whole and have unabashed and total love for the series. Thank you Togashi, and thank you HxH.\n        "},

One most\n          \n        amazing things about this series is the author's sense of space. He puts in as much effort into creating the environment as he does developing the characters.

The worldbuilding is awful and just comes off as a bunch of ideas being thrown in at whim. \nThe fights before the Auction arc had no tension and the fights during the arc had no tension when everyone's useless against the Spiders except Killua who can only fight them because shounen bull.

I'll put it back here since it's practically the same with the exception that the manga has a horrible inconsistency with the drawing, as it does not have the animation, the music and the direction of the anime that it improves it in every aspect of the work, therefore I can call it bad and with all the errors that are loaded-\nI will talk only about the errors of the series .. Arc by Arc\n1)Hunter Exam.\nAlthough the beginning paints well and forms the friendship relations of which the main cast will be\n          \n        everything that consists of the examination itself is badly planned, to start all the characters do not seem to have empathic emotions with respect to everything that is happening in the same exam, nobody is unfazed or feels some fear corresponding to death, if I compare it with the whole cast that was raised and the situations in the Chunnin exam in Naruto this part HxH is too short, I could also talk about the end of the exam the hunter is hypocritical in the sense that they had raised this idea \"No matter what happens we will continue with the exam until the end\" but when they reach the tournament part in the end they complement it with \"You can not kill the opponent\" here everything goes relatively \"Good\" but when Killua kills the opponent they send everything to take for ass and approve the others in such a simple way, all the effort of the people who died to love complete the exam they sent him to take for ass for that detail.\n2) Tower of Heaven\nA whole arc where Killua and Gon go in search of skills, their premise is their problem, because it is basically that, a focused arc only to start making \"Complex\" the fights and make the show \"Deep\", the arc entirely dense, not passable or entertaining, simply dense and tedious, the fights of that arc are worth nothing because Gon and Killua are entirely protected by the plot armor of the moment so you know that they will not lose or die, therefore there is NO RISK, that means \"boring\". The arc is entirely bad\n3)York City\nDecerebrate action with a protagonist Gary stu to summarize things ... Kurapika skips the rules of the Nen that were established a back arc, you can increase the powers as he wants, He has unlimited access to the whole bar of powers of Nen, does not have any reflection after killing Uvogin because he had previously established that from his point of view everything he does is correct, Togashi fills Kurapika with unlimited weapons and powers after taking all one to create such a complex system of powers ... Shit\n4) Greed Island\nThe tower of heaven made worse; This arc is basically canon filler, you can skip it and it will not change anything, just take care to know that \"Gon and Killua train their powers in a world of video games\" because from then on the villain is the worst of the series in general , the bomber is forced into this arc only to create \"drama and tension\" .. All this arc is the worst shit\n5) Quimera ants\nVery good the arc entirely, the whole series was prepared for this moment and it is excellent, it has its criticable things as the Asspull of the nuclear bomb of Netero or that eliminated all the development of Meruem giving it \"Amnesia\" only to lengthen the arc still more in a more insufferable way ..\n6)The elections\nThe arc totally shits the consequences of the chimera ants (Revive Gon), the idea of ​​Alukka was not so bad since it had rules but AGAIN togashi loves to fuck his own rules and makes Killua know the only way to get the wishes WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES ... To end the arc with Gon looking for his father in the world tree, Gin tells him the message of the work in general \"That what matters is the trip, not the final destination\" the message would have meaning if Gon had learned something in his trip through the whole series, but you know what? GON NEVER LEARNS ANYTHING, IS THE SAME START TO THE END ... With this proposed you can imply that everything that happened the series is a nonsense that even in its last moments can unite its history with coherence to the message of the work\n\nIn conclusion..\nThe work is anticlimactic, it breaks all its proposed ideas, the protagonist never learns anything, the work is worth only in a single arch of 6 principals, \nthe direction and the music make the anime mediocre even when the script entirely becomes bad.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVersion en Español\n-Habia hecho una review del anime hace tiempo.. La volvere a poner aqui ya que es practicamente lo mismo con la excepcion de que el manga tiene una horrible inconsistencia con el dibujo, al no tener la animacion, la musica y la direccion del anime que lo mejora en todo aspecto a la obra, por lo tanto puedo tacharla de mala ya con todos los errores que se carga-\nHablare únicamente de los errores de la serie.. Arco por arco\n1) Arco del examen del cazador.\nSi bien el inicio pinta bien y se forman las relaciones de amistad del que será el cast principal todo lo que consiste al examen mismo está mal planteado, para empezar todos los personajes ni parecen tener emociones empáticas con respecto a todo lo que está pasando en el mismo examen, nadie se inmuta o siente algún miedo correspondiente a la muerte, si lo comparo con el cast entero que se planteó y las situaciones en el examen Chunnin en Naruto se queda muy corto esta parte HxH, tambien podría hablar que el final del examen del cazador es hipócrita en el sentido de que ellos habían planteado esta idea \"No importa lo que pase seguiremos con el examen hasta el final\" pero cuando llegan a la parte del torneo en el final lo complementan con \"No se puede matar al oponente\" aquí va todo relativamente \"Bien\" pero cuando Killua mata al oponente mandan todo a tomar por culo y aprueban a los demás de forma tan sencilla, todo el esfuerzo de la gente que murió para querer a completar el examen lo mandaron a tomar por culo por ese detalle.\n2) Torre del Cielo\nTodo un arco donde Killua y Gon van en busca de conseguir habilidades, su premisa es su problema, porque es básicamente eso, un arco únicamente enfocado solo para empezar hacer \"Complejas\" las peleas y hacer que el show sea \"Profundo\", el arco enteramente es denso, no es pasable ni entretenido, simplemente denso y tedioso, las peleas de ese arco no valen nada la pena por que Gon y Killua están enteramente protegidos por el plot armor del momento asi que sabes que ni van a perder o morir, por lo tanto NO HAY RIESGO, eso significa que \"Aburrido\". El arco enteramente es malo\n3) York City\nAccion descerebrada con un protagonista Gary stu para resumir las cosas… Kurapika se salta las reglas del Nen que se establecieron un arco atrás, se puede aumentar los poderes como él quiera, Tiene acceso ilimitado a toda la barra de poderes de Nen, no tiene alguna reflexión luego de matar a Uvogin porque desde antes se había establecido que desde su punto de vista todo lo que hace es correcto, Togashi llena a Kurapika de armas y poderes ilimitados luego de tardar todo un para crear un sistema tan complejo de poderes... Mierda\n4) Greed Island\nLa torre del cielo hecho peor; Este arco es básicamente relleno canon, te lo puedes saltar y no va a cambiar nada, solo ocupas saber que \"Gon y Killua entrenan sus poderes en un mundo de videojuegos\" porque de ahí en mas el villano es lo peor de la serie en general, el bombardero esta metido forzadamente en este arco solo para crear \"drama y tension\".. Todo este arco es mierda de la peor\n5) Hormigas Quimera\nMuy bueno el arco enteramente, toda la serie se preparo para este momento y quedo excelente, tiene sus cosas criticable como el Asspull de la bomba nuclear de Netero o de que eliminaron todo el desarrollo de Meruem dándole \"Amnesia\" solo para alargar el arco aun mas de forma mas insufrible.. \n6) Las elecciones\nEl arco caga totalmente las consecuencias de las hormigas quimera (Revivir a Gon), la idea de Alukka no estaba tan mal ya que tenia reglas pero OTRA VEZ togashi le encanta mandar a la mierda sus propias reglas y hace que Killua conozca la única forma de conseguir los deseos SIN CONSECUENCIAS... Para finalizar el arco con Gon buscando a su padre en el árbol mundial, Gin le comenta el mensaje de la obra en general \"Que lo que importa es el viaje, no el destino final\" el mensaje tendría sentido si Gon hubiera aprendido algo en su viaje por toda la serie ¿Pero saben que? GON NUNCA APRENDE NADA, ES EL MISMO DE INICIO HASTA EL FINAL…Con esto propuesto puedes dar a entender que todo lo que paso la serie es un sin sentido que ni siquiera en sus últimos momentos puede unir su historia con coherencia para el mensaje de la obra\nEn conclusión..\nLa obra es anticlimática, rompe todas sus ideas propuestas, el protagonista jamas aprende nada, la obra solo vale la pena en un único arco de 6 principales, la dirección y la música hacen al anime mediocre aun cuando el guion enteramente llega a ser mala..\n        "},

Most long shounens seem to be based mostly around a unique setting or concept that will make it easily stand out and hopefully sell, with little thought given to the long-term story development.\nHxH feels like a more planned out story, it's different (although it does have some very good worldbuilding). Each arc is based in a different location with it's own self-contained storyline that still serves to the overall narrative of the main characters (each has their own personal motivation). The arcs themselves switch\n          \n        between genres and characters to keep things fresh and even the main protagonist Gon is just a minor character in some arcs. The series plays around with many shounen tropes, doing them much better justice than in most other series. The characters are very well developed and the fights are mostly tactical, it avoids most of the shortfalls a long running shounen can be exposed to. \n The main flaws in the series include the art, which is lacking in many panels and some asspull moments. HxH doesn't totally escape the shounen traps, there are some dead characters who come back to life when they really shouldn't, a couple of fights are won with nakama power etc luckily these events are not very frequent. Those defincencies aside it's one of the best shounen series around, action, drama, psychological thrills, great worldbuilding and characters HxH has it all. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="               \n    this is just the best\nperfect story with every kind of feelings inside, based on friendship like all other animes but this is just best of them\nthe thing that seperates this anime/manga from others is, hxh is so intense has no useless stuff in it and has great 1v1 battles, not just based on 2 kids, there are so many great characters and they all have their own great stories\nand most of all the best thing is the improvement of people, for example they dont just get evolved in no time, they need to train so hard and get their result.\nand probably the only bad thing\n          \n        is togashi's illness :(\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="           \n    Hunter x Hunter has incredible character development. It can be divided into roughly 5 arcs, all which span several volumes and are carefully crafted so as to not leave any holes in the plot. You will rarely be wondering how something is possible, as the author covers every possible ground to make what is happening on the pages coherent. Battles are won through cunning over strength, and many great characters will either die or be left by the wayside when their time comes, giving you the sense of impermeability with the characters one has grown fond of. Hunter x Hunter has the action of a\n          \n        Shonen but has the plot and text on par with a great psychological Sienen. The story only receives an 8 from me because the last arc, which is on hiatus i believe, is sloppily drawn, and honestly would be hard to top considering the magnitude of the arc before it. The art is loose at times but is more than made up for by the fabulous text. The character development is so strong that one will know what the characters are feeling before they even feel it, and it gives the reader a strong sense of attachment. If there is one manga I come back to over and over, it this one. The plot is so well done that one could pick a any volume in the series and immediately be taken in.\n        "},
