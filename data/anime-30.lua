		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=1589, ["text"]="                          \n    Since so many people have requested this over the years and as there's a new system in place I'm adding my 2009 review for this series which was originally posted on my blog here on MAL. The 2007 one was written in response to the obtuse fans that were here at the time, and it will remain after the review as removing it completely would serve no purpose.\nIt's also a reminder to me of something important.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most debated animes in history. Some would argue that there are numerous hidden messages in the show, while others argue that it simply\n          \n        plays up to a certain puerile idealogy of the world. Whatever the case may be, NGE established itself as the hot topic in anime for well over a decade.\nNGE first saw the light of day as a manga by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, and was published in Shonen Ace magazine from February 1994. It's purpose was to raise awareness and public interest in the anime version that was to be released in October of the following year.\nThe anime was directed by the famous Hideaki Anno, and is hailed by many fans as his masterpiece (although there are numerous people who disagree with this point of view).\nAnimation\nThe animation in NGE is actually very well done considering the time it was made (and the fact that Gainax was running out of cash). The colour palette used for the show was decidely bright in many ways, and at the time it contrasted well with the serious tone of the story.\nThe characters were well designed for the most part, but the real breakthrough in terms of design were the EVA units and the Angels. NGE pushed the boundaries of mecha design in anime to a new level, something which no other show of the time could achieve. It also wasn't afraid to show an enemy who had no visible relation to humans - something that was a rarity in those days (although Anno had used a similar technique in Top wo Nerae).\nThe animation in the show is generally very fluid, and although there are some notable flaws, they don't actually impede on the enjoyment of the show.\nSound\nThe sound in NGE is very good in general. The VAs in the japanese version are very good, and are able to deliver a greater depth of emotion than their american counterparts. The effects used are also quite good but never really stood out as much, partly because of the overwhelming visuals, and partly because they were generally stock effects. The music is generally good throughout the show, with a mixture of classical and other styles scattered here and there.\nOne of the most memorable things about the music in NGE is the theme tune. Anno had originally wanted to use Borodin's Polovetsian Dances as the theme music for each episode, but was overruled by TV Tokyo, who felt that this would confuse and alienate the audience. Instead he settled on what has become one of the most played anime theme tunes in history - A Cruel Angel's Thesis, which was performed by Takahashi Yoko.\nCharacters\nThis is the area where NGE failed as an anime. Prior to making NGE, Hideaki Anno had suffered from depression for a while, and the characters in NGE were created in such a manner as to reflect his struggle against mental illness. Each of the characters is flawed in different ways, something that was unusual in anime at the time. Given Anno's talent as a director, this should have led to some interesting, and highly original, character development. Unfortunately the show failed in this area because of one key factor - Ikari Shinji.\nFor many people like myself, the main issue we have with the show isn't the story, or the animation, or the sound. It's the characters, and in particular, Ikari Shinji. In creating him, Anno and the rest of the production team lost focus on the other characters. Shinji is not your typical hero in that he isn't, courageous, or handsome, or intelligent. In fact, Shinji consider's himself to be worthless. The issue I have is that the show focuses far too much on Shinji, almost to the extent where the other characters were simply plot devices for his devlopment, and not enough on the characters around him.\nThat's not to say Shinji is a bad character. He's not. The problem is that one can only stomach so much unjustified self pity (which unfortunately most of it was in his case), before wanting to slap some sense into the person in question. It's been pointed out to me that Shinji wanted to kill himself because he thought he was worthless, and that he should be pitied because of the bad hand he was dealt. I'm sorry but that argument doesn't wash with me. If someone truly wants to kill themselves then they will, so Shinji didn't really want to die. In addition to that, I know quite a few people who have been dealt the worst hands possible, yet they do not whine and complain about it (and many of these people did consider themselves to be useless/worthless at one time or another - yet they suffered in silence for the most part). What Shinji wanted was for people to pity him and tell him he wasn't worthless, and while this is not necessarily a bad thing, it was over-used in NGE (to the point where I wanted to put him out of his misery - and not because I pitied him). The fact that Shinji's character has a tendency to ram his sense of worthlessness into the faces of the other characters is what put me off, as that type of behaviour is usually for attention rather than a cry for help, and because of the show's focus on Shinji, you can imagine how much I wanted to hit him afterwards. It wasn't that I didn't understand, it was just that they failed to depict him as an object of pity, and instead he came across as a whining, self pitying, attention seeking, and generally loathesome person.\nAs for the other characters, in particular Rei and Asuka, they did get a certain amount of development throughout the series. Unfortunately though, their characters, as well as the rest of the cast, were overshadowed by the mammoth amount of development given to Shinji.\nStory\nI actually quite enjoyed the concept behind NGE, as it made a nice change of pace. I did, however, have some issues with the convenient deus ex machina of Unit 01, as well as a number of other \"coincidences\" that were scattered throughout the series.\nThe story itself isn't all that original, and it has clearly borrowed elements from other sci-fi stories. What made the story seem to be original was the inclusion of psuedo-religious and psuedo-philosophical concepts, as well as the inclusion of \"Fruedian\" psychology. These formed core elements of the story, so what would have been a standard \"save the earth\" scenario became a dive into the psyche of the characters. The basic plot is borrowed directly from Space Battleship Yamamoto, and the idea of \"young\" people protecting the earth was used by Anno himself in Top wo Nerae.\nUnfortunately the story breaks down in several places. Anno tried to make a show that merged all perspectives into one single view, and while he managed to achieve this in some measure, he failed because he focused too much on Shinji, to the extent that no other options were ever considered.\nHere's what I mean. NERV is a quasi militaristic outfit, and as such, would generally have backup options available to them. The convenient deus ex machina I mentioned earlier effectively removes all chance for anyone else to come to the fore - except for Shinji that is. If the viewer is to believe that an organisation such as NERV was supposed to protect the earth, then they would at the very least, look for other options, especially considering Shinji's character flaws. This would effectively mean that they would have at least some combat veterans or trained soldiers who could handle the EVA units. The use of teenagers as the leads in the show was simply so that it would appeal to the teenage audience.\nAnother area where the story breaks down is in it's use of religious symbology. Many fans believe that what is shown in NGE is taken directly from religious beliefs, in particular Kabbalism, Judaism and Christianity. While the names used in the show may be true to those religions though, in many cases the manner in which the reference is used is actually based on Anno's own definition, rather than the religious viewpoint (something for which Anno has been heavily criticised).\nIn truth, The religious symbology used in the show was only really used to give the series an edge over other \"giant robot\" anime (i.e. Macross, Gundam, etc), and all of the various interpretations since have been ascribed to it by the viewers rather than the creators (something which is very well documented).\nOne big plot hole that I noticed, and one that should have been obvious to most people as well, was Shinji's isolationist attitude, and Gendou's reaction to it. It's obvious to any who've watched the series that Gendou feels little sympathy towards Shinji, however due to that convenient plot device using Unit 01 I mentioned earlier, Gendou needs Shinji to pilot the EVA unit. So, what you effectively have is the leader of a militaristic organisation who feels little for others, and a teenager with supposed mental instabilities. This being the case, why wasn't Gendou forcibly dosing Shinji with meds to make him more compliant? If your purpose is to protect the earth and it's people from attack by extremely powerful beings, and you're basically a selfish person with your own agenda, then conscience or paternal instincts don't come into it, you simply do what's necessary, no matter what anyone else says.\nIt's interesting that the whole \"psychology\" angle is only really supposed to apply to Shinji, isn't it? Characters like Gendou have been \"toned down\" because their actions would have drawn too much attention to themselves, another convenient plot device.\nEnjoyment\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is a tough show to rate. According to Anno, if you're a normal, well rounded person then you won't learn anything from the show. While this may be true in some cases, the things that one can learn from the show are juvenile at best. Many of the older fans of NGE have a tendency to view the show through the rose tinted lenses of nostalgia, and while this is not a bad thing, it inhibits the ability to view the show objectively. Many of the younger fans, on the other hand, are fiercely loyal to the show, and have a tendency to react harshly to any criticism of the show. The unfortunate side effect of this is that the show has gained a certain notoriety that it could have done without, and many people who watch the show for the first time, do so with certain preconceived notions already embedded in their heads.\nNGE is one of those shows that could have been great. Unfortunately the glaring flaws in the plot, coupled with the lack of develpment amongst the other characters in comparison to Shinji meant that I, at least, only found the show to be mediocre. NGE was a let down for me as I am a big fan of Top wo Nerae, the show that is effectively the older sibling to NGE (and is considered by quite a few people to be the superior show).\nI'm not going to suggest anyone watches the show, as that is a decision you should make for yourself. Likewise the choice of whether you love it or hate it is something that only you can decide. The only thing I can say about the show is that, when watching it, be as objective as you can.\nNGE is no Top wo Nerae by any measure, but it is a classic. Unfortunately, it really isn't Anno's best work, and the rebuild is making the same errors all over again. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd here's the review that originally graced this page. It's a bit bilious and lowbrow, but it served it's purpose - which contrary to what you may think wasn't to simply to upset the \"hardcore\" fans.\nOkay, I'm REALLY going to upset a lot of you out there with this review.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most mediocre animes I have EVER seen.\nI watched this when it first came out, and I wasn't overly impressed with it to say the least.\nThe story is okay. The idea of earth being assaulted by unknown, quasi-supernatural/technological beings is one that has been handed down through the years, the most famous example being The War of the Worlds (which wins hands down by the way).\nThe animation was actually one of the few plus points for this anime. The art style and use of colour made this attractive to many when it was first released. The sound was also of a high standard, and the catchy J-pop intro jingle was forcibly lodged into many peoples craniums.\nNow we get to the good part - the characters.\nAyanami Rei was okay as a character, but what on earth possesses everyone to raise Ikari Shinji to almost godlike status? The guy is biggest loser in anime (with the exception of Makoto for School Days - Nice Boat), and one of the biggest losers I have even seen in ANY story since Thomas Covenant. I honestly found myself wishing he was a real person so I could smack some sense into him. I've heard it mentioned that he is the most realistic character in the anime, and I have to wonder what planet the people who say such things were born on. I mean honestly.\nOkay, rant over, here's why this character is THE MAIN REASON why this anime was mediocre. NERV is a military organisation whose SOLE objective is the protection of the planet, by whatever means. This being the case, WHY THE HELL is Ikari Shinji the main focus of the story? He doesn't want to pilot an EVA, and doesn't want to fight. Any self respecting organisation WOULD HAVE FOUND SOMEONE MORE WILLING AND MORE ABLE to do the job. There's such a fuss over how special Shinji is, but surely with 6 billion people on the planet there would be someone better equipped for the job.\nBut I understand the anime only had so much budget so they couldn't really conduct a global search.\nThe most believable character is Asuka Langley Soryu, as her reaction to Shinji's ineptitude and cowardice is similar to that of any reasonable person.\nI'm not going to mention enjoyment as I've already made it clear that this was mediocre at best.\nThis wasn't Hideaki Anno's best work by far. Top wo Nerae (Gunbuster), was a far superior sci-fi anime, and the characters were MUCH more believable. The story for Top wo Nerae beats Neon Genesis Evangelion hands down.\nAs for his other works, watch Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou (KareKano or His & Her Circumstances). Hideaki Anno proved his talent with this anime, and Top wo Nerae, so I can only assume he was suffering from dementia when Evangelion was written.\nA suggestion if I may, to end this rant. If you want emotion, trauma, passion, a great story, and all the rest, then watch some of the following animes:\nFullmetal Alchemist\nBarefoot Gen\nFlanders no Inu (movie)\nFull Metal Panic: The Second Raid\nNHK ni Youkoso!\nKareshi Kanojo no Jijou\nTop wo Nerae\nGrave of the Fireflies\nMushishi\nChrno Crusade\nThere's a lot more that fit the bill. Watch them, then re-watch evangelion and see if it has the same feeling it did before (I would advise removal of the fluffy pink clouds of nostalgia in your head before rewatching).\nSome of you are probably wondering why I wrote this review if I dislike the show so much. The reason is simple. I'm sick to death of seeing the show aired on the various channels that show anime, and I'm even more fed up with the fact that newcomers to anime are indoctrinated by magazines and other people into liking this piece of tripe, especially when there are far superior animes out there that rarely get mentioned anywhere.\nI'm going to end this review here. I'm not going to tell you all not to watch this. I just hope that this review makes you consider what actually IS good in anime.\nI hope I haven't upset you all too much.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1188, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Note: this review is spoiler free.\nHugely experimental and wonderfully unique, Evangelion is a roaring success.\nThe basic, initial, plot goes thus: a 14-year-old boy named Shinji is called to NERV (an organization charged with defending mankind from extinction, no less) by his estranged, seemingly cold and calculating father. There, his fathers' first words are an order to pilot an immense robotic machine, the titular Evangelion, and fight against the monster that's attacking Tokyo-3, the city under which NERV has it's headquarters. These illusory 'monsters' are called Angels and are seemingly invincible - traditional weaponry, even in the year 2015, has minimal effect upon them. Only the\n          \n        Eva 'biomechs', which can be piloted solely by certain selected 14-year-olds can stop them. This [i]is[/i] merely the basic, initial premise of the series. As it goes on, everything gets a lot more complicated;  There's a metric ton of mystery, suspense, twists and turns in Evangelion's plot, all routinely thought-provoking and intensely interesting.\nThe characters are excellent. This is an important point as the series is more about them than about the Angels or NERV. Shinji Ikari is one the most believable and genuinely sympathetic character ever conceived in anime. Though some would complain that Shinji is overtly emotional and annoyingly so. But, really, no one wants Shinji to become the 'Hollywood hero' and save the day with a smile on his face - no such human could ever really exist, and studio Gainax understand this and apply it perfectly to the series. Shinji's mental struggle is dealt with effectively by Hideki Anno, through the use of complex monologues and largely successful experimental cinematic techniques. Asuka and Rei, the other chosen children, are both polar opposites and ingenious characters. Both develop a great deal in a very interesting way throughout the series, and this character exploration and growth is at the heart of Evangelion.\nThe design aspects are wonderfully unique - the Evas themselves are strikingly colourful and the Angels are attention grabbing and memorable with many towering over Tokyo-3's skyscraper. The Angels appear in many different forms (one Angel takes the form of a gargantuan, blue diamond while another is too small to be seen with the naked eye and acts as an organic virus, crippling NERV's computer system) which helps Eva avoid the repetitve \"Monster of the Week\" format and keeps the action aspect of the series consistently fresh and enjoyable. Judeo-Christian references are famous (or rather, infamous) in Evangelion and despite widespread condemnation, I am of the firm belief that the symbolism is never obnoxious, and always evocative and visually shocking. It must be noted these references are usually fairly shallow, but they make you sit up and take notice of the deeper meaning in the series as a whole. Animation is crisp and clear for the platinum re-mastering that I watched, and I hasten to add that this re-mastering is only version of Eva worth buying. Visuals are regularly stunning and scenes from this series will surely stay with you forever. The regular provocative imagery is often times shocking and sometimes awe-inspiring. The image of a crippled Rei, bleeding and covered in bandages in the first episode provides the first real shock of the series. Such imagery contrasts with the visual gags present throughout - a toothpick container obscuring Shinji's nether regions in episode 2 being one of the most memorable.\nThe music is, much like the rest of Eva, superbly memorable. It excels at setting the right mood and tone, using inspirational trumpets to highlight Asuka and Shinji's success in battle, and nuanced reflective tunes to convey the character of Rei. The OP is among my favourites of all time and you'll not tire of hearing it throughout the 26 episodes of the series.\nThe final two episodes are controversial (more controversial than the rest of the series at least!) because they are both the peak of experimental Eva. While I certainly wouldn't call them \"bad\", they are frustratingly unsatisfying as an ending. Thankfully, the subsequent movie release titled 'End of Evangelion' rectifies this with bombastic aplomb. EoE - which essentially tells the story of what happens in eps. 25 and 26, but this time outside of Shinji's mind - is truly magnificent, and definitely lives up to the sky high standards set in the series, and perhaps even exceeds them. As well as being one of the greatest anime movies ever made, EoE gives the series an extraordinary conclusion.\nI haven't even mentioned the dub, the pacing or the sound effects, but rest assured that they are all of a fantastic standard. Overall, I think this series deserves it's iconic status - it's easily one of the absolute best TV series (anime or otherwise) that I've ever seen. Every single episode is nothing less than a masterpiece and an utter joy to watch. I whole heartedly recommend Neon Genesis Evangelion. It is imperative that you watch this anime!"},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=465,  ["text"]="                          \n    People have been fighting over the merits of Neon Genesis Evangelion since its conception, engaging in an endless bloody war to decide whether or not the series is a masterpiece or overly-pretentious filth. Writing a review for Evangelion is pretty much just adding fuel to the fire, giving one side or another some extra ammo with which to demolish the opinions of the opposition. For that reason, I've decided to do something different with my Evangelion review. I'm actually going to write two reviews, one heralding Evangelion as a masterpiece and the other condemning it as mediocre bilge. I've put my full effort into both\n          \n        of them, trying to make each compelling. I believe that both reviews get down to the essence of why people either love or hate the show, and the goal is to let anyone pondering whether they should pick up this giant of the medium to really understand what they're getting into and whether or not it sounds appealing to them.\nWithout further ado, I present Neon Genesis Evangelion: Critic & Fanboy.\n**The following review will explain why Neon Genesis Evangelion is overrated garbage.**\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most popular anime of all time. It's shaped the entire medium for decades, inspiring countless other shows through its characters, story, and ideas. Many people have called it the \"greatest anime ever made\" and a \"triumph\". Its protagonist, Shiji Ikari, has been on the top of many character lists, and its ending is infamous. Most times when someone starts criticizing Evangelion they are promptly told that they just \"don't understand what it's trying to achieve\". Well, let me begin by saying this: I understand exactly what Evangelion was trying to achieve, I just think that it executes this attempt very poorly. Evangelion is a mecha show, yes, but it's really about the internal struggles of the characters: most noticeably depression, fear of rejection, and sense of self. It's attempting to criticize the anime crowd by telling them that they're filling their lives with hollow escapism as a substitute for meaningful human interaction, but it's also just trying to tell people in general that they have value as an individual and whatnot. But before we get into how it fails in this regard, let's talk about the more superficial stuff. Let's talk about the plot.\nSee, Evangelion seems to have the idea that if it's \"meaningful\" enough it doesn't matter if it doesn't have a well put-together story. If it discusses important ideas, its story can be a mess. Well, half of this is true: the story IS a mess. The premise assumes that only 14-year-old children can pilot giant robots. Why? Never touched on. Okay, so any 14-year-old in the world will do, right? Nope, it has to be the guy who's spearheading the whole project's son, who is also conveniently unwilling to do it. Why not find someone more willing and trained? Well, because his synchronization rates are off the charts, of course. Sounds like an awful lot of insanely contrived nonsense to me. To top it off, Shinji's dad hates him to make sure he has issues with opening up, although this is never explained either. It seems like if the fate of the world was going to be entrusted to my son, I would want to, you know, make sure he was emotionally stable even if I didn't like him. After setting off this ridiculous premise the show devolves into bland monster-of-the-week with minimal development for about half of its run, throws in some totally meaningless religious symbolism, bends the world around Shinji's problems more than SAO bends around Kirito, and then proceeds to turn all of its characters into tools for its single-minded purpose before ending with a slideshow of photographs of lamps and concept art with dialogue over top.\nSee, here's the thing. If I wanted someone to explain to me the philosophy behind the hedgehog's dilemma or to tell me that I needed to open up to other human beings, I could just consult wikepedia or go see a therapist. The reason I'm watching a TV show instead is because by using a story with elements that get me invested and characters that I can relate to it allows me to understand what I could have learned at face-value anywhere. I learn because I care. Evangelion, however, forgets this. It seems to think that if it just spews enough philosophy at the viewer that that will do the trick. Why should I care what the show is telling me? Because here's the thing: the ending isn't gibberish. It does mean something, it means something very specific. But it still fails completely because it fails to convey that in a way that engages the audience or demonstrates it through the use of a story. It abandons the story and gets all up in your face instead, and this ruins the impact and renders everything its saying unimportant.\nWell then, what does the show accomplish? Sure, it has some nice action sequences, but these come at the expense of a lack of budget later in the show. The soundtrack is pretty standard, with some of the pieces even being pretty blatant ripoffs from other places (one person once showed me how one of the battle themes is nigh identical to a 007 song), and all we're really left with to convey what the show is trying to convey is the characters.\nThe characters from Evangelion get a lot of praise. Many consider them to be the greatest cast of all time. Shinji Ikari, wonder boy, has been tugged around as the epitome of male protagonists, and others like Asuka and Rei laid down the foundations for their archetypes. Let's talk about all three, one at a time.\nRei - Rei is a failed experiment. She was originally created by Anno (the director) as a way to demonstrate to the Otaku fanbase that their best girls and waifus were actually just emotionless unresponsive dolls that would never provide them with anything real. The sentiment is one thing, but the fact of the matter is it doesn't matter what Anno wanted to convey, what matters is the result of what he created. Rei actually became the very thing she was created to destroy, and was one of the most popular waifus ever made. She reinforced the idea she was meant to take down. Rei is an absolute disaster.\nAsuka - Asuka is very nearly the origin of the tsundere. The trope may have existed before her, but she defined it and made it popular. The problem is, Asuka really isn't that well-written. It doesn't matter what ideas she was used to expressed, the fact of the matter is that the consistency of her character is weak and by the end she, along with many other characters, has been converted into a tool to be used by Anno to make his points. She ceases to feel like a person of her own, and exists only to reinforce the ideas conveyed by Shinji.\nShinji - The man himself, attacking Shinji's character is considered pretty taboo. However, in truth, Shinji is simply pretty mediocre. His character exists to repeat the same few ideas over and over ad naseum, and he receives very little characterization outside of this. By the end of the show almost everything we know about Shinji can be boiled down to \"he's afraid of rejection\", \"he has daddy issues\" and \"he struggles with self-value and sense of self\". While this is great and all, there's more to people than just their deep-seated issues and Shinji fails to display that.\nSo with all this in mind, what on earth sets Evangelion apart? What has kept the fanbase so alive and vocal for these twenty years while nearly everything else made around the same time has fallen into obscurity? I believe the answer is pretty simple: intensity. The ideas in Evangelion aren't unique. They're in plenty of other anime, portrayed in more well-developed and creative ways, but Evangelion drowns all of those out by being really goddamn loud about what it's saying. Its characters are screaming, crazed people. Its production is a wildly fluctuating mess. Its emotional intensity is unmatched, and it uses this to grab peoples attention and cause them to feel as if it is \"raw\" or \"real\" when really it's just very noisy. Neon Genesis Evangelion may be one of a kind, but that doesn't mean that it's some sort of incomprehensible masterpiece. It just means that its a broken, twisted thing that takes some pretty straightforward ideas and yells them until people pay attention, rarely managing to convey them in any powerful way. It's preachy, poorly-constructed, and will hopefully gradually fade into obscurity so that people stop having to feel as though they're obliged to watch it only to be told that they don't \"get\" it.\n**And on the flip side, the following will explain why Neon Genesis Evangelion is an inspirational masterpiece, worthy of standing the test of time.**\nNeon Genesis Evangelion: the words that can spark conflict amongst anime fans almost instantaneously, like pouring water on sodium. Many people believe that this medium giant is overrated, outdated, or simply not a very good show. Some people even deeply loathe it, frustrated with its convoluted presentation and rabid fanbase. Personally, however, the show is one of my favorites. I believe it continues to be relevant for a reason. I believe that Neon Genesis Evangelion has achieved what no show before or after it has managed, and perhaps what no visual medium has ever accomplished.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion manages to truly capture the feelings of doubt, isolation, existential dread, and desire for human connection that come with being alive. It manages to express them in a way that is powerful enough to replicate the monumental weight that these matters place on us, and it manages to provide a simply, bittersweet yet beautiful answer to them.\nThe first thing you should know about Evangelion is that at face-value it isn't perfect. It has pacing issues, budget issues, and cracks in its plot that plague it all throughout its run. It seems to change moods quickly in its first half, and it doesn't always seem to care about all of the threads of its creation. However, I firmly believe that a polished version of the show would not be as effective. It's because it's so messy that it manages to draw you in. That messiness is relatable. The world is a confusing, difficult place, and so is Evangelion. Likewise, as it progresses into its second half and the internal struggles of its beautifully-crafted characters begin to swell up inside them and consume them, the show shifts its focus to accommodate this because that's what it feels like to the characters. The internal battles they are fighting are all-consuming things, far more important than what is happening at NERV headquarters, and the show demonstrates this by allowing the inner workings of their minds to consume the show itself and show you first-hand how much this matters to them.\nThe entire show manages this, actually. It takes such simple internal yet universal conundrums and inflates the scale of them, making them feel larger than life in the forms of giant, gruesome robots and bizarre alien beings. The plot becomes insane and messy, with schemes and scale intensifying constantly to keep up with the messiness of the character's minds. Evangelion takes these all-important ideas and it shows that, using its rather cliched premise to demonstrate that it understands just how huge these issues feel to people. It does this in a way that nothing else does, drilling down to the cores of its characters and its audience and digging up the things that seep poison into their hearts. Evangelion lays people bare, it strips them down, it shows them that it understands them and then it tells them what they can do.\nBy people, of course, I mean both the audience and the characters, but since I can't give you an analysis of the audience allow me to take a moment to talk about the characters. There are three central characters that make up the cast, playing off each other perfectly: Rei Ayanami, Asuka Langely, and Shinji Ikari. Each of them serves a distinct purpose in the narrative and I want to take some time to talk about each of them.\nRei - Rei is the doll character, a stoic figure lacking emotions that has been repeated over and over again since her conception in all manner of shows. In Evangelion, however, she serves a very specific purpose. Rei demonstrates to Shinji what he is. Because she's a doll, she responds in whatever way she is treated, and showing her kindness will elicit kindness in return. Essentially, she is a mold-able personality, a person that will be whatever you want them to be for you. Through Shinji's interactions with her she demonstrates both that the concept of such a being (oftentimes taking the form of a significant other from a TV show in our world) is disgusting, and that Shinji will not be able to find the sense of acceptance and connection that he desires from her. She's not accepting Shinji because of who he is, she's accepting him because she'll accept anyone.\nAsuka - Asuka is practically the origin of the modern tsundere archetype, with the unfortunately truth being that it's an archetype that was mastered at its conception and has not been challenged since. Asuka provides two very important facets to the series: firstly, she's a character to foil Shinji and reject him. She's a very distinct personality of her own, and her coldness towards Shinji stems from who he is. Shinji is forced to confront the harsh reality that if he opens up to her she will likely hurt him, and has to decide whether that is worth it regardless. On the other hand, Asuka is an amazing character in her own right. She struggles with many of the central themes of the series herself, loathing herself for not being good enough and trying to discover who she is when the aspects that she decided defined her come crumbling down.\nShinji - I've already mentioned him a hundred times in this review, but here he is: Shinji Ikari, the naked heart of the human race. Shinji pretty much is Evangelion, and most if not all of the show's messages are conveyed through him. Over the course of the show he becomes more and more withdrawn into his own mind, struggling to come out of his closely-guarded heart and actually express himself to the world. He wants to be wanted for who he is, not because he's useful, or because he's any person. He wants to be cared for because he's himself, because he's an individual, because of what makes him him. It's something that every human on this planet desires, and no one demonstrates it better than Shinji Ikari.\nAs the show culminates into a surreal journey into the minds of the characters, some people complain about the convoluted nature of the execution or that the ending of the show is only pretending to be meaningful. I assure you this is not the case. It may be jarring, yes, but if you pay attention you'll find that you're observing the most important decision in the world being made. All of the literal world falls away, because in comparison to what is going on inside the minds of our protagonists such a world is unimportant. That is the world through which one can express one's self, but Evangelion is more concerned with what is one's self. Evangelion is concerned with what makes you you and me me, and why the two of us talking and conveying our thoughts and becoming closer is the most important thing in the world, not in spite of the fact that we can never truly know each other but because of it. It's an infinitely important idea, and Neon Genesis Evangelion takes it on like no other.\nIf you haven't seen this masterpiece yet, I can only urge you to watch it. After all, you are a person, and Evangelion is about people. It knows them. It understands them on a level that nothing else does. It draws you in with its gritty, alluring story full of mysteries and its utterly unique mecha designs, it captivates you with its constantly creative enemies and lucrative fighting techniques, and then it shows you what it means to be human. It's one of a kind, and I can't encourage you enough to give it a try.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=580,  ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Evangelion is widely considered one of the most influential anime created in the 1990's, if not of all time. It is extremely well known for it's brave attempts to turn the mecha genre on it's head, it's deep character development, and it's unorthodox storyline. Created by acclaimed studio Gainax, and written by both praised (and sometimes hated) writer Hideaki Anno, Evangelion has been called a masterpiece by anime fans. Does it deserve this praise.\nSimply, yes.\nStory: One of the most well known aspects of Evangelion is it's story; it is simply unorthodox, as it does the process of not feeding all of the story the viewer;\n          \n        it drip-feeds it, giving the viewer only half the story, or sometimes giving scenes without any context. For some anime, this would be a disaster waiting to happen, but in the case of Evangelion, this is done almost consistently masterfully, holding back information on such subjects such as SELEE or The Angels.  Many have critisized the holding of frames later in the series, but taken into the context of the fact they were running out of money to make the show, is is understandable. \nFor many fans, their major criticism of the anime is the handling of the ending, which many consider far too 'out there' and simply crap. I too, am not a huge fan of the ending, but taking the ending to the TV series, inside the context of the 'true' ending movie, The End of Evangelion, the ending can make a lot more sense, and thus I enjoy it far, far more. To stop me from ranting on for ages, Evangelion's story is a master stroke in writing, one which has been a hard feat to replicate.\nArt and Sound: I was introduced to Evangelion through the in-progress tetraology of films, The Rebuild of Evangelion; due to this, I became used to the cutting edge graphics employed for the higher-budget films. And to be honest, yes, the TV series art is beginning to show it's age 20 years on; however, this does not detract from the series in any major capcity, as the art compliments the anime extremely well.\nThe sound is also fantastic, and a very high-point for the show. Excellent music is employed to showcase the fights against the Angels, and for darker moments such as the internal struggles of the main cast of the show. Some of Beethoven's music is featured later in the series, which coupled with the emotional impact of the scene, produces one of the most excellent scenes in anime history.\nCharacters: By a massive leap, the highlight of the series. Evangelion features in it's story the struggles of the main characters, to devastatingly wonderful effect. Weak, timid, daddy-issues Shinji, to powerful, arrogant, egotistical Asuka, to the quiet, mysterious Rei, and the dark, apparently agnostical Gendo, Evangelion develes into the mind and motivations of these characters, showcasing exactly what makes them tick, and this is what gives us some animes most regonisable and wonderful characters.\nI am certain entire essays have been written on why certain charcters tick, and that's another reason so many of these characters are so wonderful. Fans are so devoted to their favorite characters (personally I am partial to Rei and Gendo), and this creates a wonderful feeling when learning about these characters and then discussing this with other fans. Generally, Evangelion employs some of the most human characters in anime, showing us that the heroes of anime aren't always strong, both mentally and physically, or not even in control of their lives.\nIn closing, Evangelion is one of the strongest anime ever produced. It employs powerful characters, a deep, deep story, and art that has only just began to show it's age. What makes the show's longevity even more powerful is that even now on sites such as EvaGeeks people are still analysing this series, trying to know everything about it. I hope Evangelion will live on in the hearts of it's fans, who'll continue to appreciate it's deep, metaphorical story. I hope that Evangelion will always remain an anime that will be treasured, for all the ages.\n"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=253,  ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion has been known to divide audiences. And despite its love for giant robot battles and generous use of fan service, Neon Genesis Evangelion is unarguably one... of the most influential sagas in modern anime. In the history of anime no series has sparked more debate than Evangelion. For every viewer who's enthralled by its mix of classic anime action, convoluted philosophy, psychological angst, and religious imagery, there's another who finds it pretentious and ponderous.\nIf you are unfamiliar with Neon Genesis Evangelion and have yet to watch it for the first time, you're in for a real treat it truly is an emotional\n          \n        roller coaster. On the surface, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a basic mecha series with a host of teenage pilots controlling monstrous beasts called Eva’s. The lead character is a reluctant hero trying to live up to his father's expectations while saving humanity at the same time.\nStory: The story of Evangelion primarily begins in 2000 with the \"Second Impact\", a global cataclysm which almost completely destroyed Antarctica and led to the deaths of half the human population of Earth. The Impact is believed by the public at large and even most of Nerv to have been the impact of a meteorite landing in Antarctica, causing devastating tsunamis and a change in the Earth's axial tilt (leading to global climate change) and subsequent geopolitical unrest, nuclear war (such as the nuking of Tokyo), and general economic distress. Later, Second Impact is revealed to be the result of contact with and experimentation on the first of what are collectively dubbed the Angels: Adam. The experiments were sponsored by the mysterious organization Seele, and carried out by the research organization Gehirn.\nIn the year 2010, Gehirn had accomplished a number of its scientific and engineering goals and corporately changed into the paramilitary organization Nerv which is headquartered in Tokyo-3, a militarized civilian city located on one of the last dry sections of Japan; Nerv's central mission is to locate the remaining Angels predicted by Seele, and to destroy them. However, Nerv has its own secret agenda, as directed by its Machiavellian commander Gendo Ikari: the Human Instrumentality Project, which, according to Gendo in episode 25, is the task of uniting all human minds into one global spiritual entity. Associated with Nerv is the Marduk Institute, which has the task of selecting the pilots for the Evas, the most capable being children conceived after the Second Impact (14 year olds). The institute consists of Commander Ikari, and Nerv's chief scientist Ritsuko Akagi; supporting the two are 108 companies which are all revealed to be ghost companies.\nStory does start off quick with a bit action in the beginning. It then becomes quite dull with how the main character acts. But by the time Asuka makes her first appearance, the show has kicked into high gear for a stunning run of near-perfect episodes.\nCharacters: The cast of Characters in NGE are varied, and through the course of the series the majority of them are emotionally ripped apart and left for dead. NGE holds back nothing. For most animes, a flaw of a character is usually ironed out before the end. But NGE is different. Weak characters show moments of strength, but ultimately remain weak. Arrogant characters show moments of humility but ultimately remain egotistical. Such is the nature of the series - the characters definitely go through challenging experiences that test their flaws, but they do not seem to overcome them. One reason for this may be that the challenges the characters go through in NGE are treated as though they were realistic stressful conditions that mentally damage the characters since there is always bad collateral damage even with success. \nArt & Animation: While the animation looks a bit dated by today's standards, NGE is still a powerful cerebral onslaught and an audiovisual force that won't soon be forgotten. \nThere are just so many things Evangelion does right that elevate it beyond pedestrian anime. The world is so alive and well-developed, right down to the smallest details (like the way cars run on batteries instead of gasoline, as one would expect in a future following global disaster that would limit access to fossil fuels). Even the minor characters, like classmates Toji and Kensuke, are remarkably fleshed out. The way Misato's mature (but dysfunctional) relationship with Kaji contrasts with the teens' awkward, tentative steps towards romance is brilliant. In other words, Evangelion pulls off the remarkable trick of feeling tantalizingly real, an exceedingly rare accomplishment in anime (and animation in general). \nSound: NGE is a show of extremes. Ranging from scenes of palpable, visceral power that inspire shock and awe, to the most quietly serene, surreal, and beautifully touching moments. These scenes are woven together as fine and eloquently as the Beethoven Symphony they play in episode 24 itself. And like that symphony, even though the parts are outstanding, the whole is much greater than the sum. \nEnjoyment: Without spoiling the show for those of you new to join, the replay/enjoyment value on this one is off the charts if you enjoy complex dramas and well written anime shows. Further, in the thirteen years this one has been out, you can trace almost every anime show using giant robots, psychological thrillers, and hidden cabals within society running things from behind the scenes back to this one. Sure, it builds on shows that came before it but it was more of a revolutionary step in terms of overall complexity and quality than it was a smaller evolutionary step; leading fans to discuss its nuances over and over.\nOverall: Evangelion is definitely in a class by itself, and it is required viewing for any anime fan. Not just another giant robot/sexy teenager anime, Evangelion is a trendsetter and a pillar of creative achievement. While it won't answer many of those lingering questions you might have in the end, it does set up the finale, End of Evangelion, a movie that presents a more coherent ending which makes a lot more sense than the last two episodes did. \nMake it a priority to watch this and see for yourself what NGE means to you. After you do, make sure you watch the movie, End of Evangelion.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=244,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    One of my absolute favorite things about this anime is how they have implemented lots of references to old religious symbols and characters; and how it's all done. They make the series into something more by doing this; it gives it a unique feel that I still haven't seen in other series. \nThe story itself is made up of pure awesomeness. It has a mix of mecha (which of course includes action), slight romance, and psychological elements, and especially the latter. It progresses nicely as the episodes pass, and we get to see more back stories, more psychological struggles, and lots of neat fighting. The\n          \n        thing that drags the story down is the two final episodes - they're very confusing. Though I'm able to understand many elements of the end now, when I watched this series half a year ago, I didn't get it at all.. Also, it had some strange moments toward the end, mainly the scenes where nothing at all happens for a minute (example: Asuka and Rei are standing in an elevator for nearly a minute, and the only thing that happens is a cough from one of them).\nThe characters of this show... well, to quote Hideaki Anno - 'It's strange that Evangelion has become such a hit - all the characters are so sick!' That's true, very true. But they are sick in a way which makes me like them, because they are portrayed in such an excellent way. The characters have really deep emotional struggles, and the way the series portray this makes them seem to me like actual human beings; I end up sympathizing with them and their tragic pasts. It also portrays their relationships and interactions with each other very well, and everything going on inside their minds.\nThe animation of NGE is really, really cool. The show is, like, what, 12 years old by now? That is something I wouldn't entirely believe by watching this show, as the animation style is, even today, very good - it's flawless, and the effects are really good, and not to mention that they have done the battles very well. It was amazing when it was new, and I dare to say that it's amazing even today.\nI really like the music in this series too - there's some really great themes, especially the OP and ED themes. The OP is simply the best song ever, and the ED theme is a really great song named Fly Me to the Moon, or to be more specific, a version of it. That song is fantastic, and it has a place in my heart thanks to NGE.\nTo be honest, if you haven't watched the show yet, go watch it this instant. You've definitely missed something.\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=214,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    Overview:\nTime to travel back to the mid 1990s and evaluate one of the most influential anime of the last quarter century! Evangelion was once hailed as the deepest anime to ever exist. The random references to Gnostic Christianity, Jungian psychology, cross shaped explosions, and inclusion of classical music was seen as the very zenith of intelligence in anime. Eventually this caused a massive backlash and much like its fellow 90s hit, American beauty, internet critics attempted to push it off the pedestal and into the mud. It became all the rage to bash Eva for being pretentious and even the writer/director, Hideaki Anno, said that\n          \n        most of the symbolism was totally pointless. Anno stated that he \"hated most of the fandom, and that Eva had become the most overrated anime in history.\" Of course Anno does suffer from clinical depression and tends to be extemely self depreciating much like his protagonist Shinji. Although it doesn't have quite the critical acclaim it once did, the bashing has calmed down and Eva is currently going through a positive reassessment by the anime viewing public. \n\nThe story and its characters:\nThe story of Eva is simple on the surface at least. Aliens come to Earth and kids must pilot giant robots in order to stop them. We have seen this in countless anime and sentai shows right? What Eva did was rather brilliantly deconstruct this concept and show why emotionally fragile teenagers being given giant robots and told to save humanity would be a TERRIBLE idea. Eva is known for its many plot twists and ambiguity that leaves itself open to viewer interpretation. This is especially true for End of Evangelion and its ending, but it applies to the original ending as well. One problem many had with the original series and a reason for the many reboots was the highly limited animation budget during the second half of the series. It is a true story that Studio Gainax actually blew almost the entire budget on the first half, so that resulted in later episode scenes such as the infamous 10 minute escalator scene. The ending 2 episodes had so little budget left over that they are basically like watching a powerpoint presentation for an intro to philosophy class at your local community college! I'm not joking, that's exactly what it is! One thing Eva did well that can't be denied was that Anno really bared his soul with us and showed us the depths of  his depression and his angst. Anno claims he created the series to cope with the death of his mother. This was massively ambitious for a 1995 shounen. Eva pushed the boundaries in shounen and allowed psychological drama in anime to become more main stream. Before Eva, most shounen protagonists were plucky and happy go lucky like Goku from DBZ. By making Shinji a whiny kid with Freudian issues, Anno was reinventing the Shonen hero. This actually turned out to be a brilliant move because lonely and awkward Otaku could identify with Shinji and empathize in a way that they couldn't with the invincible Kenshiro or Goku. This empathy that viewers felt, made him an original and moving protagonist for the then rather stagnant Shounen genre. In one interview a kid famously asked Anno what Rei was like because we see so little of her personality. Anno being... Anno responded that she doesn't have a personality because she is a poorly written character by a terrible author. However, Rei's extremely mysterious nature and good looks made her one of the most beloved anime heroines of all time. In Japan she was known as \"the premium girl\" because figurines of her sold so well (despite the fact that this disgusted Anno). Asuka is a bundle of teenage hormones and anger with as many psychological abandonment issues as Shinji. She is brash, loud, and incredibly obnoxious, but the audience still cares about her because the show does such a great job inspiring empathy for her character. Almost all of Eva's characters are psychological basket cases, whose very dysfunctionality makes them that much more interesting.\nart, music, and technical stuff:\nThe opening theme is ranked among the greatest in anime history and the rest of the soundtrack is quite good as well. It really fits the atmosphere and amplifies the drama. This is especially true for the rather brilliant use of classical music, which had been done before in anime like Legend of the Galactic Heroes, but wasn't common or main stream in 1995. The art and animation in the first half of the series was spectacular and put Studio Gainax on the map. Eva is a very well made show from a technical view and still quite impressive in its art and animation even 20 years later.\nmy final thoughts:\n If you are reading this and somehow haven't seen Eva yet, I suggest you go forward knowing that it is flawed, but that it also has a lot of things it does well. It was a series that dared to be different, and had some real ambition. Yes, at times it could be pretentious, superficial, and just plain silly, but that doesn't erase the contributions that Eva made to anime as a genre and shonen in particular. I award Eva with a 7/10. \nPS. If you like psychologically damaged characters fighting aliens with giant robots and TONS of religious and philosophy allusions check out Xenogears for PS1 and the Xenosaga trilogy for the PS2. It is basically Eva...only better. Just be aware that these games can get EXTREMELY pricey especially Xenogears and Xenosage Episode 3: Also Sprach Zarathustra.\n        "},

Please read to the end, as my recommendation may surprise.\nThe biggest sin of NGE, in my opinion, is wasted potential. Be warned, I'll be touching on spoilers here, though I'll try to avoid any actual plot developments.\nStory: 5\nThe story of NGE actually starts off rather strong. Eldritch abominations are attacking the world (primarily Japan), and only might mechs known as Eva-Units can defeat them. The only catch, only certain children can pilot these mechs, and doing so requires mental synchronization with the machines (in other words, if the\n          \n        robot's arm gets ripped off, the pilot gets to feel it). I love this premise, and it proves a great deconstruction of the genre. The problem is that eventually the story devolves into a pity party so full of skin-deep symbolism that there's no real... victory involved. There's bad ends, and then there's spiraling into a whirlpool of depression that aims to take the world with it.\nArt: 5\nThe art direction is actually rather solid. Character designs are unique, for the time (really everyone else began copying this), and when the show does an action scene, they do a wonderful job of it. Sadly, the limited budget of the show leaves us with several scenes that consist of stills. Still, props for doing a great job with what they had.\nSound: 7\nA true high point of the show, this is where a great chunk of effort came it. Even the dub is quality, and it's a 90's dub. I came in expecting a few laughs, but I was pleasantly surprised. The music is well-done, but not varied. I mean, I love fly me to the moon, but pick another song, Hideaki.\nCharacters: 3\nHoo-boy. This is the hardest part for me. It's not that the characters are bad, per se; it's that they had wonderful potential for growth, and then stagnate AT BEST. Shinji is a whiny wimp who looks like he'd fit in well in a coming of age story. Sadly, he stays in the whole \"Somebody love me!\" stage pretty much the whole way through, and the few times he does grow, some event comes along to destroy it. Rei is an... acceptable excuse, but that's going into spoiler territory. Clever naming though. I can approve. The other likable characters all have something come along to ruin the growth they've had (again, heading into spoilers, so I have to be a little vague). Gendo's a prick. I am accepting of this fact. Moving on. Asuka................ she could have been great. She could have been one of the best characters in the show. She starts off selfish, and abusive, and arrogant. It's shown later that she came from a damaged family. But rather than realizing that there are people who care about her, that she doesn't need to prove anything, she just spirals into depression worse than any other character.\nEnjoyment: 1\nI know this will vary heavily from person to person, but what I love most in a story is character growth. As detailed above, I didn't get that AT ALL, and it really hampered my enjoyment of the show.\nOverall, should you watch this? Yes. At least once. The show has some virtues, but I felt those virtues were heavily overshadowed by the themes of depression that began to permeate the show. It can be done right, but I don't think NGE was the show for it. Just be sure you're in a stable frame of mind when you do watch it. I've met those who actually fell into bouts of depression after watching this show's conclusion. Oh, and thanks for reading to the end.\n        "},
		{["score"]=2,  ["helpful"]=188,  ["text"]="                          \n    Hugely experimental and thankfully unique, Evangelion is a roaring failure.\nYeah, there might be spoilers but I'll try to stay away from them.\nAfter watching several series, I finally ran across something that I actively disliked.  Maybe if you are a (shudder) person who enjoys a nice bit of Camus to go along with your nightshade cocktail, you will really dig this series.  Otherwise this one is going to be painful.\nSTORY: Evan starts off moderately interesting.  For some convoluted reason a teenager is the only one who can pilot a super-mega-awesome-gigantor-robot for some convoluted reason.  We've seen it before -- it allows the\n          \n        target shounen audience to have characters they can identify (i.e. lazy kid) get to play the hero instead of someone more realistic -- say a 30-year-old ace captain with years of conflict experience and (more importantly) some emotional maturity.  But hey, not like this is the first time.  So we get the normal mecha-on-mecha action sequences, which are kinda cool, and the expected teen drama stuff.  Oh, and some daddy issues, because what is anime without a justified hatred of one's parents?\nAND THEN THE SERIES LOSES IT'S FREAKING MIND\nThere is no better way to put it. I read on wikipedia that the person responsible for this travesty of philosophic trite had a bad batch of depression, and it shows.  Anytime sci-fi has to double back to religious fantasy, it fails.  I \"got\" the story but I hated it.  Around this time the series shifts to adult themes over shounen, which is kinda cool.  But since everyone was afraid of losing their jobs at the time (per Wikipedia \"but also partly because by this point, production had begun running out of funding and failing to meet the schedule; this collapse has been identified by at least one Gainax employee as the impetus for Evangelion's turn into metafiction...\")  they decide to spew out a bunch of woe-is-me-the-world-sucks garbage.  \nART: Art here is decent.  Not great, but decent.  Since this was a 90's anime, this is very excusable.  At the time, the art had to be fantastic.  Thank god I started watching anime now than back in the day.  \nSound: Passable.  Nothing great, nothing too easy to beat up on.  \nCharacter: Anyone who tells you that they liked the characters is lying (a) to themselves and/or (b) to you.  All of them, especially the protagonist, have extremely annoying qualities (whinny, self-absorbed, withdrawn) that begin to drag on one's nerves.  The protagonist particularly sucks -- 4 weeks of basic bootcamp as Gomer Pile would have given him something to really cry about.  \nEnjoyment: There is a reason why this series almost bankrupted the company.  This is not what all anime should be, entertaining.  \nOverall: I was really looking forward to this anime after hearing such great things about it.  For the life of me, I cannot figure out why this is so well-regarded.  I think it's because if you are the type of person that thinks the same as as some of the characters, this anime will sing to your soul or something.  But if you are well-adjusted and enjoy life, it will not.  \nSometimes classics are deserving, sometimes they are not.  This anime is the latter.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=169,  ["text"]="                          \n    This was a rather tricky programme to review. Great pains were taken to avoid spoilers so if you're a fan of Eva, please don't take umbrage with me for not going in-depth with certain areas. If you happen to dislike Eva or feel that it's overrated, I'd still encourage you to read through this entire review. Feedback is greatly appreciated, as always. On another note, this review will NOT cover Evangelion's religious symbolism at all. I tried to in earlier drafts of this review, but they just made the review much longer and more tedious than they needed to be.\nThe last thing I want to\n          \n        talk about before I go into the review is the current state of Evangelion's licensing. Unfortunately, Neon Genesis Evangelion is currently unlicensed. It was originally licensed to ADV Films before its inevitable collapse and then the license was transferred over to Section23 Films. Unfortunately, the license expired in mid-2012 and the show has since gone out-of-print with the official DVD releases of the programme priced as high as $300 on Amazon. I am aware that Evangelion was also licensed by Madmen Entertainment in Australia, however I'm not too sure if Madmen Entertainment still holds the license.\nThe best we can hope for is Funimation to pick up the show and give it a Blu-ray release in honour of Evangelion's upcoming 20th birthday in November of 2015. If you wish to watch Evangelion, you'll either have to settle for bankruptcy and buy the DVDs for an absurdly high price, torrent it, or watch it on a site like KissAnime or what have you. Sorry, that's just the way it is. ;-;\n***\n\"Evangelion\" is a name that you've either heard of in the past or have just read about now since you're reading this review. Arguably one of the most influential and yet most controversial anime series of all time, this is a show that you'll either love the hell out of, viscerally hate, or just watch once and then go on to cut your wrists and black your eyes so you can fall asleep tonight and die (please tell me you get the reference). Okay, that's not really fair but it's still something to be said that virtually EVERYONE who goes into Evangelion comes out with something different.\nNow, a lot of people say that this show is nothing more than pretentious garbage and that interpretation certainly is a valid one, given that there are some moments where this show feels like it gets up its own ass. BUT, that's not entirely the case. I don't really care how much of a pretentious fanboy I sound like when I say this, but in order for you to \"properly\" appreciate Evangelion, you'll have to understand the mindset of Hideaki Anno when he went on to create this programme.\nNow, I'm not completely filled in on his back-story, but this is how I understand things went down around the time Eva was being produced: Anno fell into depression for four years, he became disillusioned with the otaku lifestyle, among other such things. He was angry and he needed an outlet to vent out his frustrations. Seeing as how he was an animator, he decided to come up with an anime series that would basically just be one big \"FUCK YOU\" to whomever he pleased (which at the time were the otakus whom he's grown to despise) and would just ruin the very things that specific group loves.\nThe concepts behind this programme were simple: what would happen if we took real people and forced them into similar situations that happened in any Gundam and/or any harem show? Not only that, but what would people realistically be like if a post-apocalyptic situation occurred? What would happen to the son of a man who lost his wife and was appointed to be head of an organisation which deploys giant robots to fight some unknown threat? How would common anime archetypes translate into the real world? Combine these ideas with a frustrated animator with a lot of pent-up rage against a community of people whose lifestyle he became disillusioned with plus extremely stressful work conditions and what you'll get is Neon Genesis Evangelion.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion was a project that was seemingly destined to do two things: tank horribly and either worsen Hideaki Anno's depression or drive him to suicide. Gainax's poor accounting practices at the time basically meant that Evangelion was given a very small budget to work with (which was almost completely exhausted before the final two episodes were made; more on that later) and the general consensus at the time was that Evangelion would get cancelled within 5-10 episodes. However, their assumptions couldn't have been further from the truth. Evangelion was a huge success, and what probably kept Gainax from going out of business at that point in time. Why was it such a huge success? I don't know, but I'm guessing because it effectively took all of the mecha and harem tropes and then completely subverted them.\nHave you ever wished that the world you lived in was more like the anime(s) that you love so dearly? Let's say for example you're an avid fan of mech shows, would you wish that your life would be similar to the main character's life in your favourite mech show? I mean... YOU GET TO PILOT A GIANT FUCKING ROBOT. Instant respect from the common bystander, girls with low self-esteem and questionable morals may very well end up dropping their panties at the sight of you, and once again: YOU GET TO PILOT A GIANT FUCKING ROBOT. Remember the MEGAS XLR theme? “You dig giant robots, I dig giant robots, we dig giant robots, chicks dig giant robots.” Well... sometimes it's not always like that.\nYou see, MEGAS XLR takes the optimistic route. However, Evangelion is thoroughly entrenched in pessimism. Every single character in the show has some deep-seated psychological trauma, and I do mean EVERY character. From the Eva pilots to the commanders at NERV and even the random bystander who had no dialogue, every single person in Evangelion is fucked up in the head. Why is everyone like that? Because of the eminent threat of death. The entire world as people once knew it was completely destroyed, leaving many places to be desolate wastelands. Half of humanity's population was eradicated with the only traces of their existence being grave markers. Whole cities are wiped off the map and the survivors ended up being forced to relocate. 15 years of relative peace then gets interrupted when the mysterious Angels start attacking, seemingly for no apparent reason.\nOne rather bizarre thing to note is that you can't really tell that since the first 15 or so episodes of Evangelion do follow a rather typical mech show formula... albeit with a special twist thrown in here and there. Jovial and upbeat music is a rather frequent sight, we get to see common harem tropes at work, etc. Hell, Evangelion actually kind of felt like a feel-good mecha/harem show (in a vein similar to Full Metal Panic!). BUT... then came along Episode 16, and then you got to see how fucked up and morbid EVERYTHING about this show is. We get to see that Shinji's lifestyle isn't a real sex fantasy, and the women in Evangelion are actual women with real problems who DON'T need a penis to feel like they're worth something. We also learn how thankless being an Eva pilot really is.\nEVERYONE'S livelihoods are directly linked to the success of the giant robot pilot. Under such conditions, you wouldn't receive the praise and the respect of the people for being a pilot. If you fuck up, you're  directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds upon thousands. If you succeed, you get nothing because that's what you're supposed to do. Let's not forget the fact that this EXTREMELY heavy responsibility is being placed on the shoulders of teenagers. Why? Well, it's never properly explained why but truth be told, there's no need for any explanation. Hideaki Anno wanted to create a show that would subvert common mecha/harem tropes, and one thing that a lot of mech shows at the time had in common was the fact that the pilots were very young OR had deceptively youthful appearances.\nThe whole point of Evangelion is to show what would happen if we took three teenagers and forced them to not only deal with the burdens of society and their own adolescence, but also having to pilot a giant robot in order to SAVE THE WORLD where the threat of their own deaths is always a very real possibility with virtually no sympathy whatsoever. An explanation as to why our pilots are adolescents would certainly be appreciated, but it's not outright necessary to the plot. With that said, let's take a look at our characters. Evangelion's got a wide variety of characters, each with their own varying degrees of depth and relevance, but let's just take a look at our three mecha pilots and their overseer.\nFans of Eva and pretty much anyone else who's ever taken a cursory look at the Evangelion franchise as a whole will pretty much come to the same conclusion about Shinji: he's a whiny, useless little bitch boy who runs away from everything and well... yeah, he's guilty as charged. But why is that? Keep in mind: he's supposed to be what our lead mecha pilot would realistically be like given the situation he's placed in. His father abandoned him so that he can work with some government organisation he's never even heard of and his mother's dead. Obviously there's going to be some abandonment issues at work but it's not just that. \nThe first time he's seen his father in umpteen years, and Gendo tells him to get into a giant robot and fight against some unknown threat with absolutely no prior notice, no training, or anything of the sort and there's a good chance that he may very well end up being killed. How else is he supposed to react? Is Shinji supposed to be ecstatic that he'll be piloting a giant robot? NO!!! I don't care what you say, if it were you in that very position, you sure as hell would do exactly what Shinji's doing. I mean, piloting a giant robot is cool and all, but if you have to pilot a giant robot at such short notice with no training or anything of the sort against an unknown threat that may very well end up killing you, common sense dictates you having to think more than twice about this.\nHe runs away from his problems rather than confronting them because truth be told, that's a relatively normal response. Think of everything I just mentioned: his pre-existing psychological trauma, the burdens of society and adolescence placed upon him, his ESTRANGED father using him as a means to an end, having to pilot a giant robot and combat mysterious beings that may very well end up killing him, all the while having to put up with all of that with virtually no sympathy whatsoever. All things considered, he's got balls for actually getting into the damn robot in the first place. When he does run away, he always returns. Sure, he can run away in the midst of an angel attack like anyone else would. But when he's confronted with the reality of the situation: where mindless destruction occurs and innocent people get caught in the crossfire, he inevitably comes back to save the day because he knows that he can put an end to all of the madness. \nWhen you take all of that into consideration, Shinji isn't as unlikeable as he might seem. HOWEVER... I will concede that Shinji can get rather intolerable at times (alongside Asuka for reasons I'll explain later). That's his biggest character flaw: yes, he's empathetic and my sympathies really do lie with him for a good chunk of the show. HOWEVER, his constant complaining gets rather irritating after a certain point, and you're just begging for him to shut the fuck up and do something. Thankfully, we get a heaping helping of catharsis whenever Shinji overstays his welcome in the form of seeing Shinji getting his ass handed to him by Angels and the like. Okay, well he's not an incompetent Eva pilot in the slightest (quite the contrary) but I just can't help but feel immensely satisfied seeing Shinji get his ass handed to him after I just watched him do NOTHING but complain. But, I digress.\nNow we come over to Asuka Langley Soryu, the Second Child. Now, Asuka actually makes her debut rather late in comparison to the other Eva pilots (Asuka shows up in Episode 8, rather than the pilot episode like the others) but regardless, she still manages to make more than enough of an impact on the story while not faltering a bit in her characterisation. One of the second biggest complaints I hear about people who don't like Eva is the fact that Asuka is an intolerable tsundere bitch. You know what? You're right on the money with that one: Asuka was specifically designed to get under your skin and make you hate her. Hell, she gets under my skin 5 times out of 10. But why is this?\nWell, given that Shinji is what our lead mecha pilot would realistically be like, what sort of trope(s) is Asuka meant to tackle? Well... I've got a faint idea of what Asuka is supposed to be: she's supposed to be the embodiment of how tsunderes would actually be like in real life, while also being the complete polar opposite of Shinji. While Shinji is passive and introverted, Asuka is aggressive and extroverted. Did I forget to mention that she's also a combat prodigy akin to Mikasa Ackermann from Attack on Titan? Despite all of this, she suffers from almost the same kind of psychological trauma that Shinji suffers from. \nHer aloof and confident exterior is just a mask for a gaping inferiority complex that rivals that of Mello's from Death Note. She's a combat prodigy because piloting Eva-02 is the only way for her to ever feel validated. She lives for the praise of others, and thus can't stand it whenever someone steals her thunder. When Shinji and/or Rei save her from being killed by an Angel, she takes umbrage with them because it's not the angel she lost to, it's Shinji/Rei that she lost to.\nBeing such an obnoxious tsundere half the time, it's only natural for her to end up like Shinji whenever she overstays her welcome. What do I mean? Well, whereas Shinji just gets roughed up by the Angels or what have you, Asuka gets taken down a few pegs if she ends up overstaying her welcome and it's just so cathartic to see her squirm whenever Gendo, Ritsuko, or Misato are favouring Shinji or Rei over her. With that said, she's also the most entertaining Eva pilot to watch given that she's great at combat and if nothing else, some of her banter with Shinji et al is rather amusing to say the least.\nWith so much hostility built up toward her comrades, one would expect her to not show any compassion whatsoever. BUT, that's not the case at all. Remember, Asuka is a tsundere (a rather extreme one, but a tsundere none the less). She's got an aloof exterior, but people keep forgetting that loving interior of hers... which is quite understandable since it never really manifests itself all that often but when it does, it's certainly going to catch you off-guard. The most bizarre thing is that she's 14 years old, yet she's constantly throwing herself at her \"keeper,\" Ryoji Kaji who is quite literally twice her age. It might seem off-putting to you and you might dismiss it because it's okay in Japan or some shit like that. HOWEVER, THIS WAS ACTUALLY OFF-PUTTING TO JAPANESE VIEWERS TOO!!!! But strangely enough, her \"deredere\" characterisation always manages to come into play whenever Asuka is around Kaji.\nSo, you might think that Asuka only shows this other side of her personality to Kaji BUT you'd be sorely mistaken. You see, as bizarre as it might be... Asuka and Shinji actually have a thing for one another. The problem? They're both completely fucked up in the head. Did you honestly expect their relationship to resemble something out of a feel-good romcom ecchi harem? Oh fuck no. This is Evangelion! Whenever one side tries to make a move on the other, the other pushes them away. Asuka's aggressive attitude is what's keeping Shinji from approaching her. However, Shinji's withdrawn and passive personality is the very reason WHY Asuka lashes out at him. It's the perpetual dance of hedgehogs... which actually brings me to something I forgot to mention earlier.\nConsidering the fact that almost EVERYONE in Evangelion is fucked up in the head, it's only natural for them to be unable to form any sort of healthy relationships. This leads to something known as the \"hedgehog's dilemma.\" When it's cold, hedgehogs tend to huddle together for warmth. The problem is the fact that the closer the hedgehogs get to one another, the more they risk hurting each other. Character relationships in Evangelion work the exact same way, especially given how fucked up everyone is in this show. As much as you'd probably hope for Shinji, Asuka, Rei, Misato, Gendo, Ritsuko, or whatever other character(s) you've grown attached to actually improve/grow as characters, that will NEVER be the case. That's one of the more depressing aspects about Evangelion, which is such a shame given that I grew quite fond of Shinji despite how unbearable he can get. But, I digress.\nNow we have Rei Ayanami... aka Hideaki Anno's greatest success and greatest failure. Rei Ayanami is one of the most interesting things about Evangelion. You see, Hideaki Anno created Rei in order to demonstrate just how creepy an emotionless doll character would be. HOWEVER, that wasn't the case at all. Instead, Hideaki Anno pretty much created the prototypical moe girl. Rei was so popular to the point where other programmes ended up creating \"clones\" of her, each with their own varying degrees of depth and/or development with some clones (i.e. Yuki Nagato from Haruhi) getting better character development than Rei herself ever received.\nBut why is Rei so popular? Well, my inner cynic tells me that given how Rei is submissive, doesn't talk back, and the like, perverse otakus took to her because they now had material to work with for their rape fantasies. HOWEVER... while I did find Rei to actually be rather creepy when I actually did stop and think, there were many moments where she was portrayed as a helpless victim (did I forget to mention that she pioneered the bandage girl aesthetic?), and I genuinely did find myself wanting to protect her. You know... I can't help but wonder how different Rei could've been if she wasn't always wearing a cast/eye patch/bandage and didn't get herself into situations that would evoke a protective instinct.\nNow, as strange as this might sound... I actually could find myself relating to Rei, even if only a little. Maybe it's because I'm introverted and I don't really talk to people I don't know all that much but it's still something to be mentioned. The bizarre thing is that Rei herself actually isn't emotionless, but rather she doesn't know how to express them until Shinji asks her to smile to express gratitude after saving her in Episode 6. Okay, well... compared to how bizarre the rest of the show gets toward the end, I guess this is actually relatively normal. It's still something to be mentioned, though.\nThe last character I'm willing to talk about is Misato Katsuragi, who actually witnessed and lived through the apocalypse that set the stage for Evangelion. Now, as a survivor of the Second Impact, you'd think that she'd also have some deep-seated psychological trauma and well... yeah, she definitely does. However, in comparison to Shinji and Asuka, Misato is arguably the most well-adjusted of them all. She's jovial when she needs to be and serious when the situation calls for it. She also provides all three Eva pilots with much-needed emotional support... although they rarely capitalise on said emotional support.\nMisato is quite likeable, and she really does help prevent the show from turning into a teenage angst-ridden melodrama. HOWEVER... there were quite a few things I found rather unnerving about her character. For example, the way she introduces herself to Shinji is with a picture of her bending over with her right hand making a peace sign... with an arrow pointing to her cleavage. However, just like how Kaji is twice as old as Asuka, Misato is twice as old as Shinji. Of course, Shinji doesn't really display the same sort of... \"attraction\" to Misato that Asuka displays to Kaji. \nAfter this, Misato tries to behave more like a motherly figure to Shinji... while still hinting that Misato is a potential love interest for Shinji. You know... it's not the subliminal Oedipus complex that disturbs me. It's the fact that Misato is actually attracted enough to a 14-year-old boy to actually send a picture of herself in such a pose to make the first impression and yet somehow ignore all of that JUST to be a motherly figure to him. It also doesn't help that End of Evangelion further complicates shit like that, but let's cross that bridge when we get to it. So, as good of a character as Misato is... she just creeps me out (moreso than Rei, which is rather surprising).\nTaking a break from all of that rambling about story and characters, let's get on with one of Evangelion's biggest flaws: its animation (or lack thereof... asterisk). While the art direction is pretty damn good and everything as a nice amount of detail put into it, the actual animation can just get downright lazy and there are some decisions where you'll just find yourself wondering \"Really? Was it actually necessary to animate something so pointless as that?\" So in some respects, the actual animation feels vaguely reminiscent of Gantz, although it was never quite THAT bad. However, there's a LOT of points in the show where you can quite obviously tell where they cut corners... or rather took out a chainsaw and cut huge segments out of.\nFor example, there are a lot of segments where the camera is zoomed into the characters face, so they don't have to animate anything but the mouth movements. HOWEVER, there are MANY instances where Gainax actually had the mouths covered, obscured by light, or just plain out-of-focus so they don't even have to pay to animate the mouth movements. Fun fact: Gendo Ikari's signature pose is a direct result of the lack of budget this show had! Almost all of his appearances where he had any dialogue of relevance, his hands would be covering his mouth so Gainax wouldn't even have to pay to animate the lip-flap movements.\nThere are also an annoyingly high number of points where we end up staring at still frames with nothing but ambient noise playing in the background for almost 3 minutes (I'm looking at you, Episode 4)! You know... if they were just doing this shit because of a corporate mandate for episode length, they could've just done us all a favour and just let us stare at a black screen for 3 minutes in silence. That would've been a million leagues more entertaining than making us sit through 3 minutes of Shinji staring at Misato while ambient noise was going on in the background, only for Shinji to say \"I'm home\" and then cut to the end credits.\nThere's also no shortage of segments where they ended up re-using the same few frames of animation in the earlier episodes where it was all jovial and shit. But, I can't really hold that against Evangelion since many anime series I watched that came from the early 90s (i.e. Sailor Moon, Gundam Wing) ended up doing that at some point or another. Eva just happens to do it on a more frequent basis across a shorter period of time. With that said... it's still rather off-putting, but then again I grew up in the late 90s and early 2000s where anime was starting to actually have a budget so hell if I'd know.\nAnother bizarre thing to note about the animation itself is the fact that there's no shortage of fan service available to the point where Tiffany Grant, Asuka's English VA would say that there would be more fan service in the next episode during the next-episode preview at the end of the one I just watched. You'd think that the fan service would be used in such a way where it would actually be used to keep everyone's interest in the show while the animation budget slowly went away, right? You'd be sorely mistaken. As early as the first episode, we get treated to out-of-place shots of Misato's ass and breasts among other such things. HOWEVER, the fan service almost entirely dissipates by Episode 16 as the show gets increasingly morbid.\nI know I spent a great deal bitching about the how lazy/odd the animation gets, BUT thankfully Gainax manages to make up for it in almost every single episode... except the final two because of reasons I'll get into in a minute or two. Basically, the vast majority of the budget was spent animating the Eva battles, and the remainder of it was spent on everything else. The Eva battles are perhaps some of the most entertaining fights I've ever seen in any mecha anime I've ever seen, and my guess is that if Gainax gave Evangelion a bigger budget, THIS is what the rest of the show would look like. So I can't stay TOO hard on the animation.\nHowever, that lack of budget REALLY affects the storytelling to such a negative degree that you can't even begin to imagine. I mean, we get so many stills and walk cycles of Shinji to the point where it becomes tedious and you just begin to lose interest in what you're watching. The most infamous example of how bad the lack of budget affects the storytelling is the final two episodes. Basically, there was virtually NO budget left for these two episodes and the vast majority of it was spent re-using animation and having a good chunk of the episode animated in pencil... I shit you not, that actually did happen. Basically, nothing gets explained (directly) and there's a quite obvious lack of resolution.\nNow, it's not like these two episodes are pointless since they do provide quite a bit of character insight and if you pay close enough attention, you start to get a faint idea of what just went down in the real world, since these last two episodes take place inside Shinji and Asuka's heads. HOWEVER... this was such a drastic change of style to the point where fans of the programme quite literally mailed death threats to Hideaki Anno/Gainax (some of which actually do show up in End of Evangelion). Suffice it to say, this was the programme that Gainax ended up developing their infamous reputation with how they end their shows.\nHideaki Anno and Gainax did eventually go on to produce Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion which is how the final two episodes of Evangelion were supposed to be (according to Hideaki Anno), but that didn't come by until 1997 and I don't even want to imagine how long it took for Manga Entertainment to license the movie, dub it, and distribute it only to go out-of-print a few years later. As far as endings go, I have to give EoE its own review but I will say this: it does a MUCH better job of resolving the story of Evangelion while still retaining that sort of \"what the fuck am I watching?\" atmosphere that Eva is known for.\nThe last thing I want to talk about in regard to Evangelion is the audio portion of it all. Now, the OST for Evangelion doesn't really do much to stick out and with the exception of the opening and a few tracks that play whenever shit gets REALLY morbid, there isn't really going to be much that would stick out in your mind unless you pay an unusually large amount of attention to what you listen to. The OP track, \"Cruel Angel's Thesis\" is a beloved classic and with great reason. It's matched with visuals that perfectly flow with the tone of the song and if nothing else, I find myself humming it at the most random of times. The ED however is nothing more than Muzak you'd hear in an elevator of a classy hotel or something, so there's that.\nNow we come to the most interesting part of Evangelion: the English dub. This is a pre-Bebop dub, so you might think that this dub is shit. However, that couldn't be further from the truth. With the exception of the first four or so episodes, the entire dub is quite well-cast and executed. The reason why I left out the first four episodes is due to the fact that it was quite obvious that the VAs were getting accustomed to their roles and as such, there are quite a few segments of the first few episodes that sound... off, to say the least.\nNow, I can't put too much blame on the director of the dub since he/she does smooth things out rather early on. HOWEVER, Evangelion 1.0 which happens to be a retelling of the first six episodes has the same cast as this dub, but it doesn't sound anywhere near as off as the first four episodes of the TV series. To be fair, the Rebuild of Evangelion movies are licensed by Funimation and they do a great job of their dubs while the TV series was licensed by ADV Films: a company that doesn't really seem to have a standard for dubbing quality given that so many of the things they've licensed (i.e. Elfen Lied, Azumanga Daioh, 5 Centimetres per Second, Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal) have dubs that vary quite a bit in terms of actual quality.\nSpike Spencer does an excellent job of voicing Shinji, as does Tiffany Grant voicing Asuka. What I love about Grant's work as Asuka is the fact that she's fluent in German. Why is this important? Because Asuka herself is German and there are a few points where she speaks in German. That's a nice little touch and it's the small things like this that make me smile. However, my favourite performance would definitely have to come from John Swasey voicing Gendo Ikari. He does a great job at capturing just how cold and emotionally distant he is from Shinji and he plays off of Spike Spencer quite well in scenes where Shinji and Gendo have a lot of dialogue together. As for everyone else, they do a great job with the roles they've been given so props to ADV for not making a dub that's complete shit in the mid-to-late 90s.\nOn the whole, Neon Genesis Evangelion is certainly an experience that NO ONE should miss out on. This is one of those shows that has a reputation for being one gigantic mind fuck, which is true in some cases, but the story itself is rather easy to follow... it just gets rather tedious in the beginning because Gainax. Is it as great as people say it is? Oh fuck no. Is it a pretentious piece of garbage? Pretentious on occasion, but garbage? HELL to the fucking NO. If you seriously want a good idea of what Evangelion is like, you should just do yourself a favour and watch it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=134,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most well known anime of the 1990s. Whether someone recommended it to you or you happened to read the name in passing, Evangelion is a name that’s impossible to escape if you’re a part of the anime community. However, with its fame also comes controversy. The show has got to be one of the most divisive anime ever made. Many love it and consider it to be one of the greatest anime to come out of the 1990s and others consider it to be a pretentious mess with irritating characters. Well based on the score I’m pretty sure\n          \n        you can see which category I fall under. So without further ado let’s dig in.\nThe show is basically set  15 years after a global cataclysm and revolves around a secret organization called NERV which combats mysterious creatures known as Angels using things called Evangelions which are essentially mechas that are piloted by 14 year olds. Sounds simple enough right? The show starts off with a “monster of the week” narrative as Angels arrive in Tokyo 3 to fuck shit up and our three heroes use their Evas to combat them while employing different strategies each episode depending on what the Angel can do. These early episodes give us a basic albeit solid understanding of the setting as exposition is given through older characters as well as TV news reports, newspapers and the like. The early episodes also give us a solid understanding of a lot of major characters as some episodes don’t even feature any Angel battles and are just there to flesh out characters and their relationships with other characters. This is also done through fantastic character interactions that are, a lot of the time, filled with subtext. And speaking of subtext, there is a lot of foreshadowing in the show’s first half. It can be quite apparent when you eventually get to what it was foreshadowing later on or it can be oh so very subtle and thus the show is something that should be viewed more than once. It’ll set you up for a different experience each time knowing what is revealed to you later in the show. The tone of the first half can be very tense during its battle scenes considering what’s at stake and certain variables can get thrown in that make it all the more tense. Couple this with top-notch fight choreography and entertaining strategies and tactics and you have yourself a hell of an entertaining viewing experience. In contrast to this the moments off the battlefield are highly entertaining as well with well timed and very amusing comedic relief as well as the occasional dosage of fanservice (yummy).  \nThe show’s second half however is where shit gets real and the tone gets darker. The tense and entertaining battle scenes are still there, but they’re a lot darker and have more psychological implications than those of the first half. The encounters with the Angels start to reveal the personal flaws and mental states of the characters as well as force characters to make tough decisions and witness traumatizing things. The comedic scenes are still there, but used a lot more sparingly and the fanservice virtually disappears from the show altogether. The show begins to get inside the heads of the characters and peels back their layers, revealing them as more complex than we were initially led to believe. The second half of the show also contains a lot of revelations, many of which were foreshadowed during the first half so as not to feel contrived. The conspiracy subplot involving NERV’s true purpose that was very briefly touched upon in the first half is now a lot more prevalent, character motivations are revealed, key plot points and mysteries are explained and tragic backstories are revealed. \nThe show is rather vague with certain story details and those looking for straightforward answers might be disappointed but it dangles the carrot close enough for the viewer to reach without it being too confusing. It goes for visual rather than verbal exposition at times and this is yet another reason the show should be watched more than once. \nThe show’s ending is…perhaps the most controversial thing about the show aside from the characters. The original TV ending for the show was made due to Gainax running out of funds and thus having to scrap the original ending for a more minimalistic one. While this ending does provide fantastic insight into the characters’ motivations, goals, emotions, wishes and fears it does leave quite a bit to be desired with regards to the story. Key plot points are left unexplained and this does leave the viewer feeling somewhat confused and maybe even a tad pissed off. However there is of course the film ending that is just as if not more controversial than the TV ending. That film is The End of Evangelion. It ties up the loose ends left by the series and provides us with fantastic and much needed closure for the character arcs. It also provides a context for the ending of the TV series, and the two surprisingly go hand in hand very well.  \nNow lets talk about one of the most divisive aspects of the show; its cast of characters. In my opinion, this is where the show shines brighter than most others as it has one of the most complex and fleshed out character casts I have ever encountered in any story. \nThe protagonist Shinji Ikari gets a lot of shit from both fans and haters of the show for being a “pussy” and an “irritating brat”. Well I’ll let you in on a nasty little fact about me; Shinji is one of my favourite anime protagonists of all time. Granted he’s angsty and whiny but he has good reasons for being the way he is. His mother died under dreadful circumstances when he was very young, his father had been absent for most of his childhood and when he’s reunited with him he chucks him into a situation he knows fuck all about and makes him carry the heavy burden of the fate of the city by making him pilot a mecha he initially knows fuck all about in order to fight a gigantic monster he knows fuck all about. Yeah, I don’t think I’d be a happy chappy either. In spite of this he’s thankfully given more depth than simply “being a pussy”. He’s given moments of levity in order to make him feel more human and said moments of levity make a lot of the things that happen to him throughout the show feel all the more poignant. \nAnother character who gets a lot of flack is Asuka Langley Soryu. She’s another pilot and serves as Shinji’s foil. While Shinji is shy, quiet and introverted, she’s loud, egotistical and energetic. A lot of people hate her because they see her as annoying, vain and bitchy. Quite frankly I find her obnoxious too and fail to see what all the lonely weeaboos see in her but I digress as that’s beside the point. She is an incredibly well written character and I find her intriguing in spite of my contempt for her personality. Her chemistry with Shinji is fantastic and she too has reasons for acting the way she does, which I won’t spoil. \nThe third pilot in the series is a girl named Rei Ayanami. She’s a seemingly emotionless girl who is very subservient. Her initial ambiguity is intriguing and she provides us with plenty of foreshadowing throughout the show, including foreshadowing regarding her origin. In spite of her lack of emotion, her interactions with the rest of the cast are interesting to watch and their feelings towards her tell you a lot about them. Much like everyone else, her layers are revealed later on as we get to see what her true motivations and emotions are and the show does an excellent job at making this feel natural and this is tricky to do as suddenly giving an emotionless character emotions can feel very contrived but the show avoids this through foreshadowing and hints.\nThe cast of this show is incredibly complex as all the major characters have backstories which make the way they act and think believable and realistic. All of the characters have motivations that are more complex than what they initially appear to be and their chemistry and interactions with the other characters is interesting as well as really believable. Overall the cast of this show is an achievement that shall likely go unrivalled for a long time.\nThe show’s animation is quite inconsistent and easily the show’s biggest flaw. At times (specifically the action scenes) the show can look absolutely incredible and able to rival some of the stuff coming out today but at other times it can be pretty damn lazy. The series was made on a low budget and it shows. It likes to cut corners and this is evident in scenes where a character’s mouth may be moving yet the rest of their body isn’t and scenes where one cell is used for a number of seconds. The art of the show on the other hand is excellent. Sadamoto’s character designs have their own unique flair while maintaining an obvious anime aesthetic.  \nThe show’s soundtrack is pretty fantastic. First there’s the iconic opening, Cruel Angel’s Thesis, which is easily one of my favourite openings of all time. It’s catchy, memorable and really quite powerful. The show’s ending track is the famous Fly Me to the Moon. Hold your horses guys it ain’t the Sinatra version, each episode has a different singer covering the classic song. These covers can range from really good to FUCKING ENGRISH. The show’s OST is absolutely brilliant too. It has some bombastic John Williams-esque orchestral pieces for the battle scenes, giving them a grand scale. The other tracks are great too, all of which are memorable in some way or other. The tracks can range from melancholic and somber to lighthearted and wacky, depending on the scene in question and the tracks fit their respective scenes to a tee.  The show’s Japanese voice track is excellent with actors portraying their characters wonderfully and expressing emotion very well. The English dub is a mixed bag however. Spike Spencer, Tiffany Grant and Amanda Winn Lee, the people who played Shinji, Asuka and Rei respectively, really have a grasp of the kind of characters they’re portraying. The same can be said about the rest of the cast. However, this being a 90s pre-Bebop dub some of the delivery is a tad cheesy, particularly from NERV’s ground crew (“Its an Angel!!!”). \nNot everyone will like Evangelion. It has a story that’s hard to follow at times, inconsistent animation and characters that some may find obnoxious. However it is something that all anime fans need to see due to its legacy and its impact on the medium of anime as a whole.  As for me I absolutely adore the series and consider it to be one of the all time greats. While many see a pretentious show about a whiny kid piloting a mecha, I see a wonderful coming of age story about a troubled kid learning about his place in the world.  "},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=163,  ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion is probably familiar to most of you. It's a well-known series from Gainax written by Anno Hideaki. It's also an anime I never got all the way through before this point. I tried several years before I wrote my first review when I was watching a bunch of anime because they had Hayashibara Megumi. I got through Nuku Nuku, Blue Seed, Saber Marionette, the Slayers, Love Hina, Bakuretsu Hunters and some others. Evangelion was the only series I couldn't get through. The characters annoyed me more than any cast I'd ever seen and the story was pants. In the end I got\n          \n        to that episode where Shinji and Asuka have to time their attacks using DDR, and no I don't know which episode that is numerically, and the sheer stupidity of that plot point resulted in my looking up the plot summaries for the remaining episodes to see if it was ever going to improve and promptly dropping it. \nMy ignoring the franchise ended last year when I was asked to review the film, End of Evangelion, which was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, I would rather watch one of Michael Bay's films than re-watch that. Now, I've been asked to go back and watch the series in its entirety and give it a chance. Honestly, I'm not looking forward to it. That being said, some of the series and films I've re-watched from that time period have turned out to be much better or worse than I remember. So, Evangelion could end up being better than my memory indicates. I certainly hope so because otherwise this is going to be painful. Let's take a look and see. \nStory:\nIn the far off year of 2015, fifteen years after the second impact cataclysm, mankind finds itself under siege by beings called “Angels.” Our protagonist, Shinji, is assigned to pilot a giant robot called an Eva and fight against the angels. Otherwise, a third impact could come and destroy everything. Unbeknownst to him, the organisation he's working for is keeping secrets that could be more destructive than the angels. \nNow, you might think setting the initial event that kicks off your story a scant five years in the future, the series started running in 1995, is absolutely moronic and just serves to make it horribly dated very quickly, but it has to be set in 2000. You see, Anno was making a satirical statement about the fact that government agencies used to lie. I know, shocking. \nSome might also call the writing weak for minor details like the angels having no real motivation, the NERV organisation being more transparently evil than a Captain Planet villain, the narrative grinding to a halt halfway through and never reaching any kind of real resolution or the ending in general. The people who say this just don't get the deeper meaning behind all of these factors. The angels have to be depicted as having no motivation because giving them motivations would make NERV's transparent evil too obvious. NERV has to be transparently evil because government agencies used to lie. The story has to grind to a halt to illustrate that life doesn't always have neat resolutions. You might argue that a narrative needs a sensical resolution but that's just nitpicking. \nCharacters:\nIn a world where most media tries to have characters who are endearing, complex, realistic or some combination thereof, Evangelion makes the bold decision of having characters who are none of those things. These are characters who are all of a quarter-dimensional. Sure, in a series like Highschool of the Dead or Crime Edge having characters that basic would hurt the narrative, but Evangelion pulls it off ingeniously. You see, Anno adds depth by giving virtually every character severe parent issues. You might think that sounds absolutely horrendous and annoying, but it's not. It's ingenious. \nArt:\nI will grant that the art is not great, even by the standards of its time. That being said, there are some very clever artistic choices. Like making most of the angels look like rejected super sentai villains. There's also the daring decision to show fourteen year old girls naked. It might sound pervy, but it is very essential to the underlying themes. \nSound: \nHayashibara Megumi and Ogata Megumi are two of the greatest actresses ever to grace the industry. Hayashibara Megumi might even be the best voice actress in any language ever. In addition to these powerhouses, Evangelion has Miyamura Yuko, Mitsuishi Kotono, Ishida Akira and several other talented people. With such a talented cast, Evangelion made the intrepid decision to have none of them act. It might sound like inexcusably bad direction, but it's very important to the themes that each actor only gets allocated one or two emotions. The music is pretty good. \nHo-Yay:\nThe ho-yay factor is a 2/10. There's a little bit between Shinji and Kaworu. \nFinal Thoughts: \nFor the one person out there who didn't pick up on the sarcasm in the preceding paragraphs, I'll say it clearly. This is one of the worst anime I've ever seen. The writing is horrid, using several elements that could be good if very well written but with all of them being handled completely incompetently. The characters are less than one-dimensional, thoroughly unlikable, and downright obnoxious. They neither act nor talk like anything remotely resembling a real person. I apologise to everyone, myself included, who has an actual depressive disorder since so many people offensively excuse the terribly written Shinji as just “being depressed.” The art would be middling, even with the ridiculous looking enemies, except for the gratuitous teenage nudity because the artists are pervy assholes. They got a stellar cast, which went entirely to waste. About the only positive element is that the music is actually pretty good. \nNow, I know someone is going to tell me I didn't get the “deeper meaning” behind the pretentious twaddle, so I looked up what Anno had to say about it. Which is that there is no deeper meaning in Evangelion. So, why exactly do people think there's a deeper meaning here? Allow me to explain. \nFinding meaning in something like Evangelion is a type of Apophenia, or seeing patterns and connections where none exist. The fact is, a lot of people see things like random religious symbols or the moments inside what passes for a “mind” in Whiny, Blank Slate or Anger Issues, as proof that there's a hidden meaning. So, they look for what it could be and they find something that satisfies them. If you're looking for a deep meaning, you will find it, regardless of whether or not there actually is one. It doesn't matter if a series is meaningless, simple and straight-forward, random or downright stupid. \nAs an exercise, Let's revisit Kill La Kill, assuming that it has a deeper meaning instead of just being a dumb action series. The series is actually a cautionary tale about the misuse of, and over-reliance on technology. It makes the brilliant move of using clothing, one of the most basic elements of our modern society, for this endeavour. It presents a nuanced approach, having clothing used both for good and ill. I could point to scenes like Mako and her family being corrupted by opulence only to discard their clothing and emerge as a noble poor family again. Sure, you could probably poke holes in this idea if you've seen the actual show, but the point is that it's ridiculously easy to construct your own meaning, especially if you're convinced that there is one. \nThe final rating, 1/10. To paraphrase a writer with actual talent, if the word “hate” was engraved on every atom of my body, it would not be a billionth of the hate I have for this series. It's downright atrocious and it was painful to sit through to the extent that you could force people to watch it as a method of torture. Next week, All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku. I need to read some Alan Moore to try and fix the damage the idiocy inherent to this pile of rancid fecal matter did to my brain cells. \n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=159,  ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion is perhaps the most popular anime of all time, trumping the majority of anime franchises, and is often considered to be the best anime of all time. Needless to say, it isn't. Not even close. Although it certainly had the potential to be, it just didn't live up to it. Which isn't to say Evangelion is bad, no. Evangelion is actually very good in many, many ways. The problem is, it counteracts this by having some horrible problem in another way.\nThe premise of Evangelion is set in 2015, set 15 years after the apocolypse, or \"2nd Impact\" wiped out half of humanity.\n          \n        I do love when a show claims Judgement Day will happen in the near-future, and gets ultimately proven wrong. At any rate, humanity is 15 years later being attacked by these things called \"Angels\", for some reason, and must kill them in giant robots called \"Evangelion\", to prevent 3rd Impact from happening. And so beings our vague story of vague vagueness.\nAnd what a vague story it is. Evangelion loves suspense like a fat kid loves twinkies, and will throw in 5 plot twists and/or questions per episode, without answering any of the present ones. It kicks off being something of a Monster-of-the-week thing, and does stick to the formula over the course of the next 26 episodes, but at the same time doing it, and pretty much everything else, completely different to anything and everything that has come before or since. Our normal plot is cut inbeetween with bizzare symbolism and obscure Biblical references, as well as the occassional Navel-gazing episode, which are usually a mental and visual mindfuck, and often very, very disturbing.\nHorror is a genre that isn't used very much in anime, and while Evangelion is very much a Sci-Fi show, it becomes more horrific than anything i've seen in any horror movie. Nothing regularly associated with the genre comes close to being as sickening and disturbing as some of the thing you'll see in Evangelion, which I will avoid stating for the sake of massive spoilers. But all of these add to what Gainax does best: Immersion. I don't think i'd be overstating it to say that Evangelion is the most emmersive, involving anime there has ever been, and you genuinely feel an attachment to this world and its inhabitants. Except Asuka. I could rant for a loooooong time about why I hate Asuka, but let's just say she's an irritating bitch who has a large amount of reverse character development.\nSpeaking of the characters, the characterization falls into a weird void wherein I can't honestly decide if they were lazily written or perfectly formed. While some of them become unbearably whiny, uninteresting, bitchy, or downright twisted, don't real people often fall to the same pitfalls? I've known plenty of people like Asuka in my time, although none of them quite so fucked up, and I can honestly see a lot of realism in that. Although there is one character I will say was undeniably fantastic, which makes the fact that he appears for all of one episode all the more tragic - Kaworu. Whether or not he is a good character (a question very much up for debate for every single character in this show), every moment he is on screen is a joy, providing a strange kind of relief much akin to what he actually does in-story. And probably moreso to fangirls... I can imagine a million of them squeeing over that one particular scene in the shower. You know the one.\nProduction-wise, the show is a very large up-and-down case. Artistically, the style is likeable and unique, and really brings something to the show. However, the animation is full of enormous and blatant corner-cutting. I am willing to forgive this to some extent, though, in that it was used to interesting artistic merit. The soundtrack is a strong, memorable affair, with several vivid tracks that remain easy to associate with the series. The English dub is a strange mix of realism and annoyance, but it has to be credited in that you really can't imagine them sounding any different, something the Rebuild movies have very much proven.\nBut here's the show's enourmous downfall. You remember those aformentioned plot threads? The ones they introduced in bulk per episode? None of them are resolved. None. Not even a single one. The movie \"End of Evangelion\" makes a passable attempt at fixing that, but there's no fixing the unbridled fury that thing that calls itself an ending will doubtlessly induce.\nBut truly, any complaint I have is somewhat irrelevant, because you HAVE to see Evangelion. There is no other series like it, and it will always be a cult thing, but there's no way to know if you'll like it until you watch it, with Evangelion being one of the most polarizing shows there has ever been.\nFinal Words:\nA must see, regardless of its many faults.\nAnimation/Graphics: 4/10\nStory/Plot: 7/10\nMusic/Background: 8/10\nEnglish Dub: 5/10\nOverall: 5/10 (make it 7/10 for the first 24 episodes, but those last two bring the score down HARD.)\nFor Fans Of: RahXephon, Serial Experiments Lain.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=143,  ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion.\nJust by saying that name, almost any anime fan will go into an extremely cautious silence. The weight of that series, among fans and haters alike, cannot be underestimated, as it's influence on the anime industry and anime fans is enormous; chances are that even if you hate the series, you can't deny it's positive influence on the anime industry, considering that chances are that you may even have something that was influenced by this series on your favorites, even if you immensely dislike the series in question.\nNow, my opinion is a fairly different one from the vast majority of people who watch\n          \n        this series. I'm already seeing a plethora of \"Not Helpful\" votes just by giving Evangelion the score I did, considering Evangelion is often referred to as a series that is either considered well above average among the greatest achievements in the history of anime (which it is, in a certain sense) or a complete pile of pretentious garbage that a pack of elitist wannabes hype to drill into the heavens that is unworthy of being compared to the series it influenced.\nIn any case, enough of me talking about that and onto the review:\nStory (5/10):\nI'm already seeing eyebrows being raised. But let me clarify something before I give my opinion: I am aware that Evangelion is meant to be a deconstruction of the mech genre. I am aware of the various themes it was trying to handle, ranging from Freudian psychology to Christian symbolism to the Hedgehog's dilemma to Social Darwinism (to some extent, anyway).\nEverything I said sounds good, right? The series however, assumes instantly that you know all of these themes and will make sense of it if jumbled together, which leads to an extremely flawed and contradictory form of storytelling. \nAllow me to explain what I mean. Series should know how to show a story, while providing minimal, but necessary information in telling a story.\nThis series assumes that instead of telling a story, the viewers will make up the story for it, ruining most of the credibility the series  had going for it.\nAnd onto the show aspect; the series loves placing irrelevant symbolism at the wrong times.\nSuch as when the angels get defeated, a giant cross (or multiple giant crosses) with no meaning whatsoever appears.\nOr making characters act completely out of character and unrealistically (I'm looking at you, Asuka) just to emphasize it's themes, forgetting that if the viewer doesn't connect with the character in question, any point in it's themes are deemed irrelevant to the casual viewer.\nSeriously, this series could have done so much more with it's themes, but instead resorted to randomly tossing in big words and jumbling it's themes together in the hope something would make sense to the viewer, leaving a mildly interesting story with interesting ideas (with absolutely no idea how to execute them) and a miserable excuse for an ending that in my opinion doesn't make any sense whatsoever, although I'm not entirely sure how anyone can make sense of that ending personally even after watching End of Evangelion. But that's a review for another time.\n\nArt/Animation (6/10)\nThe artwork looks quite interesting and well-done for it's time, and the mech designs as well as the detailed Lovecraft-styled Angels look pretty damn good too. \nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said for the animation during most of the series, as it randomly fluctuates between looking absolutely gorgeous during action scenes to looking absolutely terrible most of the time. This lead to some rather...questionable scenes to say the least, including the ending, the infamous train scene and the countless times (No, for those who haven't seen it, I am not joking) character's mouths were covered and the frame would stay completely still for around 2 minutes.\nThe exceptional artwork is therefore put down by the extremely low quality, inconsistent animation, hence the low score.\nSound (7/10)\nDecent voice acting and soundtrack and an amazing opening.\nAll right! Everything is perfect! \nUntil we get to the classical music. No seriously, the classical music ruins the atmosphere so badly it's not even funny (OK, I jest, I find it bloody hilarious, especially in completely still scenes). Who's idea was it to randomly insert classical music in the hope people would make sense of it?\nIt loses what would've been a perfect or near-perfect score thanks to this problem I encountered.\nCharacter (4/10)\nWhere do I start?\nThe three children are all annoying, angst-ridden, irritating and serve later in the series as tools to advance the themes and plot of the story. The character that falls victim to this the most is Asuka, who has (mild spoilers) feelings for Shinji yet changes personality to be jealous of him off the drop of a hat, which emphasizes the theme in question in all the wrong ways.\nWe never discover the motives for some of the characters for acting as they did, which for several of these characters is a huge mistake considering how important they are to the advancement of the plot.\nA huge shout out however, to Misato Katsuragi, who was easily my favorite character and the most consistent and most lovable character of the show. Sure she has...problems, to say the least, but she is the only character who stops me from giving this section a lower score. If only all the characters were as well-written as her...\nEnjoyment (4/10):\nUltimately, I feel Evangelion is a completely average mech anime with interesting ideas but one of the poorest executions to those ideas, due to underdeveloped characters, ill-fitting music at times, low quality animation and lackluster storytelling, which I found greatly hampered the show's great moments and throw it off from what it could have been to complete mediocrity.\nOverall, I give this series a 5 out of 10. Lord have mercy on me.\nThank you for reading my review! Feedback is greatly appreciated!\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=140,  ["text"]="                          \n    Overhype, thy name is Evangelion.\nSince I started watching anime, it seemed that all anybody could do was talk about how amazing this show is. In a sense, they're right. When one watches this show, they must see it through a lens of how revolutionary Evangelion was at the time, and how largely it influenced anime. However, this review isn't about that. This review is about how enjoyable this anime is to watch. Evangelion is well-written, full of symbols, and smartly deconstructs the mecha genre; however, it is pretentious, at its best underwhelming, and at its worst a complete waste of time to watch.\nLet me preface\n          \n        this by saying that I am not a fan of the mecha genre. However, I was assured repeatedly by fans who swear by this show that this show is a psychological thriller at heart, and that the mecha aspect isn't very important. And with that, I feel misled. Between the lack of cliffhangers, the episodic plot structure, and the fairly predictable mecha fights, I was at times forcing myself to watch the next episode as I so dearly hoped that the next one would become more captivating and finally begin to shed light on why this show is so revered. Unsurprisingly, I was disappointed.\nSome would argue that the plot predictability comes from how much this show influenced future shows that I've probably already seen. Even if this were true, it doesn't fix the problem; it only shifts the blame around. Moreover, the episodic plots, predicable or not, still were not compelling in the slightest. This is the real issue, and regardless of what causes these issues, it doesn't change the fact that it makes the show far less entertaining.\nIronically, I liked the last two episodes more than the rest of the show combined. Perhaps it was because the writers couldn't use mecha battles and instead had to write some actually interesting and compelling character or philosophy-driven content. I won't get into detail as to what happens in them, but they were a breath of fresh air and a remarkable improvement to the series (even if their budget was nearly nonexistent at that point).\nEvangelion is a tricky case. Yes, the show is filled with symbolism and motifs and other such nonsense, but packing an otherwise mediocre series with symbolic imagery doesn't inexplicably improve the enjoyment of the show. Fans of this show berate others who didn't like it for not \"getting\" it, and that people who truly understood the show would love it. This variant of the No True Scotsman fallacy is the exact same thing that similar fans use to dismiss those who didn't like FLCL, and it's just as wrong. If you enjoy the mecha genre enough to see a deconstruction of it, and don't mind some predictability, Evangelion will be right up your alley. Otherwise, you are only wasting your time. \n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=137,  ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most iconic anime's in existence. For two decades NGE has been heavily endorsed and internationally touted by young and older anime viewers alike complete with impressive numbers by any standard on MAL. Watching NGE is an overall enjoyable experience and within a few days of finishing the series I felt myself missing several characters and even the OP. However, I did feel throughout watching the entire show that the reception it has received with these lofty ratings and rankings should be taken with discretion.\nThe show, I feel, is one that is best appreciated by the group. If you\n          \n        watch anime as a loner for your own benefit but never discuss it with others, then this series may not be for you. That is to say that this anime's strong points include its ability to branch off into fan fiction, openness to personal interpretations, and its overwhelming popularity which has led to constant outside references. Although it would be wrong to say you couldn't understand NGE by simply watching the show, it does rely heavily on implications and towards the end jumps from one scenario to the next abruptly. By the conclusion the viewer should read up on the back-story through other means to fully comprehend the non-explicitly stated or easily missed plot points.\nTo put it simply, NGE is ultimately an enjoyable yet extremely and intentionally bombastic series. This is where and how it allows for the immense amount of fan fiction, yet standalone the series is simply a face-value story. I have seen other reviewers delve deep into the apparent symbolism (specifically the religious aspects) of the show when in reality there is little to be had. The viewer is immediately introduced to the idea of Angels and then later on Adam, Lilith, along with a litany of other Christian expressions and names. Fans of the show have written extensive theories regarding the interrelations between these figures and their symbolic meanings.  However, when asked about them directly, the Assistant Director of the series Kazuya Tsurumaki was quoted saying that they had \"originally used Christian themes and symbolism only to give the project a unique edge against other giant robot shows, that there is no Christian meaning to the series and that it was not meant to be controversial.\" Overall, if you would like a show that will lead you to reading more about the anime outside of the episodes, one that will leave room for you to make your own theories on a particular aspect's significance NGE could be a good fit. If you want a show deliberately designed to incorporate intellectual symbolism or hidden meanings then you should look elsewhere.\nIf you are an anime lover and are a frequent visitor to anime communities, you will no doubt have been exposed to one or more of the Evangelion's cast. Personally I hold Misato Katsuragi, one of the main characters, as one of my favorite characters of all anime. She is without a doubt the most real of the cast members and has the most persistent character story within the show. Aside from her there is no real character progression per say, the viewer is slowly clued in to the true nature that has always existed within each character more so than the characters learn from their experiences and grow. Tensions build as these characters struggle with realizing their own identity and the show makes for a different style on the coming of age motif. Unfortunately most characters end up simply remaining or even intensifying their role as one sided caricatures of the trope they were originally introduced as.\nMany, including myself, say Steins;Gate truly takes it's time to get into the meat of the action and relies on a large number of episodes for set up. Neon Genesis Evangelion arguably takes even longer to come into its own. Once it's pacing finally sees an increase it also seems to rush itself to fit everything possible into what little amount of episodes they had left for broadcast. As the anime begins to come to its conclusion, the writers implement several incredibly deus ex machina and convenient plot points that allow for the shows rapid development but more highlight the staff's lack of foresight. Additionally, it still confuses me how an anime so highly rated can have its final episodes be so poorly done and poorly received by the public that it needed to have a theatrical release to re-write the action for an alternate finale. The story would be best described as alright but can still be interesting given the proper mindset for the show. It's ambiguous enough to allow for those who want to go deeper to be able to, clear enough to understand where it's going even if not everything is explained.\nThemes can hit hard in NGE yet are more tropes than anything else. You will see overwhelming amounts of pacifism from several characters to the point where it becomes irritatingly redundant and occasionally bizarrely inane. It is a problem in many anime where they have a deluded character with an estranged sense of righteousness that has no problem with allowing hundreds of their closest family and friends die as long as they themselves as a single character don't have to feel the guilt of cutting short the life of a single enemy. You will also find the ancillary character who, while prepping for and participating within a war, exclaiming they don't want to kill people. The most prevalent and persistent theme however would be the question \"what makes a person human?\" This anime is first and foremost an elaborate identity crisis for each character. Are they themselves when they are forced to make decisions against their will, does doing the right thing by conventionally bad methods mean they are a bad person, what is the meaning of their existence or even of man’s origins in general, are they defined by the connections they have with others, are their entire beings in existence to prove something to someone else or are their internal drives truly intrinsic? Each character will break down into some form of trying to understand themselves rather than trying to improve a self they already understand.  Unfortunately I would say that the majority of the questions posed go unanswered or are poorly concluded within the anime itself.\nThe art of the show can be impressive, especially when compared to other anime of its time. Its colors are usually vibrant, its animation is typically smooth, and there isn't too much re-use of older frames. The art is one of the stronger points within the show itself as it portrays everyone throughout their lives within a real light yet still with the distinctive anime proportions. During flashbacks the characters can look notably different and younger while still retaining their individual identity.\nPersonally, I found the soundtrack for the show to be pleasing as well. The opening theme always got me into the mood for just one more show even if I wasn't exactly satisfied with the plot development in the previous episode. The sounds are all realistic as well as fit the tone and mood of the show.\nOverall, this show is one that should be taken for what it is: a popular show with great potential to expand upon. Shinji is a weak willed protagonist who even with the proper influences around him still fails to comprehend the situation he finds himself in. While some defense can be made given his young age, as a viewer it becomes difficult to continue to watch a character go through the exact same problems week-in week-out without much progression towards improving his character's mindset. The story can be fun for viewers who enjoy shows as they come and don't worry about the unexplained nature of action buzzword themes such as NGE's use of 'berserkers' or the lack of detail for much of the driving forces behind the majority of the cast in terms of why they fight the angels. Most of the series showcases a dedicated group blindly fighting an unknown enemy out of the idea of self-preservation which could be seen as a symbolic theme of the necessity to understand each other, however such symbolism is ruined when a major character makes a nearly nonsensical and again unexplained monologue about how only one life form, humans or angels, can exist on Earth at the given time. \nThe plotline is enjoyable and even if it's not exactly surprising, it still takes twists and turns along the way. Its animation is clean, its soundtrack is good and it is a nice reference anime. As an anime I reviewed it as a 6 while personally I enjoyed it. It is better than your run of the mill anime although more popular than it is technically sound. Its popularity has led to its great fan fiction potential and after almost 2 decades still retains many raving fans. NGE also includes several rebuild movies in addition to the series and alternate ending.\nI recommend this anime for those who like to watch or discuss anime in groups, would like the understand references made to one of the most popular anime series of all time, or fans of the mecha genre. If you are looking for a well-constructed anime with consistent pacing, no plot holes/deus ex machina, or no emphasis on following up through additional reading or movie-watching then NGE is not for you. It is neither a confusing anime nor one that is hard to understand simply one lacking in explanation within the confines of the episodes themselves.\n        "},

It's a show every anime fan knows of. \nAlthough I've known this show for quite a while I needed the help of the Internet and some dank ironic meme pages to go an actually give it a shot. \nNGE starts off like almost any other typical Mecha anime you see these days but soon transcends all the barriers any anime at the\n          \n        time had the audacity to. We get into the show with a 14-year old teenager named Shinji Ikari, who is called over to a mysterious organization \"NERV\" who is fighting beings known as the \"Angels\" who are trying to invade the city of Tokyo. \nWhile the storyline doesn't seem to be legendary in any way, it's the characters that are one of the strongest points of success for Neon Genesis Evangelion. Below is the list of four of the main characters in the show.\nRei Ayanami: The first child to pilot the Eva Unit 00, Rei seems to be a cold and a character with little emotions and doesn't get along with people at first. She is seen for the first time in the starting episode of Evangelion as she is rescued by Shinji following a shake when an Angel attacks.\nShinji Ikari: The main protagonist of the show, Shinji is a 14-year old kid who is summoned to pilot Eva Unit 01 and is the third child to do so. Throughout the entire show, Shinji is depicted as a very isolated person who fears being alone and who believes he has no sense of self-worth whatsoever. If I do say so myself, Shinji is one of the most relatable characters in the entire anime history.\nMisato Katsuragi: FANSERVICE. The one thing Misato's character is for for almost the entire show. Although quite cheerful and enigmatic, Misato's backstory is quite similar to that of Shinji's. As a young kid, she was saved from her Father from the Angels, and whom she hated for not spending and caring for his family. She then joins NERV in order to take her revenge and defeat the Angels for good. Oh and she's also the guardian of Shinji while they both work for NERV.\nAsuka Langley Soryu: Asuka is mostly like Misato, enigmatic, cheerful and quite arrogant. She's the second child and the pilot of the Eva Unit 02. Asuka is the exact opposite of Shinji. Confident in herself and the things she does, but also gets along quite well with Shinji. Both have a pretty good relationship in the series before Asuka moves into a depressive state because of losing the lead spot to Shinji as Eva's pilot.\nAsuka's childhood is pretty dark, where she lost her mother at a very young age and since has taken an oath to herself as to never cry and depend on others. She's the type of character either you love the most or hate to the core. Much like the anime itself.\nConsidering Neon Genesis Evangelion came out in 1994, the art is pretty nice and packs a punch. Although at times it gets really underwhelming, a good example is the last two episodes of the show. Other than that, the art done by Gainax is fine and watchable to say the least. \n\"A Cruel Angel's Thesis\" is a true classic and stands out throughout the show. You'll never get tired of hearing it and it's still one of the greatest opening theme songs ever made to date. The soundtrack of Neon Genesis Evangelion is really good. The battle themes, slow paced scenes and almost in any other part of the show it's well done. The ending, \"Fly Me To The Moon\" is a classic ending as well. It has multiple versions, even for the characters like Asuka and Rei, which perfectly suits the personality of the characters and also that certain episode. \nAll in all, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a classic and a joy to watch. Although a deconstruction of the Mecha genre, which is the first of its kind and not suitable for everyone, this still stands out as one of the most influential anime's to this day.\nAs of now writing this review, I'd like to mention that I have yet to watch The End of Evangelion, which is the true conclusion of the controversial episodes 25 and 26, the show still did enough for me. Even if I don't watch EoE(Which I will of course) the ending was satisfying although it did not completely tell some of the plotholes left in the series such as \"What is the Dead Sea scrolls?\", \"What are the Angels actually?\", \"What's the human instrumentality project?\".\nAnd since I'm a good guy I'd like to give the people who have yet to watch the series a piece of advice: Go into watching Neon Genesis Evangelion in a positive way and don't overhype it. If you do that you might actually enjoy the series for what it is."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=112,  ["text"]="\n\n\nSTORY:\nNeon Genesis Evangelion... one of the most controvercial animes of all times, with legions of determined fans and legions of convinced haters this is one anime that hasn't gone by without leaving some feelings behind and so how can we not recognize it's value.\n There are a lot of guys that say Evangelion was a great mecha/action anime for it's time but the confusing and boring ending and the fact that Sinji is a very weak character pulled down the anime... in my opinion they just didn't get the show at all... that is the beauty of NGE, the story is to deep for some\n          \n        to appreciate for a reason, I'll give you a hint... it doesn't have anything to do with robots, fighting, love, or heroes...\nNGE is actually a story that uses action, mecha and pseudo-religious symbolism to advance philosophical and psychological depictions and theories about the concept of freedom, self determination, decision and responsability, about the final stage of human evolution and human nature of the dark side, anxiety, the relation between the individual and society, the relation between humans and divinity... all hidden in an seemingly insane but yet very logic story. It can be compared with a complex spider web, a labyrinth. What is interesting in my opinion is that the story doesn't threat you as a fool by throwing the clues in your face, it just shows you a glimpse of it without focusing, it lets you think and put pieces together, and you slowly start to discover new things and form new theories and you soon realize how really extraordinary the anime really is and how much thought, planning and calculation was put into it to make it so complex and mysterious.. and in the end the anime makes you form your own conclusion, your own ending using your own free will.\n It incorporates many of Freud's ideas (the father of modern psychology) such as 'hedgehog dilemma','oedipus complex','separation anxiety','thanatos','oral stage' which can be seen in the characters actions, especially Sinji, Asuka, Rei, Misato and Ritsuko.\nFrom the philosophic point it deals with the question posed by many great minds over the centuries, what is  the human, what is freedom and what is the final stage of evolution, confronting the SEELE's plans (which have clearly an idealist Friedrich Hegel philosophy) against the existentialist view os J.P. Sartre and Kierkegaard... for those who don't know Hegel, Sartre and Kierkegaard are all famous philosophers... the ideea of Human Instrumentality Project is also inspired from Arthur C. Clarke's novel 'Childhood's End'.\nFor more just check Evangelion of Wikipedia and you'll be amazed how interesting this anime really is if you have some culture and brains to actually see it's real meanings.\nAnimation:\nThe animation still is decent even after almost 10 years and the Eva fights can still impress you, and i really wouldn't imagine characters like Sinji, Asuka, Rei or Misato in any other form.\nSound:\nVoice acting is one of it's strong points, the script has some very hard to play out lines and emotions, but as all the seyuus are some of the most experienced ones out there, we get as a result one of the best and most emotional voice acting ever, Oscar worthy for shure.. a great example of that are Sinji and Misato. The music containing mostly classic music also fits every scene and every emotion, and if you have the surround version you couldn't ask for more than this.\nCharactes:\nThe characters are just great, none are perfect, none are good or bad, this isn't a black and white story, all characters have good points and bad points, complex feelings and personalities, most have a tragic past that still haunts them, that has a huge toll on their present, emotional wounds that would never heal. So much lonliness, so much despair, dissapointment, hate and passion. Some are like the storm some like a leaf in a storm but they are all going fast on the one way road to destruction... Trully memorable characters... And for all those who claim to hate Sinji cos he's a coward, and prefer an unrealistic Naruto like kid that has unmeasurable courage in impossible situations, I have to remind them that this is a SERIOUS ANIME where chars act like real humans.\nValue:\nThis is a true classic that any anime fan has to have a real jewel among all SF and psycho animes. We can all accept it's contribution to the anime kind and we know about the copies that appeared after it. Nowbody can remain cold and without feelings after this anime, either you'll love it or hate it, you'll consider it a masterpiece of a genious or the dangerous work of an insane person, you'll still remember it and you'll have to respect it.\n"},

Something along the lines of say Gundam Wing or old school anime like Mazinger Z, with a battle-a-new-monster-every-episode type structure. Don't get me wrong it has all the elements that made those types of anime enjoyable (i.e. its still has something of a monster every week element), but it has has so much more to it than that.\nBasically the story is set up as follows: It's 2015, Ikari Shinji is a wimpy little kid called to Tokyo-3 by his father (Ikari Gendo). Shinji's relationship with is father is\n          \n        somewhat distant and Shinji in fact hates his father. Prior to this Shinji lived with his teacher. As it tuns out, Shinji has been summoned by his father to an organisation called NERV where he has been selected as the \"Third Child\" and is required to pilot a mecha called an Evangelion, specifically Eva Unit-01. Anyway by sudden coincidence just as Shinji has been asked to join NERV and pilot the Eva, the third Angel ( a random alien monster that seemingly appears out of no where) starts attacking Tokyo-3. This is the first Angel attack since an event called \"Second Impact\", of course at this point it's time for Shinji to pilot the Eva and stop the attack.\nNow as I progressed through the series I found myself watching an assortment of characters that all defied the cliche of a lot of anime/TV in general. I found the character's to have realistic flaws and problems (albeit exaggerated true to anime form), but I found myself caring about what happened to the characters. Although most of the time I just wanted to give Shinji a punch in the face, but he's deliberately put there to annoy you in my opinion, he is unlike any other main character in the sense that you are glad you are not him, as opposed to say Kurosaki Ichigo from Bleach where you perhaps wouldn't mind being him ^_^.\nAs a final point: the score is by Sagisu Shiro (the same guy who scored Bleach) but may I add that although it is no where as good as Bleach's score, its does the job, hence why I gave it an 8 (because I know Sagisu can do better :P).\nTo sum up, I generally give this series (i.e. the story) a 9, but I seriously recommend watching the movie \"End of Evangelion\" straight after watching the series for better finalisation of the story. Along with the movie, the whole Evangelion \"experience\" gets a 10 in my view.\nAngus"},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=90,   ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion is the worst anime I've ever watched, and let me tell you why. First of all, the character development. Shinji remains stagnant throughout the entirety of the show as a scared little boy, with no balls. He never comes to realize the responsibility he has, and instead simply acts immature for the sake of seeming realistic. Asuka is an arrogant bully suffering under a depression after having a messed up childhood; and Rei is more of a robot than a character. Other side characters like Gendo and Misato do receive some nice backstories however, that doesn't help the weak main cast.\nThe story\n          \n        is average at best, consisting of episodic monster of the week battles against angels. Later it is revealed why this is so, all being a lead-up to Gendo's plan of human instrumentality, but it doesn't change how weak and un-engaging the story is, and human instrumentality is just an excuse for the last episodes to exist.\nThe art isn't very good, the aspect ratio is small, and the animation quality is really inconsistent. The music is nothing special either. Thankfully the action scenes are very intense and help make the series very addicting (I marathoned it in two days).\nThe big things that absolutely ruin this show for me are the horrible characters, the Gainax ending, and an uninteresting story. In some areas, like action, this show was pretty good. After watching this, I felt disgusted for having wasted my time with this series, it truly deserves a 1/10 from me.\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=103,  ["text"]="                          \n    WARNING: This is going to be a very long review, as there's a lot of content to cover.  Bear with me, please.  Also, note that I watched the remastered version of the series, and the Revival of Evangelion (which contained only the Death segment of Death and Rebirth, combined with the End of Evangelion).  Also, this review may contain some SPOILERS.\nTitle: Neon Genesis Evangelion\nManga, Anime: Neon Genesis Evangelion has, at this point, three manga incarnations.  The first, which shares the same title as the anime, was released to drum up interest for the anime TV series, though originally publishers thought that\n          \n        it was too out-of-date to actually earn money.  It was authored by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (famous for his character designs for the .hack series and The Girl Who Leapt Through Time), and began serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's Shonen Ace in the February 1995 issue (actually released on December 26th, 1994), and is still running at this point in time.  Viz has licensed it Stateside, and it stands at 10 volumes of the 11 currently published volumes, with a total of 12 volumes planned.  The second, Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days, is an alternate retelling of Evangelion, using the high school romantic comedy scenario shown briefly in Episode 25 and expanded upon in the video game Neon Genesis Evangelion: Girlfriend of Steel 2.  It was authored by Fumino Hayashi (who is also working on a Terra E spinoff called Aoki Kobo no Kiss for Square Enix), and was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Asuka from the November 2003 issue to the November 2005 issue.  It has been licensed Stateside by ADV Manga, and ran in Newtype USA from the August 2005 issue to the January 2006 issue, and the sixth and final volume was released on August 31st of 2007.  The newest incarnation, Neon Genesis Evangelion: Gakuen Datenroku, focuses on Shinji's attending NERV Academy, and being roped into helping the Samash Guardians (Rei, Kaoru, and Asuka) find and protect Cores, which are gems that, if they fall into the hands of Angels (which are only consciousnesses, not actual physical beings) will end up in humanity's destruction.  It's authored by Min Min, and began serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Asuka in the October 2007 issue, and is still ongoing.  It also has yet to be licensed Stateside.\nAt this point in time, Neon Genesis Evangelion has four anime incarnations, three of which are movies and will be covered later in this review.  Neon Genesis Evangelion's original anime incarnation was a twenty-six episode series that ran on Japanese TV from October 4th, 1995 to March 27th, 1996.  It was produced by Gainax (famous for their work on His and Her Circumstances and FLCL), and directed by Hideaki Anno (famous for his work on the original Gunbuster OVA and His and Her Circumstances).  It has been licensed Stateside by ADV films, and the latest remastered box set was released on November 22nd, 2005.\nStory: After not seeing or hearing from his father for several years, Shinji Ikari is summoned to Tokyo-3, Japan's new capital after the original capital was nuked in the chaos after the Second Impact, which was caused by a meteorite slamming into Antartica, killing off about half of the world's population, submerging a good deal of the continents, and tilting the Earth's axis, which caused major climate change.  He is then ordered by his father to reluctantly pilot a robot known as the Evangelion Unit 01 in order to defeat a strange invaders known as Angels.\nSo, yeah.  Sounds fairly generic, right?  And for about the first half of the show, Evangelion is not really anything new in the post-apocalyptic mecha genre.  Episodes are, for the most part, either Shinji angsting about piloting the Eva or a monster of the week episode, and you can start to predict what's going to happen after a few rinse and repeats.  The characters that are introduced are all fairly messed up, and you might form attachments to them, but it's not enough to really keep you interested.  I was seriously considering dropping it at about the halfway point.\nAnd then the second half of the show hit, and it hit hard.\nThe second half starts to focus more on the psychological aspects of the characters, and the truth behind NERV and its goals.  You knew before that these characters were messed up, but now you get to find out just how messed up they are.  And the unfolding mysteries behind NERV and the Evas are nothing short of amazing.  It also gets a lot more violent and sexual.\nThe reason that this change happened was partially because it was already in mind, but had to do a lot with what was going on behind the scenes.  At this point in time, Anno was suffering from severe depression, and you can see it reflected in the show and its characters.  Also, right around this time, funding for the show was starting to run out, and they were failing to meet deadlines.\nAnd, then, of course, there's the infamous Episodes 25 and 26.\nOddly enough, the original ending, while it didn't address any of the issues and mysteries that had built up over the last half of the show, was actually kind of satisfying to me.  It shows the actual process of Instrumentality, even though it doesn't really explain what it is, and it ends up being a kind of cracked-out therapy session for the major characters of the show as they take part in Instrumentality.\nAlso, know going into this that there's a lot of psychology and philosophy and religious symbolism in here, that, if you know it, will definitely help with your understanding of the show.  On the other hand, if you don't, be sure to keep Google up, or see if you can find a version of the show with the equivalent of footnotes.\nOverall, the story's a bit dense, a bit generic for the first half or so, and doesn't really resolve its issues, but, once it gets to the second half, it kicks into high gear and doesn't look back.\nWARNING: As you get into the second half of the show, there's a lot of graphic violence and gore, and offscreen sexual happenings.  Be aware of this going in.\nArt: Compared to other shows that were airing roughly around this time (Fushigi Yuugi and Sailor Moon SuperS and StarS), the animation, for most of the show, is pretty good.  The designs for the Evas and Angels are amazingly varied and just amazing to look at in general, as are the character designs and the way the battles are done.\nThere's a fairly obvious dip in quality towards the end of the show, but, again, that has to do with the fact that they were unable to meet deadlines and were running out of funding for the project in general.  Though I have to admit that they did come up with fairly creative ways to work around the lack of budget, even if some of them could probably cause seizures.\nMusic: The music for Evangelion is done by Shiro Sagisu and is one of those soundtracks that sticks in your head and one that you actively notice throughout the show, like I did with Gankutsuou, Bokurano, and Code Geass.  I'd say some of these themes are probably some of the most recognizable from any anime.  And there are some classical themes that end up being used for background music in some of the more EPIC moments of the show, which only helps the moment.\nThe OP, 'Cruel Angel's Thesis', is amazingly catchy.  And the ED, a cover of 'Fly Me To The Moon', has several different variations that are used, depending on which episode it is.\nAll in all, awesome music.\nSeiyuu: There are some fairly well-known seiyuu in here.  Misato's seiyuu, Kotono Mitsuishi (aka the voice of Sailor Moon and Juri Arisugawa in Revolutionary Girl Utena), Shinji's seiyuu, Megumi Ogata (aka the voice of Sailor Uranus), Rei's seiyuu, Megumi Hayashibara (aka the voice of Atsuko Chiba and the title character in Paprika and Lina Inverse in the Slayers series), and Aoba's seiyuu, Takehito Koyasu (aka the voice of Touga in Revolutionary Girl Utena and Hotohori in Fushigi Yuugi) all do excellent jobs for thier characters, and it's nice to see them in this production.\nLength: Overall, pretty good.  It doesn't feel like it drags in any places, though, realistically, they could've cut out some of the filler at the beginning.  They didn't really address all of the mysteries of the show, but, then again, that's what the three movies are for.  Still, twenty-six episodes is pretty solid.\nOverall: An excellently scored and seiyuued show that starts out generic, but, with budget cuts, deadline issues, and the depression of the director in the second half, takes the story into new, violent, symbolic places, even if the quality of the art goes down a bit and the ending doesn't quite resolve things.  \nAll in all?  A fairly solid series.\nStory: 8/10\nArt: 7/10\nMusic: 9/10\nSeiyuu: 9/10\nLength: 8/10\nOverall: 41/50; 82% (B)\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=88,   ["text"]="                          \n    Unlike most I came into Neon Genesis Evangelion without getting caught up in lots of hype so certain aspects this anime were not ruined and therefore more shocking. Since then I've come to know that the anime fans are divided between praise and hatred of this anime due its nature. Anyway let’s gets this review underway.\nStory- 8.1\nThe story revolves around the trials and tribulations of 14 year old boy by the name of Shinji Ikari and his massive mech, known as EVA Unit-1,who fight for NERV, a human organisation, in order to prevent the end of the world occurring in an event known as the\n          \n        ‘Third Impact’. For most of the episodes he and his \"friends\",piloting other EVAs, fight weird and wonderful creatures called, somewhat ironically, \"Angles\". However, there is more here than meets the eye initially. As you peel back the layers of Evangelion you see that there is a conspiracy of biblical proportions, unveiled slowly with the degeneration of Shinji's psyche, and a deconstruction of the mech genre. But with all these elements and ideas being converged the plot itself loses some of the brilliant substance it began with and begins to derail, culminating at the ending.\nThis is where many fans of the original anime were divided. Some saw it is a very good psycho-analysis of Shinji, whilst most saw it as a massive departure of tone from what the anime was originally built on and what made in their eye enthralling. I can respect the earlier view, but I find myself wishing that they had done it in less radical method. On the whole the story and plot was very good and highly enthralling at times but the story took blow due to the ending and the number of layers which were attempted to be implemented within it.\nArt- 6.9\nThe animation for Eva was done by Studio Gainax. The animation quality does not really hold up with anything recently but for things made in the 1995 it is very good. However the throughout the anime we can see evidence of the tight animation budget that Gainax had. On occasions the level of detail dropped and the fluidity of the movements becomes fragmented. At other times all things in the anime stop moving for minutes at a time. But the worst offender is the last two episodes which we lose all sense of the word animation and turn into lines scribbled across a page. Even with all these flaws and idiosyncrasies the animation for the whole series was good with the battle scenes being executed very well.\nSound- 8.5(Soundtrack-9.1 and Voice Acting-7.9)\nThe OST for Eva is very good with each track more than adequately, in some cases exquisitely, fitting the mood and the setting which is on screen. The OP and ED are brilliant, even if the ED is cover, and are extremely memorable. If there is any qualms that I have with the OST it is the there is slight repetition in the usage of each track but on the whole it is a quite excellent OST.\nThe Dub, in the other hand, is a completely different matter altogether. Initially a lot of the lines feel very forced and the cast seem to struggle to fit into their characters roles. This uneasiness fades away the further that we go into the anime. Eventually the cast fit their roles very well and deliver their lines to great amounts of effect. However it is the initial harshness that detracts from the overall quality of the acting.\nCharacter- 9.4\nThis is where Eva comes into its own. The characters are what set this anime apart from all of the “copycats” that have come out after its release. I have heard many people complain about the about this aspect of Eva but this is where the most of my enjoyment comes from. Each decision, each reaction, each emotion and each interaction reeks of reality which creates a cast of characters who are human to their very core. Yes, like most, I wish Shinji would grow a backbone every once in a while but does this mean I hate him, maybe, but, for me, it creates a very interesting character who can be looked into and analysed with great depth. And the thing is you could do this with every character in Eva as they all have their own psychological issues ranging from parental issues to isolation to love, or lack of it. It is this great depth and variety that interests me and makes me love watching Eva and greatly immerses me in this fictional world.\nEnjoyment- 9.3\nI loved watching nearly every minute of Eva, notice the “nearly”. The action sequences were entertaining and the plot was interesting, albeit a bit convoluted. However, as mentioned above, it is the characters that really sold Eva to me and made my enjoyment the level that it is. The only part of this anime that detracts from my enjoyment is the final two episodes, which greatly reduced my immersion. Nonetheless this is a series that I had no regrets in watching.\nOverall- 8.44\nEva is a series of many layers and does require some heavy concentration at some points. But the satisfaction that one should get out of this series, in most cases, is diminished by the execution of the final two episodes. However if you are looking for an anime which has great psychoanalysis of characters I will tell you to look no further than Neon Genesis Evangelion.\nThank you for reading my review and I hope it was Helpful. Also any feedback would be greatly appreciated =D"},

At least there she had a hint of a relationship with Shinji.\nThe rest of the cast is hit or miss\nGendo's motivations are confusing,he's less likeable than his manga counterpart as well\nRitsuko tacked-on backstory feels silly\nThe kids,toji and the one with the glasses are ok,whoever decided to kill Toji in the manga deserves a punch to the face.\nKaji is still a womanizer but we dont see a lot of him really\nMisato  instead,comes off as a better character on the series,we delve more into her relationship both Shinji and Kaji,she has motivations,she cares,she's just a woman in a storm of crazy confusing plots\nThe story for the most part,is a generic mecha monster of the week show with a mystery ,while some questions are answered,most of them are not,at least not in a clear fashion self concluding way,\nWhat do i mean by this,see,the  creators made such a mess of a series that they sometimes answer questions of the series in conferences,which are then spewed out by fans,\nTo me,this isnt satisfactory at all,a series shouldnt have its questions answered outside of it,its like buying a ticket for a ride and instead someone's telling you what happens in the ride\nBack to the series,its mostly episodic just right before the ending we get some good drama,but it gets undercut because of budget problems and the series shows it specially in one scene in episode 23 or 24\nThere's a scene where it tooks a whole minute to move out of a frame,I couldnt believe it,what a cheap way to fill time,there's another where it's a thirty second wait,there's half an episode of clips\nThe animation of the battles though,is another story,they're fluid and sometimes beautiful.\nI could've accepted time filling if it wasn't for the bad part of the series,see,the author was depressed before making the series,this is his way of getting out of it and it shows\nTts filled with half ass references to Freudian and Jung psychology(One of them is outdated and ridiculous,The other one symbolistic) and philosophy,which also fill time by getting this repeating scenes,\nSee,im all for anime or movies dealing with those two subjects if done well,the execution of the series and movie is piss poor\nThe movie continues the series where the show after two episodes of filler and bad philosophy left off,Shinji's been broken down,all the angels have been defeated but for some unexplicable stupid reason Seele wants to cause the third impact and so does Gendo,which makes all the series rendered moot and stupid,hurray!\nWe get someone jacking off,good action scenes,misato being cool,gendo being an asshole,this is all fine and dandy until we get a trippy scene which then breaks down into some avant garde scene with video of  an audience on a movie theater,images from japan, text and clips from the show,the movie then ends with the line that defines the whole franchise:how disgusting(whether its i feel sick or how disgusting is a problem for the subs)\nSee,most people who read this will probably assume that i came back with a bit of prejudice,i did somewhat,but i really wanted to like the series\nI just couldnt,at best it's mediocre,if ignore the bad philosophy and psychology\nAt worst,it feels like a high school essay on both subjects,in the end,\nI just didnt like it,i felt peace while rewatching the series though,my mind finally rested from the torture of the doubt if the series was any good,if you want a better series with self conclusion stories,that deals with heavy subjects,go watch ghost in the shell or lain\nThis is a cult anime show,only for the hardcore fans who get too much into it,if you're a newbie,i say take a pass and go do something better with your life\nEDIT 2015:\nIn hindsight,with now new knowledge that was given to me by some internet posts. I still stand by me decision to give it a 5. Mind you I should post some old Locomotion channel trailers that promise God vs Humans. This was misleading. Also,I kind of expected Evangelion to be more like the original Mobile suit Gundam 0079. Yet to fault it because it is not similar. It's stupid.  Without Gundam,there is no point to Eva. Eva is the watchmen of mecha anime as watchmen was to superhero comics. It is about deconstrucionism. I don't like deconstructions. To me they are very fucking boring\nIf and only IF  I compare it to modern anime,I would give this a 7. \nAt least EVA tries and has ambition.\n        "},

I looked it up on YouTube, and- not to sound cheesy- my life was changed forever. That did sound cheesy... nyoro~n...\nThe story, quite simply, is legendary. It's surprisingly deep, thought-provoking and, in bits of the later episodes and movies, oddly beautiful. I can quite honestly not say just how brilliant it is in words, or in anything else. It goes far beyond the basic idea of\n          \n        alien lifeforms invading the planet, causing the apocalypse and having to be defeated by a group of fourteen-year-olds who are being forced to pilot (what they think are) mechas. Far from being cheesy, pretentious or immature, as it could have been, it is, quite simply, perfect.\nNext, the art. This can be summed up in five words. \"This is a 1995 anime?!\" The art in Evangelion is amazing, in my opinion, beating some modern anime. The style is strangely realistic for an anime style, weird as that might sound- no giant eyes, and no crazy hair color without some reason for it. Even in the non-remastered version, the visuals are mostly crisp and clean, providing you don't watch it on low-quality blurry Youtube videos. \nNow, the sound. This is, again, incredible. The voice acting is perfect (providing that you ignore the dub), especially for Ayanami Rei, the introverted, slightly workaholic, mostly emotionless but still clearly human pilot of Eva Unit 00, and Nagisa Kaworu, who I can't explain about without spoiling a lot. The music is, if possible, even better. The mixture of original score, new versions of existing songs (examples; Ode to Joy in episode 24, Fly Me To The Moon as the ending theme to most episodes) and J-pop is just perfect. There's no balance problems or distortion, either.\nThe characters are among the best I've seen in any anime. They are surprisingly, almost painfully, realistic, and strangely relatable, odd as that might be. None of them come over as excessively emotional, ridiculously optimistic, out of place, or Mary-Sue-ish at all. I have a kind of attachment to all of them. You know you shouldn't like them so much; they're destructive, highly flawed, and, in the case of a few characters, sadistic, but you can't help but love them. I pretty much agree with other positive reviewers on the individual characters, so I'll skip over that. \nNow for the enjoyment factor. This is not the anime to watch if you only enjoy cutesy happy fluff. This anime is pretty much tragic. By the end, almost all the characters have gotten themselves destroyed, emotionally, physically or both. However, it manages to be just so enjoyable to watch. For some reason, you find yourself totally addicted to it. In some parts, it's oddly beautiful without you quite knowing why. \nOverall, this is one of the best anime out there. If you like drama, sci-fi, mecha, theotech, psychological stuff, or deep stories, you'll love Evangelion. Even if you hate all those things, watch it anyway. And if you hate the actual series, watch End of Evangelion before you consign it to the rubbish-heap. If you watched the series, you pretty much have to watch EoE; it answers almost all the unanswered questions and makes for a much more satisfying ending.\n        "},

Though the first 15 episodes are action focused and like I said earlier, have been done before, from episode 16 onwards the plot shifts its focus onto the psychological side of the characters, with some episodes taking place entirely inside the character's mind.\nArt-8: Although its dated now, at the time the animation of the series was truly spectacular and raised the bar for what was expected of anime art. But it still continues to look great, this is mostly due to the stunning lighting effects of the animation where the art's only real downside is in the character designs, which, apart from a few, are rather boring despite the fact that rei, asuka and misato have millions of people of all ages obsessing over them, myself included.\nSound-10: Not only is the soundtrack truly spectacular, with my personal favourite being \"hedgehog's dilemma\", but the sound effects are also triumphant especially in the amazingly detailed effects of the physical damages, every bone that cracks and snaps, every vain that gets sliced open, every organ that oozes out-all of it can be heard perfectly.\nCharacter-10: The depth of these characters is truly remarkable, and even though the series's main character is famously a giant pussy, the level of depth in how he is evaluated truly explains his lack of manliness fully. If I say any more I fear I might ruin the mystery of these characters so lets just skip ahead.\nOverall-10: Interesting, mysterious, powerful, emotional, intense, visceral, haunting and overall: Fucking amazing.\n"},

This anime entirely changed the rules regarding what an animated series could convey and how it could convey it. Virtually every anime released after 1995 draws at least some inspiration from NGE, meaning that the anime industry itself would not be what it is today without the not-so-simple simple  tale of a quiet boy named Shinji Ikari.\"\n-A synopsis of what everybody says about Neon Genesis Evangelion\nWow. With a reputation like that, I really had no idea how to feel when I\n          \n        started watching NGE.  I wanted to feel excited, but I didn't want to get my hopes up only to be disappointed; after all, there are many people who absolutely despise this anime and consider it to be vastly overrated. NGE is one of those shows that you either love or you hate, and I was unsure about what category I would fall into.\nWell, after watching the series, watching the \"End of Evangelion\" movie that concludes the storyline, deeply contemplating it, rewatching several parts of several episodes to try to make sense of the complex plot, analyzing the behavior of the characters, and further researching several things I didn't understand , I think I finally have grasped the series well enough to write a review on it.\nBasically, NGE is simply unlike any anime you have ever seen before, and you will never see another anime that parallels it. It is incredibly complex and very difficult to understand, but if you do understand it, you will view anime differently for the rest of your life and you might even learn something about yourself. It is certainly not without flaws, but NGE is a must watch for anime fans aged 17+ who are mature enough to handle its content.\nPlot: 8/10\nWhen watching the first few episodes of NGE, it's hard to understand what all the commotion is about. It comes across as a relatively generic installment to the already stereotype-heavy mecha genre. It isn't until the show starts hinting that there is some kind of conspiracy going on that things start to get weird. Then it gets weirder, and weirder, and weirder, until finally, all hell breaks loose. Actually, that is an understatement; things get absolutely INSANE by the end of NGE, and no matter how many times you hit the pause button to collect your thoughts and try to figure out what the hell is happening, you still probably won't get it. Understanding the plot of the show requires you to think very hard, rewatch episodes, and research certain aspects of it on the internet. This, of course, is the reason this is a love-it or hate-it anime: people who hate it despise the \"wild goose chase\" that the plot sends you on. I don't deny that NGE goes around its elbow to get to its thumb, but when you finally realize what is going on, you start to develop an appreciation for it's intricacy.\nNGE does not tell its story in the traditional fashion because it is not a traditional anime; in fact, NGE draws more similarities to literature then it does to anime. This is because NGE is an allegory; just about everything in it stands for something much, much more significant then it's face value. The show explains very little and most of what we know about the plot comes from subtle hints and personal interpretations rather then proper explanations. If all of this sounds like way too much to think about, NGE is likely not for you, because this anime is more then just a piece of entertainment; it is a journey into the human phycology. NGE made me contemplate things that I've never contemplated before, and I legitimately think I learned a few things about myself by watching it. I also loved the ending and thought it was a perfect way to end the series, but that is just my own personal interpretation as I know that many people did not like it.\nSo why only 8/10? Because NGE simply does not provide explanations or meanings to EVERYTHING it throws at you. There are still several things about the plot that could have been handled better and there are still minor plot points that are so ambiguous that even trying to loosely interpret them is a shot in the dark. Ultimately, certain aspects of the show simply feel unfinished due to the well documented financial problems that NGE experienced towards the end. Despite this, NGE's story is a powerful and very enjoyable experience.\nArt: 7/10\nWhile the animation was outstanding for its time, it is beginning to show its age. However, that doesn't bother me much because some of  the scenes that are being animated are so awe-inspiring and thought provoking that it doesn't have to be recent to be good. The animation style becomes more and more shocking as the show goes on\nSound: 8/10\nAn interesting and largely indescribable choice of music, in my opinion. I thought it fit well with the tone of the show though, and lets not forget that NGE's OP is arguably the most influential OP of all time; it set the new standard of what a show's opening theme should be and what it should accomplish, and that deserves tremendous amounts of credit.\nCharacters: 10/10\nIn an industry that is (and was) overpopulated by characters with no flaws who are based on the aspirations of the audience (such as being a lady's man or a total badass) like Kirito from Sword Art Online or Shirou from Fate/Stay Night, NGE opts instead to write it's characters based on the realizations of the audience.\nAll of the characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion are symbols for the insecurities that all of us have deep within us and for the methods we use to cope with those insecurities. Specifically, NGE's characters all have a deep rooted hatred for themselves; they all feel that they are unworthy of any sort of love or acceptance, but all of them cope with this insecurity in a different way. This is especially the case with the protagonist, Shinji, whose flaws we are able to recognize in ourselves so easily, allowing the meaning of the show to really get across. By basing the characters of the show on actual human emotions/flaws and executing the portrayal of those emotions/flaws to perfection, NGE has arguably the most realistic and relatable cast of characters in anime history.  \nThe symbolism of the characters (which I won't discuss in great detail) flies over the head of a lot of people because Shinji is the only character that has his insecurities specifically stated. It is not clear until much later in the series that the other characters have very similar problems that Shinji does. For example, Asuka appears on the outside as the complete opposite of Shinji; she is extremely confident, outspoken, and self-assured to contrast with Shinji's shyness, quietness, and self-hatred. As the show goes on, however, it becomes increasingly apparent that Asuka isn't exactly as comfortable with herself as she acts (that is quite the understatement). I don't want to spoil anything, but watching all the characters slowly  spiral downward until they hit their breaking point is very fascinating, incredibly thought provoking, and most notably: applicable to real life. \nThe characters in NGE aren't great for the reasons that characters in other anime are great; they are great because the viewer can relate to all of them in a way that makes him/her question their own life; there is a piece of Shinji in all of us, a piece of Rei in all of us, and a piece of Asuka in all of us. Their quest to obtain inner piece is portrayed so passionately and convincingly that it holds the audience's attention through thick and thin. \nCoping with loneliness and self-hatred is something that we all have to go through, and NGE's characters provide the perfect vessels to raise the questions that NGE was intending to raise, and I give the show a tremendous amount of respect for that. Masterfully written characters.\nOverall: 8.5/10\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is NOT your average anime; it cannot be watched in the same way that you would watch other shows. If you not prepared to think extremely hard and put forth a significant amount of time into watching , rewatching, and analyzing the show, then I recommend you steer clear. This anime is an allegorical, symbolic journey more then it is a television show, and people who don't understand that are going to hate it. NGE stands as the pinnacle of psychological anime after completely destroying the previously perceived limitations of the industry. However, perhaps NGE's greatest accomplishment is that it made us think about our own lives and problems in ways we never had before, and that is outstandingly hard to do even for something that isn't so seemingly simple as anime."},

If you want to call yourself an anime fan, you should know it.  The greatest thing about this series is that everybody has their own unique interpretation of it.  The reason why I gave the animation a 9 is that, during the time the show was being made - especially near the end - Gainax wasn't really confident in the show's potential for success (at the time it was being aired on TV Tokyo, which had 5 affiliates, and only became successful after word of mouth had\n          \n        spread rumor of the show all over the place and a larger broadcast network decided to pick it up... or something like that) and so they cut both the budget and scheduling for the Eva project, so later in the series, the animators didn't have time to make as many frames as they would have liked, and eventually they ran out of time to complete all the frames they needed, so in the last 2 next episode previews and even the last episode, they had to use macro shots of storyboards and the like.  You'll be so wrapped up in the show at this point that you'll probably think it was intentional.  Original and intriguing characterization is one of the strongest points of the show.  The story is compelling.  There is some interesting use of music in some parts of the show.  Most likely, Eva will either send you on a trip or throw you for a loop.  It'll put your brain in a blender and kinda rearrange it a little bit.  If you just finished watching something like FLCL, I suggest putting this one off for a while.  Go watch Gundam or something.  Come back after that.\n        "},

Hideaki Anno, the creator of the Eva series, might not have known this at the time when this show first aired, but he had created one of the most memorable animes in existence, which is also arguable depending on who you ask.\nAs far as story goes, it peeked my interest while watching the first episode. However, when watching the series, I was wondering if I had skipped a season,\n          \n        just due to the fact that all the characters seemed to know eachother already. Later I found that out to be the work of a top secret organization. I had never watched Gundam as a kid, nor did I like Transformers at the time. I was never into mecha shows or movies. I think when I first started watching this, the only thing mecha-related I had in my life was the few hours spent on MechQuest Online, and that was quit a while back. But, Neon Genesis Evangelion was the anime that changed the genre for me, mainly due to it's story, but also due to the action and suspense in it. I can't really say whether it's considered \"unique\" or not, due to the fact that I haven't seen many animes that air before the 90's, but I found it to be interesting and enjoyable every episode.\nJudging from any of the other 90's animes I've seen, the Eva series had some of the best artwork for it's time. It's nothing like today's anime art, but considering this show is almost 20 years old, you gotta give them credit for making it look so extraordinary. I liked the battle scenes, the character art, even the scenery was something to gawk at. It's not often you get to see a freaking city sink into the ground and have it replaced by a battlefield designed for Evas and Aliens.\nSound is always something that I have trouble with when it comes to English Dub, and I preferred to watch this in English instead of having to read subtitles due to the important fact that I may miss something that is vital to the show and then have no idea what happened later. But there weren't too many issues with the dubbed cast, which is surprising, because I've seen a lot of bad voice acting in my days (Doki Doki School Hours? Anyone?), but the cast pretty much nailed it. I can't say that I thought the actors chosen to play some of the characters were perfect, there's always at least 1 character's voice I hate, but overall I didn't really have a problem.\nI liked most of the characters. Occasionally there were a few moments where I'd just love to punch someone because of their idiocity, not really gonna give any names *Cough* Shinji *Cough* though. There seemed to be a lot of characters, and most of them had a past that you'd eventually need to learn about, and there are quite a few moments explaining more about the characters' lives and such, so getting to know them wasn't a problem. Liking most of the characters though isn't always easy... there were a few I had problems with, and again, not gonna give any names *Cough* Shinji *Cough*. I did however like Asuka, just because she brings that comedy feel to the show, and she's not as annoying once you start to like her.\nI can say I enjoyed this show for the most part. Last 2 episodes seemed to go on forever, leaving an ending that'll make anyone scratch their head and wonder, \"Wait, congratulations for what?\". But that's why the series gets better and there are alternate endings! (Referring to Death & Rebirth then The End of Evangelion) Overall, it had tons of action, some good comical moments, plotline was good, not every character was hateable *Cough* Shinji *Cough*... for most of you fans of the mecha genre, this is definitely a series to get into.\n        "},

They always talk about how confusing it is and there was no real conclusion to it. When I first watched it, it didn&rsquo;t really seem confusing &ndash; until the ending. Since I want to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible, I&rsquo;ll just tell you to watch it yourself to witness the confusion on your own *wink*\nI rarely watch mecha anime, and it&rsquo;s even rarer for me to find mecha anime that I like. Guess what? I like NGE. It&rsquo;s interesting, it&rsquo;s weird, it&rsquo;s\n          \n        unique, it&rsquo;s mind boggling, maybe too mind boggling but I don&rsquo;t really mind because I like series that require my attention. Another thing I like about it is that it&rsquo;s not too serious &ndash; it has its funny parts too so I rarely got bored with it.\nOne important aspect of NGE is the characters. Each character is unique and has his or own story, but all of them are yearning for acceptance, I think. My favorite has to be Shinji. I know there are people who don&rsquo;t like him but he really is my favorite. It&rsquo;s because I love how he reacts to his circumstances &ndash; it&rsquo;s exactly how I would expect a 14 year old boy to react if he were thrown into a similar situation. In fact, Shinji, Rei and Asuka were all very childlike and acted like their age, which is something you find rare in anime. I also like Rei and Misato, by the way.\nA lot of well known VAs for this anime, but my favorite has to be Megumi Ogata. When I first heard Shinji&rsquo;s voice, I immediately thought it was perfect for a boy like Shinji. I love it when female VAs play male roles, but most of the time you can tell that right away. In this case, I didn&rsquo;t even notice it was a female VA at first, because he really did sound like a pre-teen boy. Megumi hayashibara was also perfect for Rei Ayanami (and Pen Pen I guess), but then again, everyone was perfectly suited to play their respective roles. I guess this is one of the series I&rsquo;ve seen that has impeccable voice casting.\nI would say storytelling and visuals were great if it weren&rsquo;t for the last 2 episodes that made me dizzy. It was a splice of different images that seemingly had little connection. Character design was great. I appreciate the wonderful design of the female characters&rsquo; figures &ndash; unrealistic, but nicely drawn. The colors need some work though, since I thought they were kind of bland and clashed with each other. I don&rsquo;t understand why Eva unit 01 had to be purple and neon green, but the Evas looked great, especially Asuka&rsquo;s.\nI absolutely love the opening theme. I liked it ever since I first saw a Tagalog dub version of NGE on local TV. All I did was watch the opening credits and when it was done, I wouldn&rsquo;t stick around for the actual episode. Of course, I watched the whole thing this time around but I still like that song. As for the ending song, &ldquo;Fly Me to the Moon&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s different versions were okay, but I don&rsquo;t really see why they decided to use it as an ending theme. It&rsquo;s one of my mother&rsquo;s favorite songs, and it&rsquo;s kind of weird for me to hear it each time I watch an episode of NGE.\nIt definitely was worth it to watch this anime. I guess I can say that Neon Genesis Evangelion changed my opinion on mecha anime. I&rsquo;d probably watch more mecha after this.\n        "},

Neon Genesis Evangelion is extremely popular, both positively and negative, receiving both high praise and high criticism. Nevertheless, it is a cIassic, and anyone into the genre of anime should give it a look whether or not they'd actually like it.\nEvangelion centers around a world torn from the attacks of the \"Angels\", a species of lifeform that evolves alongside humans but is trying to cause an apocalypse. Without giving too much away, the story goes far deeper than that and can shock you with\n          \n        just how complicated the situation really is. This isn't your ordinary \"bad guys are attacking, defend the world\" scenario. You're in for it if you think that's the case. The defenders against these creatures? Teenagers pilotingthings called EVAs... \"mechs\"with the souls of a loved one of the pilot inside. Why teenagers? An event occured before the timeline of the anime called \"Second Impact\", which leveled most of Earth, and only people born after this event can pilot them to prevent \"Third Impact\".\nAs I said, the anime goes very deep and gets very complicated, but it's never actually too difficult to understand. It's just there is much more to Evangelion than what you think when you watch the first few episodes of it. The characters are somewhat standard characters, but they don't act in a boring manner, or act in a way that just doesn't make sense. Their emotions, actions, and everything about them fits with whatever is happening at the time. This helps bring the fictional world to life, however there's a few drawbacks to the behavior of the characters.\nFor one, by the climax of the show, most characters are all acting in a similar manner, depressed over the tragedies happening around them, but all for different reasons. Even with all the different reasons the characters at this point lose much of their personalities, especially normally cheery Misato or confident yet somewhat annoying Asuka. Rei and Shinji are the only characters who continue to act in a somewhat normal manner than they have been throughout the anime by the time everyone is struggling with their inner turmoils.\nThe drama and action in the show is exciting and it never lets up. While it starts off like quite a normal anime, by the time Rei is introduced all bets are off and you're in for an anime that will pull you in episode after episode. Whether it's the battles with the various Angels which continue to evolve and become a tougher challenge for Rei, Shinji, and Asuka (the pilots of the EVAs), or Shinji's struggle to feel important even without having a caring father or a living mother to help him do so, Evangelion is intriguing and deep, and I found myself hooked and wanting to watch each episode one after another (which I did, for the most part).\nSadly, the show ends in a disappointing manner. After the defeat of the last Angel, which was disguised as another EVA pilot for the episode (but was actually easily indentifiable as the final Angel if you pay just enough attention), the perspective changes from outside the world to inside the minds of the main characters: Misato, Asuka, Rei, and Shinji. They all try to come to terms with the problems they're all facing, and as interesting as it was to watch these monologues, it left me questioning what was happening outside their minds, as there was still business to be taken care of. Episodes 25 and 26 leave you with a somewhat content feeling, but you'll still be disappointed that the plot wasn't wrapped up the way you would like it to be, as (spoiler alert) a group of people that's been pulling the strings all along is still trying to enact Third Impact even without the Angels, and in reality, the Angels were all just pawns. The last two episodes were made on a low budget, and this is almost waved in your face throughout the episodes, and while the episodes themselves don't deviate too far from the story, they are a tongue stuck out at you if you were hoping for something better.\nEven though the main seriescan take a few episodesto get you pulled in, and ends with 2 somewhat disappointing episodes, NGE as a whole is still a great anime, worthy of being watched by anyone that likes anime, even if you will like NGE itself or not.\n"},

If you ever wondered what’s the big deal over anime, Evangelion sums it up pretty well. It’s an all-around great work of animation. It uses the strengths of the medium while not abandoning the old qualities that make for great storytelling. It also loses itself in the last two episodes.\nIt’s not the awful ending that Death Note has. It doesn’t make all the time spent seem fruitless. It’s an icarus kind of thing. The last two episodes are where the series gets truly experimental. It abandons traditional storytelling and tries using inner monologues.\n          \n        It’s a bold idea, especially in an anime that’s until then just upgrades the Mecha genre.\nIt doesn’t work, though. The monologues are not just about the characters but discuss the various themes that pop up in the anime. As the anime progresses, it makes it clearer and clearer that there’s more than well-constructed fights to this. Instead of using some creative method to wrap the themes, and maybe take advantage of all the symbolism they left lying around.\nSadly, they chose monologues. That’s just a way of beating the viewer over the head with your themes. We don’t need them. The 24 episodes that came after that make an excellent job of developing characters. The backstory of the Angels is barely revealed, and that’s great. The creators know that why things happen is less important than the reactions to the characters. We don’t always know why things happen but we always react. That’s the series’ greatest strength. Beneath the giant robots and the fighting, it’s an excellent chronicle of relationships and how they develop and change.\nNot to say that it’s a pretentious thing that believes that great dialogue make up for anything else. Another reason why Evangelion is so brilliant and why it deserves its classic status is because it takes advantage of the format. There’s just as much effort put into the design. Developed characters aren’t an excuse to make bland looking characters. Rei, Misato, Suzuhara, Gendo, the Fifth Child each has a unique design that doesn’t try to be real but look cool. There is no excuse for bland character design. If looks aren’t important in your story, it should be a novel.\nThe Angels are where the design choices shine the most. They are unique at every aspect. Every single one has a distinctive look, and each one functions differently. The variety is so big that the idea that they’re of the same ‘race’ comes off as pretty far-fetched. Either way, they make for both cool-looking enemies and interesting ones. The unique attributes also means the fights aren’t just extended sequences of stuff exploding. There’s a problem-solving elements to it. Each battle is a puzzle the characters have to solve. It may be not as meaningful as the relationships between the characters, but it’s great that the series is also willing to have fun.\nEvangelion is an anime that wants it all. The characters are both developed and good-looking. The battles are pure fun, but the drama is strong. Evangelion wants both the fun energy of Mecha and the qualities that make for any classic story. The last two episodes make for a very underwhelming finish, but they don’t undo the other 24 episodes. Evangelion is worth watching regardless of your opinions on anime. It’s a great piece of storytelling at all fronts.\nXTC’s logo also makes a cameo appearance.\n        "},

Story, then Characters, Art blah blah blah... This is also my first review here, and im going to look at it from a critical point of view, so bear with me if you think its not very good or something has offended you. Was not intended.\nThis is purely my take on the series. So, while reading this, bear in mind I'm reviewing it from the Jap audio with subs version, as the\n          \n        Dub, IMO, is inferior. WARNING! There may also be some major spoilers here. You have bee warned. So, here goes:\nNeo Genesis Evangelon is not an easy anime to watch, whether your a philosophical type or not. Its ideas and messages, brought out mainly in the characterisation, are very complex and it is wise to do a little bit of background research if you feel you're not completely upto the challenge of watching it from the off. It requires the watcher to also consider what their own interpretation of its views are. It's by no means easy watching. But, in no way does that take away its sense of enjoyment, usually at its most enjoyable when oozed through the personality of certain characters, namely Asuka and for the most part, Misato. \nThe most important aspect of the anime though, is the characters and their psychological development as the series progresses. It's clear right from the beginning that Shinji's mental state is not completely stable, highlighted in the very first scene no less when he sees Rei in the distance, only for her to disappear. He's mental well-being discintegrates as he continues to pilot on Eva, which you could say is what causes his descent into madness (I'll get onto the Eva's later). It's all centred around his belief that no-one cares for his well being, and that his feels he is unappreciated for what he does. His hatred for his father is also a huge contribution to his mental condition and development, highighted by the near death of Touji when his father handed control of his Eva to a dummy program agaisnt Shinji's will. And despite some criticism about them, the final two episodes, which is a sort of sub-conscious analysis of his own self worth, highlights these point perfectly for anyone who concentrates on these issues well enough.\nRei is, despite being a centrally themed character (Im expecting a possible flaming for this), quite a hollow character, although im sure this was deliberate by Hideaki Anno. As it happens, it works in the favor of the character in terms of the other character deveopments and unravelling the her origin towards the end. Her soulless image, and emotionless tone add emphasis her role. The show can almost convince you she is a 'puppet' of sorts for Gendo (Shinji's father), and is the child that he had always aspired Shinji to be like, but never materialised. She could be considered the catalyst for the downfall of both Shinji and Asuka's mental states. While her expression may make you consider whether she is acually human, this logic is tested to the extreme towards the end of the series (I won't spoil that much).\nAsuka, while breaks up alot of the seriousness to be begin with, and injects some humour and enjoyment with her personality, I believe is acually one of the weaker characters in the show. While she too has had a troubled past, It is quite reminiscent of Shinji's past experience, only Shinji never saw his mother, where as Asuka's memory of her mother is of hanging herself. Throughout the show, she feels she is alone, and that she has no-one to look to in times of desperation (a bit like the mentallity of what we believe bully's are thinking). This could be the reason for her fiery, quite bossy attitude. While it is a bit refreshing to have her character there, I feel she is quite shallow and could have been developed a bit further. Coming in about 1/3 of the way through though, this is not too bad.\nIMO though, the best character in the show by some distance is Misato. Not only is she a character that oozes style and enjoyment factor into the show, but she is also a very conplex individual, steming from her memories of the 2nd Impact (from what I gather, a sort of world implosion that almost destroys everything in sight, abit like what happens in the End of Evangelion) and her bid to survive. She is also a lonely character, but unlike the other characters, she finds a way to combat this (or repress it) by her determination for the other characters to survive. It's rare to see that she puts any of the pilots in danger because she knows that not only will she likely be accused of causing it, but will also be a direct downfall on her own pyschological state. I feel that not only is she the character that keep together and stabilises the life of the main characters (and some minor characters), but also holds together the series itself. I feel she is not just a stereotypical 'bad-ass' woman who enjoys her drink', but a guiding spirit that brings the characters to as best a mental well-being as she is capable. For that, I absolutely love her character. \nIt is also worth a small mention to some of the minor characters too which are pivital to the overall expression of the series. Kaji is quite a deep character despite what the dialogue may lead you to believe, offering guidance to Shinji that had major effects on the overall narrative, and is the catalyst for Misato's character development as they begin to re-unite, with the scene of them walking down the street at night, Misato bursting into tears being a particular one which springs to mind. His teasing of Asuka is also quite humourous, while effective on her well-being at the same time. Another mention should go the Gendo, whose screen presence is immense at times, his lust for power ultimately leading to the downfall of not only NERV, but Shinji aswell. His meetings with Rei are also an intriguing talking point (again, I won't spoil that for you).\nFinnally, possibly the most complex 'characters' in the series, is the Angels and the Eva's themselves. Unlike the other characters, the both are completely open to your own interpretation. This is where the background research may come handy. Their representations are extremely dependant one your opinion, and I don't think there is a definitive answer. Personally, I think that the Eva's are humans attempt at trying to controll themselves, but it also depends entirely on the/a certain human in question. Shinji is the prime being in this instance, as he loses hes psychological well-being, the subconscious begins to take over, and eventually that is what happens to Eva Unit 01, it's is Shinji's sub-conscious taking over and is out of control due to his fragility. In Asuka's case, as she begins to lose hers sense of apreciation, rather than the Eva go beserk, its stops altogether. *MAJOR SPOILER ALERT* Rei's Eva is governed by the idea that she is lacking a soul. Her sub-conscious lacks clear direction and self functionallity, therefore, its rare that she exceeds in the Eva, with it either going on a rampage, or constantly being the target for Angels. *MAJOR SPOILER ALERT OVER* The Angels are, from my own interpretation, a representation of humans attempt at human control. Again, this is where research is useful. The names of the Angels are not just random made names. They ALL have some religious background, and despite what some people say, Religion is human's attempt as social control. The Angels, therefore IMO, are mankinds 'self-destruct' button, so to speak. \nAs I said, ALL is open to your own interpretation, this is just me views on what the characters represent. As you can probably tell, I am a huge lover of this series. It requires you to think about what it is saying, only limited by your own intelligence and your imagination. \nI am not going to mention anything about the narrative (why the story is structured the way it is) and story itself, as again, it is all open to your own opinion. Finally, I will mention that for the time, the animation is stunning for the time. It is a good visual fest for those that were looking for good art, not just a thought provoking story. \nI will end on this. If you're looking for a straightforward mecha anime high on action, then this is probably not for you. If, however, you want to have your intellect challenged or worked, then I highly recommend watching NGE. You won't regret it.\n        "},

How Gainax nearly went bankrupt in developing this series.  How TV-Tokyo chopped the studio's budget.  How impacting the final two episodes were, and how they still create a maelstrom of controversy to this day.  How Hideaki Anno nearly lost his nerve (pardon the pun) just making NGE.  You name it, and the lunatics at Gainax practically did it while working on NGE.\nIt's easy to attack NGE today - yes, you can strike at the characters and the somewhat loopholed story.  But the truth\n          \n        is that everything done in NGE was intentional; you're not supposed to relate to the characters as easily as you would in a typical anime, nor are you supposed to interpret the story with a wink and a smile coming from every frame.  Neon Genesis Evangelion is to be taken with a grain of salt, and it would be a good idea to throw away all preconceived notions of anime and take it for what it is, which remains to this day one of the finest pieces of animation in recent history.\nThe best part of NGE is how well it holds up to this day, even though we are now past the year 2000 AD and quickly approaching 2015 AD.  Like a good movie, you can take NGE and watch it at any point in your life and find new things about it.  The longer you stand away from NGE, the more you begin to truly appreciate the artwork, the soundtrack, and even the voice work.  It is still a ton of fun to analyze it like a therapist getting into a patient's head and to try to make sense of NERV, SEELE, Second Impact, Human Instrumentality, etc. (if you don't know what those are by now, you need to educate yourself quickly.) ADV practically owes everything to NGE, and thankfully they have been so generous in treating us fans with a multitude of DVD releases and other products for us to keep appreciating NGE.\nThere's never such a thing as watching anything right or wrong, but there is such a thing as seeing something in a new perspective.  NGE is one of those rare gems that always asks its audience to view it with different eyes each time, to try and understand its message better if you didn't get it the last time.  When I first saw NGE, I hated just about all the characters in it, especially Shinji.  Later, as I grew a little bit older, I have related myself to him, and now, older still, I feel as if I know him personally.  I am nothing like Shinji, but there are times when I feel as if I could be.  That is how well I feel like I know NGE.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=68,   ["text"]="                          \n    (BACKLOG)\nCouldn’t put this off forever huh? Love it, hate it, heard of it or not, Neon Genesis Evangelion remains of of the most controversial anime of the 90’s, a show that deconstructs the mech genre, delves deep into the psyche of its characters, has more pretentious symbolism than I care to list, and all this leads to one of the most infamous last two episodes in the history of anime.  Some declare it a masterpiece, many say it’s complete sh*t, but I’m going to do my best on telling you guys what I made of of the strange show unraveling before me. \nAnd for\n          \n        heaven’s sake……\nFast forward 15 years after the cataclysmic event known as the Second Impact wiped out half of the world’s population. Huge mysterious alien beings known as Angels have appeared in Tokyo, and since Earth’s military forces are no match for these alien war machines, the Japanese government do what they typically do in such a situation: establish a secret military force known as NERV who  build giant mechs named Evangelions to combat the threat. But by some arbitrary rule of anime, the pilots of the Eva’s  have to be 14 year old children, one of those children being Shinji Ikari, the last person on the planet who you would chose to save the world from horrifying alien monsters. The show then follows an Angel of the Week type setup; as Shinji whines, Tokyo gets destroyed a few times, and we witness a downward spiral of all of the characters sanity meter’s. But as the show wears on and typical mech stereotypes begin to peel away, it becomes clear that something huge is going on behind the scenes, and a truth  about the Angels, NERV, and the entire nature of the Evangelions is waiting to be revealed that could ultimately mean the end of the world. \nNow, all of this makes the set-up to Evangelion so goddamn interesting. I was completely immersed in the story, the characters, the mystery behind the Angels, and I found myself ready to commit; all Evangelion had to now was blow me out of my seat…..and then it begins to go wrong. You see this series is infamous of its ending, and for good reason, because for all these interesting questions Evangelion raises it never seems to answer to a satisfying degree. OK, let me get something straight,  standard definitions aside, there is a big difference for me between a complicated plot, and a convoluted one. Something can have a complicated plot, in fact, I love complicated plots, but there’s something wrong with your plot being needlessly complicated. Evangelion adds on so many subplots that it’s hard to keep count, everyone of them needing a lot of explanation to make sense. Evangelion has enough religious symbolism to write an entire book of symbolic pretentiousness, these things being added to an already grand and confusing plot, so by the time the last 5 or so episodes are rolling, you, the viewer, will have about 1,000 questions, and hardly any answers.\n	This is ultimately Evangelions downfall. It gives half truths, ones that you really need to examine in order to piece together some kind of meaning from the story they come from. It gives you a couple stems to work ideas, and then says “right, you work out the rest.” And I’m sorry, but this is not OK. Sure you can have different experiences every time, have a different outlook on the series, even realize a piece of the plot makes sense when it didn’t before but even me, who had a great deal of knowledge of the series’ plot and twists and symbolic meaning before I ever watched the show, could hardly work out what the hell had happened by the end of the series. Sure, after thinking for awhile, and with some of the movie’s help(see End of Evangelion) I think I know mostly what happened…..I think. \nIn the end, for the amazing plot it had going for it, Evangelion never tells you what happened, why everything happened, how. After watching the show, the follow up movie, the Rebuild Movies, reading multiple interpretation and reviews, and thinking on my own for quite awhile, I still don’t know what exactly happened. \nAnd again, that’s just not OK. \nChrist, have I still not got to the characters? Right then, let’s start with our protagonist Shinji Ikari. Having lost his mother at a very young age and being heavily neglected by his father Gendo Ikari, this leaves Shinji with a confidence and mental state so low that he can hardly even function on his own. So to everybodies great surprise I”m sure, when Shinji is chosen as the pilot for Evangelion Unit 1 and tasked with saving the world, he just elects to run away. It kind of becomes a running theme(sorry) with the series; Shinji deciding to try to run away from his problems, and it’s not like I can’t see where he’s coming from. He already had a crappy life, and now he’s being told to pilot a giant mech he’s never seen or heard of before in order to fight ungodly terrifying creatures, but the problem here is that Shinji never really changes. Almost through the entire series, Shinji continues to whine and say how nobody cares about him. If he had ever grew confidence with his victories over the Angels and actually grew a backbone, he would have a been a good character, but this really never happens, all the way up to the end of the show. OK, there is a part like halfway through the show where he starts to develop relationships with his teammates and grow confidence, but due to a truly traumatic event that I won't talk about it detail, that get stunted pretty quickly. \nAsuka Langley Soryu is the redheaded German pilot of Evangelion Unit 2, and pretty much the exact opposite of our unconfident awkward protagonist. Appearing later on in the show, Asuka is a skilled pilot of the Eva Unit 2, and has a head that’s too big for her own good. She has a very outgoing personality, is much more socially adept than Shinji is, and this, combined with her condescending tone of voice, can make her even annoying at times, even if she does become kind of a badass during the Angel fights. As the show continues through, her anxieties come to light as her backstory is revealed, which I’m not going to spoil because course it’s completely horrific, but just trust me, she’s as emotionally broken as basically everyone else on the show, and I think you’ll like her by the end. \nHonestly, even though the cast of this show is actually quite large, I’m going to restrain talking about  them. I’ll just say the interactions and relationships between these characters are some of the most interesting I’ve ever seen, so I’ll let you experience them for yourself when you go watch the show for yourself. And yes, you should go see the show despite all i’ve been saying, if just to experience this interesting and mentally broken cast. Problem is though, despite how well written they all are, none of them are particularly likable, being all equally terrible people in their own right, but I think if you can look past that, you’ll begin to appreciate their complexity and motivations. \nIt’s pretty much general knowledge that the budget for Evangelion was extremely small, and leads to a very tightly handled show. Nothing really moves much when an Angel battle isn’t occurring; the characters faces are covered in shadow, a still frame is shown playing ambient noise etc and it becomes really frustrating after a while. Though you can see why. because when an Angel battle is occurring, everything is moving in unison, and the battles become freakin’ awesome. Unfortunately, as the show progresses, the animators decide to skimp even more, and this leaves the Angels battles severely underwhelming. One is defeated in a goddamn montage, one battle lasts literally a minute,  and one is just a giant shadow so not much animation to worry about there. Even the music just sees either unfitting or underwhelming, leaving these battles lacking impact or tension when they’re occurring; not making these battles against awesome alien monsters as cool or epic as they really should be. Granted, there is a pretty cool fight near the end, so that’s something, though the last two episodes rid that satisfaction pretty quickly…\n	The rest of the soundtrack is really very forgettable, and not just this, but many songs are repeated, especially this one slice of life jingle that got stuck my head for a ridiculously long time. I’m not really left with much to talk about from a technical standpoint, which is such a shame, because if Evangelion had had the budget to do what it wanted, it would have made up(to some degree) for its other faults. But unfortunately, we got what we got. \nA show like Evangelion is really one that you draws your own opinion from, and mine is one of thousands out there. But what really is my opinion on the show? Well these problems and all this aside, I think I liked Evangelion. The tragedy of it though, if it handled its plot well, even with all the technical issues, it really could have been masterpiece.  All I can say is to just keep these points I’ve made in mind, when you go see the show. And if you can appreciate it for what it is, I can go tell you to watch it all. This series, End of Evangelion, the Rebuild movies, so when Evangelion 4.0 brings this legendary franchise to an end, it will make complete and perfect sense. \nAnd maybe I’ll sprout angel wings and fly,\nFinal Verdict: 7/10\nP.S: A point to you if you realized all the unnecessary religious terms I used. Kind of a analogy for the show really. \n"},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=67,   ["text"]="                          \n    This is a review of the show, and does not take the movies into account.\nEvangelion is an anime I believe no two people will have the exact same opinion of. It has a different effect on each viewer, either good or bad. Personally I believe that fans tend to give this anime too much credit. Though I do not think Evangelion is a bad show it is certainly a show that has made mistakes and could have been better, as is true with any show ever made. \nFirstly the story. Something most people can agree on is that the story for this show is unusual\n          \n        and something new, unorthodox; especially in the field of anime. This is certainly true, the show's heavy use of imagery, symbolism, and dream-like sequences that seem to have no context was definitely new and unusual, but in my opinion, overused. The beginning of the show followed a predictable format: angel shows up, they fight the  angel, encounter a problem, solve problem, beat angel, end off with sexual humour. As the show progressed this gradually changed and there was more character development and use of the aforementioned dream sequences. The ending of the show, the last two episodes particularly, used these sequences to point where their relevance and impact waned. The first time I took time to try and understand  them, but eventually they felt overused and unnecessary. Some say that these episodes are the highlight of the show, but I say they are a poor and inconclusive ending, flawed and haphazard. The story would also seem confusing to many, who do not devote time to understand it. The show went from being predictable to overly convoluted, the story was enjoyable but could have been done better. \nThe characters in the show are complex and intricate, the highlight of the show.  Throughout the show Shinji is internally conflicted, and the way we see his character progress and change is one of the main focuses of the show. The epiphany at the end makes for a nice ending, but a nice ending for him specifically, the rest of the characters are left without an satisfying ending, their stories left untold. Shinji, in my opinion was not the most interesting character of the show, and focusing the last two episodes on him was a poor choice. The episodes were repetitive and somewhat boring, an injustice to the rest of the characters. Also the motivations of some of the other characters throughout the show are left unclear at times, forcing the viewer to make up his or her own reasons. This works in some cases but not in all, and causes some confusion. \nIs Evangelion a bad show? Certainly not. But it is not a show that would work for everyone. Some may find the show to be thought provoking and evocative,  while others convoluted and repetitive. I personally liked the show, but I do not think it deserves the recognition it gets from most fans. It is highly controversial and unique, but that alone should not be enough to put it on a pedestal, above shows that are actually better. Some say that certain aspects of the show should be excused because it is old; this is bullshit. There are anime that came out before that, such as Akira or Graves of the Fireflies, that still stand as some of the best anime of all time. Evangelion was one of the first anime to do what it did but should not be applauded for that reason alone, there are many shows that have come out afterwards and have achieved better results. I think it is an anime fan's responsibility to approach all shows unbiased and not to be influenced by the history of a show. \nEvangelion was a unique experience and one cannot get a good feel of it from simply reading a review. I believe this is a show that all anime fans should watch even though it is not a show all anime fans will enjoy. So I encourage you to watch the show if you have not and develop your own opinion.

It is a smart, confusing, deep and polarizing series, with possibly the greatest ending in all of anime (for good or bad).\nThe characters are all distinct personalities, and have huge gaping flaws that they hide behind talent, duty and sealed lips.  But many have the added of effect of being creepy (possibly because they hold onto so many secrets, personal or otherwise).  Shinji is probably the original antihero in anime, not in the way Hellsing is antihero, but in being like a sad mirror\n          \n        image of most coming of age boy anime heroes.\nShinji Ikari is a coward, weak and wishy-washy, kind of like a screwed up Charlie Brown.  He is someone who you have fun comparing to other characters in his role.  He doesn&rsquo;t seem to permanently develop and mature over time like Kamille in Zeta Gundam or Ayato in RahXephon.  He is not a smooth talking, professional James Bond-esque adult like Roger Smith in Big O.  And he&rsquo;s definitely nothing like the super macho super robot heroes like Domon Kashu of G Gundam (hell, he piloted a robot called God Gundam).  But you can see his effect on the genre after his appearance in Eva and you can see his origins in characters of the past.  And when he did get a backbone&hellip; wow!\nThe plot is&hellip; well its hard to explain, which says a lot about the show.  The first half reels you in to believe it&rsquo;s a traditional robot of the week anime, except with the twist of fighting the Angels (or Apostles) of God.  THE most memorable image for me in Eva and possibly in my time viewing anime is the first time I saw an Angel.  Without knowing what to expect, it shakes you to the core.\nAnd like the Angels, the plot is a shocker too, there are so many symbols and twists and red herrings that you start to fill in the blanks in your own way.  And that is the beauty of Eva&rsquo;s plot, it becomes a personal experience.  Because so much is left to the imagination that you start build a story in your head that is completely different from what someone else might pull from it.  Like the religion it uses so often to tell its story, Eva becomes open to interpretation.  Which leads to the infamous ending.\nObviously a lot can be given away by talking about the ending, but I am only going to skim over the reactions to it&hellip; or them (I told you the plot was confusing).  The last two episodes are shockers, more than likely downers and possibly a wall.  Many people were confused by it, me included.  But after a second viewing, the ending I originally thought was just confusing and sad became a happy ending.  Like I said, a lot is left up to interpretation.  And that is the beauty of Eva.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is in essence another boy becoming a man robot anime, but it is told in the most unique and engrossing way.  Empathy, apathy, action, tension and terror come together to paint a chilling picture of a world on the brink and the people trying to live normal lives with that fact.  With characters and a plot that have become legendary, iconic and almost mythic, it is no wonder that this show is my #1.\nNote: I wrote this review long before I found MAL, so I apologize if I don't address all of the subjects pointed out for review.  I hope the numeric scores will be enough.\n        "},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=62,   ["text"]="                          \n    Wow, I don't even know where to start with this review. I suppose I should begin by saying what an incredible sense of disappointment and disgust it filled me with. So much that I quite literally dropped the show halfway into the final episode.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion starts out okay, with a very whiny main character who doesn't seem to ever pay attention (IE, DODGE SHINJI DODGE and then he just stands there and get's shot for the 6th time) but these flaws are easily overlooked due to the interesting world in which this anime takes place.\nFor about the first half of the show the world\n          \n        environment is strong enough to maintain ones interest, and keep them coming for the next episode. In fact for the first half of the show the only issue I would complain about is the weak and overly emotional lead character. For example his father issues are so extreme that even when his dad is giving him advice that will save his life, he gets angry at his father for the suggestion, then has a hissy-fit after he is rescued.\nThe latter half of the show though. Holy fuck. They literally begin to have 1-3 minutes of a single frame just to fill the time, all while very loud classical music blasts. If the lazy animation wasn't the only issue they start to have entire episodes of what looks like hallucinogenic pipe-dreams, where the characters float around in various form (like stick figures) while the character talks to himself and attempts to philosophize. Multiple consecutive episodes are spent like this, and it happens to be the reason I was able to drop it finally at episode 26.\nThey would also have entire episodes in the last segments of the show where they would reveal all sorts of information that one could tell is supposed to be shocking. However when they revealed 20 different things in one episode, and never provided any clues or hinting earlier in the season it just felt very forced and weak.\nAll in all Neon Genesis Evangelion is a show that started off mediocre, managed to turn halfway decent, then dramatically killed itself. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=61,   ["text"]="                          \n    	When watching anime, controversies can never be avoided. Simply liking certain shows can be considered controversial. If a person says that X anime is the best anime ever, there will always be a group of individual that will surely bat an eyebrow. No one is safe. Everything a person say can lead to a controversy. I was watching a show at Discovery Channel about simple controversies when I think about doing this; reviewing the most controversial anime of all time: Neon Genesis Evangelion. Some consider it a masterpiece; some consider it crap, while other considers it the most blasphemous creation in history. So today, on\n          \n        its 20th year anniversary, a little review of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Not End of Eva (yet), not the Rebuilds (yet), just the series.\nStory:\n	Evangelion starts up really slooooooow. For about 20 episodes, they followed a formulaic monster of the week kind of thing. Sure it helps the characters develop throughout the series but they can definitely cut some of it out to save some money which they can use for the animation side of things (Not now. I’ll talk about it in the animation section). It isn’t that slow that you will feel bored the entire series because almost every episode, a new monster (or in this case Angels. IT’S AN ANGERU! IT’S A GUNDAM!) appears and wreck havoc while the pilots tries to kill it. Though the story is sidelined for the most part because of the action, there’s still this interesting thing brought up almost every episode: The Human Instrumentality Project (The Human Instrumentality Whatnow?). I watched Evangelion without having seen too much anime (I think I watched it after only watching 20 shows) so I didn’t actually get the HIP that much. Though I understand its purpose, I didn’t actually get why. And that is one of the things that EVA is excellent as: Not answering questions. Throughout the series (and the Rebuilds), questions tends to pile up without Hideaki Anno (The director of the series who if you didn’t know made an anime cameo in Shirobako as Mitsuaki Kanno. Yeah. You’re welcome) answering anything out of it. Viewers tend to have the same reaction every time they watch the series: “What the fuck is going on?”. Though most people don’t understand what’s going on, that is where the magic lies. You will want to watch it over and over again (I never did until now) just to understand it. Sometimes, having things not handed to you directly is a good thing; Death Billiards (Not Death Parade) is a very good example.\nCharacters:\n	Almost every character in the series, though they appear to be one-dimensional, has a hidden dark inner personality. Let’s give a little example; Misato Katsuragi appears to be a happy-go-lucky guardian to the pilots but she, herself, is a survival of the 2nd impact and hides behind a façade in an attempt to forget her past. Most character suffers from this similar trait and is one of the good reasons as to why I like this series. They appear to be one-dimensional in the beginning but throughout the series, you get to see their back stories on how they became the people that they are now. In my opinion, a good character building strategy not just for the main ones but for the supporting cast as well. Now, speaking of the main characters, let’s talk briefly about the 3 main pilots.\n	Starting out, we have Shinji Ikari, the story’s main protagonist. Many viewers who have seen the series considered Shinji as a (pussy) girl because of his lack of testosterone throughout the series. I, for one, beg to disagree. Shinji is a 14 year old kid who was thrown in to pilot the EVA not because he wanted to but because THEY (NERV. Dafuq does that stands for anyway? Nervous Erection Reaches Vagina?) wanted to. Even if he doesn’t want to, NERV wanted him to continue piloting the EVA. Though they succeeded in doing so, deep down, Shinji still doesn’t want to do it because of the pain and some other things. He clearly doesn’t care about the world because the world clearly doesn’t care about him so he lacks the resolve to save it in the first place. Being technically orphaned at a young age, he felt that the world was being unfair to a kid like him. So why not just let everyone suffer just like him? Well, that’s my conspiracy theory that Shinji is actually a God. Haha fuck me, right? Anyway, as far as I remember, never once has he willingly piloted the EVA because he wanted to (Then 3.0 happened) and he also never once said that he wants to stop the Angels in order to save the world (Which was evident in 2.0 where his actions clearly states that: “Fuck the world, all I want Rei”). Shinji is by far, the most human anime character that I have come across to. If you, or me were in his situation, we’d probably do the same things he did.\n	In character number 2, we have the pilot of EVA 2.0, the narcissistic bitch from Germany, Asuka Langley Soryuu: The grandmother of tsunderes worldwide. In all the anime I have seen, I have never met a tsundere that is older than her (Eva came out of 1995, right? If you know someone older than her at being a tsundere, please introduce her to me. I really want to meet her). In regards to his character, Asuka is praised by many (including me) because of her badassery. Considered to be the best pilot throughout the whole franchise (I think Mari’s greater but that’s just my personal taste. *cough* Bias because of Megane? *cough*) by the fans, she definitely shows this in every battle she has participated in. Her character is very fleshed out thanks to her back story which is probably one of the many reasons that she is many viewers’ favorite character in the series. She is a bitch but we get to see why. Which is in my honest opinion, makes a bitch a good tsundere.\n	Lastly, we have Zero. Not Lelouch, not that one from Megaman, but Rei Ayanami, which is like Asuka, the flagship and oldest (in my book) kuudere in anime. Thanks to her character, we get to see characters like Yuki Nagato, Kanade Tachibana, and Kaizuka Inaho (*grins* I know Inaho is much more of dan rather than than a kuu but fuck it. They are the same in my eyes) to name a few. In all of EVA, her character is probably the character that I hate the most (probably more than Gendo. It could be a tie). I don’t know, I think I just hate emotionless characters in general (Weird because I really like Yuki Nagato. She’s my PC, PS3 and CPs wallpaper. It must be my fetish coz she used to wear glasses. lol). Apart from being a key item in the Human Instrumentality Project, she never really did anything throughout the entire series. We see her injured at episode 1 in order to convince Shinji to pilot the EVA, but after that she almost did nothing throughout the entire series. She, like her character is supposed to be, is just like a doll in a doll-o’-rama. You’ll see her, but you wouldn’t care for her in general. A simple decoration. She can be considered a catalyst for Shinji’s character development but that’s about it. I don’t even know why Shinji has a thing for her. Mother complex perhaps? lol.\nAnimation:\n	The animation for Neon Genesis Evangelion was done by Gainax back in 1995. The animation in itself is really good if you consider that this came out in 1995. I think it looks better than Gundam Wing when it comes to animation but that’s just my personal taste. Yeah, when you look at the battle scenes in every episode, you might not have guessed that this came out in 1995. The details are amazing and the Angels and EVAs just look fantastic. If there’s one thing this section is bad at, that’s probably the obvious lack in budget. Throughout the series, we get to see obvious (and lame) budgeting strategies. A good example is (I forgot what episode it was) when Shinji was about to leave NERV for the first time and Misato tried to stop him in the station, there was about 5 minutes of frame silence. No movement was produced and the only thing that lets you know that you didn’t hit the pause button by mistake is the sounds in the train station. I want to talk about the animation in the last two episodes but I’m scared that this might turn into a rant about the ending rather than a review of the animation itself so I’ll just leave it at that. Now, if you look at the animation during action scenes, you can clearly say that they at least save the budget for that and that alone. This might be a bit controversial, but if they cut at least 5 episodes in the series, they might have pulled a good ending and the sequel films plus the rebuilds would have never seen the light of day. Well, from a business standpoint, that’s a bad thing, but if you’re doing it for the viewers, then it would have been an amazing ending a la End of Evangelion with a closed ending. If I can send a D-Mail to the past, I would have told Gainax to hire a good budget specialist.\nSound:\n	The soundtrack for Eva isn’t really bad, but I feel like because of the lack of budget, they recycled some famous music from some famous movies. There’s this one sound track that sounds like it was from a James Bond movie, I’m not kidding, it really is there. Having finished the show subbed for the first time, I really prefer the sub over the dub. The dub was a little weak in comparison to the Rebuild dubs (I know it’s almost the same voice actors/actresses but the dub for the series sounds a bit dated) but I think it’s still good if you consider it was dubbed yeaaaaarrrrssss ago (I don’t even know when).\nVerdict:\n	Neon Genesis Evangelion is a different kind of anime. It is one of the few anime that you can’t just watch once for you to understand everything it presents. A friend watched it trice and he still don’t get it. Watching it the 2nd time, some information that I didn’t absorbed the first time suddenly wants to enter my mind. I still don’t know what Hideaki Anno wants to say in this ever popular franchise but I know I enjoyed the hell out of it. A bit of advice if this review somehow convinced you to watch the series; don’t just go into EVA on a whim. Have the right mindset unless you won’t get shit. Expect good action, mindfuck, lack of explanation, End of Eva, and Rebuilds, then maybe, another set of Rebuilds (Restarts?).\n	Now, after pulling a couple of numbers out of my ass, sending it to Japan to fuck Shinji while Holden says “IT’S AN ANGERU!”, I present Neon Genesis Evangelion with an overall score of 8.16. Evangelion is a bit of a formulaic mecha anime but once it starts to pick up, you will be scratching your head due to confusion. It also has fleshed out characters that some might not like but no one can deny that they are well written characters that surely carried the show through its bad times. It’s one of the all-time classics and is a good anime to add on your credentials. If you have not seen it yet, go forth, you have my full pledged recommendation.\nAlternate Anime Recommendation:\n	For alternate anime recommendation, why don’t you try Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica? Both series starts out rather slow and formulaic but once they pick up, you will never realize when the sun came down. They are also classified as “deconstruction” of their respective genre with main characters with almost the same personality. Pussies.\n	There’s always Bokurano if you want to stick to mecha rather than shoujo. Both Evangelion and Bokurano revolves around battles with other mechas but there is a dark secret that both series posses; which I won’t talk about because of spoiler. \n	Well, that’s it for me! Bye!!!"},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=61,   ["text"]="                          \n    I do not consider myself fully qualified to review this series.\nI do not consider ANYONE to be fully qualified to objectively review this series. Why?\nBecause even though Neon Genesis Evangelion may or may not be the most popular anime of all time, it may or may not be the most important anime of all time, and it most certainly isn't the best anime of all time, one thing's for sure; it is the most controversial anime to have ever been created up to this day.\nNo other anime has created as much controversy and sparked more debate than this one. No other anime has split the\n          \n        opinions of critics and fans alike like NGE has. Even at the time this reviews was written, 17 years since the original airing of the show, anime fans across the world argue, fight and throw shit at each other ( figuratively speaking, of course ) over whether Evangelion is a masterfully done work of art or a mediocre, pretentious piece of piss. There's also a small minority of people standing in the middle, not subscribing to either of the two extremes in opinion about the series, who mostly end up getting covered in shit that the others throw; either from the haters who complain that the moderates give the show too much credit, or from the rabid fans who explode on the mere mentioning of a possibility that Evangelion might, just might not be “the best anime EVARRRRRR!“. I happen to belong to this moderate minority, but I do confess to be leaning more towards the “hating“ side than the other way. \nWhy do I think that I'm not qualified to review Neon Genesis Evangelion? Well, whenever I review or at least think about a series or a film or a book, I manage to almost completely separate and differentiate between what is objectively good or bad in it, and what is my subjective preference or taste. I can tell the difference whether something is genuinely bad or if it's just me not liking it, because every person has a different and particular taste. Just because I don't personally like something about the story doesn't mean that it is objectively bad; just because a character is unlikable doesn't mean that they are badly written. A good critic manages to put his subjective opinions and preferences aside and judge a work on its own merits. And this is where a problem with reviewing NGE arises.\nThere is no consensus in the anime community about any of the elements of Evangelion. Some things are certainly more controversial than the others, and there is at least some agreement among the vast majority about some things being genuinely good, but there's nothing, nothing that is universally acclaimed or consistently good about this series. There are such huge discrepancies between different parts of the series as a whole as well as its individual elements, and such conflicting views and opinions on it that seeking a second opinion will only additionally confuse those who are already confused and confounded after watching it for the first time. Therefore, it is practically impossible for a reviewer to use the opinions of others as a reference or a guideline in forming and presenting their own thoughts. Where some see brilliant writing and ingenious story-telling, others will see the exact opposite. Where one person sees great philosophical underpinnings, another person will see pretentiousness and shallow symbolism. \nAnd the biggest problem is that there's very little solid evidence to base your claims on and argue them, because the story itself is one giant ( and I dare say, contradictory ) mess no matter how you look at it ( some fans will claim that being a mess is the point of the story and that that's precisely where the genius lies, but a mess is still a mess ). \n---\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is described by virtually everyone as a ( brilliant ) deconstruction of the mecha genre. I personally dislike this genre and have almost no interest in it, seeing as it largely revolves around giant robots smashing and blasting each other to bits; not that there's anything inherently wrong with this, and many mecha series are very entertaining to watch, but I'm not really the target audience for the vast majority of these shows. Naturally, hearing that Evangelion is a deconstruction and a subversion of the principle tropes and themes of the genre piqued my interest, and the first few episodes and the final third of the show are certainly different from what you might expect from a mecha show. I do, though, confess to be relatively ignorant about the genre, having only seen the Patlabor films and a few episodes of Gundam and Code Geass. Most of my knowledge is “second hand“, i.e. from the internet ( wikipedia and TV tropes were my principle sources of information ), so I won't talk too much about which particular tropes were deconstructed and how ( not to mention it would probably be impossible to avoid spoilers in doing so ). \nThe principle point of its deconstruction of the genre in the latter third of the series was in switching the focus towards character development and thorough examination of human psyche and the implications of what effect would violent fights against monsters have on the minds of teenagers. And herein lies one of the main problems.\nEvangelion is largely lauded for its superb exploration of human psyche, and in particular the dissection and analysis of clinical depression and complete character breakdown. And I have to agree with this opinion, but only to an extent. Yes, Eva does a good job of exploring the psychology of its characters, but the way it does that and ( to a degree ) the content it handles are of questionable quality, to say the least. Why? Because it doesn’t do so through dialogue and by incorporating these examinations into a cohesive and meaningful story ( like Paranoia Agent does ). Instead, it opts for the “stream-of-thought” approach.\nStream of thought is not an easy method of narration to handle and is not well suited for a visual medium like anime, for it takes a great writer to execute it properly and incorporate it in the story that's being told. It should be pretty obvious to everyone why it is so: SHOW DON’T TELL! Anime is a visual medium, and the point of a visual medium is to show, not outright spell out for the audience what's going on inside someone's head. The \"stream-of-thought\" approach is not bad in itself, and while it works best in a written medium ( i.e. books ), there are numerous films and even anime that managed to pull it off brilliantly, but it completely destroys the flow of Eva’s story whenever it's inserted. There's basically two different ways to incorporate a monologuing \"stream of thought\" into a visual medium: a bad one and a worse one ( when it comes to weaving them in a story ), and Evangelion deploys both, much to its demise.\nFirst way is having a character go around, narrating their thoughts. Needless to say, these thoughts are mostly chaotic, random and the character spends a lot of time pondering things that are either some mundane everyday occurrences, or plot-related stuff that has already been made clear to the audience by their previous actions, which in turn makes these introspections completely redundant and annoying for the audience to sit through. If you want a stream-of-thought anime, make it 100% stream of thought, with a minimalistic plot and as few characters as possible, and focus exclusively on exploring the psyche of a single character. Granted, the narration and the story being told will suffer a lot, and the end product will not exactly be a thrill-ride, but it will have integrity and actual quality. \"The Tatami Galaxy\" uses this approach and the end result is much better than Evangelion.\nThe second way of employing a stream of thought is the navel-gazing in a void. This method is much more difficult to pull off than the first one because it requires the writer to justify halting the plot completely and abruptly moving the story inside a character's head. Evangelion fails to adequately justify its sudden shifts to a world of nothingness inside which the characters talk with their own subconscious. There are several examples earlier in the series, but the last two episodes are the epitome of why this approach fails in Eva. These moments don't come across as natural, on the contrary; it's painfully obvious that the writer isn't interested in the story at all, and that he only wants to screw around his character's heads. Now, there's nothing wrong with picking the characters apart and exploring the depths of their mind, but endless navel-gazing is not the right approach - a good writer does this through dialogue; dynamic and exhaustive character interaction. Even if it’s awkward ( like in Ghost in the Shell ), it’s still infinitely better than having a character’s subconscious chat with him for half an episode.\nBut the greatest downside in Eva's approach to analysing its character's psyche isn't even what or how, bur the content itself, what it persents: these introspections and analyses are written TEXTBOOK-STYLE. Again: \"Show don't tell!\". The show doesn't know whether to treat the audience as mature and intelligent adults or as less mature and averagely intelligent kids/teens who have to be taught the basic workings of a human mind. We are repeatedly told things that are painfully clear to everyone older than 14 ( “I am formed through my interactions with others...” – well, fuck-a-doodle-do, thanks for telling me that show, I never would have known! ), we are told things about the characters that *we already know* because of what they said/did earlier, in the real world. We learn nothing new about the characters in this void, as the show keeps going in circles. \nBut maybe that's the point - maybe it's not about the audience learning anything new, maybe it's about the characters learning something about themselves? But once again, we hit a brick wall, because the characters keep going in circles for episodes and episodes and episodes.\nThey aren't 100% consistent, the changes in their personalities are sometimes too abrupt and sudden to be natural and they often react unnaturally to some situations. Case in point: when Shinji's navel-gazing during the last two episodes, he is apparently shown a scene of Misato having sex with Kaji. To this her spirit/Shinji’s mental projection/whatever reacts not by blushing and averting her eyes, not by trying to cover Shinji's eyes to prevent him from seeing it, not by trying to justify herself. She breaks down into tears and sobs violently. She feels deeply and completely ashamed of herself. Why?! Unless she was engaging in extremely perverted s&m activities or something similar, why would she be so deeply embarrassed? I get that she would feel very uncomfortable if someone were to see her in such intimate and delicate moments, but sex is a natural thing and doesn't cause people to feel like lowliest scum for doing it. If she were a promiscuous nymphomaniac trying to fill a void in her heart by sleeping with an army of men, then I would understand. But she herself says that she only ever slept with Kaji, so what the hell?!\nNo matter how good or exhaustive psychological analysis of characters in Evangelion is, they ultimately lead nowhere, because the characters ( and in particular, Shinji ) fail to learn a valid lesson out of it all, and never make a stand for anything. The conclusion/solution/whatever that Shinji finally comes to at the end of ep 26 is bollocks ( if you would pardon my French ). The \"answer\" he finds is that objective reality or external perspective is meaningless, and that all that matters is \"how he feels about himself\". This brings me back about my statement about characters running in circles, and it perfectly shows how ultimately pointless all that psychology is; without proper philosophy ( instead of post-modernist existentialist bullshit we get ) to justify it and give it a purpose, Eva's endless digging in the pit of psychology is meaningless.  \nThe main problem with general characterisation in NGE is that is shifts so much and so often, and that it is executed so confusingly at times, that I honestly can't tell whether the characters were lazily written or perfectly formed. The shifts in personalities and sudden revelations of their mysterious pasts and present motivations are not completely natural, with almost zero foreshadowing that would make the transitions more natural and believable. Still, I am willing to give NGE the benefit of doubt, and credit where it’s due; the focus on Shinji and the decision to keep digging deeper and deeper into his and others’ mind is probably just how Anno honestly thought, and what he genuinely felt was worth exploring, and I can see that and appreciate it. Obviously many people must have found something true and worthwhile about it, or Eva would have never been such a milestone in both Japan and the rest of the world. However, while Anno is a smart man and knows quite a bit about psychology, he's just completely incapable of incorporating his characters and their deconstructions into a consistent and cohesive story. His depression and the chaos that was destroying Gainax from within only served to exacerbate the problems in the series, resulting in a mess that was the last third of the series ( and subsequently, the End of Evangelion movie ).\n--- \nThe problems of executing character development and exploring the psychological troubles of the cast also translate to the plot. There's the aforementioned halting of the plot for the sake of navel-gazing, but the circumstances leading to these monologues and the events causing the break-down of certain, if not all, characters, are incredibly contrived, and the “plot“ in the last third of the series is terribly rushed, convoluted and doesn't add up in any way. \nThe series starts as dark, edgy, and a lot of time was dedicated to flashing out different characters and showing just how stressful and dangerous piloting a mecha actually is, and the events do take strain on the main character. Shinji's angst and the occasional quasi-scientific babbling aside, they were good. \nStarting with episode 5/6, NGE temporarily discards its dark tone and focus on the implications of having children pilot giant robots and fight huge monsters with a killer instinct, and instead transitions into a much more “generic“ and familiar mecha show of a monster-of-the-week-format, while introducing some new characters along the way. And to tell you the truth, this is actually the best executed part of the entire series.\nAs I said, with episode 5/6 Evangelion takes a turn for the monster-of-the-week style, and it definitely works to its advantage. Almost every new episode features a new Angel attacking the city and the Eva pilots and their NERV commanders having to find a way to repel the attack and destroy the Angel. Each of these alien monsters is very unique, both in their designs and their special abilities and attacks, and the human forces always have to come up with a new ingenious plan to defeat them. Angels can range from humanoid monsters similar to Evas themselves to a giant floating diamond to extremely abstract and unconventional forms like shadows or nanobots. The fights between Evas and Angels are very entertaining to watch, and are played out in many different and interesting ways; battles can range from synchronised dancing to fighting the Angels in cyber-space.\nCharacter development is not forsaken during this period, though, on the contrary – many characters who were introduced over the course of the first few episodes, as well as some of the newcomers, get their chance to shine. Almost all of the battles are used to further develop the main cast of characters, several of them being “token episodes“ during which the focus on the story clearly shifts to a particular character rather than following Shinji, the protagonist. Development is executed either through long and revealing dialogue or the more tedious “let me tell you my life story“ moments ( okay, I'm exaggerating it a bit here, but the point still stays ), and occasionally we get a flash-back or two revealing their pasts and providing some more information ( and questions ) about the cataclysmic Second Impact and the character's involvement in the story. \nThe technical aspects of the show were also at their high point during this period. Aside from the recognisable and original designs of Evangelions ( even if they were very impractical and unrealistic ), the art was average, but the animation was of the highest quality at the time, and it still looks decent today. Intense and clever battles between the Evas and the Angels were a joy to watch, always dynamic and consistently good. \nThe soundtrack is not particularly special, but it sets the mood and tone for each scene perfectly, using a combination of eclectic and/or minimalistic pieces for more personal and mundane scenes, and employing epic ( and even a bit pretentious ) orchestral pieces and choirs for the awesome fight scenes.\nAnd there's the.. greatest opening theme song of all time.\nHowever, while it is technically the strongest part of the show, with some decent character development and beautifully choreographed fight scenes, this is also when Eva's ( potential ) problems start to become more apparent.\nFor starters, the repetitive and episodic monster-of-the-week format visibly slows down the plot. There is next to no sense of urgency or impending doom and the tone is never really dark. With each Angel that Evas defeat the feeling of threat or danger is further eroded and the fights, while entertaining, are not that suspenseful, as you know that they're going to defeat it in the end and that everything will be fine. It is possible that this was intentional seeing as the show takes a turn in the opposite direction in the latter episodes, but that's also debatable.\nThe second problem that arises is also plot-related. While the plot itself almost stops, the build-up does not. Every now and then a new mystery is introduced or hinted at, more cryptic clues and plot points are brought up, the secret background of the Eva Project and the existence of both NERV and their enemies, Angels, are slowly revealed, a micrometer at the time. This keeps the audience interested in the story as we expect the show to eventually deliver on its promises and expose the hidden truth behind everything. And this is where Evangelion's ultimate sin lies.\nIt doesn't deliver. In any way. \nReasons for the complete disintegration of the story and its characters in the last third of the series largely lie in the real world: by episode 16, which signaled a shift from a conventional action-oriented mecha series towards a psychological deconstruction of the genre, Studio Gainax was in disarray. They were way behind schedule, quickly running out of money and the tensions between the staff started to effect the series itself. In a way, the break-down of the characters and the story mirrors the break-down of the production crew, most importantly the writer, Anno.\nEven after it starts its gradual downward spiral in episode 16, and even when it gets positively disturbing in episodes 18 and 19, the show never manages to build upon the shock factor and deliver in an even remotely satisfying and logical way. Questions keep piling up and virtually none of the old ones are answered, at least not fully or satisfyingly.\nPlot twist and sudden revelations are so rushed and contrived they aren't believable or convincing at all; just cheap and convoluted cop-outs by the writer who at this point clearly has no idea how to conclude the story. \nEpisode 24 in particular was a spectacular mess, and even though ep 25 & 26 were horrible, I personally consider ep 24 to be the worst one in the entire series. It introduced a completely new character out of the blue, 2 episodes before the ending, tried to build up a deep and strong relationship between this new character and the protagonist in under 10 minuted, only to ditch him in the end of the same episode. \"Mess\" is the only word that can describe these last 10 episodes. \nThe visuals weren't spared either. Somewhere between ep 16 and 18, the previously high ( I dare say, impressive ) production values nosedived, resulting in (in)famous elevator and Eva scenes, although there were dozens of other long still shots as well. \nIt is pretty clear that the studio was in complete disarray, and when the production crew are fighting each other, being way behind schedule and broke, you can hardly expect even a half-decent story.\nAnd if all of this weren't enough already, Anno decided to give the audience a middle finger in episodes 25 and 26, which at this point are so infamous they have probably created a rupture in space-time continuum, allowing Anno to recreate his pathetic mess of a story over and over.\n---\nIt is time for me to sum up the review and pass my final judgement on Evangelion.\nAll in all, Eva is not a bad anime. But it's not a very good one either. There's some good parts and elements in it, but there's also plenty of crap in it as well, and due to the nature of the downsides, the series as a whole is less then a sum of its parts. \nThe first two thirds were quite enjoyable, and I'd take the action packed monster-of-the-week episodes over the philosophy and introspection of the last third of the series any day. After a strong start and a decent progression, Evangelion slowly spiraled into a incomprehensible mess after episode 16, culminating in the historical mind-fuck that was the series' “finale“ in episodes 25 and 26. \nAll that was good and had potential in Evangelion was pulverised and thrown in the gutter by that last third of the series. The plot was left almost completely unresolved, the characters disintegrated, animation followed the pattern, the soundtrack tried to compensate by becoming even more pretentious than before, half the time was spent navel-gazing and philosophising in the void... everything became a giant mess that largely undid the previous good parts. I won't even discuss the pointless and shallow religious symbolism that was prevalent throughout the series. \nAgain, I'm not saying that Eva is bad or that its psychological aspects are bad, for there is a lot of good stuff there that was just handled bad.. Which is why I'm so bitter with Eva - it had such a load of promise and potential for greatness, but it ended up shooting itself in the foot and screwing everything that was good about it. It could have been brilliant, and in the end turned out to be mediocre, and that's what bugs most people about it.\nI’m not even giving it a final average score, for as I said, I don’t consider myself fully qualified to give it an objective mark.\nWhat I will do is give you a recommendation, as the themes and gimmicks of Eva have been done before and after, and they've been done better. \n- If you want an entertaining mecha show, watch \"Rahxephon\", which is basically a carbon copy of Eva, only with a protagonist that actually has a spine, angst replaced with a good romance and with an ending that doesn't have its head stuck up its own arse. You can also try \"Code Geass\".\n- If you want a show about existential questions and unconventional answers to them, involving a move to a \"higher plane of existence\", try the 1995 movie \"Ghost in the Shell\" or the \"Serial Experiments Lain\", both of them being immensely smarter and more consistent than Eva\n- If you want a thorough psychological examination of the human mind, watch “Paranoia Agent” by Satoshi Kon\n- If you want a dark, psychological deconstruction of an existing genre, \"Puella Magi Madoka Magica\" is infinitely better than Eva could ever hope to be. To put it simple: everything that Eva does wrong, Madoka Magica does right, and then some. “Madoka” is everything that Evangelion should have been, but sadly, isn’t."},

The news that day was that they were able to upload Neon Genesis Evangelion, a 1995 TV series that was apparently a very influential piece of the Mecha genre. Intrigued by the description I decided to check out the title, completely blind. That was my introduction to the inevitability of Evangelion, possibly the most divisive anime ever made. \nBy the score you probably guessed already my\n          \n        stance in regards to the series: I don’t like Evangelion, I didn’t like it when I first watched, knowing little to nothing about it, and I don’t like now that I have better critical mindset. However, I’m not beyond admitting when the series does something right. I write these self-indulgent pieces called Reviews when I think I have something at least mildly interesting to say about the work and I believe I can give my 2 cents to the discussion in the fairest manner I can pull off. A little warning, though: discussing the most contemptuous points about Neon Genesis Evangelion is difficult without spoiling anything, so I’ll try to comment about late events without giving the most spoilerific information away, all the while trying to make my points as clear as possible.\nStory and Characters\nBefore anything else, there are two important external factors necessary to understand when analyzing Neon Genesis Evangelion, as they had massive influence during the production of the TV series (the movie is a beast for another time). The first is the role of director Anno Hideaki, the main creative force behind Evangelion, the second are the budget constraints that plagued the series and lead to some of the more controversial decisions that created the massive split in opinions the series is known for. Firstly, director Anno Hideaki is a person that has dealt with depression in many instances of his life and is, according to second-hand information and some interviews, someone with a very low opinion about himself. When the time slot for Evangelion was pitched to him, Anno and Gainax were in a period of failure in which the studio tried various projects that were never able to get off the ground. Rumors even tell that he was at a bar, drinking to escape his depressive state, when the idea was offered.  The budget issues we’ll discuss along the review, so for now let’s understand how Anno’s emotional condition at the time affected the conception of Evangelion. \nInitially, the series was conceptualized to be a deconstruction  of the Mecha genre, bent on straying from the escapism centered narratives provided by the anime media. For those not in the know, a deconstruction is, in fiction, a work or character designed to break apart and analyze the tropes that make traditional examples of said genre or archetype. The common method of doing so is by inserting realistic outcomes the different elements of the genre would have if the setting followed the rules of the conventional world, a notable example being the graphic novel Watchmen. Works of this nature tend, but are not limited, to be very dark in tone. Having that in mind, makes sense that Evangelion would take to a very unusual level the depiction of unstable young teenagers having to pilot immensely powerful mechs to defend humanity from a mysterious threat, as well as exploring in depth the mental and emotional problems derived from that role. However, this very nature opens the work to some criticisms that works that follow the genre straight are not victim of, as the suspension of disbelief dispensed to a deconstruction is tighter. By watching Evangelion you can raise questions like:\n-	Why were NERV’s headquarters built under a populated city, putting in danger the lives of innocent people and exponentially raising collateral damage, especially when the Angels seem drawn to the Eva Units?\n-	Why aren’t the pilots offered psychological assistance, given the immense levels of pressure they suffer, as well as mental and emotional scars the fight against the Angels bring them?\n-	Why doesn’t NERV share at least some of its technology with the military, so that they can pose a threat to the Angels too?\n-	Why there are tits and a boner joke on my deconstruction?\nBy the way, I know \"deconstruction\" has become somewhat of a dirty word now, but fans and critics have been using it for a  while and it fits, so I'm gonna use it too. Before I get ahead of myself though, let’s talk about the characters:\nIkari Shinji is the main protagonist of the series, the pilot of Eva Unit 01 and the one the internet is more used to bash for being a “pussy”. Introspective, socially awkward, extremely afraid of rejection, full of self-pity  and having massive difficult to express himself, he makes clear that he only pilots the Eva because people tell him to, and in some instances seems to try forcing his acceptance onto others. Shinji is the center of the majority of discussions about Evangelion, either hailed by supporters of the series as a realistic representation of someone with depression and low self-esteem or bashed by its detractors as the rock that holds the anime from improving. Now, before you jump on me, let me tell you I actually believe Shinji is the least of the problems with the series. I’d even risk saying the he is in fact a very good character, but one that is handled particularly bad by his own series. All of his issues at the beginning of Evangelion are grounded, realistic and believable, and his development doesn’t take long to appear. The issue is how that development is handled during the anime’s second half, which we’ll discuss in due time.\nKatsuragi Misato is the commanding officer in charge of orienting the pilots during the battles against the Angels, as well as the main caretaker for Shinji and Asuka. Having contrasting personalities when at work and at home, being professional and quick on thought in the former, but carefree and irresponsible in the latter, she plays major role at Shinji’s development, being the first one to try to form a connection with the boy and give him better motivations to fight, besides simply obeying orders. She is also the character with the most fully realized character-arc during Evangelion’s first run and the only figure the anime doesn’t shit on by the end. Early on, it’s introduced the idea of the Hedgehog Dilemma, in which the closer people with deep-rooted emotional issues try to get, the more they risk hurting each other. This dilemma is the main topic for Misato’s relationship with Shinji during the first four episodes.\nThe next pilot is Ayanami Rei, the first children chosen to pilot the Evas, and responsible for Unit 00. Rei is the least problematic of the pilots, both in the context of the story and among the debates sprung from the anime. Considered the prototype for all kuuderes, Rei is quiet, reserved, keeps herself distant from most social interaction, seeming to only open up to Shinji’s father, and generally holds her own life in very low regard. These traits are originated from one particular information about her origins that I cannot spoil, but one can always question the level of realism of her depiction. According to Anno, her purpose in the story was to show the audience how unsettling it is to face an emotionless being, basically a character that could personify the Uncanny Valley.\nAsuka is the second children and the pilot of Eva Unit 02. She is brash, outspoken, eager for attention and to show herself, and packs a massive superiority complex, underneath of which lies her deep-rooted need for praise, in order to keep her self-esteem up. Asuka’s introduction in episode 08 marks a shift in mood to the series, as from the point she appears, NGE develops a campy mood, closer to traditional Monster of the Week shows. It’s actually a very natural root to take. At this point, while old personal struggles are still present in the cast and some of them are yet to be introduced, Shinji is a lot more comfortable with his new living situation and his role as a pilot, so, while the serious stakes remain, the series is considerably lighter at this point than in the “hedgehog dilemma” days. This is also the segment of the anime that features the most frequent use of sexual fanservice, or cheesecake if you prefer, which by itself is not a problem (I’m not that much of a hypocrite), but will bring up an issue, in comparison to other aspect I’ll comment later at this review.\nIkari Gendo is Shinji’s father and the main reason for the boy’s issues. Having abandoned the son right after the death of his wife, Gendo displays little to no interest for him, is completely driven by his objectives as the head NERV, acts arrogant and doesn’t take much time on making decisions that might often put in danger the lives or mental stability of the pilots, quite often in ways that can only be described as plot-driven stupidity. The only person Gendo seems to be relatively worried about is Rei, as indicated in the event when he rushed to take her out of the Eva Plug, burning his hands in the process, and by the more tender expression he exhibits when talking to her.\nKaworu is the final pilot introduced in the series, but his appearance comes very late, making in depth descriptions difficult without spoilers. He’s strongly drawn to Shinji, seeming to have deep understanding of his emotional state. Not knowing the secret of his character, though, that fact gives their interaction strong homosexual undertones. Well, if you can call that “undertone”, anyway.\nOther characters that play important roles would be Ritsuko, head-scientist responsible to keep the Eva Units working and later the anime’s punching bag, Kaji, a man that shares a romantic past with Misato and plays a dubious role dealing with important information for NERV, and Fuyutsuki, second in command in NERV and main advisor for Gendo.\nThe first half of Evangelion is the part I consider worthy of genuine praise. Sure, it soon assumes campier tone than it had at the beginning, but the psychological themes are far less blatant and still stealthily addressed, as they should be. This is also the point where character development is implemented in its most effective and subtle form. For once, it doesn’t take much for Shinji to stop imposing his acceptance to others and under the influence of Misato’s early support he soon starts attempting genuine interaction with the people around him. While piloting Unit 01, he also becomes much more focused, internally compelled to improve at the job and quicker to take action. He’s, off course, still socially awkward, a trait that becomes noticeable when confronted by Asuka’s upfront demeanor. Asuka also plays the role of a conflicting force to Shinji stern from the fact that he’s still a teenage boy and those hormones gotta go somewhere. While the boy is drawn to her appearance, he is also turn away by her personality and his own lack of social skills. This subject, however, unfortunately ends up being forgotten as the series progresses.\nRei, in the other hand, doesn’t display any interest in strengthening the relationship with other characters, but becomes slightly more receptive to interactions others initiate with her, as shown by Shinji being visibly confortable in conversations with the girl. She’s still very inexpressive, though. Being someone with little personal motivational to pilot the Eva, she becomes an object of contempt to Asuka, who pilots in order to gather external approval from others. Asuka becomes increasingly spiteful of Rei, as she can’t accept that someone like her gets recognition and attention from her superiors without attempting so. Even Shinji’s confortable expression while talking to Rei is a point of contempt for her. As you can see, Asuka’s character arc is a downward spiral, the “conclusion” of which will see at the second half. The last bits of this segment of the story are the ones most focused on driving home the motivations of the pilots, while giving hints of deeper issues.\nBefore moving on, it’s important that I address the religious symbolism present in Evangelion. This is a target of criticism for many, as they believe it makes the show pretentious, since the symbolism doesn’t play a role in the story itself. You can extract from the series a commentary about how humanity uses science to challenge the Higher Power, be it God, fate or simply the inevitability of death. The symbolism, however, plays no role in that commentary and is used only for aesthetic purposes. This might surprise you, but I don’t consider this an issue. Japan’s culture is barely influenced by Judeo-Christian principles, being instead influenced by Shintoism and Buddhism. Biblical references for Japanese authors are not too different from what Greek or Nord mythology is for the West.\nOk, Evangelion fanbase, you had your 6 episodes of fun with Asuka, but now it’s time to talk about the real meat of the issues with the series, its second half. The problem with addressing the issues at this part of the series is that they are not standalone problems, they merge until they create one single monstrous beast with several heads. In fairness, it doesn’t start all that menacing: episode 14 is part recap, but soon it goes back to the regular format. What this episode does is to signalize a mood-shift and foreshadow heavier emphasis on Seele, the organization that oversees NERV, and the Human Instrumentality Project. From this point on, Evangelion would feature significantly different mood, structure (again!) and severe problems with character consistency. It’s also here that Kaji becomes a prominent character in the story, although it calls attention to the question of what exactly is his role on the plot. All of that in mind, let’s start with the simpler issue, the Mind Trips.\nFor mind trips, I refer to the segments where characters would go to hallucinations where the majority of the issues they faced up to that point are regurgitated at them. These segments also feature some exposition about backstory, which leads me to ask: couldn’t this be exposed in more graceful manners? The first one, at episode 14, is fairly harmless, featuring Rei inside the Eva Plug, making vague definitions about random objects and some of the characters. It’s possibly a hint to the real nature of her character, but this possibility is unclear. The issue starts when we move to the other pilots, most notably Shinji. Now, up to this point, Shinji’s character development was pretty much set, what the series needed to do was to continue expanding on it and address the issues the boy had not faced yet and he would have a complete and rounded arc, going from a simple and depressed kid caught up in events much bigger than himself to a competent Unlikely Hero. The mind trips, however, work in contradiction with this development. In them, Shinji is displayed as he was in his Hedgehog Dillema days, in complete opposition to his behavior and natural demeanor outside of these sequences. In some points they try to actively disregard that development. Do you want an example? In episode sixteen, during his first mind trip, Shinji utters the following line:\n“I already had my happy moments and just tried to hold on to them. Is there something wrong with that?”\nThat is a very good question, is there something wrong with that? By holding to those happy moments is how he was able to improve and become truly effective as a pilot and meaningful as a character. What is even more obnoxious is that these segments have no effect on his depiction in the real world, only serving to stagnate his development up until the end of the series. Meanwhile, Asuka continues her downward character arc. Her progress is, interestingly enough, inversely proportional to how Shinji develops alongside with her: as the boy becomes increasingly prominent as a pilot, she becomes more frustrated by the growing competition and the likelihood of facing opposition in her fight for attention and praise. Her mind trips come in to expose her past, where we can see the reasons for her low self-esteem and obsessive need for validation, essentially stuff that could be featured in a flashback, as well as allow for narrative padding. Just for clarification, I’m not implying that pessimistic character development is a bad thing. Part of the fun in Black Lagoon is witnessing Rock’s gradual loss of his good-will while traveling to the darkness of Roanapur and, if you want an example outside of anime, Will Munny, from The Unforgiven, is a man trying his best to be a decent person, but still has to cope with the fact he’s someone with a scary and violent nature. The issue here is that those were complete character arcs, while for Asuka’s case, just like other points I talked about, we’ll have to discuss while tackling the final episodes.\nMoving on. Remember when I mentioned that Gendo seems to suffer from plot-driven stupidity at key events? That is not exclusive to him, as in several instances multiple characters will hold the idiot ball for the sake of progressing the narrative. This is a a common situation for when a writer wants to include an specific plot point in the story but has no proper set up to do so, resorting to make the characters act stupid so that such set up can be achieved. Let’s discuss some of those instances. For starters, there’s the ever-lingering question of why there aren’t psychologists available to help the pilots. These are clearly people under severe mental and physical stress and since one suffered from depression from the beginning, one is almost completely detached from human interaction and the last one is in a downward spiral of self-hatred and need for approval, all factors that heavily influence their performance at the job, the dire need for mental assistance for those kids becomes increasingly more apparent. Some might say I shouldn’t think too much about it, but remember: this is a deconstruction, it’s supposed to be grounded in a realistic setting, just including out-of-this-world elements.\nNow going to a case-by-case take, one of the main arcs of the second half involves the fourth children selected to pilot the Evas, responsible for Unit 03. The problems arrive when Unit 03 goes rogue due to being infected by an Angel (these things seem to gain abilities based on what is convenient for the episode) and the pilots are sent to take care of it. When the responsibility comes to Shinji to fight Unit 03, he freezes because there’s a person inside the Eva and he fears harming them. At no point comes to his mind to just immobilize Unit 03, neither any of his superiors gives him that idea. This leads Gendo to order the activation of the Dummy Plug, a project he knows still has problems to be fixed and whose efficiency is uncertain. In the following sequence Unit 01, under the control of the Dummy Plug, proceeds to brutalize Unit 03, far beyond the point it was necessary, without Gendo ever ordering it to cease the attack. This whole sequence is designed for shock factor, to lead the audience to feel repulse by what’s happening on screen, ignoring the lack of logic. It culminates when Unit 01 rips off and destroys the plug. Apparently Gendo decided they didn’t need that pilot anymore, either that or he’s an outstanding idiot.\nSee? It took me 6 pages of text to finally have a problem with Shinji.\nBesides shock factor, another purpose for this event is to lead Shinji to rebel against Gendo, reviving the tension between them. It’s hard to reprove the boy for the attitude, though, since most of what happened was due to Gendo’s incompetence at commanding. When he comes back, he’s displaying even better resolve to fight them before the incident, and coupled with how little of that is mentioned in the rest of the series, the whole Unit 03 arc becomes effectively pointless. After Shinji’s return, we’re lead to the events of episode 20, which also has minimal relevance to the progression of the story, since soon after that comes a flashback detailing Fuyutsuki’s past in relation with Gendo and the Second Impact. Hell, not even Shinij seems bothered by the absurd experiences he just went through.\nActually relevant stuff starts happening right after, as Asuka’s descent is leading her to get progressively worse synchronization rates with Unit 02. Since nobody does absolutely nothing to solve that, while still placing her in scenarios where maximum efficiency was needed, she ends up in a situation where her life, or at least her mental stability, is in serious danger. None of the people at NERV comes with the idea of ejecting Unit 02’s plug, a method they’ve resorted several times up to this point, in order to save her. Why? I mean, besides artificially raising the tension without it being earned. Later, they continue to send her to combat, resulting in a situation where her synchronization is so low she can’t even move the Eva anymore.\nBefore moving on to the final stretch, where I’ll talk about the series final episodes, I’d like to address the shift in mood taken by the anime on its second half. I mentioned before about how the fanservice present in the first half was not an issue at the time, but this is the point where it becomes an issue. The mood in the series becomes progressively darker and some particular scenes, specially one from episode 23 (you know which one), have potentially disturbing content, and compared to the fanservice and campy atmosphere from the first half it gives the anime an very uneven tone. The bleakness of tone stretches all around, reaching even secondary characters. Remember when I commented the character of Ritsuko becomes the punching bag of the series? Up to this point, she was a character with importance to the plot and noticeable characterization, but essentially a secondary figure, with no relevance to any of the themes and only needed to keep the plot going, and she was good that way. In the final episodes, though, she basically retreads the exact same path of misery faced by her mother, detailed in episode 21, only to be moved away from the plot for the remaining episodes and become irrelevant. Unlike works like Trigun, where the tone shift works to test the protagonist’s morals and allow him to come off as a fully rounded figure, or even Shingeki no Kyojin, where the brutal outcomes serve to emphasize the resolve the humans have to achieve their goal, this is not misery for the sake of advancing a character arc or improving the plot, it’s just characters being miserable for no purpose, and in the words of GoatJesus, if it doesn’t play a purpose, why have it at all?\nWith Asuka falling to her deepest depressive state and the introduction of Kaworu, the series has its climax at episode 24. The two remaining episodes are the biggest source of diversion when discussing Evangelion. For once, they are giant mind trips. It’s supposed to take place after Gendo has initiated the Human Instrumentality Project and merged all of humanity under one collective conscience. How the project was initiated or what were the pieces for triggering it is left unexplained, the episodes simply start in the mind trip and no proper context is given until the information that Human Instrumentality began comes up. It’s clear that it was at this point during production that the budget expenses reached their limit and Gainax was forced to compromise, bringing this as the result. For the remaining 40 minutes of the series, it’s just a dream sequence where the emotional issues of the characters are retreaded and blatantly spelled out without ceremony or the least shred of subtlety. Asuka appears in her pre-decay persona to spout why she’s so eager for attention, Shinji reminisces his issues with rejection and even Misato, who had a complete character arc at this point, reinforces her Elektra Complex when she was supposed to have come to terms with it already. At this point something finally came to my mind: Anno was able to create the basic state of his characters and the problems they would face very well, but he was not able to make them properly deal with such problems. That is why there's such a disconnect between Shinji's portrayal in the real world and in the mind trips, the characters in Evangelion are not able to fully develop their issues towards a solution, only being capable of flat out explaining them, without sublety. After many divagations, with characters bringing up philosophical concepts to replace more pertinent psychological matters, the series comes to an end with Shinji’s epiphany, in which he concludes:\n“But maybe I can learn to love myself. Maybe my life has a greater value. Yes, I’m no one besides myself. I am me, I want to be myself. I want to continue existing in this world. I’m worthy of living here!”\nAnd THAT is the problem with the ending of Neon Genessis Evangelion: it’s not the resolution of the numerous character arcs and plot points raised, but the acceptance of stagnation, the simple possibility of a conclusive development without truly having one. At this point, I have to ask: Why is this acceptable? Why is uncertainty preferable over closure? Let’s take a look at some questions that were left unresolved:\n-	What really are the Angels?\n-	Who was Kaji really working for and what were his objectives?\n-	What was Seele’s objective with the Human Instrumentality Project?\n-	If Both Seele and Gendo want the Human Instrumentality Project, why there’s so much animosity between them?\n-	What is the origin of the Dead Sea Manuscripts, or even their nature itself?\n-	What was the fate of Asuka and Ritsuko?\n-	How did Seele “find” Kaworu?\nAnd before you tell me that the series is not about these mysteries, but about the issues characters face, let me stop you, because Evangelion built a sizeable chunk of its appeal on these questions. For the last 11 episodes, give or take depending on your perspective, the audience has watched ever-increasing pain plaguing the main cast, but unlike something like Berserk, for example, where the horror of what is happening to the characters is compensated by the full realization of multiple character arcs, as well as the conclusion to an event that has been foreshadowed through the entire series, here the audience is rewarded with vagueness and uncertainty.\nPresentation\nWell, here is the boring part of the review.\nOk, everyone knows by now of the effects the budget limitations had on Evangelion’s presentation, but before we get into that, let’s talk a little about what are really strong moments for the visuals display in the series. For once, cinematography is excellent. Multiple scenes feature various meaningful details, giving away subtle information that could not be included in the dialogue, and when there’s little time for details, and framing is effectively used to convey the emotions of the scene. There was a clear understanding among Gainax that animation is also a tool for storytelling and not just a fun way of putting images on a screen. A sequence like Shinji entering Misato’s apartment for the first time could be just a bland moment unimportant for the story, but is used to emphasize the importance of the decision the two are about to make and, in the same vein, lighting also plays a big role in moments of dialogue, helping establish the mood for the scene. Colorization is usually realistically applied, not counting the traditional oddly-colored hair-styles, with mostly pale colors applied throughout the enviroment, but good care is put into making what is important pop in the screen, from relevant characters to information about the action and, obviously, the action itself.\nAside from the traditional methods used by studios to cut corners in animation, the symptoms of the decreasing budget appear distinctively in two areas, one being the long stretches of static imagery, where time was really moving and, no, your computer did not freeze while you were watching it (for real, I once thought that was the case). Oddly enough, there are people who argue that those moments of absolutely nothing happening are what add to the artistic intent of the story. To them I say “stop inserting meaning where there isn’t any”, there is nothing there that really needed a minute and a half to achieve what could be done in ten seconds. The other practice that made the money issue noticeable was the reuse of footage and in no place is that more apparent than in, again, the mind trip sequences. During such sequences the amount of reused frames was too much to count and details on screen were kept to a minimum. Unsurprisingly, those were also the instances where the cinematography also took a nose-dive in quality.\nNow to the sound: I watched the series subbed, because off course, that how I do it. The performances in Japanese are nothing to complain about. Shinji’s voice work is nowhere near as annoying as his western counterpart, playing a much more subdued tone when away from the intense sequences, Asuka is, in the other hand, just the right degree of annoying she should be, but smoothly transitioning to lower tones when the character reaches her lower points, and Rei is… well, Rei. Fun fact: the voice actress for Rei was Hayashibara Megumi, the same one who played Faye Valentine in Cowboy Bebop. The opening is the iconic Zankoku na Tenshi no Teeze, or Thesis of a Cruel Angel, an extremely catchy song, but I’d also advise you to look for the lyrics, which is very compelling and fitting for Shinji’s character. The ending is a rendition of Fly me to the Moon, which is not really my kind of music, but if it’s yours, good enough.\nPersonal Ramblings\nAs harsh as I might have sounded in this review, I want to make it clear that I didn’t do this to diminish and lash out against fans of the series or to provide ego-boosting to detractors, I’m not ThatAnimeSnob. I wrote it with the purpose of showing my perspective, the perspective of someone who went into the series open minded and willing to take the most out of it, but came out disheartened by clumsy writing wasting away solid potential. I bet 19-year-old me really wanted to like Neon Genesis Evangelion. Besides what my favorites list might indicate, I’m all for appreciating what is old and influent in a media and that was one of my biggest drives while going into the series for the first time.\nUnfortunately, by the end of it I could just repeat to myself: If only! If only the tone was kept consistent throughout the whole series; if only the unnecessary plot points were discarded in favor of tightening the script; if only the mysteries had been fully explored; if only the character dilemmas had been properly addressed and character arcs were completed; if only money was used to animate actually relevant plot-threads, giving the series the proper resolution it needed. Ironically, many of these problems are what makes Evangelion, to this day, such a divisive series and highly talked about subject, spawning countless interpretations and counterpoints. Perhaps if the series didn’t have all of the problems I discussed about and was a self-contained, complete story, it wouldn’t be nowhere near as influent and heated topic. Yes, its flaws are what make it memorable.\nEvangelion is inevitable by this point. It’s considered obligatory watch for any anime fan and the result is almost always a passionate inclination to either love it or hate it. Believe it or not, I used to dislike the series even more than I do now. There was a time where I couldn’t comprehend what people saw in the anime and my reaction to anyone who placed it among their favorites was “Really?” Nowadays I’ve grown to better understand their reasoning, even though I still stand by everything I said here. I even got to be far more forgiving to Shinji than most detractors of the series are. If you like Evangelion, if it’s your favorite anime and something you wholeheartedly cherish, here is what I have to say: it’s OK, that won’t lead me to have anything against you, I might even like you, but, by the end of the day, my opinion is still the one I trust in the first place.\nOh, one last thing: stop calling Asuka a Tsundere, she has no dere-side and only going halfway isn’t enough to fit the archetype!"},

Haters will try to convince you otherwise, but tell them Spike Spencer has a message for them and punch them in sack, and then proceed to watch the dub.\nThe basic plot of NGE is something like this, setting aside SEELE, AT Fields, Instrumentality, and all that fun stuff. Shinji Ikari, the 14 year old son of NERV commander Gendo Ikari, is called to NERV (an organization whose task is defending the goddamn world, for starters) by his dad in order to pilot a big ass Gundam (called an EVA) and fight against a Cthulhu-esque\n          \n        monster (otherwise known as an Angel) that's wrecking the shit out of Tokyo-3, after trying out some weak ass shit (like n2 mines, which are non-nuclear but equivalent to a nuclear bomb in strength) with little avail. As the first episodes establishes, the Angels are some bad motherfuckers, and the only things that can go toe to toe with them are the EVAs, who can only be piloted by the specific 14 year olds that are able to sync with them. From there you're introduced to the NERV staff, the other Eva pilots, and their classmates as the big damn heroes fight off the Angels, one by one...sort of. That's when shit gets real.\nIf the ending leaves you mindscrewed, there's a pretty popular Eva fanfic called The Bible that presents some of God's theories as to what went down in those last few episodes. It's an alright read, if a bit bombastic.\nThe artwork as a whole is pretty impressive, especially for both its time and the budget Gainax was on. Let's just not talk about those last two episodes though. As for the character designs, your millage may vary, but I thought Sadamoto did a pretty bitchin job on them (I have forgiven him for the manga).\nSound is pretty good, if a bit inappropriate at times. I heard Anno originally approached Yoko Kanno to do the soundtrack until Beethoven told her to fuck off and then proceeded to record the first OST. I wouldn't be surprised.\nAs for the characters, whoa. For starters, one area NGE does not break any new ground in is civil rights, as I couldn't find a single black guy in the show. Shinji is the biggest woman ever, and you'll probably want to get her into an armbar after the second episode; it only gets worse from there. Asuka, pre-character development, is your typical tsundere redhead, Rei is the emotionless girl who's gotta have blue hair, Misato is your best friend's hot older sister with boobs and a drinking problem, Gendo is a cold, manipulative bastard, Toji is Anno's night alone with Fist of the North Star, Kaji is an inferior Japanese knock off of James Bond, Ritsuko is Gendo's dummy plug if you catch my drift, Kaworu is Shinji's gay lover, SEELE are some secret spooky douchebags behind monoliths, and so on and so forth. The character development is actually well done though, and the series does a pretty good job of deconstructing a few standard anime character tropes (as well as the mecha genre in general, although this is another your millage may vary thing). It's not as revolutionary as NGE fanboys make it out to be, but it accomplishes what it sets out to do. Even if that is a few comas and a lot of homoerotic subtext.\nOverall, if you want to watch a guy mercilessly beat the shit out of his own characters physically and psychologically, complete with synchronized dancing, losers getting stomped by a group of 14 year old girls with big fucking mechas, cheesy religious symbolism, and the most infamous trainwreck ending in anime (although the entire second season of Code Geass gives it a run for its money), then this is the anime for you. Alternatively, you could watch Mars of Destruction, which is basically the same story except shorter and a lot more hilarious. The choice is yours.\n        "},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=57,   ["text"]="                          \n    This review is for both the series and two movies.\nThis overall is the worst anime series I've seen, and I've seen a lot of them.  There are many things wrong with the series and movies.\nFirst is the story.  It begins in the year 2000 when a disaster nearly destroys Antarctica and kills billions of people.  It's first thought to be a natural disaster, but was actually a experiment sponsored by a organization called SEELE and carried out by GEHIRN.  Fast forward to the year 2010 GEHIRN has changed into NERV a military organization.  NERV's primary mission is to locate creatures\n          \n        called Angles and destroy them.  The primary story follows Shinji Ikari who decides to join NERV and his father is the head of NERV. \nNow onto all the problems with this show.\nFirst is the story:  I'm not sure what the creators of this series/movies were trying to do, but they failed miserably.  The story as it went on from episode to episode and movie to movie just got worse and worse as it went a long.  The story was incoherent and didn't make any sense.  I don't mind series that try to have a hight meaning, but at least make some kind of sense at the end, express something even if it's that everyone dies.\nSecond the characters:  I think this might have been my biggest problem with the series.  The characters brought nothing to the series.  The main character Shinji has to be one of the worst if not the worst anime character ever.  He had no depth, emotion, and didn't try me in.  He was just annyoing, and I wanted him to die almost from the beginning, the same with most of the other ones.  I can't think of on character I actually liked.\nThird the animation:  The animation done by GAINAX is terrible it looks like something done by in the 60s or 70s.  Hell I think Speed Racer looks better than this series.\nOverall this is the worst anime series ever and most overrated series I've seen.  I really don't understand why people like it.  If they want to see a great anime series with meaning then you should check out series like Saikano, RahXephon, and Now and Then, Here and There just for example.  Just skip this series and movie, you'll life will be much better off. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=57,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Okay, first of all, let me explain some simple facts about my relationship with this anime:\n1)  This is my favorite anime of all time.  Ever.\n2)  This is the series that really got me into anime.  Thank you, JP.\n3)  This is the anime that KILLED whatever tiny scrap of mental innocence I had left by the 2nd semester of my freshman year.  I AM NOT KIDDING. \n4)  This anime drove me insane. If you let it, and you are that kind of person, it will do the same to you.  Don't worry, it's for your own good.\n5) \n          \n        No matter what anyone says, I LOVE the last two episodes.  They are the greatest thing ever.\n     Now then, on with the review.  This is truly a spectacular anime for quite a few reasons.  First of all, what I consider to be the fundamentals of any story, plot and characters.  The plot, while seemingly predictable at first, is far from it.  It is really about as twisted and insane as you can get before being pointless, which is  why it is so amazing.  \n     The characters are also completely believable, both by themselves and in their interactions with each other.  The great thing is that, unlike with a lot of anime characters *cough*like in Naruto*cough*, they are not merely stereotypes or stock characters, they are exquisitely multi-dimentional, and have feelings and compulsions like real people.  I can relate to all of them at different points, although Rei, who is my personal favorite, I relate to more frequently than the others.  Some of the characters are lovable, some pitiful, some loathsome (I have a love-hate relationship with Gendo), but they all suck you in.\n     In addition to having a wonderful story and characters, the art and sound in this anime is spectacular!  The art blew me away at first sight-and when I first saw it, I had NO idea it was from the 90s, so I find it even more incredible now.  It is of a caliber that I think is rarely seen now, let alone at that time period.  It is rich and colorful, with exquisite, clean lines, beautiful land- and cityscapes, and great details.  The designs of the Evas and the angels are some of the best I've ever seen.  For me the one oddity (not that I'm really complaing, 'cause it is hot) was the fact that Asuka's breasts seem to randomly get bigger whenever she put on a swimsuit!  My friend JP, who got me hooked on the series and was my supplier (he owns the DVDs), affirmed that for me, so I know I wasn't just seeing things.\n     The soundtrack is also beautiful, and really serves to emphasize the sheer insanity of the whole series. Especially in episode 24, with the bit with Shinji and Kaoru where they play Ode to Joy, although that title with that particular episode, and the series as a whole, makes me laugh because it is so very ironic.\n     I enjoyed watching this immensely.  I can only rate up to 10, but my enjoyment of it was really about 50,000.  I definitely recommend this series.  However, I must caution you.  THIS SERIES IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART.  It is not happy, fluffy kittens and pink clouds and sparkles and whatever else have you.  It is violent, bloody, tragic, and deeply psychological.  When I said that it destroyed my last scrap of innocence, I MEANT IT.  If you are not used to this kind of thing, and are rather timid in that area, I suggest leaving it alone, or finding some clips first (of the traumatic parts) to test the waters, as it were.  It is truly a horrifying anime.  Which is why, in my opinion, it is one of the best things ever created.  \n     So long, and thanks for taking the time to read this.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=43,   ["text"]="                          \n    Oh boy where to begin with this one? I could sit down and spend a couple hours dissecting this one, instead I think I'll skim through some points and opinions about the show that seem pretty prevalent throughout the community that have seen it.\nCHARACTERS: I feel like the characters are just like the Anime itself: You either love them or hate them (love/hate the show respectively.) There's not a whole lot of character development throughout the Anime, and by the end of the show the characters seem to maintain the same personality/traits even when they've been put through the trials and hardships they've endured. Maybe\n          \n        not Asuka.. Not sure since the ending was so lackluster..\nSHINJI IKARI: Well what to say about this, er.. Protagonist? In the beginning of the Anime he starts out as a whiny little b*tch, and by the end he seems to be exactly that, no progression into an awesome hero who saved the day by fighting giant monsters in a huge mecha suit saving the world. If you're a sucker for protagonists who are heros/heroines (like myself) you might not like the main character in the show that much, his ineptitude is a big part of who he is. I really enjoy Anime's where the main character has a lot of background and a strongly written personality, and you feel as if they were put into danger they could metal their way out. Not Shinji. Most of his lines are going to be,\n1. \"FATHER WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME\"\n2. \"I DON'T WANT TO PILOT THE EVA ANYMORE\"\n3. \"I CAN'T DO IT\"\n4. \"WHY DOES MY SKIRT KEEP BLOWING UP IN MY FACE\"\n5. \"MY VOICE IS CONSTANTLY STUCK IN A HIGH PITCH PRE-PUBESCENT SCREAM, AND IF YOU'VE WATCHED THE ANIME RECENTLY YOU'RE READING THIS IN HIS VOICE, WAAAA!\"\nHaha okay, okay, i'll be fair.. His character wasn't awful, and considering he's an emotionally wrought teenager who was abandoned by his father and grew up in a sort of post-apocalyptic world where monsters attack every Tuesday, you would expect someone to be like this, and I found myself at least somewhat caring for him, I think... :\\nASUKA: She's the female character in the Anime that's, \"over the top\", \"Facetious\", \"Pretentious\".. That's the first thing that comes to everyone's mind with this character I think.. Half the time she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and more so at Shinji than not. If Shinji's personality is boring and lackluster, the writers made up for it with Asuka's personality, albeit maybe a little over the edge. She's the type of girl you would date but would never want to be in a relationship with (don't stick your d*ck in crazy folks). Most of her scenes she's fun and out going, maybe a little annoying. \"SHINJI!!\"\nAlright I could dissect each character and list the pros/cons, but the two characters I reviewed seem to have a lot of screen time, and a strange personality to write about. I enjoyed Misato's character and by the time I was 10 episodes in or so, I found myself just waiting to see Rei again, which is strange since the mashed potatoes I made last week had more personality than she did. Oh, and when Shinji rescued her from her Eva and made her smile, they say my heart grew 10x the normal size that day. I crie everytiem. I'm just kidding.\nNo I'm not. ;(\nTHEME: The theme is pretty consistent up until the end. You really get a feel for what the Anime is going to be about right at the start. Aweome robots fighting huge monsters? Oh yeah, it's that kind of anime. Monster of the week up until the last like, 5 or 10 episodes? I found myself REALLY enjoying the fights, and caring about the characters and city they were protecting. Although the end turned into almost a psychological thriller or something, I don't know how to describe it..\nPACING: Pretty good. Albeit they do throw you in the deep end at the start. And the last 5 to 10 episodes began to drift away. \n\"SHINJI! TIME TO PILOT THIS LIVING MECHA YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND FIGHT A MONSTER HELL-BENT ON DESTROYING OUR EXISTENCE AND THE HUMAN RACE\"\nFather of the year award right here folks. Maybe that's why Shinji is so messed up.. Dammit Dad.. Okay, back to the pacing. \nEven though it's a bit fast at the beginning, I'm not so sure if it's even a bad thing or not. It really sets you up for what the Anime's about, and at first I was thrown off, but began to like it. Monster of the week through most of the episodes and it doesn't feel rushed or too slow for the most part (besides the ending)\nSTORY: What can you say? Awesome half living robots piloted by the hero's of the Anime (if you can call them that) who fight the monsters (Angels) who are trying to destroy the human race. I really liked the Evangelions, especially Shinji's Eva and found myself waiting to see it fight again. It was cool how the Eva's were born from the first Angel and the whole \"second impact\" story was interesting. The whole NERVE part of the story got away from me a little bit and I thought the relationship between Shinji and his dad was kind of, er.. off? The ending was DEPLORABLE. I won't spoil it, probably because I didn't even understand it, or knew what was going on, cliffhanger of the year folks. Ending SUCKS.\nSUMMARY: I liked the characters for the most part. The story was Awesome, and I really loved the fights between the Eva's and the Angel's. Good pacing and decent theme. Giant fighting robots saving the planet? Oh yeah. The ending was awful, although I'm about to watch End of Evangelion, hopefully that will put my mind at ease. I think I'll re-watch the Anime and fast forward to the fighting parts and the scenes with Rei in them, haha just kidding. Kind of. I think this Anime will stick with you, and it's at least worth watching once.\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=56,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    NGE is one of the most popular and influential anime ever made and was also a huge financial success that pulled studio Gainax out of its near bankruptcy situation.\nAnd it most definitely lives up to its name. \nThis is a spoiler free review.\n*Story* 8/10\nThe story is about a teenage boy who's 'forced' (not really) to pilot a giant mech in order to fight off giant creatures and defend an already half destroyed earth. \nThis basic premise is very dated even back when it was made since it was used mainly in super robot shows in the 1970s, but the rest of the story has little\n          \n        to nothing in common with those shows. \nThe story structure is indeed \"monster of the week\", but each episode contains build up, indirect foreshadowing for later plot points , setting exploration and a lot of little details.\nIt is also very complicated. It slowly reveals a conspiracy of sorts from which you get feed bits of information out of context little by little. The story that unfolds involves the truth behind the creatures they're fighting, the mechs they're piloting, the organization they're working for, the history of this post apocalyptic setting and a few other things... The ending (And I'm referring to the movie here) despite being a little vague, is also conclusive, climactic and offers proper closure to the entire cast of characters. \nThe complexity also lies in the amount of themes it involves. It mostly revolves around psychology, philosophy. Some themes are presented through very subtle means and others not so much. It's fairly inconsistent with how it chooses to say things, or you can see it as perfectly balanced, it depends.\nThere's also some religious symbolism, which probably doesn't mean anything, but some of it is there for giving the story a clearer context and not just for decoration purposes. .\nNGE is an interruptive work in some respects, but the theme that is most notable for me (and pretty obvious actually) is a critique of escapism and running away from reality in general. This theme is present pretty much everywhere. The antagonists main objective is clearly a metaphor for escapism. Or the main character sitting in a train or even explicitly saying \"I mustn't run away\" over and over again. \nOk, now that that's over with, the following are the few problems I have with the story that I broke down in to three. These are all valid complaints but they do overlap at times, and I would argue that some also have certain advantages as well;\n*1* It is confusing.\nGranted, it is not easy to follow. For the most part, this is not a good thing since it makes it inaccessible for people who are casuals or just prefer straightforward storytelling. With that being said, you should keep in mind that exposition handled poorly is something that this series did its best to avoid. And it did that quite successfully. Furthermore, this also increases its rewatch value and you discover something new every time you watch it. The answers are there, they're just very blurry or explained very briefly. And yes, there are also some things that aren't explained directly and are mainly just implied (or heavily implied). Which makes it interesting, but it does pay a price for it. \n*2* It has some pacing issues.\nGenerally the pacing is fine and both very eventful and it also has enough breather room. But towards the end it clearly becomes a little rushed and chaotic which also contributes to problem no' 1 and makes things a little more confusing than they should be. So at least make sure to watch the director's cut version that partly fixes this.\n*3* The last 2 episodes add nothing to the story (don't skip them though):\nThis issue also overlaps with the 'Art' section and is fixed by the End of Evangelion movie that puts these episodes in context. These two episodes are character studies that ended in a rushed and not very believable way just for the sake of having a sense of closure in the last episode with its central theme and main character (Omedetou!). They might add something to the characters, but very little to the story, which it halts in between episode 24 and the movie. So the final product is what it is.. Thus, it is a problem story-wise. \nSo overall the story has some obvious issues in its execution, but it is otherwise groundbreaking, rich and extremely well thought out. \n*Characters* 10/10\nThe characters are anti heroes (or unlikely heroes), but not the kind that people like, since they don't commit atrocities for personal gain and look cool while doing it. They're the kind that are relatively grounded in reality in an otherwise dangerous sci fi setting. You know, they have flaws and such.\nThe main character, Shinji is the one who gets the most flak. He is mentally weak and hardly has a backbone as a result of his crappy life (and he's very much aware of what he is). His mother died and his father neglected him, only to call him one day when he needed him to pilot a mech and save the world. This probably goes without saying, but people certainly have higher expectations from fictional characters than they do from real people and since the characters here don't meet those expectations, they receive hatred or ridicule. If Shinji were a real person, he would've been given a lot more credit for his bravery, he's piloting the Eva of own will, nobody's forcing him to. But since he's fictional, it's much easier to just call him names. Even though calling him a coward or whiny is a context-less accusation and even when he runs away, it's for very good reasons. But I digress.\nMost of the characters have psychological issues that you can give to a psychiatrist to analyze. The issues they have are entirely understandable due to their interesting backstories that are eventually revealed (in separate portions, by the way). Their flaws are not only justified, but inevitable considering the traumatizing events they've been through. Even some of the characters that seem normal at first have unresolved issues that are hinted in subtle ways through the most normal looking interactions. Some also behave quite differently depending on who they interact with and who surrounds them. Shinji's mental state in particular plays an important role in the story. Proving how the characters and the direction the story takes are inseparable. \nThey also develop in an unorthodox way through out the series and have ups downs, depending on their circumstances and events that take place.  They're journey is a very rough and rocky road that leads to a cathartic conclusion. And at the same time, none of them have one of those unrealistic 180s that some people seem to be fond of, since that would ruin what makes them feel human. It's mostly about the characters overcoming their weaknesses in a believable way.\nEven the minor characters get a decent enough amount of fleshing out and play certain roles in the story eventually.  But the main cast is actually bigger than the secondary one. So in this case the quantity is in reverse with having a big main cast (all of which develop in some way) and a much smaller supporting cast that you mainly just get to know better. Now that's pretty rare, normally it's the opposite.\nSome of the main cast also popularized certain stereotypes that are very overused by now. Most notably the first cooldere and a (not the first) tsundere. The purpose of their presence is most likely to show us that these stereotypes are mentally ill if such people exist in real life (which also brings us back to criticizing escapism). \nThe only problem I can find with the characters is that towards the end of the series, there was a (*clears throat*) pretty critical moment, and the drama surrounding it seemed a tad overblown as a result of the rushed pacing (overlaps with problem no' 2) it was still powerful though. Also there's Seele who are villains of sorts and they don't have much depth so they do feel like plot devices, but they're certainly a necessary plot device for the central theme of the series so it doesn't really matter.\nAll in all, the characters have plenty of depth, are explored very thoroughly and have a wide range of genuine emotions. They are the backbone of the series. \n*Art* 8/10\nThe mecha designs are unique, creative and iconic. They have an interesting choice of weaponry and their movements are fluid. They even work in a semi realistic way. For example, they have batteries that run out in a matter of 5 minutes if they're not connected to the wall. And each step they take in the city has real damaging repercussions and even the launching process is very detailed. It's not completely realistic of course since it's intended to be a 'super robot', but it looks cool.\nThe Angels look very creepy . Each one has a completely unique design and fights differently so there is a lot of variety in the battles (which are mostly based on strategy).\nEven though they're not always there, the backgrounds are beautifully detailed with nice landscapes and a futuristic Tokyo that looks outstanding.\nBut unfortunately, there's also the infamous unbalanced budget handling on Gainax's part, which makes the animation level feel a little unbalanced. With having the best mech battles ever made in a tv anime in one hand and obvious animation shortcuts on the other. This isn't as bad as people make it out to be since it doesn't happen that often, but it's definitely there. This also led to problem no' 2 and 3 in the story section, so I refer you to those.\nAlso the character designs are a bit generic, but at the same time they're all quite memorable and sexy looking.\nOverall the directing is fantastic and despite its obvious flaws, the visuals have certainly aged better than most from its time and still look quite impressive in some respects.\n*Sound* 10/10\nIt has arguably one of the greatest (and catchiest) openings of all time. It's intense, fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the series and even the lyrics fit. \nThe ending songs are all different versions of Frank Sinatra's 'Fly me to the Moon' so you won't get tired of hearing it. It doesn't always fit the mood or the themes for that matter, but who cares! It's a Frank Sinatra song!! Plus, the some of the lyrics actually fit with a certain spoilerish event near the end.. How convenient!\nThe original soundtrack has many nerve wracking and memorable tunes, as well as very depressing ones. It also contains some classical music that is placed quite well. So that's amazing by default.\nAnd most importantly, the (Japanese) voice acting is excellent and full of bone chilling emotions like crying, screaming and yelling that is quite hard to pull off properly and results in a very memorable performance which sounds very real. Not to mention that Anno is a crazy director and he made his actors repeat takes over and over again until it was perfect (see Asuka's VA interview) and it shows... He even went as far as to change the script, because (according to him) they couldn't deliver their lines properly. \nI can't take away a point.. It sounds fantastic and there's simply nothing wrong with it, unless you count the dub...\n*Enjoyment/Overall* 9/10\nIt's highly recommended to rewatch it by the way. A lot of people change their minds about it the 2nd time around (it's practically been made to be rewatched). I watched it 5 times over the course of 10 years and it only got better every time.\nOverall NGE is a Masterpiece and an all time classic.\nIt is one of a kind and we likely will never see another anime quite like it, despite all the attempts to replicate it. It might be alienating for some, but skipping is out of the question.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=55,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Few anime titles have the power to rile up a heated argument better than Neon Genesis Evangelion. Though successful and hugely influential, this classic of the 90's nevertheless suffers from a slew of problems that cannot be ignored even by the most rabid fanboys out there. However, the hard-to-swallow human drama presented in Eva not only sets it apart from other anime, but depending on the viewer's willingness to analyze the characters, the potential power of Eva's strikingly realistic cast makes for an unforgettable experience that should not be missed out on.\nThe story of Evangelion is twofold: the psychological drama between the characters and the\n          \n        underlying plot pertaining to NERV's conflict against its aggressors. While the former is superb, the latter suffers from a number of glaring flaws that not only makes it inaccessible, but incomplete as well. Though it sets the stage for the various challenges faced by the characters, Anno's cryptic method of relaying the story to the viewers failed to answer a number of key questions that are crucial to the plot: why are the angels attacking Tokyo-3? What exactly are NERV and SEELE's agendas? What is this prophecy that's constantly referred to? Worse yet, there exists a couple of major plot holes that makes it ever harder for the view to take a grasp on the plot. Though one can try to theorize all sorts possibilities with the help of GAINAX's blatant retroactive continuity, it is still a frustrating and unrewarding experience. Like a leaking coffee mug, the plot of Evangelion is a considerable obstacle to the viewer's enjoyment of the contents. \nThat aside, the character drama in Eva is great. Hideki Anno broke established conventions of mecha anime at the time by introducing true-to-life characters into a farfetched sci-fi premise.  The result is something that betrays the expectations of many newcomers: instead of the bold protectors of humanity, the protagonists of Evangelion are a group of conflicted anti-heroes. Throughout the series the three Eva pilots wrestle with their identities as mankind’s only hope, struggle between intimacy and privacy, question their self-worth, and battle the fear that comes with risking their lives in battle, in ways that are feasible for real pre-teens. This means there will be bound to be the immaturity and angst that naturally comes with youth, but this fact really brings the characters to life and pushes them beyond character archetypes. Shinji’s character cannot be summed up quaintly as “the introverted mecha protagonist”, nor is it fair to label Asuka as “generic tsundere”, as the underlying currents that drive the actions of the characters are vivid and complex.  Shinji’s of rough personal journey is very compelling, given that the viewer is able to take notice of his various inner conflicts and insecurities. The deeper one delves into the characters, the more insight and enjoyment it will bring – that is without question the greatest strength of Evangelion.\nThe presentation value of Eva remains great even over a decade later. The character designs are instantly memorable, especially in the main female characters, who have become enduring favorites.  The designs of the angels have a real otherworldly feel to them, though not all of them are very exciting. The mechanical designs are superb. The thin, tall, and sleek look of the Evas is unique, and many of the action scenes look spectacular, especially considering its age and budget. There is an issue of consistency in the art, though, as the size of the Evas fluctuate depending on dramatic effect. Sometimes their size dwarfs the tallest buildings of Tokyo-3, yet at other times they are able to hide within the urban sprawl. Evangelion is also famous for its frequent tendency to cut corners in terms of animation. While the movements of the characters and mecha are well animated, there are a number of scenes where nothing moves onscreen. Be it for the purposes of mood buildup or the peculiarities in the character’s habits, these scenes would have been better with at least some movement, perhaps in the form of mannerisms or minute movements, which can go a long away into conveying the scene. \nThe sounds of Evangelion are also great. The roars of the Evas, the shrieks of the angels, and booms of the explosions serve their roles very well. Shiro Sagisu’s work in the music department is also splendid with a number of great instrumental pieces and battle themes. \nThe last two episodes of Evangelion were the result of the exhaustion of budget and time in Gainax at the time. Hence, they feel far from complete and fail to grant viewers with satisfactory closure. This would heavily blemish the Evangelion experience if not for the film End of Evangelion, which retells the events of the last two episodes from a different perspective. The film, though cryptic in its own right, provides an amazing end to Shinji’s grueling story, and is a definitive achievement in anime filmmaking. Since Neon Genesis Evangelion is incomplete without the End of Evangelion, the film should not be missed by anyone who sat through the 26 episodes, under any circumstances.\nIn the end, Evangelion is something you need to watch, if only because of its titanic influence on Japanese animation, and even Japanese culture, to a degree. That said, not everyone would enjoy it. The plot is needlessly cryptic, the characters may be hard to digest for some viewers, and the grim tone may not be everyone’s cup of tea when it comes to the idea of entertainment. Like a piece of postmodern art, Evangelion may appear daunting and inaccessible. But what lies in the end of the experience is a powerful coming of age story and an allegory to the otaku experience.  A ride full of palpable genuine emotion exuded by the characters, Neon Genesis Evangelion truly lives up to its popularity and success, and should not be missed by anyone.\n        "},

I recieved none of the above.\nStory 2\nI kept watching this anime for and only for the awesomeness of the mecha's. I've heard that if you watch the movies the story for this anime makes more sense... Would you take the chocolate chips out of a cookie, to eat the cookie first and then eat the chips last? No, you would naturally eat the thing as a whole. Back to the anime, there is no explanation, no decisive battle between good\n          \n        and evil, no chocolate chips at all, just a terrible attempt at a psychological battle within a character who has the whiniest, most annoying and difficult to comprehend personalities in any protagonist ever. -EPIC FAILURE- \n\nArt 6\nThe mecha's were amazing for their time, the characters and their piloting outfits all looked sweet. Its too bad the focus of the anime is psychological and not action. There are a lot of good art sequences during the battles but the flashes of random garish colors and etc. that make up psychological segments are absolutely dreadful. About 20 percent of the anime consists of sweet mechaness. 60 percent is decent everyday life art, and the last 20 is the often annoying and senseless art thats suppossed to overwhelm your sense logic. \n\nSound 5\nNothing to get excited over, the sound gets an average score of 6. It would of scored higher except there were far too many alarms, and annoying beeps, even police or ambulance sirens completely randomly and pointless in the middle of the night in a high tech city.\n\nCharacter 7\nThe characters were generally as bad as the rest of the criteria, there were a few saving graces. The main character was too flawed to be anything more then annoying especially during the 2 episode psychological trip. Rei and Misato were definately interesting though, as well as some of the side characters.\n\nEnjoyment 3\nThe battles were the only thing worth watching. Luckily enough for the first half of the anime the battles were frequent. Don't get me wrong the drama could have been okay but the resolution and delivery of it all was an epic failure.\n\nOverall 5\nMost definately a love it or hate it anime. The scores represented here are all over the place as you can see. I tried to evaluate it solely with the criteria in mind but the ending average looks higher to me then i feel it should be. Watching this anime was such a disapointment to me. Ah well.\n        "},

Also, english is not my first language, and I apologize for any mistakes. *\nThis anime starts pretty well. For a few episodes, you might think it will be an epic story about a teenager caught in the unlikely position where he is the only one who can pilot a certain gear (and all the drama that arises from that situation).\nWell, if you thought that, you were wrong.\nA few episodes down the road, you'll notice nothing is moving forward - you don't have a clue about what is going on.\n          \n        That would be OK if it were intended, a move to create anticipation for what is coming next. But no, the main character doesn't have a clue either, and he is too busy (doing nothing at all) to figure things out. He just keeps doing things because, well, that's what he's \"supposed to be doing\".\nDo you know when anime characters desperately \"need a hug\"? You can identify them easily. They stare at the other characters with beady eyes, desperately needing to open their hearts, thinking about things they should say, starting sentences that never get finished... well, turns out ALL the characters in Evangelion are like that. They ALL need a hug. Badly.\n\"Need a hug\" characters often don't communicate, either. They just keep all the important info and questions to themselves. And then you get to roll your eyes over and over again at the ridiculous situations the characters put themselves into. Yes, the \"roll eyes\" factor in Evangelion is high, very high.\nI can't think of anything redeeming to say about this anime. It could have had good characters, but whoever wrote it was too busy making every single character behave like a lunatic. It could have had a good story, but whoever wrote it was too busy raving about metaphysical nonsense. To me, it just feels like whoever wrote this got really depressed halfway through and decided to... I don't know, \"open up\".\nIf you're a sensible kind of person - one who stops to think about what you're watching and one who gets \"touched\" by the characters, who tries to understand what they are thinking and feeling - you'll probably feel like cutting your wrists after watching this.\nMy advice is: stay away.\n        "},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=33,   ["text"]="                          \n    One of the most talked about, loved or hated, admired or despised animes released in the 1990's which we still continuously analysis and study to this day. There are many layers of utter sh*t that hide this anime’s true nature but if you are willing to accompany me, I am sure we can discover all the tactics and mechanisms the writers used to manipulate and brainwash us into considering this pure sh*t a classic. Without further delay, let's review Neon Genesis Evangelion or as I prefer to call it  \"The Life of Hideaki Anno: F*ck the world, F*ck myself and F*ck you, you optimistic\n          \n        fools\".\nThis story revolves around Shinji Ikari / Hideaki Anno as we journey with him as he evolves FROM A miserable, angry emo creep who wants to see all life forms obliterated TO A miserable, angry emo creep who wants to see all life forms obliterated.\nOh.My.God. The fate of humanity's survival is in DANGER!!! What should we do? Should we   a) place it in the hands of a team of well trained and experienced teenagers or  b) place ALL of our faith in a spineless pessimist with no form of training what so ever?   Well, the choice is OBVIOUS!?!\nThe only correct answer is B because.....LOGIC\nOn a more serious note, I consider the weak and cowardly character to be far  more superior to the overly perfect at everything character. I found myself looking forward to Shinji's character when I first began TLOHA. That is until I came to realize that the world \"EVOLVUTION\" to Shinj actually means \"REGRESSION\". Shinji's primary function is to piss the audience off in any way this little sh*t can think of. People tend to hail Shinji as an excellently written character but he just comes off as an exact reflection of the writer himself, someone who's ideals or opinions remain the exact same throughout the show is not REALISM it's the exact opposite.\nNow you'd think that with such an unrelatable protagonist carrying the story, the supporting characters would be much more likeable and varied right? NOPE. The writers magically defy common sense and make ALL the supporting characters INHUMAN. Hell, the f*ckin angels are more relatable.\nWe've got Asuka who's here to raise the awareness for male victims of domestic abuse, Rei who makes sandpaper look like Jesus Christ and a bunch of scientists who have as much importance as Pen Pen......Great Job, you guys *reluctantly claps*\nAll that stuff you heard about robots fighting aliens is nothing but a poorly done facade. In reality, Anno uses this story as a coping mechanism for his ongoing depression. Oh you heard correctly, the creator is in PERFECT CONDITION SO HE WILL DEFINITELY NOT INSERT HIMSELF INTO HIS OWN WRITING.\nThe show's sense of morality is instantly handicapped because of Anno's state of mind at the time. He fails to understand that even the DARKEST stories have a flicker of light in them as do the LIGHTEST stories have a flicker of dark in them. They both go hand in hand and by choosing to ignore one of them it will create a sense of unrealism. Even the darkest animes, Berserk, still manage to include a sense of optimism, while The Life of Hadeaki Anno prefers to rely solely on acts of self hatred which are then used to manipulate the viewer.By doing this, the trust between the writer and the viewer is completely destroyed. Anno dangles thoughts of hope right under the viewer's nose before quickly snatching it back. It is used to get the audience hooked on a sense of hopelessness and despair.\nAnno also likes to make his story near impossible to understand because that will instantly mean it is a masterpiece. This works if it suits the anime it is used in, not because the writer simply wants it to be this way. You will find yourself watching episode after episode in the hopes of uncovering all the answers. When you reach this point in the anime, two things will occur. You will uncover SOME of the answers towards the very end of the show. They will however, end up as a TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. Characters motivations will turn out EXACTLY as they are presented, Angels are just evil etc.\nThe MAJORITY of the answers are instead left up to OUR interpretation. This is were the hundreds of essays trying to understand Evangelion come from. I a quite fond of this method, so I had such high hopes for it. Sigh. The reason this method of writing can't function well in Evangelion is due to Haneaki Anno and no one else. A writer who is heavily biased or opinionated will make the fatal error of inserting their own views into their writing. \nPRO TIP: Unfortunately, all essays on Evangelion are very limited as the writer restricts hope and faith in favour of hatred and depression. This forces all conclusions to be BIASED instead of being IMPARTIAL.\nWhen you take away Eva's overuse of pessimism and complexity, it really is just an average show about teens in robots fighting aliens. Anno still needs one more tactic to grasp our attention. That tactic being: CONTROVERSY.\nThe show is always demonstrating it's MEANINGFULNESS at every chance they can get but this is completely ruined when it swaps this in favour of controversy. While we could have had some form of self growth for Shinji, we are thankfully treated to jaw dropping moments like masturbating over comatose teenagers and awe inspiring pedophilic moments with Misato. Why are these here? To keep people TALKING ABOUT the show no matter how f*cked up it is, they don't care whether you love or hate it.\nCONCLUSION:\nAt the end of the day, NGE is an anime that showcases what an anime will do to become FAMOUS. It ironically betrays what it represents in order to stand out from the crowd. Despite constant arguments, Neon Genesis Evangelion is an anime that never set out to be one of the best animes of all time. Nor did it set out to be one of the worst animes of all time. Neon Genesis Evangelion set out for the sole purpose of being the MOST TALKED ABOUT ANIME OF ALL TIME. And guess what? It worked because we're still talking about it nineteen f*ckin' years later.\n* Although I am quite pompous, this is ultimately MY OPINION. Feel free to share your thoughts and opinions whether they are positive or negative*\n\n\n"},

I tried this because of the reviews it gathered and after watching this I checked out other anime-titles. I couldn't have been more disappointed. No other anime even tried to approach the quality of this series.\nThe series start off simple enough. A boy is 'chosen' to fight big monsters in a robot. However, the monsters seem to be less important than the troubles the people face fighting them.\nAlthough Shinji is no coward by any standard, he's a very troubled person. He hates himself and his father. He needs people around him but they are a constant source of pain. He's\n          \n        a loner, but he doesn't like it much.\nNot a single major character is one-dimensional. Rei is a bit of an enigma, but you could imagine how this very intelligent girl would develop into someone resembling Ritsuko. Asuka is the brass, loud and overconfident girl who's smarter than she appears. Misato seems to be an emotional shut-in but she tries to enjoy life to the fullest. Ritsuko seems perfect at first, an intelligent career woman who's reliable and self-sufficient. And definitely last is Gendo, the commander : cold and focused, dealing with the threat as well as the constant verbal attacks of the Seele-members. Any major character could be analyzed as they grow throughout the series.\nThe first 15 episodes could be considered semi-light fare. Enjoyable and although there are several hints dropped along the way, nothing really gets out of hand too far. The series grow however, and after the 15th episode, the masks are taken off one by one, and it's not a pretty sight.\nBy the end of it all, the series have asked immortal questions like what are we, why are we here and is life worth all the pain that goes with it. For once these questions don't sound trite as the characters have a very good reason for asking.\nDisturbing through the fate and behaviour of it's protagonists, stripping away all illusions about what men are and the horrors we are capable of, the series still manage to retain sympathy for it's characters and a spark of hope for mankind.\nThe series are not perfect. There's some fan-service,corny moments and situations that don't seem logical, especially in the first part of the series. But the many layers and genuine characters more than make up for it. In this case, the endresult outweigh the sum of it's part tremendously.\nThere are 101 reasons why the series have become how they are now. Production problems (time and money), Hidalgo's personal situation, the fans, the critics and so on. You can find socio-economic, theological and psychological analysis of this work. All very well written, interesting and equally valid. Whatever interests you, this series can make you think and hopefully feel.\nI've only given 3 movies a 10. This is one of them. The rating is for the series+the movie. Powerful and unique. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=54,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion (NGE) is the most polarizing anime of all time, no question about it. It's the father of all anime, without NGE where would anime be today? Most likely not existent. Neon Genesis Evangelion premiered in 1995 during a time when anime was in dire straits; Japan's economy crisis was calling for the dispersal of anime. Who saved the dying anime market? Neon Genesis Evangelion. Honestly, if you know what an anime is, then you've heard of Neon Genesis Evangelion at least a couple times in your life. Many say that the anime is the greatest thing ever made, while many others claim\n          \n        that it's so boring, and overrated. Now, which is it? NEITHER. But people that hate NGE are dumbshits, or they are anime haters. You CANNOT hate NGE and love \"anime\". I'm going to cut through the hype behind the anime and provide a rather fair review. Now, I hope you actually read my review instead of just bashing on it. \nNGE was heavily influenced by the creator, Hideaki Anno's depression at the time, which had morphed what was originally intended for young kids into a older teen - adult animation series. NGE is violent, dark, disturbing, confusing, deep and incredibly mature. NGE is a series that every anime fan must see, regardless of your preferred genre. Unless you're some dipwit, the concepts in NGE will influence your life and thoughts about life forever. \nIn the 21st century, humankind faces a threat from giant space creatures known as \"Angels\". In search of survival, the humans form an organization known as \"Nerv\". Nerv builds giant robots called Evangelions to fight off the Angels.\nIn 2015, fifteen years after a global cataclysm known as Second Impact, fourteen-year-old Shinji Ikari (main character) arrives in the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 in response to the summons of his estranged father Gendo Ikari, the director of the special paramilitary force of Nerv. Upon reaching the city, Shinji witnesses the Nerv forces battling an Angel, the large monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold by the Dead Sea Scrolls. Shinji then proceeds to become a pilot of an Evangelion. Along with the battles against the Angels, the main characters struggle to overcome their personal issues and personality conflicts, which factor heavily into the events of the series eventually leading to the ideal conclusion. Throughout the series, many of the main characters constantly have to cope with several social and emotional problems: characters are unwillingly forced to confront socially complex and challenging situations; unresolved sexual tensions grow between numerous characters; injuries, deaths, and defeats cause blows to their psyches; and previously steady relationships begin to falter. Questions begin to arise about what reality is.\nTowards the end of the anime, the characters begin to learn of the true plan of NERV and SEELE, the Human Instrumentality Project. Its purpose is to force the completion of human evolution, and thereby save it from destroying itself. But what does that even mean? \nLike many works of fiction, NGE is an allegory. Most allegories function on only two levels: the story itself and it's symbolic meaning. One of the remarkable things about NGE is that it functions on no less than four distinct levels. It can be enjoyed at face value as an epic sci-fi action adventure, a gradual coming-of-age parable, ingenious dark conceptual lesson, and a treatise on confronting loneliness, scars and uncertainty in the real world. Early episodes contain the true nature of the series, and indeed after viewing the first few installments one wonders what all the fuss is about, as NGE appears to be nothing more than another ho-hum entry into the already overcrowded Boy-Pilots-Giant-Robot genre. But very quickly it becomes apparent that there is much more here than meets the eye, as a global conspiracy of literally Biblical proportions is slowly revealed in tandem with the degeneration of each character's psyche.\nIf there is one thing that Evangelion tells us, it's that life sucks as a whole. The show is cruel and unforgiving, not even hesitating for a second to completely shred all your happy hopes while watching the anime. The brightest spots in the show are \"minorly\" dark and grim. The plot, the characters, the themes, everything is presented in a brutal and sinister light. Evangelion is an anime which defies common stereotypes and conventions to take the viewer on a ride to the depths of the human psyche and the limits of sanity. It is a one way ticket through the psychological disorders and subconscious self loathing deep within the human mind. Confused about what the anime is gonna be like yet? Watch it.\nTo the uninitiated, Evangelion may look like a simple \"We, the Humans Vs Them, the Bad Guys\" mecha anime. But that's not even close to the truth. The story is intricately woven into a very detailed and dubious conspiracy. The whole conspiracy theme is played to maximum effect throughout the anime. \nI will say that a problem with NGE is that it seemed like they \"tried too hard to make the entire anime symbolic and deep\". For example, almost every explosion that happens makes some kind of symbolic shape; and characters spew all these \"deep\" words 24/7 making it seem like they're always talking about deep conceptions when they really aren't. But that's not saying this anime isn't deep, because it really is deep. Also, NGE goes a little bit overboard with the whole \"the world is disgusting and screwed up\" concept. I do agree that our world is repulsive and corrupt in many ways, but this anime just overdoes it. Nothing can possibly be this screwed up in any reality... I certainly think and hope.\nAnother problem with NGE is that there's no character that the viewers can truly love. many of the characters were whiny and useless, such as the main character, Shinji. I knock the characters in NGE because I don't personally like any one of them. BUT from a writing standpoint, all the characters were well thought out, and masterfully written. We can relate with what many of them feel/are questioning in reality; Who are my friends and who are my enemies? Why am I in a situation like this, and why am I doing this? Why me? What is my role in life? What is reality? What is the truth? Is what I'm doing right? \nAnyways, I didn't hate the characters as much as other people did (although characters definitely isn't NGE's strong point). Anno created characters for the Neon Genesis Evangelion series that reflected different parts of his own personality. The characters of Evangelion struggle with their interpersonal relationships, their personal problems, and traumatic events in their past. The deeply human qualities of the characters have enabled some viewers of the show to identify with the characters on a personal level, while others interpret them as historical, religious, or philosophical symbols. The relationships, deceptions that roam all the characters was intriguing to say the least. Just like the plot, the characters also have a fair amount of depth to them. The coming of age, as they were experiencing traumatizing things; all the characters change from the beginning of the anime, to the very end. Something to watch out for indeed. Unfortunately for everyone, Shinji, the main character was way too whiny and pathetic for my liking (but that doesn't mean he's a badly created character). While watching NGE, I had really wanted to bitch-slap Shinji. The other characters were all \"meh\", as well... \nNow, allow me to talk about Shinji a little bit. At the heart of this maelstrom in this deep story (allegory) is Shinji Ikari, the classic Tragic Hero. Imbued with character flaws that ultimately prove his undoing as he spirals into depression and insanity by the series' end, Shinji is a departure from the more idealistic heroes commonplace in mecha anime (or adventure fiction in general, for that matter). Adventure heroes customarily represent the audiences' aspirations: they are people we'd like to be. Shinji, conversely, is representative of the audiences' realizations: his flaws we recognize in ourselves. While he certainly qualifies as an \"adventure hero\" (he single-handedly saves the world no less than 10 times in Evangelion), he has much more in common with the doomed protagonists of Greek Tragedy and Shakespeare than Indiana Jones or Amuro Ray. Abandoned as a young child by his seemingly uncaring father, Shinji believes himself unworthy of love and acceptance, which gives rise to a total lack of trust in himself and in others. The first half of Evangelion sees him build confidence in his own abilities (through piloting the Eva) and develop friendships for the first time with his classmates and coworkers. This is all destroyed in Evangelion's second and third acts, when through an unfortunate series of events Shinji plunges into an even more despondent state than which he began. Ultimately, Shinji is left utterly alone to question the meaning of his existence. It is during Evangelion's final soul-searching episodes that Shinji becomes a mirror on our own selves, and his fear, doubt and loneliness is the fear, doubt and loneliness that exist in us all.\nAnother character that's interesting is the hot-tempered pilot of Eva Unit-02, Asuka Langley Sohryu. At first glance Asuka and Shinji are complete opposites (pure foils): Shinji is passive, quiet, and unassuming, while Asuka is aggressive, outgoing, and seemingly full of confidence. But through the lens of Evangelion's extraordinary character development we learn that deep down Asuka is exactly like Shinji. Fundamental feelings of inadequacy and worthlessness drive Asuka to proclaim herself \"the best\" at whatever she sets out to do, and her fear of abandonment is allayed by convincing herself that \"she doesn't need anybody\". When it becomes apparent that she is in fact not \"the best\" Eva pilot, she begins a mental collapse that parallels Shinji's. Their mental breakdown, and that of the similarly troubled Rei and Misato, is illustrated onscreen in a spectacular manner that redefines the boundaries of animation, taking the medium's potential to portray anything the mind can conceive to a new extreme. An interesting side character to look out for.\nKeep in mind that NGE was made in 1995, therefore the art is obviously not of great quality. Nonetheless, NGE uses their \"old\" art style in perfect use. Although the art isn't beautiful to always stare at, the minor details that went into the backgrounds was nothing short of spectacular. The way each character is portrayed, the detailed mechas (The Angels were quite striking), the dim sinister mood/color surrounding the setting at all times, and most importantly the color symbolism used in the anime. Truly amazing.\nAs for the sound in the anime, the opening was in my opinion rather pretty good, although it may not be of many people's liking. The overall soundtracks were kind of old styled, so it may not be to many people's liking, but it isn't bad at all. Not often do I get to say this but, the dubbing job was very well done. The character's voices all fit their personalities quite well. I've seen both the sub and dub of NGE, and will say that they are both good. The voice actors truly brought out the soul of the characters. \nNow the enjoyable aspect of the anime is tricky. The anime in itself isn't your average action packed enjoyable mecha. It's a psychological deep anime where mechas are just... there. Was it just enjoyable to watch? I guess... But if you want romance and comedy, then this will NOT be the anime for you. But... You should still watch it because this anime is an experience that no one should miss. If you're like me and you like psychological anime that has a deeper concept behind all the action then this is perfect for you. I'd take the word \"enjoyable\" out and replace it with MIND FUCK, which basically sums up NGE. \nI am a psychological, philosophical freak. Therefore, I absolutely loved all the symbolism and themes in the anime. Naming all the symbolism and themes in NGE would result in a 500 page essay, therefore I'll just name a few.\n[THIS IS ALL ABOUT SYMBOLISM SO IF YOU DON'T CARE FOR IT, THEN SKIP]\n- The Evangelion series is permeated with references to Kabbalah, Christianity, Judaism, Shinto, and Gnosticism, complicating viewers' attempts to form an unambiguous interpretation of the series. Of particular influence are the Midrash, the Zohar and other Kabbalistic texts on the Book of Genesis. \n- The connection between the Evas and their pilots, as well as the ultimate goal of the Human Instrumentality Project, bear a strong resemblance to Freud's theories on internal conflict and interpersonal communication.\nCharacter Symbolism: \nRei is a schizophrenic character and she represents the unconscious of Shinji, and Kaworu is Shinji's jungian shadow. Shinji has an Oedipus complex, and is characterized by a libido-destrudo conflict. It has even been suggested that Shinji's entering into Unit-01 is a Freudian \"return to the womb\", and that his struggle to be free of the Eva is his \"rite of passage\" into manhood. In the series there are many references to psychoanalytic concepts, such as the oral stage, introjection, oral personality, ambivalence, and the death drive.\nChristianity Conceptions: \nThe \"Angels\" are a reference to the angels of God from the Old Testament. In 1993, the Evangelion proposal presented the angels, including names and appearances. The most important angels are Adam and Lilith. The first Angel is named Adam, just as the biblical Adam is the first man created by God. The second Angel is named Lilith, a reference to the Jewish folklore in which Lilith is the first wife of Adam. Lilith is shown crucified and impaled with a spear named the \"Lance of Longinus\", the same lance used to pierce the side of Jesus Christ during his crucifixion, according to the Gospel of Nicodemus. Eve or Eva comes from Adam's rib; similarly, the Evangelions come from the Angel first identified as Adam. The goal of the Angels are to return to Adam and create the Third Impact which would destroy mankind, Kaworu Nagisa recognizes humanity as beings of Lilith and identifies them as Lilum. Several times throughout the series, the defeat of an Angel results in a Christian cross shaped explosion.\nUniversial Themes:\nThemes of individuality, consciousness, freedom, choice, and responsibility are heavily relied upon throughout the entire series. \"The sickness unto death\" (episode 16) refers to \"despair,\" and in the introduction of this work, Kierkegaard (philosopher) says that for a Christian, \"Even death itself is not 'the sickness unto death.' Not to mention any of the suffering on Earth known as destitution, illness, misery, privations, misfortune, pain, anguish, grief, or regret. \n[END OF SYMBOLISM]\nThe entire anime is marked by a pervasive darkness that eclipses the already dark television series. Illustrating the real-world events that occurred during the final introspective TV episodes, the action is as savage and uncompromising as the internal struggles that complement it. While Shinji eventually decides that life is something worth living, his return to a barren and ravaged reality reminds us that merely changing your perspective on life will not immediately alter it. Shinji must continue to strive to attain happiness; in reality, happiness doesn't just come to you. \nThe worst thing about Neon Genesis Evangelion is honestly the fanboys of it. They always have to bash other animes, and call NGE the greatest thing to ever happen in human history. If you look at it from an unbiased standpoint and actually understand the anime (which is definitely NOT an easy task), the anime is a genius piece of work, of course with it's flaws. People always criticize the ending for being the worst thing ever, but in honestly it's not. It's just a total mindfuck that 99% of people will NOT understand. I certainly did not until I re-watched it multiple times, and read about it online (heh). Whether you understand it or not, every anime fan must watch Evangelion at least once in their life. But.... For children that are still pure, innocent and do NOT know the horrors of reality, DO NOT WATCH IT. Children will seriously be psychologically damaged if they watch it... Anyways! Truly a deep, classic anime. This is an anime for the ages. Everyone else watch it. I'm going to give it a bit of a break because it's such a classical anime; I'll give it a 10 despite it's flaws.\n\"Mankind's greatest fear is mankind itself.\"\n- Ikari Gendou\n        "},

And for the people out there who believe that those who rate the show low\n          \n        don't get it, you're wrong.  I get it.  I still don't like it.  I feel like I'm being generous giving this a 5.\nI'm not going to say much about the story.  You've got dozens of reviews to tell you about the story that'll give you a basic idea of it.  I give the story a 2 or 3 because it really is trying to be a thoughtful piece that invokes thought.  And it does invoke thought, believe me it does.  But the story is pretty shallow, and could've been done in less than half the episodes without trying to be so artistic.  It is an interesting premise for a show and I really love religious discussions, I just feel like the story was too shallow and too badly done to deserve a good score.\nI won't say much about the art and sound, because they were done pretty well.  The art could've been better, but as I said with the story, it was trying to be \"artistic,\" and kept sending you on these acid trips that were a little underdone in many ways, though they were used too often.  The art and sound wont be impressive by today's standards, but for the time they were done, I think they were pretty impressive.  \nThe characters were really the part of the show that made me quit every single time I tried to watch it.  Shinji is so horribly annoying that he makes my list of least favorite characters in the top 5.  The only character I'm sure I hate more is that guy I keep trying to forget from School Days.  Rei and Asakura I felt were interesting characters for the most part, though by the end it felt like they were almost caricatures of themselves, as really the entire cast is.  I just mention those two because I really liked them at some point in the show.\nI have to say the enjoyment is a one or a two, because any higher would just be a lie.  I didn't enjoy the show, and watched it through twice to make sure I really got it, and wasn't just \"missing the point.\"  Perhaps its as some say, that the biggest problem was the lack of budget.  I can see what people mean by that, but I think the problem lies elsewhere.  The characters were just ridiculous.  The story had serious brain damage that tried and tried to work, but just didn't.  And the biggest problem with me is that I just didn't enjoy it.  By the time I finally finished it I was basically just forcing myself to watch it (and rewatch it) because it's such a big deal to anime enthusiasts, that I felt I had to see it through to the end.\nTo conclude, I would like to say before you crucify me on this, for those people putting this on their favorite list or even as their favorite anime: Find something better.  There are hundreds of anime out there that are so much better than this in every way.  If you want to watch something psychological and thought provoking, go watch Ergo Proxy.  It is both, but it suffers from none of the psychological damage this one does and actually presents itself as a complete product by the end of the show.  The characters aren't all completely self loathing and completely annoying to watch, and like this show, the art is unique and itself part of the story.  Its true that there are not many shows out there that make you think like Evangelion does, but there are a few, and I think pretty much all of them are better than this one.  And if you aren't looking for something thought provoking, there are probably thousands of anime out there that have a decent story, are completely coherent, have more likable characters, and are just so much more well done.\n        "},

Neon Genesis Evangelion happens. Set in future Japan, where science has brought us much forward from where we are now, humans created the evangelions to destroy the Angels; giant creatures from what seems to be extraterrestrials who are out to get us. The main characters are the three pilots of the Evangelions: Shinji Ikari, an always depressed and afraid of being hurt kid, an arrogant brat, Asuka Langeley, and Rei. Also, the head of NERV, a base bent\n          \n        upon destroying the Angels, Shinji’s father, Gendo Ikari, Ritsuko Akagi, the head scientist, and Misato Katsuragi, the chief operations officer.\nThe plot goes on about how these children fight the evangelions and live their lives, and then the plot thickens, as they all struggle from past scars, and overflowing emotions. Which I find cliche. Almost all anime I've seen have this main character who is struggling with past memories, and emotional instability, and generally feels like a nuisance.\nEvangelion is filled with creative ideas of angels (their shapes, their behaviors their natures, their abilities), and how the heroes defeat them, almost like they are major influences for a lot of videogame and anime developers. And the angels here aren't like normal enemies from other anime, they feel real, and hostile, equivalent of bosses in videogames. They won’t ever hold back on killing the evangelions. You’ll get your fair share of action and blood and gore here, along with all the suspension there is. The anime’s themes sometimes change rapidly, but not in an overwhelming manner, in other words, it won’t exhaust your mind trying to comprehend what is happening, but I can assure you that it will surprise you… in a disappointing way sometimes, even. At least that’s what I felt.\nFrom delivering an awesome story, to teaching you high values of life, Evangelion excels in one, and fails miserably at the other. Some episodes here are really strange, and surprising, as to show you how weird the anime can be, but not in a good way, unfortunately, which is a turn off. But you’ll find other moments, where the anime is heading the course it should take, and it can’t get any better. Simply compelling at times.\nOnce you watch the first episode, you won’t stop until you finish the whole anime. A splendid experience, from start to finish….. At least I wish it was from start to finish. There are parts in the anime that seem lacking, and there are parts where the anime is just better without. You’ll encounter a long psychological part, where the minds of the protagonists are being messed up, and most of these parts seem elongated, and are tedious. With that said, the rest is just pure excitement. I’ll say especially at episode 18 and 24 where the anime reaches its climax.\nEvangelion perfected the twisted feel most anime try relentlessly to give, but it failed to show you the beauty of the world. It made me cringe, and by that, I honor it. And I honestly, didn't think it would go this far.\nYou know how a lot of normal movies start out, and continue normally with nothing worth noting, nothing really interesting, and then by the end, it all hits you? Evangelion is the opposite of that. You’ll see later on. Just try not to be disappointed. I know many people who liked the ending, but since a lot of the fans complained about the terrible ending, Gainax made the movie, The End of Evangelion, to replace episodes 25 and 26, which were pretty neat. And wicked.\nYou’ll see a lot of things in other anime which were ripped off from Evangelion, which is very nice to see, and add up to the actual experience.\nIn the end, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a remarkable anime, and one of the best out there. One that should be added to everyone’s anime experiences. You probably should avoid it, if you hated a nagging protagonist, but it wasn't that much annoying to me. 10 hours of pure fun, and 1.5 of not so pure fun.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=53,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most controversial anime in the whole anime history. You will be intrigued by the story and characters as well. Gainax has been known for their works like FLCL, Gurren Lagan, Panty and Stocking and more. If you are intrigued in why people liked and disliked this anime, then give this a try.\nSure, NGE has a interesting plot. Its all about humanity, EVA's, Angels, NERV, religion-themed issue, inner thoughts of 4 Main Characters of this anime and more. Its story is very controversial and when I saw its videos on youtube, it caught my interest to watch this and\n          \n        I'm pretty glad that I watched this anime thats why, the story score for me is 10/10.\nThe Art. This is '90's anime but Gainax did a very well job in handling the art. The EVA's was pretty awesome and baddass. But the Angel's looks kinda let me down, they look like weirds but at least they are already defeated. 9/10\nAbout the Sounds. Personally, the OP song is still in mind, I'm having an LSS of this song and the animation of the Opening Songs is very unique, its very fun to watch the Opening all over again. The Ending Song is refreshing to hear and it had a lot of versions which is very good. The OST was great too, the background music when the action scenes will come out is fitting and hooking too.\nThe voice acting is good. I watched the Japanese Version and I think that all voices fit to the characters though when Asuka speak in German and if you're a German, you know what to say. I also think that Megumi Ogata, Megumi Hayashibara and Akira Ishida did a great job for voicing their characters. Some said that English dub is good too so its up to you what version will you watch. 8/10\nI understand why many people hate Shinji and Asuka. But I tried my best to understand them and its worth it.\nShinji is your weak type of character, had the greatest development through the entire series and a relatable character in my opinion. For his age, you will understand why he runs away, why he hates his father and why he pilots his EVA. He was the main focus in the last 2 episodes so you will understand him very well. Its the first time that I saw a character that don't want to do a stuff. Usually, in a mecha-anime, the MC voluntaries to pilot a robot but here, nope. Its pretty hard to have the responsible to protect the humanity in the age of 14 years old, so Shinji, even though many hates you, I still salute you because of your quote \"I must not run away.\"\nAsuka is a 'b' and annoying character at first, but her backstory made her strong, I admire her for that. She is energetic type of girl but in the same time, she hated everything even herself. But also, I am in the verge of giving her 'my favourite female character' but she lacked developments. I also like her chemistry with Shinji, they are like 'dog and cat'\nRei Ayanami, she had a shocking plot twist but I think she also lacked in development like Asuka. She is very a very interesting character which will want you to know more about her. I still want to know more about her and her relationship with Shinji is good.\nMisato Katsuragi, she and Asuka had similarities. You will find her likeable character but once you learned the truth about her, I wish that you'll not despise her. I think that she and Shinji had this 'mother/sister-son/brother' relationship which I find very fun and heartwarming. She had a lot of developments too throughout the series.\nAs for the other characters, you will have this 'hate-love' feeling for Gendo Ikari, I don't know, I just find him likeable and not-likeable at the same time. The other ones was pretty interesting too. But for me, Kaworu Nagisa is one of the most interesting character. 8/10\nAlthough there are a lot of elements that I did liked and loved about this anime, the ending made me down. Sorry but even if its quite good, there are still some problems that aren't resolved so go watch 'The End of Evangelion' if you hated the ending. And also, Kaworu... I loved his smile, but where's the justice for him?\nBut overall, I really enjoyed NGE and if you are into mecha-animes or psychological animes, give this one a try but I can't assure you if you will regret watching this. But for me, NGE is a one heck of anime.\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=52,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Before I start off, I should inform you that this is a review of both Neon Genesis Evangelion and End of Evangelion, as End of Evangelion serves as an ending to the television series.\nThis show is very special to many people and it is one of the classic animes. After watching it, I understand why. It is extremely unique and engaging, the animation is great, the song-choice and music are phenomenal, the characters are outstanding, and overall it is a very enjoyable experience. However, it is not without its problems. I will quickly highlight some of the positives and negatives as I see them, as\n          \n        to give people who haven't watched this series an idea if it is something they might enjoy.\nFirst, I will start off with something that this show gets incredibly right: the characters. Whether it's Shinji, Asuka, Rei, or one of the other great characters, this show manages to encapsulate them fantastically. Yes, they can be incredibly frustrating, but, strangely enough, that's where some of their charm comes from. To call them likable would be incorrect; they are, however, completely relatable. This show shows mental illness and depression in such an empathetic light, and it shows it amazingly - better than I've ever seen it otherwise portrayed in fiction, in fact. Of course, this is probably because director Hideaki Anno was suffering from clinical depression as he worked on the series. For showing it so well, so honestly, I thank him. The complexity of the characters will sometimes leave you in horror of what they are doing, but that's where much of the shows power comes from.\nUnfortunately this show is not without its potential faults. The plot is very complex, which, in itself, is not a bad thing. (Actually, it's a good thing that it makes its audience think, and it wouldn't be NGE if it didn't.) However, the plot is also convoluted. Many important points are quickly passed over, many characters end up having no real purpose at the end of the show and are almost forgotten by the writers, and plot points are often spoken about as though we, as viewers, already know what's going on, when in fact we have no idea. Often I found my enjoyment of the show impaired by being totally uncertain as to what was going on. Mystery is good, however, total confusion is not. Although, some people may love that about this show, and I know some people do. The positive of this is that the show constantly keeps you on your toes. For my taste it simply went a little bit overboard in that department.\nIf you love to slowly pick apart at a show and gradually figure out what's going on, then this is for you.  Of course, that's only in referencing the plot. These characters are incredibly important the anime and I think any anime fan should give this show a chance. Whether you end up liking it or not, I sincerely believe it will be worth your time. The characters are too unique and interesting to not try it. However, I will leave you with one word of caution: the series does suffer from an inconsistent tone, and the series only truly finds its footing in the second half. If at first you find yourself not enjoying the show, I would recommend continuing. \n        "},

The symbolism is cool but it feel like they are there just to be cool, it don't have a meaning at all, i have nothing to complain about it and at least it contribute with the aesthetic of the show. In other words: the story is not the main focus here.\nArt: 8/10\nHere i have to take apart the design from the animation, the general design is great, the evas are awesome, the non standarzided shapes of angels agrees with the scary and unknown nature of these creatures and everything feels modern and technologic even today, but then we have the animation. It's a shame that it are not as good as the general design, sometimes it's acceptable but it's hard to not notice the budjet control in conversation scenes, the reason of that is well known but a medium viewer don't mind if the procduction team have money to do a descent job or not.\nSound:8/10\nThe soundtrack of this show is good, it don't excels from other aspects of the show but suits fine in the mood, something that i desagree with the most of who watched this series is that the classical music fits well in the scenes where it is present, that scenes are meant to be a little deeper than the standard action scenes and the music plays a big role here.\nCharacters: 9/10\nHere is where the true greatness of this show lies, the characters are very unique and different from the regular kinds we see in the majority of anime, they are very different from each other too and at least the main ones have a plausible background but here is where the main problem lies too, they are so different from the regular anime characters that some people don't like it, Shinji is a coward, Asuka is a bitch, Rei is exprectionless, Misato is a messed up pedo woman and Gendo is an asshole, but let's be honest, people in real life don't act in the maniqueist way that is despicted in most of anime, the good guys are sympathetic and fight in name of justice and friendship while the bad guys only cares about power and don't feel empaty for anyone, NGE completely refuses that logic.\nEnjoyment: 9/10\nThis is a very subjective topic, some of you may enjoy it, some of you may claim it as the greatest piece of art in the history of mankind and some of you may say that it's a complete garbage, this depends on what do you expect from an anime and what kind of people you are, if you have ever experienced mental instability then you may identify yourself with this series, if you are the one who is mentaly stable and have a normal background then you may don't even care with the dillemas on screen, so you have to watch it to known in wich side you are.\nOverall: 10/10\nIt's not a perfect piece of work, some issues can incomodate some people and the metaphysical/symbolic aspect of the show may be debateble, but there's no doubts that it pushed the anime as a storytellig media to a higher level and to some of you who have a more open mind it can be a great an unusual experience.\n        "},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=51,   ["text"]="                          \n    I HATE NEON GENESIS EVANGELION.\nI wish i could scream that at the makers of it, not to mention THE WHOLE FREAKING WORLD.\nOkay. Let's get this over with.\nI really don't want to think about this anime.\nCrud.\nLemme try again.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is, if you couldn't tell from the scores I gave, pathetic. At least to me. The goal of this review/rant is not to convince anyone to hate it, just to show why I hate it. Let's start with the beginning. In the beginning, NGE showed promise. It had a good story, good potential for character growth, and a believable situation, as far as fiction goes. And\n          \n        the main problem i had was the character growth, or lack of it, rather. Shinji Ikari was great raw material for a protagonist, he had his problems, his secrets, his weakness, and his strength, the ability to be an exceptional EVA pilot. And it seemed that he was well on his way to becoming my next favorite character. But do you know where that went? Downhill. The infamous episode 16. He goes into the angel, is trapped, his friends try to save him, he gets out, and immediately begins to go berserk on the very city he is supposed to protect. And I am proud to say that I remember very little of it. I skipped most of that episode, and every episode thereafter. From then on, every episode had a tedious session of him messing with his own head. From then on, angel fights were boring and/or overtly violent. They were obscene bouts of attempted action and they didn't work for me. From then on, Shinji's personality, which had actually seen some positive growth, became completely twisted. You don't get much more twisted than having fantasies about a comatose girl, jerking off to them, then killing her at the end of the alternate ending, which was just as confusing, just as irritating, and just as pointless as the original.\nSpeaking of Asuka, she was another good character that I loved. For a short time. Then she went in the same direction as Shinji, becoming a bathtub inhabiting girl who had \"I hate the world\" issues, just as Shinji had \"The world hates me\" problems. Her tomboyish attitude, her skill with an EVA, her possible love for Shinji- DOWN THE DRAIN. And you might be thinking, \"Now wait, you can't hate the entire anime, as well as the makers of the anime, because the characters didn't develop the way you want, and the story didn't have the ending you wanted.\" I agree, it's not fair to hate an entire anime because of the characters or an unexpected plot. But this is beyond that. Hating a character is proof that the anime is good. It makes you realize that you feel the hate that the characters themselves have. The anime has successfully drawn you in. This is different. An example of an anime making me hate a character by drawing me in is Holland from Eureka Seven. This, on the other hand is me hating the makers of the anime and the anime itself because of what they did to everyone in the story. And an example of an unexpected, unwanted plot turn is the death of Lelouch in Code Geass, or the repeated death of Mayuri in Steins;Gate. This, however, is taking a good anime and killing all purpose, sense, and likability. Seeing Shinji and Asuka kill the angel in episode 9 was very satisfying; seeing Asuka tear apart the angels in The End of Evangelion was not satisfying at all. And it has come to my attention that according to some, Asuka didn't die at the end; these some are liars. Not only does Asuka receive extensive wounds from the fight, she was strangled by Shinji; even if he doesn't actually kill her all the way, he still tried. \nSigh. I really don't want to keep going. But I need to get this out of my system.\nThen there is Rei. Possibly as disappointing a character as Shinji. Out of the three, she has the most potential. But not only do they kill her, they kill her, bring her back, kill her again, reveal that Shinji's dad loves her because she is a clone of his wife, kill all of her other selves, make her appear naked in every episode past 16, and basically spit on my hopes for her. The more I saw her in the beginning, the more screen time I wanted her to have so that she could become a person, a character that might be up there with Yuki Nagato,  Kallen Kozuki, C.C., Lucy from Elfen Lied (not Nyuu, she doesn't really fit), and everyone else who was unapproachable at first but became greatly beloved by all. But, just like Shinji and Asuka, Rei's personality went down the drain. Completely. \nAs for the other characters, they didn't disappoint me nearly as much; Misato was one of my favorites. The only stains on her soul were the extensive sex scenes near the end. Same goes for Ryoji. Toji was a great character in and of himself; too bad he died. Gendo Ikari is one of the non-EVA pilots whom I hate; he is, among other things including a shameless, selfish lunatic, a pedophile. Ritsuko is not as bad as him, but she, as with her mother, are stained and imperfect, which wouldn't be so bad if nearly everyone else wasn't as bad as they were. \nI could go on, but it is getting late, and I really don't feel like going on. Maybe I'll finish up later.\nPeace out. May the blessing of Haruhi Suzumiya be with you always.\n        "},

We've seen it all before [...]\"\n- Mark Schilling; Contemporary Japanese Film 1999.\nWhen talking about Evangelion, it's imperative -and inevitable- to also digress about the people and elements involved with the production of the anime. It's already inserted in the common sense the idea that this series isn't a \"regular\" one, however most people don't know why is it neither what makes it different. \nThat said, the objective here is expose a bit of it, starting with its director/creator. The name: Anno Hideaki.\nHideaki is one of the\n          \n        most notorious and referenced names in post-modern anime, being one of the strongest names into mecha/SciFi series and the precursor in the use of surreal/psychedelic elements as a tool to tell the story in the major anime industry.\nHe became famous undeniably because of Evangelion, but sure had other great works before and after it, being Gunbuster and KareKano wonderful examples. However, besides being personal favorites of mine, for the general masses \"what the hell is KareKano?\". \nThis success with EVA, putting in simple terms, can be explained as a series of factors that (by luck perhaps) came together. First, in 1996 we were living the \"era of the mecha\" so an anime about giant robots was absurdly popular. At the same time it content was a epic about Japanese people fighting to protect the humanity against the forces of evil, an (nationalist) trump card that always works. This mixed with bearable animation, with interesting scenarios and a gorgeous OST was enough to catch a decent audience.\nStill, it wouldn't turn out as the phenomenon EVA is today. What made it grow in audience and in \"importance\" was the perfect symmetric balance between these elements mentioned above and a pretentious -and well played- christian/jewish symbolism, which concealed a metaphorical meaning for the entire story. \nAnno sure did his homework and most of this symbolism is placed and act at perfect continuity and follows the same school of thought during the entire series, but at the same time, by being eccentric it also got the attention of the people who weren't interested -or didn't even get- this symbolism using it as an excuse to push the story to deeper and deeper levels of complexity that anime as an entertainment usually didn't/don't have.\nWe've all seen things fail at this before. It's easy to cite series that tried to bring this complexity to the story and failed to it or didn't succeed at commercial (profitable) areas. EVA did it, and continue to do it throughout the years as we see the re-popularization of it now in 2014 with the \"Rebuild\" series and its conclusion coming up soon.\nOther key factor at this scenario is GAINAX. Perhaps if EVA was produced by any other anime studio we wouldn't see the same results and -I dare to say- it (maybe) wouldn't reach the same levels of popularity.\nIt's well known that GAINAX likes surreal scenarios and eccentric angles/settings in their series. An easy to spot characteristic of their productions is definitely the deconstruction of the linearity of a storyline. It shifts from past to present, with flashbacks and memories introducing new characters and explaining past events thru monologues and -strongly in EVA's case- imagery.\nAnother characteristic of the studio, which also fits Hideaki's style is the extensive use of black screens with huge text. Sometimes part of the dialogue, sometimes just words. \nThe use of this resource at the time when EVA aired can as well be related to the financial issues the studio was going through. Simply, right during the conclusion of the series eps 16 onwards, they were running out of money.\nBut what does it means? It means that they had to cut production value and with that reduce the effects, the rendering and the expenses with intricate battle scenes or editing/coloring and probably the most dangerous part of it, deviate from the original script in order to shrink and compact it.\nThis resulted in longer static scenes, repeated footage and more black screens with text, however -an this is were the \"magic\" exists- due to the series' extensively explored symbology, it didn't feel awkward, it just fit perfectly the whole piece and the mood of those last episodes in a way one could hardly tell the company was bad at their financial sector just by watching it.\nIt's definitely a question without an answer what would be of NGE if it wasn't produced under those specific circumstances.\nThe story is simple and the quote at the beginning of the review explains most of it. The pacing of the beginning of the story is typical of a battle shounen and there's nothing exceptional to it.\nthings will get interesting middle on. \nFirst of all, there are no biblical undertones in this series, those are OVERtones. So if you find something in the series \"similar\" or that \"might\" be a reference to a real object, happening, history, whatever you can bet it is.\nIt's extremely hard to \"review\" this story without getting into the badlands of the spoilers section, so let's just leave pieces of advice.\nAnno wrote Evangelion after recovering from clinical depression, that's why the story has this feeling of self-discovering and self-analysis. Some of the struggles the characters face during the development of the plot are reflections of things he went through himself.\nBesides other things, EVA strongly addresses violence of all kinds and intensities. Mostly shown through symbolism but also graphically. It's not \"inappropriate\" but I personally wouldn't recommend for children or anyone PG-13.\nThe show indeed leads to a psychoanalysis towards the ending. No need to question of you missed something or is watching the wrong sequence of episodes, that's how it works.\nIf the ending isn't satisfying, try the End Of Evangelion (movie, 1997). It's not allegedly a sequel, but could be considered one.\nCharacters are also \"spoilerful\". To be honest, the series itself will review them for you. Every single aspect of them, even more than you'd be interested to know.\nThere are some reasons why people come to NGE's page or get interested in the anime. One, is the already mentioned GIANT FREAKING ROBOTS. Another reason -more hilarious than the first- would be because you encountered an Ikari Shinji MEME, joke or even a \"hate-thread\". Things like \"Get in the f**king robot, Shinji!!\" could be considered anime pop culture.\nShinji is our male protagonist and as will be shown in the very first episode have some issues that will conflict with his \"duty\" that is riding the giant mecha. He ends up as the Christ for all the mocking and jest, but the point of the story is show that every single character have issues, after all, we're all humans but at the same time we can all deal with it and move forward and sometimes... \n-\"Shounen become a legend!\"\nThe third reason why people get interested in this anime, the opening. \nIt's addictive, it's beautiful, the instrumental is wonderful and those first 17 seconds are priceless. Even the harsher critics I've read this far all agreed with one thing about the series: The opening was great. You watch it 26 times and it never gets boring.\nNot only the audio segment but also the animation and editing of it. As the review have been suggesting 'till this far, you might imagine that the OP also holds a symbolism to itself. Well, guess what, it does. It's interesting that you will get it piece by piece as the series progress, just like completing a puzzle. \nShin Seiki Evangelion, literally \"Message/gospel of a new century/age\" translated to 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' basically because it sounds \"cool and complicated\" set a cultural landmark to 90's anime and a new anchor point to many drama and mecha series that would come after it.\nIts references and symbolism requires at least one rewatch for fully comprehension and if one is interested in the franchise should catch up with End Of EVA as well.\nThis is not something everyone will enjoy, but if you're at least curious, it's worth checking it out. Not as a series that will be forever remembered by you, but as an experiment. Likewise, anyone who takes his/hers animu \"seriously\" should have it marked on its list.\n...what a horrible conclusion for a review. \nWell,\nCongratulations!"},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=50,   ["text"]="                          \n    Introduction: \nOn October 25th, 1995, Neon Genesis Evangelion aired its first episode in Japan. By the time the show stopped airing it had won several awards and was lined up for many more, the franchise has since made 2 billion dollars and has set up expectations for, not just mech anime, but all anime in general. So with this lineup of critical praise and high success, it has to be good right? Well today that is what I plan to answer by reviewing this already reviewed to the point of mere pointlessness show. Let’s get on with the review, shall we?\nActual Review:\nThe story of Evangelion\n          \n        begins with are unlikely hero Shinji Ikari, who one day is called to the secret NERV headquarters by his Dad, Gendo, to pilot the super mech Evangelion Unit-01. It has been 15 years since 2nd impact, an event that has destroyed half of Earth’s population and has created the Angels, destructive beings who Shinji is told he must destroy. Along the way we meet up with other pilots Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langely Soryu, also a bunch of other characters, who let’s just say, have a lot of issues…\nSo the story of Evangelion starts out simple enough and, like most mech shows, has a monster of the week set up, however later in the series, it delves into psychological, post modern existentialism territory. Now let me get this out of the way first, the monster of the week episodes are definitely some of the better episodes of the show. Director Hideki Anno was brilliant in finding a way to develop the characters through the battles, and the parts were the strategy team would have to stand back and rethink their plans were well written. Not to say the latter half of the series is bad though, it is very good and most of it is well written and engaging enough for anyone to watch. It also has some very chilling moments and the psychological torment for these characters is well depicted.\nWith this amount of praise I just gave to the story it should be great right? Well there are some things bringing Evangelion down, let’s first start with the characters. So like I said before the characters have a lot of issues, mostly with their psyche, but there’s definitely a barrier between the badly-written characters and the well-written characters. On the well-written side (These are just a few examples) we have Rei Ayanami, Ritsuko Akagi, Misato Katsuragi, and on the badly-side side we have Asuka and Shinji, which is pretty bad since they’re very important characters. You see the main problem with the characters of Evangelion is either their framing or actions. The well-written side is likeable and are correctly framed, the badly-written side has bad framing and do annoying things, making it hard to sympathize with them. \nOn the lower end of the badly-written side we have Asuka because, while she can sometimes be a fun character to watch, she has bad framing! Throughout the whole show she is a self-centered egotistical catalyst for Shinji’s maturing, but near the end of the show when she starts to lose it, we’re then supposed to sympathize with her and be sad she doesn’t feel like she’s the best anymore. This however is made impossible for us because of her actions in the previous episodes. You can’t frame someone in a sympathetic light without first taking a look at their actions and, throughout most of the show, you seeing her being selfish making it hard to sympathize with her. However, Asuka can be forgiven if only because she isn’t outright annoying and honestly this framing didn’t bother me much; she also had an important role in the story.\nShinji Ikari however is not, like Asuka he has an important role in the story he is our main lead, but unlike Asuka its hard for me not to hate him! It’s all because of his actions, throughout the whole story he complains, whines, and runs away from his problems and yet the show asks us to understand his problems and be okay with his annoyance. This could have been accomplished, many unlikeable protagonists have been made from his formula and the thing is, we’re not supposed to like him, he was meant to be an unlikeable protagonist. Shinji’s position however is ruined by his actions, you see the thing is with unlikeable protagonists, they need to grow a backbone every once in a while so you don’t completely hate them, but the only good thing he really ever does is pilot the Eva and in some situations he won’t even do that. However if there is one plus to Shinji’s character it’s that he does have a very understandable reason to be this way and he does want to protect people with Unit-01 at some points, this definitely saves his character at times. Still, it puts a huge damper on the show and brings it down a notch in its greatness. \nHowever nothing compares to the sheer stupidity of the final three episodes of the series were the plot starts to collapse in on itself. You see after building up all this psychological battering and intrigue with the Angels and Rei, the show decides to not focus on this apocalyptic drama, but the characters. Now it had been doing this before, but at least there is still had its feet in what was going on around the characters, in the final three episodes all is lost and creates one of the biggest blackholes in all of anime, Evangelion’s ending.\nMost say it starts with Episode 25, but I say that it’s more accurate to put it at Episode 24 were the writing starts to take a dip. In this episode they introduce Kaworu Nagisa, the fifth child, and in this one episode the show tries to build up a believable connection between Shinji and him, but of course it’s all very rushed because they only have one episode. However at the end of the episode there is still a glimmer of hope for a grand finale, but then the budget ran out, and the final two episodes of literal textbook psychology dribble begins. Not only was the drop in animation apparent to the highest degree, it’s also just boring and extremely disappointing, leaving all the hope for a grand finale against Selee to be destroyed. This is the biggest stopper in Evangelion’s legacy and really ruins the show because, annoying characters aside, the show could have been one of the best shows ever, but the ending just leaves the at a very depressed good…\nNow with that out of the way, we shall take about the shows music. Now the music for the most part isn’t too noticeable, but when you pay attention you will notice some nicely orchestrated pieces in there. For example, in Episode 24, we have some nice music near the end and the main battle theme throughout the series is also very good. There are also some of the eerie tracks, which are a touched overused but usually fit the moments to a tee.\nThen we have the opening and ending’s, the opening most of you probably know from all the Greatest Anime Openings Evar lists floating out there on the internet. It is usually at the top of these lists and, while I don’t know if I agree with this opinion, I will admit the animation and song are very catchy and nice, it still holds up very well today. The ending’s however are less talked about, because it’s just the same animation of a lake with a moon’s reflection and see-through Rei spinning slowly. However the song, Fly me to the Moon (Originally performed by Frank Sinatra), will change to a different remix at certain points in the series. It’s a small touch, but interesting to behold none the less.\nFinally we have the animation, which is definitely the wonkiest part of the show. Throughout most of the show, if you pay attention, shortcuts are used very often and I get the feeling Studio Gainax was actually trying very hard to save the budget. It was a good thing however that they got Director Anno because, if there’s one thing he’s could at, it’s getting angles that uses lighting or distance to make it so the shortcuts are less noticeable and interesting to look at. Despite this the ending and some parts of the show are absolutely terrible and are noticeable, like the scene in Episode 4 were Misato and Shinji literally stand still for a full minute. Strangely enough, this is made up for in the action scenes where we get some of the best animation of the time and everything is in full, beautiful, stunning motion, so really animation is a mixed bag.\nVerdict:\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is a hard show to talk about, like I said in the intro, this show was a very influential one, so I can’t help but recommend it for that and the stellar moments of the show. Yet at the same time, I shouldn’t recommend it for its terrible ending, bad character writing, and some pretty bad animation in spots. In the end, I guess I would recommend it to the hardcore Otaku out there, but if you’re a casual fan you should probably stay away if you’re worried about what I said in the review. \nBefore I go though, I should mention that Neon Genesis Evangelion is licensed and sold by Section 23 Films, there’s also a movie called the End of Evangelion, which was licensed by Manga Entertainment but is out of print. However I would recommend you find a copy, as it is a replacement for the final two episodes of the original series and is better, kind of… Then finally, there’s the Rebuild Movies which is a remake of the series in 4 movies, only two have been released so far and those are licensed by Funimation. If you want to watch them I recommend the original series first before the Rebuilds because, while the rebuild does a lot of things better, the original has more time for character interactions.\n        "},

Now im not going to tell you the huge, detailed world that is evangelion.  However, im am going to tell you why I consider it to be a masterpiece.  \nThis show dares to go places you never even thought you would see in an anime, or anything in that matter.  I kid you not, there are jaw dropping scenes in this anime that will literally blow you away.  Suprise after Suprise after SUPRISE.  You think you know how its going to end, but you\n          \n        really have no idea.\nYes this show is disturbing.  Some scenes in this will most likely make you want to turn away.  The good thing about this show though is that those scenes arent done just to do it, but with a purpose.\nNow i must add that the first 15 episodes are more focused on action and destroying an angel in every episode.  This may seem like your typical anime at first, but after around the 15th episode, things change in a big way.  So stick though it.\nCharacters---- character development is the best your ever going to see in a show. Thats all I got to say about that. \nThe only real downside I can tell someone who is considering watching this show but has no idea about the Evangelion universe is that it can be extremely confusing at times.  Im not embarrased to say that I had to look up wikipedia numerous times to see what exactly was going on in the anime.  \nThats really all I can think of about this anime. Its PERFECT.  Great opening and closing scenes, great animation and detail, great everything.  It made me feel for the characters and what was happening to them.  It made me feel happy one minute and sad the very next.  No anime has ever done that to me.\nPerfect 10/10\nps. dont listen to negative buzz people give about the last 2 episodes.  Give them a chance.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=49,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    I ended up watching the entire series probably about 8 times due to the fact that my brother was a big fan and so was a couple of my friends back in the late 1990's.  At the time this was basically THE anime to watch both in Japan in around the world.  Despite huge fan fare, and a cult following, I didn't seem to like the series as much as other people have.\nStory: 5/10 - Now I know people will blast me about the low rating for the story but the main problem is that the story is pretty simple especially early in\n          \n        the series.  In essence it's robots vs creatures with a twist.  Not much is a surprise,  with only a few plot elements that keeps you wanting to watch more... which other shounen anime like bleach and DBZ does all the time.  The other thing is that later on, the story gradually mixed with amateur psychology, and some of the episodes ended up just purely about the characters' internal struggles with no end in sight.  Japan loves psychology for some reason, and a lot of anime does have it.  Some do it well, others do it horribly, and this anime does it mediocre.  Then there was the last 2 episodes.  Many see it as a work of art.  I see it as a cop-out.  It is something akin to a rambling thought process of a socially withdrawn person.  While it does make sense and I understand why the creators made the last 2 episodes like that it doesn't complete the story and leaves everything hanging.  While the later movies fill the plot holes, I don't think this type of ending is acceptable.  Don't get me wrong, I like endings that purposefully don't tie everything up and leave it to viewer interpretation, but this ending doesn't make you \"think\" it just makes you feel cheated. \nArt: 8/10  For an anime in the late 90's it had crisp animation and I loved the character designs.  Some parts of the animation were choppy and awkward especially in some action sequences but that was expected of animation of over 10 years ago.\nSound: 10/10: I love the music, and the BGM.  It adds a lot of atomosphere to the show, and it can't help but feel excited when you hear the eva launch sequence music, and many of the action music.\nCharacters 6/10:  Overall the characters were interesting.  None of them were particularly deep ie. first impressions tend to be pretty much on the ball for most of the characters.  example: Shinji is withdrawn, shy, timid in the first episode.  Shinji is still withdrawn, shy, timid in episode 22.  Because he doesn't want to hurt others and be hurt by others... a theme that persists for that character for the entire series.  Other characters have the same issue, and the level of development that occurs for all the characters is minimal at best. You learn more about the characters and why they are like that later into the series, but that is not the same as character development. In the case of Asuka, you learn different aspects of her personality, but nothing fundamental changes with her. \nOverall: 6/10  The series overall is enjoyable.  As a mecha series it's one of the better ones out there... but the characters and the story for me was the weak point, that they could have given more polish.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=20,   ["text"]="                          \n    Today I review the winner of my first ever anime review poll, the infamous Neon Genesis Evangelion. Despite your personal feelings toward the series, there are few other anime that garner as much attention or critical debate as Evangelion. A series claimed by many to be one of the most influential in history, Eva touches on a multitude of themes including existentialism, depression, religion and the origin of mankind itself. I’ll do my best to explain my unedited thoughts about the series. And yes, there are spoilers to follow, along with some possibly unpopular opinions. You’ve been warned…\nTo be honest, initially I didn’t know whether\n          \n        I loved or hated the series when it first concluded. Eva invoked emotions of empathy and despair in me no other anime had even come close to doing in the past. The fact that it is possibly the most polarizing anime series of all time has already solidified its place in many viewer’s minds as nothing short of a masterpiece. The concept is intriguing: a deconstruction of the ever-popular mecha genre from the 80’s and 90’s. The mechs look strikingly different from any other series in its time, and the atmosphere is quite palpable throughout the entire anime. Many still scenes without words and carefully arranged animations make the symbolism and emotions of the characters literally come to life. \nAnno really places you in the mind of the pilots, something unprecedented for its time period. Granted, many of the characters were mentally damaged beyond repair, Eva gave a very “real” approach on what a bunch of teenagers piloting giant robots to save humanity would look like. Both Shinji and Asuka are constantly grasping for the appraisal of others, using it as some twisted sense of gratification to offset their lack of relationships with those they want them with the most. Some of the scenes toward the end of the anime involving Asuka are down right depressing, and really hit home if you had any sort of parental issues growing up. Aspects of the series like this help Eva become relatable with its audience, or cause the characters to be so mentally damaged that their level of on relatability is refreshing. \nThe first eight episodes were difficult for me to get through because they seemed so… generic. An Angel would show up, the Evas would either destroy them or Katsuragi would pull off some .0001% chance miracle in the last moment in order to save the day. It seemed just like your standard mech series of old… with randomly interspersed moments of greatness involving elaborate scene construction (Shinji waiting for the train etc.). Around episode ten or so, the mood completely changed, and I felt like the anime was finally beginning. The battles became more intense, the atmosphere was generally less lighthearted and more somber and apathetic. The characters began their fair share of “trials”, and for once I wasn’t sure how each episode would turn out. The pacing was excellent and I found myself bingeing through the last few episodes up to 24.\nThen the ending happened. \nI’m referring to the original, unedited and untampered shitpile of hot-aired nonsense that proved completely unnecessary and out of place. Anno once said that the ending was to illustrate that “to live is to change”. Through the human instrumentality project, various characters in the series were able to synchronize with each other's minds. This allowed them to define their existence or self worth based on the perception of others. In theory this would've been a great way to expand the already intellectual aspects of the show, but the way it was so exclusively slapped on at the end (not to mention the abruptness of episodes 23 and 24) left a very bad taste in my mouth. I understand the studio ran out of money, but they could've come up with something a little more cohesive or relevant to the rest of the series. I've even heard rumors that the bits of dialogue throughout the series mentioning the human instrumentality project were added after the fact, in order to support the stunted ending.  Could you find something inspirational or worthwhile in the ending? Probably. But so could my high school English teacher in literally every line of text Edgar Allen Poe ever wrote. Let the scenes speak for themselves, don't waste time dissecting something so faint it’s almost non-existent.\nEdit: I have also watched End of Evangelion, so feel free to ask me about my thoughts on that movie.\nAnno also mentions in one of his interviews that the characters in Evangelion represent the worst parts of himself. If this is true, he must be one delightful individual to be around (sarcasm intended). Shinji, despite always being down in the dumps, is a rather unique character. Any teenager who’s gone through life with the mentality of always feeling “useless” or “discarded”, is going to be emotionally unstable. But instead of just showing you this side of him, Anno writes Shinji based on his own battles with depression, actually letting you into his mind. It's frustrating and heartbreaking all at the same time. He ends up dodging any labeling as a trope and had me feeling sorry for him by the end of the series. As much as you want to rip through the screen and slap some sense into him, his actions are acceptable for his character. \nAsuka, the possible inception of the anime tsundere, is actually far from it. She turns from an arrogant princess to a shattered soul, as her failures mount and usefulness declines. And although she doesn't quite warm up to Shinji, she lets her guard down and becomes vulnerable toward the end. Another miraculous piece of character development was Katsuragi.  She initially started is my least favorite character, acting more bombastic and impulsive than any female I've ever encountered, often using unfounded intuition to counter logic on a supervisory level. I found her interest in warming up to Shinji puzzling, and her actions could be classified as bipolar. Then, once her flaws and past were slowly unraveled she became one of the most complex and fragile characters I can remember. Rei, the worst character in the series, essentially enhanced the stereotype she was created to break. Anno attempted to add developing emotions for her doll-like archetype, but ended up do more harm than good. She was uninteresting in all facets, drawing you in only to lead you into dead ends regarding her personality. Even the side characters were developed appropriately, each with their own goals, desires and fears, furthering my affinity for the writing of the characters.\nAs good as the writing was for the concepts and characters, Anno left a lot of unanswered questions on the table in Eva. Where did the angels come from? Who is Adam? What is Lillith? What “freak accident” killed Shinji’s mom? What makes children the ones who sync with the Evas? Why was Kaji obsessed with farming watermelons? All of these (sans the melons) were rather important pieces missing from the puzzle at the conclusion of the series. If Anno’s goal was to leave everything so open ended, he certainly succeeded in creating some lively debate amongst us in the anime community. Call me simple-minded, but I am an engineer by trade… I have a very logical brain. I just don't buy the cop-out reason Anno gave for Eva’s ambiguity: “the answers are whatever the viewer wants them to be.” That's gotta be the crunchiest excuse I've heard regarding loose ends in a plot.\nThe moments of religious symbolism also rubbed me in the wrong way as it ignorantly seemed to mock Christianity as a whole. I’m not a religious nut, but if you’re going to use links to it in symbolic ways, at least do your homework. A creative designer for Eva even said that the basis for many of the symbols used for religious intent were just kind of “put” there. None of the team were Christians or really understood the religion. It was sort of just sprinkled in there.\nThe art and animation in Evangelion is on a whole different level for a 90’s anime. It’s really obvious that Gainax went past their budget with this one. The Eva designs look life-like and visceral, and the angels themselves are all uniquely designed. Their organic, yet robotic composition was haunting and many of the designs were creative in both appearance and functionality. The environments were vividly constructed and the level of detail was uncanny at times, with many scenes incorporating copious amounts of symbolism or hidden messages. Sometimes they could be a stretch for me though, including the moments of awkward silence on the elevator with Rei and Asuka, or the one with Shinji in the Eva near the end of the series. Silence is great, and can help you emphasize certain emotions within the scene… but moderation is key here. \nThe music is also quite iconic for its time. “Cruel Angel’s Thesis” is possibly one of the most recognizable anime openings ever and “Fly Me to the Moon” is just as notable as an ED. The fanfare-ish music during battles is well orchestrated to set the mood, and the voice acting in both Japanese and English is among some of the best in the business. Shinji’s screams alone are powerful enough to stay with you long after the series concludes.\nThe best way I can sum up Eva in one sentence is “An intellectual and pondering deconstruction leaving no hope on the table and many unanswered questions and lively debates.” Watching Eva is an absolute must for ANY anime fan based on just having an opinion, if for nothing else. I enjoyed it but was frustrated at the same time due to the plethora of loose ends and unfulfilling ending. I can't call it a masterpiece but it was still highly entertaining. The best part of a series like Eva is the vast difference in opinion it spawns. There's no denying the importance the anime has in influence around the industry, and I laid my opinions out there and had a lot of fun with this anime review polling experience. Thanks for reading!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=48,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This is the anime that started my fascination with anime.  In the beginning of the series it fulfilled my thirst for action when i was a kid.  But after watching it years later, i realized that Evangelion was so much more than giant robots fighting each other.  Every character in this series could have been picked directly out of the real world.  Every single character is deeply, emotionally flawed, but entirely believable.  While some people may complain that characters are whiny or annoying, they are real.  The characters aren't some all powerful person who was chosen to save the\n          \n        world, they are normal*(they have some extreme issues, but they are normal).  The art style of the nineties is definitely showing it's age, but I have seen worse.  What is done with what they have is amazing.  They use every scene to symbolize something vital to the story, and if you aren't paying attention, you may not understand the big finale.  The sounds of this movie still give me chills just thinking about them.   The sound of the cicadas screeching in the air as everything goes to hell around them sort of symbolizes the whole story.  There is only one flaw to Evangelion that i see for new audiences, you may have to watch it twice.  There is so much symbolism and other events going on in this series that it's impossible to understand everything in the first run through.  But if you have the time, i recommend this 100%.  Before with the final two episodes, i would suggest watching the movie End Of Evangelion in order to fully understand what is happening in Tokyo 3.  I have read alot of manga and have seen alot of anime, but nothing has compared to the quality, beauty, and scale of Eva.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=48,   ["text"]="                          \n    This is about the evangelion TV series. The original TV run of 26 episodes without any special editions, recuts, director's cuts, alternate reality endings, more funding endings, better endings, re-envisioned script TV movies.\nThis is about Hideaki Anno's mindfuck acid trip that people seem to call an excellent anime, despite it being a mishmash of bad ideas, terrible plot, and has been redone more than Lucas's Star Wars franchise.\nAt the heart of this is Shinji. A loathsome coward of a man who is perhaps the biggest pussy in anime--he has zero redeeming character traits and when he starts to build up some, he pisses it away\n          \n        and make us wish we could strangle him. He is not an identifiable character, we're supposed to hate him, I guess. Shinji gets conscripted by Shotacon Misato (if she were to fuck Rei, Shinji, and Asuka while they were in her apartment, at least the anime would be more plausible) to pilot his daddy's giant robot/mutant thing. This is because post-apocalyptic (taking a creative view of Revelations) Japan has been attacked by angels.\nThat's right. The end of the world isn't some place in Israel, but Japan. And Shinji needs to pilot the bioweapon Evangelion (called Neon because they come in cool 1990s neon paint schemes and hammer pants) against the \"angels\" who are waging all sorts of physical, psychological, and biological warfare against humanity because Gendo (Shinji's dad) has stocked something away from them in his NERV complex under Tokyo and is using kids with their neon robots to protect.\nThe plot doesn't make sense. Although the show retcons meaning into the last episodes, there's NO FUCKING WAY they knew what was going on when they started to make it, and it seems like when they finally settled on a plot, they ran with it, neglecting the plot holes they made.\nThe characters are loathsome as well. Gendo is just a dick. He hates his son, sacrificed his wife, has no sympathy for anything or anyone (as is told by a sidestory how he screws around with the women he works with). Asuka is just a screwed up girl. Self loathing, tortured, unstable, and has a daddy's complex for her handler Kaji (so he's a lolicon). She has all the charm of a molested girl turned stripper.\nRei, the bloody and beaten \"heroine\" is as much of an albino in her personality as her appearance. Bland, creepy, emotionless. Dying all the time, but what do we care about someone with no personality. \nMisato, as described before, is a whore--shamelessly parading her sexuality before Shinji, using it as leverage at NERV and essentially selling herself out. Eerily it's not done in the typical amusing anime fashion, but a creepy pathological criminal fashion as to someone who has no other way to express her feelings of fear and love which also destroys any sympathy she may have had. And then there's Ritsuko. Mommy's girl. She's essentially a blonde Misato who hates the kids more than Gendo does.\nThe music is a cacophony of orchestrations that sound like lion seals being raped to the banging of drums. The Evangelions are actually clever mecha designs, and their appearance is intentionally primeaval and terrifying. The animation quality is decent for the time.\nWhat kills Evangelion is the premise that we're supposed to know what's going on (whether through retconning of the plot or just loose associations with Kaballah--pure shit--and Revelations). Except that the writers never did their homework. Add to that the two finale episodes which seem like the production staff ran out of money, Anno had a nervous breakdown, and everyone got shitfaced drunk with a box of crayons and decided to put a shovel in the head of this trainwreck of an anime. The decision to do so spawning more reimaginings, movies, and alternate reality endings...\nSave yourself the headache of a show that has no idea where it's going for the first 13 or so episodes, has head trip characters you want to take out back and shoot, and an ending that will leave you exasperated.\nI can't understand the appeal of this franchise. \nOR WHY IT REFUSES TO DIE.\nBut odds are you've seen Evangelion already, anyway. Because everyone has seen it. And we're all worse off for it.\nIf you haven't, see RahXephon. It's Evangelion lite. And the characters are more endearing.\n...\nPS: I also have an alternate theory. That Evangelion is REALLY about what kind of asshole people stay behind in the world after the Rapture takes all the good people to Heaven.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=42,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    This anime is considered one of the most classic anime of all time. And unlike most of today's ''classic''  this anime has all the right materials to actually  considered as one. But there is a huge gap between ''classic'' and ''masterpiece''. And while Neon Genesis Evangelion (for short NGE) IS classic at least for me was (NOT) a masterpiece. But let's take things from the beginning. NGE has a rather simple storyline with a post-apocalyptic setting where mankind is fighting against giant aliens that are threatening them with extinction. This is all right and well but there was a big problem. The first\n          \n        14 episodes where boring and not boring because nothing happens but because we are seeing the same thing over and over again. The main characters are fighting the angels, defeat them and the we have a little bit of their daily lives along with a little bit of slapstick comedy. I know that this episodes were necessary for the other half of this anime as it was building the character development but still I believe it could handle it better. But the second half... well this is were things start to get really dark. The plot suddenly becomes so depressing and interesting that I forgot all the previous boring episodes. And the conclusion which comes with the three last episodes will leave you speechless. The art was good especially for the time that it was made but still I believe it was overrated a bit because of the repetitive scenes that we are  seeing in a lot of episodes. Still, I have to give extra credit for the stunning job that the animators made for the last two episodes. For the sound I have to say that the results were amazing. The opening of NGE is considered one of the most classic songs of all time and I will have to agree with that. But for me the most amazing was the ending which was ''Fly me to the moon'' with different instrumental and singing versions in every episode. The voice actors should be given as an example of perfect acting. Megumi Ogata was perfect as Shinji, Megumi Hayashibara stunning as the quiet Ayanami Rei, Akira IShida AMAZING as the enigmatic Kaoru and generally all of the voice actors give an excellent performance to all of their characters. Now let's talk about the characters. This anime is completely built on character development. Really all of it's characters are so humans. All of them have their inner demons and all of them are hiding something. This is the real virtue of this anime. It's excellent characters each of them unique in their own way make this anime worth watching. Only bad thing was that I had to wait a number of episodes until I finally sawthis amazing development. Lastly, I have to say that Evangelion was not flawless. It had a lot of things that kept it from being a  masterpiece. But it's certainly different from almost any other anime that you have ever seen. And I believe this makes it worth watching it. \nSorry for my bad English I know I've made a lot of mistakes. Hope I helped you. Feedback and opinions will be gladly accepted ;)\n        "},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=47,   ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion is probably the worst anime I have ever had the misfortune of seeing. I will be looking at the story, characters, and art/animation of this shitfest and telling you why you shouldn't watch it. \nStory\nThe story starts off interesting enough, a young boy has to pilot a giant robot to save humanity. Obviously not anything very creative or groundbreaking, but it's a plot. About halfway through the show, it starts to go into the more psychological aspects of the characters and focuses less on the super epic robot and angel fights. At this point the viewer usually starts to question whether or\n          \n        not they should even continue watching this stupid anime about people talking about their feelings and shit, as the epic fights become more and more scarce throughout the show. Then we have the last two episodes, probably the biggest shit that anyone has ever taken while creating an anime, as if to mock the viewer for sticking with this show to the end. None of the viewers' questions are answered, and nothing even gets resolved.\nCharacters\nThis is where this anime really shits the bed. Let's start with the main character Shinji Ikari, aka the whiniest little bitch in all of anime history. This kid gets his own giant robot to pilot to fight off evil and save the world from destruction, and all he does the entire anime is bitch and moan about piloting the robot, and runs away. Shinji is probably the worst main character ever created, and could learn a thing or two from an actual main character that knows hardship, and faces his fears, like Tatsumi from Akame ga Kill. Next let's talk about Misato. There isn't much to say about her, she is a pretty one dimensional character, and her only real purpose is fanservice. Next is Asuka, your typical tsundere archetype character whose only memorable line in the entire anime is \"Anta baka\". As annoying and generic as Asuka is, she would have made a much better main protagonist than Shinji. The rest of the cast is either not interesting enough to mention, or easily forgettable, so let's move on to the animation.\nArt/Animation\nThe only thing to really say about this is that it is an anime from the '90s, and it ran out of budget before it was even finished. This combination attributed to the already low tier art and animation, being further dragged down by (on multiple occasions) the director resorting to using a still frame for entire minutes at a time. This is also why the last two episodes were the trainwreck that they were, because they didn't have enough money to actually use decent animation. I would say that the animation is the worst part of this anime, but I would be lying, because as bad as the animation was, the characters were probably still worse.\nOverall, this was a horrible anime with unlikable, whiny characters, and a plot that started off good with awesome robot battles until it abandoned the epic fights for a more seemingly random transition to a psychological anime. My final verdict: this anime is nowhere near as good as anime that is coming out nowadays, and you should avoid watching this anime at all costs.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=47,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This review is not entirely spoiler free, as I find it quite difficult to write about Neon Genesis Evangelion without any spoilers. So yeah, save yourselves.\nLet's begin.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion: the legendary mother of mecha genre, and probably one of the most discussed animes of all time. This anime divides opinions quite harshly; you either love it, or despise it with your whole heart. Neon Genesis Evangelion is not for everybody - yet I do recommend it for everyone, just so that you can form your own opinion of it. For me, Neon Genesis Evangelion was a solid 10, even though my theories of the whole\n          \n        series vary from extremely deep explanations, to utter confusion, as in: \"I have no fucking idea what this whole anime was about\".\nSo, what is so great about this anime? \nLet's start with the plot; Neon Genesis Evangelion (or NGE shortly) tells the (confusing) story of 14-year-old Ikari Shinji, commonly known as \"spineless coward\" in reviews and on forums. Shinji Ikari fights with daddy issues, like every self-respecting anime protagonist does. In addition to having to fight with daddy issues, Shinji is chosen to pilot a massive-robot-like-mecha-humanoid-thing called EVA. Along with other 14-year-old kids, he fights against monsters that are ironically called 'Angels'.\nEvangelion's plot isn't unique, we've seen all of this before: monsters fighting other monsters is nothing new. In the beginning of the anime, the story seems very simple and most of the episodes follow the same routine - characters interacting, monster (/angel) appears, there's a problem, the monster's destroyed. Only at the end of the series things are starting to get serious. \nHow the anime progresses, is what makes it so outstanding. The story progresses gradually, never actually giving you the whole story. Some of the questions are left unanswered, giving the viewer a chance to form their own theories and opinions based on the anime. Especially the ending leaves the viewer a lot of space to think. I've heard somebody say that 'everybody sees the story of Evangelion differently', and I think that is quite true.\nOne of the reasons why I liked this anime so much, was its characters. They appear very human-like, realistic, and you can easily identify yourself with them. Every single character has their own vulnerabilities, and as the story progresses, their backstories are revealed. Evangelion's characters have a lot of depth in them. During the last two episodes, we even get to see what's going on inside their minds, as the story switches from the outer world to inside of the minds of the main characters. \nNeon Genesis Evangelion had many good characters, but the ones that stood out to me the most were Shinji's cold father Ikari Gendo, the egotistical Asuka Langley Soryu and Nagisa Kaworu. I especially liked Nagisa Kaworu, who seemed to have a great impact on Shinji, even though he only appeared in one episode. In a matter of minutes, he helped Shinji change from an insecure 'emo kid' to a blushing, smiling boy. I would've loved to see more of these together, but... yeah. \nThe art style of NGE is really good, considering the fact that it's almost 20 years old. The designs of the EVAs are really well made, as are the character designs. The battle scenes are also nice to watch. Everything about the art is good if you just don't mind the usage of the stills, especially at the end of the series. This however, is understandable when you take in consideration the fact that they were having difficulties with budget. The lack of budget really shows in the last episodes of the series, yet they've tried hiding it with really creative ways. \nI don't have anything bad to say about the sound, neither. I'd just like to give an honorable mention to the opening song, \"Cruel Angel's Thesis\" (/Zankokuna Tenshi no These) by Takahashi Yoko. This is by far one of my favorite opening songs in the whole anime history. A great song you'll never grow tired of (...that might be just me though).\nAll in all, Neon Genesis Evangelion is an anime worth watching. Hate it or love it, you can't deny the fact that it is one of the most legendary animes that shaped what the anime industry is nowadays. Watching Neon Genesis Evangelion is an adventure you shouldn't miss."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=47,   ["text"]="                          \n    I'm not going to structure this review as is custom here, since I'm sure many people have done that already with an anime like NGE. I'm simply going to say what I felt about the show.\nI watched this show when I was in middle school and I loved it from the first time I saw it, I actually still watch it from time to time. \nWhat makes NGE such a good anime for me is that it destroyed the mainstream attributes of mecha anime. The protagonist is not heroic, brave or cool but rather he is a colossal coward. His fellow pilot, Ayanami Rei feels\n          \n        almost lifeless as she hardly talks and even when she does you can hardly hear her. The third pilot, Asuka, is just a cocky brat who lives off own her ego, but perhaps the most dynamic out of them all. None of them have any trait that is admirable, but that is why I like the show, because it shows mankind for who he is: the imperfect, greedy and a selfish creature that would sacrifice everything at his disposal to achieve its goal.\nThe nerve synchronization theory to pilot the EVA's provides a more understandable explanation than most other mecha anime which almost always uses 2 joysticks. The action scenes are quite gory and brutal (maybe even badass) and it left me with a rather... dirty feeling after every battle. It emphasizes the emptiness of the battles they fight and actually makes the task of protecting mankind look somewhat evil. I also liked this because it was so different from what I expected, different from other series which tries to put hope in mankind and his good nature through those dramatic battles etc. I mean, it was really refreshing to see NGE do this. (ironically enough)\nThe psychological instability of the pilots are quite severe and is explored in detail in the series, which is understandable given that the pilots are kids who experience the pain of a limb being ripped off or getting a hole in their head as they fight the angels.\nI mean, if one had to go through all that every time they fight with the chances of success of about 1%, I wonder how many of us would remain sane or willing to go on fighting.\nThus most of the episodes are dominated by a somewhat peaceful but despairing atmosphere. Together with all the depth and symbolism in the plot, the conspiracies, religious references and the hints of hidden motives of individual characters, it creates one of the most accurate depictions of mankind and this world. It represents the ugly side of man and displays a future that fits that image.\nWeirdly enough, that was what was made this show enjoyable to me. But that is not to say that other elements such as depth, symbolism etc mentioned earlier does not deserve equal attention and study. I'm sure there are tons of reviews commenting on those so fill yourself in there for more.\nIn conclusion I loved this anime and although it is highly controversial, it is a classic and a must-watch for any anime fan.\n        "},

Just for plot, enjoyment, sake etc. There are few flaws, excepcionally that there is no time to do everything that should be need.\nArt 8/10\nIn 1995 it could be better, but it is really good at all.

However, it seems that it's because the short time of show.\nEnjoyment 9/10\nFirst of all, the first cour is not very interesting if you don't pay much attention. It's like a below average mecha anime. But it isn't. Since you can pass the beggining, you would enjoy this! However it fails in last 2 episodes. I understood a little what is occuring when I was seeing, but it could be boring or annoying for many people, but don't give up. There are a sequel on the movie \"Death & Rebirth\" and \"The End of Evangelion\". Also the \"alternative setting\" with the \"Evangelion 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0\". The fourth Rebuild would come at Winter 2015, and it's called by 3.0+1.0.\nOverall 9/10\nWhen someone talk about psychedelic, the first thing that comes to my mind is \"Evangelion\". In a time when most studios bother to animate \"shounens\" of beating, nosense mecha, comedies and worst novels \"Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-Chan\" and \"Twilight Saga,\" Anno Hideaki came to revolutionize the anime industry and entertainment in general, becoming a worldwide reference and transforming the world of anime into something more serious. I cannot overlook the classics movies from Ghibli that came out before \"Evangelion\" (1995) and a few other good anime, but they are exceptions and did not directly impact because it attacked the industry's clichés in general.\nThat's why I believe that this franchise is one of the main criticisms in the world's media format. Not only the visual entertainment industry, but also the whole global governments \"circensis\", feeding old traditions and conventions, such as religious affiliations (haha ... The angels are not the \"bad guys\" for nothing. I could talk a lot about them), prejudice, outdated stories in the history books and deconstructing the world itself created by Hideaki, demonstrating that nothing is what it seems. Who is the villain and who is the hero? Duty is the only thing that matters? What we really are?\nEvangelion also shows us that we ourselves create our world, however, the more fled the Collective Reality, worse we stayed. The environment will \"give failure.\" There is a discussion of the balance throughout the series. While we are a destabilizing factor to the environment because we are living beings, we depend on a level of homeostasis with the environment and with our fellow men. But just balance with the environment generates passivity, inactivity, or can even call DEATH.\nWell, this is just a summary of what I see in \"Evangelion\": a deconstruction of our reality and a critique of the entire current thinking model. I just think a shame that most people have not noticed his message. But in a way, Hideaki probably not intended the general public, only those who were able to understand. I understand his position because, really, not all able to \"save\", as far as we can corcern. I can even get this hint and say that Monogatari Series would be inspired in this regard: the message is not for everyone. The world is not for everyone. No one can be saved except through yourself.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=46,   ["text"]="                          \n    It’s only once in a blue moon when you write a review about an anime that felt so mediocre with how  have been standards charting so high in present times, but I have to at least give credit that the show is almost 17 years old already, and it was ridiculously low budgeted during those times. There is a single aspect about the show that I’ll have to tackle before I start the review, the fact that I have absolutely no idea how to put it in good terms with the type of standards that we have for current generation shows.\nBut just in case,\n          \n        people should know that people shouldn’t compare a show to other shows (unless it’s just begging to be compared due to the utter shocking display of similarity in themes, sequencing and/or character design), the problem at hand is that standards change over time. If you dare say that you use the standards of today to criticize Neon Genies Evangelion (NGE for short from now on), it would end up a mediocre ‘meh’ to the tickle bone, which would be wrong to describe the show over-all, but if you criticize it in standards that go back to the 90’s, it would be like a relaxing hand-rub to the privates where masturbating hasn’t been invented yet, which is also wrong if you want to describe NGE in its over-all aspect. \nSo generally speaking, reviewing NGE is going to be different in its aspect because you cannot review it in the conventional sense without it feeling lacking. So I have decided to review it using standardization from both the present time and during the 90’s. It will get confusing from this point onwards, but I would like you to bear with it for the sake of properly understanding that it’s glamorous and at the same time, it’s bland.\nTo start off, NGE’s overall story is basically a generic foretelling of any other anime that has existed as time tells, but what separates NGE from the other mecha shows out there is the how the characters in in the anime was individually portrayed. The show basically revolves around the protagonist who dislikes becoming a pilot of a giant robot, but was forced by everyone for the sake of the survival of the human race, even if he’s against the idea piloting and/or surviving. The theme depicts also of that of a generic mecha anime as well (being that the protagonist fight giant aliens inside a similarly sized robot), but what makes it stand out from the rest is its other theme (which is basically the psychological part of the story).\nWith that said, the main problem concerning NGE is its extremely slow paced start when the show begins. It starts off so boring and the boredom doesn’t disappear completely until you reach the part where almost all of the characters are properly introduced, which takes more than half of the whole show sadly. The progression during the first half of the entire show is just so slow, that it’s just not even comparable of that of a sloth, turtle, or a snail, it is Internet Explorer slow. But even so, it at least did try to give us a small portion of character development and some, slightly off, battle scenes that are not as satisfying for the usual mecha standardization chart (but then again, it’s not the usual mecha anime that everybody thinks it should be).\nWith that said, it at least gave a big impression in the lesser half of the overall show span because the good parts are starting to piece out, pop out, and is starting to shine bright like in that similar song where a precious gleaming gem was commonly pronounced in an annoying tone (what was that, diamonds? I have no idea what you’re talking about). It’s the point of the show where almost all the significant characters were given the most interesting background check and character build-up (in a gaming sense, buffs), but I’m still going to point out that the all the exciting tidbits in the story only showed up during after the half of the whole show which, in my opinion, is still sad to begin with. If you’re probably the type of person that drops shows if it doesn’t get interesting very quickly, you’ll probably drop this faster than a certain comical shady trio speeding in the speed of light and go for a quick surrender without even giving a fight, Meowth that’s right!\nBut if you did manage to get to the good part of the whole anime, it still depends on your opinion on whether it was really all worth it or not because it’s still questionable to your taste if it was or wasn't delicious. Just to share some things, being in the field of psychology myself, I find the psychological parts of the show just utterly shallow. It’s mostly about teenagers having extreme amount of anxiety, parental issues, identity crisis, and just general insecurity over themselves. Basically, what every teenager face in their so called ‘emo stage’ but only a lot worse than the normal. All of those things could have been easily prevented if they went into some sort of self-help program, which is weird because (POTENTAIL SPOILER WARNING!) the last two episodes was like being in a psychological help center for troubled teenagers (END OF POTENTIAL SPOILER), which was a big facepalm for me because I felt that all these retarded issues could have been managed beforehand during the early-mid of the show but they only did it when the show was about to end (but then again, who am I to dictate how the devs want the anime to go).\nThere was also the issue where the show went too fast paced in the near end of the whole anime.  The devs tried to patched up so much holes near the end that they ended up either missing some holes, or the holes that they tried to patch-up was too big for a brief explanation, leaving people needing a rewatch or two just to fully understand the story (given that the fact that the likelihood of wanting to replay the whole thing is equal or lower than 20% unless you’re a fan-boy of the series, the fan-service and/or moe, or the mecha/psychological genre). But with that been said, I’m continuing to the fact that the good parts of the show was too fast paced. It went so fast that I barely had time to absorb anything that’s happening during the near end without having to pause the damn thing every time they talk, and even with the pausing, it’s still a vague explanation of events overall (that or maybe I just don’t understand sci-fi science, or so help me). \nI’m just gonna go through the overall art style quickly because there was nothing special in the art style used in NGE. It was your typical 90’s anime style, with shaky outlines, and dusty feeling of oldness that you can only see when you watch other shows made in the 90’s, like that one show where this guy got an X in his face. But I have to admit that they went through some intense work designing the mechas and the, minimalistic yet well polished, antagonists. Character design in NGE was the usual 90’s character design yet very daring as well. I mean, I have no issue with the male and female character design because it was the typical people design that was being used during the 90’s, but having 14 year olds with proportions of 17 year olds and the protagonist’s senpai being bodacious wasn’t a bad touch, but it gets very unsubtle when they started to show off a lot of skin (fan-service as they say). It even gets harder to explain in front of family members when they start showing off naked girls with missing private parts (I’m no longer going to dictate which episode that was, go find it yourselves).\nBut what really spiked the show above the charts that made it the standards of its time of being a psychological genre anime of it's time was the character development and presentation of every individual, yet significant characters in the story. I like how the devs managed to make a big impression in the lesser half of the show by showing the viewers how deep and twisted the characters mind is in such a short span, although it was as vague as it was short because they crammed it all in the end and made it look too fast paced. But of all the characters the devs had a car crash with the most, it was probably the protagonist because he had little to no character development in the entirety of the story and the way he was presented (being a wimp and always complaining about being a wimp) was just unpleasant and unsatisfying. His moment to shine was presented during the last two episodes of the show, and even that was too brief to be called an actual wholesome development of the protagonist. But with that been said, the character presentation of all the significant characters in the story, with the big exception of the protagonist, was well presented during the course of the whole show (the reason why the other main characters of the story was more favorable and iconic than the protagonist himself [although I have to admit, it was usually because of the moe, the fan-service, and because the protagonist was not likable in any way that they are more likable]).\nI’m going to separate this from the rest because this is the one that pressed my buttons the most, the serious lack of BGM was just screaming at my ear to make me almost drop this show during those boring first halves. You might think that ‘meh, what those BGM make significance over show? Hunga bunga?’ Well my friend, BGM is one of the very things that sets the overall emotion of the scene that you’re in on right now (the other one is how well the character can act the scene). If it wasn’t for BGM, major shows that bring you the hardest feels would just give you a reaction of ‘man, what the heck am I watching?’. It made a major impact at NGE that is just utterly soul crushing because the scenes that compose of mostly drama and feels, felt like an illogical argument of how much the protagonist didn’t want to pilot is cuddly robot.\nAnd that concludes the review. Love it or hate it (or you just didn’t understand), just put on a pretty face and carry on (and on, and on, etc.). Nobody will blame you if you didn’t like it. Nobody will be enthusiastic if you like it. After all, you exist to portray your opinion in your own little world, your world where you exist as the center of it all. Oh, and any reference that was given during the course of the review was all coincidental and accidental at the same time. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to stop this review and start looking for some fan art (whether it’s safe for work or not is still debatable).\n        "},

OP is just awesome. There were parts of Eva that I really loved, parts that I kinda hated, parts that made no sense, so coming to any final conclusion about this is tricky as I'm not sure when my Eva-induced headache is gonna be passing. There were definitely some things about it that were too what-the-fuck-am-I-watching, so I can't say I understood all of it. Actually, that level of how hard some of it is to grasp, makes me think\n          \n        that maybe those weren't presented or explained optimally. Kill la Kill is how I like my allegory, when the crucial parts are hard to miss. \nAnother downfall in Eva was religion. It's full of christian (and kabbalah) symbolism and blatantly preaches existence of souls. Anyways, I later confirmed that all of that is merely pretentious and adds nothing to show's actual themes and goals, it's just there to look or sound cool, as if this show needed to be more confusing then it already was. So it wasn't just me not getting it, it's actually ungettable. heh... \nWhat makes Eva special and kinda awesome, is how hard it tries to examine the human condition, and how it uses its characters to do so, and even how freakin far it's willing to go illustrate the human condition, and it indeed paints a most vivid illustration of it. More specifically it deals with connections between humans. It also illustrates depression and various other states of mind rather well. The infamous ending really takes everything up to eleven and ''I don't even...'' factor is... headache...\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=35,   ["text"]="                          \n    Story – 5/10\nThe two aspects of the story I am going to point out are the themes aboarded in the story and how that is done. The first , in my opinion, with a lot of potencial and the second which does not uses all that potencial.\nFirst of all, the superficial/inicial plot is not at all new. Boy gets to fight to save the earth while he lives a school life together with some girls and new friends. There I put one of my critics. The introduction is very badly done. To me, it just seems the direction was too eager to create that scenary\n          \n        previously described. Many aspects of the universe are not explained to the viewer, which ,on one hand, makes it difficult to understand everything but, on the other hand,  makes you  want to watch more.\nWith the development of the series, many other themes are added, which contributes to make me think that the middle of the anime is its best part. Trouble of socialization is aboarded with Shinji and Rei; paternal and maternal issues are aboarded with Shinji, Asuka and Katsuragi; existencial issues like the reason why one fights is aboarded with the main trio, mostly Asuka and Shinji, and like the truth of one’s world and how that person reacts to that. That said, the choice of the themes pleased me, but not how mostly of them were exploited. One instance is that the story develops these themes way too fast, not being developed for enough time , which difficults their comprehention. Also, there is a pacing problem because in one moment there is not any substancial development but in the next there is a huge amount of information rushed in the screen, which  also difficults the comprehention, resulting in an alternation between a too slow storytelling and a rushed storytelling. Also, other aspect that I dislike is that many events happen, but they do not seem to influence the future.\nAbout the ending, it not a really good one. Although some other existencial aspects are aboarded, which I liked, in this section, also, many informations and events are rushed, which unables them to be well explored, creating a trouble in understanding the anime’s conclusion. By the way, it is not near to be a good conclusion, because it finishes events that happen only in the last part of the anime and does not explain many aspects of that universe, leaving many subjects and characters aside and viewers confused.\nThus, Evangelion ends up being a story that talks about good themes, but that does not give them enough time to be developed and that ends up being confusing and not well finished.\nArt – 7/10\nIn the first two thirds of the anime the art is not exquisite, but is good. The drawning is good and stylish, the animation is fluid when it has to be. Nevertheless, the concepts of the art are a two edged knife. While the city and NERV’s base are very serious and futuristic, the EVAs’ and the Angels’ appearances distune of the anime’s atmosphere. They sure do look awesome, what is a good thing, but they are way to stylish and colourfull to the setting of the anime.\nIn the end of the anime, putting its difficulty of understandment, there was used some interesting visual effects. The narrative uses a lot of alternative arts like the manga drawnings or simple drawnings in a white screen, with water painting. This results in unique and interesting way to communicate the character’s confusion to the viewers.\nSound – 5/10\nFirst, about the dubbing. The main trio is perfectly enpersonated by the dubbers. Shinji’s shyness, Asuka’s pride and arrogance and Rei’s lack of emotion are completely transmitted by their voices. That also happens to the side characters, although less noticeable. Thus, the dubbing is very good.\nAbout the soundtrack, I can say the direction uses the silence better than it uses soundtrack. The silence and ordinary sounds are commonly, and perfectly, used to express the awkwardness of the situation or the solitude of the ambient. On the other hand , it does not uses music, most of the times, in the best moments it could, like the battle scenes, and when it uses, it is usually a soundtrack that distunes from the anime’s setting and that barely helps the build up of the scene.\nCharacters – 7/10\nAs the story, this aspect of the anime had a great potencial, which was not well explored. \nThe trio of main characters is very good. Everyone of them has a unique personality and issues, and all of them give the story a chance to talk and to develop good subjects. Also, their interactions with one another are really fun. Nevertheless, they were not completely explored. First of all, they do not receive a proper ending. Also, they lose screen time in spite of the development of side characters and events that are neither as interesting nor as important as they are. Thus, some of their characteristics and story are not as developed as they could be.\nAbout the side characters, they are not all bad , but they are indeed worse than the main trio. Also their development was a bad call from the direction because by the end of the anime, they try to implement and to create importance and background to a lot of characters, which results in little screen time for any of them and , thus, in a superficial development.\nEntertainment – 6/10\nAgain I am going to praise the trio of main characters while I think the most of the rest of the anime is just satisfactory. \nShinji, Asuka and Rei have different personalities. During the anime, they clash and interact with one another. It is really fun to watch this process, mostly when we have Asuka’s spontaneity and pride facing Shinji’s shyness and Rei’s indifference. \nOther cool aspect of the series are the EVAs’ scenes. Most of them are really cool and, besides almost always having the same “Angel appears and we stop it” formula, they manage to have some diversity of in how the problem of the episode is solved.\nNevertheless, there is one big defect, at least in my experience watching the anime, that is one retrospect of the story. While the plot is being developed and you are being overwhelmed by information, the entertainment of the anime is seriously jeopardized by the confusing narrative, mostly in the end of the series, because of the difficulty in understanding what is going on.

Look I get this is considered by many as a cornerstone in Anime history and highly loved. But it just was just not my cup of LCL. The story was woefully under developed and hard to follow. Episodes are disjointed and never clarified. Look I like shows that manage to be open ended and left to interpretation as the next guy, but my God, this show is all over the place. You could make assumptions about what happens to specific\n          \n        characters to get your own idea about who that character really is I guess. BUT the reason that isn't redeeming is because you don't like any of these characters. Shinji is honestly the most infuriating character in any show I've ever watched by far. Asuka just comes off as incessantly whiny and selfish to no end. Rei has a few glimmers of hope at times but for the most part is deadpan. Misato carries the show as the one comic relief and only enjoyable presence as she searches for clues as to what the hell this show is about. The ending just felt lazy and aggravating because by that point your starved for answers only to be slapped in the face by more pointless babbling. No real feeling of closure was given, even if I tried to make my own meaning of this steamy mess of \"plot points\". In closing I can't say my continued patience with this show or effort to understand it have paid off at all. Which is why personally I gave it such a low score. Ultimately I don't understand why this show is so acclaimed and enjoyed but if it were up to me I'd have to say stay away from this one.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=36,   ["text"]="                          \n    So I've written some pretty negative reviews about a lot of I guess kind of dark and bitter anime.. but here is an opportunity to make a more positive one! (Edit: I also edited to kind of change a few things.. sorry!)\nNGE I remember people seeing it back when and it being renowned for being metaphysical, philosophical, perverted, goofy, running out of money, all kinds of stories and possibilities along with a controversial ending, and now the passage of time, seem to have obsfuscated this anime somewhat, which is a shame because it's still more interesting than a lot of those others which seem to\n          \n        have disappeared... \nI think the thing about NGE is it is APOCALYPTIC. Sorry to use all caps there, ^_^. I mean, it's themes are very intense I think in many ways, the people of Tokyo-7 which is like this newer city built basically into the earth so that it can be defended against the attacks of angels, which are these crazy looking giant monster sort of things. \nThey are basically bent on reaching the internal level of NERV, which is like an Avengers styled secret defense agency which is like focused on defending against the Angel attack and so on and so forth. \nThe attacks sabotage and demoralize Tokyo-7 and it's citizens, all of them kind of suffering in the middle of this chaos. It's a very bitter and dark anime, lots of things go wrong and it gets really messy! However, I wouldn't say it was actually so un-fun as a consequence, in contrast to the idea that it was overly phiosophical or distant I thought it was interesting precisely because it was not metaphysical, philosophical, (particularly) perverted, or aimless. \nNo in fact what NGE demonstrates to me is some measure of restraint, and unwillingness to rely on particularly safe endings and instead opting for full destruction... and focuses more simply on people's day to day interactions and small differences of emotion or desire that make people better understand one another. \nOne part of Evangelion that people seem to take issue is this sense that the characters/ending are a bit chaotic and there's sort of this wild element, and that's sort of a running theme through the ending and what not, and which struck many as psuedo-philosphical and so on, and yet while true the series (and character) have a habit of spinning slightly out of orbit, it's never an excess that defeats the internal thematic power of Evangelion. \nMoreover, the general tendencies for characters to spin out of orbit part and the chaos is part of the charm, the series isn't going to hold your hand, it's going to fly off the handle so if you want a more predictable experience better to stay away.\nThe funny thing is though even if you take all the aspects I don't like about NGE, add them together, and then take all the things I like it about it, there is still a fun thing there, despite it being fairly intense. \nThe best way to summarize Evangelion is that it's kind of like the ultimate \"anime\" anime, like, you are getting this experience of an anime at it's rawest, lots of the goofy elements, kind of there in raw form, the jokes, comedy (yes there are jokes and comedy), the kind of resentment towards traditional heroic themes.\nIt's easily the most intense encapsulation, the only other thing I've come across at similar intensity (for that kind of dynamic) is Bakemonogatari which is, for all it's theatrics, somewhat toned down. \nSo yeah. NGE was pretty interesting, but it's also not necessarily #1.. but if you are newer to anime and want to see one of the kind of core elements of it then you should definitely check out Evangelion because you probably won't find anything that expresses that ethos at a similar level. \n\n\n\n\n"},

This was so close to being a masterpiece but those last 2 episodes left a bad taste in my mouth. Even though I gave it an 8/10, this is one of my favorites.\nStory- 7/10\nVery good anime that has its moments. Really liked the idea of EVAs fighting Angels, very unique. This is one of the anime that got me addicted, always telling myself \"1 more episode.\" Halfway through the story starts getting complicated and dark. The action was pleasing to the eyes.\nArt- 8/10\nIt was made in 1995 what do you expect?\n          \n        Really liked the detail on the EVAs and Tokyo-3. \nSound- 10/10\nThe soundtrack perfectly matches the scenes playing. The iconic OP is so catchy and is one of my favorites, but if you look up the lyrics for it, it's all about Shinji. Not only does this anime make me look forward for the next episode, but the next ending song as well. First time I heard it , I quickly recognized that this is one of the songs my grandma listens to.\nCharacter- 8/10\nDon't get me wrong but if you were a 14 year old and is piloting a giant Mecha, most of you would probably be freaking out. What really troubles me is that Shinji stays a wuss. At moments I was hoping, Oh man this is the time he'll become a badass but sadly no. I thought he would grow a backbone once in a while like Simon from Gurren Lagann. All the characters looked normal but they all have psychological problems. The character that really stood out was Asuka. She brings life to the episodes she's in also I love it when she bullies stupid Shinji\nEnjoyment-  10/10\nOverall I enjoyed it, it was a fun ride while it lasted. A memorable series made a couple months before I was even born. The dub was decent there was times when some of the voice actors sounded like a cartoon. I probably would watch this a second time in the future. This is one of the anime people should watch before they die.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=45,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Why am I touching on this again? Because this time I want to try a more 'formal' analysis. Evangelion is basically a textbook on editing for powerful effect. The lessons to be gleaned from its bold and daring cinematography gives it an edge over basically almost every show out there formal structure-wise.\nI already made a blog post on this but I still think its a technique that really more people need to be aware of, that is of his 'pregnant silences'. In my blog post I went through a list of the 26 ending shots of each episode to see how many of them used\n          \n        silence as opposed to any type of music in the shot. Some of his endings even cut of exactly at the moment when a character finishes a bit of dialogue or the dialogue carries over into the 'to be continued' image. The most daring was probably Episode 12's ending since it ended one of the most seemingly banal shots (of them eating ramen) at the end of Asuka's comment about Shinji. Episode 2, 10, 15, 16, 20, 21, 22, 24 also stand out. The MOST daring AND brilliant though was End of Evangelion's sudden cut which is basically one of the most lauded and memorable moments in anime even today. The note which that finale ends on literally resounds throughout everyone in the cinema.\nAnno knows that the ending of an episode is the 'definite' end, the ultimate full stop that the viewer experiences. He leaves his last words for these full-stops to give them the ultimate weight. It's a shame that not enough people learned from his dramatic manipulation especially considering that now everyone writes ED songs that have beginnings which carry over into the ending shot so that the ending of an episode ties in to the ED. Now everyone wants to end on a note that's full of fire and power. Of course this isn't wrong and there are great uses of it (FMA:B Elric bursting back through the gate to shout to his brother) but sometimes separating the ED song and the final shot is the best way to go. Even the maddening ending of Inception had to have the semi-transcendent music to emphasize the weight of the top spin. Just thing how much more powerful it would have been if Nolan left it silent.\nThis technique isn't new though. If you watch the ending of Godard's Vivre sa Vie its basically one of the things that makes to movie so memorable. Synecdoche New York, though it doesn't end with complete silence, also cuts the music at the last word to leave a pregnant almost-silence (there's still the beeping of electronics).\nThe other thing is his fast flashbacks. This, likewise, probably isn't new. The example that most comes to my head is Haneke's Cache where we're suddenly thrown contextless images which are eventually revealed to be different parts of the main protagonist's childhood throughout the whole film. These are short cuts that make it seem as if the unconscious or memory itself is slowly intruding into the present. Anno does this with shots such as the first episode where Shinji seems to see Rei in the street (Though this shot ends with the sound of birds) or the scene where Shinji recounts Rei wringing the washcloth like a mother or of course the shots of him crying like a child. Yet those that are silent, like Haneke's flashbacks, bear the most weight. I don't think Anno has done a sudden contextless flashback to a completely different scene the way Haneke has though.\nNow to talk about the silences that occur within the episode rather than at the end of the episode. Anno is, of course, famous for his long silent or dramatic takes, especially in a medium that doesn't like to draw out the length of their shots so much. The most memorable is the ending of episode 24 with classical music but he's also great at having long awkward moments in lifts or going up elevators. The 'runaway' stretch in episode 4, though not being a single long cut, is just pure atmospheric silence with only ambient noises. The ambient noise crescendos during the 'red screen' moment to show Shinji's existential uncertainty and confusion.\nI should one day do a shot breakdown analysis of the 'runaway' stretch just as an example of a great atmosphere setting moment in animation.\nWhich animator, of an action sci-fi series no less, is ever willing to take the breaks to action that Anno does? Episode 15 is just a pure character exploration episode, a breather (though not any less emotional) before the non-stop descent into madness. Panty and Stocking's single shot sofa episode comes to mind but that was just a comedic experimental interlude. Most 'filler episodes' that cut the action tend to be about silly things like going to the beach or just having fun. Evangelion makes its breather episode a psychological breakdown of the various character's longing for company and human connection.\nOnly Anno uses silence the way he does. Steins;Gate uses light banter to create a great balanced pace between plot development and tension. Nagi no Asukara uses beautiful scenery and banter as well. Yet in the end these techniques still want to derive some form of entertainment or emotional lightness from us. Only Anno would grab us and hold us down with an almost complete abolishment of any lightness or comedy whatsoever yet still create releases from the great tension that takes place between action or stretches of madness.\nThis is only the tip of the iceberg. There's an entire wealth of techniques to uncover. How to manipulate shots for emotional crescendoes, how to get by on a low budget, how to hinge character personalities on psychological theories, how to use color for disorientation... Hopefully I'll eventually be able to plunge into all that Evangelion has to offer.\n(Now the 'runaway' scene from episode 4 shot-by-shot breakdown is on my blog.)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=44,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion (or Shinseiki Evangelion, for the purists) is undoubtedly one of the most controversial yet influential animes of the 90's, and is still a classic. It is called a masterpiece by some, a total failure by others. But what is it really ? I guess you can only know after having watched the anime. But I'll try to give you a bit of an answer with this review.\nStory 8/10\nEvangelion is a very tough work to review, and one of the tough parts is the story. \nYou can cut it in three parts. The first one goes from the first episode to the seventh.\n          \n        It's not really bad, just repetitive; it's the \"villain of the week\" kind of story, which quickly gets boring. But it never does, mainly because of the beginning of the second part of the show in episode 8, marked by the appearance of a new character : Asuka. From episode 8 to 24, the story becomes more linear and displays its true potential. \nThe last part, on the other hand, is completely different. It's comprised of the last two episodes, which we can describe by the word \"mindfuck\". Except if you are an expert in philosophy and psychology. This part is what made Evangelion so controversial. Personally, I loved it. But most people didn't. Which I totally understand.\nArt 8/10\nAgain, something tough to review. \nWhy ? Because, while the art is great, the animation goes from beautifully animated scenes, which should still be standards for today's animation to fixated plans and horribly animated shots. \nWhy ? Because of the incredibly short budget the team had, particularly in the last episodes, which led in the mindfuck I talked about earlier, which, animation-wise, is not what you could call something great. To speak clearly, it sucked. But this was counterbalanced by the gorgeous action scenes and beautiful mechas.\nSound 10/10\nWhat can I say about Evangelion's soundtrack ? The opening is a masterpiece and one of the best of all time, the OST is beautiful, perfectly fitting the atmosphere, and the ending was not so bad. I guess there isn't much more to say.\nCharacters 10/10\nThe hardest part of this show. The characters. Everyone of them, every single part of the cast, is heavily psychologically damaged. Most of them are hated (I'm looking at you Shinji, you fucking twat), but that's what makes them unique. This must be the most objective part of my review, because the characters are just so complex yet believable, yet so hated and popular, you can only have your own opinion. I loved them, that's why I've given a 10 on the characters.\nEnjoyment 9/10\nThe enjoyment part of this review is really hard. While I loved watching it, I have to confess it is a really hard watch sometimes. But it's still great.\nOverall 9/10\nI would have given Evangelion a 10/10 ( it's a 10 on my list), but I'm trying to be a little subjective here. This anime is highly experimental and very weird, yet a masterpiece. Do I recommend you to watch it ? Yes. At any cost. Even causing the Third Impact and having all mankind dying. But be warned : you will have a hard time understanding all of this show, and I highly recommend you to watch it a second time, after having read some analysis .\nThanks for reading this review ! If you disagree, want to know something, or just want to say hello, just message me !\n        "},

While I will recognize the popularly-criticized lower points of the show related to its budget cuts later into the series, I must say these hardly affected my overall enjoyment of the show in an signicant way.  The complex yet deeply intriguing plot, in-depth character development, phenomenal soundtrack and often beautifully vintage imagery\n          \n        all together completely earned my personal ranking of my favorite anime series I have viewed thus far.\n        "},

It's name everyone should know. This series is really popular in all over world. It's praised by many people and also same time hated by many people it's maintaining these things equally.\nCreator Hideki Anno didn't actually wanted people to enjoy this series at first place and how could really anyone enjoy it if creator is having psychological issues himself when he was making this series. That's why there are many versions so everyone could be happy and get story they want.\nI wont mention\n          \n        any spoiler stuff because there is all ready many good reviews of this series and they explain all really well.\nThe thing is that what Evangelion do unique way is storytelling actually putting people to think everything about themselves, The World, Life, Society, Mankind and even Gods. It solves many riddles but still left too many questions to unanswered. \nStory - 9\nEvangelion story is really complex and deep but it's made some sense to me. I wasn't really expecting so complex story even I knew this was psychological show. Stil it's breathtaking and does job well until 2nd part starts where series take turns and true nature becomes showing to people. It's unique story cause many anime's don't tell this kind of story like way Evangelion presents it.\nArt - 10\nEven this anime is made 1995 it's look really beautiful and they must been watching Dragon Ball Z because animation looks like that. It's bit oldish but nothing is too bright or too dark.\nEVA's look really detailed and their moving is just amazing to watch. Camera view is also pretty unique in this anime. It's not typical chancing next scene but it actually spinning through out series.\nBig fancy font's they go nicely  with psychology stuff included in episode title texts. And symbolism even this wasn't never to mean anything it gave series many meanings still. Oh and those final episode that crowned everything. Pretty interesting way to animate scenes.\nMusic - 10\nEvangelion has so great music collections found. that I was just feeling those tunes in anime. Without music battle scenes would look boring but with music they really came to live. There were some music that had weird place in scenes but still many great choices and interacting with symbolism.\nMain theme is like mix of maracas, trumpets and jazz. it starts with slow and quickly changes form to quck in middle way. Shiro Sagisu is really great music composer I really like his music it fit into series really well. Ending theme had nicely dynamic theme and moon reflection I think it's unique concept showing ending and always different tempo in each episode.\nEffects - 10\nEven this is 1995 anime it's not definitely showing in effects. bombs, flashes sounds like they should be. Also environment like rain, and when cascades makes sounds it's almost like in Higurashi. Which means they really delivered with effects. Just amazing stuff.\nVoice Acting - 10\nI liked all voices too be honest I first hated Shinji's voice it was too deep and it just gave me headache to listen it. But later his voice turned well and I began to like it. Overall all characters especially Rei's voice actor did awesome work. They really felt characters and learned them. And also learn how to use own voice to deliver nice viewing and hearing experiences to audience.\nThe Characters - 10\nThese is one of the  best shows that character development is taking seriously and I mean really seriously. Every characters story is really deep and depressing stuff to see but it really shows how much they progress through out series. And almost every important character get's own past story to maximum own character development. But there is one character that get's most of it and it's none other than Shinji.\nShinji's role in Evangelion is so huge and everything that happens with his character shows in his character personally perfectly. He progress nicely through out series and viewer get's to see how Shinji will do in his journey to clear his mind of things that he is thinking particularly. And that's why Shinji is really different from Shonen characters like Naruto or Ichigo. That's why he is unique character and overall critical point understanding whole plot in the series. But I would say all characters are just as important like Shinji. Everyone share same feelings and emotions.\nEnjoyment - 9\nI really did enjoy Evangelion. This wasn't first anime I watched and noticed you really need to think a lot but it was first anime that mentioned psychology really well in form and all important stuff that is needed to survive in world. Personally I would wanted to know what really happened into plot but it's nice they make movies to get everyone clear picture what happened in it.\nOverall - 9\nEvangelion is anime that is setting your mind in thinking mode and let's you form own image of the plot and characters how they relate to each others and it's let you feel these in your mind too. Maybe weird way to say but it's just goes deeply into person's mind and wants them to solve riddles that it will  presents in anime. \nEvangelion is series that everyone can sure relate to because it gives so realistic viewpoint of world and stuff. Of course many people may hate ending and I don't like it myself either because all that confusing stuff .But that's why they gave us choices movies and alternative way escaping that freaking mind game.\nI highly recommend watching this series even if you're not psychological anime fan or dislike that genre. And all Sci-Fi people should watch this too.\nEvangelion is and will always remembered in anime community it's not going to change and it's always going to be one of the anime series that lend people to psychological series and those aspects overall.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=43,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    I went in to Evangelion with the assumption it was an overrated anime exclusively loved by pretentious hipsters with a deep hatred for 21st century anime. But by the end of it I can honestly say it is in my top 5 shows of all time. This anime definitely isn't for everyone, but i'll try to explain why I loved it so much. \nPLOT (8/10) \nThe basic plot follows a \"monster of the week\" style, in which a new giant more powerful angel levels the city on a weekly basis and is then destroyed by a screaming 14 year old in a giant robot. (Not\n          \n        the most appealing premise I know, considering this is considered an \"intellectual\" anime by many). There are also plenty of ridiculous moments, such as sniping a giant cube with all the country's electric and synchronized dancing (yes really) \nHowever the show has some very good action scenes as you would expect from the genre. There is also a good element of mystery in the series as the characters begin to question what the eva's and angels actually are. The show has many shining moments and continually improves as the show goes on, with my personal favorites being episodes 13, 16,18, 19, 23 and 24. The film \"End of Evangelion\" is also necessary to watch after the show is over in order to get full closure on the plot (it's awesome to). \nCHARACTERS (10/10) \nA lot of people will hate the characters of evangelion because of how flawed the pilot's personalities are (i.e. they're whining little shits) However it was just how flawed each character was that really made me love the show. Each character is a psychological mess, clearly suffering from a complete cocktail of mental disorders including: Post Traumatic Stress, Parental Issues and a self esteem level in the third floor basement. Watching each of the characters scrape together their shattered psyche and stay sane just long enough to delay the apocalypse another week was incredibly interesting, particularly towards the end of the show where they truly begin to totally break down. \n ANIMATION (6/10) \nThis is arguably the weakest point of the show, the series came out in 1995 so naturally the art style is very dated and unappealing to those not used to older anime. The quality of the animation varies a lot, with the fight scenes being amazingly fluid, especially for the time. But as the budget runs out we're left with long still shots descending into basically audio only. \nSOUNDTRACK (7/10) \nThe opening song is very good and suits the anime well with its fast moving visuals. The ending however is a still shot and an \"engrish\" song that doesn't suit my personal tastes. The rest of the OST is fairly decent (even if a certain song was a james bond rip off) \nENJOYMENT (10/10) \nNot much more to say here as I hope I've explained why I personally like it so much, I hope you do to. \n"},

Review #3: Neon Genesis Evangelion\nIn the Year 2000, a disastrous event known as \"The Second Impact\" occurs. Antarctica has been destroyed and half of the human race has been annihilated. Gee! That is sure a way to start a new millennium. 15 years later (which is where the story begins) The Angels arrive. Shinji Ikari is summoned by his father who requests Shinji to pilot a giant mechanical humanoid known as the Evangelion...\nI don't even think I need to say any more about the plot, because I think that most of the\n          \n        Otakus in the world know what the story is about. It is a very popular anime in Japan and America and maybe other countries. It is also a very controversial one at that.\nWith that said, I will give my case on this puzzling thriller. The show may have a following, but I hope what I say what is bad about the show may not piss everyone off. I like this anime, but I think the show has its strengths and weaknesses. So, without further ado... I will state my case about this classic anime known as Neon Genesis Evangelion.\nCASE 1: The Story and it's themes\nI will say that the direction of the story on its first few episodes is great. I like that the first episode gives the main character an introduction while not saying too much about him. I found the direction unique still at first. However the direction of the story isn't consistent at all. It jumps from giving out a unique start, then it turns into Robot vs. Monster episodes and when the show gets into its last third, it then jumps into a complex and Psychological direction mixed into action packed episodes. The direction is kind of a mess, the pacing is consistent, but it's still interesting to watch. if there is any themes that I think worked for the show was some of the religious symbolism and even some of the philosophical ideas such as The Hedgehog's dilemma and even existentialism themes such as Individuality, consciousness, freedom, choice, and responsibility, and hell... even some Freudian tropes are thrown in too. If there is anything that doesn't seem right is that it attempts to use these themes and play it along like it's trying to make Evangelion a smart anime. This anime will guarantee a high re-watch value, but it may still be confusing to understand. The use of the themes portrayed in the show however may not work for some.\nCASE 2: The Animation, is it really a work of art?\nThis is a bit of a mixed bag to talk about. The animation for the show is what you would expect from a mid-90's anime. It is old but it still looks great... Actually, I may have to take that comment back at some point because there are some problems with the animation in the show. Gainax was under quite a budget during the making of Evangelion. This resulted in certain scenes being recycled, some scenes that are barely moving, and also led to the often criticized and mostly loathed final two episodes.\nI don't think I even need to bring up these final episodes, but I will...\nThe final two episodes of this show confused and alienated the fans of the show. It kind of made no sense, the animation was poor and it feels like you are being slapped in the face. Is the animation good at this point? Hell no! Was it mostly good in the long run? hard to say, but its decline in quality really did hurt the show at the time. It should be noted that this ending takes place in Shinji's mind which I guess this theory would support the defense of this ending but is worth seeing but I won't guarantee you'll want to rewatch it unless you actually liked the ending.\nCASE 3: The Voice Actors\nThe subtitled version is very well casted; the English dub is a bit off in some areas. You can't really go wrong with subs here. Megumi Ogata, Megumi Hayashibara, Yuko Miyamura, Kotono Mitsuishi, and other cast members of the show really nailed their roles perfectly well. The dub may vary your mileage here. Spike Spencer is very well known for voicing Shinji. I have heard better from him, I did not like his performance in the dub. Tiffany Grant is mostly \"Wunderbar\" as Asuka, Amanda Winn-Lee is hit and miss as Rei, and Tristan MacAvery as Gendo was pretty good. Most of the cast members of the dub are hit and miss. The English cast during the Director's Cut episodes does have some slight cast changes. I am in more favor of the subtitled version than the dub. I have seen the entire dub and I might as well point out that the dub does take a little getting to used to and I'll give Amanda Winn-Lee and Matt Greenfield some credit for improving the dub little by little. Also, There is a Easter egg on the 7th Platinum Edition Volume and it's pretty damn funny...\nCASE 4: The Music\nThe music is composed by Shiro Sagisu; you may have heard his name in another popular anime known as Bleach. I love the soundtrack of Evangelion. It still sounds good today. I do like the use of classical music that was used for the show, even though the use of \"Hallelujah\" was used when Asuka was being mind-raped. But Episode 24 has the most epic use of Ode To Joy. It is still awesome. If only the show included Mahler's Eighth Symphony or Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra, then it will be ten times more awesome. Air is in The End of Evangelion, but that's not what I am reviewing yet. Air is another good classical song. Another strong point of the music is its opening theme. A Cruel Angel's Thesis has been regarded as one of the greatest anime openings ever made and it is extremely hard not to like, the lyrics may not fit the show but this one has a place with a lot of otakus. This is also the first anime opening I have seen in my life, so I have fond memories with this opening. It was great back then and it has aged well.\nCASE 5: The Characters, (A.T. Field Full Power)\nAnother thing that may vary your mileage in this show may be the characters themselves, Shinji Ikari is a mixed bag, and you either sympathize with him because he is anxious about his current position or you loathe him because he doesn't want to pilot a giant robot in order to save mankind thus making him a pussy. Of all the things I have seen in that show. I have observed that he has problems. I do feel sorry for the position he is currently in but he really needs to grow a pair of balls, drop them, and fight like a man. Some people find Rei one-dimensional, I almost could say that, but I like her mysterious personality. Asuka really made the show entertaining. Misato is an interesting case, Gendo is sort of badass LIKE A BOSS! (he might be slightly one-dimensional, but he was kind of alright), Kaji was cool, and Kaworu deserved more screentime instead of only appearing in one episode. Speaking of Kaworu, we all know the gay overtones and speculation between Shinji and Kaworu, all thanks to this scene I have here.\n Anyway, some characters are great, some just need to be developed a little bit more.\nCASE 6: Hideaki Anno... What makes him a unique director?\nLet me inform you of the anime director that made an interesting innovative move to the mecha genre. It seemed to be just a mecha anime but Hideaki Anno deconstructs the mecha genre into a character study rife with psychological analysis, religious references, social commentaries, and explorations of themes such as societal alienation, depression, and the repressive pain of human subjectivity. If what I said goes way over your head, then I apologize. Some otakus have seen this approach out of the ordinary, unprecedented, and revolutionary. After its success, many anime producers have created shows with a similar approach. This is the anime that has defined Anno-san's career. Back then he suffered through personal battles of depression at the time Evangelion was being created and that directly inspired the themes for this anime. This anime has also led quite an impact for animes to come.\nCASE 7: Why Am I writing reviews?\nI really have a knack for critiquing stuff and I have fun doing that. I have such a passion for the arts whether its literature, art, animation, music, you name it. the reason I chose to review anime is because not every single anime is perfect and I like to pinpoint what's good and bad about some animes with some constructive criticism. Critiquing anime has been a hobby of mine for a while and I still enjoy this hobby. With that said, this is kind of pointless to the review and you probably already noticed that I am sort of making fun of the crappy final 2 episodes of the show already, and I really don't want to say this but...\nCONGRATULATIONS\nThis anime was available by ADV films and was out of print for sometime until Section23 Films rescued this anime. The two follow up movies, Death and Rebirth, which is a recap and teaser for the next movie, The End Of Evangelion (which either replaces the final two episodes or contemplates the final two episodes) were also available by Manga Entertainment. They are unfortunately out of print unless someone rescues it. The manga adaptation of the same name by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto is available from Viz Media, Spinoff mangas such as Angelic Days, Shinji Ikari Raising Project, and Campus Apocalypse are also available from Viz Media. A remake series which is notably called The Rebuild Of Evangelion is available from Funimation, at the time I am doing this review, Only 2 movies have been released.\nWith all that said, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a very unique series that has some interesting ideas but it is a difficult show to understand which gives Neon Genesis Evangelion a huge rewatch value. It does have animation problems, but has some great action scenes, This is definitely for Sci-fi buffs out there and this was my gateway to anime. I find this anime overrated to an extent but It is still a classic. It is a must see but I can't guarantee that it is a must-love.\nI give Neon Genesis Evangelion a 8.4 out of 10. It is VERY GOOD!\nFeel free to leave a comment. God's In His Heaven, All's Right With The World.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=43,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    A masterpiece of modern animation or art for that matter, Hideaki Anno's Neon Genesis Evangelion, is without a doubt the deepest, most brillaint and profound anime I have ever seen.\nPrologue: In the year 2000 a giant being explodes, destroying nearly the entire continent of Antarctica, consequent global flooding and causing the deaths of half the human population. The impact also caused a change in the earth's axial tilt and subsequent unrest. \nBasic Plot:\nShinji Ikari is called to pilot a giant mecha by his father, head of the secret government organization, NERV. Shinji is picked up by Misato Katsuragi, who soon becomes his guardian. When Shinji\n          \n        gets to NERV, he is asked to pilot a mecha known as an Evangelion. After some hesitation, Shinji reluctantly agrees to pilot the Evangelion unit 01. With the Evangelions, Shinji and the other pilots fight the giant creatures known as the Angels, to stop them from causing the third impact and the end of the world.\nStory: 10\nEvangelion's story may seem to be that of any other mecha anime at first, but soon shows it's true genius and originality. Evangelion is much, much more than just an entertaining mecha anime. The overall plot is layered with many levels of depth and meanings intertwining to produce Hideaki Anno's message. It should also be noted that many of the plot details are subtle some seem to be left unexplained but fear not, they can be found out with analysis and research.  Before director Anno started work on Evangelion, he was going through a time of deep depression and Anno once said that through Evangelion he sought to express his innermost thoughts and that he was trying to \"burn his feelings into film\" in making Evangelion. \nArt: 10\nThe art in Evangelion is used to it's fullest. Anno uses rich visual craft to express his ideas and reinforce the narative. Whether it be Shinji's headphones, Gendos glasses  the AT field, etc. being used to demonstrate the hedgehog's dilemma or a medium shot of Gendo and Shinji/Misato standing at opposite ends of the frame, at a completely inverted angle, Evangelion is rich in visual genius.\nSound: 10\nThe music in Evangelion is appropriately used to reinforce the narrative as well. With a mix of classical music and synthesized rythmic tracks, Eva's sound distinguishes itself quite well. \nCharacters: 10\nThe characters conditions and how they interact with others play a huge role in Neon Genesis Evangelion. Each character is in some way, psychologically troubled an their individual situations are revealed and analyzed throughout the series. Shinji, for example, lacks self worth and suffers from chronic depression throughout the series. It should also be noted that the characters draw many parallels to Anno's own personality and characteristics.\nEnjoyment: 10\nOne of the things that makes Evangelion so great is that it can be enjoyed on many levels. It can be enjoyed at face value, as an expertly done apocalyptic mecha series and a satire of the mecha genre and at the same time viewers can enjoy it on its deeper levels, as a story of depression and psychological rejuvenation. Understanding as close to 100% of NGE as possible requires a great amount of analysis and research, so much so that I doubt if any human being will ever understand it fully. Knowing this, Evangelion provides for countless re viewings. Evangelion was extremely enjoyable for me. \nOverall: 10\nWhether it be the expert entertaining qualities, the genius use of visual craft to express the narrative, the realism and complexity of the characters, or the relate-ability to it's audince, everything about Evangelion makes it a masterpiece in so many ways. Hideaki Anno, in expressing his feelings in Evangelion, has given a resounding sense of understanding to all vievers who have ever felt the same. Not to mention push the limits of what an anime can do. That is what makes Evangelion stand out from almost every other anime as a truly profound, influential and meaningful work. \n\n"},

I can only say how it affected me and I hope that is enough to convince whoever reads this to watch it.\n___1___\nNeon Genesis Evangelion has been always there for me. Ever since I was very young I saw commercials for it, I dug the hell out of the character and mecha designs and the opening song for it is simply unforgettable. These are all \"small\" things that stuck with me for 15 years. I also knew what the loudest opinions of it were like: \nEither \"It's too complicated, artsy, presumptuous and boring\",\n          \n        or \"It's literally the best anime ever and it's the reasons why I'm alive today.\".\nThis kind of drove me away from it. I felt like there was too much outside of it, surounding it for me to dive into.\nAs I grew to enjoy the technical aspects of writing and animation however, Evangelion kept popping up in conversations. I couldn't -NOT- watch it anymore. And I am now old enough that I believe myself to be capable of fully enjoying and understanding the show.\n___2___\nThe show starts from a classic premise of Monsters vs Mecha, with some religious references thrown in for context and dramatic effect, but you are regularly given hints that they are not the main point of it. They are a means to an end. They exist to illustrate who the characters truly are by showcasing how they deal with the situation at hand, with each other and most importantly, with themselves.\nFrom it's midpoint, that initial premise becomes no more than a backdrop. Something to give you a quick jolt of \"Mecha\" fights with masterful production. From then on it's a heavy show. It's heavy in tone and it's heavy in production talent. It's heavily introspective, as great part of the \"action\" starts taking place within the character's minds, through the use of abstract and surreal imagery.\nAll the \"EVA 2 DEEP 4 U\" jokes and memes almost seem justified, at this point. At face value, it seems like a descent into the ridiculous of psychoanalysis and metaphor abuse. But NGE is not a show that you can interpret at face value, putting it on the background as you do something else. It's something you sit down, turn your brain on, watch, question, and finally, understand.\nIf there's one thing that I could single out to be truly masterful about it, it's how Hideaki Anno, as director of the show, managed to weave together complex psychological themes and tendencies of each character, with the universe's own Sci-fi mythology of post-apocalyptic existence. How each defining instance of a character's story is, at it's core, something realistic and possible in our world (loss, rejection, insecurity...), but in NGE, is combined to one of the various concepts within the show, wether it's the origin of Eva Units, the effects of the 2nd Impact, or any other story element.\n___3___\nFinally, I can't say I regret having waited 15 years to watch it, as it requires a certain level of maturity to appreciate it.\nBut what I can say is that when the last frame of the \"End of Evangelion\" movie flashed on screen, I felt truly rewarded. \nDefinitely a must-watch.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=32,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Firstly, this anime is a deconstruction anime. \nIt subverts the genre of mecha animes, which are predominately story focused and action-orientated (and for young teens/children) and instead adds psychological realism of a post -war mentality. So yes, the story isn't as comprehensive and complex, but that's the point. \nIf you haven't guessed, the anime is almost entirely character driven and where the story may seem somewhat underdeveloped, it is purposefully constructed so that a character dominated narrative can lead. \nThe story takes place within characters and between characters, drifting away from the bigger overall scenario they find themselves in. It presents quintessential stock characters, stripping\n          \n        them back to reveal deeper, more complex layers of their construction. Some characters don't change, some progress and some deteriorate in their deconstruction. No one is ultimately how they appear, and this anime really explores the idea of false appearances behind repressed identities. \nThe real battle happens internally, mentally and psychologically with each character through an existential, psycho-freudian lens.  \nThe anime delves into the how internal struggles such as insecurities, mistakes, fear, and the past plague and form human nature. How the noise in our head drowns out the wider world around us and how our weaknesses and insecurities define us. It's especially poignant as the mecha-anime genre is about the birth of a hero and saving the world; in Neon Genesis Evangelion, the characters are imperfect, fighting the negative reality of who they really are and the irony behind these characters being the individuals who try to save the world. It ultimately is one of the most honest portrayals of characters, and you cannot help but grow attached to them as you begin to recognise the shared similarities between yourself and them. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=42,   ["text"]="                          \n    Evangelion. One of the craziest things I have ever watched. It’s really hard doing a review about this show. But I’ll try my best to do it without any spoiler.\n\nFirst off, I want to tell you—the reader, that I have only watched the series last two weeks. So I’m not particular with the movies and the upcoming ones. So my knowledge about the whole thing is limited. So please enlighten me if I make (will make, surely) a mistake, ok? Will be happy if you teach this uninformed dummy here. So I will start my honest review about the show.\n\nStory: 8\nEverybody loves Shinji-Kun’s dad—Ikari Gendou.\n          \n        The end. Jk. Only half, though. Kidding aside, the story’s about Ikari Shinji, a 14-year-old kid who’s got serious introvert problems. He is forced to pilot a giant, human-like robot named, Eva(s), to combat Angels. Angels have started to descend from the unknown, not the Angels with flashy, feathery wings which were depicted from the Bible. But Angels who are Alien-like life forms, in colossal, if not, massive sizes. Yes, Aliens named as Angels. As to why they’re named Angels, I don’t have a clue. Shinji doesn’t have a clue what these things are, neither was he briefed about it. Long story short, his * insert insult here * Father, Ikari Gendou, called him to go to the facility and pilot the thing himself, because the city is under attack by an Angel. Shinji, furious to hear the reason why he was called, didn’t want to pilot the Eva. That’s basically the gist of it. I don’t want to end up summarizing the first 5 episodes. Ok, a feedback on Evangelion’s story. First things first, I enjoyed most of the episodes; It’ll make you excited, laugh, scratch your head a little, cry a bit. Not until the later episodes, which will crack you up like a pistachio nut. Why? I’ve been asking that myself, even after finishing the show, I still do. Yes, it’s that mind-boggling. Some say, “Evangelion’s ending is the crappiest thing that ever happened in the history of Anime”. Surely, it was a shocker, and I didn’t expect that to happen, nor did anyone. I was bitch-slapped-surprised of what happened. Anyhow, Evangelion’s story is different from Anime(s) these days—wait, let me rephrase that, Evangelion’s a “LOT” different from Anime(s) these days. There are many reasons why it differs from the shows these days. The show didn’t rely on bouncing bewbs to attract viewers, just skin-tight-tights. Just kidding. It’s because of the unique (?) plot, unexpected ending, and mind-boggling theories about the perspective of life that’ll change your view about it instantaneously.\nArt: 8\nConsidering that the show came out when I was just a 4-year-old toddler, its ‘effing marvelous! Many shows didn’t have Evangelion’s art at that time. It’s impressive that they manage to make their art that good those days. But it can still rival some shows’ art these days. It might be the best drawn classic Anime show I have ever watched. \nCharacters: 9\nLet’s see, characters in Evangelion come’s in all shapes, colors, sizes, and personality! We have an, introvert (Ikari Shinji), an emotionless white-as-snow-kid (Ayanami Rei), an attention-whore (Asuka Langley), an itchy-whore (Misato), mom and daughter who’s obsessed with one guy with a family, and the most insensitive parent you’ll ever see, a womanizer, a war-geek, a class-representative-who-we-all-know-would-be-in-love-with-an-idiot-character, an idiot character, bunch of crazy-weird-ass Angels,  and finally, a Penguin named, Pen-Pen. Did you imagine all of those elements being blend together!? No, right? I mean, it’s like a freak-show of personalities! Anyhow, I liked every single character Evangelion had. They have their unique traits which separates them with the others, and compliments with the others. It’s a perfect blend.\nMusic: 9\nAlthough, there are only two music for the whole 26 episodes, I loved it. Cruel Angel Thesis has been a national anthem for me (stupid trivia: Katsura Hinagiku from Hayate no Gotoku! has a version of it, check it out if you like). Fly me to the moon is a classic adored by many, so it adds up to the greatness of the music (for me).\nEnjoyment: 8\nDid I enjoy Evangelion? Yes and maybe. Yes, because it was entertaining, brain-clenching, and maybe because I haven’t watched any shows for about a month or two. Nevertheless, it really entertained me, not that much, though. It’s not on my “must-watch” list, but definitely a good watch.\nOverall: 9\nA score of 8 is pretty feasible for Evangelion. Far from being perfect, and way far to be ugly, too. Thoughts like “Why am I even watching this?” and “What the crap is happening?” crossed my mind, not once, but a lot of times. Evangelion’s great, great at making the viewer feel what the characters are feeling. It’ll make you laugh, cry, and hate (this particular emotion ran through me throughout the series). I was up to the point of cursing someone in the show for being an insensitive bastard, I wanted to go inside the show and shoot that motherf***** right in the face. I was swayed emotionally by the show, it was a good thing, I think? I’ve felt how Ikari’s feeling at times, sure, it won’t doesn’t sound surreal—but I kind of understand him. Evangelion is way, waaaaaaaaaaay far off from all the “generic” shows out there. To tell you the truth, I was a lot disappointed about how the show ended. If you ask me, honestly, I think they made the ending like that just to make lots of alternate endings on it. I mean, with that kind of “world-self theory (a self-term I stupidly invented)”, they can make hundreds, if not, thousands of alternate stories about it. Not that I hate what they’ve done. It’s just that… It’s frustrating. I mean, all that 20+ epic episodes just for that ending? I can’t imagine the look on the faces of those who watched the series on free TV. It must have been really pissed them off. But hey, don’t let a nobody like me decide for you if it’s good or not. Try it out yourself. "},

Shinji is a character that has often been imitated in later series, but rarely with any success.\nShinji is often said to exhibit a kind of \"real teenage weirdness.\" His sexual desires, his frustrations, and his futile rebelliousness are all a huge part of what separates Shinji from shitty clones like Shuu from Guilty Crown.\nJust being a coward who occasionally rises to the occasion isn't enough to make a character interesting. Shinji is much more than that. This is what elevates Shinji, and the series as a whole, to the level of a masterpiece. \nWhat matters is\n          \n        that we can identify with him, even if we are not exactly like him. He seems human, and this is important, especially if you are trying to tell a story that is as much about human psychology as anything else. \nHis angst and mood swings seem organic, rather than merely convenient. This is essential if we are to \"believe\" the character has a life of its/his/her own. I cannot over-state the importance of this element. Series that do not succeed in this regard are doomed to mediocrity. \nWhen we start to see the strings behind the puppets, when the characters change artificially, that breaks immersion. We cease to believe in the character, and this makes us cease to believe in the WORLD of the character.\nI believe that, were it not for the success of Shinji as a protagonist, the show would be remembered primarily for Gainax's technical achievements. None of the other elements work without a character like Shinji in the middle of everything.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the world of Evangelion traps and haunts us only because Shinji is a highly-effective conduit between us and that world."},

So i think a beginner could watch it. I reckon anime in general is meant for older kids, since some of the the theme's and issues they deal with are pretty full on. Plus most anime have a bit of ecchi or what ever you call it. So then that leaves older children and adults left to watch NGE and they should be able to understand most of it (except epi 25/26).\nIf you watch \"the end of evangelion\" it explains visually what going on in epi 25/26. But i love the series ending, (after understanding what happens ) better.

Like i expected at that stage they would end the show like they save the world and everyone would be happy and shinji and his dad would be cool and so on.\nBut no. Then the 13th angel (Touji) comes around and like messes everything up. From there everything went downhill for the character's and i loved that. That every one had scars from the past and issues to deal with.\nNGE is so good because its like three shows in one. its a mecha. there's a element of slice of life. and the psychological in there as well.\nThe art work is done well. It's very watchable to this day.

And while, I see the point some people will make here in saying that the ending ruined it, you should in that case watch the movie ending and re-judge it.\nThat being said, I do not think it would be a great introduction to anime due to it being a little overwhelming for some people.\" - Nihilus_\n\"Am I one of the only people to actually like ep 25-6? I know it doesn't round things out plotwise, but I'd say it's a crucial part of the series, since it explores the reasoning behind Instrumentality, and the arguments against it.\nYes, End of Evangelion is a \"neater\" finish, but it would be incomplete without the insights from ep 25-6.\" - CriticalEye\n\"One of the first anime I started with so it's not too bad for beginners.\nI would say everyone needs to watch the NGE movies, not so much for death & rebirth since it's mostly a recap movie but definitely the End of Evangelion. Yeah, the last couple episodes were not true endings to the anime but at least the End of Evangelion gives somewhat a more \"proper\" ending.\nI'm looking forward to the new rebuild movies. At first, I thought they were going to be recap of the original series with HD and better animation but I think they're adding some new stuff so it could be interesting to see where it goes.\nA pretty okay series overall IMO, it's been such a long time since I've seen it but I still remember I was old enough to know what was going on and say WTF at some moments.\" - shoxk\n\"Great show spoiled by Shinji's emoness and a bullshit ending.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=41,   ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion is hard to put my finger on. It seems like any other mecha anime from the beginning, but gradually morphs into an exploration of character psychology after navigating several surprises and plot twists by the time it's all over. The show follows Shinji Ikari, a 14 year old boy mysteriously called in by his father to pilot an Evangelion unit. These giant robots are the world's only defense against Angels, gigantic creatures who destroyed half of the Earth's population 15 years ago.\nStory - 9/10\nTo break this down, the first two-thirds of Neon Genesis Evangelion is amazing. I found it to be as\n          \n        enticing as any anime has ever been. The plot unfolds in brilliant fashion and has the capability to keep viewers on the edge of their seat, impatiently waiting to see what happens next. The problem with the storytelling is that this method is how the show begins, continues, and even ends. What makes Evangelion fascinating is it's willingness to continuously dive deeper and deeper into itself, which naturally drives whoever watches to think and wonder constantly. The issue here is that by the time you're done watching, not many questions are answered, and if there's one thing difficult to pull off when any story ends, it's lack of resolution. It's like going on a scuba dive to see the wonders of the ocean, except you never come up for air. Regardless of this, the bulk of what you do get in Neon Genesis Evangelion is still undeniably interesting, and despite this being far from the most timeless anime around (in terms of quality, not impact, calm down people), it's still one of the most interesting universes I've seen thus far.\nAnimation - 8/10\nThere are often questionable moments where I wonder if the show fell into budget problems and got lazy on the animation. This shows during some unusually long holds on scenes (the elevator with Rei and Asuka and the end of episode 24 come to mind) that last well over a minute, as well as some cheap attempt at abstract animation that some will have you believe is artistic in the final episodes of the show. These same episodes also reuse lots of stuff from earlier in the show which again, seems to have no reason behind it beyond the lack of money.\nThese animation issues are few and far between however, and when Evangelion is going, it's going. While the character designs seem pretty basic, their suits, the mechas, angels, and pretty much anything you don't see in the real world in this show has a great design to it that stands out for all the right reasons. The action scenes were perfect for their time and although they aren't the greatest in this day and age, they still stand up very well. Is the animation dated? Yes. Is it bad? Not by any means.\nSound - 9/10\nThere's some very good voice acting here that really increases in both emotion and believability as the episode count goes up. This isn't to say it starts off bad but the quality of the acting in the latter half of Evangelion is noticeably great, while in the beginning there are a few deliveries here and there that seem unnatural. Misato and Asuka have particularly high quality performances behind them. Rei and Gendo on the other hand seem to come from the same school of cold and emotionless. Although this is part of each character's personality, it is on such a level where there isn't much to say about either one. I know everyone hates to hear Shinji scream, but it would be a lie to think that his wailing howl doesn't capture moments of horror perfectly. Many of the supporting roles and minor characters do sound pretty bad. Not a huge problem, but it sticks out like a sore thumb.\nThe soundtrack is stacked with memorable tunes that are even complimented with some fantastic use of classical music. While the OST does re-use a handful of tracks often, it does so in a manner that does nothing more than condition the viewer to know when things have just gone to hell or taken a lighthearted turn.\nCharacters - 8/10\nI think anyone reviewing this anime has to talk about Shinji Ikari, so I'm going to start with that. I don't hate Shinji. In fact, there really isn't much reason to hate Shinji. When this anime begins, everything we see Shinji go through as a 14 year old boy with a dead mother and one of the biggest pricks in the universe as his unloving father, combined with the traumatic experiences he has piloting his Eva, completely justifies how he acts. The problem people seem to have with Shinji is that he's a weak-willed, cowardly, whiny male lead. The flaw here isn't Shinji's character, it's the writing of Shinji's character. Nothing Shinji actually does bothers me, but the lack of development he has is a huge flaw for his character. So big that it makes me question why and how he ever came to be the lead of Evangelion to begin with.\nShinji has a huge conflict within himself from the first of this 26 episode journey to the very last. That is far, far too long of a time span to keep a character the same, especially when that character happens to whine, cry, and scream on a regular basis. Now, I didn't want Shinji to make a cliche transformation into a badass or even a consistently serious or confident guy, but I did want him to get over his weaknesses. When the time finally comes for Shinji to be at one with himself (this is literally in the last minute or two of the show and spends the last 38 minutes building up), I didn't even find it to be believable. It felt contradictory that he even had to try to change anything considering, despite all the hardship he goes through every other episode, he still gets the job done and is often the most capable pilot, despite being portrayed as the one who is least sure of himself. It felt like he should have made this transformation halfway into the show, not at the end.\nNo character seems to be as flawed in development as Shinji but nobody else really develops much either. The one pilot who does is Asuka, and her character was the one I found to be the most enjoyable and interesting of the main cast. Sadly, as soon as things get really spicy for her, it seems that she gets thrown to the side in a horrible manner. It's a shame too because I rarely find such a catty and obnoxious character like Asuka to have the potential to peel layers back with her past and persona, but that opportunity was completely missed. The other of the main three children, Rei Ayanami, seemed to have a constant mystery around her but ends up saying so little that I found myself indifferent to her. When the truth behind Rei is finally revealed it was interesting, but how Rei ever actually feels about anything is never really touched on, which is another shame. She could have been a truly great character but like Asuka, she's sort of tossed to the side in favor of being a plot device for Shinji to come to terms with himself.\nThe real stand-out of the cast is Misato Kusanagi. Misato isn't even one of the \"mains\" of the show, but instead a strong supporting character. It is Misato that's unwrapping all of the mystery at Nerv, Misato is the one helping the Eva pilots do their job correctly, Misato is barking the commands and Misato is the only one that really cares about them. I found myself loving Misato more and more as Evangelion progressed despite the fact that she doesn't seem like even a mildly interesting character when the show begins.\nThe supporting cast isn't too deep, but works well and I've heard people say they're more interesting than the kids. This is understandable since all of the plot twists and mystery of the show is driven by the adults and the pilots are the pawns in the bigger picture. Overall the characters, while not developing much, are likable, entertaining, and everyone seems to be able to pick one they really enjoy.\nOverall - 9/10\nNeon Genesis Evangelion was nothing if not ambitious, and it provides a balance of action and humor along with psychological and philosophical themes being explored that may lack polished execution, but draw thoughts in nonetheless. I was very into this anime from start to finish and even though the technical aspects of it pale in comparison to today's standards, Evangelion still has high quality moments and stands apart from everything else.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=36,   ["text"]="                          \n    Evangelion is often considered to be a must watch title, as it tried to push the boundaries of the medium during its run in the 90s. Helmed by Hideaki Anno, this Gainax series is known to polarize viewers due to its unconventional and controversial themes. Being a highly experimental series, is it worth your time to invest in the complicated web of Neon Genesis Evangelion? This will be a spoiler-free review.\nEvangelion starts off by introducing us to the main character Shinji, whose behavior is a large turn off for many. Shinji is thrust into the typical situation of most mechas, he is told he is\n          \n        the only one that can fight a nearly unstoppable group of monsters and save the world. He is told this by his estranged father, who is the head of the organization responsible for Earth's defense against the Angels, NERV. In other mecha anime we see the main character adjusting to this situation with a level head and become the savior of the human race, but Evangelion humanizes the character by showing him as a scared and depressed child who is clearly not qualified to pilot humanity's last hope. \nThis is what makes Evangelion so unique, it shows us the other side of typical scenarios, and provides a more human element by showing a vulnerable child who is just looking for some approval from those he loves. It still is difficult to watch Shinji's cowardice and his refusals to go near the Evas, but I think that I would have reacted in a similar way if I was strapped into the cockpit of some giant mech. The series starts off in a fairly linear fashion with the appearance of an Angel, the giant main antagonists of the series that are undefeatable by conventional means, and the heroes having to defeat the Angel before it makes its way to NERV headquarters. \nThe second main character introduced is the \"golden girl\" of Evangelion, Rei Ayanami, the mysterious and quiet blue haired girl. Rei is at first envied by Shinji due to her close relationship with his father, but the more and more we learn about Rei the stranger and less human like she seems. Rei is described as doll like on several questions, and this description fits her perfectly as she struggles with the concept of her own identity as well as her relationship with the head of NERV and Shinji's father, Gendo Ikari.\nThe last main introduced later in the story is Asuka Langely Sohryu, who is a child prodigy and the last main Eva pilot. She initially comes off as an arrogant, as she is extremely proud of her superior piloting skills and is extremely stubborn. Some of interactions with Shinji are the source of most of the comic relief of the series, but also reacts to his cowardice and her teasing of Shinji results in some of the actions that he takes. Her pride is one of her greatest strengths and her greatest flaw, as it allows her to charge into battle, but also serves as a cover for what's really going on inside her mind, and without her pride, Asuka is reduced to nothing. \nThe story of Evangelion is a complicated one, and it make take a rewatch or two as well as some discussion with others to try to fully understand what is going on in the series. Despite starting fairly straight forward with a simple plot of defeating the \"bad guys\" as they appear, the series showcases its great animation and the action scenes are a joy to watch. The fights are well choreographed and thought out, as brute strength isn't always needed to defeat the Angels and instead a well thought out and executed plan as well as a little luck is needed as well. The story is littered to references to religion, and some of there play an integral part of the story as well as the mystery behind Instrumentality and the Angels. All of the characters have their own personal agenda, as each is working to bend the will of Instrumentality to fit their own needs. The series has an intricate back story that is slowly progressed as the series moves on, and the history of Evangelion is fascinating and brings up a lot mysteries about what really is happening in the city of Tokyo 3. It is quite hard to follow and keep up with what is going on and why, which is a bit of a turn off for some, but it is rewarding to really think and come to your own conclusions of what is going going on in the world of Evangelion. \nThe ending of Evangelion spawned the term \"Gainax Ending\", and rightfully so the ending is a sharp departure from the action that was seen before it in favor of more unconventional ending that sees the characters try to conquer their inner conflict rather than offer a more definite real world conclusion. It's frustrating that most of the questions about what is happening outside isn't adequately explained, and leaves a lot of questions. In response to the lukewarm reception to the ending the End of Evangelion was released to offer a more ingrained interpretation to the ending, but is also pretty experimental itself and may not be able to satisfy or answer all the questions you have at the end of the series. \nEvangelion was a thought provoking anime that had some fantastic characters that really made the show, and had some superb animation for the time as well as a catchy opening that is considered one of the best in the industry. Although its difficult to understand and some times generally confusing, it is a truly unique work that really makes you think and was not afraid to push the boundaries of conventional thought. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=40,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion, i could basically summarise my review in one word, that word being 'mindfuck' but to many, its not AN anime, its THE anime, to others its a total mess lacking closure and explanations that leads into a clusterfuck of plot holes, but to me, Evangelion is a fantastic deconstruction of the mecha genre, and to do the saga of Evangelion justice, i'm going to review End of Evangelion as well as the series in ONE review, you ready? *takes a deep breath* Lets do this!\nThe setting:\nIn an alternate post-apocalyptic universe the world is under constant threat from 'Angels', mysterious beings that come\n          \n        basically out of nowhere with the intention of, as far as we know for most of the series, destroying the entirety of the human race.\nMuch like most good vs evil anime, Earth has created a top secret military station known as NERV to  construct giant robots known as Evangelions to combat the oncoming threats to prevent a cataclysmic event known as the Third Impact.\nAlso, an organisation known as SEELE (who exist unbeknownst to pretty much everyone in the series) were created to complete the Human Instrumentality Project to bring about the beginning of a new era in Human evolution.\nConfused yet? This is just the beginning...\nThe characters:\nLets start off with our main protagonist , Shinji Ikari. After having lost his mother before he could even remember and being heavily neglected by his father, Gendo Ikari, Shinji inevitably developed multiple psychological defects which take their toll as the show progressees, these issues include a guilt complex; where whenever something he is even remotely involved in goes wrong, he often blames himself for all of it regardless of his actual impact on the situation, and a case known as the Hedgehog's dilemma, where he is unable to become close to people in the fear that he might hurt those he is becoming close to, yet this is all explained alot better in episode 4.\nThese psychological issues often get the best of Shinji which results in him running away from his fears rather than embracing them.\nNext we have the fiery-tempered American, Asuka Langley Soryu who is the complete opposite to Shinji whilst suffering from pretty much the same anxieties.\nShe tends to be outspoken and outgoing to cover up the fact that she too lacks confidence but unlike Shinji, she refuses to admit she is weak minded as that would result in her confidence dropping towards the amount Shinji holds throughout the entire show, she needs to be complimented by pretty much everyone in order to stay mentally stable.\nAs the pilot of Eva unit-02 she tends to be completely kick-ass at everything Shinji basically sucks at and this results in amazing battle scenes with Angels with less of the whining Shinji tends to do in the same situation.\nShe too has had abandonment issues, having a messed up childhood which is explained as the series runs its course is the main reason she is the way she is.\nLast but not least we have Rei Ayanami, who sadly i cannot go into too much detail about as she possesses about 40% of the show's main plot points/twists and thus, going into detail about her would result in spoilers, all we know is she has some kind of personal connection to Shinji's father which is shown in the first episode.\nIts probably best that i dont describe ALL of the mentally unstable batch of characters this show has to offer, so i'll let you uncover the truth about them all one by one when you watch the show, and if you're a self respecting anime fan you probably should watch the show.\n\nArt:\nThe show was animated by Gainax in 1995 and was subject to very low budget as proven by the show's creator, Hideaki Anno, because of this low budget, the show began to slowly decline in animation quality until the last two episodes (dont worry, i'll talk about them in due time) throwing nudity and fanservice into the mix to cover up all the plot holes and animation mistakes that were becoming more and more obvious as the show progressed.\nA common way for animators to save money is to make all animation static and only animate the mouth, less movement results in lower costs, however Evangelion went even further by having characters mouths covered, off screen or facing away from the camera to further save money by not even animating mouth movement.\nThis is not to say that animation quality sucks all the way through, Gainax seem to have taken good care of the battle scenes which has resulted in well-choreographed fights that match or even exceed some mecha battle animation that has came out in the last 4 years or so, during these scenes, everything seems to move so fluidly and when the Evas run you can almost feel the weight of them yourself.\nSound:\nComing from a guy who has only seen the english dub of this show i must say its actually pretty good, although i understand that people may dislike it as for the most part of the first 5 episodes dialogue is kind of half-heartedly expressed and makes the impact of the scene more wishy-washy.\nDespite the first 5 episodes, the voice actors to eventually settle into their roles and end up doing a pretty damn decent job at it, a big shout out to Spike Spencer for capturing the realism of Shinji's situation to a T.\nThe soundtrack is nothing noteworthy, most of the music is played as background music during battles and for that reason, they work, other than that the OP, titled 'Thesis of a Cruel Angel', is something that gets a lot of love from alot of people as being possibly one of the greatest anime openings in existence, but despite Yoko Takahashi's beautiful voice accompanied by a fantasitc saxophone composition and brilliant animation to go with it (especially in the full version, you can chack it out yourself on YouTube) i wouldnt consider it the 'best', Soul Eater's 'Resonance' and 'Paper Moon', Higurashi's simply titled 'Main Theme' and Black Lagoon's 'Red Fraction'\nare, in my opinion , more notable.\n\nThe Ending:\nMuch like what i said in my Vampire Knight review, my belief is that the Ending is what decides my opinion on the show as a whole, and in the case of Evangelion, the ending is what stopped it from being undoubtedly my favourite anime of all time.\nIts no secret that as the series came to a close, production funds were so dry that the last two episodes were created by throwing a packet of Crayola at sheets of paper and releasing it on Japanese TV, and because of this, the show ended on a less than satisfactory note that upset and enraged a vast majority of fans.\nWhile i personally liked the ending as its the happiest ending you'll probably get from Evangelion (unless you read the manga, volume 14, chapter 96 i believe) its not hard to see why people hated it, the final episodes brought down the overall tone that episodes 1-24 had built up for it, yes i am talking about the infamous 'Congratulations' ending.\nAfter 2 years of an already depressed Hideaki Anno receiving both congratulatory letters and death threats, anno took more notice of the death threats and decided to remake episodes 25 and 26 into what would be the most controversial 87 minutes in anime history.\n\nEnd of Evangelion:\nAs a direct response to the unhappy fans who were given an unsatisfactory ending to an otherwise masterfully executed show, Anno and his team buckled up to recreate the ending, in 1997, End of Evangelion was released, and with it, came two of the most controversial scenes in anime.\nEnd of Evangelion is less of a film and more of two episodes combined, they're even divided up as such in the film itself, episodes 25 being called 'Air'/'Love is Destructive' and episode 26 named 'Yours sincerely'/'ONE MORE FINAL: I need you' and it pretty much picks up right where we left off assuming you bi-passed the last two episodes of the series.\nWe go into this movie with alot of questions, many of them being related to the plot holes present in the latter half of the series, but the most important question being, does this movie give the viewer a proper ending? Ehhhhh, alright, if you're the type of person that wants all the explanations tied up in a nice little bow and handed to you on a silver plate, then you're really not going to like it, though granted the movie (and the series for that matter) do make it incredibly difficult for you to understand whats going on.\nFor the most part, you'll be able to piece everything together if you're paying close attention, but some scenes, such as live action scenes from Japan as well as even some of the animated scenes that follow are cryptic, leaving you to decipher whatever meaning it has for yourself and opinions differ from one person to another.\nAnd then we come on to the infamous finale; the literal end to Evangelion, does it give you a satisfying ending? Perhaps it will, then again, perhaps not.\nI dont think the ending was intended to blow you away with its awesomeness, it was intentionally dull, gloomy and depressing and gave viewers the impression that the ending is what it is and thats that, though those who paid attention would know what's REALLY going on and would actually consider it a relatively 'happy' ending, atleast as happy as you can get for Evangelion.\nThe movie comes jam-packed with all the mecha action-y goodness Evangelion is popular for, but spins full swing into the deep psychological mindfuck conclusion that Evangelion is KNOWN for.\nAnd this brings me to the final verdict of Evangelion; If it wasn't for the existence of End of Evangelion then the series alone wouldn't have held a candle to the anime i currently consider it better than (those being When They Cry, Soul Eater, Bebop and Clannad) but because of a more thought out, better planned finale the movie gave us, i feel that Evangelion, whether it was intentional or not, is the cleverest and deepest anime i have ever seen.\n\"But what about the endings?\"\nYes, well, both endings are in many ways nonsensical, they demand that the viewer thinks about it over and over again in their head whether its days, months or even years until they come to their own logical conclusion, thanks to the movie, i can pretend that the last two episodes dont exist now that they have been corrected with a badass movie, and because of this, i give Neon Genesis Evangelion an overall rating of 10/10 and the recommendation to watch the living shit out of it as, although not all like it, its one of those anime where everyone should at least WATCH it\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=39,   ["text"]="                          \n    Okay, before I start this review I shall give a bit of background info as it had probably changed my viewing experience. \nThe first ever manga I've ever saw was evangelion. I didn't exactly read it but still, first exposure to manga/anime. Fast forward a couple of years and I remember that thing, not knowing the name. So I google searched what I remember and after a while, I found it. So it was something I was looking forward  to watching.\n>Story was fine..ish. It was okay, just a normal monster of the week type deal with mechs involved. But the thing that really made\n          \n        it interesting is the way the story is kind of set. It slowly turns from an action-y mech series to soemthing that feels more psychological. Which is why this story is interesting. But the latter part is confusing, which does prevent it from being a really good story.\n>Okay, this is an older-type of anime, so the art isn't like most so if you're one of those types who like gradient colors, this anime will slightly annoy you if you plan on watching it. But that doesn't mean the art style is bad, it's fairly good at least. If you can get past the old-style animation, which most usually do, the art is good.\n>Sound; this is probably where I'll have more difficulty explaining. The whole sound effects and dub was good. A really good dub in fact. But the music is a bit harder for me to decide. It does good during the whole fight scenes and usually the emotional ones, but it doesn't really shine through just the average normal scenes.\n>I know I may be getting some hate from this category but it's my opinion. I may change it after re watching it or something. Honestly, they aren't bad but they weren't good either. The main children were kinda cut-outs of tropes; the tsudere, the wimp, the calm one, the jock(sorta), and the sly one. They did do their roles really good actually. And the best part is how the characters are shown at various times, how they all are some how messed up in the head. \n>Enjoyment; I really liked it. It was me rediscovering an series that I probably would have never tried out if I didn't see it when I was younger and not even in to anime. I didn't care about the dated animation or even the moments where shinji was...shinji. But I enjoyed it, though the ending was really off. Either way it was a fine and not a waste of time.\n> Verdict; it's good. Okay to see if you decide to watch a mech series and then some. Nothing too over-the-top compared to today's standards in the music/art but still good none the less. \nBut that's my opinion and this is my first review, so feel free to Caps at me if you feel like I was totally wrong in my review.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=39,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Well, here we are. The anime industry's magnum opus, or one of them, at the very least. From what I understand, no one who watches this show is on the fence about it: you'll either love it, or you'll hate it. Before I sing my thousand praises for this lovely thing, there are a few things you need to be informed about before embarking on your mech future journey thing.\nWithout spoiling anything, you should know before going into this series that the original two episodes that aired as \"the ending\" are not an ending. They have absolutely nothing to do with the ending, and quite\n          \n        frankly it's a little generous to say they're closely related to the show itself. Make note: you can skip the psychological trip that is the original episodes 25 and 26, and move right on to the movie that was created to replace them ( I have yet to watch it).\nSecondly, as production continued, the animation studio behind Neon Genesis eventually became a little short on cash. What resulted from this was: 1) The crap final two episodes, and 2) extremely and unnecessarily long still shots wherein the characters do absolutely nothing, accompanied by random background noise. Most of the flaws I was able to find in the show itself stemmed from this dip in production value, but personally I didn't find them to be so jarring I could no longer enjoy the series.\nEveryone who likes this show has their reasons, and I'm sure we can all agree that, symbolism etc. aside, Neon Genesis Evangelion is just a fun time to watch. It's a breath of fresh air when juxtaposed to the sub-par contemporary anime you've watched consecutively for months on end. The characters feel real: they rarely ever exemplify one specific character trait without stepping out of what is expected of said trait. Futhermore, they're all the most damaged fictional beings I've seen in a long while, and only seem more irreparable the closer you become with them. These fictional characters all interact in the most mesmerizing ways, and all I wanted to do was jump into their universe and join them.\n The action is always fast, the art style is beautiful, and the voice acting for the English dub is fabulous. As the complex and intricate plot begins to unfold, you're often left with a thousand more questions than answers. That in itself can be frustrating for some, but it gave me incentive to watch ten episodes in a row and still want more.\nSomething has to be said for the maturity of this show as well, and by that I'm not referring to the violence or sexual themes. Evangelion heavily subscribes to the, \"show don't tell\" rule, which, to be quite honest, bumped it up to my top five after the first episode alone. It lets you think about its content without spelling it out for you, and it makes masterful use of the animated medium to place certain things in plain sight without grabbing you by the ears and forcing you to look in that direction. To give a simplified example, there is once instance where a character has sustained an injury, and the audience is expected to figure out what that is without being told it's there, if that makes sense. Another thing I have to give the director props for is knowing when to use music and when not to, along with the unique soundtrack. This is just further proof that Neon Genesis expects you to be able to figure things out for yourself, as it rarely ever plays an obviously emotional song to tell you what you should be feeling at any given moment. \nWhat I found most riveting was the show's use of symbolism. Yes, there is the obvious aesthetic borrowing from various religious systems, but there is also a multitude of metaphors subtle enough that you wouldn't notice them unless you paused during or after the episode and gave the whole thing some consideration. Cracked glasses, for example, representing a character losing sight of what is important, or a distorted viewpoint, or maybe even something entirely different! There is endless material for discussions comparing the relationship between creator and created being, parent and child. This may be my bias as a literature major shining through, but I feel like a work of art has done its purpose if it has either provoked thought or invoked emotion in its audience. \nThat being said, the ending of this show did not ruin my regard for the anime in its entirety. I'm sure I'll have the same opinion once I finish the film (or is it two films?) that were created to rectify the studio's original mistakes. Chances are that if you're reading this you've already watched it, but if you haven't, I'd highly, highly recommend this one.\n        "},

The story centers on Shinji, a teenage boy who is recruited by the shadowy organization\n          \n        NERV to pilot a giant bio-machine called an Evangelion in combat against monstrous beings known as Angels.\nThe synopsis was not something that swept me of my feet even though it had badass mechas fighting against it.The characters did\nCharacters-10\nI wished I could rate this higher than 10.I know I'm probably of the lesser crowd,when I say SHINJI is one of the best written characters of all time.Yes,he was a bitch.Yes,he was annoying.Yes,he was a pussy.But ask yourself:What would you have done if you were in his place?The guy had no military training,lived a lonely life,his father abandoned him,no motherly love and yet he wanted to prove to everyone that he is capable of something.In one of the episodes you can see how happy he was when his father appreciated him.He longed for that.I can understand why people don't like his character,but I've never seen such a realistic potrayal of any character.\nAs of other side characters,they were just as good as Shinji.Each had their own issues and the show managed to give brilliant characterisation to each one of them.It's unlike any other shows I've seen.\nFuck GENDO\nAnimation-6\nGainax did a pretty good job for the art and animation,even though they ran out of budget buy the end of the series and had to use paper clippings in the final episode which really worked well.I had no major issues with the animation.\nSound-8\nThat opening song!! That fricking opening song is truly a gem.As of the other OSTs they were great as well\nEnjoyment-10\nI have seen many threads where people say that the series get good around episode 8-10,but I felt the series was brilliant right of the bat.As the show gets deeper,the show becomes more psychological.You feel for the characters.You connect with them.Indeed,the final 2 episodes make you want to kill someone,but thankfully the End Of Evangelion movie make up for it.It manages to cover most of the plot holes and has a better ending than the series\nFinal Thoughts:\nEVA isn't an anime,it's an experience.I've never felt so depressed while watching an anime.The series will tear your heart apart and grind it into pieces.\nIt's 2015.You know what time it is:Get in the fucking robot,SHINJI\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=30,   ["text"]="                          \n    More than meets the eye is the first thing that pops to mind if someone mentions aliens referred as Angels and the human piloted machines known as Evangelion that fight them. There is a lot of good and a lot of not so good things to say about this series and some of it does come down to perspective and how you think about the scenario, but there are some points of interest that everyone should take into account.\nThe very first episode gives perhaps the worst impression on what the actual objective of the series is.\nAn outside force is threading earth and everything living and\n          \n        only a selected few are able to stand up against them is the basic premise that you will get from the series and yes it does seems like a narrow setting and to a certain degree it is. However this battling against the unknown and figuring out where the Angels are coming from and why are they attacking earth is not where the series focuses on, which for a mecha anime for the time is pretty rare.\nYou need to step down a level and take a better look at the pilots. Our main protagonist Shiniji Ikari, who is 14 years old and due to his fathers order who is in charge of the Evangelion project selects him as the \"Third Child\" to pilot the EVA as they refer to the robots. Shiniji is not fond of his father when he abandoned him as a younger child and even hates him for doing so as anyone would. Shiniji grows to be afraid of being loved because of the fear of being left alone like his father did and has a difficult time socializing. This lack of trust in others leads to a lack of confidence and self doubt in questioning his purpose in life and whether his only redeeming factor is piloting the EVA and after that will he become useless.\nAsuka Langsley Soryu is the \"Second Child\" of five appearing in the show as they call the children who are chosen as the pilots for the EVA's. Asuka has a very unfortunate past where her mother has a mental illness and suffering in such a way that she thinks a doll is her daughter as her real child looks behind the glass and looks at her. Despite the fact that her mother ignores Asuka she comes to see her mother, but one day she finds her mother hanged from the ceiling. Asuka had to live without her mother's affection and be replaced by a lifeless doll, she didn't have a father and she had no one that paid any attention to her so she ended up being lonely and unloved. she hid her feelings and turned her loneliness into arrogance and fake confidence and aimed to be the center of attention she never had.\nThe last Child in the main cast and also the first one to be chosen Rei Ayanami comes across as a shell of a human who seems to only reply when necessary and not be concerned about herself even in the most dangerous situations. Her face, her appearance and expressions are as pale as snow. It almost feels like she has given up on life and only lives for the orders she receives and if she ends up dying she is fine with it. Her identity is almost as if she didn't have one, eventually it comes clearer as to why she is the way she is, but she starts to question her own existence as a result.\nCharacters aside, while they are a big focus in the series there are more elements than that, and these elements make the show feel less polished. The plot itself does leave questions unanswered and questions that only lead to more questions, for that in the respective of story telling leaves a bit of a unhappy feeling, but it does remain interesting and rarely makes you think that a scene was unnecessary. Symbolism occurs in the show quite often and it leaves the viewer to decide what to make of it, and since there may not be a real answer to them it makes the story more difficult to follow.\nAs for the animation style and sound department it is nothing out of the unusual, they serve their purpose for dramatic effects and makes the scenes have a better flow. Quality of the animation varies from time to time, but the battle scenes usually are good looking. Not mind blowing, but you could certainly do a lot worse. As for the opening and ending songs I think they fit, and especially the opening is memorable.\nThe series has its obvious short comings, however that doesn't mean that those faults make the things that this series does fantastically faulty as well. The action is a good way to make you feel that the danger is real, but what is fighting against the danger are children who can at any moment die. The characters are made extremely well and as you watch and see the development in their life and even mental state. It gives very frightening food for thought as to if it's right to make the children go through such a thing and this becomes the strongest element in the show.\n\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=38,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I was a little late getting on the EVA train. About sixteen years late. See, what happened was, I was sitting in my Japanese class and we're totally geeking out about mech anime while we wait for sensei to arrive. I end up admitting that I hadn't ever seen EVA before, and so this guy sitting next to me basically explains how my life has been incomplete due to the gap left by a lack of Evangelion. I initially wrote this off as a simple overstatement, but I decided to sit down and watch.\nHe couldn't have been more correct.\nNow, before watching, I had had some\n          \n        previous exposure to this series. I knew how it ended, or, perhaps, how it didn't end. I mean, how could anyone have gone this long without knowing about that whole \"Congratulations\" scene. But I digress.\nStory: 10\nIn constructing Evangelion, Hideaki Anno created a bizarre and multilayered universe, which, on the surface, doesn't look too terribly different from our own. Really all that's different is the whole angel thing (and that's if you aren't including the setting in all of this). When you first get into it, you make all kinds of fundamental assumptions about the EvaVerse, the most important one being the origin of species. I'm not going to spoil it, but let me just say that no matter how you think that humanity came about, it ain't got nothing on EVA's background. On top of the worldbuilding aspect, there's plenty of fun to be had following the twists and turns of Shinji's adventures in the Evangelion, although that last bit may have painted a picture of a typical shounen action series, which EVA decidedly is not. No, Evangelion starts off somewhat cheerful (well, as cheerful as an anime set in post-apocalyptic Japan can get) and grows progressively darker from there. I don't remember at which exact moment I realized \"holy f*ck this got really dark,\" but it was probably somewhere between episodes 16 and 18. Overall, the story is so complex, it's impossible to understand it after just one run-through, to the extent that there is an entire wiki dedicated to in-depth analysis of this series.\nArt: 8\nWhile I would not go as far as to call the art of the series beautiful, I definitely liked it. I really like the designs for the \"monsters,\" a term I'm using somewhat generally to refer to both the angels and the EVAs. First of all, the angels do not look like your typical Judeo-Christian conception of what an angel looks like. They aren't pretty, they don't have halos, (except some of them do and they all do in the Rebuild movies) they don't play harps, and they certainly aren't messengers of any god that I'd like to meet. They look like how many angels in the Bible are described. For instance, the sixteenth angel, Armisael resembles the angels, called Thrones, described in the book of Ezekiel as \"Wheels within wheels.\" The EVAs, on the other hand, are much more humanoid in appearance, except for certain aspects of their design, meant to invoke demonic imagery. In their preliminary design stages, they even had horns, playing them counter to the \"heavenly\" aspect of the Angels. Hell, EVA Unit 01 is referred to as the Beast while in Berserker mode, so it's not even that much of a stretch.\nAs far as character design goes, I definitely liked the way they look. I feel like the best-designed character would be Gendou, both in appearance and as far as his costume design goes. Every bit of him just exudes an air of malicious secrecy, telling us that he knows something that we don't, and probably never will.\nSound: 7\nThe sound design and music was actually incredibly good. However the sound quality is quite lacking. Now, I gave it some leeway due to it being more than a decade and a half old, however I'm taking a somewhat holistic approach to this, embracing both the English dub and the original Japanese. The Japanese is nearly perfect. There are a few hiccups with the voice acting, but that's to be expected, all things considered. It's the English voice cast that brings the sound quality down for me. They just didn't seem to match in a few ways, the most glaring one being that the sound quality of the voice acting was leaps and bounds better than the background music and sound effects. However, there is one thing that saves it, and that is the performance of the voice cast. Spike Spencer as Shinji, Tristan MacAvery as Gendou, Allison Keith as Misato, and Tiffany Grant as Asuka stand out to me in particular, among a cast of scenery chewers and character actors.\nCharacter: 9\nI don't like Shinji. But then again, we're not really *supposed* to like Shinji. He is pretty much universally referred to as the whiniest protagonist in all of anime. He is entirely passive, doing only what other people tell him to do, especially when it's something that he doesn't want to, like piloting the EVA. But, as a character, I really like Shinji. He has realistic wants and fears. He has a motivation.\nAsuka is not a well-adjusted individual, but in the world of EVA pilots, being screwed up in the head is pretty much a requirement for the position. She's clearly got daddy (mommy?) issues and is, once again, an interesting character with a deep background and realistic desires.\nI think that it's unfortunate what's happened to Rei. When this was made, the idea of a short, blue-haired, emotionless girl character was rare, if not original. She's well-constructed, overall, however I just can't look past the way that her character has been copied to death, and occasionally even being done better than the original. It's nothing personal, Ayanami. I've just seen it all before. I'd probably have a different perspective if it were 1996 and I still hadn't watched, like, any other anime, but it's not. It's 2014 and the waters have already been poisoned.\nI really like Gendou. I don't think that can be overstated at all. He's like what you get if Machiavelli decided to have a kid and also human instrumentality second impact giant fighting robots desu. He's sort of set up to be a bit of a minor villain, and, well, once the threat of the angels is dealt with (as if there was any doubt that it wouldn't be) he gladly steps toward that role, even if it is eventually filled by the other shadowy government organization. He also has some really interesting relationships with other characters. His nurturing relationship with Rei is possibly the polar opposite of the way he treats Shinji. There's just so much going on inside that calculating head of his.\nRitsuko is kinda screwed up, but then, if you had to deal with the stuff she's had to go through, so would you. I like her relationship with her late mother, the way that, even though she sees herself as the opposite of her mother, she has stepped in to essentially fill that role. Even her relationship with Gendou is exactly the same as the one her mother had with him.\nMisato hides her pain behind a thick barrier of booze and duty. Fifteen years after her father's death in the Second Impact, she is still reeling from the loss. She refuses to reach out to anyone, as she fears that she might get hurt. She took a chance in taking Shinji in, and that led to some great times for the both of them (and also Asuka once she joins the party).\nEnjoyment: 10\nI liked it a lot. Especially when it got dark. It was fun. As this is a qualitative measurement, there's not much else to say.\nOverall: 10\nThis anime is not for everyone. But if you like giant mech battles, Christian imagery, and Immanuel Kant, then this is the anime for you. Also, if you enjoy being congratulated. That's definitely an added bonus."},

NOTHING can be perfect in THIS world, like perfect map can't be perfect because it's so complete and hard to use (if you're an IB student probably you know what i mean). AND SO author, (i believe) tells us, that yes, we can't choose our parents, or the situation and the era we are born in, but we can change our present an, yes we make mistakes, but who doesn't, that's nothing to be upset of, just stand again and face whatever you have to face. \"miracles aren't something that just happen, they're something that people make happen.\" \"if you want the real happiness you've got to find that by yourself, not waiting someone to give it to you.\" \" remember, that anywhere can be paradise as long as you have the will to live.\" and for the final \"to all children CONGRATULATIONS!\" \nAs Jostein Gaarder sad, life is a lottery where every ticket's owner is a winner and you, who are reading  this book is one of those winners, lucky one! \nthis is my understanding of NGE and this is the reason why i love it so much... hope you'll enjoy this  masterpiece too..\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=38,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    *This will be a spoiler free review*\nWhen I first started watching NGE, I didn't know what to expect. It starts off like your typical mecha anime, but it soon deviates into a completely different beast, and that's why I love it so much. \nEvery major character in the show has plot relevance. The thing I liked the most is how the major characters either had some sort of mental issue or an intention that conflicted with other intentions, so it was a crazy anime all around. It starts off very simple, but like I just said, it soon deviates into a crazy, psychological mess due\n          \n        to all the mixed intentions and mental issues.\nThe whole \"not your typical mecha anime\" thing is very true too. The EVA's, the giant robots Shinji, Rei and Asuka pilot are one of the most interesting aspects of the show. The EVA's have an amazing backstory too. Watch it for yourself and see how it all plays out.\nThe music is something I have a soft spot for too. From my favorite track \"The Beast II\" to \"Ode to Joy\", the music just makes those \"what the hell, that's insane!\" moments even better! The music complements the series in such a great way, it's incredible. \nThe animation is dated, yes, but keep in mind that it came out in 1995, so that's excusable. It's not horrible, but it does show. Hey, the Rebuild movies have much better animation so that's one of the many pluses the Rebuild bring to the table. (Rebuilds are a good watch after NGE)\nThe plot is VERY confusing though. There is so much going on and so much terms are thrown at you that it becomes so much to contain that it's impossible to grasp all in one go. It is very well done though. Even one of the characters has a very interesting backstory. Like the EVA point I brought up, watch it and see.\nSo, if you're a fan of great action and very plot heavy animes, then NGE is for you. Overall, I love this series. Everything was so well done, it's no wonder it's classic among anime. Just prepared to be very confused. I highly enjoyed this show, and it is my favorite anime of all time. Also, watch \"The End of Evangelion\" after the series, or right after episode 24 then finish the TV series. You'll thank me later.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=37,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    As a complete '10' show, NGE brilliantly drives the watcher into the world of kids protecting the world from the destruction... Or, is that so? \nIF AFTER WATCHING YOU THINK THAT THE PLOT IS NOT FINISHED AND THE SERIES WAS ABOUT MECHAS, THEN WATCH IT AGAIN. AND AGAIN. AND AGAIN. Don't give an opinion until you REALLY get what was going on.\nAnd as a major thing I've noticed is the fact, that the ending in EoE is just a cinematized and actionized (are those two words? I'm not sure) for sake of enjoyability, while 25&26 EP (widely regarded as gibberish etc.) drive the person into\n          \n        the Shinji's psychic and goes widely psychedelic, still being easy to understand if the person wants to understand it, on a larger sense than robots and saving the world, it is not about saving the planet in the end...\nThe series combines VERY many genres, ranging from ecchi through comedy to action (lots of those).\nThere's nothing to say about the characters, since those were VERY widely discussed and for me they're great portrayals of broken kids, and as such (it was a concept after all) the makers did a great job: they're really broken, it is very widely expressed and shown. Shinji is not emo, he's just a guy in his 14s (or at least it seems like that) who is completely lost.\nAsuka is a VERY tsundere person, but, different from many series, it's firmly anchored in her story. Rei is just Rei, silent and not open at all, well, none character is. The rest of the crew goes pretty well, hell, they're made as good as the main chars.\nWhat I loved was the music, placing the classical music in various places was a really good decision and ruled a big time. OP and ED fit my taste and I loved them.\nAlso, art was great - maybe the Angles were kinda laughable, but first it was a decision which could be related to the real sense of the series and secondly the fights were done with great precision - especially all the blood splatters'n'shit.\nThe last two EPs, which are considered the ones which hadn't gotten enough budget have benefited from it, actually - they're dark and empty, emphasizing the climate.\nIn conclusion I'd like to say that I can recommend this series to any person that deserves a lot from a series, not just typical fights, ecchi or comedy. It has got sense, an idea, atmosphere and a wonderful plot. \nCheck it yourself!\n        "},

Then it just threw you in the bath full of water and you woke up wet all over with a face wondering WTF happened? The story is inconsistent, but interesting. \nStory development: Until episode 14 it was developing very good and it was asking for some dramatic change, but it went bazzurk and did something that nobody could expect and failed a bit. Not like after episode 14 the anime becomes bad its just worse then it was.\nArt: It had too good art for that time ( It first aired in 1995). Had\n          \n        great mecha fights and overall the art is great, but I have to say that one scene in this anime was seriously annoying me. It was the one were Asuka and Rei were driving in the lift and there was no movement or talking for like 40 seconds , I think.\nSound: Good stuff. I loved the beethoven music in one episode and the opening sounded very good too.\nCharacter: Yeah characters in this anime are pretty screwed up. It's hard to say if they are good that way or bad that way. Shinji to me seemed like an interesting protagonist who isn't like the normal protagonists who are typically brave, strong willed, and never give up no matter what. Then again Shinji is kinda too much cowardly and weak, has no desires or ambitions for being even similiar to somebody real, which will definetly annoy some people.\nAsuka seemed like an interesting person at start, but somehow she became crazy and weird for no apparent reason. Rei is a robot( well she seems so like 95% of the time).\nCharacter development: Was there any? Only for Shinji I think and I would hardly call it a development. Can't say how he developed, but let's just say that for me it was disapointing.\nOther characters seem to regress and not to develop.\nEnjoyment: I liked watching evangelion, not because it was a masterpiece ( in some ways it is, but in some it isn't a masterpiece), but because it was a great and entertaining watch. I wouldn't put this anime in my favorites anime list, but it would go right next after my 10 favorite animes and I seriously am glad that I watched this anime, because it widened my sight on what anime can really be.\nOverall: Watch this anime not because of of it's mecha, or psychological aspect, but because there isn't any other anime quite like this one. It is a rare pearl in the anime world that differs from all other animes and it might not be the best anime out there, but it is well worth your time to watch it to know what Evangelion really is all about."},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=37,   ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion, a show that has polarized audiences for almost 20 years. This show is not for everyone. Having said that, should everyone watch it? Absolutely.\nNGE has endured through the years, retaining its reputation as an anime classic, despite its highly controversial artistic choices. Why? Because it's different. Evangelion took conventional aspects of the mecha genre and tore them to pieces. People didn't know what to make of it in 1996 and now, in 2014, people still don't know what to make of it.\nThe show begins normally enough, with the now-iconic 14-year-old Shinji Ikari being called on by his estranged father to pilot a\n          \n        giant robot, Evangelion Unit 01, to combat huge beings known as Angels in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo. He meets two more Eva pilots, Asuka Langley Soryu and Rei Ayanami, and for the first half of the show the story is nothing out of the ordinary, featuring battles against Angels in an almost formulaic fashion. As the second half begins, the show slowly begins to take a more abstract approach, featuring complex sequences and psychoanalysis of central characters. Hidden conspiracies somewhat come to light and dark secrets are somewhat revealed.\nAnd that is exactly why many viewers find NGE to be so frustrating. It only SOMEWHAT gives us answers to the million questions we're asking. Just when it seems that it's going to give us answers, it instead introduces more murky plot elements that again, are never made clear. Obviously this is done intentionally but it's beyond my grasp how the audiences of the '90s were supposed to be able to piece together the events of NGE to form some comprehensible explanation. I, for one, have not, and I'm on the verge of resigning to accepting that whatever Evangelion is really trying to say, it is far beyond my understanding.\nAs far as characters go, NGE just about manages to hit this one on the head. The main characters are not just developed, they are ruthlessly psychoanalyzed and their outer facades are completely torn to shreds. They are much more than just kids. Shinji's anxiety is explored and tested to the limit as he struggles with the burden of piloting an Eva and his almost nonexistent relationship with his father. Rei doesn't reveal much in terms of emotions but by the show's conclusion it's clear that she has zero self-worth and is willing to comply with any orders not because of courage or loyalty, but because she believes herself to be expendable. But the most dynamic character analysis is definitely Asuka's. She's shown to be made of much more than just overblown pride, and insights into her changing mental state paint a portrait of a fragile, scarred girl who is teetering on the verge of collapse. In a way, NGE focuses more on its central characters than it does on its overall plot. Is this a strength or a flaw? That depends on the viewer.\nAs far as the ending is concerned, I'm not going to claim I understood it or try to explain it. The final two episodes of Evangelion are perhaps the most controversial topic in anime history. Although it provides an ultimate psychoanalysis of the central characters, the ending of NGE blatantly fails to provide any basic level of plot resolution whatsoever. Various questions about events and plot elements that have been hanging over the viewer's head are thrown out the window in favor of experimental, artsy sequences that made me feel like I was watching The Tree of Life. Maybe it had a deep artistic purpose that I completely missed. But to me, the ending of NGE felt like a cop out, as if the plot had become so heavy and overloaded that it was simply too much to provide a coherent conclusion.\nSo, why did I say that everyone should watch this show? Because it's thought-provoking and everyone will view it differently. To me, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a bold show that resolves its characters brilliantly but gets weighed down by a bloated and overly ambitious plotline, as well as a conclusion that is perhaps too experimental for its own good and, to me, was a misfire. NGE certainly isn't awful, but there are way too many things preventing it from being great.\n        "},

What makes the Evas different from other mecha is: they have a nearly impenetrable barrier, the AT Field, only certain youths can pilot them, the Evas themselves do major damage to the city while defending it, and they are not so easy to control; you have to synchronize with them. The purpose of the Evangelion (Eva\n          \n        for short) is to defend the fortress-like city of Tokyo-3 (and all of mankind, really) from seemingly extraterrestrial beings with destructive abilities, called the Angels. \nART: The series was made in 1995, thus everything it is hand-drawn; and I must say, the animation is exceptional. Everything from the characters to the subtle things in the background is drawn well.\nSOUND: The voice acting is excellent. The growls and roars from the Evas and Angels are breathtaking. In addition, the use of classical music always sounds appropriate and is enjoyable to listen to.\nCHARACTERS: The character development is one of the reasons why NGE is such a good series. Many of the characters are depressed; they don't just do their job and fight the Angels mindlessly. They also have regrets and get angry like normal people would if they had to do such a thing. You have an idea of what almost all the characters have went through in their life (the personnel who sit at the computers are really the only ones who you know little about).\nENJOYMENT: The epic battles against the Angels are extremely thrilling. The times when Shinji \"runs away\" are interesting, as you try and figure out exactly what he's thinking. The parts where Misato drinks beer early in the morning and yells \"yeehaaa!\"  are hilarious.\nOVERALL: If there is any serious worthy if the title \"masterpiece\", it's NGE. Anno Hideaki \"burned his soul\" into NGE; the series basically tells his entire life (or at least his battle with depression) through the use of visually craft, symbolism, metaphors. This isn't a series you can analyze by watching just once. However, even if you view it superficially, it is still entertaining. \n"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=36,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    So, Neon Genesis Evangelion. It, in my opinion, might be one of the most well known 90's anime out there (besides sailor moon, i guess). Although it is, admittedly, a little overrated, confusing, and pretentious, it is an anime that I think everyone should watch. 3 Reasons why.\n1. Wonderfully flawed characters.The male protag, Shinji, is a sniveling wimp, but in all due reason. His father is a massive prick and his mother is dead. He has few friends and is not very physically or mentally strong.In a world of tough guys like the heros in Robotech or Gundam, Shinji is a welcome sight.\n2. The Soundtrack.\n          \n        Everyone has heard Cruel Angel's Thesis. Evangelion gave us one of the most iconic anime openings, ever. Fly Me to the Moon, the outro song, is a classy version of Sinatra's old song. Other memorable tracks include Both of You, Dance Like You Want To Win, Angel Attacks And Komm, Susser Tod. \n3. The plot. NGE's plot is riddled with all sorts of symbolism, psychology and philosophy and where most animes would collapse under the pretentiousness, Hideaki Anno makes it shine through. Although many people complain about how confusing it is, just don't think about it. Just watch it and form your own ideas and theories. It only gets weird after episode 16.\nJust remember: \" I mustn't run away.\" Evangelion is too good to run away from.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=36,   ["text"]="                          \n    One series that needs no introduction in anime fandom is \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" (or just \" Evangelion\" for short). Infamous, influential and controversial, it's probably the most well known anime equivalent of marmite, with opinions on it being extremely polarised - it's usually considered either as a brilliant masterpiece or a pretentious piece of crap. As for which side of the fence I'm on, the answer is neither. I'm straddling it, and I have to say it's quite uncomfortable having a piece of fence stuck up my arse, but I'm digressing...\nAt the time of this writing, I've watched \"Evangelion\" twice. First time round, I liked\n          \n        it, but also thought it was overrated. Having watched it again 5 or 6 years later after hearing/reading so much about it, I've come to appreciate - to some extent - what made it such a big series, even if I don't think of it as God's gift to anime.\nRight from the start, \"Evangelion\" showed intent to distinguish itself among other mechas. Even discounting the uncharismatic protagonist and the focus on his psychological problems (all of which I'll get to later), there are things that stuck out. For example, piloting a mecha in \"Evangelion\" is not shown as a nice experience. The Eva units have barely been tested in real battle when they get introduced at the beginning of the series, and as such, they're pretty unreliable and experimental. And to pilot the Evas, the pilots have to almost become a part of them, and this has some less than ideal consequences: the pilot experience painful feedback when their Eva is damaged, and also their mental condition can severely impact the performance of the Eva due to its synchronisation mechanism. The mecha battles themselves can be gruesome; there's a kind of animalistic brutality about them. The Evas are at least semi-biological in nature, as are some of their enemies, so instead of the usual clashing of cold, unfeeling lumps of giant metal, these battles often feel more akin to mighty beasts ferociously tearing into one another.\nBut most of this is just confetti, because the real meat of \"Evangelion\" is found in its collection of dysfunctional characters.\nThe first few episodes mostly centre on the protagonist Shinji , a character notorious for his incessant whining. He may not be my favourite character ever, but I do find him to be a believable character for the most part, especially his love-hate relationship with his dad, and his reluctance to pilot his Eva . After all, he's still a child, and as much as mecha piloting is generally seen as a glorious job in anime, mechas are just tools for destruction, and in a more sombre view it's not unreasonable to see adults not being able to stomach all the fighting and killing, let alone children. Factor in also the aforementioned hardships involved in being an Eva pilot and also Shinji's upbringing (or rather lack of), his actions are understandable - he may be a wuss in anime terms, but the way the anime explores his problems in the first few episodes makes it hard to blame him.\nAfter getting off to a good start though, the series couldn't maintain its quality. One of the reasons is its descent into a lame monster-of-the-week format. While these episodes aren't terrible, they're kinda generic, and are often filled with rather convenient or contrived plot points (if, in one episode, an Eva isn't equipped to deal with a certain situation, you can be sure that situation will arise). This is especially disappointing considering how the series started off so ambitiously. Another problem is the other mecha pilots. I know the series deliberately hand-picked a cast of characters that are less than normal, but out of the show's famously abnormal central trio of Shinji, Asuka and Rei, only Shinji's characterisation can be considered good. And as the monster-of-the-week format kicked in with full force, the focus shifted from Shinji onto this harem of his, and a good change it is not. Asuka is too one-dimensionally loud and annoying, while Rei is too one-dimensionally lifeless and wooden, not to mention the latter's nauseatingly obedient personality smacks of pandering (it's no coincidence that her character is so popular). Yes, I know there are more to them, but their dominant personality traits feel artificial and overblown to the extent that they drown out all other aspects of their characters.\nAsuka's appearance was particularly bad for the show, as not only was her own characterisation poor, she also induces Shinji to become strangely chirpy and full of indignant banter. Even in the earlier part of the series, the comedy (epitomised by the random penguin,) often seemed out of place, but I felt it especially keenly here during the exchanges between Asuka and Shinji. Thanks to Asuka and Rei, this part of the show produced some of the most memorably bad scenes in the series, including a contrived kissing scene and an atrocious \"embarrassing accident\" scene that could have been recycled from any number of lowly harems. This smattering of cliches and random humour feels detrimental and almost insulting to the darker, more serious portions of the show.\nThankfully, it doesn't last for too long, and \"Evangelion\" soon goes back to what it does best - the exploration of its fucked up characters. It's not just the main characters who have a few screws loose; hardly any of the supporting characters can be considered mentally healthy. Misato's psychological scars belies her often girlish behaviour (a bit like Asuka in that respect, but not quite as bad), and even the seemingly calm and rational Ritsuko has mental baggage stashed away in the proverbial closet of her mind. And that's not even mentioning Gendo who, with his unique brand of fatherly love, is probably the most screwed up of them all. Most of the important side characters are well fleshed out, with the show usually dedicating at least an episode or two to explore each of their problems.\nAs the show continued, it got darker; more importantly, it got better. But while the dubious mental state of the characters got a thorough examination, the same cannot be said for the underlying plot. Although there's a grand sense of complexity about it, so many important details are glazed over that the narrative bordered on incoherent at times. The show seems more interested in raising questions, cultivating them like watermelons, than actually harvesting them and giving out some answers. But given that the creator of the show himself, Anno Hideaki, apparently admittedly that they were making it up as they went along, this is perhaps not surprising.\nWith dangling loose ends multiplying at an unmanageable rate, suddenly there were just two episodes left to tie them up ... and boy did they divide opinions. The show's demise was pretty much sign-posted at the start of episode 25, in the form of a cop out statement about only having time to focus what's going on in Shinji's head - it's almost an admission from the makers that they've left themselves with far too much to do. And because the show ran out of budget, these final two episodes were strung together using repetitive, recycled footage, interlaced with repetitive, introspective monologues. Earlier in the series, repetition techniques were often used to great effect, coming off as an autistic, obsessive way of portraying mental problems, but although it still had its compelling moments in the last two episodes, it was over-used to the point where Hideaki was in danger of looking like a one-trick pony.\nStill, the shittiness of those last two episodes didn't stop people from over analysing its every small detail. Inevitably, they were seen as a stroke of genius by some. Of course, the show encouraged this kind of over-analysis throughout its run with its almost fetishistic obsession with symbolisms. A lot of it wasn't even that effective or meaningful, and were only thrown in because the makers thought it would be cool to have them. A classic example of this is the cross-shaped explosions - it looked so odd and was so ludicrously unsubtle that I originally didn't realise it was meant to be symbolic ... I thought it was just some weird stylistic choice.\nOverall, I definitely enjoyed my second viewing of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" more than the first. Then again, I did originally watch the show with very little prior knowledge about it, and as a result found it confusing. This being the case, how much of this extra enjoyment is due to understanding gained from sources outside of this series? How much of the merit of story can be credited to this incompletely package, and how much of it should go to all the extensive backfilling of details over the years through sequels and manga? The colossal influence of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" may be undeniable, but with all its issues - the inconsistent tones, the mess of a story, Shinji's crappy harem and the catastrophic ending - I don't think it deserves a higher score.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=36,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion, perhaps one of the most divisive anime ever created, is one of my personal favorites. But I aim to be objective with my reviews, and I know full well that NGE is not without some potentially disagreeable qualities (hence its divisiveness). So I'll try to review this in a way that will help people figure out which side of the fence they'll probably end up on before they watch the show.\nWith that preface out of the way, onto the categories:\nStory - This is the heart of what makes NGE so divisive. If you're the type of person who needs or wants everything\n          \n        spelled out very clearly for them, then Evangelion probably isn't for you. A lot of the mythos required for a solid understanding of what transpires is, at best, only vaguely alluded to in the anime. Fortunately, if you're like me, and you're too lazy/dumb to painstakingly put the pieces together yourself but find yourself intrigued and wanting to know more, there's swarms of fans who've already put the pieces together for you. But even scouring Wikis and reading the most clear explanation of Evangelion's plot humanly possible is likely to make your head spin until a few additional viewings help it start to sink in. But this is part of the appeal of Evangelion... there's so many nuances, so many small references to obscure sci-fi flicks, etc. that you can rewatch it countless times and read up on it for months and still be able to find something new you hadn't noticed before.\nCharacters - Another big part of what makes NGE divisive is the cast of really screwed up characters. Some people equate likeable characters to being good characters, in which case NGE is an anime full of horrible characters. The only likeable character is Pen-Pen, a penguin who only gets minimal screentime to provide some occasional comedic relief. But if you have a preference for darker stories where the characters often aren't good or likeable people, then you might love Eva's well-realized cast of 3-dimensional characters.\nArt - Unmistakably 90's which, depending on your tastes, can be a good thing or a bad thing. I personally love it. The animation for its time was excellent and still holds up well today, at least until towards the end when Gainax started having financial issues.\nMusic - A truly iconic soundtrack that sets the groundwork for the Rebuild of Evangelion films' excellent soundtracks, but unlike those, it's not exactly booming with tracks that I'd want to listen to by themselves. But when accompanying the anime, they shine.\nVoice Acting (dub) - NGE features a well-cast dub, though some of the voice actors take a little while to really sink into their roles.\nThe Ending - Neon Genesis Evangelion has two equally divisive endings: The original TV ending, and the remade film ending aptly titled The End of Evangelion. The TV ending truly showcases the financial issues that Gainax was having at the time and is unlikely to be the ending that director Hideaki Anno originally envisioned, and for that reason I suggest watching the much better End of Evangelion in place of the last two episodes for your first viewing of Neon Genesis Evangelion. In fact, seeing the original ending is unnecessary in my opinion. But there are Eva fans who would wholeheartedly disagree with me in this regard, so I'll describe the two endings so that you can decide for yourself how you want to watch NGE instead of just blindly following my own personal opinion:\nEnding #1 The TV Ending - The final two episodes basically take place entirely inside of the main character Shinji Ikari's head as he deals with his psychological issues, with no real explanation of what's going on in the physical world outside of the character's mind. If you like minimalistic stuff and/or don't mind the lack of action, then this ending could be up your alley.\nEnding #2 The End of Evangelion - A dramatically more cinematic version of the ending, showing in exquisitely psychotic detail what's going on inside and outside of the character's mind. It's equally as weird as the TV ending, but is a much more visceral and visual trip.\nHopefully this review has helped you decide whether Neon Genesis Evangelion is right for you. But I hope that even if you don't think you'll like it, you at least give it a shot... you might be surprised. And even if you watch it and prove yourself right, you'll at least have an informed opinion on one of the most influential and divisive anime ever created.\n        "},

Se você não viu Neon Genesis Evangelion, vai se sentir perdido lendo ela.\nEvangelion certamente segura uma alta posição na lista de animes polarizantes. Enquanto uns o idolatram pela sua história original e pelos seus personagens realistas, bem escritos e profundos, outros o massacram por seu estilo de narrativa, supostamente, não entregar todas as informações necessárias para o completo entendimento e pelo seu teor psicológico simplesmente não fazer sentido nenhum.\nPela minha nota, não preciso nem dizer que estou do lado dos que o idolatram. Evangelion é, possivelmente, o anime mais influente da história. Não só teve uma\n          \n        grande relevância econômica no Japão da década de 90, sendo, junto com Ghost in the shell, um dos pilares que revitalizaram a indústria de animes e a própria economia do país, como também teve um grande impacto cultural, com sua influência podendo ser vista até os dias de hoje.\nA história começa com nosso protagonista, Ikari Shinji, se dirigindo à sede da organização chamada Nerv, após ser convocado por seu pai, Ikari Gendo, que é o comandante da mesma. Uma coisa bem interessante de se notar no primeiro episódio, é como, em várias cenas, a direção da obra coloca Shinji no centro da tela e o rodeando estão a chefe de operações Katsuragi Misato e a Drª. Akagi Ritsuko, ambas, membros da Nerv. Durantes essas cenas, é curioso que Shinji não tem nenhuma linha de diálogo, exceto quando ele é chamado por uma das duas, e apenas as duas personagens já mencionadas tem falas. Além disso os diálogos entre as duas são sobre assuntos que de alguma forma afetam a vida de nosso protagonista. Isso é uma forma intuitiva da direção nos dizer que Shinji está no centro de tudo, mas mesmo assim ele não tem voz ou poder de decisão. E não é verdade? Bom, pelo menos pela maior parte do tempo sim.\nNarrativa: O storytelling de Evangelion é como um quebra cabeça. Ao longo dos episódios, várias peças vão sendo fornecidas ao telespectador e o trabalho de montá-las fica com quem está assistindo, não espere que o anime vá te entregar tudo pronto, pois isso definitivamente não acontece. A parte visual é muito importante e nos diz bastante sobre alguns pontos do enredo. Um exemplo bem simples disso é a lança de longinus. Em uma primeira assistida, ela pode parecer um elemento brotado do nada na história no fim do ep 14, mas os mais atentos, ou os que viram ao anime mais de uma vez, percebem que no ep 12 Gendo e Fuyutsuki(o vice comandante da Nerv) vão até o polo sul e a recuperam. A lança é mostrada sendo transportada num navio em uma cena que dura uns 3 segundos. Se você não prestar atenção nisso a lança vai parecer um elemento surgido do limbo no anime, e a obra não vai mais se preocupar em explicar da onde aquilo veio. Em Evangelion é preciso interligar muitos pontos, nem sempre próximos uns dos outros, para entender completamente sua história. Claro, existem informações que simplesmente não estão no anime. Uma das principais fontes de informações extras é o jogo de Playstation Neon Genesis Evangelion 2, o qual teve participação do próprio Hideaki Anno. Na minha opinião, isso não é um problema, não é como se o autor estivesse tentando corrigir ou alterar coisas do anime, ele apenas adicionou mais informações ao universo da obra. O anime em si já fornece o suficiente pra se entender boa parte da história, e no fim das contas, todos sabemos que o foco de Evangelion é nos personagens e não em alienígenas ou lutas de robôs contra anjos, portanto o que a obra nos dá já basta. Falando em personagens…\n\nSem dúvida, o ponto alto da série são seus realistas e profundos personagens. O fato deles serem realistas e cheios de nuances se deve muito ao criador da obra, Hideaki Anno. Isso porque ele não apenas criou personagens, durante sua depressão de 4 anos, ele esteve na pele dos personagens. Vamos começar por Shinji, o protagonista. Ele é um garoto de 14 anos que teve uma infância difícil. Perdeu sua mãe enquanto ainda era criança e foi abandonado por seu pai, também enquanto criança. Não precisa pensar muito para chegar à conclusão de que uma pessoa como essa não vai crescer sem problemas psicológicos, e Evangelion faz questão de mostrar isso com maestria. Shinji acaba se tornando um adolescente inseguro, com baixa autoestima e incapaz de estabelecer laços e comunicar seus sentimentos às outras pessoas. O dilema do ouriço, apresentado no episódio 3, com certeza é um aspecto importante para se entender o personagem. Ao mesmo tempo que anseia por afeto, Shinji tem medo de se aproximar das pessoas e acabar se machucando ou machucando elas, como Kaworu diz no episódio 24, se você nunca se aproximar das pessoas, nunca irá se machucar, mas também será incapaz de esquecer a solidão, logo é um paradoxo. Esse medo de se aproximar e estabelecer laços é mostrado várias vezes durante a série. É muito comum ver Shinji dando respostas condescendentes para evitar conversas prolongadas ou críticas, como a própria Asuka diz em certo ponto. Sem me estender muito, vamos para Asuka. Assim como Shinji, e todo mundo nesse anime, Asuka teve uma vida nada fácil, perdeu sua mãe de uma forma bem traumática quando criança. Sua mãe, devido a situações contadas no anime, se tornou uma pessoa completamente insana que tratava uma boneca de pano como sua própria filha e ignorava a verdadeira. Portanto, Asuka também cresceu com problemas psicológicos. Assim como Shinji, ela também vive uma conflito paradoxal. Ao mesmo tempo que ele afirma ser independente e capaz de viver sozinha, ela é desesperada para mostrar isso às pessoas que a cercam. Ela quer ser adulta e resolvida com a vida, mas também quer que os outros vejam e confirmem isso para ela. Sua obsessão por Kaji demonstra muito bem esse conflito interno que a aflige. Outra personagem que vale a pena destacar aqui é Ayanami Rei. Além de ser muito importante pro enredo, ela, como o resto dos personagens, é muito bem escrita. A princípio, Rei parece uma boneca sem sentimentos e sua relação com Gendo é a única coisa que lhe dá algum traço de humanidade. Porém, Shinji muda isso. Aos poucos, vemos uma boneca neutra se tornando mais humana, graças a evolução de sua relação com Shinji, relação essa que evolui de forma natural e se tornará extremamente importante em End of Evangelion. Existem mais coisas que podem ser faladas sobre os personagens, assim como existem mais personagens, mas esse texto ficaria imenso se eu fosse me estender mais, então prosseguindo.\nSobre a animação não se tem muito a dizer. Ela é muito boa até o episódio 13 e cai perceptivelmente de qualidade a partir do ep 14. O motivo é muito simples. Dinheiro.\nA trilha sonora também é excelente e bem posicionada. Varia desde músicas descontraídas e divertidas para cenas cômicas como a música tema da Misato, até as mais épicas e memoráveis como The beast.\nO final: Sem dúvida é uma das muitas partes polêmicas de Evangelion. Pra mim, os episódios 25 e 26 são os mais geniais de série inteira, o 26 particularmente, que foca mais no Shinji, é meu favorito. Não tem como negar. Não foi um final planejado. Blz mas e dai? Só porque não foi planejado não significa que não possa ser magnífico não é mesmo? Pra mim aquele final foi um milagre feito pela staff junto com Anno. Ele toma lugar na mente dos personagens e apresenta os conflitos internos de cada um. Tudo isso está ocorrendo durante a instrumentalidade humana. Você passa a entender os medos, os desejos e a visão de mundo de cada personagem, principalmente do Shinji. No episódio 26, nós vemos porque Shinji age como age, como ele se sente em relação a si mesmo e aos que o cercam. Entendemos o que ele deseja e do que ele tem medo. Esse final não é genial por si só, ele é genial porque se completa perfeitamente com o resto da série. Todas as ações do Shinji, as respostas condescendentes, o “não posso fugir”, o motivo pelo qual ele pilota o Eva passa a fazer sentido e então chegamos à conclusão, à mensagem que o anime passa. Shinji nota que a instrumentalidade é apenas um escapismo, um mundo onde ninguém existe, nem mesmo ele, e portanto nada de bom pode ser encontrado nele. Isso é tratado com mais detalhes em End of Evangelion. Então ele percebe que talvez um dia ele aprenda a se amar, talvez não tenha problema ele ficar no mundo onde nasceu, talvez. No fim das contas Evangelion passa uma mensagem otimista de esperança. Não se pode fugir da realidade, você deve seguir em frente e acreditar. Afinal, qualquer lugar pode ser um paraíso, desde que você decida continuar vivendo.\nEnglish version made by google translate so, sorry for some grammatical mistakes, even in this sentence :v\nWARNING: This review contains spoilers from the TV series. If you have not seen Neon Genesis Evangelion, you will feel lost reading it.\nEvangelion certainly holds a high position in the list of polarizing animes. While some idolize him by his original story and by his realistic, well-written and profound characters, others massacred him by his narrative style, supposedly not to deliver all the information necessary for complete understanding and for his psychological content simply to make no sense at all .\nBy my score, I don't even need to say that I am on the side of those who idolize him. Evangelion is possibly the most influential anime in history. Not only was it of great economic importance in Japan in the 1990s, but together with Ghost in the Shell, one of the pillars that revitalized the anime industry and the country's own economy, it also had a great cultural impact with its influence and can be seen to this day.\nThe story begins with our protagonist, Ikari Shinji, heading to the headquarters of the organization called Nerv, after being summoned by his father, Ikari Gendo, who is the commander of it. One very interesting thing to notice in the first episode is how, in several scenes, the direction of the work puts Shinji in the center of the screen and surrounding him are chief of operations Katsuragi Misato and Dr. Akagi Ritsuko, both members of Nerv. During these scenes, it is curious that Shinji has no line of dialogue except when he is called by one of the two, and only the two characters already mentioned have speeches. In addition the dialogues between the two are about matters that somehow affect the life of our protagonist. This is an intuitive way of telling us that Shinji is at the center of everything, but he still has no voice or decision-making power. And is not it true? Well, at least most of the time, yes.\nNarrative: Evangelion's storytelling is like a puzzle. Throughout the episodes, several pieces are supplied to the viewer and the work of assembling them stays with whoever is watching, do not expect the anime to deliver everything ready for you, because this definitely does not happen. The visual part is very important and tells us a lot about some points in the plot. A very simple example of this is the spear of longinus. In a first aided, it may seem like an element sprouted out of nowhere in the story at the end of the 14th ep, but the more attentive, or those who have seen the anime more than once, realize that in ep 12 Gendo and Fuyutsuki Nerv) go to the south pole and recover it. The boom is shown being carried on a ship in a scene that lasts for about 3 seconds. If you do not pay attention to it, the spear will seem like a limbo element in the anime, and the play will no longer bother to explain where it came from. In Evangelion it is necessary to interconnect many points, not always close to each other, to fully understand its history. Of course, there is information that simply is not in the anime. One of the main sources of extra information is the Playstation Neon Genesis Evangelion 2 game, which had the participation of Hideaki Anno himself. In my opinion, this is not a problem, it is not as if the author was trying to correct or change things of the anime, he just added more information to the universe of the work. The anime itself already provides enough to understand much of the story, and in the end, we all know that the focus of Evangelion is on the characters and not on aliens or robot fights against angels, so what the work gives us Enough. Speaking of characters ...\n\nUndoubtedly, the highlight of the series are his realistic and deep characters. The fact that they are realistic and full of nuances is due a lot to the creator of the work, Hideaki Anno. This is because he not only created characters, during his depression of 4 years, he was in the skin of the characters. Let's start with Shinji, the protagonist. He is a boy of 14 years who had a difficult childhood. He lost his mother while still a child and was abandoned by his father, also as a child. You do not have to think too hard to come to the conclusion that a person like this will not grow up without psychological problems, and Evangelion is keen to show it off. Shinji eventually becomes an insecure teenager with low self-esteem and unable to bond and communicate his feelings to other people. The hedgehog dilemma, presented in episode 3, is certainly an important aspect of understanding the character. At the same time that he longs for affection, Shinji is afraid to approach people and end up hurting or hurting them, as Kaworu says in episode 24, if you never get close to people, you will never hurt yourself, but you will also be unable to forget the solitude, soon is a paradox. This fear of approaching and bonding is shown several times during the series. It is very common to see Shinji giving condescending answers to avoid prolonged conversations or criticism. Without extending much, we go to Asuka. As well as Shinji, and everyone in this anime, Asuka had an uneasy life, lost his mother in a very traumatic way as a child. Her mother, due to situations told in the anime, became a completely insane person who treated a rag doll as her own daughter and ignored the truth. Therefore, Asuka also grew up with psychological problems. Like Shinji, she also experiences a paradoxical conflict. At the same time that he claims to be independent and capable of living alone, she is desperate to show it to the people around her. She wants to be adult and settled with life, but she also wants others to see and confirm it for her. His obsession with Kaji demonstrates very well this inner conflict that afflicts her. Another character worth mentioning here is Ayanami Rei. Besides being very important to the plot, she, like the rest of the characters, is very well written. At first, Rei looks like a doll without feelings and his relationship with Gendo is the only thing that gives him some trace of humanity. However, Shinji changes that. Gradually we see a neutral doll becoming more human, thanks to the evolution of their relationship with Shinji, a relationship that evolves naturally and will become extremely important in End of Evangelion. There are more things that can be said about the characters, just as there are more characters, but this text would be immense if I were to extend myself further, then go on.\nAbout animation you do not have much to say. She is very good until episode 13 and drops noticeably from quality from point 14. The reason is very simple. Money.\nThe soundtrack is also great and well positioned. It ranges from relaxed and entertaining songs to comedic scenes like Misato's theme song, to the most epic and memorable ones like The Beast.\nThe ending: Undoubtedly it is one of many controversial parts of Evangelion. For me, episodes 25 and 26 are the most genius of the whole series, the 26 in particular, which focuses more on Shinji, is my favorite. There is no denying it. It was not a planned end. Blz but so? Just because it was not planned does not mean it can not be magnificent does it? For me that end was a miracle done by the staff along with Anno. It takes place in the minds of the characters and presents the internal conflicts of each one. All of this is occurring during human instrumentality. You get to understand the fears, desires and worldview of each character, especially Shinji. In episode 26, we see why Shinji acts as he does, how he feels about himself and those around him. We understand what he wants and what he is afraid of. This end is not genius by itself, it is great because it completes perfectly with the rest of the series. All of Shinji's actions, the condescending responses, the \"I can not get away\", the reason he pilots Eva makes sense and then we come to the conclusion, the message that the anime goes through. Shinji notes that instrumentality is just an escapism, a world where no one exists, not even him, and therefore nothing good can be found in him. This is covered in more detail in End of Evangelion. Then he realizes that maybe one day he'll learn to love himself, maybe it's okay for him to stay in the world where he was born, maybe. In the end Evangelion passes on an optimistic message of hope. You can not escape reality, you must move on and believe. After all, any place can be a paradise, as long as you decide to continue living.\n        "},

No matter where you browse, with who you discuss and whose recommendations you listen to - you can't split past NGE. This anime\n          \n        is probably one of the most successful animes and TV series overall, being so unique and controversial at the same time. Created and airing over 15 years ago, this series might be older than most people who watch it in 2015, the year this review was written. A lot of uncertainities and speculations exist about the production of this anime, and I highly recommend reading for example the wikipedia page to further understand why the show and story progressed how it progressed.\nStory: 8/10\nMostentimes, a action show is made by the stories and characters. While NGE isnt too different from that, this aspect also makes it so good. The story seems very normal at first, but then begins to thicken and deepen, until a genius world development is finished which just baffles you. Halfway through the show, it decides that the story is now a minor part compared to the characters. This leads to a shift in focus: the story becomes a sideplot next to character development, and character development basically becomes the story. You get a great insight into the human mind, the struggles and worries of the characters who represent just about any normal person you could encounter nowadays. You won't be disappointed by the story, but make sure to pay attention: more than one concept is more complicated than you might think.\nArt: 8/10\nThis is the hardest part to judge. The show is 18 years old, you can't expect it to be on par with todays great quality animes. Nonetheless I gave it an 8, because (contrary to my expectations), the low quality art wasnt a turnoff at all, moreso it even contributed to the atmosphere created while watching. Its generic, but good if you take into consideration the then available technology.\nSound: 10/10\nWhile the ED was unfitting and not enjoable, the OP was definitely one big point of enjoyment for me. It creates and further underlines the whole atmosphere of the shows and adds a lot to the watching experience. Soundtrack and voices are perfect, the sound department of the show wasnt underfunded at all, thats for sure. Great job right there.\nCharacter: 10/10\nSome people might consider NGE confusing, others would even call it a mindfuck. This isnt untrue, but its right just for the last few episodes. AS I already mentioned, the focus shifted mid-series from the story to the single characters and deeply explains and tries to show their emotions, struggles and thoughts. The protagonists, Shinji, mind is basically opened to the watcher in a explosion of appealing tropes and themes combined with a, lets call it \"special\" art. Most viewers- me included- probably found the ending and the psychological parts extremely confusing, and I recommened everyone to watch \"The End of Evangelion\" if they are not satisfied with the ending. But if you're ready to think and read a bit about the psychological context surrounding the characters, I assure that you won't be disappointed. You might even understand it on the fly and so get a great insight into human minds, daily struggles and the subject of instrumantality.\nENjoyment: 8/10\nWHile the anime, in retrospective, was very good, there are a whole bunch of bother points to me. The art, of course, just feels sloppy after watching a modern show (but that doesnt really count, lets be honest). However the low-quality second part of the series and the partly extremely disappointing ending of the series leaves a lot of plotholes and might be considered a major turnoff. If you didn't pay full attention, youre just left confused at the end and quickly lose yourself in the various aspects of the show. So in short, while the series is great as it is, I highly doubt that it couldn''t have been even better. But then again, thats what makes NGE so good and unique and I wouldn't want to change it in any way.\nOverall: 9/10\nProbably the most inspiring and effectful anime of all time, this is a must watch for everyone who ever said \"I watch anime\". So many things and emotions you can derive from this anime can be precious and interesting to engulf in, and I highly recommend everyone to do that. This isnt a series to read reviews about, so that you're in the clear whether to watch it or not- you just have to watch it.\nWhen youre done with the series, consider watching the reboots and definitely watch the movies. It will satisfy your need for more if thats what you want, after finishing the series.\n**I'm still new to writing reviews, so I'd be thankful for every advice you can give me. Thanks for reading!**\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Yeah, this review is more of an analysis and covers each aspect, but also analyses the plot and characters to interpret its meaning. Also, I´ll just cover Evangelion, as well as The End of Evangelion.\nThe October 4th of the year 1995. Just like today and the day before, people all around the world woke up, went to work or school, came home and forgot the day. It was just like any other day, because that´s exactly what it was to you. But in Japan, this day might´ve been a bit different. No, there was no earthquake striking the island, no, there was no scandal surrounding\n          \n        your favorite politician and no, the fire department didn´t save a cat from a tree. Well, maybe they did, but it wasn´t noteworthy. The reason this day is special is linked to the first episode of a new anime, airing on television. It was the creation of Hideaki Anno, produced by Studio Gainax, previously known for their works on Gunbuster!. This show was called Neon Genesis Evangelion and it was one, that would go down in the industry as probably one of the biggest and most influential anime of all time.\nEvangelions influences may be undeniable, even if you fucking hate this show with a burning passion. I often hear it among the lines of \"anime that saved the industry\" or \"anime that brought the medium to a western audience\". And sure, this may be true, but I don´t think its influence can be considered this impactful. If it didn´t exist, another show would´ve taken its place. Either way the industry wouldn´t have died and the western audience will get its snippets every now and then. Despite that, Evangelions main influence comes within the industry. Shows, like KareKano, Gurren Lagann, Revolutionairy Girl Utena, Welcome to the NHK would not exist or they would be highly different. Evangelion is also known for bringing us millions of archetypes, which at this point may have been done to death, which would make the show outdated, if it didn´t do them so much more well than others.\nBut that´s enough for all this. Spending two paragraphs describing the anime doesn´t make my writing any more valuable to you. I should just get started talking about the meat of this.\nPresentationwise, Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the best shows to ever be made. Its artstyle, for the time, looked beautiful and even for nowadays standards, I would call it one of the best-looking shows ever made. The color pallete is perfectly choosen to inflict a darker atmossphere, while not making it feel grey or lifeless. At other times, it might seem a lot more colourful, in scenes that aren´t supposed to be dark. The directing may be some of the best ever done. Shots are beautifully composed to make each punch harder, each shot deeper and each transition flowing. Many different technics can be noted, which are used to perfect the directing to this extend. Character and background designs are beautifully detailed, enough to stick to my mind, while still working perfectly in the context of the show. A perfect and iconic example may be the plugsuit, which is perfectly recognizable with this this show. The animation flow, as well, is beautiful. Each scene flows gracefully, may it be a action sequence or just a random sequence of fucking around.\nSound may be the weakest point of this show, despite it being pretty much brilliant. Evangelions soundtrack, composed by Shiro Sagisu, may be one of my 5 favorite soundtracks in all of anime, alongside Berserk, Haibane Renmei, FLCL and Kara no Kyoukai. Many tracks are there just to create a atmossphere in a scene. The sound design mixed in, can create any type you want. You can have a silly feeling surrounding a silly scene or a suspenseful feeling surrounding a suspenseful scene. Both examples work beautifully well, in which the OST itself doesn´t stick out too much, while contributing to the anime itself. At other times, like with the iconic track(from the EoE movies), Komm Süßer Tod(translates to Come Sweet Death) is perhaps my favorite song in any OST ever. It gives me the feels, man. The sound design is also quite well-made and doesn´t stick out in any way to distract from the scene. Voice acting performances are extremly well-done. Most seiyuus used in Eva are now notorious for such. They are extremly talented and perfectly fit the voice of the character, they´re portraying.\nWhile it may be brilliant presentationwise, the real fukin meat of the show comes with its story and characters. Evangelion may be the one show, that personally connects with me the most, even more than any western show, which is due to this reason.\nStarting off with the character cast is main character Shinji Ikari. After he was abandoned by his father Gendo, he comes back to pilot one of the Eva. He is essential for the plot, as the viewer sees (almost) everything through his perspective. He is probably the only character the viewer can relate to. Sure, he may appear whiny to most, but I´m pretty sure most people wouldn´t get into a giant robot and defend humanity from aliens, just like that. Through the course of the story, he has to learn to overcome his self-hatred somehow, while maturing to get the job done. His character arc takes a wild ride, culminating in the climax (pun intended) during the first half of the End of Evangelion movie.\nCharacter numero dos is Rei Ayanami. During most of the story, her background isn´t fully clear, hell, her thoughts aren´t clear either. Rei is essentially acting like an emotionless doll most of the time, only showing emotions at some points. Shinji shittalking Gendo and the ending of the fight against Ramiel may be the best examples of that. Despite people more often shipping her with Shinji, I´m actually sure she isn´t sexually attracted to anyone, which leds me to believe that she sees Gendo as a father figure. Despite her thoughts being unclear, she is the girl, who only lives to get the job done right, even if she doesn´t get to live much more afterwards. \nCharacter nummer drei is Asuka Langley Soryuu a.k.a. the best girl. She doesn´t even appear until later in the story, just to completely flip the fabric of this story around. Her sudden appearance pretty much turns Eva almost comedic again after the build-up of the relation between Shinji and Rei. Despite her apparent personality of being annoying (I will get on that later), I can´t help, but find every interaction with her in it absolutely adorable. Shut up. I don´t think she´s actually annoying, but more or less easy to irritate and blunt to most people. Hat vielleicht was mit den Genen zu tun. Her main motto may be to get the job done right, better than anyone else, even if it kills you. Ironically it is this mentality, that causes her to fail a mission, which just caused even more fuck for her. Her backstory is revealed later, in which she didn´t have her parents, making her decide to do everything herself and become the best she can be. This is the reason for her manic behavior and her desire to put dignity over her life or health.\nCharacter numéro quatre is Misato Katsuragi. Her purpose in the story is less of an active character (symbolically speaking) and more of an outsider to Rei, Asuka and Shinji, considering that she never sets foot into a eva. Despite me, liking Rei and Asuka much more, Misato might be the best character in the show. Even if the viewer is a Shinji by heart, everyone would want to be Misato. She´s the woman to get job done right, in whatever way it may be. Aside of that, she´s also the coolest cat in the show and also the only person, that seems to enjoy not being dead. Well, for the most part at least. Even though she´s the only character not appearing mentally fucked, she has as much of a backstory, that does fuck with her. To me, that always kinda said that even if someone might appear to not be as fucked as you, they probably are, they´re just really good at hiding that fact.\nAside of these four main characters, Gendo and Kaworu are important to the plot. Gendo is Shinjis father, he is kind of a dick. Most of his actions aren´t to do anything evil however, most of them are just there, because he´s trying to get his job done right, even if it costs someones sanity. Kaworu only appears for one episode, but has a major impact on Shinji, being the only character he seems to connect with, only to have to crush him, literally. I know how it makes me sound like a cringeworthy Tumblr prodigy, but I´m sure Shinji is bisexual. It´s obvious to me, that he wanted the little something more from Kaworu, if you know what I´m saying.\nAside of these 6 characters, the secondary character cast is quite good too. Every character has a distinct character, even if they don´t appear for much in the story. The main focus being on the main cast, they aren´t too important to the story, while serving a purpose to keep it going. They are well-done, I can´t say much more.\nA misconception, that makes me think people don´t get the show itself, is how Shinji is a whiny pussy or Asuka is annoying or Gendo is Worst Father 2015. As I said, the viewer is supposed to see the anime through Shinjis perspective. You think Shinji is a whiny pussy? Do you know who else thinks that? That´s right, Shinji. And do you know who else thinks Gendo is a dick and Asuka is annoying? That´s right, Shinji. It´s easy to say, even if they´re meant to be shit, they´re still shit, which isn´t necessarily wrong. But most of the time, your impression of someone might not be all that truthful. Shinji may appear whiny, but he still tries to do as much as he can with his anxiety. Asuka may appear bitchy, but she´s more or less just easy to irritate and blunt. Gendo may appear horrible, but he just tries whatever he can do get the job done, without regard for anyone specific.\nInsert Gendo did nothing wrong meme.\nAnother important thing, that I noticed, is the interactions between characters one to quatre. Think of Shinji as your depressed voice in your head and Asuka your manix voice, Rei being your outside, what you show to people. Asuka hates Shinji and Rei, because fuck them. Shinji is intimidated by Asuka, but tries everything for Rei. Rei shows no emotion. This constellation is meant to represent one human being split into three parts, interacting with each other, thinking and doing things independently. Misato on the other side is the character, which is supposed to see everything happen from the outside, trying to change things within or just judge what is happening.\nEvangelion is a completely character driven story. One of its main themes is that everyone is fucked inside and people are just too complicated to ever get behind. No matter how hard you look, you can never get into the head of the people around you or even in our own head. Meanwhile there will be people, who will make you suffer even further, without ever answering the question of guilt or being satisfied by the result. This is, at least, what I take from NGE.\nStorywise, let´s just say \"symbolism\". That might ring a bell for you.\nThe story of Eva is on one hand there to have a stressful situation, in which the character can be developed into the wrecks they are. However, most of the story is also a giant feast for anyone willing to look into anything further. Even without reading through millions of philosophy publications, most people should be able to decipher some stuff that is shown.\nIn itself, Evangelion has a quite interesting plot, in which aliens, called angels attack earth with only a few 14 year old kids in mech robots to attack and kill them. The pacing of it all is very good. The story takes multiple turns and is kindof epic within the first few episodes, then shifts once Asuka arrives, only to shift into a apocalyptic drama by episode 16, only to go into complete dementia by episode 22 until the end of End of Eva. The foreshadowing works quite well, the writing is tight and the story can be about as suspenseful as you can possibly get. But of course, this is only face value, as the story itself is much deeper inside its core.\nThe first thing I notice is the Neon Genesis in the name, which means nothing more than New Age. One thing that reminds me of such is the popular God is Dead publication by Friedrich Nietzsche. Eva shows a bunch of characters killing angels, only to be reborn as alien-like creatures by the end of it. God is Dead is meant to interpreted as humanity destroying their own believes, meaning that they themselves have to become a metaphorical god. Perhaps Eva is a story of humanity moving on to become their own god and create their own world. a similar interpretation lies within the New Age movement, in which religion is supposed to be remade or scraped as a whole, to open doors for humanity to a \"new age\". NGE contains many notions of such movement, including Aura as the AT-field and the angel Leliel as a higher godly dimension. The new age movement always has a common idea of optimism and uniting humanity as a whole. Even without this knowledge, it is easy to interpret, that evangelion is holding a mirror against this, questoning if humanity should be reunited and if past tragedies can be turned so easily into positive waves, bruh.\nAnother interpretation, that is very popular, comes with our good friends, the jews. In the judaistic mythology, Lilith was the first woman of Adam, which was banned from eden, only to birth the demon baby Lilim. Only after Lilith came Eva to the the mix. Evangelion essentially is meant to be seen as humanity not being born by Adam and Eva, but Adam and Lilith. Just like how Eva was made from one of Adams ribs, the Eva robots were made from parts of the angel Adam. Another analogy is the logo of NERV, which I found out is a fig leaf, the same thing used by Adam and Eva to hide their nakedness.\nYet another way of interpreting the Evangelion story comes with a radical christian flow, the gnosticism. It is based on the idea, that through one accident by humanity, we were split from god, a.k.a. Every day we stray further from god. This idea also comes with humanity containing one piece of god or goodness within them, despite never being able to reach it. Within this idea, any person, after their death, is going to salvation or they´re going to wait until judgement day. If we interpret Evangelion within this theory, we could say that no one wants the Third Impact or judgment day to happen, but one persons action may be able to trigger this event, in which case god may be the one to do that, only because he´s longing for salvation himself.\nLooking deeper into the events of Evangelion, it might also seem that they have a large affinity towards eastern religions, like Shintoism, maybe more than monotheistic western religions. This interpretation may even fill in the gaps, that the judaistic interpretation left wide open. According to shintoism, the world was created by the god pair Izanagi and Izanami, which, on a bridge, put their lance into water and then created japan. That lance still remained on earth afterwards. mayn generations and cases of godly incest later, there were even more gods, a lot of them to be exact. Amaterasu was the god of the sun, who was bullied by her brother, until she left to live in a cave somewhere, making the universe dark. After her sisters and brothers came for her, she went back to create light in the universe once again.\nBuddhism is yet another edge to the already quite complicated paper. It is based on four \"truths\".\n1. Living is suffering\n2. Suffering comes from greed\n3. Overcoming greed means overcoming suffering\n4. This happens with the eight-split path\nIf you manage to have the highest score in meditating, then after your death, you´re going to Nirvana, even though I´d prefer Pearl Jam. Nirvana is not some kind of death scene, where you´re simply dead, but more or less a realm, where all life as it is, is one. However, no one can force you to go to Nirvana and no one can do anything for you, you have to buddhism yourself. Tying in with the character-driven plot is the belief, that you´re indeed going to be reincarnated and if you were a nice guy, you can be reincarnated as a better person. The soul itself doesn´t search for a new body, it can´t split apart, this will happen. In this way, Rei not eating meat can be interpretated as her knowing that other animals have souls, because of the soul part of Lilith inside her. This interpretation seems too plausible to not be true, if you consider that verses out of the Dhammapada a.k.a. the buddhist bible, are eerily similar to events from the show.\nOf course, such interpretations can never be confirmed to be completely true. Despite the knowledge that none of this is 100% true to be intended, these interpretations show a clearly nihilstic and humanity-critical edge. The judaistic interpretation is meant to be interpretated as humanity being the childs of the devil and not god. We are essentially evil incarnated, if you want to see it that way. The gnostic interpretation, which seems like the least likely to be actually be true, means that humanity can be something good inside, if we wouldn´t be the biggest douchebags in the universe and beyond. The new age interpretation means that humanity is a mess and instead of believing in mythical beings and men with long beards, we should become our own god and do something to be a good god. The buddhist interpretation considers humanity as not worthwhile enough to move forward yet, until the main characters will learn their lessons. And lastly, the shintoic interpreation could be another way to tell the story of Evangelion from start to finish, as a japanese, mythical epic.\nMost people will say that a interpretation isn´t making the story any deeper, but actually it does. Evangelion is just another religious epic and just like other religions, there are different ways to interpret it and spell out a different meaning. Jesus appears in the Coran, but he has next to no meaning in it. The exact same thing is happening in Neon Genesis Evangelion. You can interpret one thing as another thing and give it a different meaning, it is up to you. The meaning is clearly nihlistic, dark and possibly critical against humanity, society and religion, which is definitely intended. The only thing open, as said, is what detail you find the most important and how much meaning you´re going to give everything. Saying because you´re not spoon-feed what to think by the end of it, doesn´t mean that there is no meaning in this story.\nAnyways, I will close off this review of mine now. I had quite a lot of fun writing all of this, even if it took me a few hours. The main reason I did write it so long is mainly because Evangelion is my favorite thing ever and I can personally connect with it more than with any other show. I know you won´t have the same feeling to it as me and I know why people would dislike it, but to me Evangelion is about as good as anything can possibly get.\nBefore I end this, I want to add anime and manga, that are highly similar in one way or the another, which should be interesting to people, who enjoyed Evangelion:\n-Revolutionairy Girl Utena\n-The Tatami Galaxy\n-Oyasumi Punpun\n-Dead Dead Demons Dedededestruction\n-Welcome to the NHK\n-FLCL\n-Gurren Lagann\n-Madoka Magika\n-Zegapain\n-Gunbuster!\n-Serial Experiments Lain (and any other Abe work, actually)\n-Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind\n-KareKano\n-Berserk\n-Aku No Hana\nThis should be enough for today, bye.\n        "},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=35,   ["text"]="                          \n    Gainax's staggeringly ambitious, 26-episode series Neon Genesis Evangelion is declared as one of the most compelling Anime productions of all time. It also happens to be one of most controversial. On one side of the coin are a bunch of loyal, unbending followers that idolize the show. On the other are a group of naysayers who say otherwise. As far as my views of Evangelion are concerned, I fall somewhere in the middle. In many ways, the show is indeed brilliant and thought provoking--something rarely seen in any animated production, American or Japanese. At the same time, however, there are elements of Evangelion that rub\n          \n        me the wrong way. \nThe show, set in post-apocalyptic Tokyo-3, involves alien-like monsters known as 'Angels' that continually threaten the metropolis. Only psychologically messed up teenagers -- who include introverted Shinji Ikari, enigmatic Rei Ayanami, and mean-spirited Asuka Langley Sohryu -- stand a chance against them. They do this by piloting their Evangelions -- giant, superpowerful, robot-like fighters. In charge of the whole thing is Misato Katsuragi, a tough, no-nonsense woman who cares for the children while dealing with her own issues. Also calling the shots is Shinji's cold, unsympathetic father, Gendo Ikari, who seems to have an agenda of his own, although we're not entirely clear about what it is. And then there is the matter over whether the real threat in Tokyo-3 is in the presence of the Angels or an even more ominous organization, known as SEELE, which is occasionally seen as a group of tabloids with numbers. \nAs mentioned, there are many aspects of Evangelion that are good and bad. The technical aspects of this show are impressive -- particularly the dramatic and emotionally charged battles between the EVAs and the grotesquely designed angels; a sense of mystery and intrigue exudes from its complex storyline. As a matter of fact, the show is at its best when it focuses on the conflict between the Angels and the human race. Furthermore, even though a majority of the characters are basically unlikable (save perhaps, for Misato), director Anno does dedicate some episodes delving into their tormented pasts. This is often done in surreal, bizarre, 'dream' like sequences involving kaleidoscopic imagery and inner thoughts. Also interesting (and sometimes disorienting) is the use of classical music for several episodes toward the end, notably Handel's 'Messiah' and Beethoven's 'Choral' Symphony.  (Speaking of which, Shiro Sagisu's moody and haunting score is very complimentary to this show, although it times it does delve into blandness.)\nIt has been widely touted that the characters of Evangelion are some of the most complex, socially washed out beings ever committed to Anime. On one level, it provides for some intriguing interactions, from Shinji's estranged relationships with both his father and the bitchy Asuka to Misato's own fractured love affair with her off again on again beau, Kaji. The character development becomes gradually less intriguing, however, as each episode exorcises the same angst-ridden issues over and over again, with little to no resolution. In the surprisingly grim and violent latter half of the series, the characters all head into a downward spiral. At the same time, Evangelion starts to become less intriguing (if sometimes confusing) and turns messy, almost to the point of being totally incomprehensible. Questions that viewers are likely to have about the plot are never answered, and some later episodes have scenes in which absolutely nothing happens that last too long. \nAnother problem with Evangelion is its ending or rather, lack thereof. While Gainax's previous TV show, Nadia, took a wrong turn at the midpoint, it did get recover for its last episodes and delivered a strong, if too short conclusion. Here, however, the story simply falls apart. The final two episodes, which are very much played out like extensive therapy sessions, eschew both action and coherency in favor of deconstructing the protagonists' minds. In doing so, it makes the mistake of underwhelming the audience. There are some interesting artistic styles, like Shinji being drawn as a sketch in deep space, but even this potentially experimental approach is compromised by the lack of a structure for a compelling conclusion. \nIn spite of its faults, Neon Genesis Evangelion is still worth watching for many reasons. Its impressively directed action sequences, intriguing mysteries, and in-depth character studies have been seldom matched in others of its kind. \n        "},

The story does becoming confusing which adds to it's greatness. Never quite sure of what lays at the core of the characters, it can be somewhat frustrating to never fully see the heart of certain characters \" Neon Genesis Evangelion: the end of Evangelion\" corrects this however, I'd highly recommend seeing the movie afterwards. It gives a sense of completion to the series.\nThe story itself is solid and interesting, the characters are a little shallow but the series is short and never had enough time to give complexity to anyone other than Shinji. \nThe\n          \n        characters are very likable however and play their part in the story well.

It's incredibly thought provoking while still delivering enough action to keep the story exciting. This story contains complex characters, and it's not a happy fairy tale by any means. In fact most characters are carrying heavy emotional trauma, and their relationships with each other are affected dramatically by their emotional scars. The tone remains dark throughout, and it ends with a psychological meltdown among many characters. I don't want to give anything away, but the ending has spawned a lot of controversy. A couple of follow up films have been made, but I personally preferred the ending\n          \n        as it was in the series.\nThe emotional and psychological struggles that the main character undergoes are what drive this story. The mystery of the Angels (the enemy humans are fighting) is not in short supply. The action scenes are fairly epic, and the concept is nothing short of amazing.

		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="                          \n    The all-famous Neon Genesis Evangelion... I spent years avoiding this anime due to it's 'controversial' nature. Finally, a few days ago, a friend of mine convinced me to watch it and I did, if only to see what the fuss was all about. Well, I found out all right.\n*This review also takes The End of Evangelion into consideration. There are very few spoilers, none of which really impact the viewing experience.\nStory (2/10):\nHonestly, I prefer anime that start off alright and end well, as compared to those that have strong starts and weak endings. NGE, on the other hand, started off pretty bad, was bearable near\n          \n        the middle... and did a nose-dive in the last few episodes. NGE spends 80% of it's screen-time showing us the escapades of Ikari Shinji, which mostly involves him running away and being a wimp in general. The rest of the time is spent quite liberally on mecha fights and the sexual activities of the remaining characters.\nI was seriously wondering what Hideaki Anno was smoking when he wrote the last few episodes... and then I watched The End of Evangelion... and realized that this level of insanity is beyond the capability of any drug.\nIt is often said that NGE has a lot of Religious and Psychological symbolism, but as far as I could see, the 'symbolism' was basically a bunch of crosses and huge floating vaginas (Yeah, you read that right). I even went as far as to read up some of this, to see if I just outright missed something... but in the end, it seems like everyone is trying to find meaning in something that is obviously nonsense - Feels like modern art.\n\nArt and Sound (7/10):\nI'm not much of a critic as far as art and sound are concerned. Both were decent for its time, though they may be relatively obsolete to a present day audience.\n\nCharacters (1/10):\nWhat is considered to be the strong point of NGE is actually by far its greatest weakness. It is often said that NGE has some of the most realistic characters in anime history... well, I wouldn't fully disagree - but that doesn't change the fact that I feel like beating some sense into them.\n-Ikari Shinji: The main character, who should've been killed as an infant. A 14-year-old kid who spends half his time wallowing in self-pity and the other half leching over all things female. That should be relatively normal for a young teen suffering from severe depression, but that doesn't make it any less annoying, considering how the fate of humanity is supposedly hanging in the balance. Nearly 4-5 episodes are spent on elaborating his escapist nature.\n-Ayanami Rei: Development? What development? Some 'shocking' revelations about her origins, but she remains a blank slate from beginning to end.\n-Sohryu Asuka Langley: Probably the most understandable of the three protagonists, but that doesn't make her any less annoying than Shinji. Her comments on Shinji are usually quite accurate and you often wonder why the others don't feel the same. Then again, her pride, vanity and disagreeable personality on the whole are hard to ignore.\nThere are plenty of other characters, such as Katsuragi Misato and Ikari Genji, who start out interesting and end up utterly two-dimensional (no pun intended). In fact, the only character I actually enjoyed watching was Pen-Pen, the penguin.\n\nEnjoyment (2/10):\nHard to express how terrible an anime NGE is... I almost dropped it many times, but went on just for the sake of completion. I hoped time and again that it might do a major turn-around in the last few episodes like Durarara, but what I got was a Guilty Crown 2.0\n\nOverall (3/10):\nFrankly, it's not worth your time. Some people (mostly the overly imaginative lot) may find some profound meaning in this one, but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone. For a Mecha series with a good deal of mindf*ck, the Muv Luv trilogy is a much better alternative (pun intended, for those who get it).\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=32,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    I recently watched this series a second time. I watched this back in my high school days and oh boy I had mixed feelings about it. I stumbled upon it accidentally at late night when a local channel was airing Neon Genesis Evangelion. I missed an episode here and there and I was constantly feeling disgusted about the series. I felt it was repulsing yet I always came back and wanted to know more about it. This was the feeling I was left when I watched the anime first time in my life. I did not want to watch it and yet I wanted to\n          \n        watch it.\nNow I have re-watched this controversial anime. I can be almost sure that you will love it or hate it, some of you might feel bored because the anime has quite slow pace. By this I mean that it's not slow paced in its story telling but I found the setting quite moody and slow like a song from a doom metal band like I was watching a dream and I feel this anime can also feel surreal .\nI really like the story and the setting. I am huge fan of sience fiction and this anime can throw in religious elements and still have the scifi jargon mumbo jumbo which I always like to hear. It does not feel forced but a part of it. I'd like to even say that Neon Genesis Evangelion's world is a mix of religious and science fiction aspects. In fact it reminds me of a Dan Simmon’s book Hyperion but I dare not to talk about it more because I would need a book to cover it if I start to compare NGE (Neon Genesis Evangelion) with other pieces of art and at the same trying to write a review about it.\nI was sucked in to the experience and in fact I watched the series in a few days marathon. This is a usually a point which makes a good experience for me you can’t just stop watching to the point it’s almost harmful. Some point I realized that the clock was 6:00 am and I overslept waking up at 2:00 pm. Maybe you will be hooked? Or you throw the anime over your shoulder after two episodes.\nSo the art is quite nice it’s almost vintage as been told in other reviews and the age of the anime shows but this is not a bad thing for me. The action scenes are really well made I can see that special care was taken in to them: they are fluid and an enjoyment to watch. But the main problem is that the action seems to fall short. I felt the villain was destroyed in one hit so you just got a small taste of the cake. I would have loved to see more epic long shifting battles but I guess they didn’t have the resources to do that.\nSadly there are many almost laughable moments when you are only shown a still image for couple of minutes. At first you could say this is an artistic solution which at first I thought it was. The still and anemic points integrate well with the slow pace and mood I mentioned earlier but the threshold is crossed just by a bit and you start to think that is there something wrong? Why the image is frozen? So in a way you can think that these moments are there to amplify the feeling of NGE: the gloomy mood which shadows everything. The gore and violence is executed perfectly in my opinion it’s not there for the shock effect like in many other works of fictions: Hey he’s head exploded and now there’s blood and brain matter everywhere how cool is that? In truth I felt disgusted when the gore was finally shown. Those moments are rare and very powerful they are not here just for the sake of violence.\nI really like the EVAs which are the mechas of this anime. They are slender and beautiful they seem like humans to me. I usually think mechas as bulky and buffed war machines. EVAs are colorful and I really love their design for me they are very memorable and unique. But with EVAs you could say that they are “more than meets the eye” if you keep watching the anime which makes them even more bizarre and to the point again very repulsive.\nApart from the great and catchy theme in the beginning of an episode I can’t say anything from the music. The theme is on my top anime openings of all time but the rest of the music did not seem to exist for me sure I realized there was music but it sounded boring and dull so I did not even try to listen to them. There is a music for an intense moment and when there is danger but they don’t hit your balls like the opening theme. I must say the howling of the Unit 01 was dreadful it sounded like a trapped and tortured being like it should and I almost did not want to hear it and this was the part of the repulsiveness  that I had when I was watching the anime. I felt sad and terrified when I heard the screaming and the howling.\nThis review is just expanding and while I am writing this I really feel I need to publish a book to cover everything I have to say. So about the characters: they are very deep. At first I hated one character but when the story unfolded I even felt sympathy for him. There are many sides to the characters and I feel they are realistic. Many have opinion about the main hero that’s he is an annoying sissy and a crybaby. Well to be honest I would cry and scream if I had to pilot a giant robot and fight monsters and experience pain and violence every day. Maybe these opinions are there because that we don’t want to see a weak hero in fiction. We want to be like the hero and we want to be strong and brave and we want to identify with the hero. But NGE can show how we people truly are: We as humans are flawed and most of us all really broken and all humans have their issues and negative sides. That’s why we have fiction so we can be somebody else but NGE does not give you that chance it tries to be realistic when it comes to characters. The creator’s mental state can be seen in characters and in fact I feel this anime resonates with my own depression and suicidal thoughts and at some points I felt even more anxious when I kept watching. I think that’s the charm of this anime because it reminds me of myself even though that side is not a pleasant side to see.\nSo in the end I feel this is an anime everyone should watch just for the sake of it. For the same reason we have Mona Lisa and people tend to go and watch it in Louvre you should watch this anime. I’ve tried to keep talking people to watch this because I would like to talk about it. I assume people are still after over ten years trying to make sense to it and speculating endlessly but that is watch makes a great experience for me. The enjoyment does not end after you have watched, read or played something: you want to talk and share your thoughts about it. In fact you don’t know how not to talk about it constantly. I almost gave this anime 10 out of 10 but because of technical execution in sound and animation and objectivity I lowered the score to 9. If this anime had the visuals of Hellsing Ultimate series or Vampire Hunter D: Blood Lust and memorable soundtrack I think this anime should be worshipped as a unique masterpiece: a pinnacle of great work of fiction."},

On the one hand, you have people championing it as the greatest work of imaginative fiction in human history, and on the other hand, you have others saying it is a complete waste of time. In my review of Rebuild of Evangelion 1.11, I said that the older tv version of Eva (namely, the version I'm reviewing right now) left me somewhat impressed\n          \n        and somewhat unimpressed at the same time. There are things seriously wrong with this show, and yet, at the same time, there are things it gets very right. By reading this, you will come to understand why my review of Rebuild was so glowing. So, what are my thoughts on the Eva tv series? Let's not run away any further and find out.\nStory: It's 2015. A disaster in 2000 called Second Impact destroyed Antarctica and killed a large portion of the human race. The ones responsible for this destruction were a race of monstrous beings known as Angels. These Angels are not cherubs, but rather, well, it's hard to explain without spoiling, but needless to say, they're really mad at humans. The only group that can fight the Angels is an organization called NERV, based in Tokyo-3. NERV is armed with huge cyborg machines called Evangelions, which can fight the Angels, however, they can only be piloted by children born after the Second Impact. The show mainly follows three of these pilots: Shinji Ikari, a reluctant, introverted boy who feels overburdened by the demand of piloting an Eva, Rei Ayanami, a mysterious, quiet, and emotionless girl who no one can seem to understand, and Asuka Langley Soryu, a brash, selfish girl with a mean streak. Together, they must combat the threat of the Angels. The show starts off as an action series, with moments of comedy and drama weaved in for good measure. Toward the end of the series, the \"Evas fighting Angels\" premise is largely forgotten. By the end, the series becomes a confusing, meandering, and illogical mess, filled with unanswered questions. It's a solid premise, but it doesn't follow that premise to the end.\nWith that said, I'm going to praise something most Eva fans seem to forget about; the action scenes. They are amazing. Each of the Angels has a unique gimmick that the pilots must work around in order to beat. Rarely is a battle ever as simple as, \"There's an Angel! Shoot it in the head!\" Both sides employ strategy in order to win, but also, none of the Evas ever get out of a fight unscathed. The battles are intense, and if only the whole series featured them, then I'd be more generous with the score. 7/10.\nArt: \"A 9? Are you serious!?\" Yes. This is the oldest work of Japanese animation that I have seen that still looks really good, even by today's standards. The character designs are outstanding; some of the best I've ever seen anywhere. (No surprise then that Yoshiyuki Sadamoto is one of my favorite character artists.) The designs of the Evas and Angels are very creative. Tokyo-3 and NERV are intricately detailed, and the animation during the action sequences is outstanding, and this, in a series made before the 2000s. If I do have one complaint, it's this: there's a lot of re-used footage, especially in the later episodes. That gets tiresome after a while. 9/10.\nSound: The soundtrack is a pretty good one. It's not a favorite of mine, but it's good. You may want to kill me for this, but I don't really find \"Cruel Angel's Thesis\" to be anything special.\nThe voice-acting in Japanese is superb. I know very little Japanese, but even I can tell that it is top-notch. Each voice is distinct and suits its character well, the acting is very natural, and even when a character is on the edge, they never sound forced nor unrealistic. The English dub? Uh, I guess you could say it's better than the first season of Pokemon done by 4Kids, but it is laughable. Most of the characters either don't sound their part, are comically over-acted, or both. The only voices that are anywhere near as good as the Japanese counterparts are Asuka and Ritsuko. Even if you have a choice between the 90s dubs and the redub from the 2000s, you're better off with the subs. Take it from me; if I, an ardent supporter of dubs, tell you NOT to watch a certain anime in English, take my word for it.\nCharacterization: Most of Eva's characters are very complex. Some of them are downright frighteningly realistic. Shinji gets a lot of flak for being \"emo\" and being caught up in despair, but I like him. He does have faults, but he behaves how anyone would in his situation. My favorite character, Misato Katsuragi, is a multi-layered character, one who is fun to watch in a comedic scene, cool to watch in an action scene, and hard to watch in a dramatic scene.\nHowever, there are some characters that are not fully explored, but are in other adaptations. Rei is little more than a girl who is unfamiliar with human emotion and only knows to do as she is told; she lacks the depth that she has in the manga adaptation and the Rebuild movies. Asuka does little more than shout, \"I'm an Eva pilot and I am awesome! LOVE ME!\" for most of the series, and even toward the end, when she is suffering from unholy Hell, I felt no sympathy for her. While she is still a selfish psychobitch (for lack of a better phrase) in the manga, she is much more fleshed-out, and much more relatable and likable. Her Rebuild counterpart, though not as fleshed-out (yet), is still more likable than her earlier anime counterpart. Kaworu just doesn't get enough screentime in this version to really get a good understanding of him. And even Shinji is portrayed more effectively in the Rebuild continuity. It's hard to go into further detail without spoiling, but the characterization really is better in the manga and Rebuild series. Even despite this, the cast of this version of Eva is more memorable than your typical run-of-the-mill mecha series. 8/10.\nEnjoyment: At times, my enjoyment was very high. The action scenes are great, Misato is awesome, and my favorite episode in the series, #18, contains one of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen in an anime. However, at other times, it wasn't. The only part of the last two episodes I liked was when Shinji saw what life would've been like without the Evas (which made enduring the psychobabble worth the effort). There are also some scenes where nothing happens; as in literally nothing happens. The most infamous of which is the end of episode #24, a scene that will make you shout, \"DO SOMETHING DAMN IT!\" This is why I love Rebuild so much, because it doesn't have these issues. 7/10.\nI have not seen The End of Evangelion, but I (really) don't plan to. So as it stands, the tv series version of Eva is not the best thing ever, but not a waste of my time, either. However, there is one truly outstanding thing about it; its ability to inspire. It has inspired many fanfics, some of which are beautifully written. It has inspired several published manga, one of which, the one by Sadamoto, is a terrific read, and is what turned me into an Eva fanatic. It has inspired many other anime, including my favorite anime of all time, Eureka Seven, which borrowed a few ideas from Eva. And it even inspired Anno to go back and remake Evangelion back in 2007, starting with Rebuild 1.11. If you want to watch this version of Eva, feel free to; just know that it does not live up to its full potential. And that it also sucks in English.\n        "},

Once you get past that God-sent opener, you are then drawn into the world of Angels and Evangelions. For fear of spoilers, I will leave my review here.

Where are they coming from? Why are they coming? Why do they want to destroy humanity? Is anything that was shown to the audience true? How does Gendo Ikari plan on combining all of human consciousness into one soup of nothingness? How were Evas designed from humans? What was Kaji's purpose? What actually caused the Second Impact?\nWhy is Asuka literally the\n          \n        worst? Why should I care about any of these characters? What the hell happened to any of Shinji's schoolmates who we were forced to spend time with? Are the last two episodes of this show fucking serious?  \nWhat Neon Genesis Evangelion does a horrible job at doing is answering literally any question that it raised. The middle arc of the show is almost completely worthless. It's the same formula as a Pokemon episode, more or less. Characters (main or ancillary) are talking while engaging in a somewhat menial activity (eating, sitting around at school, testing compatibility with Eva units or whatever), we see a character (usually Gendo) do something somewhat peculiar or suspicious. Oh no! An angel is attacking! Send out the Eva unit! Oh no it seems all hope is lost! There's a zero point zero zero zero zero one chance of us succeeding! But wait the kids believe or some shit! Oh yay we're all saved!\nSeriously, just replace \"angel\" with \"Team Rocket\" or \"random trainer Ash is battling this week\" and it's the same thing.\n\nThe last half of the show is just mind-fuckery under the guise of being 'deep' that just comes of as pointlessly edgy. Nothing is actually said in the last few episodes that was monumental in any way. It was just character exploration. But it was character exploration in the worst possible way. It was just talking. No action. Only dialogue. To explore a character we've spent 24 episodes with. We've been watching the show, we know about Shinji through his actions and responses to the people surrounding him, we don't need you to spell it out for us. \n\nSo that's why I think the story is poor at any rate. I could go into more detail but I don't want to beat a dead horse, unlike Neon Genesis Evangelion.\nThe art was pretty good for 1995 for a while. And then character's lips started moving less. And scenes started moving less. And then we spent minutes at a time on singular frames with voice acting overlaid. And then the last episode barely even tried to convey a respectable visual message. It looked like rough sketches of characters on literally an empty screen. So the diminishing quality of the animation greatly reduced the art score in my mind.\nThe voice acting was very not good. The only character whose voice I didn't end up despising was Shinji's. The opening theme was an alright one, though it didn't seem to fit with the show at all and the closing theme being Fly Me to the Moon covered *slightly* differently each episode seemed like a waste of time and money in my mind. The song doesn't really fit the show and one recording would have done just fine. The original music in the show was incredibly repetitive but at least the most played track was somewhat fun. At least until they decided to just play minutes at a time of public domain music. Bach's 1st Cello Suite? The Hallelujah chorus? Beethoven 9? Really? There was nothing artistic about their use, they just got thrown in for extended periods so something would play in the background of a scene. *Maybe* Ode to Joy could be argued that is was used purposefully but that would imply that Nagisa is a character.\n\nSPEAKING OF WHICH! Every single character in this show, with maybe the exception of Shinji, is borderline unbearable. (Though Toji has a little bit of character development while he isn't being completely ignored I guess.) Asuka is literally the least pleasant character in history. The writers did everything they could to stop Rei from being a character. Gendo wants to destroy humanity for poorly explained reasons, and also he's just a fucking dick-head. Misato doesn't know how to handle her fucked up \"relationship\" with her father so she resorts to alcohol and having sex whenever she decides to think at all. And every other character is given almost no time spent developing character unless it's to point out a poor relationship with their parents.\nThis show is basically just Daddy Issues and Poorly Explained Mysteries: The Show.\n\nAs the show progressed my enjoyment lessened with every episode. I would not recommend it to anyone, but everyone and their mother has already seen it so that doesn't matter.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=31,   ["text"]="                          \n    Shinseki Evangelion...the franchise has never ceased to amaze me. Abstract in meaning, never truly arriving at a concrete ending as typical of most anime, it is more a modern art rendition than an anime. Everything is up to the viewer's own interpretation, rather than a spoon fed story as of norm. Though at times the viewer may feel frustrated, at the end of it all one can feel the totality of the meaning the director wanted to convey. The main character, a typical, self loathing introvert, is more than perfect for the role, as he is more human, more self hating and misunderstood, a sterling\n          \n        example of the children of modern times. One can interpret the franchise (though it was more focused at the endings of the anime and The End) as a journey of self understanding, as a social and psychological trip to lands unknown: the hearts of others. Each character was crafted such that in their perfection they too shared the common trait of personal weakness, be it love, or trauma, or the more humane trivialities. The music utilized, at first, bizarre, was in tune with the mood of the anime, from the melodies of Bach to the catchy rhythm of J-pop of the time. Though not from the era, this viewer can feel a slight nostalgia when watching, the sounds and visuals of old overwhelming the senses, a brief flashback not of my own. The art, as expected from the era was not as stunning as modern anime series, but the Eva's designs were ahead of their time, a stark contrast to the blocky mechas of the time. The future tech as seen at the time were a picture of how the future looked like at the time. Character wise, it was refreshing to see that it lacked the overwhelming fan service of current works, and developed its characters thoroughly, showing both strengths and weaknesses, making one question the pros and cons, and even the pros and cons themselves, of each action they make.  In conclusion, if one can look past the overwhelming frustration at the story, the ever, ever, maddening actions of each character (especially Shinji) it is indeed, a work of art that leaves one satisfied. \n        "},

I understood the ending. I am very sure that I am\n          \n        not the only one that understood it and absolutely hated it.\nOh wow, it had some symbolism? Oh wow, you had to think? It must be a masterpiece! AHAHAHAH NO.\nThis feels exactly like the positive reviews of school days: Oh wow it made you feel emotion? HOW UTTERLY FANTASTIC.\nSure, it had symbolism. Sure, you had to connect concepts. Does that change the fact that it was boring as hell to watch? Does that change the fact that the story sucked? Does that change the fact that we had to sit through the same finding-yourself-through-psychotic-mumbling over and over again? Does it change the fact that we essentially sat through the \"endless 8\" arc of The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi for 26 episodes?\nThe answer: No. No it does not. \nAnd the 2deep4u ending? It is terrible. It is one of the most pathetic cop outs I've ever seen. The entirety of the anime could be summed up in that one episode were the last enemy appears, as he just conveniently and transparently explains absolutely everything through his pseudo-philosophical rantings. Yes, I understand that there were time constraints. But it doesn't change the fact that it was still terrible. It was a terrible end to a terrible anime. \nThis anime is literally only praised by people that are too enthralled in their mediocre ability to understand the simplest and most transparent of symbolism, which by the way, appears to be the only thing that they actually praise. If they praise something like character, I'm going to go ahead and say they are lying, because they character development, if you can even call it that, is the most ridiculously shallow thing I have ever witness. Makoto from school days developed more than Shinji, and Makoto is a piece of shit.\nAnd you know what? I'm usually fine with transparent symbols. Unless the only thing the anime has is these transparent symbols and attempts to purport these symbols to greatness. Symbols were the sole virtue in this anime, but they were so overly used that the end result was just awful. I actually enjoyed the 5 minute cliched fantasy world at the last episode more than the entire anime. The rebuild movies exist for a reason, people! Even the original writer hated this version!\nIf you plan on wasting 26 20-minute episodes of your life, go ahead and watch this. If you want to pretend to be smart and connect shallow symbolism to a shallow and repetitive story, go ahead and watch this. If you want to pretend that over use of symbols makes an anime a masterpiece, go right ahead and waste 520 minutes of your life.\nOtherwise, just stop.\n        "},

With some truly fantastic moments\n          \n        and interesting complex characters, the show seemed to have great potential and as the show went on I kept on getting more and more questions that seemed like they'd never get answered. But what good is the plot if the characters aren't as good? The characters of Eva are like snow:\nYou love it and can't get enough, or it annoys you and you hate it with a passion.\nWhere am i? Well I'm somewhere inbetween (Seriously fuck Asuka). Characters seemed mysterious and it felt like there was much to learn about them, but sadly the series never fully developed them as it spent a lot of time pissing around until the last 2 episodes where they realised they actually had to finish the story. \nAll in all the first 24 episodes were very entertaining and got me hyped for the hyped ending that was described to me as \"a masterpiece\", so then, how was the drop to this amazing song?\nMy reviews for episode 25 and 26:\nIT'S SHIT.\nSeriously? What the hell was that? None of my questions were answered and I'm left here confused and outraged, it's clear that the studio was running low on money because this \"ARTSY\" ending was not intended to be artsy, but just a cheap way of using whatever money they had left to conjure some terrible ending that leaves you saying \"WHAT THE HELL\"\nIs there character development? Nope!\nOnly shinji gets a bit of that!\nIs there a good story?\nNope! It's just bad\nDo you want a satisfying conclusion that leaves you with no questions?\nWell tough luck YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT\nInstead we're left with a rushed ending that obviously wasn't planned out\nThese last 2 episodes ruined the show for me.\nI hope the movies explain what the hell that was.\nEven though the ending was terrible, the show was still very enjoyable and had some terrific moments, but sadly if you want a good anime to watch that won't leave you scratching your head, I suggest you look elsewhere (Code Geass is kind of similar but SERIOUSLY BETTER).\nI had some good fun with this show and you should check it out if you want something different from the usual mecha.\nI give it an 8 out of 10"},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=31,   ["text"]="                          \n    I had an urge to write yet another review to this \"mindblowing masterpiece\" for some unknown reasons, maybe because it's been a long time since I was so dissapointed with an anime and didn't even realize what the hell is wrong with it. Maybe this'll clear my thoughts up and make you waste a couple of minutes of your life on reading. Oh yes, and pardon my English. \nNowadays when we start watching Evangelion, most of us already know what to expect - something unique, amazing, special, deep, powerful. Well, this series hasn't left any of those impressions, nor any impact on my mind and\n          \n        soul, apart from a brief suspicion that the author played magic tricks on the society and made it truly believe that this muddle has sense and meaning.\nThe story doesn't shine with singularity and isn't really that complicated. Weird monsters attack the world, and a typical japanese student with serious complexes and attention issues has to save it by piloting a giant robot. He has no desire of doing so, and doesn't really suit for the job, but who cares? That's basically it for the main story. Period. No twists, no amazing revelations, no intrigues, just some mind-digging philosophy for the rest of the show. And don't expect any interesing combat tactics or strategies, the little amount of action is easily forgettable and doesn't captivate your attention at any moment.\nThe main focus of the show are the characters, their psychology. O'kay, psychology is nice. I really love to observe how amazing, complex characters solve their problems by self-analisis and then actually DO something. Shinji, the main character of Evangelion, is a wimp, has always been a wimp and will probably stay a wimp, in spite of what he said in the finale. Yes, this is a non-typical anime character, he's realistic, not Lelouch, I get it, but I don't like it. The only worthy characters are probably Asuna and Misato, being more or less reasonable and interesting to watch. \nUntil the end the show was still promising and watchable. Its ending is truly pathetic. The main idea of the show seemed elementary and priimitive to me. As not to spoil the \"fun\", I'll stop here. \nAnd a couple of words about the supposed alternative finale, the movie, which you must watch after completing the show: more action in the beginning, and a completely muddled rot and nonsense, deeper than any ocean, in the end. \nI didn't find this mindrape enjoyable at any rate, if it provokes any feelings, those are disturbance and confusion.\nActually,at first I still gave it a 7, as an homage to it being classics and peculiar in its own weird way, and I'm not claiming that it's a bad anime. But if you're a fan of epic and dramatic shows that actually make sense and don't leave so many questions unanswered, shows like FMA, Code Geass or whatever, it's highly possible that you won't like Eva.  \nThat's it, I'm ready for your dislikes. \n"},

As in, its flaws are part of what makes it so great. \nI will start with NGE's strongest point, its characters and the character development. I believe NGE pioneered AND perfected the character development we see in many of today's anime. It is amazing to see how these teenagers change and essentially dissolve (hah, tang pun) through their interactions with their Evas and, more significantly, through their interactions with one another, which slides me nicely into the story. (Note that Rei\n          \n        doesn't really fit into this, but that's intentional because she's a...) \nThe story is just like one of the characters in that it starts with a somewhat normal, orderly shell (in this case a cliche mecha/harem anime) which starts cracking as the show gets more and more darker. In the end it shatters completely, revealing a chaotic, philosophical, and self-destructive mess. (And the movie is just chaos defined.) I thought that the ending fit really well, because it parallels the characters and makes the show much more memorable. NGE doesn't just hand you the story on a silver platter. It's subtle, and only really careful viewers would understand what the plot is about. This could be considered a flaw, but I believe this was to focus more on the amazing character development than the story development, not to mention it adds a sense of mystery throughout the show. \nThe music is great, the orchestra battle themes really set the mood, and the hauntingly beautiful opening theme song still echos in my head to this day. Also, I really love the art style, it looks great, especially for a 90s anime.\nThe reason why this is considered a classic by so many is that it deconstructs the mecha genre so well. The character, instead of being a hot-blooded badass, is a insecure character who strives for his father's praise. That's all he fights for, not to save the world, but to be accepted by others, and to have a purpose in life. In the end he realizes that relying solely on the Eva for purpose results in losing himself, since others would only recognize him for his Eva. If that's not the biggest blow to the mecha genre, I don't know what is. (Sorry if that was a spoiler, I really wanted to put that in there.)\nI think anyone who likes anime should watch this show. It just might change your life. Also, you will like the Rebuild movies much more if you watch the show and the first movie first. Just remember that it was made almost two decades ago. \n        "},

I'm extemely passionate about it that I could go on about it for hours XD. But I will try not to do that here. Neon Genesis Evangelion is a 1995 anime by Studio Gainax directed by Hideki Anno, one of the founding members of Gainax who you might not know for Nadia Secret of Blue Water and Gunbuster. With character desgins and original manga by, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto.\nI won't go into the story but I will say the series is not always for everyone and that perfectly fine. I understand that it can\n          \n        be confusing, too angsty or the characters can be too much but I don't see that. I see this as something beautifully flawed, cause it's a character piece with a lot of layers not only do  you have a mecha series , you have sci-fin elments ,a tiny bit of cosmic horror and end of the world setting. And no matter your opinion Shinji Ikari maybe the most realstic and relatable mecha hero you may come across. I hope this slightly changes your mind or convinces you if you had doubts abbout the series or you always wanted to watch it or you only seen the newer movies.

Written by Anno when he was depressed, it's no wonder the contents of this anime are absurd, chilling and downright uncomfortable.\nIt questions morals, humanity and emotions in ways that anime before hardly ever did.\nThe art and animation is some of the best, even till now.

But the way they move is amazing.\nCharacters would include the wimpy\n          \n        Shinji whose name means something like \"believe\" which is ironic, since he can't believe in himself or others at all. There's the spitfire Asuka and the emotionless Rei who are his comrades. They have very strange relationships with him. Then again, there are no \"normal\" relationships in this show.\nAll in all, this is one mind-blowing series.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=24,   ["text"]="                          \n    Let me get this out of the way: Neon Genesis Evangelion is not a bad show. However, I respect this series more for its imagination and influence rather than its execution. While the show has some good moments and has a long lasting impact, its actual quality can seem lacking compared to today's deconstructions like Digimon Tamers and Madoka Magica.\nThe characters themselves are actually good. While I think Shinji may come off as a clone of Amuro Ray, he is an actually sympathetic character who honestly reacts realistically in a terrifying situation. Likewise, Rei comes off as a likable characters who shy demeanor actually makes\n          \n        her come off as sympathetic. I know Rei is supposed to be creepy, but her cutesy vibe actually makes NERV come off as even more unlikeable for treating her like a tool. Overall the characters themselves are actually good. If they weren't, why else would we have Shinji and Rei clones like Simon, Madoka, CC, and Mikasa?\nHowever, the real problem for me is that the story exists on an entirely different dimension detached from its main characters. Even though EVA is supposed to be a character study, the story's large scale overshadows the character drama and the events seem almost unrelated to the main characters' inner angst. In other surreal dark works, the monsters and situations reflect on different aspects of the main characters. In Madoka Magica, the witches are dark corrupt mirror counterparts to the magical girls and thus have girl-related designs fitting with the whole magical girl deconstruction. Likewise, Silent Hill 2, the sexualized monsters are dark manifestations of James Sunderland's sexual libido during his search for his wife. Here, aside from a few phallic shaped angels, the Christian symbolism and angels don't really complement the characters. If the show really wanted to be about teenage coming of life story, then the villainous angels should be representations of adolescent issues like sex, academic exams, and employment.\nYet despite its problems, I'm glad EVA exists. Sure it has glaring problems and may seem amateurish compared to more modern deconstructions, it is still interesting enough to leave a real impact on pop culture. Personally, I'd say its a positive impact. It's thanks to EVA that studios are inspired to make post-modern deconstructions like Digimon Tamers, Madoka Magica, and Attack on Titan. Plus, the characters of EVA has invented new characters archetypes that I like. If EVA wasn't so interesting and unique, why would anyone try to follow in its footsteps. So while I feel EVA itself has some glaring flaws, I respect it for its uniqueness and interesting feel.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Evangelion  review \nEvangelion is a unique piece of art in the anime industry, it’s an allegory that function on 4 distinct levels. It can be enjoyed as a sci-fi adventure, it’s a bleak satire of the mecha genre, a coming of age parable and a discourse on confronting loneliness and uncertainty in the adult world. What makes it unique from other animations is the way it handles the characters and provides an insight on their inner struggles on a emotional ,psychological and subconscious level.\nThe  first thing that stands out  is the name of the show  itself which reveals its leaning towards\n          \n        religion on a thematic level. The name it’s from the Greek language meaning “Gospel of the New Genesis”, giving the audience  the perception that it’s connected to Christianity. As we go further in the story we find out  many aspects from the Kabbalah ( The Tree of Life) and Gnosticism(The fall of Sophia and her  involvement in the creation of material world symbolized by big Rei)  Door of Guf(chamber of unborn souls) from the Judaic lore who play a important role in  the lore of Evangelion.  \nThe strongest symbolism in the series is found in a common place called Nerv headquarters portrayed by the  two pyramidal architecture . It’s upright pyramid who represents the male principle and the inverse pyramid representing the female principle. In the scheme grand of things this makes sense after all the story in Evangelion culminates as Adam and Lilith come in contact with each other.\nOther noticeable thing across the series is the frequent use of the crosses . They are 5 different types used: the Latin Cross, the Greek cross ,Cross of tau ,Cross of Loraine and the inverted cross. As the director and staff stated  the crosses  don’t have a certain meaning other than for the aesthetic visuals.\nAs mentioned earlier Evangelion’s main  strong point is not in the religious symbolism and lore but  the characters. The characters relationships and interactions across the series along with the identity theme is explored making the central focus of the story in Evangelion. A natural and realistic approach in each situation is used giving the characters a tone of realism where the viewer can relate to them. On a metaphorical content it’s like a mirror where the audience notices his past mistakes and interactions that made their identity as a individual .\nThe characters in Evangelion can’t be described by simple words , the anime explores all their inner struggles and interactions with other people on a psychological level , physical level and emotional level using different metaphors , moral,  famous philosophy lines and through their fights with the angels by piloting the Eva units.\nThe identity of each character is questioned across the series using different methods and style of approach . For our 3 main characters Rei, Asuka and Shinji they must fight the angels in the Eva units portraying their fear , courage and psychological breakdown . This helps with  their characterization but this is just a small part of what Evangelion offers to it’s audience. \nWe deep further into the human interactions and relationships , and the anime questions the moral break line between Misato and Shinji as mother and son always going from a sexual approach to a family one. This is the result of Misato’s psychological mental state and past trauma where she lingers for her father .\nWe have Ritsuko who never found affection from her mother  and she always finds comfort in the arms of Ikari Gendo letting him used her as he pleases. The story progresses and the morals turn into a philosophy lesson about children who hate their own parents but subconsciously follow in their footsteps and work. \nAs opening every door to a room the characterization goes deep for each character and we are presented their past trauma , fears, hatred until we reach the last room the most deep and terrifying memory that leads to their mental breakdown.\nEvangelion is again a unique show because of its main character Shinji. Imbued with many character  flaws that prove his undoing, he is the opposite of the idealistic heroes . While a idealistic hero is what many of us aspire to be , Shinji is the representative of the audience realizations , the flaws we recognized in ourselves. A fascinating concept that Evangelion uses is the A.T. field or absolute terror field. The AT Field is a beautiful metaphor because it taps into something very real. We all put up walls around our emotions, it’s the only way to guard yourself from the hurt out there in the world. You have to steel yourself to survive in a world where people aren’t always nice, and don’t always care what you feel.\nWhat makes this show a true epitome  that stands above all anime is the two different endings that our main character Shinji experience. In the tv series he is questioned about his identity and finds what he lacks and overcomes his fear of being hated and hurt by others through a positive psychological breakdown during the Instrumentality project. He ends up in the center of a crowd with a smile on his face in a row of applause accepting the Instrumentaly project . In the Eoe movie he is put through a lot of pain and traumatic past experiences and ends up rejecting the Instrumentality project. All is well portrayed with the apocalyptic scenery around him and the last scene where he chokes Asuka.\nEvangelion is an anime that every detail and aspects is used to portray the human race . From the eva units who are made to look closer to the humans having different symbolic characteristics similar to us like the Entry plug(throne of the soul) umbilical cord  and the A.T field to the fight with the angels. Each encounter reveals more about the angels and the way they adapt to understand our human mind and heart until the last one who takes a human form. \nAnother reference would be the two seeds that created life on earth Adam(progenitor for angels the white moon) and Lilith(progenitor of humans the black moon) . All of these aspects and references are used for the foundation of the plot and exploring the themes in Evangelion thus leading to the fabulous characterization and human relationships interactions provided for the story to its audience. \nA masterpiece of the 90’s that lead to many discussions in different domains including the academic ones after it’s release in Japan and started many religious controverse across the sea "},

Well, no, it's not. Though I like the Evangelion series, I never thought it was great, much less a masterpiece. Allow me to explain why before you shout \"Blasphemy! Blasphemy!\". \nFirstly, Shinji. I get that he's supposed to be a deconstruction of the fictional hero stereotype but this is rubbed at the audience for so long that it becomes irritating. The series' constant ramblings on the philosophical nature of\n          \n        his character and examination on his cowardice makes it work almost like a documentary and completely wipes away the focus on the rest of the characters and subplots. \nSecond, its symbolism. Evangelion was also heavily praised for having deep, underlying ideas and Christian symbolism to make it stand out from the rest of the mecha schlock coming out at the time. Hard to say this, but I was hardly convinced. Many of the series' themes, while explored to a certain depth, felt pretty shallow. It was easy to spot what certain scenes were trying to do and one or two skip backs to catch on with what was being explored exactly which never felt challenging to me. The Christian symbolism has a share of this as well. What, did they think I wouldn't notice the huge-ass cross explosions or the fact that the First Angel's name was Adam? Let me clarify. Being a Catholic who's studied a good bit of theology, I will say, I expected a lot from this. While people say it is open to interpretation, I couldn't help but feel restricted to too few ideas. The imagery was plenty quick-to-the-point and always felt served on a silver platter. Whatever the case, the thematic approach of EVA felt weak, like an allegory without all the good things about an allegory. (They did it way better in The End so I'll give it that).\nThird, everything else. Thanks to the show's \"I want someone\" philosophical exploration and imagery yanking screen time off the show, everything else felt underdeveloped. While the series does try to squeeze in some history and secondary character time, they're never explored thoroughly (Again, thanks to Shinji's moping). It's almost like the rest of the cast exist to push Shinji to do better and congratulate him for it at the end. ... (Oh wait). While there was effort to keep these characters and subplots relevant to the series (particularly, Asuka and Rei), it only really hung on by a thread. And how did they make up for this? By converting the show into 26 minute therapy sessions. There's nothing inherently wrong with this but good god, you could've found a better way? The transition felt awkward and while many say this improved the series, I would think this as a step down. \nNow let's go to the good things about the series. Evangelion is a mecha series that goes to go the distance with pretty good storytelling. While I had a few problems with the execution, (Leaving then coming back. Make up your mind, Shinji)(Deus Ex Misato Plane Catch)(Asuka) the rest made up for those, nonetheless. The characters were a blast and I can see the appeal, despite the lacking characterization. The action itself was intense and the military-style combat made for some intense  sequences. And how can I talk about EVA without mentioning THAT FUCKING OPENING. I sing it to school two times a day. At most, five. \nEvangelion is a series that harbors different views and mine is no different from those. While it is one of the hallmarks of the anime industry I found undeserving of the title, it was a good watch nonetheless, despite its often times shallow themes and symbolism, sometimes sloppy writing and underdeveloped characters. It's an easy recommendation and while this series may not be for me, I'm sure it will leave some sort of Impact on someone else.\n"},

Why you select teenagers to fight these Angels? I get that people who are 18 or up can have permission to fight overseas but then again, with me being in the Western part of the world, there are different standards and traditions around the world after all but like\n          \n        a crime procedural, there are about 16 (well, 17) angels to battle in most of the episodes and it’s kind of the monster-of-the-week show while we get into more of the character development, and speaking of the characters……….\n\n\n\nThe likability of the characters in the show averages to “they are decent characters” and “somebody, please, slap one of them”. Meet Shinji Ikari, the main character (or the Third Child) and pilot of the EVA Unit 01, although it’s not like he wanted the job, his father Gendo Ikari forces him to do it. Yeah, Shinji was some major daddy issues considering that he was abandoned as a toddler and a motherless child. I wanted to think that there were some similarities between him and Tidus from Final Fantasy X, but Shinji wasn’t that annoying, although if I hear, “I mustn’t run away!! “I mustn’t run away!! “I mustn’t run away!!” I swear I will throttle him but this isn’t the worst phrase I heard. Shinji tries to develop himself to speak up more, be more confident, and man up but that just goes nowhere and that can become very annoying.\n\nRei Ayanamiis the First Child and the pilot of the Unit 00. Rei, to me, is a neutral character to deal with. She is an introvert and impersonal, with Gendo Ikari being the closest person she ever contacted with. However, she is, in fact, a doll as clones of her were developed in case she dies and her soul is transferred to another body. Rei is seemingly the only one who does keep her cool at a few times, but here is a few warnings for my description of the next character: If you happen to like this character, you might hate me or just respectfully disagree with me and that is………. Asuka Langley Soryu and she are the Second Child & the pilot of Unit 02 and also, my least favorite character of the show. But why is she? It is because she’s brash? No. Sometimes she can tell the harsh truth that needed to be told. It is because of her verbal abuse to everyone she meet? Mostly, but not because of Shinji, he might have had it coming. But she is just a capital B-I-T-C-H! Yes, sometimes bitchy characters who act like that for the sake of acting bitchy annoys the hell out of me and maybe she doesn’t do that all the time but with her, you just want to--- you know what, I’m not like that. I don’t believe in violence against women at all and I hope that did not send you the wrong message of me.\n\nMisato Katsuragi is the chief operations officer of Nerv. She is a more flawed character throughout in the later episodes and yet, this is my favorite character of the show.  How she was brought up is an example; when she was 14, she has gotten seriously injured as the Second Impact was beginning. She survived the Katsuragi Expedition, but her father did not.  She also plays the role of guardian for both the whining angsty little bi—I mean, Shinji & Asuka and she has a penguin!!! YAY Penguins!! Wait………a penguin……..that she keep by giving it the fridge for a room. Well, at least, she didn’t order a gaggle full of penguins (unlike a certain Mr. Jim Carrey) and the fact she gets really drunk and is a slob off-duty. Yeah, despite all of that, I still like her. Also other characters include the head scientist of Nerv, Ritsuko Akagi, who are aware of the Evangelion’s true nature, friends with Misato (but they often argue many times) and Ryoji Kaji, who is Misato’s ex and a triple agent investigating Nerv for the Japanese Government. Also there is the classmates Toji Suzuhara, Kensuke Aida & Hikari Horaki, two of the former are friends with Shinji (they aren’t that important) and the latter is Asuka’s only friend (Gee, I wonder why? Yeah, I know why. They’re both [bleep].)\n\nAs I explained earlier, the show has a lot of influential themes and symbolism (mainly Christian & Kabbalistic), such as philosophy, military, biological, psychology, religion, Buddhist beliefs, and the Japanese otaku subculture with creator Hideaki Anno’s own experience with clinical depression at the time.\n\nMany examples that some of the characters are named after Japanese WWII warships and such as the two non-important supporting characters I previously mentioned named after the protagonists of Ryu Murakami’s Ai to Genso no Fascism. Many of the characters suffer from deep psychological traumas connected to their loved ones (a la Shinji, Asuka, Misato, Ritsuko) but some of those themes and symbolism does get shoved in there, especially the final 2 episodes and mostly it gets garbled trying to understand it all and if you’re really on an intellectual level that above me, hopefully you can understand it better than me. Most of the time, the angst levels of the characters go so high, you swear you are watching an annoying teen soap. It’s not up to emo levels but Shinji is that one character who really never gets the whole situation. Well, as much as my disdain for Asuka, Shinji never even bother to improve on himself and it gets very forgetful if not.\nAfter those two final episodes, that was a movie called The End of Evangelion to recreate a more detailed ending to replace it and then there is The Rebuild of Evangelion, where just the re-tooling is or completely new version of NGE. I don’t know if that is just milking the franchise so much, soon people will just grew tired and irritated and send death threats to the creator and trash the studio---Oh wait, that did happen. It may have worked on most franchises but some of them have different storylines and characters.\n\nIn other terms, the animation does show its age (made over 17 years ago) and great for its time and for most mecha shows, it didn’t feel that generic. The music…….Yes, I love the opening theme song “A Cruel Angel’s Thesis”, which is very energetic and the score is passable, too, with the action and dramatic themes and how many versions of “Fly Me to the Moon” are there or at least covered by many artists at the time? 31. There are thirty-one versions of that song in the franchise itself.  I can’t say which one I like the most considering that there are even more versions of that song.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: This is one of the most confusing, mind-boggling, intriguing, love-hating, and nerve-racking and one of those anime that you have to watch in order to understand the form of it more. The themes can be very interesting at best but it can soon sound mostly contrived.  The characters are slightly average with people that you like, feel neutral about, or just loathe. The themes get rattled once you watched it. But the problem with it is that it’s just so pretentious, it wants the audience to understand the philosophical ideals but the show has a hard time trying to explain it on time. It doesn’t have to be a long explanation of clunky and disjointed dialogue but for what it does in the earlier episodes, it’s enjoyable to watch.\n"},

Every so often, Angels, giant celestial monsters from beyond, decide to wreak havoc on the surface, each attempting to start the next impact, and likely the end of the world. It’s clearly a problem for Earth’s inhabitants, so they’ve established a military organization named NERV for the specific purpose of fending off the Angels. Our fourteen year old protagonist, Shinji Ikari, is invited by his father and commander (Gendo Ikari) to join NERV in the city of Tokyo-3 (the last two were blown up\n          \n        it seems). It just so happens that Shinji is the one who gets to do the heavy lifting (see: fighting monsters), via a giant mech suit called an Evangelion. Go ahead and watch those too if you are able.\nIt appears to be pretty standard fare upon first glance: Shinji meets his robot, beats the bad guys, and will clearly save the world, but that’s not where the show went, and the direction it took with the plot was what made the series so endearing and influential on the Anime Industry.\nYou see, this story is one of its characters. Shinji, and many of those closer to him, are subjected to an intense psychological gauntlet of events over the course of the series. Every person of note has some serious flaws, and they maintain and nurture these flaws rather than having them ironed out, as is the typical pattern in many stories. Occasionally, during moments of strength and courage, Shinji will make a stand and confront his fear of close relationships. As he jumps a hurdle, he’ll smack into the 10-foot brick wall that is his true nature. He’ll brood over why he pilots his Eva unit, why he even bothered to make contact with his rather indifferent father, or the fact that he even deals with people in general. The rest of the cast is just as interesting to watch: Asuka’s independent and perhaps sadistic nature makes her a both hilarious and painful character to watch. Rei’s closure from the world makes her both a mystery to the audience as well as a subject of empathy. The best parts of the show occur when all three of these characters are interacting together, as the chemistry between them is both unpleasant and volatile. Again: It’s a character study. A character study with GIANT ROBOTS. Unfortunately, not all is good with a critically acclaimed series. Shinji is famous for sounding like a whiny bitch at times, and not without due credit. Gendo Ikari is really just an asshole, and the lack of ballsack on nearly every character is frustrating to watch at times.\nVisually, this anime holds up well. The animations are a little jerky compared to modern animation, but the character designs (count the amount of times I say character) are clean and easily discernable. The unique, organic-yet-mechanical look of the Eva units making a lasting impression on viewers. Still rather disturbing on several levels are the angels, with their otherworldly appearances bordering on the edges of Judeo-Christian aesthetic (I still don’t understand the inclusion – Lots of explosions are portrayed as bright crosses of light jutting from the Earth’s surface)). The action’s no slouch, and combined with the fantastic scene direction, makes for some wonderfully awesome scenes; The first battle where Eva Unit 01 goes berserk stays in the memory of even the passing fans. Opening up a can of unnatural whoop ass tends to do that. One thing of note: The animation studio, Gainax, began to run out of animation budget towards the end of the series, leading up to what is perhaps one of the most controversial endings the history of the entertainment medium. It left fans with a very bitter taste in their mouths, and led to the creation of two movies in an attempt to patch up the ending: Death and Rebirth and End of Evangelion.\nAnyways, I’ve mentioned before that Neon Genesis Evangelion was a darling to the anime industry. I’m not kidding, either. It is, quite literally, the series that made North America pay attention to this new Japanese fad; made famous because of the mature issues that it addressed, unlike the other shows grouped with it during that time. If you are a newcomer to this sort of thing, or are a fellow anime fan who has managed to miss this work, I highly recommend it to you.\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    This review contains spoilers for the TV series and the 1997 Movie End of Evangelion.\nEvangelion, if an experienced anime fan hear this name alone, they'll probably be reminded instantly to the two great dichotomous opinions in which, one side will praised it as a classical masterpiece while as for the others, will hate it as well as claiming for it to be one of the worst and most overrated anime ever made. Thankfully enough, I was on quite minority of these two polarizing opinions. I have some elements from the franchise in which I liked, as well as some in which I despised. I think\n          \n        that would made me as a minority in which belongs to none of these groupies. Based upon the 30 anime critics votes on shinchosha, Neon Genesis Evangelion has been placed on #1, with the total of 14 votes on it. But as an audience whose also tend to criticise the work of fiction that I consume, I have to disagree.\nFor me, Neon Genesis Evangelion plot is akin to the void of creativity. Yes, as I've stated before, I have received that bit of information about the franchise in which it's a character driven story, but I have never once expected that the plot progressions to be so tedious that it almost sleep inducing. It's an irony if these statement has to be said for an fiction in which includes action, for the purpose of actions is to induce an adrenaline rush to the audiences. Almost every angels fights can be simplified to be look like this scenario:\n1. An Angel appeared, there will be someone who said the probability chance of winning is 0.01% or something extremely low.\n2. The teens will get into the robot, fought the angels without much briefing, went overwhelmed, and took a temporary retreat.\n3. They changed the strategies on their headquarters, and took plan b.\n4. They went with the plan, and succeeded. Either it be a flawless victory or just simply unit 01 went berserk, and destroyed the angel.\nNever once there's serious injuries within every fights, let alone casualties. The constant abuse of extremely low success rate information in conjunction with the almost nonexistent physical damage within the pilots is more than just breaking one's suspension of disbelief. It's predictablility can only be rivaled by Revolutionary Girl Utena, in which is safe to say that the work have recycled the same scenes during the duels. It went even more ridiculous during one of the last fight that there's a huge explosions that could easily nuked a complex of skyscrapers but Rei Ayanami, the pilot of the said robot who have sustained the fatal damage, only received minor injuries. Predictable-ness is the most hated elements that I have to experience in the work of fiction, moreso than deus ex-machina , asspulls, or unreasonable shock factor. The same tricks won't work for more than three times, moreover it it was abused ad nauseum. Keep in mind that I also have a severe disdain for the mundane and chore aspects of life, as my personality type belongs to the one who craves for the unknown sensation. But still, I've tried really hard to just embrace it, and I could appreciate many slice of life such as K-ON, Aria, Honey and Clover, and many others, which is the proof that I too can feel the \"beauty in the mundane\". But this was a sensation I unable to found on Neon Genesis Evangelion. The notion of life-risking task of destroying the angels to ensure humanity's civilization is too grand to be called those of a mundane. However, it's really mundane if seen from the audience perspective, all thanks to what I said before. One of my favorite works Dies Irae have its share amount of predictability but in the end, it gave a satisfying reason as well as how it correlates with the subtext of it, but I found no underlying reason for the fights to be so predictable and tedious. The plot twist that's explained on the backstory wasn't that phenomenal either. As for why this SEELE organizations wanted to converge the whose earth into a single entity, it's never been explored further. They just wanted it because they thought that it's good like a group of an antisocial people they are. And yes, it's an oxymoron and rather slightly contradictory and really unsatisfactory as well.\nTis really unfair to speak about Neon Genesis Evangelion without giving a proper discourse about the infamous protagonist Shinji Ikari. Shinji is the main underlying cause Neon Genesis Evangelion has garnered so much praise as well as hate. Many of the haters despised him due to the fact that he was too much of a cowardly whiner who doesn't want to get into the robot in their eyes, while the fans found his demeanor to be relatable, as Shinji has to deal with a parental issues in which his perfectionist father Gendo Ikari objectified him with a little to none sense of fatherly kindness. What's worse is that Shinji have witnessed the incident in which took her mother's life due to Gendo's experiments as a kid. One would've have a hard time trusting such person. My own opinion towards Shinji is actually rather positive. I found his demeanor to be believable, but have I myself been put on his position, I'd certainly piloting the robot without complaining, despite my hatred towards my supposed father Gendo. I do realized if piloting a robot against a powerful alien creature was by no means an easy task, but I also do realized as well that if I don't get to the robot, then the world, all the human civilization that has been built since the stone age until that year of 2015, would be clobbered into oblivion. If I get into the robot, I still have a chance to be the humanity's last glimmer of hope and might came out alive. Whereof I choose not to, all that hope is lost, I will experienced a certain death. It's quite obvious to me the choice I have to pick in between the 0.01% chance to survive and the 0% one. But Shinji has his own reasons to not pilot the robot, in which albeit I have to disagree with him, I respect it. Shinji could care less about others necessities, and his thoughts process is so internalized that he could only thought of a gentle, parental care and neglects almost every other issues of life in which led to what the show called as \"The Hedgehogs Dilemma\". The Hedgehog's dilemma the term in which rather frequently referenced in the anime to describe Shinji's state. Much alike Hedgehog's dilemma, Shinji craved for a soothing warmth of kindness and care, but his disobedience attitude as shown to his frequent rejection to ride the robot as well as how he made the decision of destroying the 4th angel despite the robot critical state instead of retreating as commanded by his superior Misato Katsuragi, is akin to the hedgehog's spikes, in which distanced him from the other person in his relationship and therefore, the warmth he wished for. I found that almost every aspects of Shinji's character to be believable, and that he himself is not presented as a boring protagonist. His internal struggles are showed frame-to-frame throughout the series that it's most definitely Neon Genesis Evangelion charm to it's fans. The final growth of his character is great, in which basically he decided to throw away all of his 'spikes' by took the decision to care about others necessities, as well as loving himself more in result. These moments, for those who relate on a personal level to Shinji since the beginning of the show, might've struck them so hard it speaks directly to them as the solution of their own biggest life issues that it's almost autobiographically written by a certain someone who have experienced such issues, and have win against his inner conflicts by removing his \"spikes\".\nHowever, despite my heavy praise towards Shinji's character writing, I have one issue with him, and that is about his relationship with Kaworu Nagisa. So Kaworu is supposed to be a person that's being sent in order to replace a certain someone in which are too mentally damaged to pilot the robot. He appeared way late on around episode 23, and have stated that he might have been born just to met with Shinji, care to him, and showed it by some bit of gentleness. However, in episode 24, it's been revealed that he's actually the last angel Shinji has to slay, and that he controlled unit 02 as his defense in order to get to the central dogma, achieving his purpose as an angel. Shinji have a huge conflict whether he has to kill Kaworu or not, and it has around 1 minute of still image alone for these scene accompanied with classical music piece being played, in order to emphasize his inner conflicts. I found this conflicts to be unreasonble. As a person have rejected all the people he know and deemed them to be an non-understanding nuisances, he should've developed a paranoia in which he won't trust anyone so easily anymore. However, he developed these trust to Kaworu almost right instant the moment Kaworu stated he was born to met him and shares room with him, in which can be said it's pretty much less than a week. Kaworu's appearance himself is pretty dubious, as he have an unusually red eye, in which none other of the casts possess with the exception of Rei Ayanami, in which demeanor herself was mysterious and by that time, has been proven than she's a clone of her mother spliced with some gene of the angel's progenitor. The fact that Shinji never become suspicious with Kaworu, and trusted him in such a short time, while even rejected Misato's love in which akin to a boss love to their employers love that's been there for longer, bugs me a lot. But despite these minor issues of mine, I still think he's a great character in which carried the shows as well as ithe whole Hedgehog dilemma thing.\nRei Ayanami is another interesting main character. One of the point of her characterization is that she is supposed to be how the writer thinks of how a \"kuudere\", an anime tropes anime fans often praised and think as an ideal wife, looks like with a justification. The writer apparently believes that such thing doesn't exists and if it is, they're just an emotionless clone, unable to breed?. But still in the end, despite being a clone, Rei also develops, proving that she still retain some of her human senses and that even clones would at times stopped being such archetypes. Rei, due to her unfamiliarity with the many common sense, just accepted the given fact that she's a robot pilot who have to fight against the angels. In which in return, she gained the warmth Shinji craved for, despite not actually demanding for it. This also make growth of her affection towards Gendo as a good fatherly figure, in which the reason Rei got angry when Shinji outright stated he hated his father during some scene and slapped him. Her development with Shinji is also nice. However, her development in Neon Genesis Evangelion is rather unsatisfactory is her last scene is where he helped Shinji a bit in his fight with Kaworu, proving that she also has an AT Field like every other angels, and that's it. She only appeared again in the last 2 episodes in which basically the narrative summary of the characters conflicts throughout the prior 24 episodes and Shinji's finale.\nI really wanted to skip this part if I can but due to the fact that she has many fans around the anime community and that she's also one of the main character as well, here I am, I have to speak out about my opinion towards Asuka Langley Soryu, in which name I haven't spoken up until this moment. I've done a lot of things in order to add to Asuka's hate train, whether it be ranting everywhere on the anime forums, memeing her name, and many others. Now it's time to finish this once and for all. Asuka, in a single line, can be described as a character in which purpose just like Rei, but for \"tsundere\", another trope which garnered a lot of fan within the anime community. In simple, Asuka is an arrogant, incompetent, and thinks that she's better than other pilots. These traits alone is enough to made me despised her to the point that if I have met someone as such in my life, I'll have a deadwish for her. She never have the ability to solo even one angel, so please, refrain from calling her talented, because she's not. In addition, removing her from the franchise will not hinders the plot progressions, because Shinji will still be able to solo all the angels via unit-01 berserk button. Most of the Asuka's fan will call \"realistic or relatable\" in defense of her. Some will also mentioned her justification of these obnoxious attitude in which is her backstory. But I have to say right here, right now, thar such person doesn't deserve sympathy in the slightest. If one have mentioned Asuka to be \"realistic\", have people imagined what Asuka is in our very real life? An arrogant, insecure person who wanted people to accept her superiority while in fact is an incompetent loser, I can't think more better description to suits a group of person we refer as Feminazi/SJW/Alt-right, in which they're all only loved and sympathized by those who belongs to their own group. Interestingly enough, they're most likely to also have a parental issue as well, but still many people have the opinion that they're actually a cancer, scum of the community. So if one said that they relate to Asuka, sorry, bit I already have a bad image of what you looks like in real life. And moreover, if you stated that you hated feminazi/SJW/alt-right and also a huge fan of Asuka, I call hypocrisy. Lastly, my favorite Asuka moment in Neon Genesis Evangelion is the moment when she got mentally attacked by the angels within the space. The moment she screamed in agony and how the sound wave based attack that sounds of \"Hallelujah!\" made it looks loke as if she's a devil in which being exorcised by an angel (wow, I made a pun). His relationship with Shinji is just like what you're expected, which is they can barely get along well. Asuka herself is also a hedgehog's dilemma carrier afterall. Unrelated, I think that Anno is rather uncreative in creating a diverse backstory because the two characters that steal the most performance has a nearly identical past, in which is father negligence and objectification accompanied with death of mother. She's a nicely written character, but meant not to be sympathized moreover related.\nMy favorite character of the show, Misato Katsuragi, served as the commander of the teen robot pilots. She's caring, but values discipline much to Shinji's disdain. Shinji was unable to realized her love due to the fact that she delivers it not in the way he wanted to. His relationship with the teen pilot is akin to those of seniors/boss to juniors/employers, in which I found her to possess the most likable traits. However, she is not a woman without issues. She's (again) losing one of his parents due to research in which happens years prior to the events of the story and thus, sought after a fatherly figure to cope with her loneliness. She tried it by dating a guy called Kaji Ryoji, but ended up having broke up some time after they have love together. I like her because despite being disciplined, she's really kind and caring, the trait every main character of Neon Genesis Evangelion craved for, yet having issues to get one.\nGendo Ikari is also necessary to be shortly discussed about, since he's the father of the protagonist. I found that it's rather poorly explored on why Gendo have little to none sense of caring towards his very own son, Shinji Ikari. His reasoning as a NERV supreme leader for instrumentality is more justifiable that seele's reason of instrumentality, in which that he wanted to be with his wife Yui Ikari out of the grasp of the SEELE.\nThe End of Evangelion is a movie in which made 2 years after the making of the TV series to remake the last two episodes due to the originals are made in lack of budgets and time. For the movie, I found that Rei's finale to be satisfying. She finally made her own deicision after seeing the big picture from all the sides, unbiased to her felt of father towards Gendo nor her sympathy towards Shinji, to enact the Instrumentality Project and let Shinji decided whether such world was an ideal world he wished for, or not. After receiving a dying kiss from Misato, Shinji finally gains the courage to get in the robot and thus begans the instrumentality. Based on what he wished for, it's seemingly will be an ideal world for him, where every human being is a single entity so that everyone could understand and therefore caring to him. But after what Rei suggest, Shinji finally realized that things aren't supposed to be happening the way that be. Humans socializes. Even when sometimes you get hurt by what people said, it's still better, more beautiful than if one not socialize at all. In fact, you are also shaped by how the way the society views you (the theory of collective consciousness). It's a great theme being tackled, but at this point it's basically pointless to reject the instrumentality. For the whole world has been turned to a sea of tang like substance called as the LCL. Also, there's no other inhabitants left on the Earth, in which means that you'll still be a lone, unsocial creature. The remnants of the TV series in which his reaction towards Kaworu that sets his early state in the movie still bothers me too. Asuka however, still the same as ever. She attacked the angels like a rampaging beast, but failed miserably. Even in the end, she's still as obnoxious as the way she is in the beginning. And the end scene showed that Asuka also be another person who survived the instrumentality, and that Shinji accepted Asuka. Okay I get the subtext that you should blend yourself with the society instead of being a demanding creature who seeks for others attention amd warmth towards you without even trying to brought warmth to others as a first move, but I believe that there's a limit to everything. Will you still accept a degenerate feminazi/SJW/alt-right that only causes burden into your life? Sorry but, I won't. This is the main reason on why I despised the movie.\nNow finally, there's one last thing I need to put in discourse and it's regarding the anti-escapism subtext, in which these show is rather blatant on it, notably Neon Genesis Evangelion. I have to say that the way it presented the subtext is highly disagreeable. The anime treated as if escapism at its slightest bit is wrong, and ridiculously mocked every attempts of it, such as making Asuka as hateable and degenerate as possible, taking a peek for thousand of other Yui Ikari's clones before finally dismantled all of them as if they're a pile of junk, and many other scene I won't mention one by one that makes sure the watcher thinks if these anime tropes are all bad escapism. To be fair it's not only a generalization of all anime watchers are perceived as a bad escapist who should feel bad, but also disrespectful to the trope itself.Now my personal philosophy is that escapism itself is also a rather bad thing, but at times, you need it. For instance, when I have finished my nightshift and wanted some good, nice battle ecchi anime before I sleep, and I laughed to it, it actually safe to say that it's an essential refreshment for my busy life. As for anime \"archetype\" such as \"kuudere\", \"tsundere\", or many others (I'm not a fan of them but I can tolerate people who love them), Neon Genesis Evangelion have torn the image of it, but I too have to disagree with the notion of said things are unreal and can't be good. For instance, if you're rich enough, you can just go to the tsundere/kuudere maid cafe and enjoy the waitresses roleplaying as one. Asking your couple to roleplay as one isn't a no-go either. It's so one-sided that it feels like a blind hate speech to the medium tropes.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that Neon Genesis Evangelion has a noticably great themes and characters, but the falls flat in the plot deivison, it's so generic and tedious that it's hurting to be able to predict on what happened during the fights that it's almost safe to tell that it's skippable and its anti-escapism subtext is insulting. But still I have to say, Evangelion is a must-watch. The audience will find out that they'll be either loved it to death, hated it to death, or become a small minority like I am to think that it's just an average show that gained popularity. I regrettably must admit that I skipped some of the topics in which have been discussed a lot about around the internet and just glossed over it, but hopefully, my simple bit of writing have brought a new light about my thoughts on the series, as well as expanding yours. Thank you for reading.\nSidenote: I found it rather ironic whenever I see an \"elitist\" Evangelion fan. The TV series stated that for your craving for warmth to be fulfilled, you must remove your \"spikes\", and elitism is one of them. I really wonder whether these \"elitist\" fans get through the subtext or not.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="                          \n    Evangelion is truly a unique experience. Everyone has their own thoughts on it, and its level of influence makes it something that should be watched at some point by anyone that wants to get into anime. Whether you regard it as a masterpiece or a disaster, it's certainly worth your time.\nUnfortunately, I can't agree with either side, and now I sit in the uncomfortable middle seat in this awkward mech ride. Evangelion is by no means a bad anime, but there are many things that kept me from enjoying it, whether it was personal tastes or just flat-out questionable ideas.\nWhen coming into this, I already\n          \n        understood that this was about some wimpy kid named Shinji who cries a lot and pilots a mech thing. Evangelion delivers. Great job, everyone. Though I didn't particularly like Shinji as a character, I could understand his feelings; why he's upset, why he's a loner, all that shit, so that's fine. What I DON'T understand how everyone does a shit job at helping him. Particularly in the case of Gendou, Shinji's father, everyone is reluctant or even annoyed and angered with Shinji because he doesn't want to be forced into his position, as he puts it, to the point where they even accept his leave. Isn't this kid, like, super important? Isn't he the only person who can pilot Unit 01? The least you could do is pretend to like him (which could even lead to some more character drama down the line) or get a therapist to talk to him. I don't even understand how Shinji and the other kids are the only pilots anyway; teenagers and their crazy hormones would seem like some of the worst kinds of people for a military operation, but they aren't when you need your anime to appeal to teenagers!\nThat's kinda like the other thing with Evangelion that I disliked: how little I knew about everything, particularly with the Evas and Angels. Now, I'm not saying that they should dump every bit of info at me in the first episode or I'll rate it a 1/10; in fact, making it evident something is not good but holding most information from the audience would be best and make that reveal more interesting, but the only time anyone even wondered what these things were was around the middle of the show, and it was just a carefree question. Otherwise, everyone just seems to go along with this whole questionable scenario. And even when we DO get answers, they're mostly vague because Evangelion prefers to be deep and symbolic. I could look up all this imagery and symbolism and shit... if I actually cared enough? Being direct is what I want in a story, and I'll only look into the hidden details if I'm actually interested in it. I don't want to look at everything with a magnifying glass to understand the basics. But if that's the kind of art you're into, this show will be right up your alley.\nWhat I also disliked is that EvanJellyMan seemed unsure of what it wanted to be more: a psychological anime, or a sci-fi/action anime. The start of the anime balances these two elements pretty nicely, but after a few episodes there's very little of the psychological elements because reasons, and the show goes into \"monster of the week\" mode, where every episode for a while is just about a new Angel appearing and the kids needing to stop it. As an action anime, this is somewhat okay because of the interesting fights, but it slows the overall narrative a great deal. The absolutely atrocious ending is another example of this imbalance by being only half of an ending, and... well, I'll get there later. Either of these themes could've worked on their own and made for a 13-episode anime instead, but instead they were combined and got messy at times. I'm not against the idea of an action show like this mixed with some psychological drama, though.\nThis paragraph is a little spoilery, so skip to the next if you want. The story could be good even beyond those gripes, but the ending will prevent it from ever being good. It is probably the worst ending I've ever experienced in any medium. Fucking Tetris has a better ending than this shit. Well maybe not, but anyway, this is just half of an ending at best. It simply gives Shinji's internal character some resoultion while the show LITERALLY says \"we don't have enough time to explain the rest.\" Never mind that the show wastes a handful of minutes by prolonging scenes as long as possible because the budget eventually ran out. Forget about symbolism or anything; it's one thing to have an ambiguous ending, and it's another to have absolutely no ending at all.\nBeyond the bad ending, unbalance of themes, and some lack of details, the story is pretty basic, but passable enough.\nEvangelion isn't more focused on its story, though; rather it's more interested in selling its characters, which it does only decently. Shinji is an alright character; he's very boring when he's not depressed, but this is actually okay since Shinji's supposed to be the normalfag who shouldn't be thrust into extraordinary situations like this anyway. Still, there were a couple things that I disliked about him that I'll put below this paragraph, because they're spoilers. Misato is pretty good because of her relationship with Shinji, as well as the drama caused by her past and relationships with others. Unfortunately, that's basically the end of the supposedly amazing cast of Evangelion, as the other characters are basically... well, basic; or at least not interesting or unique enough to stand out. Asuka doesn't fall into either of these categories, but I personally disliked how much of a bitch this character is in pretty much every scene. She's a similar, but opposite character to Shinji: instead of being emotional and not wanting to pilot the Eva, she's emotional and wants to pilot the Eva, at least whenever it's convenient for her. God forbid she has to wear a marshmallow suit or cooperate with someone she doesn't like when she's, you know, saving the world or something. And then everyone in authority just kinda goes along with her bitching. Okay. At least they treat her better than Shinji???\nSpoilery part about Shinji: In episode 4, Shinji quits being a pilot entirely and begins to leave home, but at the last moment, he backs out and goes back to being a pilot. They don't say why he makes this choice, he just... kinda... does. Much later, towards the end of the show, he meets a character named Kaworu, becomes friends with him, and then kills him... in one episode. And he's upset about this. REALLY upset. For fuck's sake, man, I'm the one who should be upset here. I'm the one who had to sit through that absolute masterpiece of a scene. Probably the funniest part is that this guy is on the promotional poster. I'm really not sure what was going on with this whole thing, but I also just wanna let it go because this is basically the last thing that actually happens in the show.\nI think I've said all I want to say about the story and characters and all, so I'll just talk about the actual production.\nEspecially given its time, the art of Evangelion is quite good. On a basic level, the character designs are outstanding--yeah, OUTSTANDING, and that includes the designs of both the mechs and the very odd-but-not-silly Angels. Beyond the actual designs, the animation holds up pretty well. The key problem is that many scenes will drag on and on with little-to-no animation required because budget. However, I won't pin this on the art itself and just the overall direction of the anime... it still looks good in the end.\nThe soundtrack is okay, but it's very repetitive. It's always the same song for an Angel attack, for breakfast at Misato's, and probably some others that I didn't really point out. Nothing in the OST really stands out but it can at least get the job done. Eva's real claim to fame is the opening theme, 'A Cruel Angel's Thesis', which is considered by pretty much anyone that takes opening songs seriously to be one of the best ever... and they're absolutely right. It might not exactly fit the mood of the anime very well, but at the end of the day, it's a damn good song that will cling to your memory for quite some time.\nTo close with, I didn't really hate Evangelion, and I'm glad I watched it, but I would've also avoided it if it weren't for its legacy. The blend of its elements are what make it stand out, but I didn't think it did anything particularly well. The psychological stuff is shadowed by an overall weak supporting cast, the sci-fi is more about imagery and not actual science, and the action will be broken up by these things. I'd still recommend that most people watch it, though, as you'll definitely have a few things to say about it.\nStory - 5/10\nArt - 8/10\nSound - 6/10\nCharacters - 6/10\nEnjoyment - 3/10\nOverall - 5/10\nFavorite character - Misato \nFavorite episode - 6\n        "},

Hell, I don't even know why I'm reviewing anything at all, it's 2am, Christmas Day. But NGE especially, as even from my limited knowledge of anime, it's probably the most divisive ever made. And to quote my previous sentence, \"my limited knowledge of anime\" makes this review even more fragile.\nNo matter what I put, there will obviously be people who disagree, and people who ignore this based on my inexperience. I'm going to try use this to my advantage; NGE is always one of the first animes mentioned in any newcomer thread\n          \n        I've seen, so I'll approach it like that: as a relative newcomer to the anime scene. So, without further ado:\nNeon Genesis Evangelion doesn't really explain much in the opening episode. About a year ago I watched the pilot, thought \"that's fairly cool\", and then dropped it, so if you want to get a proper sense of it, watch the first three consecutively. Not only does this give you a better handle on what the hell's going on, they also give a bit of a preview of what you're dealing with here. The fight in the third episode is rather dark for the first half of the series, but it is more indicative of the latter half.\nAnyways, the story is fairly simple, at least to begin with. A catastrophe known as Second Impact kills half the world's population, and 15 years later, giant monsters known as Angels attack Tokyo-3, the residence of our resident hero, Shinji Ikari. Shinji gets taken to his estranged father's workplace, is shown a giant robot and a barely living pilot of said giant robot, and is basically told to stop being such a whiny bitch and get in.\n\"Thus begins an epic tale, an almost Shakespearean bildungsroman, and a harrowing look into the deepest recesses of the mind...\"\nIn other words, that's when stuff starts going down.\nOne thing I'd like to clarify before I continue. Evangelion isn't completely bleak from start to finish, I'd argue that episodes 7 to 15 are actually fairly lightweight for the most part. That's not to knock it though, episode 9 is still one of my favourites, but it's the last minutes of episode 15 that really kick the show into gear, and THUS begins the NGE that everyone remembers. I remember checking the Wiki entry for the show when I was about 10 episodes in, and going \"Horror? Where's the horror?\" Trust me, there's horror enough in the later episodes. And if that isn't good enough for you, get EoE.\nThe once-simple story quickly gets too complicated to summarise without major spoilers, so I'll leave it to you, suffice to say it contains enough \"...the ****?\" moments for all the family.\nThe characters. Oh boy, the characters. Yeah, here's where most of the controversy over the show comes in. Shinji's defining characteristic by the end is his angst, Asuka's is being a massive bitch, and Rei's is the whole utterly lacking a personality thing. That said, I loved them. Yup, I could forgive them for their unlikable qualities, and genuinely root for and relate to them. Maybe not all the time, but they all have their reasons for turning out the way they do, and I think it's a fairly realistic depiction of how most of us would actually react, if we were in their positions.\nThe art work is great, if a tiny bit dated. It's only an issue if you watch Rebuild first though, and it's in no way a wreck. However, as I've said, I'm a newbie, so don't take my word for it. I don't really know enough here to comment so I won't. All I'll say is, for the sake of your own enjoyment, don't over-analyse the crossplosions.\nThe music, for the most part, is pretty good. The soundtrack is usually fairly standard, the opening theme is brilliant, and I love the covers of Fly Me To the Moon. Thing is, as TVTropes will tell you, NGE is very fond of what's called \"Soundtrack Dissonance\", where they play beautiful, soothing music over horrific moments. It's done very well indeed and is usually massively unsettling. There's one particular scene in the show when a major character gets their mind torn to shreds and their horrifying past laid bare to a rather jaunty rendition of the Hallelujah Chorus. It's a scene that, to paraphrase Yahtzee Croshaw \"Gripped me by the balls\", even while it got almost too depressing to watch.\nAll in all, Neon Genesis Evangelion got to me. I loved the characters, loved the story, and it really made me think, so I can't really give it anything less than a 9 (It's not perfect, so I can't quite give it a 10, but the issues are really too minor to mention and it's easily a 9.9). It's a must-watch, as far as this beginner's concerned, and I hope this wasn't too terrible of a review to do it justice!\n        "},
		{["score"]=2,  ["helpful"]=27,   ["text"]="                          \n    Ineptness and powerlessness: the anime.\nThat's all there is to Evangelion. It's a show about a teenage boy who has to become a mecha pilot. Only he's a nervous wreck with low self esteem, and he's bad at piloting.\nHe's also going through puberty, and is sexually frustrated (shown more overtly in End of Evengelion). He's interested in some girls, the horrible emasculating Asuka and zombie-like Rei. However, they are not interested in him. He fails to connect with them on an emotional level, and they didn't give him much to work with.\nIneptness is a a recurring theme here, Shinji doesn't handle action well in his mecha,\n          \n        and he can't handle talking to girls, or much of anything. And overall powerlessness. Not to say we can't relate to a flawed protagonist, but Shinji is tough to root for or connect with as a viewer.\nIn some ways this is an interesting choice, especially back in the 90s, because it was a deconstruction of anime. Take Gundam or Macross, remove the romance or heroic action, and you get this. Yes, that had potential to be something special. It's certainly memorable. But ultimately... not a good thing.\nHistory will show those older shows like Gundam, Macross, or even Mazinger Z are still more influential to the genre than Evangelion is. What more is there to say with a show about a kid who can't pilot or connect emotionally. Which doesn't go anywhere. They tried something different, I'll give them that, but for me it didn't add up to a satisfying character driven story, or meditation on the human condition.\n The show has good animation, music, voice acting, and is well directed in general. I love the theme song. Also, there is one really likable character, Misato. And Kaji's nice too. And I do like PenPen the penguin.\nPretty much, Evangelion is a unique show that starts out interesting, if only for how depressing and different it is. Unfortunately, there is no light at the end of the tunnel, and all we get is a big pile of unsatisfying powerlessness. I can enjoy a bleak or dark tale, but this particular one to me I just don't feel, since I don't think the characters give us much to work with. And the story other  than some intrigue to start with doesn't really go anywhere. Ultimately, I give them kudos for trying, but for me it's not a good series. And yes, it has one of the worst ending ever.\n I recommend watching the original Gundam movie trilogy or series, the Zeta Gundam series if you want bleak mecha done compellingly, and something like Macross for epic fun and romance with your mecha. And of course, Gunbuster. Also Arcadia of my Youth, classic movie with Space Pirate Captain Harlock. So much great sci-fi and mecha stuff out there.\n        "},

Conveniently the EVA's can use assault rifles and other armament that NERV can't simply make into mobile weapon units to maybe hurt the Angels with. The disconnect is when an EVA uses a projectile weapon it suddenly turns into a weapon that can negate the force fields of Angels and sometimes out right kill them.  This is unexplained and a very\n          \n        glaring plot-hole it self.  \nNow I can see how wasting ammo at the beginning can introduce the viewers to how powerful the Angels are, but repeatedly doing so is very dumb... \nThis same NERV , that is composed of elite military minds, decided that 14 years old kids will be the controllers and pilots of weapons of mass destruction or EVA's.  This plot seemed like the typical shounen plot-line, but its so far from it, very far. \nArt-\nWe have fluid motion and nice hand drawn frames. Everything looks and flows well while somewhat dated by today's standards, it is still very watchable. \nThere are some questionable biblical symbolism. I am not sure what they mean. They might be meaningless. \nSound-\nThe sound was very good for the most part. All the music seemed to fit to the situations and that is as much as I can say for that as I am not very big on music. \n\nCharacters -\nShinji. This guy alone corrupts the whole show. The other characters were all decently crafted, but they all were overshadowed by Shinji and placed to help prop up the loser that is Shinji. So I will focus on Shinji. \nSeriously. I do not understand how he can be so self loathing. I know people without arms, without legs, blinded, the deaf, the poor, the starved, and people have the gale to say \"Shinji is realistic\". In my eyes I can't even fathom such a wimpy person.  I understand people get depressed, and sometimes that mental illness can make you not care at all, but when the show is 99% self pity while nearly 99% of the world needs you to fight and you keep calling your self worthless. It becomes a chore to watch. Over and over again. It happens. The self loathing is so unnatural, even the most depressed person in the world when given the purpose of SAVING HUMANITY would at least love them self a little more. Give themselves more worth and at least try to do something with thier, in thier mind, \"worthless life\". When your life is worth almost all of humanity it should tend to be worth a lot more. The show hardly gives Shinji the development he deserved.  This is a black stain on Hideaki Anno career.\nEnjoyment-\nIt was a very hard watch. I wanted to complete the show before reviewing it or else I would have dropped it at around ep 4. \n\n\n"},

All of this he said so himself while laughing during a secret commentary track I downloaded. I'm assuming the devil possessed him during said\n          \n        commentary, and gave him the clarity to speak English so well... \nNow onto the review: Evangelion follows the story of a Father who is trying to cure his Son from an unknown debilitating disease which causes him to produce little to no testosterone and cry all day. It's a very gripping drama in that sense\nNot even being given a robot with which to save the world and his own harem of unstable women (let's be honest we all know women are always unstable, if they wanted stability, big paychecks, and the respect of this reviewer they would have been born men) who hand themselves over on a silver platter stop our diva of an mc from needing a new pack of tissues to weep into.\nIf you're a young man who is incapable of producing a single hair on his body and would rather cry all day when faced with responsibility then this is the show for you! Either that or you're a woman in disguise in which case you have way too much time on your hands, and shouldn't be watching anime to begin with...\nWhy aren't you in a relationship with me and sending me a friend request? Too busy promoting atheistic works like this, I suppose.\nI should also mention that at one point our feckless naked mole-rat of an mc (Shinji) develops feelings for a male alien\nthat's right a male alien\nI've had previous encounters with the dreaded Homosexual in such works as Durarara!!(http://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=214075 <-- review here) in which Homosexuals are lawless rogues who want nothing more than to run amok creating gangs and leaving untold property damage with their fruity shenanigans. Luckily, for the populace of EVA our young buck Shinji is too meek to follow in the footsteps of his criminal Homosexual contemporaries \nThe only positives I can give EVA is that it helped to strengthen my faith in our holy father despite blatant attempts to make me waver and denounce his name, and for that I am eternally grateful.\nOne can only assume that the suggestion to watch this was a cruel prank on the part of my betrothed, Amy. She must have wanted to test not only the fortitude of our relationship, but how quickly I would denounce such corrupt and sordid works as EVA. Not to worry babe since EVA just got baptized!"},

Seen as a 'must watch' for anime fans, NGE did not disappoint showing why the controversial and influential series that I've heard so much about.\nThe story at most times is enjoyable, the characters, while not the greatest cast I've seen, had some crazy developments. The action scenes were few for a mecha, but short and sweet, leaving more time for character interaction and development. \nThe shows ending (both the last 2 eps and EoE) are really what most people take about for NGE. How the series left\n          \n        us with virtually nothing but a consolidating clap, and EoE, while satisfying in some aspects left my mind in a sea of human orange juice. In doing so, I admire the boldness of the show and respect that it allows us to come up with our own interpretations that we can discuss with fellow fans and friends for years to come.\nI found Eva to be quite enjoyable, watching the characters develop relationships and fight angels in badass biomechs. This is up until about episode 20 anyway. The story then decides to get into the crux of things, escalating quickly and making it feel very rushed (perhaps due to lack of money) and it feels like your minds been tossed into a washing machine on an endless cycle.\nLooking at the last half dozen episodes and EoE, you are left with more questions then answers and one would think \"why bother? Is there any point in trying to interpretate this at all?\" However, to me, the fact that the first 20 episodes where so enjoyable makess all the deciphering and theorizing worthwhile. The show is enjoyable then rapes your mind and leaves you with an endless topic of discussion. \nSo bravo, instead of providing a satisfying and happy ending to an enjoyable series that would have been memorable, Anno creates a series that we not only look back on, but constantly theorize in an attempt to perhaps one day understand what NGE is all about (but we all know that's not going to happen)\n        "},

Yet most of the show had no music just dialogue. In the movie there were a handful ones but I can't remember them clearly.\nCharacters 9/10 \nIf I stopped at the first 13 episodes the characters side would have got a 6 or a 7 , the next 13 episodes showed that this was just the beginning and it got an 8 from my personal view and the movie makes it a 9 , because the characters are generic at first glance, because as I heard they created the generic term. Rei Ayanami's character has been copied so much to death that when I saw it at first glance I was bound to reject the character. and so is Shinji's character , but you do realise how genuine their character is unlike the shows that copied it. and the show is strong at character development, and it is the core in which how the show progresses within.\nEnjoyment 9/10\nI did enjoy the show at most times , its misses weren't that much , but it could have had a better start and more importantly if they used background music to all its defining moments the show could have been way better. With that said , The story and the characters are amazing and this definitely needs a remake with the same story in my opinion.\nOverall (9 + 7 + 7 + 9 + 9)/5 = 8.2\nCeiling 8.2 is 9\nso it is a 9/10 (Excellent)\nNote : This is by far the only mecha series that I have gotten along with and enjoyed everything including the mecha battles\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=25,   ["text"]="                          \n    As a pretty recent Anime fan, I felt it was necessary to check out all the series that many would consider Must See shows, and of course Evangelion is one of them. From what I have seen from others, the show seems very polarizing, some loving the show, some hating it. I seem to fall more toward the loving it, but the show is not without fault.\nStory\nThe story of Evangelion is what makes it stand out among other Mech anime, turning what could have been a generic, plain, monster of the week show into something different. I find the story of Evangelion to be very\n          \n        interesting, and is what kept me going through the show most of the time. It has many twists and turns, especially in the latter half and it does a good job of keeping you hooked in. That said, I personally found the story quite hard to follow in the latter half of the show and found it quite confusing. What hurts the story the most is ending. While I won't go into spoiler territory, it is incredibly unsatisfying and leaves the viewer with many unanswered questions about the ultimate fates of the characters, and I feel it seriously hurts the story. This problem was rectified by the movie End of Evangelion, which I feel gave good closure to the show, but this is a review of the show, not the film, so the score is based on only the show.\nCharacters\nAs well as the story being what hooks the viewer in, the small but varied cast of Characters are also very interesting. Each one is given a back story and is fleshed out and there is a lot of psychological evaluation of all the characters, giving people an insight into their minds. That being said, while the characters are well written and developed, most of the main cast is quite unlikable. Shinji is constantly whining, Asuka is always an annoying bitch, especially concerning Shinji and Rei is almost robotic. While there are good, in depth reasons for why each character acts the way they do, they still aren't very likable and it makes it harder to relate the the characters and care about them.\nOverall\nOverall, it's not hard to see why Neon Genesis Evangelion got so popular and why it is so polarizing, even almost 20 years after its début. The story and characters are very deep and complex, if not somewhat hard to follow, making it a very engrossing show to watch, even if it is let down by it's initial ending.\n        "},

Character design is great, as well as Mecha design (those fucking Eva are too cool, spectacular!). In general I never much to say about the graphics, it is not a matter of which I am very interested, but I must admit that in this anime was really impressed by the technical sector. The sound...wow! OST are perfect in every situation, and OP and ED are amazing.\nComment:\nThis is for sure my favourite anime of all time with \"Cowboy Bebop\". I've never seen an anime so deep and introspective. These themes very heavy and closely related to existentialism, I think that would dwarf even Martin Heidegger.

What is the big secret that Kaji knows, and why he is an spy (for who and for what?)?\nDoubts that I still having: Why Shinji is the easiest to pilot Eva's? Why Shinji's father is an asshole? Who are the angels? What is the reason for the accident of the two \"Shell\" were downed in the Earth? Why Ritsuko killed the another Rei's, and still out of it?\nOfc have another wrong at the plot or doubts, but these are the most important.\nThe anime forces you to create theories, and more doubts and discussion, doesn't turn him good, just exposes his fails who have in the anime, and because he's not concise\nArt - Dude, Ok, that anime was made 20 years ago, but couldn't be better? had very very repetitive scenes, really, or scenes who had staying ONE MINUTE JUST WITH THE SAME IMAGE (Elevator scene and a lot of hospital scenes), out that, the personages are good drawed, and the fight scenes are kinda good tho.\nSound - One of his strong points. What was that opening? of 26 episodes, at least 18 I did listened the whole opening, I very liked. And the fight scenes or thriller scenes, though very limited, They created a kind of tension and exciment in watch what happening, and that scene when started to play classic music? WHAT WERE THAT, Gave me a impression of something tragic was happening (what of course was), in other words (darling kiss me), combined as well with the scene.\nPersonages - This was the 2nd biggest strong point. All personages are relevant for the serie, and have a \"portion\" of blame in all facts who happened, the psychological treatment who each other have, and psychological horror inserted at them is just great.\nShinji - I'm definitely of \"against\", I guess. Because I really liked him, really, he's like Natsuki Subaru from Re:Zero, but without the determination of the same. Although he have fear, he always is in there, fighting, don't because he want to, but because he have to make it, because he tried to ran away twice times, but in the twice times, he perceives who anybody else could resolve the problems that the humanity battles. the psychological trauma that he have...it's simply magnific, the hate that he have of his father, it's quite understandable, since he was dropped of in the Childhood by the same.\nAsuka - PROBABLY, SHE'S THE BIGGEST ANNOYING CHARACTER THAT I'VE EVER MET, she's envious, always make troubles, discussion and conspiracy, is inane, always want to appears herself, maybe she has all of worst, there is a reason to she is like it? BELIEVE IN ME, DOESN'T HAVE! She suffered big traumas in childhood, but nothing justify why she's so arrogant and futile as she is.\nRei - I already said I love Kuudere characters? characters like her, are simply adorable, they doesn't feel fear, doesn't feel love, doesn't feel anything, and isolate themselves, and when isolating themselves, feel loneliness, and then create a psychological horror with themselves, this is just awesome!!! There is a reason to she is like a \"robot\", she's like this because she's like a Android, or any other name for a lab test, so, she can't feel something, after all, she was made with an objective already, and all we know that Humans seek their own objectives\nKatsuragi - Another character type that I love, she's like a \"big mother\", always willing to help, for some lack reasons maybe, or empty existential, but she always is in there to help, and support the Asuka & Shinji pain. She doesn't have objectives to be achieved (As all Evangelion characters, who addresses the theme of the meaning of life), she's just in there, doing what have to do, because hate the Angels.\nShinji's Father - THIS GUY IS AN ASSHOLE, really, he's despicable, disgusting, makes me feel desire to punch his face. Why he's the general? precisely for being like this, cold and calculist, who is willing to abandonate the own son or descard the chosen children to achieve to your goal. the his objectives are implicit, and maybe he is so desesperate to achieve your goal, That he will eventually fail.\nEnjoyment: DEFINITELY THE WORST THING. The anime have 26 episodes, but can have at least 15 episodes totally useless, how can a anime what just excites in the episode 15-17 be good? Idk\nThe anime have action scenes COMPLETELY cliche and obvious, that you already know what is gonna happen, sometimes for pure protagonism (Shinji entering in Berserk mode) or for pure Action Yield (Asuka x Angel in the lava).\nRepetitive scenes as the fight of 17 angels, really? couldn't decreases the quantity? or compress 2 fights in one episode or something, and just focus the other episode in the history, who didn't nothing developed?\nSome good thing to emphasize of his anime is the tension created in each episode, And that holds you till the end of the same, when they shows a doubt in the beginning of the episode, and just does answer in the final.\nThe 1-15 episodes gonna make you say \"Why that anime is so overrated?\",  the 21-24 episodes gonna make you say \"WHAT A GENIAL ANIME\", and the 25-26 episodes gonna make you say \"Ok, but what happened?\", that psychological attack making he accept herself, for in the final he receives a lot of congratulations, was completely despicable and laughable.\nConclusion: I still without understand why this anime is a reference in script and plot, when they does precisely the opposite of how to make a good work. A anime who needs of a movie and theories for affirm the things, can't called as something good, this is my opinion. But watch it, for shows to the others how much this anime is terrible ;)\n        "},

		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="                          \n    This review only applies for the first 6 episodes of the series, it does not constitute for the overall experience of the anime itself and it will be comprised of what I liked/disliked about the anime and the reason I have had dropped it for.\nSo I can summarize the entire story in a non-spoilery way while giving the total relevance of everything that's been happening in the story in only three words: Shinji is depressed. Basically none of the events of the story shine more than the main character's depressive demeanor. The show is portrayed with a melancholic atmosphere which didn't clique with me because\n          \n        the only elements it's comprised is the scenery being formed mostly of cold and dark colors & the lack of personality traits everyone else has. The series focuses on how Shinji is forced to pilot a mecha and how he just goes along with it because fuck it. Especially while he seems to hate it a lot and he keeps being like \"I should quit. Actually I shouldn't. I should quit. Actually I shouldn't\"\nThere are some other characters but none of them seem particularly interesting. I mean pick a trope, tone it down by like 10 times the way it's executed in general, and that's your cast of characters. They basically feel like cannon fodder. There's one character, a girl, that there is some focus put on outside of Shinji, but imagine this, you already have a depressive teenager as the main character. What's your other character you start putting some focus on. A character that seems to lack any emotions. If anything she's there just to interact with Shinji, but all other characters are lke that already. Ikari Shinji is pretty much the only character that shines through with his one character trait which is depression. Which I can't say it's done badly, as a matter of fact, his depression comes across in a pretty realistic way, I mean you can characterize depression to basically being unable to focus on anything positive and Shinji is portrayed exactly like that. He doesn't care much for anything and pretty much spends his time doing what he's told to do or being brooding. But my problem is, lets say the story goes on the route of him getting over his depression and he's finally happy or something like that. But he has no other personality trait or element to which you can relate to. Because while his depression was thrown aside and wasn't the focus, Shinji brought nothing to the table and is used as a mean to move focus away from him. Lets say he stays depressed through the whole series and things get worse for him. I wouldn't care because the only thing that defines him is again, depression, so what happens to him wouldn't matter much to me. If the character was fleshed out in some way, any way that would differentiate he himself as an individual, so I would be able to care , could've kept me interested. \nOh and you might also find some interest on how the series tried to be futuristic and how hard they got it wrong. Since it's set in 2015 and all and they were aiming for a futuristic world and you might enjoy seeing how many things they got wrong. Considering the animation and sound is also very generic, at the very least it feels and looks very 90's, you might get a kick out of this.\nBut what I'm trying to say is that the series mostly banks on having a melancholic tone. Which I find hard to follow up with. There is basically nothing else in the series I can even find people being able to relate to or find entertaining. The mecha fights aren't particularly interesting, I mean, they are not bad, but like, they felt pretty average in term of overall action and with the dated animation which doesn't look bad, mind you, but it doesn't exactly look that entertaining either. I mean, the series was animated 20 years ago, so you can expect the fights to hold up only as much after all. \nSo basically I'd suggest this anime to you if you can relate to depression or anything similar to it. If you can, you might enjoy this since that's pretty much the only thing that cliques in it. That's the only thing about this series that has any sort of outline. Everything else, was, pretty much just bleak and with no relevance. Which gives the melancholic atmosphere even more power, which, is the one thing that shines through the 6 episodes I've seen.  If you expect anything different than a depressing tone, you probably won't enjoy this, since this is pretty much the one thing that really shines in the series. I can't say I see things changing in further episodes so I can't say you could expect anything more. Anyway if you would enjoy something about depression, then this is right up your alley. Just note that this is very pure. And for anyone that can't relate to it, it's probably gonna be a bad experience.\n        "},

It was strange because it oddly seemed to \"follow\" me everywhere, as I would see it come up in places. Off and on it did that for the longest time and it was from last year to recently that I started to see it more than usual. It came to a head when my boyfriend said he had seen it and strongly recommended it to me, telling me it was a\n          \n        lot deeper than it seemed. Finally, about a month ago, I conceded and sat down to watch it.\nSteadily, I became familiar with the characters and their story, their Evas and the psychological issues they were plagued with, their pain and suffering, their views and fears... primarily, Shinji Ikari and his Eva, Unit-01. As I watched this series, I slowly became emotionally drawn in, as if walking down a road that slowly became more jagged and twisted, further into the minds of the characters and the deep secret behind their Eva Units as well as other NERV members, particularly Misato and Gendo.\nI was so engrossed in it, I found myself reacting with angry and fearful emotion for some of the situations presented, a few in particular. I had watched anime for a long time now, but very few anime have ever impacted me in this way nor did most never make me feel almost emotionally drained at several points. When I came to the conclusion of this anime, I was riddled with many questions, and yet strangely, at the same time, some answers. I proceeded further to watch End of Evangelion, which brought even more questions, but moreso answers. I came to realize, this anime raises a lot of questions because it is difficult to understand, but simple, once you do.\nI thank my boyfriend for finally getting me to watch this anime, because it teaches many things: despair and hope, death and rebirth, failure and succession. Finally having watched this intricate and complex show, it has now become, arguably, my most favorite anime to date and will likely stay that way for a long time to come. :)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=24,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Three letters: EVA.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is, without a doubt, one of the biggest and most popular and influential anime programs in history. And it's for good reason - it dared to do what other shows in the mid-90s didn't. It pushed a lot of boundaries and it dared to explore new grounds. And it also didn't hurt that it was due to the show's director and writer, Hideaki Anno, being greatly depressed.\nWell... it kinda did, actually. But I'll get to that later.\nThe series, set in a post-apocalyptic Japan, circa 2015 A.D., is the story of 14-year-old Shinji Ikari, a boy who is brought to an\n          \n        underground organization called NERV by his estranged father and NERV commander, Gendo Ikari, to pilot a giant mecha called an Evangelion, his being labeled the EVA-01 (Unit 1), all to fight and fend off beings called Angels, who are hell-bent on destroying what's left of the world, after the Second Impact, in the year 2000, nearly killed off all of mankind.\nAs the story progresses, NERV brings in two more pilots, both female and 14 years of age: Rei Ayanami (EVA-00) and Asuka Langley Soryu (EVA-02), and as the story unfolds, more and more secrets are revealed that bring into question the integrity of NERV, and brings into question the true existance of the Evangelions.\nHalfway through the show, though, the series becomes less and less about the mecha action, but more about deconstructing the mecha genre itself, and focusing more on psychoanalysis of the main characters, and to a very dark and disturbing level. As mentioned earlier, the show's creator, Hideaki Anno, was very depressed throughout the series' run in Japan (1995-1996), which was a major factor of the show's swift 180-degree shift, halfway through, and especially with the last two episodes.\nReally, this is a show that, for over 15 years, has been riddled in controversy. Not just for its... shall we say, interesting use of religious iconography, or for its dark take on adolescent psychoanalysis, but for the sheer fact that a lot of people love it, and a lot of people hate it. A lot may not get the show, a lot may think too much about it, but it's definitely a show that will get talked about by everyone.\nIts three main protagonists deserve praise and/or criticizing, as well – for my review, I'll stick with praise. Watching through this series, I actually had no idea how relatable a character Shinji was, to me. In middle school and high school, I was just like Shinji – isolated, depressed, not wanting to interact with people, longing for acceptance. It's almost eerie, how close it gets. (Then there's his father, Gendo. Well, from someone who witnessed his own father get sent to jail in 2002, and has not seen him since (and never plans to, ever), I have no comment.)\nAsuka... oh, boy, Asuka. The bench mark of b*tchiness in anime. As much as I hate her attitude, I do find her to be a very deep and interesting character, always putting up a sheild to mask her true emotions. As for Rei, I find her to be another interesting character, but what really disturbs me about her, is that she's aware that NERV finds her to be expendible, and that she'd be willing to end her life, if NERV asked her to.\nAs I mentioned earlier, about its halfway-shift, many can immediately view this series in two identifiable halves: the first, being action-packed and adventurous, and the second, being dark and emotional, a shining example of the “It Got Worse” trope. (TVTropes, look it up) \nWith that said, though, this show isn't really about giant mecha action, but instead, it's about witnessing the downfall of these emotionally-insane characters. Much like the stage productions of ancient Greece, Evangelion is a tragedy. The characters all have fatal flaws, which lead to their eventual demise and breakdown.\nThree main episodes that definitely stand out in the series, at least to me, are the last 3 episodes of the series. \n(I'll keep it as spoiler-free as possible)\nEpisode 24 introduces a character named Kaworu, who immediately takes a liking to Shinji, offering him a much-needed friendship. That being said, that's all I can say without revealing spoilers, but I will say... it got worse. WAY worse.\nEpisodes 25 and 26 introduces the Human Instrumentality Project, and that's all I can say about it without revealing a MAJOR spoiler. What i can reveal, though, is that these episodes, at least to me, are the shining examples of this show's psychoanalysis theme. And the ending... again, spoilers, but you'll either hate it or you'll be like me and like it.\nYes, I actually did like the ending of the series, for one reason: I understood the intent of the last episode. Its intent being that life is all about perception, it's all about what you do and how you go about in life that makes you who you are, and you can make it to be whatever you want it to be. One little thing can change your whole life, and the best thing to do is to take it in stride and make the best situation possible out of it.\nBut with that being said... part of me feels dissatisfied with the closing scenes of the series. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, but there could've been... more, you know?\nThen I watched The End Of Evangelion. That, alone, requires a separate review.\nAnyway, before I start another tangent, let me get back on track.\nHow would I rank this series, as a whole? Well, I will say that it is amazingly good – great, even – but can I consider it a favorite of mine, like shows such as Inuyasha, Eureka 7, and Cowboy Bebop?\n...I can't. At least, not yet.\nI do give it a solid 9 out of 10, though, but from analyzing just how dark this story really is, I can't rank it to be a favorite of mine. At least, not a general favorite of mine.\nThat being said, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a very important staple in anime history, and a very influential series, as well, albeit a controversial one. It started a franchise, after all, that continues to this day, with the Rebuild of EVA movie series, and even the manga series, and manga spinoffs, and so on.\nIt may not be a perfect series, but it's a required viewing for any and all anime fans out there. If you want to know just what anime is capable of, watch this series.\n        "},

This same lack of money leads to a lot of watsed time throughout the series\nEven if one\n          \n        claims that the point of the series is not about science fiction but about psychology and philosophy, then it's arguably even worse. It makes almost no coherent points in that respect and those that it does are extremely trivial\nArt - 7/10\n=======\nThe art is pretty good for the time. The landscapes are very good, and the settings seem very real, not too futuristic or too grimdark\nSound - 7/10\n==========\nNot much to say here other than \"it's not bad\". There's nothing that stands out, but the music is pretty appropriate, even if simplistic, such as the drumming theme used in shots of NERV HQ. There is also some nice use of classical music. The opening \"A Cruel Angel's Thesis\" is very catchy, though I personally didn't like the ED\nCharacters - 5/10\n==============\nMany of the characters are very one dimensional. I am not calling the characters bad because I disliked them (I found Shinji to be much more relatable than an over 9000 shounen MC humanoid gun turret), but because they mostly seem to lack depth. Half of the characters can be summed up as \"S/he has Daddy issues\", and that's only explored insofar as to say \"parental neglect can cause confidence issues\", which isn't particularly insightful\nSome of the adult characters are more interesting, such as Kaji and Misato, who are employed by NERV for the role of being Best Guy and Best Girl, respectively, and the episode exploring the history of some of the major NERV players is interesting, but it's a shame we only got 1 episode of that\nRei is about the only properly original character IMO. Apparently she was written to show how creepy \"you're waifu\" would be if she really were as submissive as otaku's wanted them to be, and in my opinion it works well. I was expecting to find the shy, emotionless girl cute, but I really did just find her creepy, which means the author succeeded\nStory - 2/10\n==========\nThe story is mostly incoherent, but occasionally has some interesting parts, which it then proceeds to abandon. The first half of the show is mostly pretty boring action and episodic plots, there is a lot of filler. The second half becomes a bit more interesting\nIf you condense down all of the scenes about the conspiracy of NERV etc., it would make a mildly interesting 60 minutes, however, there is a critical lack of exposition, so many events just are never explained, and any attempt to actually look further into these arcs is prompty interrupted by vapid pseudo-philosophical monologue about souls and men being from mars and women from venus or something\nThis comes to its conclusion with a lack of conclusion. Just as the show is finally starting to get interesting, we then suddenly have a new character appear for a single episode, who the audience is supposed to relate to after only 15 minutes of screen time, then in the next episode the plot comes to a complete halt and we are treated to 40 minutes of incoherent rambling that is claimed to be some sort of shallow psychoanalysis of the one dimensional characters. It's not really possible to answer \"Was Evangelion's ending good or bad?\" because it does not have an ending (at least, not in the original series)\nEnjoyment and Overall - 2/10\n=======================\nAnother thing to mention before the conclusion is the stretching of scenes due to a thin budget. Many episodes re use clips to save money animating new ones, which rarely add anything but just waste the audience's time. This culminates in the 3rd to last episode which uses a single frame for about 2 minutes\nOverall, I really cannot call this anime anything other than dreadful. This is not a backlash against its popularity or what I perceive as pseudo-intellectualism or anything like that, though that did get annoying at times, but at the fact that the plot just barely exists. There is little enjoyment in watching about 8 hours of a show to get 60 minutes of a proto plot that is never completed, and this show brings very little else of value to the table\nAs a psychological/philosophical exploration, it says nothing more interesting than the first 3 pages of any textbook on either subject, or even just a conversation with your mates over beers.  This also raises the question of why even bother with the plot if there was never any point to it. If you are looking for the sort of themes that this show is said to explore, it's a better usage of your time to just browse Wikipedia or Youtube for them\nEdit: Increased rating of characters, because they're actually not as bad as I said\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=15,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion (NGE) dives into a dystopian universe that starts with a typical premise but quickly takes a bizarre turn. This review is spoiler free, and I am happy to answer questions! \nScroll down to see my recommended watching order. \nCharacters: 9/10\nWhile some people dislike the protagonist, Shinji Ikari, I consider him one of anime’s most unique and complex characters. He whines a lot, true, but he offers a more realistic perspective of how a child might react to being told he (or she) must save the world. Unlike the popular Ichigo Kurosaki style of kicking ass while facing impossible odds with only brief\n          \n        flashes of doubt and long bouts of training (which I also enjoy), this shounen gives us a reluctant protagonist who fights out of fear of being unwanted, along with other societal pressures. This creates a very human and realistic character I appreciate and love. \nUnfortunately, Shinji barely changes throughout the story, ping-ponging his choices and desires instead of making choices and moving forward (or backward). Real people tend to act more like this, but audiences tend to expect more from characters. I think this causes a lot of frustration in many viewers who consider Shinji a weak, boring, and inactive protagonist. I, personally, disagree. Shinji is clinically depressed, a character handicap most mecha or battle shounen ignore. His depression affects most of his actions and is an interesting, if disheartening, battle to watch. So, if you’re interested in realism, you might find Shinji interesting. If you want an action-heavy hero, you’ll probably roll your eyes at him. \nFor those who don’t know, NGE’s creator battled depression while writing this story, which is how the anime slips from a shounen into an exploration in psychology.\nShinji aside, the entire cast is solid and well developed. From protagonists to antagonist (and those who ride the rail between the two), character motivation is well explained and developed. Steeped in psychology, NGE takes more time to show you why characters behave as they do, exposing an underlying cause for behavioral issues, insecurities, and motivations.\nAnother plus: the cast offers a wide variety of characters, several of which have become iconic in the anime world, including Rei, Asuka, and Misato. However, these personalities tend to be extremely strong and vibrant, which may seem abrasive to some viewers. I, however, found both Asuka and Misato amazing and loved their sheer amount of sass and competence.\nMost of the characters also share significant relationships with other characters. They don’t just float but seem to exist outside of the plot. It feels as if we know what the character would be doing if they didn’t have to save the world. Thankfully, they didn’t drop from the sky and into the story.\nIn truth, the characters are one of the most compelling aspects of NGE.\nPlot: 7/10\nLet’s face it: NGE is confusing. You will probably understand the gist of it, but don’t feel bad if NERV, Angels, Evas, Adam, Human Instrumentality Project, AT Fields, Terminal Dogma, SEELE, Second and Third Impact, GEHIRN, Dead Sea Scrolls, and all the names and mecha terminology to boot--not to mention the alternate universe theories and references to Kalabalah, Christianity, Judaism Buddhism, Shintoism, and Gnosticism all told through a surreal, Freudian perspective--gets you a little lost.\nAside from the fact it is difficult to follow at times and the feeling you’re missing very subtle and not so subtle hints, it is a solid plot that moves at quick pace and will take many unexpected turns. It does have a slow start, but those first episodes are by no means bad, just a little more typical. \nNGE is an exploration in depression told through a Freudian lens, and the plot reflects this. Situations are often hopeless and, despite the success of some plans, the characters stumble away bruised, battered, and more upset than before. On the other hand, the plot is difficult to predict yet doesn’t seem random, offering logical solutions to complex problems.\nBrutal yet surreal, the plot kept me sitting at the edge of my seat—until the last two episodes. Oh yes, these infamous episodes lived up to their reputations as an absolute breakdown of narrative story telling. If you love psychology, these episodes will seem like a dream. I don’t want to describe them too much and spoil the unique experience, but I’ll also recommend you pass on watching these if you’re not interested in 40+ minutes of characters asking cryptic, large-scale, existential questions. Personally, I feel as if these episodes do have a lot to say, but I’ve never bothered to figure out what that message is. They are a disappointing end to a great show (so much so the franchise got two movie series!).\nThat being said, too many people try to discover the meaning behind NGE. Sometimes there are no right answers, and NGE is a show where everyone needs to find how the show spoke to them at a personal level. It will speak to everyone in different ways as it covers problems many of us face: social pressure, the desire to belong, loneliness, helplessness, depression, and love (of all kinds).\nNGE is heavily influenced by Freudian psychology as well, which means the desire to return to innocence and parental issues are prominent in the show.\nArt: 10/10\nA stunning work of animation, I have rarely seen a show that uses sound and angles as effectively as NGE. The art style itself is older, as is the show, but it actually benefits the tone. NGE’s off-colored atmosphere adds to the dystopian feel. The fight scenes are brutal and well-done, if a tad disturbing at times. In fact, I’ve heard (but never confirmed) some imagery was considered so disturbing the show was almost terminated but received a budget cut instead.  \n(angles)\nThe show uses angles and quick screens to create tension. It also uses the scene’s layout and angles to create feelings of sadness or aloneness. The show clearly focused on colors, sounds, and angles and considered how they could help tell the story.\n(intro and outro)\nThe intro is famous for being amazing, so I won’t add much here. Yes, the intro is fantastic, especially if you’ve already seen the show. The song –Cruel Angel Thesis—is one of the best. The outro song keeps changing as well, which I’m sure has some sort of meaning I missed.\n(OST)\nAgain: fantastic. This show does not ignore a single aspect of TV and carefully considers not just characters and plot but presentation as well. The music adds to the show and helps create emotions and tension throughout the story, as do the sound effects.\nFemale Representation: 10/10\nThere are a handful of naked people and fan service shots in NGE. These shots often sexualize a character, as so do their outfits. But this show includes a lot of Freudian psychology, and anyone who has studied Sigmund Freud knows he was a very sexually disturbed individual. While the fandom sexualizes of some characters to a level I find disgusting, the show does a little of this on its own. But it’s not just the kids and it’s not just the young girls: NGE sexualizes everyone. So this isn’t so much of a “female” thing as it is a warning to anyone who shies away from naked people. \nRegardless, this show has amazing female representation. Females populate the world as much as males, meaning not all of the background workers are male. In fact some of the most capable characters are female. We see females and males in positions of power and both sexes are allowed to be powerful.\nThe girls and boys receive equal development and share in having sad pasts and lots of issues. The females exist as characters, not plot devices, and they have a wide range of personalities. Both sexes are allowed to be strong but flawed. Males and females are treated equally as characters and by characters in the show. That, in truth, is all I ever really want. \nSub or Dub:\nI watched the first episode in dub and hated it. I thought it was awful, especially Shinji. The sub, on the other hand, gripped me tight and didn’t let go. I feel the Japanese VAs did a wonderful job displaying the varying emotions of the cast.\nWarnings:\nThis show is violent and disturbing, covering difficult topics that may make some squeamish. It is not for the faint of heart or those adverse to lots of blood, naked people, or daddy issues.\nWatching order explained:\nBasically there is a manga series, an anime (which came before the manga), and five movies (which came after those last two episodes managed to piss off an entire nation). \nThe manga and the Rebuild of Evangelion movies follow the anime’s story premise. They have the same characters, adversaries, and problems in general. However, both the manga and the Rebuild of Evangelion series offer separate, alternative versions of the NGE anime, from which many theories have sprung.\nMovies in relation to NGE canon:\nNeon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth – a clip show consisting of material from the anime and The End of Evangelion\nThe End of Evangelion –an alternate conclusion to the anime’s ending (mainly a reaction to those last two episodes)\nRebuild of Evangelion- a series of four movies (only three are out)\nEvangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone – first movie in the rebuild series  \nEvangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance ¬– the second movie in the rebuild series\nEvangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo – the third movie in the rebuild series\nEvangelion: 3.0+1.0 – the fourth and final movie in the rebuild series, which has not been released yet but is rumored (not confirmed) to be out sometime at the end of 2015 or start of 2016.\nMy recommended to watch order is:\nAnime\n(read the) Manga\n(skip Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth)\nThe End of Evangelion\nRebuild of Evangelion movies (in order)\nRewatch anime\nOverall: 8.5/10\nI plan to re-watch the show in the hopes I understand some of things I missed the first time, which gives this anime a high re-watch quality. Again, let me know if you have any questions! "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion. These three words, this one title, and the millions of people who talk about it.... what do they all have in common? They exist. But, you know what doesn't exist? Characters in the show that aren't mentally broken in some way.乁( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ㄏ\nPossibly the most controversial anime of all time, this is an anime that I would say you need to watch, no matter how much you don't want to, just for the experience.\nOk. Here we go. Time to start the review. Holy crap, the pressure. \n__________________________________________________________________________\nSTORY: 6/10\nPerhaps the most enticing thing about Evangelion is that it is a story of\n          \n        the future. Though, this trope has become decently overused, it's still an interesting premise and is sure to get the watcher hooked immediately. But does it live up? Oh, yeah it does! The battles with angels keep becoming more and more traumatizing, and the show is just plain EPIC. So what does it all lead up to, you ask? Well.... I don't know, either. The last couple episodes of Evangelion are extremely confusing, and what do they lead up to? Nothing. Really, almost nothing. The ending is satisfying, yet, so, so irritating at the same time. It's the kind of thing that makes you go \"REALLY?! THAT'S IT?! THEY EXPLAINED NOTHING, AND JUST OUT OF THE BLUE, THE END?!\" Well, luckily for us, the creators weren't satisfied with the ending either, which is why they tried to remake it... twice. But that's for another review.\n__________________________________________________________________________\nART: 8/10\nThe art style in Evangelion us average. Nothing, and I mean nothing about it would stand out and tell you 'THIS IS A SCENE FROM EVANGELION'. The animation? TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY. Gainax is known for it's amazing fight scenes, and Evangelion is no excuse! They did such a good job, that... well, they ran out of cash. Yep. You heard me. Gainax had a small budget for the last couple episodes, and because of that, it became... THAT. Dementia. Mind games. Nobody understands the heck is going on. But.. but... BUT. Ponder this. What if.. they ran out of budget... on purpose? In my opinion, they did. It was all part of their game. Gainax did it on purpose, they made Evangelion this way knowing what it would cause - and it worked perfectly.\n__________________________________________________________________________\nSOUND: 6/10\nThe sound of Evangelion is again, average. Sound effects, voice acting, and soundtrack are all fine, but not exceptional, and is unrecognizable apart from one or two battle themes. The endings are very bland, and are completely skippable. So what could possibly give it enough merit to be at a 6? Well your answer, my friend, is an opening theme that in my opinion, is possibly have been the best song to ever been recorded before the 21st century. It's addicting, it's epic, it's energetic, and most of all, it fits Evangelion PERFECTLY.\n__________________________________________________________________________\nCHARACTER: 9/10\nPerhaps even more controversial then the show itself is the main protagonist. They call Shinji a wimp, a loser, and just an annoying character. I can agree with that. But does that make him a bad character? No, no it really doesn't. Why? Because he's REALISTIC. Most of the characters in Evangelion, I guarantee you, would be exactly like someone in YOUR life, had they been thrown and mentally broken in this apocalyptic world. And the characters like Rei and Asuka, the ones you think 'oh they can't possibly be realistic', well, you're right about them too. It's their purpose to be badass, and unique. And you know something? The people loved it. So much, in fact, that they spawned the tropes of tsundere and kuudere. Put THAT into proportion. The supporting characters are also well done, but most of them aren't mind blowingly amazing like the main ones.\n__________________________________________________________________________\nOVERALL: 7/10\nEvangelion is... well, it's amazing. If I had to describe it, I would call it a masterpiece that wasn't a masterpiece. I dunno, that probably sounds weird as heck LOL. But it truly is a massive dot on the anime timeline, and deserves to be watched by all.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion is Hideaki Anno’s most renowned work, and is often hailed as a masterfully executed deconstruction of the mecha genre. By common definition a deconstruction aims to take apart a genre and it’s common tropes by portraying them in the most realistic way possible; seeing how they would work, and how they would fail. These works should build on the foundation of inherent flaws they uncover, and in this case, create something brilliantly subversive and unique. With the creation of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Anno took the Mech genre’s cliched idea of ‘teenagers who pilot giant robots being mankind’s last hope’ and subverted everyone’s\n          \n        expectations with a realistic approach focused on building psychological tension through the exploration of its characters.\nShinji ikari, is about as far away from charismatic as a character can be. As Shinji is first introduced, every definable aspect of his personality is punctuated by the abandonment of his father at a young age. Shinji needs to be useful to the people around him; but a fear of upsetting anyone he gets close to, as well as a complete lack of social skills cause him to isolate himself away from others. Shinji progresses and regresses frequently, it’s never a straight development. There are a series of highs and lows as stable influences enter and leave his life, pushing and pulling his self confidence in either direction. What’s remarkable about Shinji as a character is how perfectly he encapsulates a realistic portrayal of depression. Throughout the mid nineties Japan had been in a tough spot; the country was on the cusp of economic collapse, the population was rife with depression, and recent terror attacks had eviscerated the country’s moral, but because of a character like Shinji Ikari who resonated with such a wide demographic of people; Evangelion was propelled into the mainstream spotlight, and Shinji was serving as the audience surrogate for an entire country. Usually when a character is relatable to a large viewership they become a vehicle for wish fulfillment; it’s hard to deny that escapism sells well in this medium, but that’s the opposite of what Evangelion wants to achieve. While Shinji is constantly looking for ways to avoid his unpleasant reality, and outright runs away multiple times; eventually he has no alternative left other than to deal with his problems. The final episodes of the series actually take place inside of Shinji’s head, serving to exposit ideas as Shinji works through his conflicting thoughts. This part of the narrative is shown through the film ‘End of Evangelion’ which runs concurrently to the final arc of the main series.\nRei Ayanami is portrayed to be an emotionless doll. She has been backed into a corner of social isolation, and while this is only alluded to early on, she feels disconnected from her role as a pilot. Unlike Rei, everyone else in Evangelion has a justifiable reason to protect others; be it for family, friends, or the furthering of an ulterior motive. By comparison Rei is empty, until Shinji’s father puts himself in harm’s way for her sake; this is a prospect completely foreign to someone like her, who has seemingly never experienced compassion before. The first instance where her development becomes visible is literally shown through subverting a common trope in the medium; Shinji unintentionally falls on top of Rei with his hand on her breast, but instead of the usual comedic slap in the face, Rei say’s nothing about it. The slap comes later when she hears Shinji speak negatively towards his father.\nAsuka Langley Souryu is introduced eight episodes into Evangelion, these first episodes until now have all felt dour and depressing overall, but Asuka’s arrival alone is enough to completely shift the tone of the series in every aspect. her personality is comparable to a fireball; she is temperamental and vibrant. The fights which had been psychologically scarring from Shinji’s perspective earlier into the series, have now become flooded with energy, for Asuka they are a way to steal the spotlight and show off. This tone shift is not poorly executed though. Despite how frightened Shinji had been initially, recently he has gotten comfortable in his new life; he has a stable parental figure for the first time since early childhood, he has genuine friendships at his school, and he hardly even protests piloting the Evangelion anymore. By taking us to an unfamiliar environment and introducing a character who is so far removed from everything we’ve known about this world till now that she may as well be an alien here, Anno has taken us, and Shinji, far out of our comfort zone. Asuka is Shinji’s complete foil; where Shinji wants to please the people around him, Asuka wants their full admiration. She has placed herself on a pedestal high above everyone else, this is apparent in how she talks to her fellow pilots. Shinji is willing to be ordered around by the people above him, even if it takes some coercion, but with a bossy character like Asuka around who is the same age Shinji finally has an outlet to speak for himself. Asuka should be considered Shinji’s equal, yet she blatantly regards Shinji as her inferior, much to his annoyance. When the two of them are forced to share a living space together we finally see Shinji start to speak out defiantly towards someone else for the first time, and the dialogue between them results in the most fun character dynamic in the series. Even though Asuka’s characterization so far has been kinetic and vibrant, this is only her at a surface level. Asuka’s character is deeply layered, and while unbeknownst initially, she’s just as broken as Shinji. The person she shows others is a mask of superiority and confidence substantiated by her own burning insecurities.\nIt’s impossible to compress every idea Evangelion presents into a solitary central theme, but with the characters being such an important focus in the series, most ideas relate to the notion that characters are constantly changed by the influence of each other as well as their surrounding. Shinji is always changing because of how other characters interact with him. Misato and Shinji initially struggle to empathize with each other, describing their relationship through a metaphor of human intimacy, “The Hedgehog’s Dilemma”. They each want to develop a bond, but the closer they get the more they hurt each other in the process. Misato is Shinji’s direct superior, it’s her job to force Shinji into these situations of conflict, and he suffers for it. She wants to be a stable figure in his life, being in an almost maternal position, but her work is in direct conflict with her emotions. From Shinji’s perspective he is completely alone, surrounded by people causing him pain, but before running away he realizes that he isn’t the only one hurting. This is how many of Evangelions character dynamics are handled, with an equal mix of positive and negative influence, creating the closest thing to a character study in all of anime. There are also themes of self betterment, backed by continuous commentary against escapism. As a side note; while evangelion is rife with visual motifs and symbolism, none of the Christian elements are symbolic of anything. Despite the frequent appearance of things that reference Christianity none of them hold any symbolic meaning, Hideaki Anno maintains that it’s just an aesthetic detail.\nSpeaking of aesthetic details; perhaps the most important element of animation as an art form is the creative freedom it provides creators, this is true in the stylistic sense of art and design, but also in directing. Hideaki Anno is a director that knows how to lead the viewer’s eyes through a scene. When the focus is trained on a static character occupying a set portion of the frame, changing to a shot from a new perspective can be jarring if done poorly, but for slow scenes Anno maintains a visual cohesion throughout the each shot by having that characters remain in the same position of the screen. If he wants to snap your attention to where the action will occur in the following shot Anno will sometimes create a quick movement in that area of the frame, this is usually through an object in the background such as a closing door. Rather than the standard Shot/Reverse Shot between multiple characters during scenes of dialogue, Anno likes having both characters in the frame at the same time whenever possible, this can result in some unique perspective shots. Aside from camera work, with so many socially inept characters there are a lot of things that need to be conveyed through character acting; there is a high attention to detail put towards creating character nuance through subtle glances, movements, positioning, and even posture.\nEvangelion’s stylistically design work is in a tier of its own. Compared to the cubic and bulky designs common of the time, Eva’s mechs are all vibrantly colored, sleekly designed, and uniquely detailed from each other. The same can be said of the character designs, they have become iconic in the anime medium, Rei Ayanami especially; it’s to the extent that it feels like every other character aimed at being doll-like and mysterious is a dead ringer for Rei. Even Nobuhiro Watsuki has said he feels like his design for Tomoe, a character in his classic work Rurouni Kenshin, ended up as an Ayanami lookalike. The animation itself is an interesting subject, there are points of key animation throughout Evangelion, notably in the nineteenth episode, that are tour de force in quality, but a large portion of the production’s budget was cut because of a recent terrorist bombing. The last six episodes were completed with bare minimum funding, but because of the brilliantly creative staff working on the project they still managed to make it work. Some of the techniques the animators had to employ could be considered impressive works of art in their own right, Yoh Yoshinari’s hand drawn animation is a perfect example.\nThe lineup of talent working in Studio Gainax through this time period is arguably the strongest group that the industry has ever had working under one roof, and while working under Hideaki Anno this team had created one of the most natural and emotional works to ever come out of the field of animation.\nOriginal post on my blog! link on my profile.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    For years, I've been told that Neon Genesis Evangelion was one of the greatest anime ever made and that anyone who is into anime should watch it. I heard that it wasn't just some dumb anime that was all about action. In fact, I read tons of reviews saying that the series was full of philosophical themes and ideas. Despite hearing great things about the series, I knew it had mechs, and I can't stand mechs. I find mechs absolutely annoying. I don't just mean annoying in anime, but in any art form. I can't quite explain why, yet, that's just how I feel. I'm\n          \n        not a fan. So I avoided Neon Genesis Evangelion for awhile. But finally, starting a few days ago, I decided to take the plunge and watch the entire series.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion came out in the 90's, so I don't want to be too harsh when it comes to the animation or art. There are times when the show looks absolutely beautiful, particularly whenever Tokyo 3 is shown covered by the reddish-orange sky in the background. Those scenes are quite beautiful and give the show a feel that reminded me of Blade Runner. Other times, it looks pretty generic. \nWhen it comes to the soundtrack, Neon Genesis Evangelion has a few hits, but also a ton of misses. Apparently, I saw a poll a few days ago that showed the most popular anime karaoke song was \"A Cruel Angel's Thesis\", which is the OP for Neon Genesis Evangelion. I am rather shocked by this. The song sounds like something you would hear in a really awful b-movie. Not only does it sound like a generic pop song, but it doesn't even seem to fit with the show. ED isn't memorable at all. There are some really great tracks used for certain episodes. In the first few, a slow track used for the city of Tokyo 3 is often played. It's stunning and made the anime come alive.. The same tracks are used for fight scenes. They're okay.\nAnd now..... the characters......\nNeon Genesis Evangelion suffers from really mediocre characters. The main, Shinji, is a wimp. He is the wimpiest wimp I've ever watched in an anime. I never wanted to root for him. Never wanted him to succeed. He's just an absolute waste of a character. Shinji's dad is often incredibly mean to him. Unfortunately, since Shinji isn't a very likeable character, I never felt bad for the way he was treated. It was one of those things where I was just like \"Well... that's what happens when you don't stand up for yourself\". As much as I am criticizing Shinji, I do want to give credit where credit is due. Megumi Ogata, who does the voice of Shinji, has the best scream I've ever heard in any anime. Whenever Shinji screamed in terror or pain, it felt powerful and real. \nOne of the first people Shinji meets is Misato. At first, her character is quite interesting. She is the captain at NERV and portrays herself as a strong female. Sadly, this goes away as the series continues and she becomes a girly girl. It's pretty underwhelming. There are flashes where she becomes that strong character that she was in the beginning, but it never completely goes back to what once was. \nAnd then there's Rei. Poor Rei... When her character is first introduced, she's very quiet and reserved. As the series progresses, this lightly changes, but not by much. She's given several opportunities to shine throughout the series, but ultimately never gets a chance. Everytime Rei gets close to opening up, which may lead to some interesting background for her character, it is suddenly pushed aside and never talked about again. Such a shame.\nWithout a doubt, my favorite character in the series was Asuka. She's a combination of sexy, smart, egotistical, strong, and just plain fun. Asuka was the one character that truly gave this series life. I was always happy when her character appeared on screen. \nUsually, I write what I think about the story at the very top, but I wanted to wait this time due to everything above. So here's an anime with animation that is a little bit above average, has a soundtrack that doesn't work a lot of the time, and contains a cast of main characters that aren't necessarily the most likeable or relatable. The only thing that can save Neon Genesis Evangelion from being just another anime is a great story. Now again, I was told that this series was full of metaphors and philosophical ideas. That's what I was told beforehand, so obviously I expected such. So the big question is, does the story deliver? Well, it depends what you mean. Is the series, as a whole, full of metaphors, philosophical ideas, and weird storytelling...?\nNo... it isn't. I'm someone who LOVES anime that deals with philosophical questions. I enjoy and embrace the weird and odd stuff that people don't understand. It's just fascinating. Some of my favorite anime include Texhnolyze, Casshern Sins, and Serial Experiments Lain. So if anyone was going to love this anime, it would be me. \nHere's the truth....\nAbout a third of Neon Genesis Evangelion is what people brag about - weird. But guess what? That third doesn't come until you're far into the series. What you get beforehand is pretty much the same thing over and over again. Usually the show falls into the category of slice of life comedy, or mecha battles. That's what you get for the majority of Neon Genesis Evangelion. And trust me when I tell you, it gets boring fast. There's never any tension when it comes to the mechs battling monsters. It's obvious what will happen every single time. And when we aren't watching mech battles, the series becomes a slice of life comedy. Now here's the thing - I like slice of life anime. It's actually my favorite genre. The problem is that comedy here is not very good at all. It's poor. And later on, when we make the transition from slice of life comedy/mech battles to weird philosophical anime, it's not a smooth transition at all. It feels out of place. \nNow, from what I've read, apparently the creator of Neon Genesis Evangelion suffered from depression while making this series, which lead the the show becoming darker and darker in tone as it went along. Perhaps some might question whether or that's true. I believe it. I don't think anyone would lie about that sort of stuff, and if the creator says that his depression is the reason that the series became as dark and weird as it did, then I'll take his word. \nWith that said.....\nI'm here to review the story, not the creator's depression. I don't care why the series became as odd as it did. Don't care if it's due to depression, running out of ideas, or just plain stupidity - it doesn't work. The last third of this Neon Genesis Evangelion is absolutely nuts and doesn't make much of any sense. The reason a series like Serial Experiments Lain works is that it has the same tone from beginning to end. It's weird the whole way through. In my opinion, Neon Genesis Evangelion starts off as a comedy, that happens to feature mechs, and turns into a dark nightmare midway through. It's sloppy. Not only that, but I couldn't possibly analyze such an anime. I've heard fans of Neon Genesis Evangelion say that the series reflects upon religion and is a psychological study of man. Well, you could've fooled me. This feels like an art project made by a ton of students with different ideas. It's a mess. \nWould I recommend Neon Genesis Evangelion? I guess. It's not a bad anime, despite my criticisms. It's an entertaining anime with a ton of flaws and a not so satisfying third act. It's also one of the highest rated anime on MAL. So there's no reason to not watch it. The majority of people who have watched the series clearly love it and see stuff in the series that I just don't. But I would definitely watch with caution. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="                          \n    \"This is a giant robot saga the same way Twin Peaks was a cop show.\"\nIt took me awhile, but I finally found the will to watch to what is often considered one of the most influential and greatest anime series of all time: Neon Genesis Evangelion. This show is known for reinventing the mecha genre and made it evolve into what it is today. Now that I am done with it what's my reaction...let’s just say that this required some huge thinking. Note: This is not just a review but is also an analysis of the show. This is going to be a long one.\n          \n        MAJOR SPOILERS LATER IN THE REVIEW.\nArt:\nThe art in Evangelion is absolutely spectacular. People are distinctive and actually are realistically drawn. I was surprised how much detail is in show especially since this was the 90's. Mecha battles are fluid and not jerky at all. Colors are not grey often and overall it's a pretty bright show. There are even sometimes where their is complete silence and we are the viewers are to interpret the scene and appreciate the animation. So the animation probably gets a perfect 10 right...no not at all and it has to do with the ending.\nSound:\nThree Words: BEST OPENING EVA (see what I did there XD). Seriously though, I always skip opening sequences in animes, even for Cowboy Bebop. The Cruel Angel's thesis however, truly is the greatest thing I have ever seen. It's catchy and awesome I love it. Not to mention every episode ends with Fly me to the moon, however, it becomes REALLY unfitting after some episodes that I rather have the episode end in silence. The score is good, not much to say. The voice acting...not bad dubbed, but there were some episodes where I felt the actors performed the lines for the first time and the sound editor decided to just go with it. It's sounds awkward and really bad, but that's not to say the overall dub is bad because it is definitely listenable not to mention the acting is so much better in re-dubs of the show. Overall, sound is great.\nStory and Characters:\nOkay here we go. Time to talk about the overall story and characters in this show because some of you may of heard or probably has seen this show and knows what happens at the end. Before I get to that let me say one thing. The first 16 episodes are really fun to watch. They're pure action and actually some funny comedy. It's just pure unadulterated fun and I honestly wish the whole show was like this...but it's not.\nIn case you don't know, director and writer Hideaki Anno wrote this show as a parallel to the state of depression he was going through at the moment. At first, I thought I was going to love NGE, because I love psychological stories, hell my favorite movie is A Clockwork Orange (you can't get more psychological than that). However, NGE is psychological but the way that it is presented is just terrible. Let me start with another thing about the story of Evangelion. This story is very very very vague and it's one of those instances where you just don't understand the plot at all. My biggest questions all have to do with the villains: The angels. Who are they really? What is their motivation? Are they just fighting robots from space like Transformers, or do they actually have a biological form? What do they want with the humans? When we are told about the Angels, we are only told in passing conversation and that still does not explain anything about who they are and what they want. Next thing you find out is that they are actually part of a philosophical allegory left only to interpretation, which is okay except for the fact I know jack about them.\nAlso, The End of Evangelion, while a better ending to the series and definitely recommended for viewing, is still vague because once again it fails to explain what it is motive for everything that is going on. It’s weird though because the final scene was actually the only scene I understood in the whole movie.\nThen there's the most infamous part of Evangelion: our protagonist Shinji Ikari. Shinji actually has been known to the anime world as probably the most hated character in all of anime and I see why. Simply put he's a whiny little bitch. Although, to be honest, I actually did not hate Shinji that much as I thought I was going to hate him because despite his exterior all he really wants is the world to be happy. He wants to protect everyone and make sure especially he hurts no one. Not to mention he has daddy issues, a very traumatic childhood, and is going through that time of maturation in life. Yes, Shinji is annoying and yes I do hate him but not to the extent that he's a terrible character. However, this leads us to final episodes of Evangelion.\nSo let's see what we got:\nHUGE SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!!\nStudio Gainax was actually going through major financial problems at the time and decided to make the final episodes of Evangelion one giant tacked on psychological case study with cheap visuals and mostly presented in title cards. There are three characters that I want to take time and talk about.\n-Misato Katsuragi is Shinji's guardian during the course of the show. She cares for Shinji and believes that he has much more to him than Shinji's father sets him out to be. However, here is what bothers me about Misato, why does she have her own case study at the end at all. She doesn't need it. Misato is a highly ranked in the NERV unit, she is very beautiful, and Kaji, another member of NERV who can be seen as a brother to Shinji, doesn't mind being her significant other when she is alone. You can argue that the ranking and taking care of Shinji is too much for her, but then again this was her decision and she decided to do this. If she found it to be too much, then she could've easily step down and let someone else in NERV take over for her plus she didn't need to take care of Shinji, in fact the characters even ask her if she can handle him to which she responds what the worse that could happen. On top of all this, she's really a very strong female character in this show and seeing her like this bothers me a lot.\n-Asuka Soryu is the one of the EVA pilots along with Shinji and Rei (BTW I'm not touching Rei because she truthfully didn't have a major case despite the nature of her character). Asuka physically is developed for her age and she uses this to her advantage especially around Kaji who she goes out of her way for. My problem with Asuka is similar to how I feel about Misato: Why does she have a case study? Again she is one of the pilots, she is also very beautiful, and if she wanted to be loved so much then why does she resent Shinji, who actually does like her a lot. Not to mention she is jealous of Shinji when he is around Rei, so is she in major denial and if she is why does this mean that he hates herself after this? Is it because she believes that Shinji is such a loser that seeing him with Rei makes her inferior when she is not at all? This all leads to me believe that Asuka is just stubborn and can't accept anything, but why must her stubbornness affect her psyche, everyone is trying to help her not abuse her. Can't she just move on especially when a lot of high school boys lust over her especially Shinji (seriously there's a infamous scene in the beginning of End of Evangelion that is just eww). Asuka has a lot of to flaunt and the fact that she can't get what she wants and is ungrateful for the things she has just makes me actually hate her more than Shinji.\n-Shinji Ikari is our main character and main psychological focus in this whole show. Where do I begin? Shinji is going through a tough time in his life, he has no mother, and his father decides to put him in control of the EVA so it is justifiable for him to be depressed about himself because this is really some heavy stuff. Three gorgeous females; one who he is fascinated by, one who is fascinated in him, and one who he feels the most passionate with surrounds him. All boys at his age can't get women out of their heads and even more he actually has to live with the two of them, so he gets into numerous situations where he can't control his urges (Once again End of Evangelion). Not to mention he is also jealous of Rei, because Rei has a stronger connection with his father than he does. I would be upset too if my father loved another person before me. To top it all off the fate of the world is on his shoulders. Listen, I hate Shinji because he is meant to be our protagonist, but I can’t blame him at all for not being screwed up because he is, one more time during that infamous End of Evangelion scene he even says to himself, “I’m so F*** up.”\nThere are so many flaws with the psyche with this show that I can’t really see it as something of accurate analysis. Shinji maybe the best head case in this show, but the other characters I don’t find any reason for them to be analyzed. Thus, it’s hard for me to like these characters if their attitudes on life are like this. However, seeing the things that they go through in this show do gives me good reason to believe that there is something wrong with them, but that still can’t excuse how easy these can be avoided.\nEnjoyment:\nThe actual plot and characters psyche may make people uncomfortable and confused about this show, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad. Like I said if the show was actually a fun fighting robot show with a more coherent plot then I would’ve loved it so much more because when it is a fighting robot show, it’s really fun to watch and it was like that for the first 16 episodes of the show and I was enjoying it a lot. Then it got psychological which would’ve been absolutely fine but the delivery is just really bad and full of so many holes that it makes it so hard to enjoy.\nOverall:\nSo far my track record with Studio Gainax has been weird. First, there was FLCL, which I loved a lot because of it being just an experiment of how much bats**t insanity one can handle telling us not to take it seriously at all. Then there was Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann which I already established as my most hated anime of all time being that it was just as bats**t insane as FLCL but tried to take itself seriously when it shouldn’t have. Finally, there is Neon Genesis Evangelion, which I can’t decide whether I really hated or actually really loved it. I would hate NGE because of the fact that the whole ending was completely full of holes, tacked on, and super vague. However, I would love NGE because how much I just analyzed it. Do I recommend it? YES GO WATCH IT NOW! It’s known as one of the greatest animes of all time for a reason and honestly if you watch anime and have not seen this yet then you are missing out big time. However, there is no guarantee at all you are going to like it. Right now, NGE is actually in the process of a rebuild. This rebuild is to actually fix all the flaws people had with the original series. I watched the first movie and it was great, so much better than the series. For now, watch the original series first because it’s better if people knew the roots of this show and see the reason why so many anime fans talk about it. Now if you’ll excuse me this show has made me contemplate my life a lot.\n        "},

So I heard that this one is considered to be a \"masterpiece\" and a \"must watch\" anime, so I thought I give it a try. Oh man, I'm so disappointed. Maybe my next words could contain spoilers.\nAt the very beginning of NGE I had an optimistic intention. The story begins very interesting, there are these Angels and Evas and there was a battle ages ago and now the people are once more offended by the Angels. But when you think that this anime will be an awesome action adventure story with a great protagonist than you\n          \n        arrive at that moment when reality hits hard. Not that I'm not tolerant towards science fiction and serious/complex anime but this one is more like a psychological \"why am I here and what is the sense of life\" anime and I don't like it. \nThe protagonist Shinji is one of the most demotivational and uninspired charackter in anime history. He is whinning almost all the time about himself and his unnecessarity. The last episodes deals with questions like \"are you confident?\" Do you want to live? Do you hate yourself? I see the potential of this anime, it wants to be well structured and entirely complex but in the end it is too abstract and confusing.\nTo end this review I can say that you should watch this anime if you like psychological and paranoid anime with discussions of your feelings and interpretations of the human being, but if you want to watch an anime with an adventure action story, with frightning moments and strong and confident charackters you should watch other anime, maybe Kanabari of the iron fortress or attack on titan. \n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    \"Am i actually ready for this?\" That was the thought that crossed my mind when i decided to rewatch Evangelion for the next review. Now, after some time passed and i went through it all again, i am still not sure. Smarter People then me analyzed this show and all it's hidden messages, page-long essays float around on the net. But i will still try it, cause what i can start off with is that Neon Genesis Evangelion is a part of my personal Top 5 list. And i never had the chance yet to just release my inner fanboy. If you want an objective\n          \n        look on a polarizing Anime, then i am afraid you have to turn around and leave. \nStory: The story is straightforward. It's also jumbled and really complicated. Its genuinely funny. And it's crippling, depressive. Basically, it's like a rollercoaster, ups and downs, until it's only down, right into hell's maw. But then everything seems to be good again and we are left utterly confused but also kinda relieved. There is no conclusion at the end, no explanation of the events. There still isn't, even after the End of Evangelion and all the Rebuild-movies. But it doesn't matter, the story is just a stage, the couch in the therapists room, where all our characters can lie down and spill their souls. This is what Evangelion is about, not the fight against the angels, not the schemes of Gendo Ikari and Seele. They all just serve as a driving force and in the end, Evangelion abandons all of these pretenses and just looks into the characters as a final case study. And that is okay, it's amazing even, however the Story section is certainly the weakest part of the show, which doesn't mean its bad, no, it is very good.\nArt: For an older show with heavy budget-constraints, Evangelion looks amazing. Be it backgrounds, animations, character-design, everything is an own piece of art. Everything in motion looks great, at times fantastical, then just really down to earth. However, there are a lot of still frames, most likely to manage the limited funds. It never takes you out of the experience though, quite the opposite and adds to Evangelions charm. When Rei and Asuka ride an elevator for almost a minute, without saying a word or moving at all, then you can either call that lazy or just an interesting display of a very awkward situation between characters, who can't stand each other. I choose the latter, so in conclusion, the art is great.\nSound: The Sound is insane, it's fantastic, the OST enhances every scene, supports them or sometimes, just completely contadicts them. Even then it just works. The Opening is downright iconic, nearly everyone who enjoys anime has probably heard it at some point. And the Ending, \"fly me to the moon\", a classic, changed for the show in as many variations as there are episodes. So the music is great, all the other sounds as well, weapons sound nice, the Angels, when they display noises, they sound really weird, otherworldly. The last words i have are for the voice acting, it's brilliant, the characters sound real in a sense and i never heard such desperate cries in an anime. So in terms of the score, the Sound is outstanding and that's not even enough to describe it.\nCharacters: If i could, i'd give this category, like, a 12 or something. The Characters are that good. When i first watched this show, Shinji seemed like a copy of myself, i recognized myself in a lot of his dialogue or just dialogue other characters had about him. Well, i got better, but i can still appreciate just how realistic Shinji actually is. Not only him, while i never shared Misatos or Asukas problems, i realize that these are real issues that some people face in their lives. While it is taken up a notch, simply for drama and as a reminder that this is still a piece of entertainment, it still remains that image of real people. Yet the characters are not always likable, they can be annoying, they can be detestable, they can be selfish, but of course they are, they are only human. Well, except that they are not, but what they are is realistic, all of them, the only one i'd almost exclude from that are Gendo and Rei. I have trouble describing my feelings here, as i said, smarter people talked about these characters, i suppose you should listen to their thoughts on this matter. All that is left for me is to praise it.\nEnjoyment: That is actually not the word i would choose for my experience. Sometimes, i felt really bad, really uncomfortable watching this, cause in a sense it's TOO real. If you're looking to escape your troubles, if you don't want to think about existential questions, i'd stay away. But i would never advise that, take the challenge, expand your horizons and know that in the end, you might gain something. I like the ending, by the way. As much of a meme it is by now, i think it's a great last note to end it on. Never was i bored in this show, not for a second, so i can only call my Enjoyment outstanding. After all, Enjoyment doesn't mean that you felt happy all the time.    \nSo i laid down my thoughts. I understand that i probably missed a lot, the reason being, that there just is a lot to talk about. I could probably fill 10 pages with my views on Evangelion and i would even enjoy it, but this is not the place, so i tried to restrain myself. I am only left to say this: watch it. You don't even have to like it, but everyone should have watched this. It will stay with you, whether you loved it or hated it, it's certainly unforgettable and just a part of anime as a medium. \n        "},

		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    Before even watching any kind of TV series or movies, we always have expectations. Of course, we also get a “feeling” about how the show will progress by reading about it somewhere on the Internet or watching the first few episodes before building up our “requirements”. However, twists and turns don’t actually contribute to these expectations because they are generally more story-related, not content-related. The content is everything that the show has or is currently offering us, from characterization, to storyline, to animation and audio. Now you may be wondering what this is all about. Why should “expectations” matter? We should just watch and then\n          \n        judge, right? But on what basis? People’s opinions? No. Expectations. If you don’t expect the show to have a good set of characters, and if by any chance they turn out the other way around, then you will be surprised that this actually exceeded your expectation from the characters. It was twisted around, but in a positive way because the characters didn’t turn out the way you expected. If, however, you expect the series to show you something it promised but unfortunately failed then it’s an entirely different matter. Yes, we’re talking about Neon Genesis Evangelion, a show that promises everything but ironically presents absolutely nothing. NGE is all about one thing: False promises.\nThis review is spoiler free.\nLet’s talk about what NGE actually promised us, the viewers. Character development is the first thing that comes in mind, because the main character is portrayed as a weak, self-absorbed and depressed individual with parent issues on top of that, who must overcome his weaknesses. There it is, “overcome”. And the show clearly emphasizes on that single word by constantly proving to us that he’s beginning to change, only of course he doesn’t at the end and stays the same. But we’ll get to that later. A secondary expectation is the action scenes, since it is a shonen after all, even if it tries to deconstruct the genre. Finally, there is one primordial requirement: a comprehensible story. This may sound vague right now, but we’ll talk about it in a moment. Right now, imagine reading a book with torn up pages. That’s how NGE felt like, not just to me, but to everyone who has watched it so far. Some people enjoy this sort of thing, and I don’t mind it either if it’s kept at a minimum level but there’s a difference between “contributing to the story” and “creating your own”. NGE used symbolism and philosophy on top of a somewhat “normal story” to make you confused and lost, but in my opinion it did more harm than good because it didn’t bother exploring those elements. They were just out of context so everyone tried to twist them around to their own liking. Personally, it is a nightmare for me to assemble a puzzle when I’m actually missing some pieces. It’s frustrating, and the only solution is to fill the missing pieces with something else, something that I MADE. \n•STORY: Let’s cut to the chase. The story was like a roller-coaster that derailed at the end of the track; this is the best way that I can describe it. NGE begins on a promising premise, becomes a bit repetitive, but gets interesting again, and then finally loses its charm. It jumps from an unusual shonen where the main character has to overcome his weaknesses and solve his relationship with his father (this was my supposed expectation from the show) to a deep philosophical show where every single character whines and talks about his feelings and thoughts. What happened to the story and its objectives? It was thrown away from the window and replaced with depressive materials where the 14-year old characters speak as if they were divorced twice and lost their job. Yes, Shinji is supposed to be the writer’s projection into the show, but this sudden shift from one genre to another was irrelevant to the story. It was tiresome, because we already know how the characters feel and act in the show. We don’t need another set of episodes explaining the obvious. \nThis is not how psychological drama progresses. We’re supposed to anticipate the person’s feelings and thoughts through his interactions, actions, decisions, and ultimately relationships. And we already did in the first part of the show. It was beautifully presented, I admit. Unfortunately, NGE decides that it’s not enough and continues on its journey by pretty much summarizing the entire thing again instead of developing it. The characters constantly paraphrase ONE single thing. There is no development, no progress in the story. It even gives us a slight moment of false hope when Shinji was praised by his father who told him that he did a great job, and that was it. Shinji remembers this moment again later on, but then nothing happens afterwards. They both stay stagnant and their relationship doesn’t go anywhere. So what’s the point of watching a show if you constantly want to feel let down? \nBut this is just the tip of the iceberg. NGE had an acceptable story but rushed its ending in an almost comical way. It introduced a Deus Ex Machina character at the last second and suddenly everything was “resolved”. The two last episodes are not even qualified to be called “episodes” (budget issues) and barely tried to convey a message. On the other hand, NGE has a tendency to “tease” the viewer by throwing at him unexplained words. No, not feeding him information. Just words. Like “Human Instrumentality Project”, “Dummy Plug”, “SEELE”, “Angels”, “Adam”, “EVA”… Some of these words are ambiguous as they can be interpreted in a different way each time, but others are just unacceptable. Throwing words at the viewer without at least giving him some highlights makes the story look poor and weak, not mysterious nor deep. I admit that I was so frustrated when they kept using these words without explaining anything at all that I decided to look up the information on the Wikia fandom page. So enough teasing, get the point already.\nSo beside the plot being a bit frustrating at some point, the psychological aspect of the show worked at first but was prolonged to fill more episodes. The story began simple but then was filled with useless symbolism to make it look like more than “just a story”. It failed however at delivering its message because everything was rushed at the end and the last two episodes were a joke (there’s a reason why they made an alternate ending and the movies, people!). The story wasn’t some form of allegory, because nothing was highlighted or given any meaning at all. It was pure teasing of religious references, unexplained elements and classical music.\n•CHARACTERS: The characters are not bad per se, they just seem analogous. Most of them are heavily depressed and have parent issues, and there’s only one aspect that really separates them from one another. Also, new characters are introduced conveniently and too quickly by a simple phrase: “We found the one!” without a decent explanation of how they were found.\n-Shinji: First of all, Shinji is not a bad character. Sure, he has his weaknesses, strengths and dilemmas but this is what makes him special. And this is exactly why many people despise or love him. He’s different than your average main character from any shonen. But this doesn’t mean he’s perfect. Yes, he’s supposed to be portrayed that way so he can feel realistic and more human because he makes irrational decisions, complains about everything yet secretly desire human contact. He has all the right to do these sort of things, but I don’t think he has the right to waste our time. The fate of the world rests in his hands, and what does he do? He goes to school! Instead of training hard, he wastes almost half of his screen time with his school friends when the world is two inches away from being extinct. And ironically enough, he complains that he’s lonely and weak. He also runs away more than once from NERV because he’s actually scared (and that’s fine) but comes back like it was nothing. So his characterization which was excused because he was clearly presented as an “imperfect human being” became underwhelming, even for him. \nSo at first glance, Shinji may seem closer than a human than a fictional character, but in reality he’s just a cheap excuse for the writer to project himself into the story. That’s why the second part of the show only focuses on Shinji’s psychological state. And his nihilistic view of the world remains the same. Why? Because that’s how the writer sees it, and wants you to see it in this way. So I wouldn’t call it “character development”. Even if we clearly notice that Shinji is actually making progress (Meeting new friends, protecting them, having his first kiss…), he denies it! And we’re back at square one. Again, it’s a false promise. His thoughts, emotions and attitude remain the same. Even if he has almost everything that he desired a long time ago, he’s still not happy about it. \n-Rei: I wouldn’t call her a character because she acts like walking puppet. No personality, no emotions, no reactions, and this seemed to be the trend back then. Absolutely nothing that can characterize her beside her name and her “true identity”, but I won’t spoil anything. \n-Asuka: She doesn’t actually contribute anything to the story. Everything that she says or does is because she wants someone to praise and acknowledge her as a human being. And this becomes irritating because we already have a character like her. It’s Shinji. Asuka doesn’t add anything new to the drama. She just magnifies it. It’s like stacking up several “Shinjis” on top of each other: it’s a character amplification. At some point, the show insists on her being Shinji’s rival as she constantly tries to overpower him so she can get all the attention for herself. So if she adds anything new to her character, it’s jealousy. She can’t stand not being the first and most powerful EVA pilot. \nMoreover, some of her actions and decisions don’t make an ounce of sense, like deciding to kiss Shinji because she “was bored”. Sounds like she’s a fanservice material to me.\n-Nagisa: A Deux Ex Machina who is conveniently introduced at the end and appears for no more than 10 minutes during the whole show so he can unexpectedly provide a lazy solution to the story. He’s not a character but more of physical key to the story and he was poorly handled. He was forced to interact with Shinji for a few minutes so he can leave a good impression on him. But it was JUST a few minutes, and this made Shinji thought of Nagisa as his own brother.\n-Gendou Ikari: He’s always asking for the impossible, as he expects his 14-year old son to pilot a giant robot and fight aliens while he sits in his chair with a dead expression. If he was supposed to be some sort of an analogy of a strict and authoritative father in real-life then he clearly isn’t, because I don’t think any person with a functional brain would ask a child, let alone his son, to instantly turn into a soldier without a proper training or mentor. Sure, some parents push their kids a little bit too much but I’ve never seen a parent asking his kid to pilot an airplane. Have you?\n•ANIMATION: The art is decent but the animation is rather disappointing to say the least, even if we take into consideration that the show is more than 20 years old. At first, the animation didn’t look that bad, but then we started starring at static images for up to 2 whole minutes. And it wasn’t to build up tension. It just made 1 second feel like 1 hour. But I wasn’t that annoyed, because the animation budget ran out… that is until I watched the last two episodes. Ah. Another false promise. \nInstead of actually wrapping things up in the last few episodes, they decided to throw some poorly made sketches, flash some images here and there, while also adding some voices to still frames on a black background so they can stall for time. At that moment, the animation was no more “understandable” nor excusable. It was embarrassing and barely tried to conclude the story which at this point felt more like broken glass. \n•SOUND: Voice acting was good for most characters. The opening is also great but doesn’t really fit the theme of the story. Remember, the second part of the show is heavily depressing and dark. So it’s not your typical, good-ending shonen at all, and I don’t think that the boy “became a legend” at the end, because honestly there was no ending, and the boy remained pretty much the same. \n•ENJOYEMENT: I enjoyed NGE at first, especially the action scenes. Most dialogues between characters were somewhat interesting and mature while monologues were constant paraphrasing and a waste of time. I didn’t dislike the characters, but some of them were a waste of screen time and money, especially the school friends, Asuka and even the Penguin guy. Some animated scenes were decent, others were a complete disaster. So right now, NGE seems like any average show. It has its ups and downs. Except…\nThere was one thing that I, and many others, couldn’t stand. It’s the poorly explained story who barely tried to provide the viewer with information and constantly shifts between psychological drama (which was supposed to be the main theme) and philosophical fiction that mainly focuses on negative and dark themes such as pessimism, nihilism and cynicism.  \nIn conclusion, NGE promised us character development, explanation of the mysterious elements that were continuously thrown at us, and a decent ending (which is the upmost and basic requirement of every storytelling) but gave us nothing in return. Even though it’s highly praised by many, I still can’t recommend it to anyone who wants:\n-An acceptable character progression\n-A properly explained story with a decent ending – A “Straight to the point” approach\nOf course, if you’re still curious then you can try it out, but this is what you’ll be getting as a result:\n-Stagnant characters who remain the same \n-A barely explained story with no ending – A “Do it yourself” approach\n-Unnecessary and irrelevant philosophical elements that become repetitive\n-Disappointing animation, even considering how old the show is\nHowever, if you like reading a torn up book and fill the missing pages, this show is for you."},

(My grammer is bad so deal with it if you want to read this)\nContains spoilers if you actually care \nStory 1: The premise of the story is not bad,hell, I would even go as far as to give it a 8 or 9 at most, but the way this story tells it I hate. Shinji who father leaves him and doesn't even bother to care for him calls him to HQ, tells him to ride the Eva,\n          \n        he has some tantrum thing after some time of self loathing he decides to do it, then the rest of the story starts. He fights the Angels well complaining inside and outside about doing it, fights them. The fight scenes are pretty good at the start but end up being shit towards the end. Like dog shit bad. When they had to destroy the 16th angel they just had to throw something really fast at it while it was destroying Asuka mind. They lose some all powerful weapon and it's over. The only good thing I remember from the fights is when shinji came out of that ball like angel rips open it from the inside out and jumps out all badass like, that was fucking awesome. \nNow Some thing I hate about the story, the part were Toji becomes the fourth child, and when Kaworu joins the team. Here is why, they last for one ep and then have no relevance on anything past that. Toji becomes the fourth child we have like 2-3 ep foreshadowing this he comes into the pilot seat shit goes down he goes out of control, Shinji almost kills him because he wasn't in control over his Eva, he gets upsets, says he gonna leave (I also want to mention that he is never seen again or talked about for the rest of the show, like what was the point of all of that), runs off says he is never piloting the Eva again, sees Asuka and Rei get there ass whooped, runs to help, beats the shit out of the angel, but ahhh  he fusing with the god damn Eva. Like can you believe that, I couldn't because it makes no fucking sense and if it did he shouldn't be alive and come back afterwards which was bullshit. How does he still have conscious and then just get pooped out by the Eva like, \"oh shit here you go\". Then when Kaworu joins he meets Shinji, they form some deep bond that could be easily mistaken for some gay shit, BL stuff, then at the end of the ep we get, oh shit I am actually the 17th angel STEELE has control over for some non explained reason and then takes control over the Eva soul? which then he uses to go to the bottom of the base to see adam while fighting shinji, shinji is upset thinking Kaworu has betrayed him but I don't give a shit because he only joined this ep and the relationship seems so forced. He sees adam, rei takes down his AT field for some non explained reason, he says he wants to join adam, then says this after examining the body, huh this is what the humans are doing or something like that then doesn't join adam for some UNEXPLAINED FUCKING REASON, shinji grabs him,Kaworu asked to be killed, then we get like a full 2 or 3 mins clip, which seems like fucking eternity, where he just hold him and the shot zooms out then kills him. Up to this point I really don't care what's gonna happen makes the ending interesting alright. Boy was I wrong\nOkay the ending wasn't bad to say it was just horrible. I mean I am fine with 2 ep of seeing character argue with themselves about why they are all insecure fucks that are starved for attention and want to be loved because they all have sad pasts, but everyone does, your not fucking special Asuka, Rei,Shinji,Misato. The main issue is that this is the ending. Like wtf was the point of every other eps. Was it just to have them spiral into pathetic losers who then review there life choices at the end of the series and that's it? Fuck that. The ending was bad, case closed.\nArt 7: Aired in 1995 isn't gonna be the best but wasn't bad, I kinda liked it. The only thing I liked about this show was the art. Animation is another story but it's fine. \nSound 5: Nothing special the OP is kinda good, the OST is alright enough to make me not bored with the show but this show some times doesn't have music and just uses sound effects at times, so it's eh.\nCharacters -10: Fuck all of these character expect Toji, and Kaji (I love them) but ever other character is bad. If I talked about personal problems such as how much I hate Asuka I can talk about that for a hour and have that own review but I won't so ima just say a few things. I hate the characters, there either bland,annoying or useless. Every character beside Kaji falls under one of those if not more traits. Asuka falls under all 3 but that's because she is a bad character. Lets just talk about the MC and Ritsuko for this part. All the main cast are just brats that have had sad pasts that are starved for attention. They all pretty much are like this. Shinji just wants to be loved because his father didn't care for him as a child and he thinks if he pilots the Eva people will like him but throughout the series has complicated emotions about piloting it. Which is dumb and pointless because when he runs away he comes back in like the next ep or the end of the ep to pilot the Eva again. I hate his character. Rei, well I don't wanna talk about her because I didn't even really remember anything about her because she is a dull character. Asuka in shit *cough cough*, Asuka acts like a stuck up bratty bitch who acts that way because her mother committed suicide because the father didn't care for her or some shit, that seems like an issue she had, she was traumatized afterwards and wants to act like an adult so people will look at her because she is a drama queen. People often told me that Asuka character is justified to act that way because of her past. Her past in no way justifies her bratty annoying self and anyone who like her as a character I have two words for you. Fuck you. That's it. Misato, father died in the second impact or something she was traumatized, didn't speak for a whole two years blah blah blah, goes to college later in life, talkative as hell gets a boyfriend my man Kaji, fuck him for a whole week, dumps him because he was like her father. Now my problem with her is this. Her whole drama thing I could care less about because it's dumb as hell, when she was dating Kaji he started to remind her of her father and then dumps him because of it if I remember correctly (if I'm wrong it something similar to that at least), because of her daddy issues as a kid, because of all of this she self loathes her self like every other character in this damn show but tries to escape using romance and pleasure,because of this, she feels that she is a slut, and continues this cycle over and over really never finding happiness. (I just wanna say I want a full length video about the end of ep 20). Then we have Ritsuko whos character I really hate, not her really but how she acts at the end of the series because her drama seems so fake,like, her love for shinji father comes out of nowhere he mental issues also come out of nowhere and it is just dumb.  \nEnjoyment 0: There were some stuff I liked, like they fight in ep 19, all of ep 20, and that one scene where sjinji rips that angel from the inside out, but other then that, fuck this series.\n        "},

Let me make one fact perfectly clear: If you think Evangelion isn't worthy of praise because the story is \"boring\" or \"confusing\", the characters are \"unlikeable\" or \"annoying,\" the entire work is \"pretentious,\" or anything of the sort, you are a complete and total moron with shit taste. If you can't handle this little fact, downvote\n          \n        this review and get on with the harsh realities of your miserable life. Now that we have all the ruffians out of the way, let's talk about what is bar none, one of the most influential programmes to ever be released.\nBefore I get on with the rest of the review, let's talk a little bit about depth. A lot of people mockingly say that Evangelion is \"2deep4u\" but here's the thing: Evangelion IS deep. I like to think that Evangelion (and virtually every single form of entertainment that currently exists) operates on two levels: the \"surface\" level which deals with the story and characters at face value and the \"deep\" layer where one can draw parallels between the show and other things if you were to analyse the story a little more than someone else would. It's important to note that the \"deep\" layer isn't crucial to one's enjoyment of the programme. You can watch Evangelion without having to analyse every single aspect of the show. Unfortunately, a lot of these negative reviews just talk about the story at face value without bothering to factor in some context.\nUnless you've grown up in the late 80s and early 90s or have consciously made the effort to go out there and watch older anime, it's hard to see exactly how influential Evangelion was to the industry. Genre breakdowns and meta-commentaries are so commonplace in anime these days to the point where people fail to realise that it was a trend Evangelion pioneered. Why is this? Well, Evangelion is the brainchild of a clinically depressed and extremely frustrated animator who grew disillusioned with otakus. He decided to take the two things that otakus violently masturbated to (in this case, mecha and harem programmes) and decided to shatter their sick, twisted fantasies. What do I mean by this? Well, let's think about it for a moment.\nThe whole point of Evangelion is to see how things would play out if the world really was in a post-apocalyptic situation and the fate of humankind rested on the shoulders of teenagers who have to put up with the burdens of adolescence and society whilst having to save the world with virtually no sympathy whatsoever. People rag on Shinji all the time for being a gutless coward who runs away from his problems, but guess what? That's the point! He's a kid with a slew of psychological problems being forced to pilot a giant robot with no prior training whatsoever in order to fight otherworldly creatures that could very well KILL HIM. I don't care if you think you're up to the task of becoming a giant robot pilot. If you were in Shinji's exact circumstances, you'd be chanting \"I mustn't run away\" before every Angel fight.\nOn that note, let's talk about Shinji. He's not a gutless coward, he's someone deserving of our sympathy and he's a lot braver than people give him credit for. Now that we got the inherently obvious out of the way, let's talk about what a lot of people DON'T talk about in regards to Shinji. A lot of people complain about how anime these days are full of wimpy characters who do nothing but complain and hesitate during fights (i.e. Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul, Yukki from Mirai Nikki), but guess what? Shinji was the very progenitor of that character archetype. Do keep in mind that I'm NOT saying that Kaneki and Yukki are on the same level as Shinji, I'm merely stating that there's a parallel that can be drawn between them and Shinji.\nBefore Evangelion was made, the bulk of male lead characters were confident Gary Stu-like characters or just straight-up MANLY. That's all fine and dandy, but the problem is that the bulk of anime fans who watched those shows were the complete opposite of characters like Jotaro Kujo. Instead of being confident and manly individuals, the bulk of anime fans back then (to my understanding, at least) were socially inept introverts who were using things like Jojo's Bizarre Adventure as an escapist fantasy of sorts. Evangelion was the first show to come around and give these pathetic losers their own pathetic loser to empathise with instead of a GAR character that they wish they were. Even though Shinji was a pathetic loser, that didn't stop the pathetic losers IRL from using him as a self-insert character. You see, THAT'S what makes Evangelion so great in the first place.\nRemember what I said about Evangelion destroying everything those mouth-breathing otakus loved? Well guess how they did so? By using our boy Shinji to get these losers to insert themselves into this show without realising that their precious little fantasies would be shattered mercilessly. Evangelion breaks down common tropes and archetypes like the aggressive tsundere and the teenage mecha pilot and shows what would most likely happen if they were real people living in a post-apocalyptic scenario. Through this, we find out that being a teenage mecha pilot is anything BUT a walking sex fantasy and that characters like the aggressive tsundere, the bandage chick, and so on and so forth are in fact, real women who don't require a filthy otaku's semen-encrusted penis to feel validated.\nAll of the extra stuff like the religious symbolism and the surreal imagery have no bearing on the actual substance of the show. Anyone who thinks otherwise is a complete and total moron, and I don't think a lot of Eva fans would beg to differ on that matter. When Hideaki Anno said that this show has no depth, he was referring to the fact that people were over-analysing things that were just thrown into the show because they looked cool. The true substance of Evangelion comes from the many personal struggles that the characters go through which many of us also experience in real life. Unfortunately, this little detail seems to be lost amongst the myriad of negative reviews for this programme.\nSpeaking of the characters, the other characters on the show like Rei, Asuka, Misato, Gendo, among others were quite delightful. Asuka’s behaviour was certainly insufferable but it was quite interesting to see a studio actually demonstrate how unhealthy being a violent tsundere actually is. The air of mystery surrounding Rei was interesting to say the least, and what’s more is that her characterisation actually shows just how creepy and unnerving being an emotionless and completely submissive person actually is (although it should be noted that Rei actually does have emotions, but she never knew how to express them properly). Then again… the fact that she’s completely and totally submissive might be the reason why Rei was so popular among the otakus that Anno so viscerally despised. Yeah, I suppose it’s safe to say that Rei is the subject of many a demented pervert’s rape fantasies. I could go on to talk about the other characters, but there are a whole lot of other reviews out there that talk about that in much greater detail than I’d care to talk about. So let’s just skip over to the production.\nEvangelion was a victim of Gainax’s poor accounting practices at the time, which meant that they were given an extremely limited budget to work with (which was exhausted before the final episodes were ever made). For what it’s worth, the Evangelion producers did a great job with what they were given. Action-heavy scenes are animated with such a remarkable degree of fluidity to the point where it makes Cowboy Bebop look like Oruchuban Ebichu. Seriously, look at any of the Eva battles and you’ll see that the production quality holds up quite well to this day. Of course, this means that there were a LOT of corners cut with the animation (especially in dialogue-heavy and atmospheric scenes). Personally, I don’t really mind this approach whatsoever. It only ever gets tedious when we get treated to nothing but silence and a bunch of stills of Shinji doing absolutely nothing and as the series progresses, we get fewer and fewer of those scenes as it starts showing just how fucked up everything is.\nSound-wise, Evangelion delivers in full force. The OST is comprised of lighthearted melodies that get played quite often in the first few episodes when Evangelion is establishing the setting, but then the focus of the OST changes over to bone-chilling atmospheric tracks and bombastic battle themes that never cease to get the blood a-pumpin’. “Cruel Angel’s Thesis” is without a doubt, one of the most memorable opening themes ever and it perfectly encapsulates everything that this show has to offer. The ending theme though gets on my nerves because of the fact that it just felt so dissonant with the tone of the later episodes. Then again, there are probably a LOT of Eva fans out there that are gonna try coming to Ontario just to find and murder me for making such a statement. Oh well, such is life I suppose.\nWould I say that I enjoyed this programme? Well, yeah! Evangelion is one of those programmes that takes a little bit of time to warm up to, but once it gets into gear, you’ll  be begging for the next episode to actually air. Then again… if you can’t get past the characters and the atmospheric feel of the first few episodes, you’d be better off watching Attack on Titan like the tasteless casual you are! Anyway, I’m just gonna wrap up this review now. See ya later.\n***\nIf you’re wondering why I didn’t talk about the TV series’ ending, there’s a good reason why.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    After having watched the series 3 times, I have come up to an ultimate review on the anime series, ''Neon Genesis Evangelion''. \nSTORY\nNeon Genesis Evangelion has a very interesting concept to its story line; at first glance, its theme may seem to be mecha-like, but in fact, it is much MORE symbolic and VERY philosophical; I will review the visual and mental aspect of Neon Genesis Evangelion more in-depth, as I think it is more about that, rather than the physical aspect. \nNow on to the visual and  mental theme of the series; Neon Genesis Evangelion is mainly about Ikari Shinji (the main character),\n          \n        and his mind; the philosophy discussed throughout Neon Genesis Evangelion accounts for; individuality and identity, consciousness, true fear, the existence of Evas and Angels, loneliness, the existence of mankind itself, freedom, and choice; these sub-themes are what is expressed thoroughly in the series, Shinji explores these sub-themes throughout his journey - the mind; Shinji doubts himself, what he is truly capable of, but progressively learns what the true him is, he overcomes his true fear; being alone and having a fake identity, to which he conquers, going through many hardships, and tragic and sorrowful events. It is not just Shinji that experiences this aswell, other characters besides Shinji experience these sub-themes, this includes; Misato Katsuragi (Shinji's ''guardian''), Akagi Ritsuko (The head scientist of NERV), Rei Ayanami (The First Child; pilot of Unit 00), and Soryu Asuka Langely (The Second Child; pilot of Unit 02). \nMisato experiences loneliness herself and also has a fake identity, her childhood consisted of her father not having a paternal relationship with her, and her mother ignoring her, she    then wants to act like a good child to make her parents proud of her, albiet with no success, so she wants to ''disgrace herself'', which leads to her having a sexual relationship with her now-former love ''Ryoji Kaji''. In reference to this, she only ''uses'' men to soothe her lonely heart and to forsake her identity, which is also why she takes in Shinji. \nRitsuko Akagi; follows in her mother's foot steps, unrequited love(?) for Ikari Gendo, lack of care=loneliness, since her mother is the creator of MAGI, she has high expectations, she does not follow in 2 of the 3 categories of the identity of her mother; mother, and woman, she can not realise this because of Ikari Gendo, whom she feels she can rest at ease when he is with her, just like her mother, but she then truly realises this, thus, her not being able to confront with anyone, leading her to a lonely life, and a false sense of individuality and identity, this and coupled with the expectations left behind by her late mother and everyone else.\nAsuka; again, also experiences loneliness and also fears being ignored and shut-off from the world. During her childhood, her mother was very sick, and would use a doll as a substitute for her own daughter, and even her true daughter. Her mother, being very sick, commits suicide, where Asuka sees her death first-hand, traumatizing her, she even overhears the doctors that treated on her mother, as they are now her surrogate parents, they did not act like one and talked like one, leading to Asuka being bossy, wanting to showcase herself to the world so she can not be alone, so that no one will forget her and leave her again. \nRei Ayanami; false identity and individuality and also later realises that she does fear being lonely. Rei Ayanami is ''created'' from the basis of Shinji's mother, although she is a ''fake'' human, she does not mind if she does die, as she was created for solely for one purpose, to... (sorry, do not want to spoil this bit), but comes to regret her decision to die when the ''promised'' day comes, thus, enticing her as a human and being afraid of loneliness, wanting to feel affection.  \nThe series also has representations of Christianity; the Angels (messengers of God), the cross (crucifixion of Jesus), Evas and title itself, Evangelion (biblical gospels), the Second Impact (Adam), Lilith (first wife of Adam), Lance of Longinus (spear used to pierce Jesus), these are all symbolic meanings to Christianity that is visually displayed throughout the series.\nAnother philosophical theme is also represented, but rather on Shinji's introverted nature, and his relationship with Misato Katsuragi and others; the Hedgehog dilemma.\nNow, for the physical aspect of the series, I will not write too much, as the series focuses more on the visual and mental aspect of the series, so here it goes; Neon Genesis Evangelion is packed with action, almost every episode has an Angel to defeat, which should fulfill people's mouths who view fighting, action and 24/7 blazing it is everything to a series/film, but the action scenes were done quite well, each encounter had difficult problems to solve, you would never believe how they could overcome such encounters, which was very original and unique to the story of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Also, although few, the comedy scenes were quite funny\nI also feel that although the series portrays Shinji as a ''wimp'', or a weakling, you have to emphasis on the fact that he is a 14 year-old adolescent, who is immediately shown to and ''forced'' to pilot this big-ass robot to defeat this scary-looking monster, this and coupled with him having so many expectations of him from the other characters, applies a huge deal of pressure on him, making him seem like a wimp or a weakling, what would you do if you were in his situation? He even witnessed crushing his own friend to death(?)...  \nART \nThe art may not seem too great in today's standards, but that kind of art and animation was how it was done back in the 90s, and it was expressed beautifully. \nThe ending scene for each episode (credits) was very well done, how the background synchronized with the character. The settings of the series was also done very well, I liked viewing the semi-futuristic machinery, equipment, and buildings of how it was thought of back in the 80s/90s, it felt pretty dystopian and sci-fi, and had a cozy atmosphere surrounding it. \nAlso, each episode displayed amazing visuals, especially during the psychological scenes, the art represented the distress of the character and how or what they would overcome the philosophy represented in the series, it synchronized very well with the themes and sub-themes presented in the series.\nSOUND \nNever have I skipped the opening theme and ending theme for Neon Genesis Evangelion, the opening theme had a very nostalgic feel to it, the conjoining of different instruments  to create that jazz-like music felt very pleasing, the artist's voice also fit in very well with the opening theme, coupled with the angelic-harmonic like voice, fits the both the physical and visual/mental aspects of the series' themes and sub-themes. \nThe ending theme also had that jazz music and blues-like music to it, although I may be biased for jazz music, that song played during the ending credits simply felt fascinating, it contrasted with the film's philosophical and its settings aspects, it was very relaxing and cool.  \nThe soundtracks fitted in naturally; it combined with the background settings, the equipment utilised in the series, the destruction, the psychological scenes, the character's voice, etc.. It was all natural, I did not detect an irregularity in the sound of the series. \nI also like how the opening starts of as gentle, then wild; then, the ending just relaxes you, quelling your thirst after an episode, not many anime series do this, which makes Neon Genesis Evangelion unique in its choice and style of music.   \nCHARACTER\nCharacter plot and development is amazing in the series, in most anime series, it is only the protagonist that grows and develops, but Neon Genesis Evangelion defies that rule; not just Ikari Shinji, but the other characters; Misato Katsuragi, Akagi Ritsuko, Soryu Asuka Langely, and Rei Ayanami, all experience psychological events that cover the philosophical themes represented in Neon Genesis Evangelion; loneliness, individuality and identity, etc... (just read sub heading ''STORY'') \nEach character's appearances also matched their personality; \nMisato wearing tank top and short shorts, coupled with her drinking and behaviour, and the amount of instant food and beer cans at her home, makes her represent as a flirty, lazy and sloppy character (which she is at her home), but when she is doing professional work, she wears military personnel-like apparel. \nRitsuko wearing a lab coat classifies her as a scientific-engineering-like person. \nShinji wearing his shirt tucked in his pants represents his weak demeanor in his mind and as an innocent kid, but since he is a kid, he also dresses differently at his home. \nAsuka wearing a long dress, symbolises her bossy rich-girl like attitude, short  shorts because she wants attention. \nRei Ayanami most wearing the same clothes because of her strict, serious personality. \nAs you can see, each character is expressed differently, and most have back stories and a lot of developing. \nENJOYMENT \nYou will definitely enjoy watching this series if you are a fan of psychological, thriller, mecha(half-half), action, and mystery. Also, if you like jazz or blues music, I would recommend you watching this, as the series incorporates good music that fits with the visuals of the series. Although the art and animation does not fit today's standards, you will definitely enjoy watching this if you do not mind watching 80s and 90s animation style. Since character development is clearly shown, I'm guessing most people who would like to watch this show will absolutely enjoy this, the characters also fit in naturally with the story, so it's all good! \nOVERALL \nUltimately, Neon Genesis Evangelion has a great concept in terms of its story; which showcases both the physical and visual/mental aspect of the series (philosophical and symbolic meanings), the art; although old, it is quite good if you do not mind it and emphasize, the sound; jazz and blues music is quite good, I dare say so, and the beautiful angelic-harmonic voice, and the beast soundtracks, character; yes, a lot of character back stories on the protagonists, and their development, enjoyment; definitely enjoy watching this because of the sub-headings discussed earlier.  \nSo, the rating is...\nRate: 11/10 :D OVER 100%!!!"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This is literally the hardest review I'll ever give, and there are several reasons for this. The biggest reason that resonates the most is the viewership reaction, because of how wide-spread, varied, and divisive it is. Anything I would say about it could potentially set someone off, whether it's justifiable or not. It's funny, because personal opinions are not set in stone. I may end up changing my mind about what I think of the series tomorrow, in six months, a year, it could be the moment I submit this review. Call me weak-willed, uneducated, easily manipulated, a sheep, what-have-you, but I am very open\n          \n        to anything and everything about Neon Genesis Evangelion to the point I really don't have any set opinions of my own. I'm not proud of it, yet I don't mind it. I find no joy in writing down my convoluted, hesitant thoughts on the show, yet I think it's fun to join in on the discussion. I know of the danger, yet I don't dread it.\nAnd I'm okay with that.\nThis is what Evangelion has done to me, personally, after years of exposure to an anime I had never seen and yet was spoon fed by numerous people about it. Everything from the fan-base to the hate-base is fascinating to me, and I think it's amazing a 20-year-old anime still sparks up discussion and debate in all corners of the world and World Wide Web.\nSTORY: In 2000, a catalyst called the Second Impact occurred in Antarctica, and the Earth's ecosystem is altered, such as the risen sea levels and seasons becoming nearly non-existent. Fifteen years later, the threat of a Third Impact looms over the heads of humanity. To prevent (or delay, or alter) their inevitable end, an organization called NERV is formed in Tokyo-3 to partake in the Evangelion project, using chosen fourteen-year-olds to pilot mechas to fight against entities known as the Angels. At the same time, NERV and another, SEELE, have plans for the human race they're keeping a secret, and their pawns are the EVA pilots, who are unaware of the true nature behind the Angel attacks, and their EVAs. \nPlus teen angst. Lots of it.\nIt's rather bare bones, but the story is there. Post-apocalyptic stories are rather hit-or-miss, having to rely on its execution to leave much of an impact. Evangelion's story is really not the best in the world, it's not even the worst, but it comes off as experimental. What started off as a formulaic monster-of-the-week, hero-saves-the-day show steadily delves into psychological territory with its characters before plummeting head-first into a pit of angst and despair, where it then remains even when it tries to crawl out of it enough times to bloody its fingers. And you are the note-taking observer behind the glass watching it all unfold while occasionally looking back through the tapes to see it happen all over again from a different angle.\nI'm not going to pretend I understood everything that went on. Clearly, there was something there, but it's hidden under all the copious amount of (faux) symbolism involving religion, the psyche, subliminally-placed mindfuckery, and sexually-suggestive images that clutter the show well into the movies. And for all I know, it was all a red herring, a misunderstanding. But even red herrings can play important roles in a story when used correctly. So should everything be dismissed just because it looks “cool”, or “interesting”, or because “the director wanted to mess with us”?\nDepends on what you want the show to be about, I suppose. I'd understand if they wrote NGE by the seat of their pants, but that's very impressive if it's true. And if everything was thrown together for the sake of looking “cool”, or “different”, it was weaved very well into the show to the point I think it'd be an entirely different show if it was all taken out. The story would remain the same, but then we wouldn't be here talking about the show, now would we?\nCHARACTERS: This is pretty much the heart of the series, which overtook the plot very quickly. Apparently, according to a 1996 interview, the characters are based off Hideaki Anno's own personality traits, particularly psychologically broken (as someone who writes, I frankly don't blame him for this, although it's interesting more than one would be based after part of himself). This comes off as a character study than character-driven, which isn't entirely a bad thing. But even then, we don't really get down and dirty into their minds until the second half, or even late into the second half, so we only are exposed to the surface until then while watching them do their thing in their own little world. Even so, the characters don't really grow like one would expect characters to do. They come into the anime broken, and they leave even worse, sometimes losing their minds in the process. Every character can be looked at and analyzed, but that'll take all day, it'll make the review way too long for any of you to care, and it'll also go into spoiler territory, so we're not going to do that. (I learned it's best to discuss this one-on-one with others due to different interpretations on what the characters stand for and why they act the way they do. Also, there's more thinking room allowing for cool downs should it ever come to that.)\nThe three main characters we follow are Shinji Ikari, Asuka Langley Soryu, and Rei Ayanami, the fourteen-year-old EVA pilots, with adults Misato Katsuragi, Ritsuko Akagi, and Gendo Ikari running the operation. There are others, but their roles in the story vary in terms of importance, and we don't get to observe their thought-processes as often as the six I just listed. That doesn't mean they can be written out of the story altogether, but they don't necessarily drive the plot forward unless needed. Still, they all are interlinked with the main characters in some way or another, so surgically removing them would mean changing the characters, whether for the better or the worse. It's hard to say without really delving into it, and even then, there's no right or wrong answer.\nRegardless, because the characters don't grow out of their archetypes, your mileage will vary on whether-or-not you liked them, or were at least able to tolerate them. I should also tell you it's okay to get frustrated with them for any and all reasons you may have. And trust me, unless you have the patience of a saint or have watched the series enough times to get “used” to it, something will get under your skin concerning the characters. As it should.\nART/ANIMATION: As a graduate film student, watching Evangelion is like watching a cinematic lesson. The uses of lighting, camera angles, and framing is very fascinating—dare-I-say hypnotic—to me, and in a way, it gives off an experimental feel while still being basic, artsy while being bare bones. It's proof that effective cinematography can be done without fancy camerawork, or big budgets (although those do help) while also being a prime example on what happens when you make poor monetary decisions and managements. \nThe animation itself is rather limited at times, which is why the cinematography was important. But when it got moving, it looks impressive even to this day. Gainax I feel has a rather distinctive touch when it comes to their animation, and Evangelion I think was what cemented that touch for future projects. There's clearly a passion there, and even with all the goof-ups and slight changes in art style, I can't help but fall head-over-heels for the animation of the EVAs and Angels and how iconic the designs are. Now some people do say the art looks ugly even for 90s standards, but I don't see how that's bad. It helps distinguish itself from other anime of the time, and if it indeed looks as “ugly” as claimed, then perhaps it was intentional as things indeed get ugly throughout the series in thematic terms. It's clearly not a happy, beautiful setting (although it has a charm to it), so why not go all the way?\nEpisodes 25 and 26, however, are particularly infamous in this category. It comes off as artsy-fartsy, but it also comes off as sloppy and lazy with the reused stock footage/cels spliced in between still images of sometimes-less detailed portraits. Likewise with the entire show, this all depends on who you ask. I personally love how it looks because the combination of all the above come into play here as we delve into the disturbed psyches of the characters, and the theater element used is an interesting touch.\nSOUND: “Cruel Angel's Thesis”, composed and created by Neko Oikawa, Hidetoshi Sato, and Toshiyuki Omori, as performed by Yoko Takahashi is one of the most well-known anime opening themes in otaku-dom, and is one of my personal favorites. The opening itself is something I feel is perfect in terms of visuals and matching the lyrics. Kazuya Tsurumaki directed it with main animation done by Tekeshi Honda and Shinya Hasegawa, and they have my respect. Oh, it's spoilerific, but it's beautifully subliminally-placed during the chorus that it's mesmerizing, and multiple viewings have only gotten me to further appreciate it. The ending song, “Fly Me to the Moon”, doesn't sound like it fits at first, but as the series continues and the lyrics sink in, it has more meaning to the characters than first believed. But that's not what people take away from it, no. It's the many versions that were recorded and sung by a few of the Japanese voice actresses (with Megumi Hayashibara having the most) and other singers, although Claire's vocals are first used.\nThe music as composed by Shirou Sagisu has such a wide range that one would have to be hard-pressed to find a score that was bad or ill-fitting. It can go from jazzy and upbeat, to a battle theme that gets the blood pumping, to eerie atmospheric music that leaves impressions on your mind. “Decisive Battle”, “Rei I-though-III”, “Angel Attack”, and “Do You Love Me” come to my mind on the spot when thinking of the soundtrack, but it's safe to say all of the music used in Evangelion was pretty much done to great effect. And that includes the public domain music such as Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” and the Hallelujah chorus from Händel's “Messiah”.\nFrom what I've read, the Japanese cast is fantastic, so I'll have to take their word for it. I chose to watch the series dubbed because I felt I'd understand it better (I don't know if the mathematical and scientific mumbo-jumbo is bullshit or made sense with what was going on, so you tell me), but also because it came off to me as the iconic ADV Films dub. No, the dub's not the best, but I don't think it's all that bad. The roles of the three children portrayed by Spike Spencer, Amanda Winn-Lee and Tiffany Grant are perhaps their most iconic roles, and I personally wanted to experience that, and I don't regret it. They did take their time to get comfortable and find their groove, and the script/line-reading is a bit cheesy at times, but it's clear there was care put into it. Whether it was a good dub for the time or not, anime fans took what they could get. Apparently it did get a redub, or at least for some of the director's cut episodes, but I don't know much about that, so I can't tell you if it's any better.\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: I can say that depression leaves an... interesting impact on how one views the world, but more specifically with oneself. I can believe Hideaki Anno's mental state may have influenced the structure of Evangelion, particularly psychologically. Whether this was really intended from the start or not I can't say, especially since everyone goes through life differently, and a mental illness such as depression has a varying effect on everyone who suffered or is currently suffering from it. I don't judge the show based on it, however, even though it's an interesting, albeit sometimes hard watch with that on the mind.\nI sometimes wonder what I would think about it today if I had seen it as a teenager. At times, I have enjoyed the series, and other times I didn't. This also tends to vary, as something I may have previously liked is suddenly something I don't like. Thus, this is hard for me to pinpoint an exact score. But if we want to go with the first time I watched it, I was rather mesmerized by it, so... yeah. I enjoyed it. But with each rewatch I've so far done, I found it more fascinating than enjoyable, and I don't think that's a bad thing. \nThe reason I decided to watch Evangelion is because of how ubiquitous it is to the anime fandom. I unfortunately knew of the plot twists, but there were still a lot I never knew about that I was pleased to see. It took a bit, but I was eventually able to see how influential the series is, and found an appreciation for it.\nWhich is why I gave the series a 10. It's not perfect, there's flaws up the wazoo and all that symbolic imagery could've been taken out and the plot wouldn't have suffered less from it (maybe), as well as not give off a sense of being pretentious. Yet in doing so, it loses a sense of identity. The characters are not always going to resonate soundly with everyone for any reason, but to change them would've meant changing everything. The ending(s) does come off as a big middle finger to the viewer, but only if they wish to think that way (whether it was the true intentions of the director or not). But it's a 10, a “masterpiece” as it's labeled on the rating system, because of the impact it left on anime, on (Japanese) pop culture, but most importantly, on its viewers who still find things to talk about even though it's beating a dead horse most of the time.\nThis is the epitome of a classic. Classics don't necessarily mean “perfect”, “the good/blessing of mankind”. A classic leaves behind a legacy to last a lifetime or two. It's fated to be immortalized by those who wish to remember it in whatever form they want. Neon Genesis Evangelion, “Gospel of a New Generation/Genesis”, “New Beginning Gospel”, however you want to interpret its title, has earned its place amongst the classics of animation regardless of how many people have seen it, and have praised or apprehended it.\nAnd you can debate that to hell and back all you want. It's still not going to change anything.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion is a polarizing anime for many people, myself included. The show includes both some of the best material the mecha genre has to offer as well as some of the most frustrating. The franchise has taken on a life of its own and it is one of the most popular anime has ever seen. I think to properly assess the show, one has to take into consideration whether it lives up to the hype and popularity.\nFirst, the good. Evangelion is not a dull or lifeless cliché as many shows in the mecha genre can be. Taking heavy inspiration from Yoshiyuki Tomino, director\n          \n        Hideaki Anno treats much of the show as a deconstruction of the mecha genre. For example the main character, Shinji Ikari, is not a gung ho mecha pilot, but similar to Tomino's Amuro Ray is considerably burdened by the role others expect of him and often pushes back against it. While this is just one example, the show includes many other deconstructions as well. At times the animation itself is often shaky, but the design work of the show is quite strong. The Evangelions (the main mecha of the show) and the Angels that they fight in particular have some very interesting and unique designs to them.  You can tell a lot of thought went into making the Angels special. While it has no actual meaning to the plot, the intermingling of Christian symbolism into the show gives the show an interesting mystique. While the music is not on the level of one done by say Yoko Kanno, it is still a very strong soundtrack. And there are several parts of the show where both the plot and the overall direction are incredibly strong and provide us some really high quality work.\nNow, for the bad. \n-The characters in this show are, with rare exception either really unlikable, or hard to have much sympathy for. Misato Katsuragi, the immediate supervisor of the show's 3 main pilots is very likable. But other than her, you have to delve into the show's more minor characters to find a likable one. The main character in Shinji is often portrayed as too weak willed and a pushover. Asuka, one of his fellow Evangelion pilots is arrogant, selfish and greedy to the point of absurdity; even when her tragic past was revealed I still disliked the character immensely. The third Evangelion pilot, Rei Ayanami is one of the most popular anime characters of all time. But the character does nothing to deserve such praise. The character has no personality to speak of. Her popularity rose out of the mystique of the character and the fact that her lifeless doll-like nature made her very attractive to repressed male viewers. Other characters like Shinji's father Gendou or scientist Ritsuko also are very unlikable characters.\n-The show's pacing for the first half of the series is quite slow. While I wouldn't go as far as calling them filler episodes (as the episodes do at least contain some character development), the show would have been better served if they consolidated several episodes in the first half of the series so as to permit more space in the second half. \n-Once we hit episode 21, the show's quality takes a sudden nosedive, caused in part due to the poor pacing in the first half. We receive an episode that fills in a lot of the show's backstory, but is narratively quite jarring considering the mysterious nature of the show to this point and the slowness in which information had been handed out to this point. A couple of episodes later a tragic event occurs impacting multiple characters for which the show has been building up to the entire series. However a subsequent scene in the same episode immediately wipes out all of the impact of said tragic event. There is also a new character introduced whose relationship with Shinji is shown to be as possibly as important as any relationship he's ever had, but there is only half an episode to develop said relationship  making everything come off as extremely rushed. There are multiple instances in the last 6 episodes where we are treated to a scene where the animation completely pauses for a minute or more. Hardcore fans of the show will point to such decision being genius, but I see these for what they truly are; the show’s producers cheapening out and depriving us of a minute or more of real material due to either their laziness or improperly handling their budget and deadlines.\n-No discussion of Evangelion would be complete without mentioning the show's ending, where approximately 90% of the storyline is suddenly rendered meaningless. Numerous things that we have been building up to throughout the entire show are suddenly swept away as if they never made any difference. You are left with an ending that resolves one major storyline but makes you feel like you have completely wasted your time watching the previous 24 episodes for the others. And even said resolution I find quite contradictory to much of the series to that point. Defenders will claim that the show had outside pressures that led to the ending being done in this fashion, such as budget and censorship pressures. But I would argue that it was the director's responsibility to properly manage the show throughout the entire series and he clearly failed on multiple fronts by putting himself in such a position for the ending of the show. On the brightside, one can watch the movie End of Evangelion and get proper resolution to things that the TV ending swept aside as if they were meaningless. But that's another review.\nFinally, I'll say that the show has a hype and fandom that it simply does not deserve. This is a show that is proclaimed the best mecha anime of all time, the most original anime of all time, but it deserves neither of those titles. Part of me thinks it is unfair to hold this show to a higher standard when assessing it on its merits. But the fact remains that when the show's fans and the general media proclaim that the show reached a height that never had been and has never since been reached, and that every mecha anime show after it is a low quality rip-off, you need to assess whether the show truly qualifies for such matters. And the simple fact is it doesn't. The show is surpassed overall by other shows which have tighter plots, more likable characters and an overall higher production quality. And the show is nowhere as original as its fans or the general public would led you be believe. One with knowledge of older Sunrise mecha anime, particularly ones directed by Tomino and Anno's previous works will find huge amounts of inspiration for this series.\nOverall is this show worth seeing? Definitely. I feel that much of this review has been a bit harsh on the show, but it genuinely is a good one and if you are a fan of the mecha genre, it is a must see. But no, it is not the greatest or most original mecha anime of all time as many have proclaimed it to be."},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=18,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    As there is a lot of discussion about this issue, in my opinion Neon Genesis Evangelion deserves to be seen as one of the most important anime series. Why is that?\nFor me, the answer would be: the characters and the overall experience that is NGE.\nIn this review I will give the reasons why I really liked this series and give the reader an idea why he or she should watch it, too.\nWhile the story seems pretty simple and cliched at first it soon gains depth and scale and you realize it's about much more than you thought. Giving away anything would really spoil the experience\n          \n        so let me just tell you that the writing is superb and it adresses very important themes in an impressive way. You might learn a lot about yourself and your feelings by watching NGE.\nThe great writing helps breathing live into the characters and making them very reliable. Also, the story spends a lot of time exploring their backgrounds, experiences and feelings, thereby giving reasons for their actions. Though it might not seem like it if you watch just one episode - the characters are as far away from being a one-dimensional chliché as one can image. That's something not many animes achieve. Sometimes you'll be happy, sometimes you'll be sad but you'll always feel strongly for the characters.\nAlso, the story always stays exciting and surprising which of course adds to the overall enjoyment. The ending left me slightly puzzled - while I sort of understood what was going on and liked the conclusion it still felt like some important parts were left out. I expect the follow-up movie, The End of Evangelion to sort this out.\nWhile the art is obviously from the 90s it's still so much better than a lot of what you see today. It's hard to describe but everything feels organic, the characters feel like real people and the surroundings seem to be places that could actually exist. I would even go as far as to compare it with immersion you get when you read a great novel and create the world in your head. This is even more impressing as some art is very reduced working with only the outlines or shadows and there are many still pictures. As far as I know that was due to financial reasons. I didn't mind though and it feels like some of the money they saved there went into the animation of the fights which are exciting and vibrant. The art also does a great job of picturing the inside of a characters head when their feelings are explored, you'll know what I mean when watching it.\nThe sound completes the work of art that NGE is. The opening is great, catchy and fits the series well. The music by Sagisu Shirou is just perfect, sporting memorable themes and raising the tension in exciting moments while also setting the right mood during quieter moments.\nI hope this helps understand why I enjoyed NGE so much and I hope you'll watch it and feel the same way!\n        "},
		{["score"]=2,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    What do you get when you have terrible characters, adhering to a terrible plot, with an equally terrible premise, in a high school setting, having a humongous (and I mean behemoth) fan base, with the only redeeming feature of an amazing soundtrack? You get this show: Neon Genesis Evangelion. \nPutting aside any philosophical stances you have about this show for a moment, lets just look at this h*ll hole of a story. Shinji is our main protagonist, our lovable and relatable hero that has an active and dynamic personality that every good protagonist is supposed to have. Wait, no he isn't. Not even remotely close.\n          \n        Every great protagonist needs a couple things:\nNobody likes a passive character. Those that wait to be acted upon don't have a strong enough character to have motive. They have no driving force in their life, so there is really no point in that character. Maybe there are some people out there that enjoy the whole \"I'm a useless human being that has no redeeming features except being normal but a little bit on the angsty side but for some reason I REALLY good at video games or killing monsters or fighting in giant robots or (enter stupid overpowered trait here) regardless of my complete lack of experience and I make tons of girls wet by doing so, oh and by the way I'm also the only boy that can do magic of pilot this mecha so I have to go to an all girls school. Don't worry though, because I'm pretty d*mn dense and I rarely make any moves on any of the women that have such horrible taste and so desperately want the contents of my pants\" trope. \nSince the beginning of time, the most interesting characters have been active. Sherlock Holmes, Odysseus, Dr. Jekyll, David Copperfield, Captain Ahab, Hamlet, Tom Sawyer etc. These are all people that are motivated to solve their problems that they face, no matter the size. From one extreme, Odysseus trying to survive many trials on his path home and Dr. Jekyll fighting the clock to find the cure to keep himself sane, to the other end with Tom Sawyer trying to stave off boredom and David Copperfield just trying to have a happy and successful life.\nEvangelion is not the worst anime at this one as there is some development of character throughout the series, but not really. The character that is the most dynamic gets tons of admiration and love for smiling at the protagonist. I didn't know that having a terrible personality warrants love whenever you show emotions. The development is mostly at a superficial level and the characters seem to be stuck in a loop of never getting over themselves.\nEverybody in every story needs something that makes them stand out as an actual being, or a individual. They don't have to have ultramarine hair either. They just need a simple trait, physical or personality that makes them them. Why do you think harem or, even more so, reverse harem characters all have different color or style hair? This is because they have no personalities. Being hot is not a personality. Sorry to break it to all the fanboys and fangirls out there. I'm not saying that this is the case for every series, like the reverse-harem OHSHC has very clear distinctions between all the characters (of course, only if you count the twins as one character), and the characters in the harem anime The World God Only Knows are all so individualized and developed, it's the entire point of the show. While one is more comedic and the other is more character-driven, many people of both genders find both to be amazing stories. This is definitely not because either have a great plot. In one a group of guys blackmail a girl to be a host and seduce girls to make their club money, and the other is a story about a loser that makes girls fall in love with him so he doesn't die. However, one of the greatest books in the history of literature is about a man that wants to hunt a whale.\nWould it kill people to make a character that you wouldn't mind sitting down for a cup of tea or coffee and just chat with? None, and I repeat NONE of the characters in this show are people that I would want to talk to if real. That point alone isn't a complete deal breaker, but the fact that I don't hate them either is. It is okay to hate characters. It is even okay to hate popular characters. The opposite is also true, it is perfectly fine to love unpopular characters. It is not fine, however, for there to be characters that create indifference. Those kinds of characters are best described in 4 words: \"a waste of space\". No purpose whatsoever.\nAlthough I mentioned above that plot isn't super important, lets just give a quick rundown on the amazing plot that this \"masterpiece\" has that could pass as the summary of a cheap porno. There is a boy with daddy issues, that mounts his mother to fight monsters with his lady friends. He is super angsty and complains about most everything in his life even when there is nobody there to talk to. He has many girls in his life that show romantic interest in him, including a clone of a clone of a clone of his mother, who most likely also pilots a clone of this mother as well. Another one is the definition of abusive. At least she wasn't as bad as Louise in Familiar of Zero. Without spoiling too much. The ending will make you wonder if you are taking acid. I don't believe that the creators even knew what was happening when they made the ending movie.\nMany people may say that you aren't a true anime fan if you haven't seen this one, but my recommendation is to sit this one out.\n        "},

Out of my 15+ years of watching various anime, this is legitimately still a 10/10, and it's not even because of the amount of poor reviews.   IMO it is truely deserving of this score.  There are countless amounts of anime that pale in comparison just in terms of world building, dramatic themes, atmosphere, and animated fight scenes, etc..  Literally, there were moments where my heart stirred just from the magnitude of situations within the show mixed in with a simply stellar OST.  It\n          \n        was and still is entertaining as hell, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching every bit of this show.   \nNow It's fine if you don't like the show, it's not your taste, you hate shinji & asuka, etc. etc. you have several gripes with it.  Hell, that's what makes everyone unique and different.  But 1/10s? Seriously?  People who rate like that are only biased kids or fans of their own ego who don't appreciate anime from an artistic & production standpoint.  Remember, this was 1995 people, and the show's quality was simply superb, especially for the 90s.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, that is simply the truth. \nWhat I love about NGE is that the show does its best to portray what is going on within the world in a somewhat believable and realistic fashion, despite the premise of the show being nonsensical.  The show actually does a fantastic job of portraying what living in this world would feel like, and how damn crazy the world would be like if the brink of world destruction was constantly imminent.\nI mean you can hate Shinji or Asuka or whomever all you want, but you can't deny that there are all different kinds of people in this world that exist.  If you can understand that, then honestly these characters will not bother you in the least because the show stays true to their character portrayals, and really that's all you can ask for in any anime.  You just want the characters to act like they are portrayed, and IMO this is very well done throughout this show.\nI wasn't going to even write a review for this show but I did it for myself.  Why? simply for my own sense of justice and peace of mind.  Like how sad that people can't appreciate this show.  It's like I could just feel the sincerity that was put into this show, trying to make it the best it possibly could be at the time, trying to provide quality entertainment and drama.

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion follows the story of Shinji Ikari as he is forced into humanity’s struggle against beings known as Angels. \nEva is commonly referred to as a deconstruction as it counters and plays with popular clichés and tropes within the mecha genre. The major difference is that the robots and battles take a back seat in the series. That’s not to say that there isn’t a good amount of robot porn (Gainax still has to sell figures right?) but it certainly isn’t the main focus. The mechs themselves are also fairly unique, being slim in profile and having intricate details such as the power\n          \n        source being a giant battery that can run out. This contrasts heavily with typical mecha anime which have bulky robots that run on a seemingly magical power source. Even the setting is far removed from the grand space opera set pieces one would expect. There are a handful of other subtle things that go against the grain of traditional mecha and it makes for an interesting twist that works pretty well. \nBriefly touching on the religious symbolism in Eva that has been a point of controversy- Champions of the series claim that this symbolism holds a deeper meaning while detractors claim it is a pretentious ploy. I’ve always felt that it works aesthetically as a nice backdrop and nothing more. Either way, it doesn’t take away from the other aspects of the series so it is peculiar to see both sides making such a big fuss about it. Of course, it does not help when the creator who is known for getting rises out of the fans stirs the pot by saying the symbolism means nothing.\nBy in large the main draw (or source of contention for some people) of Neon Genesis Evangelion is the characters and their psychological drama that surrounds them as well as their interactions with other characters. There is something unique and oddly absorbing about the way Eva explores its characters and their troubles. Through subtle (and not so subtle) actions you get a great amount of insight into every character. This can range from a small conversation to an entire episode that revolves around a character's internal struggle played out through internal dialogue. This all lends to the depressing, dark, and almost hopeless atmosphere persistent throughout the series. It is because of this that I feel people are attracted to how the series explores the characters rather than the character themselves.\nIt would be hard to claim the characters in Eva are likable, though a character doesn’t necessarily have to be likable to be well written it generally helps. That being said every character in the series can come off in one of two ways- \nA. Multifaceted and sympathetic individual with the subtleties of a real flesh and blood person.\nB. Walking mental disorder going around in the same repetitive circle that far exceeds suspension of disbelief.\nFor every telling and subtle action a character may do, there is an episode dedicated to a character debating the same singular issue in their head for twenty-four minutes. What’s even worse is that there is very little development with most characters as they choose to stay in their miserable and sad stasis. In an ironic and almost fittingly paradoxical manner, the characters end up being a pro and con in the series.    \nThere are a few other grievances that I had with Eva as a whole, most notably the lack of a budget leading to a stunted and bizarre ending. It’s an odd feeling, because I don’t necessarily dislike the ending and its outcome just the obscure, abrupt, and obviously financially strapped lead up. To add to the confusion there are two movies, Death and Rebirth and End of Evangelion that try to rectify the ending with Death and Rebirth being a recap of the first twenty-four episodes with additional scenes and End of Evangelion being an alternative ending(?) that takes place directly after episode twenty-four. This is what happens when creator of a series is a depressed asshole that likes to grief fans. Other issues are ironically ones shared by many anime in the same genre such as fourteen year old kids being the only ones who can pilot the robots for no other reason than figure sales.       \nAesthetically, Neon Genesis Evangelion shows its age and definitely has a 90's feel to it. That’s not to say it’s bad, but it hasn’t held up nearly as well as some other series from around the same time. If merchandise sales is any indicator the character design Eva is good, with Rei and Asuka being more or less a license to print money. The thought and care put into the music of Eva can only be rivaled by Cowboy Bebop which is to say it's pretty damn good. I really don't think there is track I dislike on Eva's OST and it easily one of my favorites of all time. \nI like Neon Genesis Evangelion and have a lot of respect for the series. It challenged and pushed the genre and medium in ways not many anime have been able to do. Eva is rich with neat subtleties and the impressive attention to detail really rewards the attentive, but for all of its more artsy elements there is still cute girls and robots at Eva's core. That being said, I’m not about to start claiming it's the pinnacle of storytelling like the fandom is known to do. The best way I’ve ever heard Eva described is as a flawed gem. The more I think about it the truer that statement becomes, because Eva really is brilliant in most areas and unpolished in only a few others. Neon Genesis Evangelion and its characters definitely stand out as interesting and unique, and flawed as it may be, Neon Genesis Evangelion will always be a highly entertaining classic that is adored by fans.

No other animated series can say it's brought forth as much controversy as this has. 23 years later it's still argued about, and still manages to maintain a passionate and loyal fanbase. Even with the rebuilds busy destroying the name, it consistently stands tall among the greatest series of all time, facing the relentless question over and over of whether it belongs in the hall of fame or whether it's wrapped up in just enough bullshit to get by. \nI'll start with the basics. NGE is NOT a series for everyone. Just as some prefer dogs\n          \n        to cats, and some prefer apples to oranges, others prefer various types of shows to this. Also, NGE is NOT a mecha show. If you are looking for a heroic mecha in which the main character overcomes all obstacles and wins a good amount of the time watch Gurren Lagann, which I can respectfully say is a masterpiece in it's own way, one that really doesn't suit my tastes though. \nEvangelion is a psychological thriller, with a mix of philosophical themes that question humanity, love, who we are, our existence, and many other themes. It is NOT a series you can shut your brain off while watching, or skip a few episodes and still understand, hell it isn't even a series you can understand the first time watching. It is meant to be this way. It's meant to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat, questioning everything, developing theories, and slowly beginning to see the incredible level of detailing and thematic expression that Anno places into it. 23 years later people are still finding new details in Evangelion that weren't seen before, showcasing just how creatively complex this series is. If you can understand this, and keep your mind open while viewing the series, it'll be the greatest anime, scratch that artistic experience of your life. \nEvangelion's story might be off putting at first. Teenage boy has to pilot mecha to save the world? Where have I heard this before? This is a spoiler free review but I can tell you right away the moment you get in it becomes anything but that. From the moment the first episode starts it's already weaving threads into a blanket of plot, and parts of the first episode are already show the animators know where the plot is going and what they are doing, contrary to what some may say. From then outwards, it grows increasingly complex, as more mysteries, more technicalities and more difficulties are added. Due to Anno's incredible directorship there never is a dull moment in the show, as each individual Angel is incredibly creative and the fights even more so. Whether you end up liking it or not by the end of the show, you'll have to admit that no series could ever cram as much content into 26 episodes as Evangelion can. To put it simply, it's a ride from start to finish. \nNeon Genesis Evangelion and EoE for that matter are rightfully considered flawed masterpieces. The art was good for it's time, but is still a far cry from fantastic, and the amount of budget constraints that went into the show are easily seen.\nI always talked about how it would have been better to just \"Redraw\" Evangelion. No rebuilds, no new characters, just entirely redrawn in 2018 standards. The only reason I would prefer this is because it would draw in new fans, fans that wouldn't have their first taste of the series be the god awful rebuilds. However, if that's done, some of the aesthetics are already lost. The fact that the art style is constrained, the fact that it holds frames and cuts corners, and the fact that the sinking budget is so visible are a critical part of Evangelion itself. Evangelion is a masterful series that is portrayed as a human work. The flaws and hiccups show that it was created by human people, people with dreams, emotions, lives. If you turn it into a CGI mess, then it's already an entirely different series. For that reason, I believe the art accomplishes it's goal.\nI don't risk sounding like too much of a fanboy (Although by this point it likely doesn't matter) when I say Evangelion's soundtrack is a masterpiece in it's own. The iconic \"Cruel Angel's Thesis\" and the cover of \"Fly me to the moon\" were great on their own, but the individual pieces in Evangelion are what make it stand out. Comparible, but by no means similar to Cowboy Bebop, Eva's often uses it's soundtrack to really strike the mood right. The individual pieces of the OST convey certain emotions incredibly well, for instance \"Decisive Battle\" manages to output a sense of urgency and anxiety alongside a battle theme, a perfect partner to the characters and their minds themselves. Much like the music of Star Wars, you can tell exactly the emotions of a scene simply by hearing a few notes and recognizing the theme. It's a model soundtrack that other anime's should (And do for that matter) follow. \nAll of the above might seem like the perfect components to make a masterpiece, and in some ways they are. But it's the characters that transform Evangelion into Evangelion. The cast of NGE are without a doubt the most human characters you may ever see, and oftentimes they are hated precisely for that reason. When some people watch anime, they are looking to escape, to pretend to be someone they aren't. They want to be a person who overcomes their obstacles and fights vigilantly to become the greatest at what they can do. What they don't want, and what Evangelion provides, is a reality slap to the face as they stare directly at themselves. Even Anno himself stated that he hates the parts of Evangelion's characters where he sees himself, but that by no means makes them bad. The fact that you can see yourself in these characters, the fact that it manages to portray your struggles, your fears, your dreams in true human form on screen is a magical and unforgettable experience. The theme of Evangelion is learning to love yourself. I can only feel pity for those who hate the series because they hate themselves. \nThe last bit I can really say about the series is that it isn't a dry textbook of philosophical and psychological themes. Even if you don't give a rats ass about those 2 subjects, you'll still find it an incredibly enjoyable experience. Anno's mastery as a director cannot be overstated, and even removing the core of Evangelion the individual fights are quite entertaining to view. When I first watched Evangelion, I stayed up all night to watch all 26 episodes, simply due to how mesmerizing and enjoyable it was, something no other series has ever managed to do. NGE is a staple all anime fans must see at some point in their life, so even if you absolutely despise psychological anime you won't be disappointed. \nNo other show has changed my life like Evangelion has. Even on shitty days when I want nothing more than to throw myself off a bridge, Evangelion is there, a gentle reminder that there is reason to exist, that some form of happiness can be found on this world, that no matter how shitty things get you can still live. “Anywhere can be paradise as long as you have the will to live. After all, you are alive, so you will always have the chance to be happy. As long as the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth exist, everything will be all right.” Thank you all for reading, and Congratulations!\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    i wrote a review about NGE before but i felt like it was a bit hypocrite and  didn't reflect my feelings and thoughts twards the show.\nmy first encounter with NGE was while watching a video on youtube and what i saw was  a gaint robot  tearing another robot apart savagely and splitting its blood(isn't that cool a robot that can bleed) all over the place ,on the streets and on the buildings it was a disturbing and scary scene that made me curious about this show and what it was all about,so i went to evangelion with high expectations especially after i\n          \n        knew that it is one of the most successful anime franchise and among the most influential in the medium but it was a big disappointment to me.\nthe story is about teenagers piloting giant robots to save the world in a post appocalyptic settings,throw to this mix some random religious symbolism and a lots of psychological and philosophical babbling that make little to no sense along with very violent and disturbing sequences and of course a good amount of fan service,this was the magnum opus that used by director hideaki anno and it proved to be successfull since it followed by dozen of shows that combine giant robot elements with religion and mysticism ,it was just different so people deemed it to be great and cool,but while watching the show i felt like it was trying so hard to be deep and philosophical ,i found it to be pretentious and bizarre and couldn't take it seriously.\nthe story at first follow a generic monster of the week formula it helps to introduce you to the characters and the settings then it slows down in the middle then takes a dark turn towards the end,the show has many plotholes for example why did they build the headquarter of NERV(the organisation that lead the fight against the alien) under the largest metropolian area on the planet  eventhough they knew it contains something that would attract the angels?why  did they call those aliens the angels?from where they come?what interest me the most and keep me watching was the EVA units their origin and what they have to do with the aliens,the concept behind using those giant robots and why they only piloted by 15 years old teenagers albeit convoluted but at least they try to give a reason.\nthere is a lot of pseudo-scientific babbling that went in the operation room of NERV during each battle it was too hard to follow it.\n i have to admit i don't like psychological shows and i don't like teenager protagonists this is why i don't like EVA characters ,since the main trio are angsty driven teenagers,rei has no personality ,no emotions she is basically a doll couldn't they develop her character more and flesh it out ,asuka is an annoying bitch she could have been a great character if they had reduced her tsundere side a bit,and shinji is the biggest emo loser i've ever seen,they try to add depth to these characters by giving them tragic backstories and parental issues but that wasn't enough to make me care for them, the characterization was plain awful many characters spend most of the show angsting and when they didn't going FULL EMO MODE they were yelling at each other,if you want to create flawed characters try to give them a certain amount of likability so we could care for them ,my biggest problem with shinji character is that he's got almost all the attention in the show basically the whole show revolves around him but taking into account the inherent annoying nature of his character, it was too painful to watch him and i don't like his development since he always return to the same point he began from it,his presence feels too forced in the show ,there is so much emphasis on him, each time he is about to die the deux ex machina of his eva come out of nowhere to save his ass,i'd prefer if his character take a back seat for another protagonist while continuing to descend in his depression.\nshinji psychological problem and inner struggle minimized when you take into account the situation of humanity in the series,what i mean is that when an angel attack you will forget every thing about shinji and demand him to get his head out of his ass and to do his job.\n\nSPOILER \nit would have been better if he got depressed after what happened with toji , refuses to pilot his eva again and maybe commit siucide to end his misery\n\nEND OF THE SPOILER\nfor me the adult characters in the show where more interesting than shinji ,i wish if they had more screen time .\nEVA  is considered very influential because of its the charcters although i hate that influence since it popularized beta male characters,tsundere and kuudere(whatever shit they call them),many eva fans praise eva and hate anime today even though their favourite show could be blamed for some archetypes they hate so much and call it a plague that must be exterminated ,they hate wimpy spinless male characters yet they consider the shinji as the best anime character,this is  what i call hypocricy.\nas for the religious symbolism it has nothing to do with the story ,just random biblical names for the sake of it,don't try to dig deep into it only pretentious overthinkers would do that,if you're looking for deep and meaningful religious symbolism go watch movies like\" there will be blood\" or \"the matrix\".\nthe character design is attractive and appealing,the design of the robot is iconic and demonic,unfortunately the animation is bad , it only became good during battle sequences and the las two episodes couldn't even considered a motion picture.\nthe opening theme is memorable but the use of classical music was just hilarious.\n\nin the end each one has an opinion and this was my opinion about NGE i found it to be highly overrated and silly,before evangelion anime was edgy after evangelion anime remain edgy but became pretentious as well."},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="                          \n    In the rating system, for me, this jumped from 4  to 3, to 5, to 1, back to 3, then plummeted to 1 at the end and never recovered. I appreciate anime's style and substance, and this series had both, sometimes enough of both to justify it's classic status. Fabulously scary, those Angels are. And what a back story--half the Earth's population killed in the second impact--that's the stuff of epics. Some of the battle sequences are breathtaking. Yet for all this, we've got the most whiny, annoying and unlikable wuss for a \"hero\". Shinji, shut up. Daddy doesn't love you? I don't blame\n          \n        him, you scrawny little creep. Take this plus an anticlimactic, largely incomprehensible finale (to me, anyway, kudos to anyone who could understand it), the deterioration of the primarily jovial, lively co-stars into moping basket-cases, and the oh-never-mind disposal of the last Angel. What a let-down. \"Congratulations,\" they yammer at the end. Well, thanks. I guess that's for making it through those last three episodes. This one's all over the map, and while it's got qualities to recommend it, it's got others that'll make you gnash your teeth in frustration.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    First things first, if you think that you won't like NGE because it's mecha, then you are clearly mistaken. This anime goes beyond the simple recipe of robot action. It's an anime which consists of everything, thus it has action, romance, meanings, comedy, drama etc. However, that is not what makes NGE a good anime - it's my favourite one, but it's definitely not the best anime out there, so I will try not to act like a fanboy-  NGE is unique, because of the characters involved. The whole anime revolves around the mentality and the psychology of each different individual. And we are\n          \n        talking about 4 - mainly- characters, each one having a completely different way of thinking and percieving things. I won't bother explaining the story, which is also great, has quite some plot twists and even if you won't enjoy the 2 final episodes, it makes this anime worth watching. Because in the last 2 episodes, the judgement time comes. You will either love them, or - propably this one- you will hate them and discard this show as an overrated piece of art.\nAnd that's where I want to focus. The last 2 episodes, episodes 25 and 26. I won't spoil anything, and believe me there is nothing to be spoiled. These episodes made clear, what Hideaki Anno had in his mind while writing NGE. It's the epitome of this anime, even though many people say they just suck. I won't lie, when I first watched them, I hated this anime as well. I thought it was a total waste of time. And so do my friends that I have recommended this anime to. However, I took my time and re-watched the series. Nowadays I must have watched it 3 or 4 times. The last 2 episodes? About 10 times. \nIf you want to enjoy NGE, you must understand how to intercept it. And you must intercept it as a father, or maybe better, a God or an announcer. You will be the one to whom will be revealed every trait, every positive thing, every aspect of a personality. And you will judge them at the same time. That's what the final 2 episodes are all about. And you will learn a couple of things by paying attention to what Anno wanted to pass on to us, instead of being narrow minded and disliking it.\nIn my opinion, the series is the true NGE. End of Evangelion -which is a remake of the final 2 episodes to please the audience- was  a movie created by Anno to avoid being critisized by the public furthermore. And in case you didn't know, Hideaki Anno, the creator of this series, recieved a bombardment of angry letters about the last 2 episodes, including death threats. And that explains a lot of things in End of Evangelion.\nAll in all, NGE is a REAL anime, the world and the scenario are a masterpiece, full of plot twists and changes. There are some religious references included, however they only add up to the epicness of the series. You will either hate or love Evangelion, truth be told, it's an anime for people with odd tastes and an appetite for the unknown...\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion is a meticulous character study of Shinji Ikari, while at the same time managing to provide most of the other named characters with excellent development throughout the show. We get to know the characters through the relationships they form with each other, but also through the show inventively exploiting the mechanics of its world and even the main \"antagonists\".  \nFirstly, something that I really appreciate about Evangelion is that people don't talk in unusual ways just for the sake of exposition, and characters won't act in 'anime' ways.\n\nJust the directing and artwork seen in Evangelion could make it a show notorious by themselves, and with good reason: The show has very memorable designs and colour palettes, especially for the mecha stuff, which the people at GAINAX love. The scenes flow very smoothly from one to another and the camera angles and shot composition are always chosen to increase the emotion of a scene or give it more punch, for instance, in the scenes where you can hear a focus shine and a character suddenly appear (something typically used with Gendo). Even the long shots which people typically say were done to save budget are there on purpose, as evidenced by the long shots remaining even in the director’s cut versions of the episodes. They make you get into the characters’ place and think about their situation.\nAnother directing technique that I personally like is the one where the camera lingers on an object/character while we hear other people talk about something related to the object/character, it expands the world by showing us how acts that the characters do are also commented and thought about by people that we don’t necessarily know, while at the same time giving us insight into what a character might be thinking, or how the average person would see the situation that is happening (like how the doctors commented on Asuka’s mum’s situation).\n                                                   -----Spoilers-----\nOn the surface, Evangelion's plot follows a very simple monster of the week structure with little breaks from it. However, the multiple organizations seeking different profits from the attacks of the monsters (angels) is what makes the feud with the angels more interesting, as we see how each side is acting to benefit themselves while at the same time having to combat the oncoming force.\nFurthermore, throughout the show we are slowly given information about the underlying schemes of the organizations and eventually see those come into fruition as they happen, we are not told much of the plans, but we see them unfold, which is something I appreciate. Another thing I liked was how the main characters' backstories are the consequence of the plans still unfolding during the show: The main characters' mothers had to be put inside the Evas for them to move, which was what left them without proper parent figures, something that traumatized them and became the basis for most of their personality.\nThis will vary from person to person, however, I don't think that any of the characters actd 'whiny'. This is because the characters have understandable and defined motivations for every action they take, and since the motivations make sense and ar eunderstandable they don't come across as whiny. Especially since they're in the midst of what is esentially a war and they're 14 year-olds.\nShinji, for instance, has a low self-esteem, which stems from being abandoned as a kid and having perceived it as his fault. This eventually leads to him being abnormally afraid of being rejected (again) by others, preferring to run away from human interaction. Having low self-esteem, he also doesn’t try to make others respect what he wants, instead he simply ‘floats’ through life, doing what others tell him all the time. In fact, not showing us any of the time Shinji spent living with his teacher might have been intentional, as it makes us view that timespan as essentially nothing, which is likely how Shinji views it too. (Plus we got a bit of insight into Asuka’s life after being abandoned, unlike with Shinji).\nThrough becoming good at piloting the Eva and fighting the Angels, Shinji is showered with praise and develops some confidence, he even beats Asuka’s synch. score in episode 16. However, an angel easily defeats Shinji after he tried to act heroically, which totally shatters the cocky attitude Shinji was taking earlier in the episode, and shows that this self-esteem Shinji had earned through others’ praise was brittle and not really even self-esteem at all, as it wasn’t based upon confidence in himself.\nEven though I really like exploring Shinji and most of the main cast (the above is kind of an overview on Shinji), the best part of Evangelion to me is Shinji and Asuka’s relationship. It is so amazing seeing how they both have a shitty first impression of each other yet they later become friends and even develop some sexual tension (which is more relevant to Asuka’s character, since she sees sexual stuff as proving she is an adult). They’re friends, however, Shinji’s outward actions embody the type of person that Asuka sees as weak and she hates it. This makes Shinji beating her synch. ratio even more painful and starts her downward spiral since she doesn’t have an external validation to allow her to run away from her trauma. Since they keep living together, Asuka and Shinji are forced to interact and seeing those interactions in the midst of them being both troubled is great.\nHowever, their best interactions are in End of Evangelion,during instrumentality, where they finally communicate what they’re feeling to the other and react to the others’ actions, which culminates in Asuka stroking Shinji’s cheek and him breaking down at the end.\nTheir relationship is also very thematically relevant because it captures one of the themes that pervades the entire show: that of human intimacy and the fear towards it. Asuka and Shinji are sexually attracted to each other to an extent, yet the only bold advance is done on the premise that Asuka is bored so she wants to kiss. \nThis is because she is afraid of admitting she wanted to try to kiss with Shinji for any other reason, because of the fear of the pain that comes along with rejection.\nOverall, the characters don't really change much, however their personalities are very well defined, especially the main cast. What changes the most is characters' outlook on things. For instance, Shinji at the end of End of Evangelion hasn't chaged much or gotten over his trauma, but he has accepted himself more and is determined to try and overcome it. This being the central theme of End of Evangelion: \"As long as one is alive, anywhere can be paradise\". \n"},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=15,   ["text"]="                          \n    First and foremost, I would like to call for an end to the use of the phrase “mind f***” when describing this anime. I guess it is mostly attributed to the ending that was really just a mangled regurgitation of a few ideas from an introductory psychology course. “I am the me that exists in your mind”…give me a break. \nStory (6/10):\nMonsters called angels come from space to attack humanity. Their best bet is to use supernatural mecha called Eva that can only be piloted by teenagers to stop these attacks. The majority of the episodes fluctuate between fighting whatever random angel that comes that\n          \n        day and trying to live normal lives. Sound like an awful episodic structure that would fail in any poorly choreographed action series? You're right it is terrible. And worse, the stark contrast between these two states is painful. \nAs you have read or seen, there are hidden agendas and motives behind the characters and organizations in the series that get revealed little by little after each episode. This is one the few bright spots that this series has to offer and allowed me to retain interest in the series. Unfortunately, the end of the road is unrewarding to say the least. \nYou also may have read about religious references used in the show. None of these are relevant to the characters or story so they are really just trying to make the series seem more complicated than it really is. Don’t get bogged down trying to pay attention for them.\nCharacters(6/10):\nContrary to the beliefs of many, the main problem in this category is not that the characters are static. It comes down to interactions between the characters. I’d say that there is way too much explicit analysis of each character’s faults. Nearly all of the dialogue in this series outside of battle scenes involves either a character’s faults being criticized by themselves or another character. These criticisms make for some of the most melodramatic moments ever and I typically am a fan of melodrama (NANA and Geass ftw). \nThe characters were not static. Shinji, the main character, made changes to himself quite frequently and improved in some areas, but sheltered his main fault to the end. That is a route that isn’t seen often in this industry. Some characters got worse and worse matching the dark themes of the series . Others meant to be mysterious left us with more questions than answers…kudos. \nI think it is worth mentioning that the removal of Asuka from this series may improve the score of this series by 2 pts…just think about it. \nArtwork/Animation (7/10):\nThe dark and powerful vibe from the eva paired with slimed down armor schemes with vibrant colors makes for the best mecha designs I have seen.  The battle scenes however are extremely repetitive and lack general movement and choreography. For the most part, one eva pilot will try to attack the angel and will get immediately defeated. Then there will be a stupid sequence of scenes that ultimately exposes a lame weakness in the angel resulting in one of the pilots saving the day. All in the blink of an episode. Eva are apparently best suited for hand to hand combat, too bad they can’t animate this, so it rarely happens. Fortunately for us, the diverse camera shots that they use during these sequences are really cinematic, and a nice battle music selection amps the scenes up a bit as well. When the scene is set in the school or at home the artwork and animation was inconsistent and lazy.\nOverall Reaction:\nIf there were budget problems with this series why not halve the number of angels fought and not waste my time with lame fight sequences. Most of the time spent in the slice of life settings were used for poor comedic purposes and did not develop the characters. Why not halve that time as well. \nThis series is noteworthy for having some new psychological and mystery elements in a mecha series, but it is  paired with a boring repetitive vehicle of a plot that just manages to crawl to the end of the series. The ending is not a mind f*** moment...more of a f*** up moment that could have been handled much better had they spent maybe a little time on the script. The dialogue is bad, the music and art solid. The action sequences lackluster. Watch with caution.\nOverall Score: 6/10"},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=15,   ["text"]="                          \n    Because of the relatively high score I finally watched this series after years of procrastinating.\n\nSomething I liked is the interesting concept of the post 2nd Impact world, with its biblical references and the unique idea of living beings being separated by a wall, the AT-Field. \nWhile it definitely does have a very artistic style of conveying the various characters' train of thought and feelings, the series lacks action, especially in the second half. The characters especially the protagonist, are too busy with their psychological problems that the plot is not really advancing anymore. The last two episodes consist only of high speed flashing of images\n          \n        and Kanji and repeating symbolics like the opening of a door twenty times while one of the characters is hysterically fighting with their own past. \nI tend to dislike the anime when I dislike the main character. And Shinji is one of the most pathetic characters I've ever seen in an anime.\nIn the first few episodes there seemed to be good character development with Shinji, but he fell back to being pathetic until about 5 minutes before the end of the series. So practically all the character development happens in a few minutes. In the anime and particularly in the last two episodes everything is going in circles. The characters are imprisoned in their own minds going over their problems over and over again. Then from one moment to another Shinji is enlightened. The End. I was like wth?! What's going to happen to the plot? They built up a complex story of the complementary project and after episode 26 all the open ends are left open.\nLuckily there's the alternate telling of the two last episodes in End_of_Evangelion which does at least tie most of the open ends together in an almost pursuable way, but left the character development behind. This time Shinji is pathetic to the very end.\nIn the end I can only say: Art is different for anyone, and to be honest I just didn't really enjoy it.\nIt's probably like I enjoy some clean and modern artwork from sculptures to architecture or modern automotive design concepts, but I really dislike the kind of art like some of Picasso's works with intertwined limbs coming out of incomplete bodies at impossible angles, that when I look at them I always ask myself what twisted mind can produce something like that.\nIf I had to describe Evangelion with one word I would say it's twisted.\n        "},

		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    As we flutter through life, issues like insecurity, incompetence and depression mar the success we are trying to attain. Some of these faults are scars left by our past inaccuracies and some are merely circumstantial. Among peer pressure and burden of expectations, running away is easy fuel. But run away often, shelters will rumble and deprecate in numbers. As Shinji Ikari pilots the Eva, only his heart knows the reason of his constant battle. Only he seems to know that he's finding a way to save himself through saving the world. The character of Shinji is wonderfully explored, Anno poured his heart and soul into\n          \n        the character. It's all good. But what about the other characters? How are they handled? As Anno goes on building the strongest base for our protagonist, he's simultaneously expecting us to show the same level of connection with all his other drawn characters. But the reality of it half resonates with the daydream. \nThe story has its mass composed of religious elements, sometimes told through dialogue and sometimes metaphor. Initially, the plot's strength is marked by lack of knowledge. As we did not hold any knowledge of the world, its building was in great hands. But then came terrible dialogue that was spoken oft in all the right places but with horrible precision. Sometimes the most powerful moments are ruined by cheap and terrible entries in the script, much of which made me wonder how such drafts passed the editing department. At times when such dialogue is spoken, I was of the pretense that the layer of cringe would gradually wear off but the stench in the unswept debris would ruin the whole episode for me. \nFor animation that was made in 95-96, NGE looks ordinary relative to what Miyazaki brought us with Totoro in 1988. The erotic shots are often inferior products of this dated animation, the sexiness that Anno aimed for doesn't quite work 20 years later (yes, I realize how that sounds like). The use of soundtrack too wasn't as great for me as the compiled dark silence that some episodes grasped firmly. Two exceptions to that would be Kaworu's sequence where I think the show reaches its apex and the wonderful opening music. \nIn the end, I did enjoy some aspects of Evangelion but I cannot say that I consider myself to be a fan. Mostly because of its excessive iterations of the same notions. The show makes me feel like I have a memory spurt of 5 minutes wherein every modicum of ideas that I accept tends to erase itself. That is how often the show repeats its themes, evident in large packets in the last two episodes. Anno wrote the show during his depression which greatly reflects itself in Shinji. As much as I love Shinji, the same love cannot be extended to other characters, particularly Asuka who deserves so much better. Call it a masterpiece or call it wasted potential, the amalgamation of science and spirit proves to be feeble. The greater part of its essential accessory is delivered in small fractions. Only in the last five minutes of the finale could I assemble an emotional connection. As for the rest, I can already feel it evanescing. \n        "},

With revenue greater than $1.4 billion, Evangelion is a force to be reckoned with. And for the fact that there was only 1 season little less than 20 years ago, it's unbelievable how successful this show is. Is it overrated? I guess so. Does it deserve its praise? Absolutely\nStory(9): Evangelion is about teenagers in biotic war machines fighting gigantic monsters called Angels. Concept itself is not\n          \n        so original for the fact that there were godzilla(gigantic monsters) and gundam(war machines) before Evangelion. However, behind this simple concept lies an incredibly deep human and societal matters and deep connections to characters. Some of them might be faux symbolisms but I can't deny that symbolisms, analogies, and metaphors got nothing to do with the story. \nArt(8): This anime was made back in 1995. Taking that into account, mech designs, character designs, and etc are quite intricate and amazing.\nSound(9): Great sound tracks. Cruel Angel's Thesis(1995) is in the top 10 Karoke songs again? Well, that explains it.\nCharacters(10): This is where Neon Genesis Evangelion wins it all. Many characters are like icebergs: simple, yet incredibly deep\n     Shinji: Our wimpy main character. You think you can be like Kirito, jump in front of angels and beat the crap out of them? Wrong. YOU are Shinji. Shinji is very human. He's 14, mentally unstable, and is burdened with the fate of humanity. Imagine YOU being in his position.\n     Asuka: Mother of tsundere; cute, red haired, and attractive young girl. She is a female Shinji but reflects what we want to become(in a way.) On episode 22, it turns out that it was just a facade to move on with her life. She wants to grow up. She wants attentions. \n     Many characters are like this: mental problems, rotten to the core, wears a mask.....\nEnjoyment(7): It requires thinking: why would that character act that way? What would I have done? What's their relationship? Last 2 episodes were really un-satisfying and probably is the reason why it only received 8.32 here.\nOverall(9): Great psychological horror, very human; a textbook anime that everyone should watch.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion—any good YouTube video on the subject will tell you that this anime is a deconstruction of mech anime and what would happen if actual people were put into situations where they would need to pilot giant mechanical monsters in order to save the world.  As such, there's a lot of weight in the decisions that our pilots (Shinji Ikari, Asuka Langley Soryu, Rei Ayanami) and the rest of the cast make.  Furthermore, the circumstances they're given as a result of the unfortunate world they live in is crucial to understanding why the characters are the way they are (i.e. Shinji\n          \n        being a \"bitch).  I think understanding that this show is basically a mech anime about mech anime is crucial to enjoying it and understanding why this show is as acclaimed as it is.  \nStory\nAs far as plot and lore go, NGE does a fairly good job of building this world that Shinji and friends live in as it slowly uncovers historic events, partnerships, prophecies, and the like throughout the entire show.  Sure, it's confusing, but if you're paying attention you'll get the important bits.  Just don't get caught up in understanding EVERY LITTLE FACET of what's going on.  The value in the lore and plot doesn't come in the lore itself, but the underlying ideas that the lore covers: ideas such as the validity of religion, the importance of individuality, etc. etc.  \nArt and Animation\nIt's 1995.  Action sequences and general animation (conversations and interactions) throughout the show look average for the time and probably look aged now.  The mechs look like any other mechs in mech anime, in that they look cool.  The fun stuff, however, is when Gainax supposedly run out of money.  \nFirst off, the scene that made them run out of money is probably the only action scene in the anime that I can say was truly amazing, and for that alone, I can say that the general animation is good to great.  However, what they do with whatever money they have left is wonderful and I wouldn't want the anime to be any other way.  The way the anime portrays the characters' descent into insanity using what essentially become slideshows is wonderful.  In the final few scenes of the show, without spoiling anything, the animation works perfectly well in helping to convey the broader, harder to understand ideas that the anime is bringing to the audience.  In this sense, no matter what the budget was, the animation did a perfect job of working hand in hand with the anime's themes.  \nCharacter\nI'm not giving any exposition for this.  Understanding the characters and witnessing their development is the best part of the show, and i'm not about to take that away from you.  The characters are real people.  When placed in unreal situations, they'll do some amazingly intriguing things.  \nSound\nWatch it subbed.  The Japanese voice actors do a wonderful job portraying the amount of angst that their characters rightfully have.  \nSound effects are also wonderful, with the gory sounds sounding extremely gross, mechs sounding like gears and whatever else mechs sound like.  The gore is what really sells it though.  \nAnd the soundtrack is wonderfully weird, ranging from generic action OST to Handel's Hallelujah Chorus from the Messiah.  \nEnjoyment\nPersonally, I don't understand every part of the plot.  There's a lot and it's pretty confusing.  I personally find some of the characters to be annoying (which you'll find that their being annoying is completely justifiable giving their circumstances, but still).  When the soundtrack ends up playing Handel out of nowhere, I get a good laugh out of it, but that also means I get pulled out of the action—I'm less immersed.  \nThis show isn't perfect, but it's not trying to be.  Its character development is astounding, its ideas are wonderful and for some people, life-changing, its Japanese voice-acting is immersive and believable and its plot is intriguing, if not a little bit dense.  This show is a masterpiece that, in my opinion, shouldn't be compared to other anime for the simple fact that it's not trying to be other anime.  It's not trying to be successful in the way other anime would try, with heroic characters and crazy action sequences and a unique universe.  \nWatch it.  I cannot recommend this anime enough, and I believe this anime really is one of the best out there ^_^ \n        "},

She is an evil, devious jerk who always has something bad to say about her enemies, Toji (the nasty one) and Kensuke (the geeky one), makes advances to a guy twice her age, and is such a flirty kid. The only person that she is really kind to is Hikari, who is just a girl- next-door type but also a tsundere.\nShinji is always crying and rarely does anything but sit in fetal position a lot. Rei is just a boring character with no personality to her. Misato is also a tsundere, she's kind of the more level-headed type but she doesn't even care about how Asuka behaves. She just lets her get away with her know-it-all attitude! Gendo is one of the worst excuse of parenting. And what is PenPen doing in there? He's supposed to be in the arctic!\nNone of the characters made me really care or understood about what they were going through, nor their relationships.\nTowards the end, the series gets worse, the characters break down, Asuka gets comatose, and possibly suicidal. What a horrible way to write these characters, Anno. End of Evangelion is even worse, it has lots of dismemberment and kills most of its characters off.\nThank you so much Anno for ruining the life of an autistic kid like me with such a confusing, mature series.

The reason why I decided to write a review for NGE is because I was so terribly disgusted by it. I only recently started watching anime and gave this a chance because it came highly recommended and it had such high scores on this site. Having watched Mecha Anime before and because the Synopsis sounded interesting I felt I should give it a try, regardless of the fact that it was so old. \nAnd boy was I disgusted at this. Each episode was absolute torture to watch. The characters was annoying\n          \n        as hell, the plot inconclusive and the last 3 episodes was an absolute joke.\nThe introspective monologue bullshit was enough to make me go into a depression. And I was extremely put of by the Mechas being hooked up to power chords.\nIf only it was about liberating man kind from these Angel attacks, Finding some secret Angel Base and then having the lead protagonist lead an assault on the angel base (preferably after most of the female characters died and if he dealt with he's character flaws), the plot would've still been mildly acceptable. \nBut instead the plot falls flat into an excruciatingly painful psychological fruit bowl which is difficult to understand, partially due to fact that I just got too bored with it to actually pay attention to what was being said. I still have painful memories thinking back on this as I write this. I hope this review serves as a warning. So far this is the ONLY Anime that I have such a strong disliking to.

It's a mess of unintelligible symbolism and characters that are so over the top that it becomes immersion-breaking. The first half of it is just Angel of the Week. The only good I can say about it is that the angels at least looked kinda cool since they were designed by Mohiro Kitoh, author of Bokurano. But even that gets stupid after a while. Like here’s an angel that's a computer virus. And here's an angel that's a shadow thing. Points for creativity I guess. \nSomething I hear this show getting praised for is\n          \n        its symbolism, which baffles me. There is so much symbolism that means nothing that it just gets ridiculous after a while. \n“But didn't you like Penguindrum? Didn't that have excessive symbolism in it too? How can you call Eva bad when you said penguindrum was good?”\nThe difference is that penguindrum feels like it's trying to say something with its symbolism. In Eva it's just confusing and pointless. Why is there religious symbolism? Why are they called angels? When is there this thing called “Adam” that’s never explained? There’s so many attempts at sounding deep and trying to be smart and symbolic that it just gets laughable. \nNot to say that it has no redeeming qualities at all. The midway twist of the Evas being angels was really cool and didn’t come out of nowhere like it would have in some other anime. It wasn’t like every other mecha show out there, which is more than can be said for anything else besides Bokurano. Unfortunately, it did get predictable after a while. Like oh no, the Eva went out of control during testing? Oh no it did again? And again? It just got old after a while. \nWho knows, maybe I just don’t understand the depth and complexity of the story. Maybe the symbolism all makes sense. Maybe the ending isn’t complete and utter shit. Oh yeah, did I mention how confusing the ending is? Like the fucking chair scene that was supposed to be deep and philosophical or whatever but ended up being so retarded that I ended up laughing through the whole thing. Quite the psychological drama if I do say so myself. \nTo conclude, Evangelion is a grossly overrated series. It is by no means a “bad” show, but does not deserve the amount of praise it’s given. 8.32, really? Why the fuck is this rated higher than Penguindrum? I don’t understand. \ntl;dr anyone who gave Evangelion a 10 really has no idea what makes a good story"},

It’s been fifteen years since the world suffered a cataclysmic disaster, which wiped out unimaginable portions of life and land mass, a great deal of which is now permanently underwater. While the cause of the incident is unknown to the general public, those with special clearance are aware of The Angels, giant celestial beings from the heavens who’ve come to Earth with the apparent task of ending humanity as we know it. In response to this, the secret organization NERV begin to recruit a select few overbearing and overemotional young people, yes, teenagers, all of whom were born one year after\n          \n        the incident, which has been mysteriously dubbed “Second impact.” These young heroes have been tasked with piloting the Evangelion, a trio of giant cyborgs that have been proven to be the only beings capable of fighting off the extraterrestrial threat and defending the remaining populace of this post-apocalyptic world, including what few loved ones they may have, all as humanity clings to the last remnants of society!\nBut all is not what it seems, as NERV seems to have it’s own agenda, independent from the harrowing exploits of the young pilots. Their seemingly altruistic goal of protecting humanity from the ever-present threat of extinction may only be a ruse that’s concealing a deeper, perhaps even more sinister scheme. These pilots consist of the first child, Rei Ayanami, a quiet and emotionally closed-off girl who’s shrouded in mystery; The Second child, Asuka Langley Soryu, a half-German girl with deep-seated superiority issues and an attitude to match; And the third child, Shinji Ikari, estranged son of the project’s director who wants nothing more than his father’s approval. These children must battle the constant threat of the Angels as well as each other and the increasingly shady people pulling their strings, all while coming up with new strategies on the spot against enemies that never show up in the same form twice, and especially never from the same angle. In order to understand each other, they’ll have to understand themselves. Will our heroes be able to protect us from total annihilation, or will they themselves prove to be the unwitting heralds of our demise?\nOver the years, Neon Genesis Evangelion has garnered something of a larger than life reputation, which is why it’s so strange to hear people gloss over it’s massive budget restrictions. To be fair, they’re not a problem too often, as Gainax has proven themselves time and time again to be good at working under shoestring budgets, but it does become a problem once in a while, and to the show’s great detriment, it becomes a problem really early. While there are later episodes that use obvious budget saving tactics that wouldn’t fool even the greenest of novice otakus, the ugliest material of the series takes place right in episode 3, Where Shinji is settling into his new life at school. The budget for this particular episode was clearly drained bone dry, with stilted movements, frozen pictures with moving mouths for extended periods of time, and I swear I’m not making this up, a lengthy sequence where the number of students in Shinji’s class appears to change drastically between shots. Even by the standards of low budget old-school anime, this is just embarrassing.\nThankfully, it’s not the norm. it’s the exception, not the rule. There are other episodes where characters are badly drawn or inhumanly stiff, but never to the same level of concentration, and the animators clearly got better at it as the series progressed, right up until the obvious budget crash towards the end. I don’t think the budget ever really picked up, at least not to any sort of progressive degree, but it does get a lot better at preserving and allocating money, so that the big action scenes that take up the middle of the series can be just as epic as they need to be. The increase in artwork quality is also a huge point in it’s favor, as an improved grasp on framing and shading make even the stiffest of dialogue exchanges and character moments look passable at worst and thoroughly engaging at best. The character designs are a bit rough, but they’re thoughtfully done, incorporating similarities between certain characters that you don’t even realize are there until further viewings, with Shinji’s similarities to his father only being the tip of the iceberg.\nWhen I said earlier that Evangelion employs budget saving techniques that wouldn’t fool most viewers, I was of course referring to the more discerning viewers who wouldn’t be drawn in by the animators dangling keys in front of their faces. There are several moments where they stopped having the characters do stuff and instead just switch to a minimalist perspective and psychoanalyze the characters, with a thin veil of lore giving it enough of an excuse to separate it from similar Gainax shows that did the same thing, like that old trainwreck Kare Kano. It’s easy enough to get drawn in by all this psychobabble, and I’ll spend a fair amount of time later on going into detail about why you shouldn’t, but if you don’t, then you’ll likely see nothing more impressive in it than a cheap, transparent attempt to cleverly save a buck. This is concentrated mostly in the final quarter of the anime, which means you won’t have to put up with it often, but damned if seeing that one extended shot of Unit 1 and the final angel doesn’t attract most viewers to start massaging the fast forward button.\nThe music, composed almost entirely by Shiro Sagisu and distributed by King Records, received the 1997 Kobe animation award for Best Original Score, and I feel bad for whatever anime it was competing against, because they had no chance. The entire score is largely comprised of big, elaborate orchestral band pieces, and unlike the shaky at best animation quality, they go all out with the musical accompaniments. There are too many memorable tracks to count, including most of the angel battle themes(Dance like you want to win is a particular favorite of mine) and the repeated domestic tracks from the show’s more contained moments. There are a handful of pre-existing songs, like Hallelujah(The generic choir version, not the Leonard Cohen version). It’s a fantastic soundtrack, but the best part is still the opening, Cruel Angel’s Thesis, which in addition to being a great song is probably the greatest use of stock footage in an op that I’ve ever seen. The closing theme, a direct cover of Sinatra’s “Fly me to the Moon,” is sung by a different actress and in a different style every episode, in all of it’s engrishy glory.\nSince the dub for Evangelion was released over ten years ago, it contains a lot of names you might not be used to hearing. That’s not to say they don’t show up anymore... Although Sue Ulu, Jaxon Lee and Kurt Stoll have long since retired... But for the most part, they’re names that have faded from the voice acting A-list with time. The Evangelion actor who’s probably the most well known these days is Tiffany Grant, who’s still churning out an impressive amount of work 23 years into her career. She also puts forth what’s probably the best performance of the series, playing the egotistical glass cannon Asuka, speaking in flawless German when she needs to and brilliantly following along with every single psychological facet of her character, from the arrogant boasting to the more tsundere-like ranting and nagging, including what easily puts her over the top, the young fraulein’s more fragile and broken moments. Alison Keith probably comes in second with her portrayal of the fan favorite Misato, the guardian of two of the pilots as well as a strong, dependent Major seeking revenge against the Angels.\nI don’t think Spike Spencer did a bad job with Shinji, and after all, he was probably the perfect choice for the role, but the material he was given did him no favors. Shinji is a whiny and self-loathing adolescent boy, so in turn, that’s exactly what Spike plays him as, all the way down to the cracking voice and doubt-filled inflections. He didn’t exactly make the character likeable, but to be completely honest, I go back and forth on whether or not he was even SUPPOSED to be likeable, so points for accuracy. The same goes for Amanda Winn, later Amanda Winn Lee, for her performance as Rei, which she excels at despite it not being a very demanding role. She stays flat and monotoned throughout, but there’s still nuance to the performance. It is worth noting, however, that this is quite possibly the only good performance I’ve heard from her, as she is in fact my least favorite English dub voice actor. Her voice has a very uneven and unnatural quality to it, to the point that some of her roles have sounded like she was recording her lines in the back seat of a moving roller coaster, and while I’d love to give you some examples, all I have to do is point you to when she breaks character in the final episode.\nBeyond these, there aren’t really any stand-outs, as almost everyone plays their roles equally good. Gendoh Ikari had two different voice actors, one for the series and one for the Director’s Cut, but you can barely tell the difference, and I mean that in a good way. He’s kind of a flat character like Rei, but instead of apathy and a lack of emotions, Gendoh needs to be played with a very specific level of strength and determination, the voice of someone who never leaves the office and can’t help but look down on anyone who’s less committed than he is. The directors’ cut also swaps a bunch of other modern names into the cast, such as Greg Ayres, Vic Mignona, Monica Rial, and even the short-lived Mandy Clark. The adaptive writing is mostly faithful, rarely making any changes beyond rewording certain lines to match the lip flaps, or just to change the timing of certain lines and the order in which they’re said. I know that sounds like a lot, but it never really takes away from the intent of the original material, and even when it comes close to doing so, it happens during moments that are acted more than well enough to justify them. Is it as good as the dub? No, but it does grow on you if you give it a little bit of time, and it’s pretty good in it’s own right.\nIn the 20 years that it’s been out, the public perception of Evangelion has been all over the place. It’s not the MOST poorly aged anime I’ve ever seen... I can think of a few certain titles from far more recent years that have fallen much harder and faster from grace... It was once considered one of the greatest anime of all time, if not THE greatest, which is an attitude that’s not only declined, but in today’s market, Eva worship is a simple, recognizable sign of rookie status, someone who hasn’t seen enough titles to compare it to. There are still die hard fans out there, who believe it to be some profound psychological masterpiece... We’ll stick a pin in that idea for now... But the growing critical consensus is, and has been for a while now, that Evangelion is little more than pretentious nonsense. In order to talk about this anime, I’m going to have to address these concerns, because no, I don’t think it’s THAT pretentious. I’m aware that I may be alone in this, but from what I can tell, a few pretentious elements have been blown way out of proportion.\nFirst of all, the definition of pretentious is as follows; Is someone or something is attempting to impress by pretending to have greater importance, wisdom, depth, meaning, etc. than it actually possesses, then it falls into the official definition. Things aren’t pretentious because they seem smart, but because they’re not as smart as they want to look, and frankly, to tell the difference, you’ve gotta be smart enough to compare what’s being boasted to what’s actually there. In the case of Evangelion, there are a few pretentious elements at play, but it takes up nowhere near the majority of the material. For starters, I have to call them out on this because I don’t think anyone else has, there’s the episode titles, and I can provide a quick example; In an episode where two kisses take place, the title will be “Those women longed for the touch of other’s lips, and offered them their kisses,” or something, I’m paraphrasing. Titles that sound overly busy and full of purple prose that are meant to give the feeling of greater meaning or profundity to otherwise unimportant moments.\nThe other example is some stream-of-consciousness material that occurs toward he end of the series. I won’t go into too much about the bullshit this part of the series is loaded with, because I already said a lot of it in the animation portion, and besides, other reviewers have done a far better job of it than I ever could. Seriously, if you want to see the philosophies of Evangelion get a triumphant curb-stomp, look up Jesuotaku’s review, it’s not as hard to find as you might think. What I will say is that there’s a pretty good rule of thumb for judging pretension... If a story uses very little words in order to say a lot, then it;’s probably profound in some way. If it uses a ton of words to say very little, then yeah, pretentious. I won’t give away what’s going on in the official series ending, but to paraphrase(something I can do far too easily), it’s saying that with billions of different perspectives of awareness existing in the world, it’s impossible to fully understand anything, least of all other people and even yourself. They find so many different ways to say this, through constant repetition and rephrasing, that it very soon starts to feel like padding for episode length.\nSo yes, there’s some obvious pretension going on, but to it’s credit, that stuff is mostly only relegated to the final quarter of the series, and even then, barely half of that. Having said that, the series doesn’t get off to the best start either, as the first quarter of episodes suffer a slight case of growing pains, introducing a few of it’s main characters, who really don’t flourish well on their own, and the lackluster animation from those episodes doesn’t offer much support. Thankfully, the very concept of teenagers with room to grow piloting giant cyborgs to fight celestial monsters is more than promising enough to carry even the most reluctant viewers through, and thank God for that, because something happens a quarter of the way into the series that automatically brings all of it’s best qualities to the forefront. Evangelion truly shines when it’s in it’s element, with all three pilots gathered and a brand new Angel showing up to challenge them in brand new ways each episode, and the level of creativity and thoughtful writing that goes into these battles is nothing short of insane. It’s a bit episodic, yes, but it’s by far the best Eva has to offer.\nUnfortunately, this all adds up to an extremely inconsistent level of quality throughout the series. I’ve seen shows that started out great but went downhill towards the end, and likewise, I’ve seen shows that were difficult to get into, but turned out to be rewarding at the end. Well, Evangelion is one of very few anime whose best material is in the middle. For more than half of the episode count, you could easily count this series as not only one of the greatest action anime of all time, but one of the greatest mech shows of all time, and that’s coming from a guy who’s not easily impressed by giant robots. It’s exciting, it’s inventive, and it’s damn funny to boot, but that’s still only a portion of the series. Now, you might be asking, how is this possible? The truth is, while Evangelion has many different problems plaguing it, there’s one issue in particular that I believe to be the core of everything wrong with it. For all the intense action and sci-fi fantasy that it offers, for all of the rich lore that’s so easy to get lost in, for all the intrigue keeping us guessing, let’s just say there’s a reason I worded my plot synopsis to not highlight any character in particular.\nAll of Evangelion’s worst problems begin and end with Shinji Ikari, who is... By all conceivable measures... A terrible main character. He doesn’t do anything you’d expect a protagonist to do, and he winds up hurting not only the story as a result, but other characters as well. The reason the middle of the story is the best part is largely because, for that stretch of episodes, Shinji’s not treated like a central main character. He’s not given any special attention, or any special development. Starting immediately from the debut of Asuka, Shinji just kind of fades into the rest of the cast. If you took any given episode from this portion out of context, you could be forgiven for thinking that Misato was the main character, or that there ISN’T even a main character, and instead the focus is on an ensemble cast, or more specifically the three pilots as a unit. I know a lot of people give Asuka shit for being egotistical and annoying, but she is the life of this series, as Shinji is way too busy reacting to her capriciousness and Rei actually shows some personality in response to the competitive Asuka provoking her.\nI may complain that Shinji has so little agency that he makes Jupiter Jones look like Indiana Jones, but he gets more tolerable the less he’s expected to do, and that should have been a warning sign right from the first story-board panel. As a cypher, his job is to have the plot and premise of the story explained to us through him, and he does the bare minimum of this, learning about the fight between Angels and Evas for our sake before breaking off from the larger plot by whining about his own self-interests. He’d rather complain and refuse to make any forward progression, but due to his lack of agency, his refusals ultimately amount to nothing. Throughout the anime, the only thing he’s interested in is gaining the approval of others, and he gets so singularly invested in his own shit that they had to introduce an entirely different character... Misato’s “It’s complicated” guy Kaji... Just to get the ball rolling on what’s supposed to be shocking reveals later in the series. That’s supposed to be the main character’s job, and the fact that his story is so entirely divorced from what’s actually going on behind the scenes creates a huge tonal dissonance that ruins the impact of what could have been a much more interesting build to the climax.\nThere’s a critiquing device out there that has you asking one very simple question: Whose story is it? Who’s the real main character? Who has the motivation, who has the arc, who’s affected most by the plot? Well, let’s look at Shinji. He wants approval from his father. Okay, I’ve heard of worse arcs... How does it play out? Well, if Gendoh was a more interesting character, which I’m sad to say he’s not, then he’d use his heartlessness and lack of love for his son to manipulate the kid, using Shinji’s want as a carrot on a string, offering false hope that Shinji would uncover so he could reject his own father and rise above it as a stronger character. Instead, the writers make no attempt to hide how little Shinji matters to Gendoh, making him as unlikable as possible to the detriment of the plot. We know Gendoh will never love Shinji, because there’s no nuance to his character, leaving Shinji to be motivated by little other than the fact that he’s good at something he thinks others can’t do. We’re supposed to grab onto his belief in his father’s humanity, but when Gendoh’s heartlessness is played up to the point that he winds up making borderline nonsensical decisions just to look as evil as possible, it just feels like everything our hero does is in vain.\nTowards the end of the series... And I’m going to try and avoid spoilers here as much as possible... Something disastrous occurs, involving one of Shinji’s friends. The build-up is contrived as hell, with everyone connected to the event either assuming Shinji already knows what his friend is doing, or just not wanting to tell him for one reason or another, and it gets even more contrived when the thing goes wrong, and Asuka is cut off from telling him, because Gendoh’s solution relies heavily on his son being in the dark, but he shouldn’t even KNOW that Shinji’s in the dark over it, and that’s not even considering that he could have easily explained the actual problem to them while achieving a better outcome. But hey, screw logic, we’ve gotta make him look like a complete sociopath so that Shinji can rebel... Again... And try to leave... Again... And ultimately come back for the same reasons that he came back before, albeit with greater stakes. It’s probably the worst episode in the series, and it serves as a perfect example of how the writers went out of their way to keep Shinji in his own little bubble.\nOf course, what Shinji and Gendoh DO have in common, aside from their looks, is that neither of them are given a proper backstory. Oh, we see them in the past, but it’s always in someone else’s backstory, and we’re never shown anything from their own. We see Gendoh as a part of Professor Fuyutsuki’s backstory, but we never learn where he came from, what his motivation was before Yui came into his life, or what drove him apart from his son. Speaking of the devil, we see Shinji as a child in other peoples’ backstories, and we learn that he ran away to live with his teacher, but we’re never shown why he ran away, what his life was like with Gendoh as a single parent, what his life with his teacher was like... All we know is that not having his father love him was hard on him, but he was told this, not shown it, which makes him very difficult to sympathize with. So who is the main character? It’s hard to say. If you include the movie, then Asuka has the best arc. Rei has the best backstory. Misato has the best relation to the ever thickening plot. And yet, Shinji is the focal character, dealing with issues that are annoying in the beginning and pushed aside for the show’s best material, before they have to pull some pretentious post-modern existentialist bullshit just to give him a resolution that it would take a theatrical ending to not conclude, but ultimately rewrite by using him as a tool for other character’s resolutions... Which is where he’s at his best.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion, at least the original series, is currently out of print, although I have heard rumors that Funimation is planing to rescue it. A couple of different collections are available online, including the thin-pack Perfect collection, which I luckily bought when ADV films put it out twelve years ago. It’s worth about 350 dollars now. The movie, End of Evangelion, which is required viewing if you want to skip the last two bullshit episodes of the series, as it’s really the only way to complete the experience. Another film, Death and /rebirth, is literally the worst, so don’t get tricked into wasting your time and money on it. The Rebuild movies, released a decade after the series debuted and dubbed for American release by Funimation, is much easier to find, at least in regard to the three films that have been released so far, and I do highly recommend them. There are also several manga adaptations of the series, most of which are available stateside, but I haven’t read any of them.\nEvangelion has been a highly influential series ever since it was released, with it’ themes, ideas, and story elements being simultaneously ripped off wholesale and used with respect, to the point that even Attack on Titan probably wouldn’t exist without it(seriously, compare the two). It also proved, for better or worse, that anime could deliver more depth and mature themes than people were used to, especially from a mass-marketable action series. While it may have struggled to find it’s stride and stumbled towards the finish line, you have to remember that before Eva came out, there really wasn’t anything like it in existence, it’s similarities to other Gainax properties aside. It was a pioneer, and it took a lot of major risks, which paid off a thousand-fold in helping to form the market as we know it today. It’s a flawed series, with uneven quality and one of the worst protagonists in anime history... I mean, this is basically the story of an entire chessboard where the focus is on a pawn who doesn’t even make it to the other side... I still highly recommend watching it. Just don’t forget to skip the last two episodes and conclude with End of Evangelion instead. I give Neon Genesis Evangelion a 7/10.\n        "},

I wish i understood the language (i'll be damned if i watch a dub that isn't like dragon ball or some shit) Just so i can play it as ambient noise.

He does something better for a moment and we will be thinking that everything is going well.\n3. Something terrible happens to him or he does something stupid.\n4.

This anime takes a giant, steamy dump on that. \nNGE plot is secondary. This anime is PEOPLE. The characters are people. And their internal struggles are so damn real that they don't just drag you along with. They overcome you. They become a part of you.\nNGE's characters and the relationships between them, are more realistic than every other character and every other relationship  in anime, with a few exceptions. I can say that because this anime understands things about people, that we don't really like to admit ourselves\nThis anime\n          \n        understands that people don't always rise to the challenge when faced with adversity. We want that to be true of all of us. We want it so bad that we portray it in our media all the time. We show countless examples of humans rising to the challenge because that is what we want to see within ourselves. But NGE understands, that in reality, that's not the case. Sorry but no, the average Joe is NOT be capable of being strong enough to stand against the odds, which is why we value people can do that, as much as we do, cause those people are above average. Nge gets that just because you have to be the one to save the world, doesn't mean you will. \nThis anime understands that relationships are hard, and I don't mean just romantic ones. Anime tend to be caricatures of people and relationships. Anime tends to exist in a more pleasant world where characters are more honest with themselves, their motivations are simplistic, and they are honest with each other. They always speak what they feel out loud, to everyone, so everyone knows whats up. They always have a grasp of what they want in life and are eerily consistent at staying the course. \nBut reality doesn't work that way. The majority of what you're feeling stays in your head . Why because often times, especially at the age of adolescence, we don't fully understand what were feeling ourselves, let alone trusting someone else to know what the answer is. And because of his relationships can fall apart because  we don't express what were feeling to each other. Because of Bad communication. There are countless examples of bad relationships that can be solved with better communication, I'm sure you can think of a few in your own life. But often times we don't say what we have to or what we should or how we feel. NGE IS human relationships. It understands the inability to speak up when somethings bothering you. it understands the talking behind the back. It captures the unsaid feelings, the contradictions that exist within you, the confusion, the conflict. It's not always as severe as NGE makes it out to be, but let's be honest, we don't come to shows like NGE or any other thriller to watch characters live healthy normal lives. \nThis anime shows you that people are't as simple as we let ourselves believe,it tells us that the obnoxious girl in your class isn't simply a bitch and might be hiding sadness behind hr cruelty(Asuka Langley Sohryu, possibly the saddest, and most realistic Tsundere ever), that the parent who abandoned you isn't simply a deadbeat and could be compassionate(Commander Ikari), that the kind, gentle hearted friend might not be as happy as he appears to be(Shinji Ikari)and that the invisible girl in the back of your class might be struggling in silence(Rei Ayanami). It understands that all those people are human beings who love and hurt like you do. \ncombine all of that beautiful and complex chracter work with Hideaki Anno's claustrophobic direction style that carries his patent use of intense, powerful imagery, his effective use of silence,  his fearless and lvl headed approach to sexuality, and his intelligent use of Symbolism, Metaphor, Double entendre, and Diction and you get something that is a masterpiece\nNGE challenges the very nature of humanity, and after watching you realize you aren't the same person you were going in. I genuinely believe that. But I won't be able to convince some of you. This anime is too controversial for that\nI promise you that some of you WILL hate the characters. \nSome of you Will hate the direction.\nYou WIll hate the plot(which is understandable. I hate it too)\nAlot of you will hate this and call it junk. But that's okay.\nBecause that is what this anime is about. Much like Paintings by Picasso or Van Gogh, his anime is about how it makes you feel. The fact that there are so many powerful, and different opinions about this tells me, tha like those great paintings, has become a masterpiece that people will debate for decades, for centuries even(if the anime genre last that long, but that's a whole other discussion)\nTo conclude,\nThis isn't an anime that you can just watch. You experience it. So do yourself a favor, and let yourself live this anime.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    A highly polarizing masterpiece.\nAs evidenced by that first line...I love this show. I've given it a ten, it's on my favorites list, it's my second favorite anime of all time, hell as partially ashamed as I am to admit it I've even written (some not very good) fanfiction about the damn series. It's obvious that I have a deep appreciation of this series, but it's not a series for everyone. So I'm going to present the show to you, warts and all. If I can convince you to give it a try then great, but if not then the review is still doing it's job.\nLet's\n          \n        start with the plot: The year is 2015, back in 2001 there was an incident called \"Second Impact\" which killed a good chunk of the population and made the southern hemisphere completely unlivable. The rest of the world was still effected though, the sea levels rose and the world was perpetually stuck in the summer season. If that wasn't enough there are also giant monsters called \"Angels\" that occasionally pop up. Only the organization called Nerv has a way to fight them. A 14 year old boy named Shinji is called to Tokyo 3 by his Father (the leader of Nerv) and is told to pilot a giant robot called an Evangelion. This isn't your typical giant robot story though, this is a show all about it's characters. So let's talk about them.\nShinji Ikari: He's well...a bit of a whiny little bitch. But that's the point though, it's a realistic reaction to being told to pilot a giant robot you've never seen in your life, fight the terrifying monster, and save the world. He suffers from something the show calls the \"Hedgehog's Dilemma\" which means he refuses to get emotionally close to anyone for fear of being hurt. This stems from the fact that the father kind of abandoned him right after the death of Shinji's mother, keep in mind that Shinji was four years old at the time. \nRei Ayanami: One of Shinji's fellow Eva pilots. She's completely emotionless, she's very close to Gendo (Shinji's father) though. There's more to talk about when it comes to Rei but that's all spoiler territory. Long story short if you know who Yuki Nagato is then you have a basic idea of what Rei's like.\nAsuka Langley Soryu: Yes, she is an anime character that has a middle name. That like never happens. With hair almost as fiery as her personality this red headed vixen is another fellow Eva pilot. What makes her unique is that she actually enjoys piloting, Rei doesn't have any special feelings about it and Shinji is straight up terrified but Asuka revels in the fact that she's an eva pilot. She also has a superiority complex and is a bit of a bitch, being overbearing and what not to everyone around her. However her ego is almost directly connected to her ability to pilot an Eva, so when the notion that she's the best pilot is challenged...well it's not pretty.\nThe last character I'll be talking about is Misato Katsuragi: She's the one in charge of the Eva's missions and the pilots. However when she's not on the job she's not very responsible, this purple haired beauty spends as much time drinking as she does planning the next mission. She's not exactly lady-like either, passing most of the chores like cleaning and cooking to Shinji since she isn't all that great at doing either. \nYour enjoyment of the show hinges on whether or not you can become invested in these characters, even when they're not the most likeable. If you can then congratulations, you've just discovered a great character study about a cast of interesting and flawed characters. If not then you just discovered 26 episodes of whining. \nThis show has to have interesting characters because it ain't winning any awards for animation. Evangelion was notorious for it's tight budget, especially when they were hit with a budget cut near the end of the shows run. The fights look pretty damn great for 90's anime standards but everything else...eh. That's not to say it looks bad, because it doesn't. But just know that the show tries to keep animation to a minimum at times. With characters tending to cover their mouths so they didn't have to animate lip flaps and the fact that on three separate occasions the show just ceases to animate. In three different scenes the show will just stop and show a still frame for like a minute. The last time it does this in episode 24 it actually works and enhances the drama of the scene. The other two times just look out of place. Like I said earlier though when the show does use it's limited budget to the best of it's ability and the fight scenes are creative and well animated.\nThe music is also just ok. The OP \"A Cruel Angel's Thesis\" is the catchiest damn theme and the remixes of \"Fly me to the moon\" make great endings but the ost used in the show itself is...fine. Nothing wrong with it, but the ost of the Rebuild movies blow this Soundtrack out of the water.\nMy conclusion is exactly what I said all the way at the beginning of the review, it's a highly polarizing masterpiece. If you can get into the show then you'll most likely love it, if you're turned off by the characters then you'll most likely hate it. \n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Everyone seems to have to watch Evangelion at some point, if for nothing else, so that they can wax philosophical about it.  \nI avoided Evangelion for a long time as I had heard that the director had a lot of mental issues he was dealing with at the time, as well as the anime running out of budget near the end and having a somewhat \"interesting\" resolution.  I was concerned that it was going to end up as too much of a mess to end up making any sense, but after viewing TTGL and a few other Gainax studio mech shows, I figured\n          \n        I should take finally take a look.\nWell, I finally ended up getting around to watching the series, and I have to say that I'm left at a bit of a loss as to how to properly evaluate it, especially considering my personal reaction was to be turned off by just about everything about it, but also wanting to try to be fair towards what (I think) the show was trying to do.\nWith regards to the technicals of the anime: \nThe art is a bit dated, but is actually pretty good for the time.  Many of the mechas and angels are unique and interesting to look at.  There are issues as the series goes on with reusing things quite a bit, but for the most part, the art is fine.  \nThe sound and voice acting are pretty good.  For the material that they were working with, my opinion is that the voice actors did an admirable job.  The theme is a classic, and most of the soundtrack choices are nice as well.\nAs the technicals are done fairly well, it's a shame what actually ended up being presented as a story through the characters just didn't work that well given the issues I mentioned earlier.\nThere are occasions where art through adversity and stories told through depression make for some interesting looks into the darker side of character development.  The problem is that as opposed to creating compelling story material, Evangelion relies heavily on shock factor, faux religious imagery (as the author himself has stated), and self indulgent trips into pointless downward spirals of self pity.\nI think that different people are going to get different things out of Evangelion, but as someone who doesn't, and never has for that matter, had to cope with depressive episodes, I don't think that Evangelion was actually written for someone like me.  \nThe major characters Shinji, and Asuka have a host of personal issues and angst that is related to the story, and unfortunately they are surrounded by people and situations that do nothing but enable downward spirals of negative character development for the most part.  I was left wondering where the psychiatrists and emotional counselors were hanging out, because it seems like everyone trying to save the world had no business doing so.  \nGenerally speaking, you need something in your heroes to root for, and while heroes are allowed to be flawed, at some point, you expect them to put aside their personal issues for the good of others.  Generally speaking, outside of a few acts, this is a show where the heroes never get out of their own selfish, narcissistic, woe is me silliness and things continue to spiral because of it.  Having the director going through mental issues during the production no doubt had a lot of influence in this.\nMy biggest problem with the characters was I kept waiting for the payoff, where the heroes would ultimately step up and become something to aspire to, and I was left with a character study of what might happen if you were to throw psychologically damaged and unstable people together and tasked them with \"saving the world\".  It's a pretty frustrating experience from that standpoint.\nEvangelion isn't completely without merit though.  As a case study in mental issues and depressive cases, it will likely resonate with people who have suffered or currently suffer from depression or some type of angst.  There is a layer of tragedy to the interactions between these broken individuals that could potentially be related to.  As I mentioned earlier, as someone without these particular issues, I found it really difficult to get through the series and relate to the characters.  I kept hoping for meaningful resolution and growth that never quite got there in the end.  \nThese problems ended up making Evangelion a slog to get through.  As the budget ran out and the story took the tone shift into the downward spirals of character development, I was relying on inertia to get me through the final few episodes.  Much has been written on the ending to Evangelion, and my general feeling is that I was disappointed with it.  Budget issues or not, rehashing the characters problems and trying to add some kind of deeper meaning to the narcissistic self-pity was taxing and in the end, it felt at best a cop out, and at worst a middle finger to everyone who hung around.  \nMuch has also been written about the supposed religious symbolism that the show used as well, but I tend to side with the folks who believe that it really doesn't mean much unless you are trying to insert your own meaning.  I tend to view the religious symbolism in much the same way that I view the Galactic Empire in Legend of Galactic Heroes nordic religiousness.  It was tossed in there to add a bit of flavor, but not much else.  There isn't anything wrong with inserting a personal meaning, as this show leaves you with a lot of questions if you look for them, but personal interpretations are just that, personal. \nAt the end of the day, I understand why the show is discussed as much as it is, but I'm also disappointed that it's discussed as much as it is as I can definitely see a path towards what happened to more modern anime because of this show. \nTengan Toppa Gurren Lagann is a better (albeit cheesier in many ways) mecha story by the same studio.  I have rewatched that show after Evangelion and have a deeper appreciation for TTGL reconstructing what Evangelion deconstructed.  At the end of the day, I believe that an anime ultimately stands on its entertainment value.  Evangelion was a chore to sit through.  I didn't hate it, I certainly didn't like it, but I was even happier when I finished it and could check it off the list as I really wasn't enjoying it all that much and was a bit frustrated by how it ended.\nIt's tough to recommend people avoid something like Evangelion, as it is discussed so much that just about everyone who gets into this medium is going to be exposed to it sooner or later.  There is some merit is seeing it if for no other reason than to help connect the dots on how anime was affected by it, but I don't consider this to be a show that I can say I enjoyed. \nBest I can offer as a final thought is to go in without preconceptions and see what you get out of it.   \n"},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    There exist in this world shows that can change lives forever. Anime that are so unique that they are capable of going above and beyond their respective leagues and ascend into said league's pantheon. Anime that change the utter landscape of your thoughts and say: \"How am I still alive after watching this?\"\nYes, Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of those kind of shows. One of those that are so inexplicably bad in such a unique way that it manages to turn everything it had going for it into a rather big and inescapable problem. I can barely think of anything good to say about Evangelion\n          \n        in it's fourteen hour run time, including both movies which is rather impressive since I'm rather optimistic in my critiques. But, after having to suffer through this fourteen hour horror then having to do so AGAIN just so I can have fresh knowledge for this review, my patience for this series has dwindled into little more the volume of a black hole. So, before I completely lose it Joker-style, let's begin.\nFrom the get-go, you get a sense that Evangelion is not a normal series with a few freaky visuals, a not-so-typical protagonist in the form of Shinji Ikari with the lesser protagonists being Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley Soryu. This story revolves around these three fighting against monstrous aliens called Angels who want to initiate Third Impact AKA Armageddon and wipe humanity off the face of the Earth. Well, that was the original premise as a sort of disguise since the real plot is all about deconstructing the tropes commonly associated with the mecha genre, specifically that of child soldiers as well as a deep look into the psyche of the characters themselves.\nSounds good right? Well, there's a few problems. The first one is that because of the character study and deconstruction, the show kind of drops the whole \"fighting aliens to protect the world\" part except when it's needed to bash in the flaws of the characters, becoming little more than a side note. Which is really big shame since the Angels all have very interesting designs and powers, albeit no personality but that's yet another trope deconstructed that also backfires as it makes the Angels more sympathetic (especially one Angel in particular who was a godsend that could not live in this cruel world for long) while the main organization representing humanity, SEELE and one of its divisions NERV, less likeable to the point I myself wanted the Angels to win.  Although that's partially because i either A) Hate everyone in this show (Which I will get to) or B) want to mercy kill those who don't belong in A.\nSecond is the deconstruction in the fact that it becomes rather redundant early on in the series. One of the main tropes discussed is the use of child soldiers in a war against aliens from outer space with the world in the balance. This would be an interesting deconstruction if not for the fact that most people can deduce this without ever seeing Evangelion. People are already stressed out by the world around with the day-to-day crap that transpires in our lives, not to mention the curve-balls life throws at us. And we are also well aware of the fact that war is hell, a fact that has been persistently thrown at us from many different angles. Even something that usually isn't very serious like Fairy Tail is aware and conscious of this fact so you don't need to beat it into us! And we were all children at some point (Hell, I'm only 18) so we are aware of the stress from then as well. SO we have a pretty good grasp on how harsh and stressful something with all those actors mashed together would be like, which is not pretty in the slightest, and then you multiply that by the number \"saving the world.\" The other deconstructions aren't much better like charging in unprepared and how a big ego will get you killed in battle. But it's constant shouting of these tropes is annoying that it feels like the show has an ego the size of Kabia times Sheldon to the power of Vegeta. And that's being generous.\nThird and finally is the character study. The show takes pride in smashing the characters to bits and pieces to show us how they are on the inside, how they tick and why they do so. However, a smart or at least observant person will notice most of these things right away. Like how Shinji is a self-hating person who lives for the love and approval of others which is pretty much shoved in our faces with his Extreme Doormat personality and his happiness and being praised. Asuka is very similar in that she craves attention and praise, which is shown through her rash actions and pride. The only person I can think of who is both interesting enough to even care about a character study is Rei. The others are either inferable or become uninteresting for other reasons that shall be discussed below. So it's like making a ship with one single hull and having it set sail for the same oceans that sunk the Titanic, which oddly enough gave afloat to many an actor's career. \nAnd the show comes to such a mind screwy, indecipherable mess that it hasn't made sense even with two decades of study. Honestly, as you will see by this review, I didn't care. \nOh, and the religious symbolism. Ignore it, I'm pretty sure it's just a pretty decoration. The Angel's names do have some relevance but you have to go out of your way to find them and this series is just not worth it.\nOnward to the protagonists. Of the main three, each one has a specific personality along with a specific way at dealing with the world's bullcrap, leading to the reveal of different aspects of their personalities both good and bad. Along the way, these begin to develop beyond the people they were before into different yet similar individuals who become more and more capable at life's troubles, including the saving the world bit. However, my problems related to these three will come up later.\nEveryone else is either meh or rage inducing. For one, we got SEELE, a mysterious organization who plans on enacting something called \"Instrumentality\" (See, not even the titles make sense). However, their reasons, or reason, is that they believe that humanity cannot live as it is. Which would make sense if most of the reason why humanity is in such a state of misery is because of them and if they were talking about the world before, then humanity wasn't the one who needed to change it was them! In fact, this show's constant repeating of \"the world sucks\" is gonna be a whole other section. None of them get any personality beyond \"old bureaucrats that are mysterious.\" Even the one with the La Forge visor wasn't memorable at all. The only one I remember was some vaguely green dude who looked like someone out of the Boondocks and thus I imagined him like Granddad Freeman to get through half the episodes. (Piece of advice to any anime creators, or creators in general; If I have to imagine one of your characters is from a crass, dumb toilet comedy show when it's supposed to be in an intellectual show because they're so bland, you've screwed up.) \nNERV isn't much better. With the exceptions of Kaji, honestly my favorite adult in the series for being such a good mentor fro Shinji and just for being an interesting character in general, and Gendo, whose motivations, dedication and subtle similarities to his son make a rather interesting and surprisingly pitiable character, every other adult in the series has earned nothing but my disinterest or my anger. The three technobabble-spouting assistance have barely any personality or really anything for me to care about them. In fact, with certain facts about the Angels known to me and a disregard for the mental and physical well being of several children, I was pretty sure they didn't care about life in general and were only working at NERV to save their own asses. Ritsuko basically boils down to \"Hates Mom, Hates Rei, Smart, Gendo-Yandere and Misato's opposite.\" I really think that I shouldn't be able to boil down a character like that unless they were likeable and like many people in this show, Ritsuko slowly becomes less and less likeable to the point were I laughed at her in misery. Misato was alright, kind of I guess, but her constantly trying to get Shinji to grow up and adjust to the world around him. This message would be fine except for a few factors: A) I can't stress this one enough: HE'S FOURTEEN! He is just beginning to learn about the world and himself, just beginning to see and discover what the world is to him. You cannot rush this process! You can help him along this path but forcing him down it is just gonna make things worse! B) He's emotionally and psychologically damaged! Shinji is not gonna be able to progress at a normal pace since he's been both mentally scarred by the world around him and a certain event I cannot get into as well as emotionally scarred by his father. And C) He has the entire world on his shoulders, he cannot develop with all that stress on him.\nNext up is the animation. The animation is usually pretty fluid and well-done, especially for it's time. There are a few instances where animation is reused or there is very little animation at all but considering the time period and the budget of the show, I'd let it pass. The problem here is the fact on how they use the animation and they use it to disturb you. First off, that Angel Fetus baby. That was kind of creepy and this is coming from a horror movie fan. Another instance they use the animation to completely disgust the viewer was in episode 22 with Asuka's Mind Rape in which she goes through several female characters talking in her body and then it goes through a bunch of random word and images flashing by with Asuka's scream as it's sound track. Let me be blunt and say \"No body wanted to hear or see that.\" If it was to hammer in the point that Asuka is psychologically scarred then I defer you to my fifth paragraph. And if you need anymore examples I need only three words: End Of Evangelion.\nThe sound of the show is alright, it has about average music and voice acting (Minus the dub which was atrocious even by my standards) but the notable piece is the show's theme: Cruel Angel's Thesis. A nice little poppy song that just screams \"90's\". But, as you guessed it, Evangelion manged to screw that up too. At first, the theme is a welcome oasis of peppiness in a sea of uneasiness in the first part but the visuals are just a bunch of nonsensical flashes of images from the series and frames detailing what they are that go by too fats to accomplish anything but a mild yet enjoyable mind screw. Then when episode 16 or so, the theme seems like it's trying to lower your guard so the rest of the show can hit you with a volley of punches and kicks in whi8ch it gives you no time to recover from. It feels underhanded and downright disgusting. What is supposed to get me hyped up for the show instead fills me with dread and loathing.  Another thing is the use of classical music, which is supposed to sound sophisticate and grandiose when it's actually sounding more akin to demons war bellow. \nAnd now we reach the final part of the show, the part that has dammed it to the center of the ninth circle of hell, right in the ice of Lucifer's buttcheeks. The overall feel. I said before that Neon Genesis Evangelion had rather good and likeable characters. However, I did state that I had a problem with this. What is that problem you ask? Well, it's the fact that they make these characters TOO likeable for their own good.  Because these characters are both likeable and relatable, we form a bond with them. We cry when they cry, we laugh when they laugh, we cheer when they cheer and we feel utter joy upon seeing them evolve beyond who they were before.. In a normal show, this would be excellent! Here however, you actually get punished for this. Because when the show gets to the character study, it feels the need to utterly smash any development the characters once had into microscopic pieces and then proceeds to smash the characters themselves until they are nothing more than death-seeking, despair-filled shells of their former selves that you want to take out to the country side and give them the sweet embrace of death. You see that? By the end of the show, I wanted the main characters dead not out of anger but out of sorrow, out of pity. What makes this even worse is that you've developed such a bond with these characters that you feel every ounce of their pain, of their sorrow, of their despair. \nOf course, considering the type of show this is, I'm honestly not surprised anymore. This show repeatedly hammers in the point that the world sucks so many times and with such ferocity that it ends up making the world and everyone in it look much much worse than it actually is. It shows nothing but the worst of humanity, the scum, the shit, the bottom-feeders, the low-lifes, the corrupt and everything other possible horror of humanity it can conjure up. It says that it's all about one boy's journey to accepting the world and himself but between the horrors I've seen and heard, this show either screwed up so bad that it create a reality destroying paradox or that was just a disguise used to mask it's real message: The world is shit, everyone is an asshole at best and the world is better off dead. To that I say: No. The world may be like that sometimes, it may beat us down without mercy, the people in it maybe assholes at best and maybe we are better off dead but that isn't all. There is great beauty in this world of ours, there is great kindness capable within everyone and life, as depressing and dark it can be, is still better than death. \nFor all it's so called intelligence, Evangelion apparently can't get that through its thick, metal skull. Though it constantly tries to break the viewer, which at first succeed with me, it also pawned many others that fought against it and triumph in the end, showing that this show is nothing more than a straw nihilist. Though they became depressed after it's production, Gainax bounced back stronger than ever with the OVA FLCL, which pretty much washed away any depression caused by this show through many of the same methods just with a bit more respect and care.  Puella Puella Madoka Magika, as generic as some of it's deconstructions maybe, showed that you can deconstruct a genre without eliminating the hope in it. If anything, it strengthened aspect of hope in Magical Girl anime. Hell, it couldn't even do itself right! After Hideki Anno, the director of the series was done, he was left in a considerably better spot. SO much so that he made a series of Evagelion movies that were improved so much that they have garnered my praise, unlike this show. Oh, but what about the mecha genre? Surely that is where Evangelion shines brightest right? Nope! After FLCL came another mecha show of Gainax's, one that is it's equal if not superior in intelligence that both deconstructed and reconstructed the mecha genre, absorbing all the darkness this show had to make itself shine brighter than any other mecha anime, heralded as a modern classic. An anime that went above and beyond, proving that you could respect your characters, respect the tropes that went along with them and have an overly all optimistic tone while still being intelligent and insightful. That's right, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann did your job better, Evangelion! \nI have nothing else to say. This show is it's own unique brand of bad, turning anything good about it into shit. The interesting plot bit it in the ass, the character study bashed it's kneecaps in, the deconstruction broke it's feet, the characters snapped its fingers, the art broke it's hands, the art broke its arms and its overall tone stabbed it's eyes out. I know that this show is usually regarded as a show about a boy overcoming depression but Evangelion doesn't have enough respect for its characters to accomplish something like that. Not to mention, again, other shows like FLCL did that better. The only notable thing about this show is how vile and twisted it is, which is to be excepted of a man going insane at the time. In short, Evagelion is an awful, spiteful, vile show that you should not watch. If you like it, fine. But I'm just here to warn other people against seeing it as my job as a human being. Good night! \n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Spoiler alert: The last two minutes of this series will make you want to put your fist through your laptop screen, then punch yourself in the face.\nFor two decades I have known that Evangelion is considered a classic, must-see example of Japanese animation and story-telling. I wanted to love it. Duh. Who wants to hate things? Hating things is an emotional and exhausting experience. Loving stuff is always a preferable experience. But that couldn't stop me. I do not understand the critical and fan reaction to this series.\nThe characters all need to be slapped, Asuka and Shinji in particular. Shinji spends the entire series sulking\n          \n        and whining about his dad and being an Eva pilot. Asuka also spends it whining, but for attention. Rei is barely even present as a character, having less personality than a pair of beige slacks. The cast of characters is frustrating and unlikable, so that can't possibly be why people like this show. Maybe they like the mood?\nWell, no, because the tone of the show is all over the place. The first 6-7 episodes are a bit dark and mysterious, setting up a conspiratorial tone for the series. Then suddenly, the next 6-7 episodes are all light-hearted, fluffy, and action-oriented. The series suddenly returns to the dark, suspicion-drenched mystery for a couple of episodes before veering off-course again in its final moments, deciding it wants to be a David Lynch film. This makes for a frustrating viewing experience, as Evangelion apparently doesn't know what kind of story it wants to be or what kind of fans it wants to target. So it can't be the mood that draws people in. Maybe it's the plot?\nI doubt it. The plot itself is an unremarkable conspiracy story that dissolves into an unrelated clusterfuck at the end and doesn't answer a single question it poses. Why do the Evas need to be piloted by 14 year olds? Why is it so painful to pilot an Eva? What happens to you when you do? What is it about the Children that makes them the only people who can pilot the Evas? What is the nature of the relationship between each Eva and its pilot? What was the first Impact? Come to think of it, what was the second impact? What was the deal with Misato's father? Fuck you, you don't get to know.\nThat leaves theme as the last element that could possibly draw an audience into this series. Unfortunately, the \"dark, heady, psychological\" thematic content is based on Freudian psychology, which is a bunch of misogynist, homophobic, misleading, and scientifically-debunked hogwash. Literally the only place Freud is taken seriously in modern academia is in English departments, and even there with a grain of salt. \nI will admit that the thematic aspects are a matter of taste in an attempt to be fair, but regardless, their execution leaves much to be desired. Evangelion disrespects its viewers by posing questions and leaving the audience to make shit up if they want closure and by deliberately attempting to confuse its viewers. The writers essentially led their audience on a wild goose chase, flip-flopping throughout the writing process before deciding fuck everything in the name of artistic liberty. There's nothing inherently wrong with convoluted story-telling, open endings, or keeping your viewers in the dark about information, but there is a balance to be found between alienating your audience and challenging them. Evangelion falls on the wrong side. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n                          \n     How does one become a true hero? Does one eat a magical fruit and embark on a quest for gold and glory? Does one make a contract for power as a means to get revenge? Or does one use the powers of the undead to shape the world in a way he sees fit? No, the only way to become a true hero is to face one's insecurities, build courage, face reality, and do one's duty, regardless of the trials that may be just on the horizon.\n...and what would be really great is if Neon Genesis Evangelion had a hero like that.\nBefore going to\n          \n        the review, I'd like to give some thoughts after just finishing this series. First of all, Neon Genesis Evangelion is certainly worth the watch. In fact, I think any fan of anime should watch it. It is something special, particularly in that it is an excellent deconstruction of the mecha genre. The impact that Evangelion has made on both the genre and anime itself is very apparent.\nGoing into the story, I would like to say that Evangelion exceeded my expectations. What I thought was going to be as simple as battling aliens with robots turned out to go into things like government, people, the human psyche, emotions, and family. Also, the initial execution of story was fantastic. I foresaw a clear path that would lead to a perfect end. However, the well-executed beginning of Evangelion did not manage to trickle down to the end.\nFirstly, I will discuss the plot. Monsters known as angels, of which caused a cataclysmic event in the year 2000, have returned in the year 2015. Mankind must use weapons called Evangelions in order to save themselves. And the people that must pilot these weapons turn out to be 14-year-old children! Yes, our main protagonist is Shinji, the child of the commander of NERV. Shinji is not a bad character. In fact, all of the characters are fantastic! Unfortunately, the way the plot moves hinders our cast, especially Shinji. \nNow, Shinji is not that groundbreaking as far as characters go. He is insecure, shy, unconfident and lonely. Some if this stems from his mother dying and his father abandoning him at a young age. He fears depending on people and having people depend on him. Suddenly, he is forced to face his weaknesses, as the fate of mankind may very well rest on his shoulders. Naturally, you would think that the story would lead to Shinji developing the courage and strength that he needs. The thing is, this never happens.\nEveryone in the main cast has their own weaknesses and insecurities. This could be jealousy, lack of self-purpose, or scars from past relationships. And what Evangelion does is take the characters' weaknesses and just slowly grind the characters into dust. My favorite character from the show, Asuka, started out as a strong-willed and competitive young woman. However, as she performed less adequately and her peers improved, this consistently led her to jealousy, depression, and finally to her completely alienating herself from others. As likable as the characters are, Evangelion denies them a climatic point of resolution, a point where they can accept their insecurities and then strive to overcome them. From what I hear, the writer of Evangelion was severely depressed as the show went on, which is reflected by the direction of the show. This is, what I would call, a total drag.  \nIn all truth, the vast majority of Evangelion is fantastic. Remember, where the story fails is its lack of resolution. Watching the journeys of our characters is a very pleasant experience. You will probably think the same thing after you have personally felt what the characters on screen have felt.\nAbout the visuals, it’s not so simple as whether they are good or bad. Evangelion was plagued with a low budget, which is apparent in scenes with lack of movement. Evangelion also likes to skimp by with characters' mouths being hidden behind things. Sometimes, whoever is talking isn't even shown on the screen. And then, you have these intense action sequences where everything is moving all at once, and you are utterly encapsulated by what's happening on the screen. If you are willing to forgive the time period in which Evangelion was made, as well as its small budget, you shouldn't have any problems. Also, the sound and music of Evangelion is great. There are very good themes that help pump up action sequences with energy.\nOne more thing: at the time of writing this review, I have not seen the movie End of Evangelion. I hear it makes up for the unsatisfying conclusion of the series. However, this is not a review of the movie. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Edit\nI freaking hate End of Evangelion, but the series is still good. Just wanted to throw that in there.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is a fantastic, ground-breaking anime that is plagued by lack of resolution, both in the story and in characters. This anime has my full recommendation, as it is too important to ignore. Please check it out if you have not, as it is certainly an anime worth experiencing."},

The creation of such an anime is controversial people who love it will love it because they are its target audience, it does not appeal to all audiences and thats why its so amazing, the director made a point of bravely targeting a specific group of people but still left enough room for people who are not in its target audience to bash on\n          \n        it. which ultimately is its downfall. \nyou should watch neon genesis evangelion if you have been down on your luck your entire life and need some solutions to your life problems. you have been so desperatley drowing yourself in anime and distractions to avoid getting hurt by people.\n        "},

Even though it came out just over a decade ago, its fan base is still as strong as ever, especially with the Rebuild of Evangelion airing just a while back in Japanese theatres.\nGenuinely shocking moments, a complex plot, and one of the best examples of characterisation and expression make this a timeless classic. I&rsquo;ve watched every episode at least 10 times, and I still can&rsquo;t get bored with it. Even with this anime being a decade old, the animation is still quite impressive, even if it&rsquo;s not on par with some of the more recent anime. The voice acting\n          \n        (sub, not the dub ) is brilliant too. I still can hear Shinji&rsquo;s maniacal screams ringing in my head. And not to worry, the series still has plenty of mecha action.\nIn short, this anime is a must watch for any anime fan. Some will like it, some will hate it, but its hard to disagree that this is one of the most stirring pieces of animation you'll ever watch. \n        "},

Is your answer Yes? If so, continue on...\nEvangelion is a \"love it or hate it\" anime and since I saw it when I was a child I was enthralled with the \"giant robot fights\" it wasn't too long ago I decided I unearth the gem that is NGE and watch it again for those giant robot fights. And boy was I surprised, if you're picking up NGE for the first time or are like me and are picking it up after remembering it vaguely\n          \n        as that cool mecha anime you saw as a child - you couldn't be more wrong.\nNGE is so much more than just a mecha anime, and your first time through it the chances are you won't understand more than half of what's going on unless you watch multiple YouTube / Convention analysis of the characters and story, but don't let that scare you off. You don't even need to understand it all to enjoy Eva. \nIf you go into this anime reminding yourself, \"this was released in 1995\" and treat it as such, you will not be disappointed. \nThe hardest part to overcome in this anime is the main character, Shinji Ikari. He is going through so many psychological issues I can't even suggest therapy for the kid. He comes off as whiny / emo / etc. If you deal with people like him in real life, it isn't such a hard thing to overcome, but if these kind of characters annoy you, you may want to look into the psycho-analysis of him before writing him off, if you still can't get by his persona - try watching Rebuild of Evangelion, he's a bit of a different character there, but the story might be a bit more convoluted. \nAs much as I talk NGE up (10's across the board except in art), there are some moments that are questionable. A few scenes might linger for up to a minute without movement and the ending is just...special (yeah that's why art isn't a 10...), well you'll see if you make it there. \n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    ----------------------------MILD SPOILERS-----------------------------------------\nWelcome to my anime review of Neon Genesis Evangelion, where I list the good, the bad, and the questionable things I found in the anime.  Ah, who am I kidding, Neon Genesis Evangelion was only bad, bad, and bad.\nIn our great anime community, the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion has been known to have extremely polarized views.  There are those that praise it as the greatest masterpiece, and there are those that think its nuclear waste.  If you don't know by know from my previous statements and my overall score, I am the latter.\nI stumbled upon this abortion of an anime when\n          \n        I first started watching anime.  I had just finished watching Code Geass, and was looking for something else to watch.  That was when my brother recommended to me Neon Genesis Evangelion, saying that people have given it very good ratings even though he had not watched it himself yet.  So, trusting that his information was accurate, I decided to give it a try.  \nWorst mistake of my life.  \nWithin the first 3 episodes of the show, I began to hate the main character, and that hate only continued to grow as the show went on.  The whole show can be summarized into one sentence:  Shinji, stop being a pussy.\nThe only good part I found within the anime was in the very middle when they were fighting monsters known as Angels and the plot was seemingly speeding up.  That was when the psychological crap started.\nThe last three episodes of the show was all about the two main characters trying to fight their inner demons, learning to accept themselves, blah blah blah.  I didn't really care much about it, but I decided to sit through it because I wanted to see how the anime ended since they still had 3 or so Angels to defeat.\nBut then the anime ended after the main character accepted himself.  I stared at the screen in disbelief as I tried to look for the next episode.  So, I looked online and found that they had made a movie continuation to finish the series, which was probably after people rioted in Japan after watching the original ending.\nBut oh god the movie was even worse.  The ending of the show made absolutely zero sense.  Even my brother, who had read the summary of the show, was confused.  Those that say, \"oh we're not actually supposed to get this because the things going on in the anime were done by beings from another world\".  But, remember, this was written by a HUMAN BEING.  So basically what you are saying is \"the author ran out of ideas so he started spewing bullshit in order to wrap it up\".\nNow, should you watch this anime?  Luckily for you, I have made a list of questions for you to see whether or not you should watch this anime.\n1. Is this going to be your first anime?\nIf you answered yes, then what I'm wondering right now is what kind of twisted demon recommended this anime to you.\n2. Is this not your first anime?\nIf you answered yes, then what possessed you to even consider watching this?\n3. Do you have matches, gasoline, or a lighter in your house?\nIf you answered yes, then do not watch this anime because you will have strong urges to start lighting stuff on fire.\nIf you answered no, then do not watch this anime because you will run to the nearest store to get some matches and gasoline.\nDespite all the bashing I've done on this anime, I do have to thank it for one thing.  Neon Genesis Evangelion was such a stark contrast in quality to Code Geass that it most likely destroyed the part of my brain that could differentiate between quality and trash.  As a result, I am now able to watch many more shows than I would have otherwise.  My brother did not watch this anime, and therefore has started running out of anime to watch.  \nSo if you want to expand the number of anime you can watch, then by all means watch Neon Genesis Evangelion.  However, if you want to keep your sanity, stay away at all costs.\n        "},

As Arnold Schwarzenegger says in Terminator 2 I will be back and im back! Reading book and watching movies has taught me much of The World (jojo), namely how much more art exists outside of animation… and how much better it can be. Although many book and film exist few are as good as Neon Genesis Evangelion. The thing I hate most about Eva (as I will be calling it) is that every person\n          \n        who talks about it says the same things, to the point of copying the wording and language. Some of these reviews and analisis could would get anime critics kicked out of university for copyright infringement and plagiarism. It’s all “anno was depressed” this and “be an individual that” we’ve heard it all before. \nWhere Genesis really shows off is with how its story is a direct allegory to the Odyssey by Homer. Just as Odysseus must overcome obstacles set in his path to return home, Shinji Ikari must get in the robot and overcome 12 celestial beings to return to his normal life. What Shinji doesn’t comprehend is that the monster are reflections of his own Freudian psychotic state and insecurities as an abused adolescent who doesn’t know where to go or who to be. This subtle allegory is something most anime fans would not notice as Hidiaki Anno was a big fan of books and the films of Andrei Tarkovsky just like me. \nWhat Shinseiki Evangelionreally espouses is the power of human will and spirit, it’s a celebration of our powerful race and its ability to overcome all, internal or external. At the end Shinji chooses to reject instrumentality and embrace free will and choice. Anno rejects the postermodern idea that we are all slaves to our environment and suggests that humans are autonomous beings capable of change and choice. It’s weird to me how many SJWs seems to love Shinji for being a p*ssy although in the end he debunks the core of feminism, post modernism, and other leftist foundational ideas. Love it or hate it the statement EVA makes is reactionary, just goes to show how dumb they are. \nAll in all新世紀エヴァンゲリオン is an art piece that transcends its medium and will be remembered for generations to come. My only hope is that is cemented for the right reasons and not because of some dumb buzzwords elitists make up to make them feel smart and good about themselves. \nMoral of the lesson, if you like eva, lain, texh… these kinds of animes. You’re not really smart, quit  posturing and pick up a book. Start with the greeks and work your way up, kids. "},

Imma watch this shit\", and so I did, and before I go on in more details about this journey; I have to let you know that mecha, sci-fi and this type of Anime genres are not my specialty and even though I have not watched enough of it as a whole, compared to the amount I’ve read, I was able to enjoy it greatly. And yes, I do rate my things based on enjoyment purely.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion starts off introducing Ikari Shinji, our\n          \n        main character, troubled by the abandonment of his father throughout his life only to be, suddenly, summoned the same man to help save humanity, by piloting one of his inventions, the so called Evangelion (\"Eva\" for short), something that, for some reason, can only be done by Shinji, his first instinct is to deny anything his faulty father may ask of him but for a few reasons,  mainly the girl that pilots the other Eva that intrigues him enough to stay and help.\nNow this is as far as I’ll go in talking about what happens in the show cause I don’t really remember how much I knew when I started and I don’t wanna spoil anything to anyone. but I will say that this show surprised me in the best way possible, I went in thinking it would be an action filled, fast paced anime and what I found was, yes all that, but a lot deep, existential questioning that I did not expect, the characters begin their own story in such a cliché way but the more you know the more you care and root for them, and greed to know more.\nActually that was my sentiment throughout the 26 episodes, greed, the more they revealed, the more I needed to know. The bad side's that by the end of it I had more questions than answers, due to that I’m rating it a 9. So I guess I wouldn’t recommend it for someone that needs something very straight lined, predictable and simple. \nSaying that, if you want to watch something different, intriguing and above all, a classic you should really give Neon Genesis Evangelion a try. Now if you'll excuse me I’m headed to the movie sequel \"The End of Evangelion\" which I came to understand will answer some of my so-called questions, hopefully."},

Damn i don't really do not know what to think.\nIt is impressive to be sure...especially for something that came out over 20 years ago. but the sheer amount of controversial messages and images within it are just Wow...no wonder this has so much infamous even after all this time that has passed i can see what it is a must see for any anime fan. \nHowever that does not mean it is perfect especially production wise...the last few episodes of the tv series are so... mismatched to say the least...u can practically skip the\n          \n        last two and go for the movie which is the real ending..and than the story there is still so much questions to be asked and few gaps that needed to be answered.\nSure it may have been intention to force you the viewer to make your own interpretation but they could have given us a bit more information about the whole thing. So bottom line i would give the Tv series 8/10 and the movie a 9/10\nAs for the New Evangelion movies which are reboot as well as going further past the story where the original conclusion ended...i have yet to watch them for the following reasons:\n1: I need some time to absorb what i just saw in the original series so that way when i watch the new movies i will be able to make a good comparison between the two.\n2: it would be to much trouble to watch them after this..as i would feel like i am repeating myself again...not good when u just watching the first..so i need some time so when i watch it ..i wont be so fatigued and enjoy them more.\n3. it is not concluded.....i rather wait for the last movie (good god whenever that will be released) so i can watch it all in one go..and won't be just stuck in a cliffhanger...i guess i can count my fortunes i waited this long to watch the original so i did not have to suffer the long wait in gaps between the releases... a little cruel for those who have been waiting longer but it is a fact so it can't be helped sorry guys.\nBottom line: I think you really should watch NGE if u have not yet ..especially for it's controversial themes as well as it's lasting cultural impact it made for the anime community in general...as well as if u are a Mech fan but that much has been said already XD.\n        "},

There is also the fact that it was my first anime and therefore I got more easily confused than I am now at NGE's mode of presentation and storytelling. I would not, incidentally, recommend this as anyone's first anime under any circumstances. Love it or hate it I think most people would agree with me on that. I started off loving it, only for the ending to put me off anime for a few years. Since I\n          \n        can separate what I like from what I hate quite easily I'll split the review up in that way.\nLove: The artwork here is gorgeous. Given the limitations of their budget they did a fantastic job, from the Evas to the character designs. My one caveat is the angels: I didn't really like them. But that isn't enough to keep me from appreciating the visual splendor on display. Also brilliant is the music. The opening title is one of my all time favorites and throughout the series there are wonderful themes that add greatly to the drama. I have several tracks permanently on my iPhone and listen to them often. Plotwise, the basic story has been done to death, from high-schoolers as the leads to the mechs being built to fight monsters destroying humanity, but I was lucky in that this was the first time I saw it and thus the cliche seemed new and fresh. Since this series created many of these cliches it seems only fair to give it a pass on them. It revolves largely around a monster of the week approach, although they do have a number of overarching themes. The plot really feels like it's advancing so you feel quite drawn to the struggles of the leads. It also features a lot of emotional soul-searching and character development. This was something genuinely new to anime, and is why this was one of the most influential animes of all time. The series does quite a good job of setting up the drama and danger and makes it very clear how important for the survival of the species this mission is. Which leads right into the problems.\nHate: I think that everyone can agree the ending sucked. A big part of the reason the show kept me hooked was because I wanted to know the answers to the many mysteries it set up. What were the Angels? Why were they named that? Why were the computers running the Evas named after the Magi? What was with all the Christian symbolism? What was Gendo's goal in all this? Well, you never find these out. The movie explains some of this, but to say that the answers it gave were unsatisfactory is rather an understatement. I naively assumed that this series was doing things for a reason, and when it turned out to be going nowhere I turned harshly against a series that I had previously been enjoying. Watching it again knowing that these questions wouldn't be answered I realized how pretentious it all is. Why throw in all this (often obscure) Christian symbolism if it doesn't mean anything? The major complaint shared by everyone is the characters. Shinji is a whiny brat, and kind of a wuss. Fans who point out that he is in fact an accurate depiction of an abused child are missing the point. This is a form of entertainment, not a documentary. Nobody wants to listen to someone whine about how bad their life is for hours on end (wah! my dad built me a mech and surrounded me with beautiful girls. wah!). Having an unsympathetic character is fine but they have to either be surrounded by better ones or improves. The series relies and focuses on the whiner FAR too much. People who like to go on about realism should note that there is in fact no way that people with such severe emotional flaws would ever be put in positions of such power. I put up with Shinji entirely in the hope that he would get better, and he does, only to collapse back in on himself again. The other characters aren't as bad, although his father Gendo is the worst combination of stereotypically distant Japanese father and incomprehensible supervillain. He does however have the best glasses in the entire world. The final few episodes were really bad, although here I'm giving the series a pass since I know it was budget constraints more than anything else. We get one obviously major character showing up, developing an instant bff relationship, and then vanishing an episode later. The last two episodes are told almost entirely in stills since they ran out of budget to animate anything. But even here, it is obvious that the series didn't have a plan of where it was going. It was relying on faith that it would get somewhere interesting and it didn't arrive there.\nI don't want this to be a 5. Five implies mediocre, and Evangelion is never that. But since there is no way that I can provide a score that is both 1 and 10 there's nothing I can do but average them together. And when you do that it comes out completely average. The series is one that should be seen if only because of all that it inspired, but be prepared going in for an unsatisfying conclusion and some seriously annoying characters.\n        "},

Hideaki Anno effectively paints a picture of a world on the brink of destruction at the hands of forces completely beyond mortal ken. \nLet me get one thing clear: this is not a FUN anime.  This is not an action-packed romp through a mechanical rogues gallery that ends with our magical boy hero getting the girl and saving the universe. This series is a slow descent into madness, designed to put the viewer in the shoes of someone suffering\n          \n        from crippling depression, social anxiety, and an inferiority complex. None of the characters are supposed to be likable - they're each based on different reactions to clinical depression.\nAll that aside, it is a deeply rewarding watch. It contains hundreds of little points for tangential learning, especially on the topics of recent Japanese history (sarin gas attacks) and Judeo-Christian mysticism (tree of sephiroth). It contains some shockingly imaginative designs for both the Evas and Angels. It features the single catchiest opening theme in the history of ever.\nIf you ever watched and enjoyed the work of western directors like Lars Von Trier, you might want to give NGE a shot.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    I was never into mecha anime all that much until I saw the Vision of Escaflowne, an anime that works rather well as a gateway into the genre. Neon Genesis Evangelion was always one anime of the genre that piqued my interest due to the characters and the thematic story.\nAnd the story is very nice; an interesting world setting that manages to mould the character's backstories and development rather well. Shinji himself is relatable and the other characters, whilst almost cookie-cutter like in their personalities, manage to be all captivating in their own way.\nThe Eva fights are thrilling and very dangerous, the character's in the\n          \n        mechas are always in danger and they manage to have a tonne of moments that will have you at the edge of your seat. They are all visually dazzling and very fun to watch.\nOne thing I certainly appreciated is the show's use of humour, there's not a whole lot but comic relief manages to keep your spirits up especially due to the hostile and bleak nature of the world after the Second Impact, along with the Angel threat. I was surprised to see that many scenes were set in school, which I had no idea about. The show balances the dynamic of Shinji having to battle Angels and put up with school at the same time; it works rather well. Even the religious imagery, whilst pointless in the long run, does supply some depth and are visually striking.\nAnd I have to say that unfortunately the anime does have a steep downside. I would easily rank the first 15 episodes as being a 9, or possibly even 10/10. They're somehow still fresh, they're dark and mature without being overwhelming, the setting and characters are nice, the music is great, the fights are fun and perilous, and the show is paced well.\nMany people, including die hard fans criticize the final two episodes for being confusing and extremely different from the rest of the show; but I feel that the problems stem from episode 16.\nEpisode 16 is the first episode that really began to drag on and on. Very few episodes after this point feel like they have a definite beginning and end. They open somewhere; sometimes to bring in a plot device or story element out of nowhere, and after twenty minutes the closing credits begin to play. These episodes are noticeably darker in tone, which is really saying something, and whilst mecha fights do still exist at this point they aren't as plentiful and are very slow. But then the show only falls more and more by the episode. Evangelion slowly drops all humour, drops the entire school setting, and you will be lucky to see any mecha fights; there are so few after episode 16 its almost like a cruel joke. To put it simply, the final Angel confrontation in the series is NOT a mecha fight.\nThe final 10 episodes shift from post apocalyptic action into psychological drama, and not only does it feel out of its depth, but it feels so hamfisted and jarring. All the episodes dragged on for various reasons and were simply depressing and boring all due to the confusing cuts and lack of clarity as to where characters are and the (sometimes) lack of animation altogether; it gives the final episodes a very boxed in and dreamlike quality where you're not quite sure what is happening is really happening. Two characters late on are revealed to be shot dead; but due to the editing and such I was confused and still aren't sure if that was a dream sequence, wondering if what happened did indeed happen.\nSo few answers to questions brought up aren't actually addressed, and if they are they're incredibly vague to the point of raising even more questions than the ones initially asked. \nAnd of course episode 25-26 are where you're really in the deep end.\nAs poor as the final two episodes are, I feel since I prepared for them, I knew mostly what to expect. I never heard a peep from anyone about the 8 running upto the final 2; which certainly took me by surprise and impaired my enjoyment.\nBut I'm sure if you've heard of Evangelion you've most likely heard of the terrible ending that's confusing, makes no sense and contains zero closure, so I won't flog a dead horse.\nIn conclusion I'm not sure if I can recommend Evangelion. The first half is so good and so fun/enjoyable and definitely worth its status but does it matter how good the first 15 episodes are when the remaining 10 are absolutely dire and depressing?\nWe aren't talking about two separate seasons or a sequel series, this is one full arc that is intended to come full circle. Not like GT to Dragon Ball Z. Because it's all one long running plot, that means that I can't recommend the first 15 episodes and then advise to stop there, because even if you read up on the internet about the answers you'll get the same effect as watching. So either way you're destined to be disappointed and baffled by this show. I just can't fathom how this show is so popular when it took a deep dive, the first 15 episodes are near masterpieces but they're sunk by whatever the hell 16-26 are.\nEvangelion really is the anime equivalent of Marmite. People fall into two camps since either you absolutely love it or absolute hate it. But I'm right in the middle in that I love the first 15 but hate the second half.\nWhen I finished the series I felt sad, angry, and just plain disappointed. I was so ready to call myself an Evangelion fan, but as it stands, I can't.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    After hearing endless praise for the series and its so proclaimed realistic and believeable characters I decided to give it a shot but man wasn't this a big letdown. There seems to be a so called trend in anime series that when an anime contains or touches upon the dark aspects of the human nature its automatically symbolic, deep bla bla with no exception of shows like elfen lied , akame ga kill etc etc.\nStory:\nHumanity on the brink of extinction, Life of a young boy completely changed as goes on the mission to save the world bla bla bla. The story isn't really a great\n          \n        but not bad in the slightest. \nArt: \nFor a show made in 1995 the animation is pretty good and smooth and possibly the best aspect of the show.\nSound: \nI never really pay that much attention to the sound but its generally good, nothing really stood out to me but it isn't bad either. But I really love opening and the song “A Cruel Angel Thesis”.\nCharacters:\nThis is easily the worst part of the show and the sole reason I was never really able to enjoy NGE.\nShinji Ikari - Holy fucking shit where the hell do I even start. If you have heard about NGE you might have also heard about the realistic characters and Shinji the so called \"Most Realistic Character\" but couldn't that be more wrong.\nAfter being abandoned by his father when he was just a child and constantly suffering through adverse situations he finally decides to run away from almost everything to avoid getting even more hurt. Being a depressed suicidal cunt myself who spends half of his day listening to music, watching anime and surfing through the net (remove the internet and my day is almost similar to that of Shinji expect that I don’t pilot an eva and my dad ain’t a cunt either). So I initially thought Shinji might be the most relatable character I will ever find but I couldn't have been more wrong .For someone who was abandoned by his father and was constantly suffering Shinji couldn’t have been more immature, (not trying to sound like some old man) pain and suffering may fuck us over but at some point we learn from those situations and become a more rational and mature person but I can’t see any of this in Shinji. \nThough the most baffling and absurd thing would be when nerv used the dummy plug system. After Shinji refusing to kill the angel (which was originally an eva and still has a person inside it) nerv uses dummy plug to destroy the angel so that it doesn’t destroy them and fucking massacre them all this is still somehow too cruel for Shinji and since one of his friends gets seriously injured due to this he loses his mind and decides to destroy nerv himself.  So let me go over it again nerv killing an angel who may easily slaughter them all and all of the Japan along with them is too cruel cause someone is  still inside  and may die cause of it and since those bastards still killed the angels (while saving themselves and countless other lives) but cause his friend is now in critical condition our lord and savior Shinji will destroy nerv himself.\nWhat little development he gets goes is all lost since he goes brain dead (incase if he had one to begin with) after the death of the last angel. Even after all said and done I could still understand his action from an objective point of view to some extent but we just need him to sulk, cry, act depressed even more to degrade his character even further with the movie. After jerking off to Asuka’s naked body who is still in a fatigued state Shinji goes emo again and just keeps sitting in a corner while nerv is getting fucked inside out by the military. What worsens this even more is the fact that this shitbag who lost his over one of his friend getting almost killed is just sulking over when everyone is getting slaughtered and is still refusing to fight back. *slow clap* LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS IS OUR MOST BELIEVEABLE CHARACTER.\nEnjoyment:\nI was enjoying this anime but the forced self pity and sympathy for Shinji really brought it down.\nThings I’d like to say:\n1.	This is nowhere near to an objective opinion, hell I can’t even say that it is subjective at this point cause I just wrote this to blow of some steam so clam your tits.\n2.	If you haven't realized it yet this isn’t even a review but just me ranting a bit on Shinji as this shitbag really pissed me off but tbh I don’t really think I hate him as much as you may feel after reading this cause I just wrote this in the heat of the moment.\n3.	I probably won’t agree with almost half of the what I wrote above but the reason I’m still posting it is just to calm my tits. \n4.	If you life Shinji as a character or heck even if he is your favorite character don’t let this bother you cause who am I or for that matter anyone else in the world to object to your taste.\n5.	Lastly, Shinji is an asshole."},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Evangelion sure is a well known and widely accepted work.  I honestly don't why it's so well liked though because so many things in the anime are just stupid.  I'm not yelling at people who like it, but I'll mention most of the problems I  found.\nThe first problem is the story.  Humans fighting aliens with mechanical suits is nothing new and it was honestly quite boring to watch.  It might have been a little less boring if the suits had better designs.  The biggest problem though, is that so many so called \"deep\" philosophical ideas are thrown into the\n          \n        anime and a lot of them seemed liked they are forced into the story.  Many of these themes could be picked out with a little bit of analysis, but it really took away from the story by throwing all these \"deep\" meanings in constantly.  The final two episodes pretty much exist to explain the meaning of self worth and whatnot for Shinji and give some background for Rei and Asuka as well as to show them gaining some understanding of the self.  I really feel like these two episodes didn't really add anything all that important though as most the idea behind this theme should pretty easily be picked out from previous episodes.  I'll give the story a 3 since it is extremely boring and too bogged down with philosophical ideas, some forced and others that seem non-existent without going too deep into analysis.  It's not the worst I've seen though.\nThe art actually is bad even for a 1997 work and the backgrounds are not at all special.  There is way too many still shots  for no good reason and the eva designs are not good or cool looking in the slightest, they're just dreadful; they look like poorly mutated beats rather than robots with a good design.  Most of the characters just look completely awful and totally unappealing to the eye to boot.   A 3.5/10 for this category.\nNow, I do feel like the sound is really bad even for an early work.  The opening theme is not good, but I guess it's ok for the show.  Also, the rest of the music just seemed like general scores used for old anime, and they don't do a very good job at pumping you up for the fights or major arguments. A lot of it is just random  music that is represents sounds from the outdoors or whatever used during still shots outside  I'll give the sound a 3/10.\nIt's time to discuss the characters now.  I'd say the character part is the worst aspect of Evangelion.  A lot of people like to say that Rei, Shinji, and Asuka set the stage for their archetypes, but even if this is true, most of them do an extremely poor job at it.  Take Shinji.  He's just a whinny kid who doesn't let known a lot of what he's thinking, he complains about piloting Evangelion unit 1 for most of the first half, he does most of what he does just because he's afraid of people hating him, and he's almost always doubting himself.  He's the worst case of a self insert/plot device character I've ever seen and  he becomes cocky from the slightest bit of praise.  Now, Rei and Misato are actually decent characters and i like their personalities, backstories, and mysteries surrounding them.  Than there is Asuka, who's just a bitch.  That's basically all she is.  She's so cocky about her abilities and just wants to show them off even if it entails disregarding protocol and gets others involved in dangerous life threatening situations brought about by her arrogance. She pretty much treats everyone like shit besides for the class representative.  Asuka literally almost gets Shinji killed within like 10 minutes of being introduced because she was arrogant; I'm not saying Shinji dying wouldn't have been a plus, but it would've had an equally negative effect on  Asuka's character.  Of course there's more horrible characters like Gendo Ikari and others, but there's no sense mentioning them since I don't have anything that good to say anyway.  Overall,  Shinji and Asuka are the worst characters of their archetypes that I've seen, many side characters are horrible people too, and Rei and Misato are really the only redeeming characters and there presence is keeping my character score at a 1/10 instead of a .5 or 0.  I know people generally like these characters, but it's a perfect case of when being complicated doesn't make them not awful in every way.\nIt's obvious that I didn't enjoy Neon Genesis Evangelion much.  One of my final thoughts will be that forcing \"deep\" philosophical and psychological meanings and ideas into an anime ,like they do in Eva, degrades its quality rather improving it.  It's good to give viewers something to think about, but don't force it into your work and or make deep meanings that don't really fully exist in the anime.  Also, considering that figuring out what makes up the \"self\" seems to be a big part of this anime, the last 2 episodes show how simple the show really is;  if an idea/concept that the show is exploring can be summarized in 2 episodes when it originally took 24 episodes to get there, the idea is not as complicated to figure out as the work tries to make it; figuring out the idea of self is usually deep, but not the way it presented here.   I''ll give my enjoyment a 2 and give an overall score of a 2.5/10.  I do not recommend this.  I know I mention this in all of my reviews so far for pre-2000 anime, but this is just another example of a bad anime from that time period that gets \"pre-2000 classic protection\".  I know I've only seen a few anime from back than, but my experiences have been horrible.  Hopefully, I'll find that one good one.\n        "},

Is it really?\nStory:\nEvangelion is a mecha anime on the surface, but early on we get the feeling, that there is more to this than just robot action. After the first half, which is still within the boundaries of the genre, the show starts morphing more and more into a psychological drama. In the last two episodes (and I don’t think I’m spoilering much here) NGE throws all conventions out the window and becomes a piece of art. This doesn’t sound so bad, but that means that the viewer gets no\n          \n        conclusion whatsoever. If you stopped watching after 24 episodes, you would know just as much about Evangelion as if you’d watched its final. I appreciate the artistic approach, but seriously, you have to give us SOMETHING.\n8/10\nArt:\nAs far as I know, the production struggled financially, so some parts of the animation are…let’s say lackluster. The scenes featuring the Eva units as well as the final episodes look really, really good, but the character design and the use of freeze images don’t look too good to me. This has been interpreted as some kind of artistic technique, but we all know that’s not true.\n6/10\nSound:\nThe opening is a classic, but this is more due to being the opening of Evangelion than being incredible on its own. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not bad at all, but it also isn’t a masterpiece. The ending however is interesting. Fly Me To The Moon is played in multiple different versions, which gives off a weird vibe (besides the fact that I like the Sinatra version a lot). The music used in the anime itself is what’s really great. There is few of it, but when It is used, it takes the scenes to a whole new level. The voice acting is okay, nothing spectacular but satisfying. Asukas voice gets annoying after a while, but that may just be me.\n9/10\nCharacters:\nThis is the strongest point of Evangelion by far. Today, characters with a dark and troubled past are a dead horse, but back in the 90s they weren’t everywhere. NGE has a cast filled with nothing but these kind of characters, which steer the whole thing from beginning to finish. We get to see everybody’s inner abyss and their mental problems makes them do what they do, be it right or wrong. As a psychoanalysis, Evangelion is simply fantastic. There are no true good or bad characters, be it the chosen children, the NERV personnel or the angels. I just would’ve liked to see what happened to them (yes, I know it is shown in other Evangelion animations, but I am purely talking about the series here).\n10/10\nEnjoyment:\nIf you know what you’re getting yourself into (and it is pretty much impossible nowadays to not), you will get exactly what you anticipated. This is a psychotic mess in the best way possible, so if you’re into that kind of stuff, this is your anime. The one major downside the series has is the missing ending. If you’re looking for conclusion, you’re better off not watching the final 2 episodes but End of Evangelion instead (for example). Besides that disappointment I felt very entertained and I at least enjoyed the art of the ending if nothing else.\n9/10\nOverall:\n8.4/10\n        "},

First of all, the animation in the show fluctuates from Michelangelo's best works to retarded children with colouring pencils. Don't get me started on the \"riveting\" scenes like that one scene in episode 4 in which one of the characters is waiting for an other character in a train station and almost NOTHING happens for minuets. But all things considered, Neon Genesis Evangelion manages to be a masterpiece. As a matter of fact i think it is one of if not the best anime ever made. I have lots of subjective and objective reasons\n          \n        to support my bold claim, but before i start giving out reasons why this anime from 1995(it's older than most of the people reading this review) is so good, keep the following things in mind. 1st NGE has a tendency of answering your questions in ways that more often than not end up raising the amount of questions you originally had, but the answers are there, just hidden below all the screaming 14 year old japanese boys...A better way of explaining it will be that NGE will give answers to your questions on a piece of paper and then rub off the answers and then hand that paper back to you. NGE is perfect but not in the conventional sense. My definition of the word \"perfect\" doesn't mean something that's having no flaws but is something that leaves in impact on the viewer and its respective industry, and no matter what any may say about Evangelion, they can't deny Evangelion's influence on the anime industry. Now then I'll assume that you've read the plot synopsis of NGE. You'll see the story unfold from the perspective of Shinji Ikari. He has his own personal problems that he has to deal with in the show. His problems become an important plot point of the show. Well, Shinji ain't the only one with personal problems, pretty much every named character in the show has problems that become quite apparent in the 26 episodes(+ 1 movie) that the show has. The viewer can relate to the characters in this show to a very deep personal level(they connected with me). If you do relate to them then you need a hug *hugs*. The characters are Evangelion's strongest point. They may seem sane at first but trust me, they're all equally messed up in their own special ways. Eva is a mecha 2nd and a deep character study 1st. The music for Eva fits the show perfectly(it's done by the same guy who did the music for Bleach). I won't even start off on the shows opening and ending songs. The dub is a tricky s.o.b. It isn't gonna convert dub haters that's for sure but it like the show is special(espically if you search up some info on it)(when you're done with the show, go to YouTube and watch \"Shinji's rant\") I want to talk about the shows ending but if i start i ain't gonna stop writing for awhile. \nIn conclusion, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a deconstruction of the mech genre, a psychological character study, ominous as hell and most of all shit(you'll get the joke when you watch the show). Neon Genesis Evangelion is a masterpiece. I would've written more but i think I'll stop now. If you haven't seen Eva till now, go watch it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    The ending pissed me off so much (no spoilers)-\nSTORY- 7/10\nMostly good until the ending. where everything went to hell because of empty pockets and Shinji started talking to himself. But there's also the End of Evangelion Movie, so looking forward to watch that. The concept of the Angels and their mysteriousness was interesting, the whole mystery aspect behind why they're attacking and all, but a lot of questions are unanswered. \nART- 8/10\nFor the low budget and 90's animation, Evangelion did a good job with its animation. Nice bright scenery to contrast to the themes of the show, and the animation for the show was good\n          \n        when it tried. Unfortunately, the budget cuts really vamped the quality down. Episode 24 featured Shinji inside his robot staring for half a minute, so points off there.\nSOUND- 7/10\nThe soundtrack wasn't that noteworthy for the most part, with some exceptions. The opening, A Cruel Angel's Thesis, is currently my favorite opening of all time (and yes, I've watched AoT, TG, F/Z, SAO), with the catchy tune and inspiring lyrics really fitting for the show. But the last few episodes,  LOL HAHAHA. When one of the Angels attack and destroying stuff, they legitimately start playing Ode to Joy while NERV and its pilots are having their necks hung dry, and then later on towards Episode 24 when Shinji's having a bit of a breakdown and staring for half a minute. So great job Gainax for trying your best, but that just didn't work well.\nCHARACTER- 9/10\nSo nowadays, people bash on mainstream anime mostly because lack of character development. Evangelion is probably the exact opposite. It's a character study over the Evangelion pilots and the other cast. People have mixed reviews over Shinji's personality, mostly because they hate him. I don't hate Shinji that much, and he definitely displays some personality traits that make him a better character than maybe Natsu from Fairy Tail, but it doesn't stop the fact that he's a really annoying character at times. Rei's pretty mysterious and her character has been copied and pasted into other anime, and Asuka is alright too, with a sort of messed up childhood. So Evangelion did well in this department.\nENJOYMENT- 7/10\nSo I'm not a real fan of mecha anime, or the 90's animation, so this score isn't going to be fantastic. The fights against the Angels and how they affect the characters are really interesting to see, but I don't like to interpret anime too much (since it's a bunch of silly Japanese cartoons, right?), and Evangelion really made me think. The ending was also a point of annoyance for me, and that's why I'm watching End of Evangelion right after this review. \nOVERALL- 8/10\nI'd say Evangelion is the classic that people say it to be, with decent plot, characters, animation (for the most part), opening and ending, and soundtrack. The mystery element is one of the biggest things that kept me coming back to watch another episode but the ending was a huge letdown due to the horrible budget. Recommendation is for more mature audiences who think when they watch anime (not me) and understand symbolism in the show.\nCONGRATULATIONS *clap clap*\n        "},

From the beginning the story hit me in the middle action of it all. Then, throughout we get glimpse of clues to what happened before the series started. I liked it with some points but I never got a clear answer to the purpose of the plot. So if watching this make sure to pay close attention and maybe have to repeat the watch to possible understand it.\nCharacters seem believable and some questionable and then others annoying. The good parts I liked was the music, the action style\n          \n        sequence, and deep emotions to the characters given.

The insertion of certain psuedo-philosophical concepts and other\n          \n        religious concepts gave great originality to the story thus what was a generic \"save mankind\" story line became a psychological analysis of the characters. \nThe largest problem posed by the plot was the creator's intent to converge numerous perspectives, themes, symbologies and messages into one single show, the creator achieved that goal to a certain degree but he did not truly succeed.\nThe plot revolves around the young man Shinji who will become one of the most important factors in deciding the survival of the human race thorugh piloting the robot \"Eva Unit 01\". While the story prior to episode 15 was nothing special and actually a bit generic and predictable, the subsequent episodes were great, they merged multiple themes and analyzed the characters to a deeper level.\nThere are quiet a lot of \"coincidences\" and flaws in the story and I will list some of them:\n1. The origins and workings of the \"Angels\" are not explained very well, leaving the viewer somewhat confused.\n2. Religious symbologies were used throughout the show and they were often misused, being based on the creator's interpretation of them rather than religious perspectives.\n3. The agels used to attack every couple of days but when Shinji was missing for one entire moth no Angels attacked the city.\n4. When Nerve was facing the Angel in space, they realized the Evas could not shoot that far so they decided to throw a lance at the Angel. Where is the logic in that, to throw farther than you can shoot?\n5. This Kaji character is ridiculous. All women like him and act like he is the last man on earth.\n6. At times, the story is predictable. For instance, when I found out that Eva were beings derived from merging humans with an angels I predicted that Shinji's mother was part of Unit 1.\n7. Most of the angels were dull, except for the one with the ability to creat an alternate dimension.\nCharacters: 7/10\nThis is where Neon Genesis Evangelion did not shine, the creation and immense development of Shinji's character made the show loose focus from the rest of the cast. The characters are fairly well portayed each one of them having something to distinguish them from the others.\nSome people seek power, some seek love, some seek happiness, some seek apreciation, some seek meaning to their actions and some seek absolute truth. In the final two episodes we discover everyone's desire.\nShinji is not your typical hero protagonist, he is not courageous, handsome or intelligent, in fact he oftens considers and describes himself as being worthless. Although some would argue that Shinji is overly emotional, acts cowardly, seeks attention and pitty to the point he becomes annoying I consider him to be one of the most believable, sympathetic and well built protagonists in all anime.\nAyanami, on the surface she is an emotionless and indiferent girl but deeper she is just lonely, a \"me and my shadow\" type of character who is often questioning what means to be alone and what is the purpose of life.\nMisato is a middle aged woman that somehow ended up occupying a high ranking position inside Nerve's ranks. She dose not have any distinctive skills nor is she particulary intelligent. Misato is portayed as a mess of a woman with no clea goal in life except for \"killing angels\", she is also portayed as being an easygoing girl who is ashamed about some of her past. In the end it is shown that she made those actions out of loneliness.\nAsuka is a german highly intelligent girl who is having psychological issues regarding her mother. Asuka is an entitled little brat who is constantly overeacting, hysterical and seeking the attention of older man, getting upset everytime something does not go according to her expectations.\nAnimation: 7/10\nThe animation and art are decent, it is clear that the show was on a tight budget. \nI personally did not expect or care much for the animation but even with it being not so good, the creators succeeded in making it fit the tone of the show.\nSound: 8/10\nThe opening theme is gorgeous, the ending theme is very good and the background music does its job very well. The voice actors have pleasant and suggestive voices that give the characters a personality.\nEnjoyment: 8/10\nOverall I enjoyed the series, mostly the later half. The episodes prior to 15 were cheesy and dull but the episodes that followed were truly great, intriguing and engaging, i highly, highly enjoyed those.\nOverall: 7.5/10\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is one of the strongest anime ever produced, it features powerful characters and an intriguing deep story. I recommend this series, it is a \"must watch\".\n        "},

If you can't, then just ignore it and don't write a scathing review about how much you hate Shinji, no one cares anymore.

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion is an interesting case, given it was released in 1995 and amount of lovers as well as haters it concentrates. Because of its popularity and influence any otaku could watch this show for the single purpose of his own culture. As for the enjoyment (and the idea of quality) there is no guarantee, the rest of this text being self-explanatory.\nThe two-thirds of the show is a basic well animated action mecha anime featuring catchy characters, provided that your are not frustrated by Shinji, that you give a shit about Rei and that you do not hate the cocky Asuka. Most episodes follow\n          \n        the same generic pattern: an enemy appears, they struggle to kill it, kill it anyway and you get the feeling of not wasting your time because of drops of “character development” here and there. It is a fine way to build a world and characters, but past five episodes it becomes boring and does not help the story moving forward.\nNote that I consider this as one of the two main flaws of TV series: the episodic format and the horribly slow pacing.\nIt is during the 20th episode (at long last!) that you get to see the inner debates happening in Shinji’s mind, eventually catching glimpses of the potential this story possesses: the psychology of the different characters given their situation and the bonds between them serves a purpose and is interesting. But then your newborn hopes are shattered by the next episodes returning to a somewhat messy episodic format, raised again by a quite fascinating flashback and knocked down by the what-the-fuck diaporama (no budget left, it seems) of “useless rambling” as a friend of mine says, during the last two episodes. It is supposed to be some deep reasoning, but all I experienced was fifty minutes of my life wasted. Add to this the fact that the same thoughts are perfectly handled during a short dialogue in the alternative ending, the movie End of Evangelion, which was very satisfying, wrapping everything perfectly and in the most impressive way (except for one scene but no one is perfect). An excellent movie I would recommend if the show was not a prerequisite.\nNow, what is left ? A bastard show torn between generic entertainment and innovative artistic approach, which matures only at the far end of the road. It is the main problem of the « deconstruction » genre (here the mecha genre is supposedly deconstructed): to roll in mud is not the smartest thing to do to prove it is dirty.\n        "},

This anime makes debat into animes fans, more precisely because of his end (which has changed twice by Gainax by the way, but here I will only talk about the end of the TV Show.)\nTo begin, Neon Genesis Evangelion have many good points.\nThe animation is very good, fluid during fight, express well the feelings of characters.\nThe atmosphere is unique, they are currents things that are repeatings and forms an overall unique.\nOST are in harmony with scenes and have a huge number of sides\n          \n        (slice of life, fight, epic, sad, reflection, tension).\nThe opening is just legendary, everybody know him.. Even if I would say that it's too much 90's for me but anyway.\nIt has also bad point:\nThe rythm changed always ! Sometimes we take our time to tell us a long story, are the fights or hyper details, and sometimes we have big ellipses, rush action or explanation, it's a bit weird sometimes but not very annoying.\nThere is a tsundere.\nWe don't really know that kind of anime we have in front of us. At the beginning I was thinking about a mecha-fight anime, after we had a lot of slice of life scenes, sometimes a lot of feeling, and finally, phisophics and reflections aspects.\nThe real subject is, the end.\nThe 2 lasts episodes are successions of plan from previous episodes with new dialogues about philosophics aspects introduces incompletely in all other episodes.\nBut this is why, for me, anybody should complains about this end. This apsects are here from the beginning of the show ! Yeah they are push to the limit with this end, but this form of reflection has always been here!\nIn addition, for me, this debate of characters into themsleves, these introspections were very interresting and are links with notion of the real world, also if it's maybe a bit long, and hard to follow their reasoning.\nBut when we are accurate to reflect, and success to identify their problems with problem of the real world, it becames non-borring, and may be interresting ! \nSo, if you haven't problem with this kind of deep reflection, no problem from this point.\nBut, if this end isn't that bad it-self, it isn't the best conclusion for this anime.\nSome things aren't conclude, or are again confused, while an other end would do the job.\nAnd we don't really know how to consider it, in what categorie we have to class it.\nMaybe the second end \"End of Evangelion\" will do it better.\n        "},

Ele é um anime clássico muito comentado, reconhecido por ser de difícil entendimento da maioria – senão todos.\nEu estava muito curiosa e resolvi assistir, coisa da qual não me arrependo, pois foi uma bela experiência. Eu recomendaria Evangelion para aqueles que gostam de refletir sobre a vida e sua origem, sobre os valores humanos, sobre a mente, resumindo, sobre filosofia.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion é um anime repleto de conceito religioso e filosofia, há frases e situações dignas de pausar o episódio\n          \n        para refletir sobre o que está sendo dito e/ou mostrado, fiz isso muitas vezes durante esses 26 episódios e foi, de fato, o que eu mais gostei.

Eu estou me sentindo muito feliz por ter tido uma boa experiência com Evangelion.\nOs personagens principais não me conquistaram, apesar de grande parte das minhas reflexões terem sido iniciadas por eles. Em minha opinião, o protagonista e suas duas amigas são os personagens mais chatos da série; uma mimada histérica, uma porta e um bebê chorão. Entretanto, os secundários são incríveis, são chamativos e carismáticos. Misato Katsuragi é a melhor personagem entre todos eles, sem sombra de dúvidas, com um desenvolvimento maravilhoso e uma personalidade incrível e carismática.\nA OST é ótima e não desprende da minha cabeça desde quando eu comecei a assistir, por sorte, são músicas boas. De fato, foi o que eu mais gostei tanto na opening quanto na ending. \nA história de Evangelion é complexa, eu ainda não entendi muito bem e tô lendo algumas teorias, mas me prendeu de uma forma absurda. Eu queria a todo custo descobrir a razão daquilo tudo, do porquê e de como. Os últimos dois episódios me sugaram catastroficamente, eu senti uma tremenda dor de cabeça porque foi o ápice do anime e eu não estava esperando por aquilo. A minha mente foi desgraçada e eu não sabia se eu estava vivendo ou somente existindo.\nNo fim, eu tive uma boa experiência e eu gostaria que todos pudessem sentir o que eu senti enquanto assistia esses 26 episódios — menos a parte da dor de cabeça. É um anime muito bom, digno de ser um clássico, tem um bom propósito e acredito que aqueles que curtem pensar irão gostar tanto quanto eu gostei. \n\n"},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n     What made neon genesis evangelion one of the most incredible and unpredictable anime witch success remains over a decade with such a ridiculous plot as: “a very depressive guy needs to pilot a giant robot for the sake of saving the world but he do not really want it” was of course the way how the show manage to conciliate so concepts in a consistent and interesting story, and most of all how all the scenes, despite how simple they appear to be, has a hidden porpoise or even an double interpretive line – what\n          \n        seems to occur a lot – and drives you to a fantastic mind blowing resolution without really resolving anything. \n     Of course this show would not have been so amazing without the magnificent character development over the episodes. This anime have done the perfect mixture of metaphysical elements like: “being”, “existence”, “conscience”, “identity” with the psychology ones that gives us the sensation of reality in the characters relation with each other. The majority scenes both tells us the story, with lots of metaphors that can be inferred, while develop the characters mind’s problems in a wonderful script. As numbers philosophers like to say 3 is a perfect number, since he is not alone as number 1 and is not imperfect as number 2 that means the dualism, in other words the triad: story/characters/narrative works perfect each one optimizing what is better in the other ones. \nThis review may contain spoiler:\n         One interesting thing is how the anime manage to relate the real explanations with good metaphors, for example Adam an Lilith with on the story are two forms of live that in contact to each other will cause a catastrophe that they called the third impact. Despite the Christian reference to an impossible love – what is quite obvious – the Adam/Lilith beings are also convenient ways to bring the men/woman dualism to the story. The way how a men and a woman feels attracted to each other and this desire of touch can generate something new – life – is well represented in the relation between Kaji and Misato and also means that human beings can open the chamber of guf an analogy to the place where the unborn souls rest. This is just a piece of how the most important philosophical concepts in evangelion are subtle showed during the day a day scenes.   \n     Another objective concept is the LCL that is literally life in a liquid, analogue to cosmological and metaphysical thoughts on substance of matter and soul. (I’m saying objectively cause LCL is literally a substance) It’s also fascinating how these concepts are well put together with empirical science researches like perfluorcarbons a breathable liquid.\n     Since I don’t want to extend myself so much let's start what's important.\n     Because of what I said before I can’t separate the characters from the story so I’m going to analyze them together.  The story starts showing us a giant monster resisting all the army ways to combat and what looks like a post-apocalyptical Tokyo without people except for a young boy waiting for a woman and in other scene the woman going to pick him up. The scenes are so well planned that you can deduce that they were expecting the monsters arrive, the army is irrelevant and Shinji hates his father just before those things come to be proven.  The human instrumentality project is mentioned just in the start and it’s very easy to figure out that it’s not just about “save the world”.  In the middle of the episode we discover the leader of NERV, Shinji’s father, called him because there are not a pilot to the robot called evangelion which can destroy the giant beings called Angels. The anime do not massively explains you why the world is in dangerous or why they are called angels, but since this might be a deep state secret you will find out as times goes by. Instead of that it is much more interesting to see what Shinji thinks about piloting the evangelion, his feelings and why he stills doing so. \n     What made me continue watching the anime was obviously the consistence of NERV as a military force. Misato really works like a battle strategist since all her strategies were interesting, creative and more than everything plausible. One of the common mistakes in mecha shows is to ignore the characters that support the pilot, but the way how evangelion use a few quantity of characters allow it to develop them as well as it could have been. \n   Besides Misato, another special mention is Asuka, who change the pace of the anime once she is the most energetic character with competitive sense and desire to pilot Evangelion. While I don’t want to spoil the story so much in this review I’m going to focus on how brilliant it was to show up the concepts of Angels – the beasts- and Evangelion – the robots – while develop Shinji Relation to Misato, Rei and his father before Asuka’s appearance. It gives you time to understand how NERV works and to understand some depressive and minimalist characters like Rei and Shinji, who don’t know very well how to express their feelings without being boring and during enough time to apparently running out of ways to entertaining you before Asuka’s arrival.   \n     Overall the anime has pretty dense information to show in just 26 episodes and it would be not possible to develop the characters, presenting their uncertainty and mind problems, showing the hidden story of NERV and SEELE and their contribution in the second impact while made us entertained in epic robot’s battle without the entire director’s efforts. Hideaki Anno really emerged on the story to do the scrip perfect as it was and that’s why I can say without a sign of doubt that he is evangelion."},

Better story flow and continues past the last episode. They are not movie summaries and tell the story much better if you ask me.\nNow for why I ranked this so low.\nThe show started out fine I enjoyed it for most of it, it was around episode 19 or 20 when it starts to go down hill for me all. Every bit of character development starts to regress, Shinji the most, is insanely frustrating. They start doing the dream stats that take up 10 mins\n          \n        of an episode and do nothing but loop and flash rapid images at you so fast and bright that there should be a warning. I feel like the anime was going in a good direction but the last 5 episode killed the entire thing for me.\nHowever if you are going to watch this skip episode 25 and 26, and just go to the movie \"Sequel\", it picks up where episode 24 leave off.\n        "},

Some hold it as a masterpiece and revolutionary for its time, while others argue that it is just confused writing and just a vent for Hideaki. I myself believe that although it has some pretty well deserved criticism, Neon Genesis Evangelion should be held in high regards for what it does right.\nRegardless of whether you'll like it or not, the key thing about NGE is to tell People you have watched NGE. It is without a doubt the most highly debated and discussed anime stemming from\n          \n        the original best girl contest (Rei vs Asuka) to actually diving down the rabbit and weeding out the symbolism Hideaki uses.\nSo don't just take my word for it and discover whether or not NGE is your cup of tea\nNow to actually breakdown the review:\n\nStory 8/10,\nIn my opinion, Evangelion is a Drama Slice of Life disguised as Mech series, with a straight forward space invaders type plot where the protagonist is the main player. Not to say that this is not exciting or bad, but the real money and enjoyment comes from the development of Shinji/Asuka and some Hideaki Anno spice (the dumpster loads of religious symbolism). All in all, between the fighting and inner character struggles, NGE has a very entertaining storyline that will keep you watching\nMy MAIN criticism for evangelion stems from the ending, there is no way for me personally to come up with an explanation for the ending of the tv series without supplementing it with the End of Evangelion movie. So whether someone dropped the ball on funding, or Hideaki wasn't able to tie the end nicely when making the tv series. The fact is if I can't explain the tv ending alone without the movie then the anime feels very rash and incomplete. Without the movie I would score the tv series story a 6.5-7, with the movie I would score it an 8-9 so overall the score of 8 is slightly generous but deserving.\nArt 9/10,\nIf Gainax was struggling with funding (as stated in synopsis) I did not see it in this anime. The action and fighting looks very smooth and it still has that old anime feel to it (not an animation expert sorry for the vague feel). It surprises me when I realize that NGE(1995) is older than other big animes such as 'Berserk'(1997) and Cowboy Bebop(1998). For it's time and what Gainax had in the tank Evangelion worked magic.\nCan't also forget the iconic explosions (the cross) that is used in many series for the next 2 decades (i.e Unlimited blade works, kill la kill off the top of my head)\n\nSound 9/10,\nPretty generous but  I believe that there are some songs on the ost that play at the right crucial times.\nVoice acting wise it is phenomenal,speaking of the japanese version, I have not watched the dub.\n\nCharacter 10/10\nAlthough side characters are not fleshed out that well, the main cast, specifically Asuka and Shinji are extremely well written with their specific issues and back stories.\nThis anime is a story of discovering self reliance through adversity not only physically but primarily psychologically. Just to give a heads up, there are plenty of times where you will get extremely frustrated at the characters' thought process and actions but that's one of the points of NGE.\nI will come out and say the protagonist is probably the best written character in all anime although I know there are plenty who agree with that statement.\n*sigh* In terms of Best Girl I am Team Rei, the writing for Asuka is atleast 100x better, but I believe Hideaki goes out of his way just to make Asuka unlikable. Character wise Asuka>Rei, Best Girl Wise Rei> Asuka\n\nEnjoyment 10/10,\nI originally intended to take like a week and a half to watch this anime. I ended up watching it+ End of Evangelion in 4 days... I just was so interested in it the history/hype, the action, trying to find the true meaning behind it. It has good rewatch value because I've watched the tv series twice+the end of evangelion+ the rebuild movies. It just the type of series that draws me in\n\nOverall 10/10,\nAs I stated in my intro I stand on the side that deems NGE as a masterpiece. Just the fact that it opens discussion about it ~20 years later is just a testament to how historical it is in the anime world. With Gainax's and Hideaki's personal strungles it is a huge feat. That is why I herald it as the most iconic anime of all time and regardless of the outcome of your opinion, I would highly suggest watching it\n"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    Although Eva begins like almost any mech anime series, it quickly transcends the traditional bounds typical of such anime and becomes a fascinating piece of character study in an apocalyptic setting. While the action is sometimes excessive and often takes away from the psychological aspect, the premise itself is quite fascinating.\nEva heavily borrows from various religious dogma, and that is one of the reason it has a mystical, albeit often nonsensical atmosphere (Lance of Longinus is an example of religious allegory which misfired). Lots of time is spent on various pseudo-technological scenes, the only good thing about that being that it nicely contrasts with the\n          \n        religious thematics. \"Fan Service\" was also mostly unnecessary.\nOverall, Eva is a fascinating anime but does not fulfill all of its potential. The characters, although are fascinating and have great interaction, are static (although the writers try to make them seem dynamic) and their emotional makeup sometimes does not smoothly flow from episodes to episodes.\nNonetheless, despite its flaws, this is a great series. It grabs onto the viewer like few others, and only later can be analyzed without bias. Saying that it is thought-provoking would be an understatement. Everyday life is beautifully juxtaposed with the apocalyptic motifs, creating a nostalgic feel (which is especially worthy of praise because the anime takes place in the future). It is vague yet involving, impressionist in the sense that it affects the viewer like no other. Great musical score raises it above many others. Although a detailed unbiased analysis may show multiple flaws in various areas, as a whole Evangelion is amazing. Recommended to anyone who can appreciate art as a whole without looking too much into specific details, and is involving even after multiple viewings.\n\nStory   8\nAnimation  7\nSound   9\nCharacter   8\nEnjoyment   8\nOverall       8/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Oh jeez, where do you even begin with Eva? I remember hearing people screaming about how much they love this show, while others say it's utter nonsense and shouldn't be famous at all. What can you take from that, I mean honestly? I didn't know what to think, so I picked up a cheap pirate DVD copy of it (because real ones don't exist) and gave it a spin. My head is still spinning to this day.\nWhat is Evangelion? That's a tough question to answer, because it's pretty much a story about a boy recruited to pilot a giant robot to fight monsters who want\n          \n        to exterminate humanity, except it's not, well not really. This show has more layers than a french onion wrapped in 3 rolls of clingfilm. I don't think it's possible to summarise, so I'll just skip to the main parts.\nThe overall story of Eva is so wonderfully unique and engaging, if somewhat batshit crazy by the end of it, but I don't think I've seen a better fleshed out set of characters anywhere (Maybe Steins;Gate at a stretch). Each character is damaged in their own way, which becomes more obvious as the show progresses. There's overconfidence and inability, lack of self belief, cowardice and frustration...  Every person in this show is such a unique individual, and watching them interact, bicker, and develop is still an example of perfect storytelling. You get to see people pushed to their absolute limits, then pushed just a little further. It's like a trainwreck, part of you just can't look away. The animation is superb for 1995, which may feel a little dated today (think monster design), but the motion and dynamics all hold up extremely well. It's good to feel unnerved by some of the art, it's actively trying to be.\nFrom here, the actual plot is already standing on the shoulders of giants, which is where things really get fun. The monsters aren't actually monsters, they're \"angels\". There is a shadow organisation pulling all the strings in the background who may want to save humanity, or destroy it. The giant robots are a lot more than what they seem. Pretty much everything established within the first few episodes is inverted, leaving you a little confused but at the same time quite interested to see where it goes. People actually break down from the stress they experience, like the pilots of the giant robots, and when I say break down I mean fully. They suffer so much at parts that you can't help but empathise, and by then you're already emotionally invested.\nHold on to your brain, because by the ending, it might just melt and drip out of your ears. No spoilers, but the ending is very avant garde (read: they ran out of money) so there's a lot of interpretation and metaphor going on, but I thought it worked pretty well. What I got from it left me speechless and dying to talk about it with anyone who'd listen at the same time.\nEva has so much going on that it really does need a second viewing and some downtime for thinkin' about it, because it took me about 3 times to finally get (most of) the story. Saying that, there's such a feeling of satisfaction when you do see behind all the doors. I'd say it's like shakespeare in so much that it makes no sense when you read it and there's an insane amount of stuff going on nearly all the time, but it is actually very solid and entertaining. You can tell the creator really put a lot of himself into this, and jeez, that poor guy was really suffering. You know what they say, you can't make a painting without pain.\nI've got to talk about the sound, it's some of the most memorable I've ever heard. There are so many themes that you'll find yourself humming after you watch this, each one very different from the others but all equally superb. These pretty much became my ringtones. Evangelion giant robot fights owe so much to their soundtrack, without it there wouldn't be half the depth to their drama. I really enjoyed the musical dissonance employed towards the latter half, when things go from bad to the worst. Someone has a complete nervous breakdown to the most inspirational and hopeful music you can think of. It's jarring in the extreme, but that's what Eva is meant to be.\nAs far as plot goes, there is nothing close to where this show went, and it's range of characters is still impeccable to this day. I'm pretty sure Evangelion probably fried some part of my young brain, but I totally fell for this show and think it really is one of the greats. Watch it if you too want to get your mind opened to the point where everything starts falling out.  \n        "},

It's the only true way to look at THIS anime. \nSTORY 7/10\nNeon Evangelion is a pushed story, by episode 1 we know what's happening, it's fast paced and dire. You'l be on the edge of your seat for the most part. Although the story itself is very repetitive, the goals and threats always have you wanting more. Of course I reference the synopsis to explain the plot - take it from me this show is worth watching for the plot (story).\nThe plot does malform into something we didn't expect\n          \n        or want though, but I will let this slide because it's during the last few episodes of the show.\nART 5/10\nStudio Gainax didn't have a budget set when they started work on Evangelion. You will see a ton of 'pauses' that seem to last too long during this show.\nFor example the classic Shinji train station pause, this lasts for over a minute. This is too long - this happens about 2-4 times during the show. \nThe action is WHOA, wowza, Gainax did a great job on the action scenes in this anime. So in due respect they did make up for the lack of facial movements and/or long pauses during the show.\nThe major quarrel that I have is the last few episodes. Sketched, uncoloured, nonsense. This is the perfect example of a studio running out of money because they didn't plan ahead.\nTake this to mind when you watch this show.\nI had to give it a 5/10 based on this fault, it really ruins the feel of the show and doesn't end the show on the right terms. So much so that movies were released after the show ended to try to redeem the series. Which in turn only made it worse.\nSOUND 10/10\nBest. Anime. Opening. Ever.\nAmazing soundtrack, little more I can say about it that is negative.\nCHARACTER(S) 6/10\nEvangelion uses it's characters properly, every cast member has some dirt, nothing is sacred. The only issue is we don't get to see the majority of these flaws. It's like you just turned 16 and your sweet 16 is riddled with your little sister's friends. Utter disappointment, you expected more.\nOn the other hand you will fall in love with Misato, also with the relationships formed in this series. Until of course the series comes tumbling down, but of course I can't talk about that, I'd ruin the show for you.\nENJOYMENT 8/10\nThe reason why I gave this show an 8/10 for enjoyment is because the action, the action will get your caring about the cast members.\nYou feel involved, and that's a strong connection, and very enjoyable.\nOVERALL\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is a good time no alcohol required.\nI suggest a purchase of the series.\nIt is worth your GP\n"},

AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!\nIf you want to watch an anime that was so popular that it influenced future generations of anime and helped creating the foundation of the mecha genres then this is an anime that you must watch. It is considered to be one of the most revolutionary animes of all times since its launch during the mid 1990s. This anime does not just show fancy and flashy mecha fights but it is much deeper than that. Neon Genesis Evangelion is an anime where deep symbolism, philosophy, psychology and religion are used\n          \n        to bring meaning in the story. To put it simply, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a very deep anime with a very layered story. A story so layered that even if you watched it over 3 times you will still be like “What?” or “Huh?” or “What the heck happened?!”. It is a story where you will itch your head just to find the right meaning but then will throw you off completely due to another meaning that contradicts it. Which will then lead to google it in the end.\nStory: \nThe story is everything in this anime and the method of its storytelling is unorthodox compared to many other animes before it that it became a foundation to future animes that follows Neon Genesis Evangelion. The story does not feed you with information and will not explicitly show them to you. It will only give you tiny bits at a time and will only tell you half of anything. They would even put some scenes without any context (However, that might probably because of budget cuts) or making the scenes very ambiguous (Based on the interpretation of the viewers). Most animes will not do this due to its difficulty with a high probability of it turning out to be horrible but Neon Genesis Evangelion did it so well that we just don’t know what is going on in the story but at the same time you know what is going on due to its chronological plot structure.\nArt and Sound: \nThe art might not be something that many of you could appreciate due to it being an anime from the early 1990s so the aesthetic will not be as good as our current modern animes. However, it would be worthwhile to watch as you will eventually ignore the old art style. There will also be some scenes where nothing is happening, or there would be a lack of lines or color. But that would be mostly because the anime was didn't have enough budget to do it. However, they make up for it by making the fight scenes really detailed. The animation style is also very unique and represents a lot of psychological scenes like a single scene in an elevator where no one talks and the tense ambient atmosphere, will make you think that you are actually there and could feel the tension with the characters. The sounds are very well placed and are often classical music such as Beethoven or Bach. The music gives an even stronger attachment to the scene combined with all the emotions. Voice acting is also well done in both the English and Japanese dub. There would be some problems with the English dub during the early phase of the series but they would eventually get better as the story progress. Probably due to the voice actors getting used to their roles. Both dubs were able to capture the characters mood and mannerisms to a very surprising extent. The screams for Shinji were also very well done in both dubs.\nCharacters: \nThis is the strongest part in NGE, the characters are the most important device in the story. It does not follow the typical plot oriented stories but to a more character oriented story. They are as realistic as you can get to a human in an anime or something that you might have gotten from the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders” due to their very human distresses and personalities. The series was able to show the struggles and insanity of the main character to a wonderful effect. The main character is not like many mecha characters or even many anime characters in general. He is not a character who is confident, brave or has a special ability. He is far too human with very human characteristics. The fear of being rejected, the desire to be useful and the want to run away from all problems. When a problem occurs, it is often instinctive to run away from them or try to avoid them due to the fear of failure and being hurt in the process. As well as the fear of being close to anyone and creating mental fronts to protect oneself from any emotional harm (Hedgehog Dillema). To isolate oneself. The story is not where you put an impossible human in an impossible situation but real human placed in an impossible and deadly situation.\nThe timid Shinji to egotistical Asuka, to enigmatic Rei Ayanami, and the ambitious Gendo Ikari. Evangelion goes into the minds and motivations of these characters, showcasing exactly what makes them who they are from their passions to their deepest insecurities or fears. These characters were so well done, powerful and twisted in their own way that they became some of the most popular anime characters in existence. Everyone is so twisted that the show somehow resembles that of human psyche and our desire to escape conflicts. These characters have also influenced many other future anime characters especially the character of a quiet emotionless doll named Rei Ayanami which now became a expy trope for many other characters from many new animes after NGE. Like hundreds of characters. You could even expect a Rei Ayanami type character on any large harem animes these days.\nImportant note: Episode 25 and 26 of the series would appear to be very confusing, strange and a big what did I just watched to many but I recommend you to continue watching it. This is because you would need that for the movie “End of Evangelion” in a particular scene. End of Evangelion is the movie that was created to make up for the last two episode of the Evangelion series due to not having the necessary budget to finish the series. You should watch this because it shows the true conclusion of the Neon Genesis series. After watching all that, you may then proceed to watch the Rebuild movies and I got to tell you that those movies have amazing pacing and eye bulging animation. Not to mention, some Dandere moments from Rei Ayanami if you are a fan of her.\nI would greatly recommend this anime and I am sure you will be enjoy it and get very confused by it. I rate this a 10/10 for its deep very human characters, action scenes, and Studio Gainax’s improvisation of the anime due to their low budget. "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    This is a review of Neon Genesis Evangelion+End of Evangelion because you can’t have one without the other. To me the End of Eva is the logical progression to warp the series further for the purpose of the viewer using 100% of their brainpower to embrace the ride they’re experiencing. Watch NGE for its story and End of Eva for its experience as a piece a piece of abstract art.\n	That’s right it’s time for more required reading. And let me be the millionth person to say yes, you should watch Daddy Issues the Show. Which I’m starting to think required reading involves tons of thinking,\n          \n        especially on the ass-end of NGE. Robots don’t finish a final angel and the hero doesn’t get the girl. I prefer an ending that gets way too Freudian and everyone you’ve grown to love over 24 episodes is strapped to a chair by their own existential dread. That being said, I prefer this show to most. Evangelion is simultaneously an artistic character study and an apocalyptic story of the descent of mankind’s control. It subverts and defies genre in a single sweep capped off by a film, making it a titan of animation still today. While well renowned, it’s a challenging egg to crack if you plan on gleaning a message for it. Eva is not only a great show but a great challenge, as it makes the risky move of pairing a compelling, subversive story up to cryptic and terrifying ending in the final film. The underlying story can bubble past the surface plot and characters to the point where it makes the story into hilarious nonsense if you take SEELE as the antagonist and the plot at face value. But the dark, serious tone throughout makes the madness at the end a treat for viewers looking for a piece of thoughtful art as much as a great story.\n	The art’s age makes it all the more a technical marvel even in comparison with modern animation standards. It didn’t skimp on animation a la Sailor Moon and Pokémon, and its cell animation is just as sharp yet just as fluid as Bebop or Berserk. As though the animation weren’t as enough of a technical marvel, the art grows into an even more superb feat thanks to Anno’s stellar direction. The characters, action, and situations are not only beautifully crafted but strategically placed to strike at emotions, feel the intensity of a cross shaped supernova, fuck with the viewers’ fragile existential fears, all when most appropriate. The direction applied by the artistic direction is a masterpiece all on its own.\n	Some episodes move along for the full 20 minutes, essentially equating to a well crafted episodic short story. One such example is the Magma Diver episode, which I’m sure sparked the deviantart inflation fetish before it was cool. But then other episodes will go off into Kubrick-esque cerebral nightmares of Shinji and pretty much all the EVA pilots fighting with their own minds that have been twisted by apocalyptic growing pains. They’re very jarring to experience in an apocalyptic action robot show, but they are so, SO relevant to future watches of the series. They may not find a place in the plot and will probably distract the viewer from the action, but they’re masterfully placed to challenge the viewer to think in a way that few anime to date accomplish. The action and psych profiles are the strongest part of the show, but there’s so many scenes that are seemingly mundane that add so much to the experience. Ritsuko and Misato chatting during an Eva unit’s loading bookends the full spectrum of character emotions and thoughts. This or the silent elevator scene work as non traditional ways to show character interaction and internal thoughts of the characters without adding exposition or time. The shows heaviest scenes bear the most weight when they are in the same sequence of episodes of these scenes, and flesh the multi-faceted experience of the show even more. \n	The show’s fairness towards the complexity of its characters is unparalleled. The show focuses on their feelings of the situation not only to escalate the plot and their relationships with each other, but as abstract character studies to remember Asuka will swat at her dunkoph peers for their inferior piloting skills, but show her delicately weeping for mummy in another scene. Her back story isn’t expressed much, but even for a support character she has more puzzle piece personality to put into their protagonists. I can’t go into every character without spoiling Anno’s point of the show, which to me, is creating characters of circumstance in order to make you think. While not always clear, each little interaction or nuance about them makes the viewer fear for how they face the fear of their impact or lack thereof on humanity and the apocalyptic world. Each of them develop until the end of the show where it goes off the rails in End of Evangelion, but all the development prior to the end of the series/movie is some of the most impression-leaving art you may ever experience. The most underdeveloped characters remain to be Rei and Kaoru, but Rei is intentionally underdeveloped and Kaoru works as a final, mysterious push into the a\nabyss of the movie finale, despite his rushed appearance and backstory. \n	It’s great, it’s confusing, but it’s up to you to enjoy and experience. It's biggest and possibly most polarizing flaw is a lack of an ending or resolution from antagonists that never meant much in the first place. Yet it's derailing conclusion has created a legendary, if obtuse, experience, and in my eyes its confusion gives it more power as abstract art.  Evangelion is a successful and bloody series of breadcrumbs with the intent to deliver a gloriously cerebral experience. "},

It only took half an episode from me to completely reverse that. \n-Story-\nThe storyline is very good, very imaginative, very interesting.  The plot is very motivating and doesn't stall a lot.  There's a bunch of action in the series and a lot of twists and turns in the plot.  There's a scene where I actually gaped at the screen in disbelief.  I legitimately had to rewind a little bit to make sure my eyes were indeed seeing properly.  A\n          \n        majority of the series has the same formula: insert mild issue between the characters and/or possible solution for upcoming Eva battle, Angel descends, Eva unit deployed, Darwinism prevails.  The reason I rank the story as a 7 is because I found the ending unsatisfying and rather cheap.  Like they didn't know how to end the series.  Don't expect the ending of Evangelion to be like Gurren Lagann.\n-Art-\nAwesome!  Beautiful, but not afraid to be gory.\n-Sound-\nVery good.  Voice acting is very good and appropriate.  Soundtrack is great.  The use of \"Fly Me To the Moon,\" as the theme of this anime is... strange and dreamlike.  \n-Characters-\nSo let's talk about Shinji.  Shinji is not your hero in this series.  I've heard lot of people complain about Shinji because he's a whiny pansy, but I feel the series really makes you sympathize with him.  There's a lot of really good reasons for Shinji to behave the way he does.  He's some poor 14-year-old kid thrown repeatedly into emotionally traumatizing scenarios due to his uncanny ability to fight in an alien-killing machine.  He probably has the world's most pathetic motivation for doing the things he does, but the series gives you opportunities to understand him.  \nI enjoy how Asuka and Rei are kind of like foils for each other.  \nEach character is uniquely psychologically messed up.  For reals.  A friend of mine and I joked about the application for NERV having a questionnaire like: (1) Have you lost at least one loved one?  (2) Do you suffer from bouts of depression?  (3) On a scale of 1-10, how much angst would you say you have? \nFavorite character: Honestly?  Eva Unit 01.  That thing is a beast.\n        "},

Even as I write this, having viewed only the series and not the highly-recommended movies, I feel that I will soon read this review and shake my head in disapproval. And I'm sure that NGE fans will argue that the series goes from being good to fantastic once things are explained in the movies. But sadly, series must be reviewed as series alone, and when NGE is viewed as such it simply isn't the masterpiece that it's claimed to be. While the animation is top-notch (especially considering this was done in the mid-90s) and the voices (especially the English cast) are memorable and lively, the storyline doesn't live up to the hype in the end. There are claims that the lack of a truly conclusive ending was due to budget constraints, and that the creators made up for it with the movies. Let's hope so.\nBecause really, I find myself wanting to love NGE for all that is great about it. The characters are immediately lovable, well-developed, complex, troubled, and funny as hell. Battles, while predictable and at times repetitive, are generally fast-paced and interesting due to the constantly evolving nature of the Angels. And underlying it all is uncertainty: until the very end (and even after) viewers will be asking questions. But such uncertainty, when not resolved, can be a disastrous mistake. In NGE's case, the show's premise, character development, animation, and voice cast should be enough to prevent any post-series regret, but the absolute necessity of viewing the movie detracts from its value as a stand-alone series. Moreover, without the crucial details the plot seems stale, and I found many of the \"twists\" predictable. Still, it is my bet that the NGE story is a fascinating one which touches on religion, philosophy, and psychology in a way that few (if any) anime have ever done. Alone, however, it suffers from an ending hindered by a poor budget, haughty idealism, or both.\nAnimation: 7.8/10\nAudio: 7.2/10\nStory/Script: 7.5/10\nOverall Score: 7.5/10 (Very Good)\n\nFind a complete synopsis with review and downloadable episodes/OST at my blog, http://animefiend.blogspot.com\n        "},

The art and sound are nothing remarkable (mostly an age problem at this point; although the OP is still admittedly catchy as hell) but acceptable enough. The story is.... something I guess. Should I call it interesting? I guess so. Is it engaging? As the series goes\n          \n        on, honestly I can't say it is. In fact the closer I got to the end, the more detached and well... bored I felt. This isn't even including the very last section of the show (you know which part), where the budget really shows and the patience I had of this show really came to the test as I had to sit through 40 minutes of all this deep philosophy of one's self and soul and stuff that the show kinda dripped into your mouth much more easily the first 24 episodes but then they cram all of it into 2 episodes and it's just.... ughhhh...\nIt's both overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time. It's boring. I hated the ending. It didn't make me think. It did the opposite really; it made me want to turn my brain off until I heard the mellow ending song signifying my experience watching this show had finally come to an end. I felt absolutely no connection to any of these characters at the end. The only thing I was feeling was just... unfulfilled. I really expected more from this show. I wanted to love it, to praise it, to hold it to high esteem. But as of right now having finally watched through it, I can only say it was at best, okay. "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This is it. This is the big one. This is quite possibly the most controversial anime of all time. Not only that, but it is also likely that no other anime has created such a monumental (third) impact on the medium as a whole (except possibly Akira). This... Is... Neon Genesis Evangelion. Though when examining the every individual aspect of the show, the series may seem flawed. However, when one looks at the series as a whole, the absolute perfection that is Neon Genesis Evangelion shines through.\nThe one of the most important aspects of NGE is its story. NGE serves as a deconstruction of the\n          \n        mecha genre, choosing to focus on the mentality of those who pilot the Eva units, as well as the people in command of procedures and operations. The first part of the series is fairly standard for the genre with it usually introducing a new Angel (the monstrous enemy of mankind) each week for the pilots and command to find a new way to beat it. Though the series has a more depressive tone than its contemporaries, nothing seems out of the ordinary for the genre. However this changes with a big reveal at the end of episode 15, and by a complete tonal shift in episode 16 that is solidified by episode 18. From here, the show turns almost completely into the psychological narrative the series is now known for, which is one of its best parts. However, there are still flaws to the story. There are many cases of events not being thoroughly explained, which can lead to some confusion when trying to follow the story. There are also many cases of many plot points never being described at all, or never reaching a conclusion. Though this may help the series to maintain its longevity, it can be unsatisfying to not have the closure. There are also some minor plot holes, though nothing that ruins the overall story. Ultimately, the flaws of the story do little to diminish the series as a whole.\nThe production value of NGE’s animation is also another notable aspect, though perhaps its least appealing. Animation involving the series mechs is always crisp and has a constant standard of quality. As the series names take, this would be only just. The same cannot be said for the animation of general character interactions. As many already know, Gainax (series producers) struggled to properly balance their budget throughout the series. This mostly reflects in their character animation. Corners were cut especially for dialogue, as many characters deliver their lines either with their mouths covered, or off screen. This does make the series feel rather cheaply done at times. However, one thing is rather odd about this laziness with animation: it can occasionally work in the series favor. Some scenes were enhanced by this lack of animation quality. An awkward scene between 2 characters in episode 3. is suddenly extended longer than it should be, making the audience feel awkward is well. A scene of dramatic tension in episode 24 is elongated, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats for over a minute. Then there's the ending to the series… but more on that later. So though many scenes do fall flat, others actually obtain unprecedented success from low quality.\nThe series audio quality is mostly great, and the music is a real treat. One cannot mention NGE without talking of the series superb opening, “A Cruel Angel’s Thesis”, which sits on many anime fans’ favorite openings list (it’s number 1 on mine). The song handles each of its transitions perfectly, starting with an eerie chorus, to upbeat trumpets, then builds up into the rest of the song. Perhaps the most impressive transition it makes is how it morphs from coinciding with the series, to contrasting it by the end. The ending theme is a cover of “Fly Me to the Moon” by Frank Sinatra. Though it is catchy, the “engrish” can be annoying. The singer also switches, and not all share the same level of high quality. The rest of the music for the series is very well done. The instrumentals are all high quality, and help to enhance each scene. “Decisive Battle” creates the rush of preparations to stop the oncoming threat, while “Rei I” creates the creepy image of a seemingly empty character. Best of all is “Thanatos”, which is really a testament to the series. It starts with depressing music of the violin (at least I think it's the violin. I don't music), then is completely uplifted by the flute into a hopeful tune,m. This really speaks to the series tone as a whole, almost as if the song itself is saying no matter how bleak life seems to be, there will always be hope. The only thing that bothers me on the soundtrack is cicadas. Often times in outdoors scenes, a track is played of cicadas chirping in the background. There are a lot of outside scenes, meaning a lot of cicada chirping, which annoys me. As for the Japanese voice actors, they all did extremely well for their roles, and were able to perfectly deliver the characters’ emotions. I haven't watched the English dub, but I've heard that it is pretty low quality.\nFinally, the most important part of Neon Genesis Evangelion, without a doubt, is its characters. The Eva pilots consist of Shinji (main character), Rei, and Asuka, and other important characters include Misato and Gendo. Shinji Ikari is the depressed main character of this series, and his depression results from the absence of his mother since childhood, and the neglect of his father, Gendo. Along with depression, Shinji has also developed Hedgehog’s dilemma and a severe aversion to pain. Because of this, Shinji struggle to develop meaningful relations with others, as he both fears hurting them, and being hurt by them. This only continues to feed his depression. Perhaps the most interesting feature that sets Shinji apart from other anime protagonists is his inability to grow as a person. Because of this, many people often dislike Shinji and see him as a pathetic weakling. However, this is what actually makes him such a compelling character. More importantly, it makes him a HUMAN character. People aren't superhumans that can do anything, and people don't always move on from their problems, and Shinji embodies that perfectly. Next is Rei Ayanami, the (best girl) cold, seemingly empty shell of a person. She has basically created her own character archetype through her generally silent and emotionless demeanor. Rei and her origins remain an enigma throughout most of the story. The only thing that is known about her is that she has a very close relationship with Gendo, and is willing to do anything for him, even at the cost of her own well being and her life. However, though it is very subtle, Rei begins to change due to her interactions with Shinji. She begins to shift what bonds she had with Gendo to him, and slowly begins to wonder what her own true purpose is. The reveal of what she actually is gives a reasoning to her strong ties with Shinji and Gendo, as well as to her emotionless nature. Saying anymore would be spoilers, so I'll end the (best girl) Rei discussion here. Asuka Langley Soryu is the third and final Eva pilot. She is definitely the most lively of the pilots (although there's not much competition), but also the most narcissistic and arrogant. She is brash, always wanting to do things her own way, and craves constant praise for her actions. She wants nothing more to receive special treatment and attention for everything she does. However, this spawns from a massive skeleton in her closet, which reveals her actions to seem more childish than originally perceived. Because of her past, she requires praise in order to feel a sense of self worth and fulfillment. However, as she begins to realize that Shinji is becoming more successful than she is, she begins to lose her confidence, which leads to her downfall. Miss to, though not carrying the weight of the pilots, is the one who really holds everything together. Like everyone else already mentioned, she has her own personal problems (Electra complex). However, Misato does her best to try to hide these for the well being of the other pilots (even if she must often resort to her alcoholism to do so). Like Asuka, she is also a strong female character, and finds herself in leadership roles when things take a turn for the worst. She is also not afraid to speak her mind to her pilots when they are careless, nor is she afraid to try to help them through their life problems. Gendo is another very interesting character, and my personal favorite. As the audience knows, he has no relationship with his son whatsoever, and has no desire to bond with him. Gendo’s has one sole purpose in his life, and will do anything in his power to obtain his goal, even if that means manipulating others. In this regard, Gendo is actually much like his son, as neither him nor Shinji demonstrate the ability to move on with their lives. Though the series originally presents Gendo negatively, it actually begins to build him up as a better person than we preconceive. Even Shinji starts to see some good in his father, before these notions are completely torn to shreds again. The last characters worth mentioning are the Eva’s themselves. Though they do seemingly little more than hold the pilots, they actually each reflect their pilots. Eva-00 is blue, representing Rei’s calm, but cold personality, and its single eye shows that Rei is only viewing life by the single aspect of serving Gendo. Meanwhile, Eva-02 is red, showing Asuka’s brash, arrogant personality, and the 4 eyes show how Asuka tries to take on as many challenges as possible, even though that this many viewpoints may cloud her visions. Finally, Eva-01 is purple, which is a fusion of red and blue, symbolizing Shinji’s own inner turmoil that prevents him from really being collected like Rei or confident like Asuka. It's 2 eyes show it's humanity, while also the inhumanity of what happens to the pilot.\nUsually I wouldn't focus on the ending in a review, as I don't think an entire day should be judged by the quality of its sunset. However,  NGE’s is worth mentioning, if only for the controversy surrounding it. It is true that Gainax ran out of funds for the last 2 episodes, and that its art style doesn't really reflect the series. It is understandable if those looking for a secure ending would be disappointed. However, as I “briefly” mentioned before, the characters are the most important part of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Since the last 2 episodes stand as a psychological breakdown of the characters, I think it actually works very well as an ending. However, if you want true closure, then watch the alternate/parallel ending to the series, “End of Evangelion” (though that might not give you complete closure either).\nTo conclude, Neon Genesis Evangelion is far from perfect. Pacing, plot, animation, and several other issues are present throughout the shows 26 episodes. However, every piece, whether it's as broken as the characters’ lives or as perfect as Gendo’s pose, created the closest thing to a perfect anime that the world has ever seen. However, whether you think you'll love the series or hate it, you NEED to watch Neon Genesis Evangelion. It is a right of passage for all anime fans. To quote Fuyutsuki, “Your truth can be changed simply by the way you accept it. That's how fragile the truth for a human is”. That is basically what this series is. Now it's your turn to watch it, and form your own truth on Neon Genesis Evangelion."},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    Because of my experience, and many other people's experiences with Neon Genesis Evangelion, I find it difficult to write an objective review on this anime, simply because, well,\nIt's shit.\nAnd despite this fact, I can't help but to love it with all of my heart, being the disgusting neck-bearded inbreed that I am. From the countless people I have met regarding this show, I have found that how much you like yourself is inversely proportionate to how much you'll like the show, including its concluding film 'The End of Evangelion'.\nAlright, let's add some context to it.\nEvangelion was the first of its kind, bridging the gap between\n          \n        shows made for children and late night shows made for obsessive otaku, and created something that a wide age group could appreciate, and most importantly, relate to. The subject matter concerned in this show is something I believe related not only to many Japanese people at the time, but just many introverted people in general, much like the director himself, Hideaki Anno.\nEvangelion is praised most often for its role as a deconstruction of the mecha genre, but I want to talk about something beyond this aspect of the show. The show does start as a typical 'monster of the week', and despite the seemingly mundane nature of me mentioning this, I believe it is held up well by the subtle and masterful visual direction of Hideaki Anno (I'll be talking a lot about this guy btw). Many of his shots will always mean something in the long run, and everything ranging from the items shown in frame to even the camera angles are used to imply certain aspects of the characters and their motives. It strikes a good balance between substance and style, leaning a bit more towards style, and I feel that this aspect of direction holds up the show extremely well especially during the second half of the show, as forbidden truths are revealed and the characters' mental states are constantly challenged.\nWhich brings me to another point - one thing that I have seen in Evangelion that I have never seen in any other show is the emotional rawness that had been poured into the show. During production, and long before it, Hideaki Anno suffered through clinical depression, and this aspect of stress and almost ruthless self-reflection showed through as the show progressed. I feel that it isn't too far fetched to say that Shinji, the main character, is somewhat of an extension or reflection of Mr. Anno's self-image. \nFor me, this was a huge plus, as it created additional meaning as something that related to the creator's struggles, but I also acknowledge that this can be a drawback for many viewers as Shinji is quite a self-loathing character (aka a whining bitch). Though this aspect of the show does interfere with other important parts of the story (which I will talk about later), I couldn't help but to admire this raw honesty and how painfully relatable it can all be at times.\nI believe that his honesty is also what gave the many tragic moments of the show the impact they needed. Hideaki Anno surely knew 'crazy', and he knew how to implement it well. The show does gradually become more violent as the stakes get higher, but this violence isn't 24/7, occurring only between more calmer parts of the story - but when violence does occur, it is brutal, grotesque, and presents the animalistic nature of humanity in general.\nI think the effectiveness of this violence can be futher explained through other seemingly 'violent' or 'edgy' shows, such as 'Elfen Lied' or 'Mirai Nikki'. Courtesy of what Demolition D (Youtube Anime Reviewer) mentions in his Evangelion analyses, the violence in shows like Elfen Lied and friends are, despite the gore and the blood, tryhard and heavy-handed. The violence in these shows are there only for shock-value and a poor attempt at catering to an older audience. It doesn't help that the characters in these shows are written with more shallow motivations. Evangelion's violence on the other hand has meaning, and there are implications for the characters' motivations and psychological well-being for every incident that occurs.\nFinally, the characters - I believe this is where the show shines, and is also why it is so often praised as the mech genre deconstruction. The main characters of this show resemble at first the typical tropes of the generic series - a timid pacifist boy, a silent 'kuudere' girl, and a loud rowdy 'tsundere' girl. Of course, because this is Hideaki Anno, these tropes are twisted, and he inserts implications behind these characters' actions, effectively highlighting how unnatural these kinds of people really are. It's like Anno is making a statement towards the otaku with this aspect of the show - that for a girl to act according to these ideals, they would have to be mentally fucked in the head. Each of the characters in the show have deep seeded traumas that drive them at a subconscious level, and I found it extremely interesting to see how these characters would deal with each obstacle that got thrown at them.\nThe show isn't without its flaws though, and as I mentioned before with Hideaki Anno's depression and deteriorating state of mind at the production's making, the show does suffer from it, mainly the plot itself. The plot as whole is a mess, especially during the second half. Many points can be difficult to understand, and in addition with the very stylistic way of directing, some sequences can be especially confusing to digest. Evangelion is one of those shows that become more clearer with every rewatch, and with every rewatch you do, you may always find something new. So with this in mind, I can't say that it is for everyone, especially those who are just looking for a good ol' time.\nI believe though that the concluding movie of this show 'End of Evangelion' clears some doubts about certain points of the show and, though an utter mindfuck at first, neatly wraps up many of the threads that were left hanging out in the open at the shows controversial final 2 episodes.\n---\nI don't feel it would be wrong to describe Evangelion as a masterpiece, along with the inclusion of the ending movie 'End of Evangelion', which I also definitely recommend after the show, as I feel that it gives the entire story good closure. In fact, I feel that without End of Evangelion, the show wouldn't have the praise that it does today.\nEvangelion is a mess, it's confusing, and it can be scary, so it's kind of like sex in the dark - even though you don't know what's happening, you can't help but to enjoy it (at least, some of you). Though it carries its flaws, I don't think you can deny that it is a very important show, and that you'd be doing yourself a disservice by tossing it to the side.\n        "},

Instead of giving a very nice detailed overview of why I either liked the Anime or not, I’ve decided to do a step by step re-enactment of all my reactions when watching this show from the beginning till the end. Also, these reactions are from an outsiders perspective. I did not research this anime or anything. I went into this with a fresh mind.\nReaction 1: Well this is a good start, the main character Shinji may be a\n          \n        complete pansy but he is well developed and so are all the rest of the characters. Also, Shinji may be a pansy but he at least has a reason for being so. The fate of the world is thrust on his shoulders out of no where and his father is a complete douche bag. I actually pity him :( The fights are all really cool too and so is the music. This might just turn out to be pretty good.\nReaction 2: I am now half way through this show and I still have no idea what this show is about? Plot holes are starting to show up in great amounts. Who are these Angel beings, what exactly are the Evangelion’s, why is Rei such a boring and lifeless character, why are there betrayal’s happening left and right, etc…? Doesn’t really matter though because I’m only half way, so this might be all explained down the line. The characters are still good so I got not too many complaints.\nReaction 3: Alright, so I’m nearing the end of this show and I still don’t have much answers. Some of the answers I’m getting aren’t exactly making much sense either. I know what Rei is…kind of…but it doesn’t make sense! Why is it that they are putting new questions out there that need to be answered, don’t you guys have enough plot holes to answer already? Stop adding new ones! Also how come your turning all the characters into unlikeable pricks? Stop ruining your own characters, they are becoming really annoying and emo!\nReaction 4: Ok, can someone explain why exactly Shinji’s father is such a freaking douche bag? What exactly is his role in all of this? It was said before that he had a plan and everything was in motion but up till now I haven’t seen jack shit! Why is it that nobody dies in this show? Almost every person in this Anime gets caught in an explosion that destroys cities completely but they survive with only minor wounds…what the fuck! The characters may have been good before but up till now I haven’t seen a single character growth. They have all become worse instead, like they de-evolved. Also some characters don’t even get any development at moments when they should and instead of developing them like they should, they are completely forgotten about instead.\nReaction 5: So there are three episodes left and why are they introducing this new guy? Don’t you people think this Anime has enough problems already? Oh wait…so he’s one of those Angel bad guys disguised as a human…and he just died. Am I supposed to feel bad for him? He did infiltrate the base to kill everyone, so now that he’s dead I couldn’t exactly give a shit. Good riddance. But why is Shinji being all emo about it…THE GUY WAS AN EVIL MONSTER THAT TRIED TO KILL EVERYONE! WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE THIS SCENE TENSE AND SAD BECAUSE IT ISN’T!\nReaction 6: TWO EPISODES LEFT AND THEY BETTER START EXPLAINING BECAUSE THIS IS SUCKING SOME SERIOUS ASS!!!\nReaction 7: ………………………what the fuck is going on?\nReaction 8: ARRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! FUCK THIS ANIME, FUCK THIS ANIME!!!!!!!! IT CAN BURN IN SOME DEEP PIT IN HELL!!!!!!!!\n        "},

So, the 'drama', I can't help but to love it, the symbolism and the overall smartness of the show is so captivating that i to this day has yet to find something that gives me the same epic-feelings when i watched it.\nArt: 7/10\nI'll admit it, I'm a very 'new agey'-otaku, I like very pretty art and to be honest the older style don't sit very right with me. But despite this I got used to it pretty quickly and wasn't really bothered by it again.\nSound: 6/10\nI like the opening song, but I never payed much attention to it. (bad me, baaad)\nCharacter 9/10\nI have two characters that i feel should get a special mention, but generally all of the characters in Neon Genesis is interesting and unique.\nI'll start with one of my all-time favorite anime character: Asuka Langley\nVery interesting character. She very much comes across as a playful tsundere but she has a reason! A tsundere with a reason! Yeah! No, but seriously, she's so well written that I can actually relate to her, feel sorry for her and just basically understand her, which i find very difficult with similar characters.\nNext is Shinji Ikari, a character i feel get unnecessary hate a lot of the time. I can agree to the statement that he's a very realistic character, but I find myself wondering, is that really a good thing? Personally, i find Shinji to be a very good change to the usual \"I'll hesitate for five minutes but we all know I'll be doing it\" Who we've all seen. Shinji however struggles between really not wanting to do it (a side-effect of not liking 'the world') and moral standings (he can't just NOT do it, since no one else can) Which to me feels very real. Shinji is not a hero, he's not supposed to be a hero, but it seems many tries to judge him as one.\nEnjoyment: 10/10 and Overall: 10/10\nAll in all, you should definitely watch this as it's one of the best anime's ever made, but remember, it's not an action anime so don't judge it like one.\n        "},

The story was a 8 similar things saw in other anime series so not so exciting. Unless you really get into this stories deep religious symbols you wont find this enjoyable. I gave it a 4 in enjoyment  because there were still fighting between the angles and mecha. There were not really any sound part that did any distinction from any other anime. So overall a 6 for this anime mainly because you could not really get into the show in an enjoyable\n          \n        way.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion was amazing. Even though there were a few things wrong animation wise.\nThe bad. The animation was a bit lacking, I understand that it had a small budget, so I guess that doesn't really hit to hard in the art department. \nThe good. This series told an amazing story with things that you might miss the first time you watch it, this does seem a bit cliche I know, at least when writing an  Evangelion review. But this series takes it so much farther than just having things mentioned early on and then actually put into action later. Neon Genesis Evangelion takes\n          \n        a look into the psyche of the Hideki Anno, the creator of this world. At the time, Anno was depressed due to the lack of support he was having in his life, he wasn't the most popular person at school and his failing career in animation didn't bode to well with is life choices at the moment. Instead of doing something stupid like committing suicide, Anno poored his mind onto paper and created the series we know as Neon Genesis Evangelion. Each of the characters are just as insane as he was at the time, and they are all their own characters for that.\nAnother thing I loved about this series was the characters. Neon Genesis Evangelion didn't have a shortage of Amazing characters. The grief stricken man who wants nothing more than to see his dead wife in the flesh again. A young boy who has had literally no reason for living until this series. The hot headed red head who has a fear of failure. A clone. A crazy cat lady. The girl with daddy issues. The penguin. The angel. This series has a lot of characters that are all unique and all have their own problems. I also think that Shinji has been given way to much hate, the Shinji in this version is a realistic character put into a situation where he has to risk his own life to save the lives of people he hates. Anybody would react in the same way if put in the same situation. The animation isn't horrid either, and the pauses do add to the scenes, though I couldn't appreciate this until I watched Evangelion 1.0. This is also one of those series that you can just sit and think about it and you'll realize things about the series that you never thought about before, there are so many reasons why this series is so debatable, and it's because everybody interprets certain parts in different ways. Even Gendou, the poster man for bad parenting, has moments were he thinks about what he is doing, realizing that it is wrong, but continuing with it because he already made it so far. He realizes that he is a bad parent, adding another layer to his character rather than just \"bad parent\". There is way too much to say about this series as a whole, but rather than I felt very fulfilled when i finished it.\nFinal Verdict:\nIf I could buy this series, i would buy it. Sadly the masses of Evangelion things are the rebuild films, and those really don't do it for me. But regardless, I suggest that you definitely watch Neon Genesis Evangelion.\n10/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    I got sick of having to say \"I havn't seen Evangelion\" especially when I said \"I didn't like evangelion,\" so I finally downloaded it and watched it. Im not a fan of anime cliche's at all, so the first part of the series was extremely hard to get through. Every time that penguin did something unexpected, i just heard legions of anime nerds laughing obnoxiously in my mind. The whole seeing rei naked thing was ridiculous and stupid, and the sweat beads and small eyes when embarassing things happened were awful too. And don't get me started on the happy music. \nI really started to\n          \n        enjoy it around the episode where Asuka showed up. I liked her character a lot, mostly because she doesn't act like a japanese person. After that i had a lot of fun with the series. It was enjoyable, and then became kinda deep and depressing, which was refreshing, since its not cliche and stupid. \nOh, im gonna stick this in here, I've heard a lot of people complain about how big of a bitch shinji is, and I can see that in the first few episodes, but he accepts his duty pretty readily later on in the series. He's not really that big of a bitch, so i can't hate him that much.\nSpoiler free, the ending, which i've heard a lot of people complain about, was .... to say the least, awful. I guess they ran out of money, but they kind of abandoned the entire plot and went in a totally different and stupid direction and didn't resolve anything. The last few scenes don't make sense, and not in a cool \"the world isn't real and everyone is dead\" kind of way that I expected...it's just confusing because it barely relates to anything that has happened. Actually the entire reason I'm writing this review right now is because I hated the ending so much. If you've never seen this, I'd recommend you watch episode 24 and then stop. Nothing happens after that. If you feel like you HAVE to finish the show, go right ahead, but I told you so. \nCongratulations. \n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    Alright, where to begin, Evangelion is sort of like the FF7 of the anime world, it is terribly overrated. I will of course start with the good aspects of the show. As with most gainax productions, art and sound quality are very good, however, these are some of the only things about this show I enjoyed. The story is pretty typical for anime, the world is in danger, and it is up to some random every day teenager to save the day, that is all good and fine, and I am ok with that plot, but Evangelion's problems stem from deeper issues than that. These\n          \n        deeper issues are character development. The characters in Evangelion are just so utterly annoying it makes the show hard to get through. The only thing Shinji is good for is whining, and it isn't like he whines a lot and then eventually accepts his fate and becomes strong-willed. Actually quite the opposite, he whines a lot, and then he whines even more towards the end of the show, it really wears on you after a while. The rest of the characters are so dull, that they don't even really stand out, except when they are whining and crying about how much they hate what they are doing and hate their lives, Rei is the only one who does not do this, but she also seemingly has the least amount of lines in the entire show. On the brighter side, the anime is filled with battles between Angels, which are very cleverly drawn and very unique, and Eva's, that are mysterious Mecha, and this kind of makes up for the characters shortcomings. I am not really going to touch on the \"symbolism\" that people are so fanatical about, because it is insignificant and does not make the show any better or deeper. Overall, I say Evangelion is worth a watch, but it is very far from my favorite show, and very far from my favorite Gainax production.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    For a show that's apparently one of the biggest love-it-or-hate-it-series out there, I had a fairly surprising reaction to it:  I liked it.  I did not love it.  I did not hate it.  I just thought it was OK.\nPerhaps some of that has to do with how I came to this show.  Most people who like the show will tell you that Eva was a brilliant deconstruction of mecha anime, but I didn't know or care about that when I came to the show.  I watched Evangelion in perhaps the worst way possible, without knowing it until later. \n          \n        In short, this was the first mecha anime that I ever watched.  \nIn a way, I feel this was beneficial - it lets me examine Eva as a work in and of itself, without considering what it did or didn't do to the genre.  Instead of pointing out the elements it changed or deconstructed, I can simply look at it as another story.  \nThat story is OK.  The plot and characters are genuinely intriguing, and the hidden depths to the story are enjoyable to look into, but its execution is simply clumsy.  Changes are almost always instantaneous and enormous.  Characters derail more than they develop, a fact which makes it hard to connect with them in a way that would have made the anime great.  Certain characters have motivations so complex that they become incomprehensible and we in the audience cease to care.  \nThis is a show that could have been great, but its many problems keep it from being the masterpiece that so many claim it to be.  Perhaps watching it again now that I have more experience with the genre would yield a different opinion, but as the show stands it is a cast of intriguing personalities handled too ineptly to have the impact that it should.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    *This review takes into account the film, The End of Evangelion. Minor spoilers. Also, not so much a review as it is just a catalog of observations...*\nBleh. Where to begin? It all starts as your average angsty-teenagers-who-must-save-the-world-by-doing-battle-in-giant-robots anime series, then transforms into a touching character study, *then* begins re-purposing concepts from Freudian psychoanalysis, Jewish mysticism, and quantum physics, in the process transforming them into something unrecognizable--all before regurgitating these concepts to examine manic depression, alienation, and the power of subjectivity. (Deep breath.) *On top of which* mecha anime as a genre is *thoroughly* deconstructed, the budget begins to obviously run out toward the end of\n          \n        it all, the last two episodes take place *entirely within the minds of the characters,* and things get decidedly *meta.*\nAnd if that weren't enough, you'll still have to watch The End of Evangelion (comprising two episodes which complement the 'final' two episodes of the series) to get a complete picture of how everything ends, and that opens up a whole new can of worms, not the least of which is the incorporation of live-action filming. If it sounds like a mess, well, yeah, it is. But the series contains scenes of such raw emotional honesty and develops such fascinating and flawed characters that I think the journey is all worth it, and for my money it contains two of the best film sequences I've ever seen: the infamous and brutal 'mind-rape' of Asuka and the 'Come, Sweet Death' climax of The End of Evangelion. Finding other films or series to compare NGE to is difficult--perhaps the works of David Lynch (particularly Eraserhead and Mulholland Dr.), FLCL, and Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey come the closest. Like those films, NGE is not for everyone, but like those films, it's pop avant-garde at its richest. A true landmark in the medium.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This is my very first review on this site, so please bare with me. \nA lot of people have been conflicted over this anime in terms of whether it was 'good' or 'bad'. Those words are very subjective, according to each individual, and don't mean the same to everyone. Here's my breakdown for NGE. \nArt: 10 \nIt's 90s anime! Of course the art isn't the same as anime we see nowadays but after watching more recent titles, I find the artwork for NGE to be refreshing. \nSound: 10 \nAgain, it's 90s anime! The sound effects are awesome. \nStory: \nHere's where the anime shines. The majority\n          \n        of it is action, yes, but it's the last few episodes that change the ballgame and make it what it is. The addition of the last few episodes are what makes some people mad, but it's what I love about the anime. They change the entire storyline and take the plot in a whole new direction, a direction that takes viewers off guard because NGE goes from action to psychological. I have a deep admiration for anime that can take me off guard while still being interesting. \nCharacters: \nNow, the characters are what I love! Each chosen child has an issue of their own. They have problems they have to face, and not all of these problems are easy to deal with. The characters struggle through the storyline with their issues, and prove that a good anime doesn't always have characters that are put together. \nEnjoyment: 10 \nAgain, I truly enjoyed this anime for what it is at first and what it becomes in the end. It has earned my top favorite spot. \n\ntl;dr \nWatch this anime if you are an admirer of psychology, because that's what this anime delves into. It explores the mind of children who have mental issues and exposes these characters for who they are what they go through. I absolutely love stories that go into personal, real issues and that is what NGE does. \nDon't watch if you only want a cardboard cutout story of action. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion is a mindfuck, especially for those who can't pinpoint Biblical references!!! However, if you focus on the characters and their relationships, then this series suddenly becomes golden!!! The animation is shit and the number of still frames where nobody is moving just shows how GAINAX skimped the show to hell and back :( The levity interspersed with the serious bits really made the characters very relatable and profoundly raised the entertainment value of the show!!! Anyone who says this show is shit needs to look themselves in the mirror and see if his or her self-image is shit!!! However, the last two\n          \n        episodes can be skipped as the END of EVANGELION does a much better job in concluding an epic drama like N.G.E. So, this is a must-watch series for any anime fan who enjoys sci-fi, an intricate plot with emotionally complex characters, and a show that explores religious themes thru symbolism. \nNote: The opening theme song was catchy and trash!!! Also, there was too much fanservice used to cover-up shitty animation; that is just my observation after watching the animation quality suffer. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Evangelion is by far one of the best anime I have seen so far. I was first introduced to this series when I saw the second rebuild movie on Toonami in 2013. I have finally gotten around to seeing the full series this year (2016). What this means is that this show has been hyped for me for at least three years. And the hype has still never died down as I continue to learn more about the world of Evangelion. One of my friends watch this anime around the same time and our almost daily discussions about this is about the only thing that\n          \n        gets me through a boring school day.\nThe first thing anyone should now about this show is that it is going to make you work for understanding. If you are not willing to use your brain as you watch this, then just forget about it. It takes a certain type of person to fully enjoy and understand what Evangelion is all about. It takes another type of person would call this pretentious, artsy garbage.\nEvery character is extremely flawed in one shape or another. which is how the psychological aspect of the show. This is not Dragon Ball Z, Yu Yu Hakusho, or FMAB where all the characters are relatively mentally stable and they only need to improve in strength. In Evangelion each character's mental state and decisions in turn effect another character strongly. Out of the all negative reviews of this anime I have read the common thread is that the reviewer did not understand why a character did what he/she did. They forget that this is not a happy show. It focuses heavily on the flaws of humanity. These characters will have regrets and will make mistakes along the way. They are only human after all. \nNow the music in this show is absolutely fantastic. Older pop music for the intro, a beautiful classical score through the show, a several beautiful latin jazz arrangements of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" for the ending, and funk for the preview music. The art, however, due to plenty of budget cuts, is not the best. Evangelion has a look of religious imagery and symbolism. I am not religious at all, but I do appreciate what symbolism is put in. For me, at least, it increases the sense of desperation humans have in Evangelion's world.\nI would not hesitate to say this is easily one of the best anime out there. But you will not agree with me if you do not use your mind. Despite what anyone else says this show does make sense and has meaning. All you need to do is work for it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    In my opinion Evangelion is a good show, is it great? No. Did it blow my mind? In someways yes but mostly no. Evangelion is an uneven show, ranging from mediocre to great to terrible throughout the series, which makes this review rather difficult to do. If I give a show a 7 it means I liked it, I didn't LOVE it but I did like it. I did not like this show however during the first 9 episodes, I thought it was just overreacted. I still think it is, but I can see why so many people love it.\nStory: 7\nThe show is uneven and\n          \n        I really didn't like the first 9 episodes. They were dull and I couldn't get into the story, however after episode 9 was the shows shining point. The show started improve within each episode and I was getting very invested in the story and thought \"Hey! This show is an 8!\" but then the show fell flat after episode.21 . Things just weren't making sense, the animation was horrible with many reused animation shots from previous episodes, still pictures and bad writing. I know they had a low budget don't worry, and it was very noticeable. The shows worst episodes were definitely the last two, which were so pointless and boring, that I was debating whether giving this show a 6 or 7. Its a depressing show and has deep meaning. Episodes 10 through 21 were the shows strong point for me which is why  the story is a 7.\nArt: 6\nNot much I can say, besides the animation was pretty good for its time at the start but near the end due to low budget fell very flat. Reused animation, unfinished animation, and still images. I will say that near the end it held a lot of flashy images which I had to cover my eyes because it was that irritating.\nSound: 9\nSoundtrack is very memorable, especially the opening. The soundtrack compliments Eva very well.\nCharacter: 8\nDespite there being more characters I hate than love, the show has a array of interesting characters with interesting backstories that I would like to know more about. Some backstories do need to be explored more, as there was 1 that didn't really make sense or more so need to be expanded. Character development is there, and not just for the main character quite a few. \nEnjoyment: 7 \nI enjoyed this show. Not the majority of it, but its deep enough that it is memorable for me and I will definitely be watching the movies. Oh yeah, forgot to mention the ending was kind of shit.\nOverall: 7 (Original score) 7.5 (edited score)\nNeon Genesis Evangelion was a difficult anime for me to review, in fact I'm not even sure if overall the show is a 7 for me, but what I do know is that I did like it which is something I didn't think I'd say due to the first 9 episodes. Did I like it? Yes. Did I love it? No. Would I watch it again? Probably not. Do I recommend it? Yes.\nEdit: So it been about a week since I've finished this series and usually series that I give a 7 are series that I don't really think about as much as others. Neon Genesis Evangelion does have its issues but I honestly I think about it a lot. It makes me kind of want to raise the score up.. Okay for me Neon Genesis Evangelion is a 7.5 out of 10. Its not quite an 8 but far to thought provoking to be a 7. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    To be short: is NGE the best anime ever? No. But if you are lucky enough to be intrigued by it... you will never forget about it.\nIf you watch Evangelion with the cold ice of a professional reviewer, it will appear just as an average series, maybe with the merit of trying to experiment and innovate its gender, quite standardized in the middle 90's. \nBut if you move on step back and think at it for its ability to fascinated myriads of fans during the last 30 year and try to understand why, you can’t admit there must be much more over the cover.\nWhat make\n          \n        EVA great, in my opinion, is its internal coherency: but I’m not referring to its plot, it’s philosophical or symbolic plant, or the psychological development of the cast. If you look at each of its point with critical eye, it’s evident that the series fail, less or more, on each of these aspect.\nIt’s coherent because it is basically the history of his creator, and of his reflection, during its fight against depression.\nBut let’s walk with order.\nSTORY: 5__________________\nThis is likely the less criticizable element of NGE, it is quite intriguing and with a lot of back stories, that are used to helps to avoid that some of the “mini twist” of the late part of the series will appear as not to be born from nothing.\nIt look like the story was created using a sort of “inverse engineering” process. As most of you know anime it’s a medium that work with a great use of stereotypies both for gender and characters: school love comedy, harem, mecha, tsundere, yandere etc…\nIt seems that the authors choose what stereotypies want  in their story and construct it to justify the presence of each of these elements. Just if the said: “We want that our hero will be an adolescent having a normal school life, but he must also be the pilot of a giant mecha… etc”, “ok, now lets try to build a story that will bring all of this in a coherent way”.\nIf fact NGE have a solid answer for some of the problem that this stereotypies create for the plot: for example why the pilot of the decisive weapon of humanity should be a 14 year old boy and not an experienced pilot. But fail in other: it is not credible that the pilots will attend a school outside of a military facility, making them potentially non reachable in case of emergency (as happens in one of the episode).\nThe greatest problem with the story is its drastically change of tone during the last 6 episode. Personally I enjoyed it a lot, but if I think at it objectively this is not a plus. \nEvery one of us when is approaching a story, an anime, a film, a book… want to know what kind of story is going to be engaged in. This is not laziness or mental closure. Our time is limited and for this reason is fair that a story will tell us from the beginning what is going to talk about. These does not mean that a story should be monotone. Let’s take for example Madoka Magica. It is a story that change a lot, the tone of the first episode is completely different to the last, but this evolution is somewhat announced from the beginning: the initial dream of Madoka and the visual style of the story announce what will be happening. When the story is ended most of the people watching it will think: I will never imagine that, but it is exactly the sort of think I’m waiting from this story!\nIn NGE this tone change is driven by the emotional status of his director and the financial issue that GAINAX had to managed. It is absolutely not prepared. I repeat, I loved it, but I’m just one of the few people that having be engaged by a SCI-FI mecha story is not angered by the fact that this is substantially  abandoned and transformed in a psychological story, until to evolve to its controvert ending.\nIf most watcher are annoyed but this it is not their fault, it is a story fault!\nBut if you are lucky to be like me, it will be incredible amazing even for you!\nAnimation: 7______________\nThe problem with NGE animation is its discontinuity. There are moment of great and enjoyable animation (most of the battles in the first half of the series) and moment where it is poor or even absolutely absent.\nThis alternation is due to the lack of resource of GAINAX, and the director managed to transform this problem in a strength. In some case it work very well: for example the famous long scene in the elevator with Asuka and Rey where nothing move for about 60 seconds. It create a great sense of tension, and in fact it was retaken in the same way in the second rebuild film (where certainly there was not lack of money), but it doesn’t obtain the same effect.\nAs with the story the problem is the ambiguity that NGE show to the watcher: it create the expectation to be an action series, for this reason some people can be bothered by this moment of poor animation. But, at difference of what happens with the story, this alternation is showed since the beginning of the show, giving you the opportunity to understand quickly if this modality work for you or not.\nMusic: 8_________________\nThe music in NGE is at an average good level. If you loved the series, the opening will be legendary for you, but the same should be said for most of anime series out there.\nCuriosity: the main battle teme is copied from a James bond film, but this does not make it less enjoyable.\nIn my opinion there is a gem inside the music track of NGE, a piece called “Thanatos If I Can't Be Yours”. This is an amazing melody, used wisely by the director only in 2 crucial moment. You can found easily an orchestra version of this music. Try to listen it, if you like melting melodies it will worth your time.\nCharacters: 5_______________\nThis is one of the most controversial thing in Evangelion. The most common critiques is that the entire cast is somewhat monochrome. All of them are mentally sick, and almost everyone in the same way, and this is true because essentially every character is a different aspect of the director.\nIt is possible to say the same think to some of the Woody Allen film, but there is a huge difference: Woody Allen theoretical knowledge of modern psychoanalysis is unexceptionable, and this repletion of the main character obsession on the secondary is used in a conscious way to the fine of the message he want to tell.\nIn Evangelion this fact is absolutely instinctive and should appear grotesque. At the end of the story it is a lucky consequence that this aspect is perfectly coherent with one of EVA message: we cannot know other people for what they are but just for what they think they are, so we tend to reflect in others our sickness.\nThis is the kind of internal coherence I was talking about at the beginning. Even if not intentional , quite fascinating.\nDirection: 5________________\nThe high and low of all the aspect of EVA are exasperated in the question related to the direction and dialogues.\nThere are scene absolutely amazing like the kiss scene of episode 15 (one of the best episode in my opinion). In these scene there is a lot of backstory but everything will evolve in a very natural way, obtaining a good comical effect while telling a much darker truth in his background.\nIn the same episode there is a dialogue between 2 of the main cast element. One of them explain the reasons she choose to cut their relation some time before: the dialogue is excessive, with she explaining word by work what it’s going on in her mind, obtaining a grotesque effect, like a little child that is trying to behave like an adult.\nThe choice to add reference to religious and philosophical concept here and there to give the story a sense of profundity it is not bad (any story should at this best try to obtain a sense of profundity, due to its fictional nature, real profundity can came only by its not fictional elements) but it would have required a more prepared set of writer to use it in a completely effective way. It use is too instinctive, and the watcher should be bothered founding  it superficial.\nAgain: there is a profound coherence between the philosophical and psychological references and the story, but this is not intentional and this is evident.  \nIn conclusion_________________:\nIf reality is not  cognizable, the only portion of truth that is accessible to our conscience is our self, so the only possibility for any one of us to tell something that is the more possible near to truth is tell something about our self. Anyone who is enough brave, or crazy, to put a piece of himself into a story without censor anything, will create something that worth to be engaged with.\nIt’s simply this what Hanno did whit Neon Genesis Evangelion, and is for this reason that many people love its work. Starting from this love, any discussion about the philosophical link of NGE, or the psyche of its cast, or its symbology will be interesting, because will be a discussion based on a real life experience, otherwise will be just an intellectual game that will be better to play starting from more accurate and less rough piece of art. \nThank you for reading and I hope to not have bothered you with my terrible english!\n        "},

Such imperfections would be critical to any other anime/movie/book/(insert your media). But Evangelion is truly a special snowflake.\nIt compensates its flaws with outstanding achievemnts in animation and sound. This, to me, outweighs its story problems big time. The angles and pacing of scenes, as well as lighting and overall visual flow should be compared to the levels of cinematography by Fellini or Kubrick.\nThe cries of Evangelion units, and the sound of tight rubber straining in the middle of the fight - is otherworldly and plain simply cool-sounding.\n          \n        The music is memorable, shifting through different moods of the show rather gracefully. The voice acting (I watched in Japanese) was also at a high level. All the main characters are easily recognizable by their voices that suit them perfectly.\nCharacter writing is also great. All of them act and feel like human beings who are unclear of their future. The main character, Shinji, clearly evolves through the show - just not in a way you expect him to. To me, it's still a positive growth for a very faulty human being, but some other viewers saw it as a disappointment. \nThere are also beautiful romantic side-stories to Evangelion that are often overlooked. They also make Evangelion very moviesque - again, a very unique quality for a TV show.\n\"The depression\" part of Evangelion starts rather late in the show. The first 18 episodes are full of intelligent action and humor.\nThere is a serious tone of realism to Evangelion - but it's still an anime. The story has its plot holes, which you may not see in your first watch. If you want to completely understand everything - you won't be able to. The \"lore\" of this anime is very, very messy. But it's still thrilling and quite original.\nIf you enjoy beautiful cinematography, unusual post-apocaliptic landscapes, fast-paced mecha action with screaming - this is a must-watch.\nAnd it is also a hugely influential, landmark anime, so go watch it anyway.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    There's so much going on in Evangelion that it's hard to write a complete analysis of it. You could talk about it as a genre deconstruction, a psychological character-study, or a commentary on human nature and they'd all be valid interpretations. It's fascinating.\nI'd say that it's the latter two that are really important. For all its crazy imagery and plot elements, Evangelion is really a story about its characters. They're all complex people who are ultimately just trying to be happy but don't really know how to go about it. It deals with very real, human pain and difficulty and it's genuinely relatable and touching.\n          \n        But as depressing as it is, it still ultimately ends on a positive message and that's easy to appreciate.\nOn top of all that it's just really cool. The designs for both the Evas and the Angels are excellent and the fight scenes in particular are amazing. They're varied, memorable, and disturbing. They work really well at supporting the overall tone of the series and individual scenes. The religious symbolism and naming are included for no reason besides that they're cool, but the fact remains that they ARE cool. \nWhat I'm getting at is that even if you don't care about the deeper themes or other more difficult aspects of the show Evangelion is still really good. That's another thing that makes it so impressive to me.\nIt's not perfect, it's a bit of a mess and some of the plot elements don't get explained. At all. But it's such a well-directed, artistic work that any flaws seem irrelevant, vastly overshadowed by how much it does right. It's very human, exciting, and occasionally profound. If you have any interest in anime at all, you really should give it a shot."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most popular classic anime ever. It's been popular ever since it started all away back in 1995. But why is this? One of the biggest reasons for this is because of the wonderful character development and beautiful story that make NGE one of the best anime of all time. During the series you see Shinji slowly fall into a deep dark depression and the sadness all around him. Not just that but there are a great amount of amazing supporting character that make the show that much better.There are cons with the show such as the terrible animation\n          \n        in some of the later episodes, some random 2 minute pauses in some episodes and of course the ending. Yes, the ending is AWFUL, but that didn't stop me from loving the series. If you are thinking about watching NGE, I would recommend to skip episodes 25 and 26 and to just go and watch End of Evangelion. Nonetheless, Neon Genesis Evangelion is an incredible anime that will always be one of my favorite.\n        "},

There's most of things you can hate in anime. Whiny characters. Yaoi (many people don't like it). Threads that don't make any sense and are NEVER EVER explained even briefly. For example, ending. I'll try not to spoil anything. Ending is bad. Whole two last episodes of main character whining, and whining, and whining, and you have no idea what's up, because there's only ONE hint what's happening, and it... doesn't make ANYTHING clear. Some people call it art. Well, I can splash paint at the floor, and\n          \n        then call it art. And it will be art. I can think of some deep meaning to this, but it'll still be just splashed paint. I won't say there aren't any enjoyable moments in this anime. I think that more than half of time I spent with it was enjoyable. But the end and few other episodes around 12th just broke, shattered and tossed away any good feeling I had watching the series. Let me quote youtuber with a nick gigguk: \"It's like you have a feeling for some women, and she have feeling for you, and then you discover she has a dick. She can be the most sexy person in the world. She can love you like none other. But this all can't ignore the fact she has a dick.\" Anyway, let me warn you for the last time: Evangelion isn't very enjoyable series. The only reason you'd want to wotch it is to be one of people that watched Evangelion.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    Disclaimer: I am writing this review before I have seen the movie, this is a review for the show and I do not wish for the movie to alter it even if it is supposedly the true ending. Now that that's out of the way onto the review.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion (NGE for short) is a very well known classic, much like Akira, Cowboy Bebop, ext... It's also no secret that this show holds a high position in the world of anime, considered by many of those \"anime pro's\" to be a complete masterpiece and one of the pinicles of anime and anyone who hasn't seen\n          \n        it or doesn't think it's the greatest thing since slice bread isn't a real anime fan. Well frankly I'm fine with not being one of those \"real anime fans\" because they're a bunch of elitist pricks, I'm not saying the show is bad, simply overrated. \nStory 8/10: The story of NGE is that there was an event called the second impact that melted the polar ice caps and killed a fuck ton of people, about 14 years later alien beings called \"angels\" whom there are 17 (or 18, wasn't completely keeping track) start invading one at a time and it's the job of pilots of Eva's (big mechs) to kill them. How do we know there's 18/17 before they all show up? The dead sea scrolls of course! Needless to say the show has a lot of religion involved, anyway starting the show I honestly could not pin why people were say it was such a mind fuck psychological master piece as at first it starts out as a very standard mech show. There's two points to make about this, the first being that yes, much later into the show (around 14-16 episodes) things do start getting a little more thinky-thinky, the problem is it takes far too long to get into it, as by the time you do get into the 16th episode the new psychological aspect seems completely out of place in the already established tone of the show. Now as for the actual second half, it starts of a little introductory psychology 101 and descends into what would happen if Sigmund Freud snorted LCD laced cocaine off of a poster of David Lynch's movie \"Eraserhead.\" And despite being almost impossible to understand by the time you get to the last few episodes it's still very good compared to a lot of other shit on the market. \nArt 6/10: I have a rule when it comes to art in anime, I don't care if you do look dated if you are an old show, that will have no effect on the review, however if you use the extremely standard templates for the characters and nothing original in the background you're getting a very average 5. So why did I give this show a 6? Why the mind fuck sequences of course! When you're getting into a crazy mind fuck sequences you have to make what's going on on screen just as erratic and crazy as the dialogue, which NGE does quite well, especially the handful of episodes where I could swear the animation just keeps getting more vague as it goes along. Gold star for some originality NGE... Well not much of a gold star but you're slightly above average, not everyone can say the same.\nSound 9/10: Okay, if there is one part of NGE that truly does deserve recognition as a \"master piece\" it's the absolutely beautiful music. The opening is often hailed as one of the best openings of any anime, the ending is always a variation of the (made famous by Frank Sinatra) song \"Fly Me To The Moon\" sung by several different singers depending on the episode, and the in show itself the music ranges everywhere from slow and somber to fast and energetic, original pieces and very well known songs (like \"Ode to joy\"), ext... And though it's impressive when the songs are used in scenes where they fit perfectly, what's more interesting is when they're used out of where you would think they would be. With many other shows an out of place song would distract from the scene, but somehow here they managed to use in such a way that rather from taking away from the scene they actually give it a very interesting and unique feel, it's just amazingly done. Now as for the dub... It's okay, it's not the greatest thing ever but unless you're a hardcore weeaboo who believes the English language should never have existed (need I remind you it's the language you speak?) you'll have no problems what-so-ever. \nCharacter 8/10: People often say the characters are the best part of NGE, while I do disagree I will say the characters are done well so long as they don't have the last name \"Ikari.\" At first the characters appear fairly one dimensional, Asuka is the standard tsundere, Rei is... Kind nothing, Ikari (the head of nerv, not Shinji) is a prick. But later into the series all these characters seem to get far more intricate, Asuka is a girl attempting to avoid her own fears of being ignored due to a troubled past involving her mother, Rei is struggling for identity as she realize she fears death and loneliness, and Ikari... Is still a prick, and several other characters also get quite a lot of fleshing out near the end. The show makes a point of making sure you know that all the characters are broken on the inside when all's said and done, they aren't all perfect people who take death easily, they all have their own personal trauma's and struggles... Except Ikari, who is merely a prick. And Shinji, who is kind of indecisive bitch who runs away at every opportunity, decides at the last minute not to run away, and then spends the next two episodes bitching about things that easily would have changed if he just fucking got on the train. \nEnjoyment 8/10: The show may not be a master piece but it is still very entertaining, whether you like fast paced mech action or are more into the thinking type of psychological drama you'll find something to like about this show. \nOverall 8/10: Alright, so definitely not the greatest thing since sliced bread that the elitist \"real anime fans\" all make it out to be but the show is not bad. A good story combined with (some) very well written characters and of course an amazing OST make this a very good show well worth the watch even if it does start off a little... Meh. \n        "},

I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.” \n“And can one observe that one's going mad oneself?” \n“I imagine one can't see oneself clearly in such circumstances,” Alyosha answered with surprise. \n--- Brothers Karamazov\n\nThere is a moment when Shinji goes to the hospital to see Asuka after her “mental rape”; she has IV lines everywhere, she may even have been intubated at one point. She looks like\n          \n        death. Shinji is having flashbacks of memory powered by some intense emotion, maybe guilt or shame or pity, and it’s creating a conflict in his skinny body. When he comes back to himself, he finds he has masturbated in Asuka’s hospital room, practically at her death bed. He is revolted at himself. Okay, this is the moment when it’s evident that the writer/creator is having a schizophrenic break from reality. I reiterate: the brilliant man is not well. This is not some bad trip, this is not a burst of creative genius. You are witnessing the convulsive mental emesis of a sick man.  \nIt follows then that the story should prove a fragmented thing: it begins auspiciously and masterfully, with a strong narrative and complicated character development which is second to none; it ends in what looks like some primordial liquid with Shinji fused in the nether-regions to Rei. (Or was it Asuka? Does it matter?)\nShinji is brought by the reckless Misato to Nerv, where he will serve as one of the pilots for an Eva; there are three Eva Units, giant modified fighting beings which prove frightening in ways that go well beyond appearances. When he joins Nerv, Shinji is 14; his father, Commander Ikari, is cold and calculating, capable of terrible rationalizations instrumental to humanity’s effort to withstand the Angels. Angels are bizarre organisms determined to find Adam and end sentient life on earth. Misato is the closest thing to a mother that poor Shinji knows; she can’t cook, she drinks too much beer, and drives like a homicidal maniac. But she does have a heart, though it’s to her detriment. Shinji’s “mates” are Rei and the aforementioned Asuka (I won’t even attempt to discuss Kaworu). Rei is a mish-mash of spare parts, explaining her schizoid personality. Asuka is arrogant and frequently overbearing, but she is still a child, and ultimately vulnerable. In fact, all the children and teenagers are damaged, and so, it would seem, is their creator. You can hide Tokyo 3 within the bowels of the earth; you can stop all motion in order to broadcast Schiller’s words in the chorus (“Freude!”) from Beethoven’s Symphony No 9; you can even change the ending “without a trace of irritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity”; it still isn’t enough to allow a mere mortal to see one’s own madness with God-like clarity. \nI'll give a 10 for the beginning, but this doesn’t count as a review. I don’t give grades to the mentally ill; I bring them flowers and a hope-you-get-well card. If I were as pure as Alyosha, I would probably pray for their souls, too. \n"},

I think it was one of my first anime series I have ever seen. (to be more exact it was second or third one if I don't count Pokemon and Digimon of course ^_^) On of the first ones and yet the best and my favorite one.  \n______________\nWhat is it about?\nI am not going to speak about story which was by the way very good not to mention amazing action scenes and very cool characters which you are not going to forget. At first it seemed like ordinary science-fiction but\n          \n        few episodes later it changed a bit. Actually it twisted upside down in the end and almost everything seemed totally different than before. But as I said story is not the most important thing here. I am always looking for some deep thoughts in every anime I watch. I actually choose anime by that. Well, NGE was like a treasure for me. \n______________\nDeep thoughts\nYou can notice during the first episodes that something is slowly coming. Later there are really mind blowing scenes going on in main hero's head. I think that a lot of people went through something similar especially during maturing and puberty. There are really interesting questions appearing. (Why should I continue doing what I do right now or even why should I continue living this life? What about everyone around? Are they even there? etc.)  Some episodes in the second half are really forceful and as one of my friend said: “My mind was near to exploding.” However if you watch carefully and think about it a bit, you can realize that some of the thoughts are very similar to something you know. Something you was trying to solve too or you just ran away from it and hid that somewhere deep in your subconscious. (Or unconscious? Whatever...) \n______________\nResult\nI don't want to write long review because I don't like it myself when the reviews and almost longer than the whole anime subtitles and this anime deserves not to read about it but to watch it. As I said I am looking for deep thoughts anime and I have never seen better anime than this one. Everyone can find his own interpretation of everything in there and everyone can find part of himself in there.  NGE is definitely the most valuable piece of Japanese animation and every otaku or just anime fan should watch it. (I actually plan rewatch sometimes and It must be said that I never watch anime twice or more times.)\nPS: Don't watch all those NGE remakes (the films I mean). It is just business trick to literally mine as much money as we can from the good name of NGE. Only film worth watching is The End of Evangelion. (A bit mindblowing too and it is ending of the whole plot.) \n        "},

Then the main character, he's a calm person generally and isn't as obnoxious as the other characters, he's the opposite of Asuka basically. Other side characters were introduced near the end of the anime, such as the very beloved Kaworu Nagisa. He didn't receive much screen time to say.\nEnjoyment: Well, I did enjoy one of the episodes more than the others. But overall I did enjoy most of everything except for Asuka, who's annoying voice is everywhere. \nOverall: I wish the creators didn't make the ending so repetitive and useless to the main plot of the story.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    I'll be honest. I'm one of those people who first heard of this anime from various memes from it's opening. Upon first watching watching it 3 to 4 months ago (on an illegal stream site because dammit they don't have this anime on Neflix, Crunchyroll, Funimation and/or VRV) I definately liked it but I am a little salty about a few things. This review IS by my memory reviewing a 26 episode long anime that's around 20-25 years old that I've only seen though once (and a half) so don't take is review for granted.\nStory:\nThe story is good assuming you can comprehend it. The concept\n          \n        is that angels are attacking humanity and the japanese government needs the help of 3 anxey teens to pilot giant mecha robots known as Evas to fight against the angels and hope for the best (hmm kinda like Attack On Titan with Gundam elements now that I think about it) Don't think that the story is gonna be like a fun battle shounen that you can turn your brain off and enjoy. It's anything BUT that! The story can get extremely complicated and confusing as fuck if your not paying close attention and there's a fuck load of phsylogical moments and religious symbolism is pretty much everywhere. (Some of them aren't very subtle if your a religious person)\nMaybe it's just me but there were some episodes that to me felt a bit pointless. They're not fillers but sometimes the story goes nowhere to me and that ending is utter garbage in my opinion.\nArt:\nIt looks alright for a 1995 anime. The animation is very limited and there were a lot of times when animation would be non existent. Seriously sometimes all you see is one still frame for a good 15 seconds and unless the characters are talking to each other, these moments can feel very awkward. At least the visuals themselves look pretty tho... up until the last episode. A lot of anime do get worse in animation and visuals in later episodes but here, it just felt like all of the budget was thrown out the window. At least 25 out of 26 episodes look decent enough.\nAlso Sega Saturn sponsorship!\nSound:\nOne thing I fucking love about this show is the opening. Memes aside, the opening theme is fucking awesome! It perfectly sets the mood of the whole show, starting a little eerie but overtime getting a little more catchy and flashy. The in show music is, just there. It definately makes some of the EVA vs angels fights tense but overall, they are just kind of... there. For the sake of having an easier time to comprehend the story I watched Evangelion dubbed so for english voice acting, it is a little off. almost as if the delivery for some characters weren't quite right. I can forgive it for this anime cuz it's a 90s anime and back then, The only well known anime that had good English dubs in my opinion were Dragon Ball Z, Yu Yu Hakusho and Cowboy Bebop. Professional dubs weren't much of a thing back then especially considering 4kids was the dominant anime dubber at the time.\nCharacters:\nOne pulberizing character in the whole series is non other than the main character, Shinji Ikari! He's as natorious for being one of the worst anime protagonist as Kirito from SAO. Unlike Kirito tho, I don't think Shinji is that bad. I mean yeah he's winey as fuck but if I was in the position he was in, I probably would hate myself too. Imagine being a 14 year old who's forced by your fatcher who doesn't give a shit about your existence suddenly giving you a task that is crucial to human kind and if you fail, you pretty much doomed all of humanity. I would want to kill myself!\nAs for the other characters, Well Rei has a cool backstory but lacks personality imo, Asuka is fucking annoying, Misato is probably my favorite Evangelion character, Shinji's father is unlikeable but intentionally so idk how to feel about him, I also like the 2 classmate characters and that blond chick with glasses is cool I guess.\nOverall: I don't quite agree with the notion that Evangelion is 'da best anime ever'. The plot can be unneedingly convoluted, the visuals ran into a brick wall by the last episode and the some characters are unlikeable.  That being said, I do consider Evangelion a good/great anime. Even if the story is convoluted, there is a lot of meat to the story with the correct mindset, the music can range from okay to amazing and the characters definately feel very realistic. (unlikeable or not.)\nIf your looking for a mecha anime with phsyological aspects, religious symbloism and realistic characters and you can shrug off the okay to subpar visuals, I highly recommend Evangelion to you. Availabilty is a little stingey because at the time of this review, Evangelion has yet to be available in a legit video streaming service. You'll have to either buy a physical DVD/Blu Ray collection copy or view it on an illegal streaming site like Kissanime or 9anime.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    At this point, what could I possibly say about Neon Genesis Evangelion that hasn't been said before? this is what happens when a piece reaches such impact, fame, and of course, controversy, you just don't know where to start... Oh, and the fact that the reviewer you're reading is talking 20 years after it was released may have something to do with his lack of originality, but making all this aside, I'm going to try.\nEvangelion is sitting in a Golden Throne for many. Several times, people overrate what they see, but this is not the case. Eva is where it is because good reasons. From\n          \n        its very base, it shows a great originality and I have to clap Hideaki Anno. He managed to take the Christian genesis and turn it into a really complex and exceptionaly well threaded science fiction story which involves many, many matters of philosophy, psychology, human relations and self-improvement, all this accompanied by the most epic mecha battles. But which is even more important than the exquisite premise and which gives the series its identity, is the presentation of this premise. Just like its contest, the approaching is completely different from everything seen before (and different from most of what would come later), this anime is not an excursion, besides a great deconstruction of the mecha genre and narrative formulas (like that of the \"monster of the week\"), it is a puzzle and they throw you the pieces for you to complete it. Instead of having coarse and long dialogs explaining everything that's going on, you have subtle dialogs and step-by-step revelations, and it's up to you to get all that information to make sense.\nMany hate the series (and the movie) for that reason, accusing it for being confusing and pretentious because of the \"useless\" symbolysm, but the truth is that being confusing is not a reason to say something is bad, it only means you have to put that head to work, strive to think out-of-the-box and understand, that's the only way to catch the plot and the messages it gives, and that's something glorious. You'll need to watch Evangelion two, three, four times, but if you really pay attention and interpret what you watch, you'll see everything clear and the symbolysms are there to help you.\nOther thing that makes some people hate Evangelion, are the characters. Most of them, if not all, are detestable people full of serious mental issues, so if you're the kind of viewer who likes to get into hollow characters like if they were mere containers to live the story by yourself, well, this is not for you. Eva characters are not likeable at all and you'll not want to identify with them, but they're not supposed to be likeable, they're people in a disastrous world and have lived disastrous lifes, and they act as well. They're not receptacles for you, they're their own persons who have their own stories, personalities, issues and way of being, and just as the story, they're puzzles and you'll most to know them and think to understand them, just like you'll most do the same with real people, they're, redundancy apart, terribly realistic. They're one of the first tri-dimensional characters and probably the most complex you'll see in anime, another of the many things Evangelion was a pioneer, another of the reasons why this series marked a before and after on the anime industry. And of course, just like every good character most, Eva characters grow and change throughout the events, but not in the way you'd expect. Don't get surprised if they get sicker episode after episode, that's not rare seeing how sick they were from the begining and how sick the events they have to live are. And also, that's how depression (one of the most important issues this series deals with) works. You slowly fall deeper and deeper, and when you're at the bottom, then you kill yourself, or you start to slowly improve yourself instead.\nThe battles, another of the so memorable things this anime has, are not only battles, they accompain the development of story and characters in a really exceptional way, so they're not only epic and brutal, they're also significative. The epic of the fights is due also to the animation. Because of the lack of time and budget, there're several times when the animation fluctuates in quality (although never losing the high detail level), the animators preferred to focus on the treatment of action, and they made it magnifiscently. You can feel the strenght of every hit and the angle and movement of the planes will make you feel tiny in front of the struggles of those massive monsters the Evangelions and the Angels are, each scene is really powerful, and the soundtrack (which is from one of the best composers in the anime industry) really accompains, just like it does on every situation.\nThis is not about opinions or tastes, being the most objective I can be, to my judgement, we'll hardly see anything come close to Neon Genesis Evangelion and The End of Evangelion. Without any doubt, one of the best animes on history. 10/10.\n        "},

Everywhere I go when it involves anime, I always hear about this one. I got into anime about six years ago. I started with Adult Swim, with shows like Cowboy Bebop, Fooly Cooly, and Gundam Wing. But one of the animes I never watched was Evangelion, it just didn't really catch my interest. Then, just over two years ago, I decided to watch because of the reputation it had for being so great and controversial. So I watched it, finished it, and I got to say,\n          \n        I have mixed feelings about it. \nThe story is of a group of pilots who their Evangelion's. giant human-like macha's who battle an evil race of alien called angels. The angels come back to earth for a second time, and the pilots have a new recrute, Shinji Ikari, who's father is head of NERV, the base where the Evangelion were created. Shinji, along with a handful of other teenagers, battle the angels to save earth once more. \nNeon Genesis Evangelion is a really hard anime to write about. There is so much mythology behind it. Lets start with the main character, Shinji, I usually don't like anime that don't have main characters I like or can't connect with. Shinji seemed weak and to fragile, I understand that a lot of scary stuff happened to him, but in the minced of war, you have to keep your head held high, and be as strong as you can be. Shinji wasn't this, which made the chemistry better between him and the girl pilot, Langley a great match, and one of the best, and most tragic things about the series. Evangelion is a sci-fi anime wrapped in the horror of war, that is seen through the eyes of teens. Which makes it so gruesome as we see kids getting hurt, and even mutilated. its a horrible sight to see, but you won't see it in any other anime. Which makes Evangelion stand out above others, but also makes it a risk to watch. \nAll in all, I don't recommend this anime to  anybody, I recommend it to everybody. You won't find an anime out there like this, which is both good and bad. If you watch Evangelion, and you either become a huge anime fan, or you are so repulsed that you never watch anime again, at least you saw this one.  \n        "},

Perhaps they were trying to dig too deep into into all the psychological aspectshe of this anime series . In my eyes, it was the worst ending possible.\nEither way, NGE looks good, and the characters get to evolve a little too. Most of them don't go too \"overboard\", either (a side to anime that\n          \n        I'm yet to get accustomed to).

At first glance a seemingly stupid question, till you really get involved with it. If you go on to talk about the physics of it you could actually discuss this question for awhile, but if a kid asks it, the answer is a simple yes, leave me alone. \nThe main premise: a boy is made to fight aliens, though he believes himself to be worthless and is battling depression (never stated but pretty sure it was implied). Every episode is set up with care, a battle with the aliens progressively gets worse and brings\n          \n        about a poor emotional reaction from the main character, but he struggles through and survives.

I however, have a tendency to go into fits of introspection and retrospection, which makes that time pretty easy to deal with. This is of course what brings me to doing this review. And surprisingly, the fact that it is not present can be what turns a person away from the series.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is a pretty popular series among anime fanboys, not so much now as it was in the nineties but the point still\n          \n        remains. Because of its popularity, it has two very dominant viewpoints; those who adore it, and those who find it atrocious, that is not to say there is no middle ground, but that's not the point of this review. What I will now do is examine one of the series I formally consider one of my top anime. So without further ado, let's begin.\n\nStory:\nAmongst the two prominent views of NGE, you'll find that the fans love it because it's supposedly deep, and that the haters hate it because it's incredibly not. The truth of the matter is that both parties are wrong, and fail to realize that there is middle ground, for fans, I'll elaborate later but for haters, I'll elaborate now. While NGE isn't the type of story that has you on the edge of your seat, worrying about the welfare of the characters, there are particularly enjoyable moments that can leave you with a smile. When it's not wrought with angst, NGE is an amusing show that can leave you satisfied on a few occasions. The problem however, is that there is a story there but because of bad characterization, it can go unnoticed. This is what makes the haters wrong in say that it's not deep, NGE is in fact layered, but unfortunately, it forces you to go through several feet of concrete before you find the layers.\n\nArt:\nConsidering what I know about this series, I have to say that the art is pretty good for its time. Again, like the story, it won't take your breath away but in all twenty-six episodes it doesn't manage to break. NGE can't be compared to the work of Shinkai Makoto or Hayao Miyazaki in scenery porn, but it doesn't do bad for what it has.\nSound:\nConsidering the solemn and grave mood of the series, and the particularly angst ridden characters the sound track is actually very likable. I can't exactly explain why Fly me to the moon, of Frank Sonatra fame is used as the ending theme, but it should be a testament to the quality of the music. One episode even show classes this with a choreographed fight, synced with classical ballad. It's not Yoko Kanno in the slightest, but the sound track is far from awful\nCharacter:\nAs I mentioned in the story part of this review, fans and haters have opposing opinions that don't have any middle ground. While haters are wrong to say that the story lacks any depth, fans are just as at fault to say that the characters are anymore than what they are. To be fair, the reason I initially liked this series is because of the look into Shinji's mind but what subtracts from a rather interesting concept, in a field where most anime characters are one dimensional (more so now than then) is the fact that there's no character development. It is clear from the beginning that Shinji has problems but he is never seen coming to terms with them. Some may say that the original ending was actually meant to do that, but that's arguable, and even if they are right there are still other characters in the show. While diving into Shinji's psyche is an intriguing concept, it doesn't do us any good when he, like others, is one dimensional. The earlier parts of the show actually tried to resolve this with him becoming less angsty and more arrogant through constant victories, but he still suffers his overwhelming emo appearance, that is unfounded considering his connections with at least Misato, who provides a rather stable home. Shinji, as well as the other pilots Rei and Asuka, are the embodiments of the archetypes that were used to construct them, and because of that, they never manage to escape their clutches. This is to say nothing of the other characters.\nEnjoyment:\nDespite my view on the characters, I originally watched this at a time when I was less critical, and to be fair, you have to be like this if you want to enjoy it. While you don't have to throw away your brain like you do when watching senseless dribble that can be called Moe, you will have to turn it down some  in order to over look the characterization. Because this was made at a bad time in GAINAX's life, it's done badly and it doesn't help that director Hideaki Anno was going through psychological problems of his own. When going into this anime note that, and you'll be able to milk a bit of enjoyability from it, if you don't get out right annoyed by the characters first.\n\nOverall:\nTo say this series is without problems would be to cast delusion onto yourself, but to say it is the epitome of crap would be to ignore what exists in today's anime community. If anything makes Evangelion bad, it is that its two lesser concepts take away from each other. The angels are apart of the plot, but they aren't nearly as important as the characters themselves and because the characters don't seem to grow, it's easy to go through this series and find no merit. \nWhile I've seen my share of anime that are significantly better than this, I've seen an equal share that is completely worse and for that reason my final judgement is that this series gets a 6 out of 10."},

A lot less so after you have watched \"The end of Evangelion\", but still a mess.\nCharacter	\nThis is character development at its best. The characters are all likable in their own ways, and throughout the episodes they all get plenty of time to grow. There is a lot of angst in all of them, and it gets worse and worse the further you watch. It becomes clear in the end that this anime is not really about action, it's about human nature.

They shifted more towards fanservice and psychology towards the end. And unfortunately, I hate both. Moreover, they left many things either unexplained or gave very little reasoning for them towards the end.\nThe art and sound was very nice considering the year when it was made. It had very nicely detailed designs for all the EVAs and the angels. The NERV HQ was also quite well designed. The scenes of the battles between the EVA and the angels were the best part. The graphics and sound in those made the quite realistic.\nHowever, the main flaw with this series were the characters. There wasn't a single 'likeable' character in this series. The protagonist, Ikari Shinji spent more time crying and running away than piloting the EVA(which he was really good at). The second pilot, Asuka kept lamenting on losing to Ikari Shinji in terms of skills with piloting the EVA. The 3rd pilot, Ayanami Rei, never spoke. And when she did, it was always, \"Who am I? What am I? Who are you?\" and stuff like that. Among the older characters, Misato and Ritsuko were again lamenting about the past almost 40% of the time. The only sane characters out there were probably Ikari Gendou and Kozo Fuyutsuki.\nSince the last few episodes were just soliloquies of the characters and that those where they just kept wondering \"Who am I? Who are you? Why am I alive? What is Eva?\", the series became very very boring. \nOverall, unless you are a die-hard fan of mecha or you like psychological stuff  , there is absolutely no reason to waste your time watching this when there are many better animes out there.\n        "},

At the beginning it does not start out like that based on the episodes, in which, we are reminder of a Power Ranger show. \nHalfway through the show, the  wife of the director of the anime of that time suddenly dies. There you suddenly see a notable shift in the series. Almost everyone is undergoing some sort of depression. Sure there is the notable one namely Shinji who many people despise because of his indecisiveness, but you soon realizes that everyone still has problems and this emotional aspect are affecting\n          \n        their life in one way or another.\nNeon Genesis is a based on a era where large gundam robots are created in order to guard these beings known as angels from fusing with a biological organism in Japan. To top it off, they can only be piloted by 14 year olds consisting of a boy in depression, very overconfident and brash girl and another who barely speaks or reveal her emotions. \nWhile it is an anime that I would recommend due its great storytelling and great animation back at its time, it is not for the faint hearted due to the emotional roller coaster that it will take you halfway in. There are many key themes to explore and continuously ask certain characters what is the purpose of living.\n        "},

Gave the public an amazing story, with realistic characters\n          \n        and situations, and prove than the action series with teenager main characters can be mature and depth. This is why the show had the impact it had.\nWhy is still relevant?

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    \"Mankind's greatest fear is Mankind itself\" -Gendo Ikari\nTo be honest, I'm not really interested in old animes. It's not like I have anything against them but the art sometimes gets on my nerves (sorry to people who disagree with my opinion). However, Neon Genesis Evangelion opened a new world to me. I didn't think I would make it in the beginning but an important saying reached me: \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\" The focus of this anime shouldn't be the art, in fact, I became addicted to the soundtracks. I observed characters and changed my perspectives. At the end, I have to declare\n          \n        that this was one of the most mind-blowing animes I have ever seen. The creators added so much themes behind the story and adding a dark psychological background. Now the official review shall begin:\nStory: Hideaki Anno really increased the dark themes in this anime. On the surface, it may seem like a bunch of teenagers fighting with robots bla bla... some normal mecha anime. When I watched the anime, I was expecting this kind action and thought the whole series was based on these robots fighting against \"angels\". I rated this anime an 8 because it completely twisted my expectations. Not only was there the fighting I expected but they added a lot of references to Christianity and the theme of Depression. I praise Anno for being able to express depression with this animation. I really liked how the characters are depicted as happy in the beginning but at the end we learn about all the emotions they all had hidden inside. Isn't strange how they mention Shinji rarely smiles? HINT HINT. Anyways, there is definitely symbolism in the EVA themselves. I believe that the EVAs represent something more than just machines to fight angels. They are outlets for many of the characters. When the characters get in the EVAs, they assume a higher position and far superior to their fellow humans. The synchronization rates also infers that the characters are connected to their EVAs emotionally, mentally, and physically. The EVAs represent their pilot. The fact that EVAs are also monsters show that each character piloting have their inner \"monsters\" also. \nArt: Earlier I mentioned that the art wasn't really my style. I do have to admit that Evangelion does have some pretty lit scenes. The fight scenes are wonderfully animated. For an anime created in 1995 and also with budget problems, they did create a masterpiece of their time. I liked how, since the anime was created in 1995, that the creators tried to incorporate a lot of advancement in technology. They really tried to think the animation out and make it look futuristic. I rated a 6 for these reasons.\nSound: One of the many things I enjoyed very much in Evangelion was the music. I've listened to the opening many times after the anime and will continue to listen to it. The ending was also well done and creatively thought about. In many episodes, the variation of the original ending played. You could never get sick listening since it was always changing. Background music was played at the right times to set the scene. There were also a lot of \"interesting\" scenes where the music played were almost like \"sick\" humor. The music definitely deserved an 8. I would love to listen to the music again and again.\nCharacters: OK! The characters are the ones that make the story possible. In the introduction I kind of explained my thoughts on EVA and what they really represent. The characters of Shinji, Rei, Asuka, and Misato each have varying personalities. THAT is the essential element of why this anime is so great. Their differing personalities however all lead to somewhat of a common root. The main focus is on the pilots. The character are really well written as they slowly reveal their hidden emotions. I feel like Asuka was a FOIL for Shinji in the beginning since she was so vibrant compared to Shinji but as the story ends, I realized that she and Shinji were very much alike. A lot of the characters with varying personalities, at the end, seemed to be alike in many ways. The whole complex relationship Shinji and his Dad was pretty important in most of the anime for his dad is the reason why Shinji pilots. I was a Shinji hater in the beginning but I realized as the story progressed Shinji has the right to act the way he does and began to pity his character. Shinji had a major character development at the end which is important to the theme of the anime. I believed that a lot more characters should've had more developments or developments that were beneficial instead of detrimental. The characters' motivations were all well set up and there was definitely a good guy vs. bad guy theme with a big twist. The characters deserve an 8 since they kept the show running.\nEnjoyment: I didn't expect to enjoy Neon Genesis Evangelion as much as I do after finishing it. Definitely close to a masterpiece with a lot of philosophy and thinking involved. The fight scenes are to be remembered and the emotions felt when watching the characters' internal conflicts. This anime has definitely taught me something.\nOverall: This anime was very well planned out so an 8 it is. The story was creative and interesting. I was pretty hooked onto the plot. The art, for its time, was ok and became less of a concern after deep stuff went down. The sound is an important part of the anime. I liked both the ending and opening. The soundtracks were played at the right times. CHARACTERS ARE SUPER IMPORTANT. The story is about these characters as they develop. The anime is a representation of reality with these characters struggle with themselves. Except for the futuristic elements, this anime is similar to a typical teenager struggling with their emotions. I did enjoy the anime well enough to sum up the rating to be an 8.\nThanks for reading my review! Hoped it was helpful.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Since its debut in 1995 few series in anime have garnered such acclaim and condemnation as Hideaki Anno's Neon Genesis Evangelion. The twenty-six episode anime incorporated deeply-personal psychological themes with the mecha genre, exploring the hearts and minds of its main characters as they fight to defend the world from a mysterious race of beings called the “Angels.”\nShinji Ikari has just arrived in Tokyo-3, a fortress city home to the headquarters of the international organization NERV, at the call of the father who abandoned him years prior. Any pretense of catching up and smoothing things over are swiftly dropped when Shinji learns he has been\n          \n        invited to the city for the sole purpose of serving as a pilot for one of NERV's Evangelion units.\nAs the series goes on, layers of political and psychological drama are stacked upon main storylines (battles to protect Tokyo-3 from Angels and Shinji's internal struggle over piloting the Eva). Humor seen early on gives way to mounting tension and distress as Shinji and the other Evangelion pilots encounter Angel after Angel.\nEvangelion tends to cruise along at a middle-of-the-road pace. Setup in the first few episodes is awesome: with the characters and settings all established in memorable fashion. The show settles in for a comparably easygoing mid-section, before going out on an absolute tear of brilliant writing and direction in its latter half.\nThe final two episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion are surely some of the most hotly debated in anime. It is here where Hideaki Anno's psychological themes override many other aspects of Evangelion and a decidedly-abstract approach is taken. Personally, I've always had a soft spot for the characters' introspection and how it was handled. Many interesting questions and points on the subjects of self-image and existentialism come up. It's certainly an unconventional finale, as much as it is encouraging and inspiring.\nLegendary characters, including the ghostly Rei, intense Asuka and indecisive Shinji, are surrounded by an equally great supporting cast. Misato, Gendo, Pen-Pen—there are too many classic characters to name, and every one of them is dynamic, well-written and superbly voiced. The depth of characters is impressive, giving Evangelion's action an emotional edge.\nThe tone-flat art style certainly dates the series, but Evangelion's character and setting design are unforgettable. Great storyboards further push Evangelion's visual front above average, while changes in lighting and medium fit changes in perspective and mood.\nMusic by Shirō Sagisu (Bleach, His and Her Circumstances) is top class. It's emotional, well-suited and perfectly produced. Simple and emotive piano and string melodies drill a majority of Evangelion's soundtrack into permanent memory. If any sound-related complaint is worth noting it would have to be the terribly-jarring transitions that occur at the end of several episodes, from hard-hitting scenes and screams straight into various renditions of closing theme “Fly Me To The Moon.”\nIf you've been avoiding Evangelion all of these years it's time to stop. The countless, classic scenes; the unforgettable characters and the great depths to which they are explored; Evangelion has rightly earned its place in history and has since carried on with a plethora of spin-off manga series and animated films.\nWritten originally for http://34fp8jlk987669.blogspot.com\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    Alright, so this is a major anime that has been called \"the star wars of Japan\". I watched it as, a mostly anti-Asian person watching anime for the first time, I was told it was an inevitability for any anime watcher, no matter how casual. In that regard I viewed it under that light, and so paid close attention on my watch. If my review takes liberties not usually associated it with anime, you'll have to forgive me, seeing as I'm mostly a literature guy and most of my analyses will be generally based on that front.\nThe story is as follows: A young boy is\n          \n        recruited by his distant unloving father into piloting robots to fight aliens called \"angels\" ironically enough that are trying to destroy Japan. He teams up with a blue haired quiet girl named Rei, who is stoic and spartan, and later on a German girl named Asuka, who is manic and extraverted. The boy, Shinji, undergoes a dual bildungsroman as he both learns to fit in at school with the others as well as deal with his father issues while fighting aliens. The aliens turn out to be a complex species who have attacked in the past, and from which the first robots were built. There is a lot of \"deep lore\" as my friend put it, but it doesn't really seem to matter beyond aesthetic. In the end, the girl Rei is revealed to be a clone undergoing existential drama at the fact that she's not really a person; Asuka is dealing with the stress of her mother's suicide and thus her psychological repricutions; And Shinji is dealing with his personal sense of isolation with regards to being an unwanted soul thrust into a key role in the preservation of humanity. In the end, Rei is given no ending, Asuka is left comatose in the hopsital from stress, and Shinji completes his bildungsroman as he realizes he needs other people to become a person in a melodramatic epiphany that overcomes solipsistic thinking.\nTo ellaborate more on Shinji, he is the protagonist obviously, and also the center of the show's ideas. He begins as a shy and vaguely immature boy thrust into a world of not only other adults but also other schoolchildren. He makes friends with his classmates as well as his fellow pilots, learns to conduct himself in the world of the government, particularly the Nerv agency he works for, and to become a fighter, more or less. This is rather a standard bildungsroman. He is generally rather individualistic, as the show goes to painful lengths to demonstrate for even the casually obtuse Japanese viewer, but in his final epiphany overcomes this. He also has an oedipus complex with his father which spreads coincidentally (at  least on a manifest level) to his mother, or at least her clones. His final development is forced by the appearance of a Kaworu, a fellow pilot who turns out to be an alien that is kind enough to allow himself to be killed. \nA tangent on this: the drama of the show is incomplete as the story turns from a drama of humanity threatened by invasion into a introspective narrative of an individual threatened by solipsism. The mythology in the show, as standard and uninteresting as it was, created a drama that was never finished, as the show turned toward its other plot later on and dodged by means of convenient narrative events and unapologetic ignoring of dramas set up earlier. This incomplete drama is unsatisfying, if I have to be completely honest with you.\nBack to my analysis. I've read the creator's interpretation of the characters, Rei allegorically symbolizing Shinji's unconscious -- that leads me to think of Asuka being his consciousness. The embracing of Rei as his mother and the defeat of Asuka in the end appears to be a self-overcoming, as he embraces himself and defeats his insecurity (which is blatantly admitted in the final soliloquy). If this is Japan's national pop story, then Shinji is the protagonist whose, like Luke Skywalker's, journey is mostly forgettable due to its melodramatic simplicity. \nRei is the most popular girl in Japan which tells me a lot about Japan. She's shy, stoic, and mostly unemotional. She's also a clone, I guess, which makes her character's death at any point in the show meaningless. Fine, cool I guess. She is probably the more aesthetically interesting of the two, living alone in a crappy, uncared-for apartment and loved by a man who was her husband, but is now a friendly stranger. She does not react to seemingly anything, even when intruded upon while naked by a stranger and in fact accidentally groped. She is unsexual, unemotional, and unattached, truly a symbol of the unconscious. \nOn the other hand we have the foil, Asuka. She is the typical hotheaded stubborn girl, and really the picture opposite of Rei. She is overemotional, overexpressive, and overconfident. Sexually she is completely open, calling everyone she doesn't like perverts and literally throwing herself at people she wants, kissing Shinji for amusement and flashing her tits at some older guy. Still we are obviously meant to take her as a symbol of what Dostoevsky called hyperconsciousness, overthinking and rationalizing her way through everything. This is stemmed from a boring \"childhood trauma\", seeing the suicide of her mother. Obsessed with victory and an ironic attachment to an overstoic philosophy Asuka is a ticking time bomb, and of course she goes into a comatose state at the end of the show, utterly defeated in the morality play. Nevertheless I think she's the most likeable character, very cute and funny. Her energy and shallow but enjoyable aesthetic lends itself to the thin art of anime.\nAnother duality are the two older ladies of the show -- Misato and Ritsuko (I can't remember these Japanese names, had to look them up). Misato is a rather appealing image of a woman -- professional when she needs to be, slovenly when she doens't. She's (also) got father issues and is in a world of denial, doing things at utility and living at the bare psychological minimum. Ritsuko is the more stoic, the Rei to Misato's Asuka, with her own mother issues and a less developed psychological utilitarianism. She was fucking Shinji's father I guess or something. I don't really know. These characters aren't really interesting and their psychological journeys both amount to nothing more than melodrama. Unlike Shinji their plots aren't developed, nor are they as clean allegories into Shinji's consciousness. The title card to the last episode more or less says \"we don't have the time to deal with everything so we'll show you how Shinji got his shit in line\". We see images of them both being dead, and frankly I think they're less iinteresting to look at on their own. Therefore I'm just gonna leave it at \"they're both '''modern''' women who are dealing with elements of governmental and personal utilitarianism in their lives and have oedipal issues and then they died or something\". \nThe Freudian element while a bit juvenile is probably the most interesting thing in the show. Each of the major characters have on some level parental issues, as you might have read above (or if you've seen the show would obviously see). As a bildungsroman the show obviously takes into account parental relationships. There are no normal parent-child relationships in this series I can remember, (even a random classmate says \"i don't have a mother\") and so the character relationships are all either between peers or between adults and children unrelated. \nThe fixation on parental relationships is incidentally driven home by the aliens invading, as they're called \"angels\" -- the conflict between the angels, typically associated with protecting and loving beings (like parents) and the embittered children is a strange but actually compelling image. The angels are mysterious and unknown, attacking for no reason, like a child fighting against his parents in whom he can see no rationality. Although the oedipal complexes are never resolved, the underwhelming and uncelebrated defeat of the angels is enough of a resolution to the oedipal complex -- i guess.\nWith its love of Freud, the show also obsesses with sex. In the first five minutes alone we see Shinji, who is being picked up in a car by Misato, have a picture of the latter which is rather sexual looking (she is bent over, you can see a bit of her tits), and when in the car with her she calls him cute. This sexual tension later spreads, and while Shinji seems uninterested in sex his classmates are. He accidentally falls on a naked Rei, is in bed with and later kisses a hypersexual Asuka, and oftentimes is greeted with visions, both imaginary and real, of naked versions of his friends. It is an interesting choice to make Shinji a most asexual person in a hypersexual world. Nevertheless the show does a good job with sexual tension -- in some of the episodes it is truly palpable the restraint with which it is handled. The episode especially where Asuka and Shinji are forced to learn a synchronized dance pattern (which, yes, found a place in a show about oedipal complex and robots fighting aliens) is absolutely dripping with tension. I think, if the show is trying to capture the narrative of a teenage experience, this is a very tasteful addition. But I'll stop talking excitedly about sex in anime because it really doesn't make me look good.\nThe show invokes a lot of Biblical imagery as well. There are numerous crosses, beings called Angels, and an alien in the mythology called Adam. It is supposed the conflict is some kind of revision to the Biblical mythology. This is the title translated from Japanese, as wikipedia would have it - \"The Gospel of the New Century\". If we are to take this as a new Gospel, perhaps they have failed, for the ethical teachings seem to amount to \"you can't do it alone\" which I could've gotten from the scrubs theme song and the metaphysical theology seems to amount to \"reality is perception but not truth or something lmao\", mostly poorly regurgitated philosophy that reeks of too much Camus and Sartre. \nAdding to this, the philosophy in general of the show seems to be very much more derived from weed and self help books than from the actual philosophic tradition. This may however be a cultural difference, if the show draws on Asian philosophy. In that case I don't want to tread too much on that due to my lack of philosophic experience with the Asian tradition, but I wasn't personally impressed by the philosophic elements of the show.\nAesthetically the show is rather unremarkable. The animation is nice and all but appears fairly similar to other animation typical of anime. Still there were some nice shots and there was a lot of cute animation. There was a penguin that was waddling around in the background for a lot of it which was interesting enough I guess. I was going to comment on how much I liked the animation of Asuka and Rei but I shaved my neck and the urge all dropped, so I don't know what to tell you.\nIn summary I guess the show is typically appealing. It has some vaguely entertaining action, although I don't really like action so can't really comment on it, some cute characters, interesting mythology (although undeveloped), and a descent into psychological introspection, not so deep as it is pseudoepiphanic which is shallowly exciting without offering much for critical thought, and is generic enough to appeal to many people while distinctive enough to not bore. Taken seriously, it is a repetitive melodrama that invokes psychological and literary ideas without anything to contribute to them other than pastiche of freudian and biblical images, vaguely mishadled, but it also has cute anime girls, so I can't hate on it too much. \n        "},

Don't expect anything to work out the way you had in mind because it most likely will just confuse you, and maybe anger you. You will most likely get to experience the \"Evangelion-Mindfuck\" and around then you will know if you love it or hate it.\nIf i ever had to get into a argument discussing why anime should be respected as a art from, I would have to pick out NGE as one of my top 3\n          \n        examples. Its something that will keep you up late at night or have your attention anytime it is mentioned. With that being said it is in need of a Blu-Ray Re-Release as you can tell how much attention to detail was given to all the action sequences. There are some \"questionable\" sections where the animation tanks into some downright still-frame set pieces (and yes they are set pieces because you sure as hell don't forget them).\nComing from a much longer history of film, I don't see NGE all that hard to understand which almost puts me into a minority of the fan base. I only say this because i have watched films that are purely designed to be confusing and make you look for answers where there are non, or maybe. The characters may seem like they are the traditional tropes we seen in anime but back in 1995, Evangelion set the bar and is still being copied till this day. Were the characters as developed as the archetypes today that took ques from NGE? Of course not, its not the goal of a pioneer to become the greatest of all time in character development, but without this, many great characters we have today would most likely cease to exist for the lack of popularity alone. \nThe weakest point of the entire show is its sound and it probably due to a long list of limitations that happen to all older anime for the time. Voice acting is not the greatest at first ether but soon seems to fit better and better as time progresses. The art keeps a timeless charm that sits well into the 90's culture it came from but 20 years later in 2015, this show still feels relevant. The enjoyment of the show isn't about the fun and wacky things that a team gets into like a typical shonen show today but rather how much deeper the rabbit hole you get into. Trying to piece together the events to a vague foreshadowing of whats to come, leaving you confused enough to wonder what the fuck your watching, but intrigued enough to make you think about it long enough until you ether hate everything or love how much it speaks to you long after the credits roll. This is something that is beyond anime, its a zeitgeist of the generation X that asked why is there any meaning to anything anyways... And the truth is that there isn't. Sometimes things just need to be asked and not answered because the goal of the question was never to be answered but be discussed. \nThat is real art.\nNGE is not as complicated as Under The Skin or Enemy (both films have more brain fuckery than this and the movie combined so relax) but it does speak on or at least touch on elements of depression, loneliness, pride, sex, shame, individualism, god, hatred and love. It isn't made to give you answers but rather showcase these terms in a somewhat realist point of view. What would you say as a abandoned child and being forced to become a warrior? What would you do if you have to kill something you don't want to? How numb do you become when enduring the worst of your fears? This is what NGE is about, the robots are only a plus to this classic deconstruction of the mech genre in anime. Still to this day it feels like its ahead of its time but one thing for sure is that anime would not be where it is today if it wasn't for Evangelion.\n        "},

This anime focuses more on the pilots of the Eva's and how there past and emotions affects them. \nThe first half of the anime focuses on fighting the angels that are invading earth. Then the second half focuses on the psychological problems of each of the characters. Your going to be asked what is the point of living and what is your purpose in life. The second half of this anime is kinda depressing. \nThis anime does have a\n          \n        lot of action, and the animation for the action is very good for the 90's, but the studio ran out of money during the second half and it is very obvious because the animation drop's pretty significantly. \nThe characters are overall good. I have a problem with Rei though. She doesn't really change through out the anime at all. She doesn't really have a personality. but there is a answer for that though. Asuka can come off as pretty annoying in the beginning, but she brings out the other characters personality, which was needed. I don't want to tell you anything about the main character though. \nOverall I would totally recommend this for anybody who is ready for a roller coaster of emotions. Also watch the end of evangelion movie, it will answer your questions at the end of the series.   \n        "},

The beginning and middle of the show is great, but later episodes make a sudden--and at times extreme--shift. Budget issues forced the creators to take a highly experimental approach, which some viewers may find off-putting and others may find intriguing.\nThe anime is an interesting deconstruction of the mecha genre; it stops to consider what it might be like for child soldiers to enter the battlefield, with humanity's survival riding on their shoulders. Many of the characters are implied to have PTSD and are severely damaged. The three main characters, Shinji, Asuka, and Rei, all face immense psychological obstacles.\nEarly episodes are\n          \n        somewhat dark and psychological, but with the introduction of Asuka, the series lightens slightly and becomes a little more action-oriented. Beginning with episode 16, the show becomes more and more psychological and experimental. Due to restrictions, many plotlines, concepts, and character points are left unresolved, and at times pacing seems off. The last two episodes are extremely unconventional and many viewers are likely to find them disagreeable; End of Evangelion is meant to provide an alternate ending.\nOne note to women viewers: there are some very 'fanservice-y' or objectifying scenes throughout the anime, which may be uncomfortable. This generally lessens in the later portion of the anime.\n        "},

In fact I may have even loved it if I didn't know about \"Rei Ayanami\".  When I was in the Navy, I had a friend that loved this series.  He had all the dvds and a lot of action figures for this as well.  So I decided that I would ask him about this series.  As a hardcore fan would, he told me that it was an awesome series and lent me the dvds so that I could watch them.  However while watching\n          \n        it I had an odd feeling about this Rei girl, and when I asked said person about it, he confirmed that i was right.

There are a lot of themes of trauma and detachment that are explored brilliantly. From the start, it's very much in the psychological genre.  Without giving anything away, I'll say that there is also so much symbolism that can be analyzed. NGE is set in a futuristic and post-apocalyptic world, so in that sense it follows the standard, but otherwise the plot takes on a very, very unique feel. For the first few episodes, the viewer has to be really patient I'd say, because every episode seems to\n          \n        be a separate short story but starting from the 12th or so episode, it really becomes insanely interesting. Like my friend said to me it took her 3 months to watch the first 5 episodes but maybe 2 days for the last 9. I think that is really representative of the momentum of the series, where in the later chapters, a deeper layer is revealed and becomes the driving force of suspense.  \nAlso a lot of controversy surrounds the ending, but I really think that Gainax just ran out of animation money, so if you skip episodes 25 and 26 (these are the ones that people complain are not even completely animated) and go straight to End of Evangelion (which is in canon with NGE, and is episodes 25 and 26 taking place over 2 hours), then you should be much more satisfied. \nArt: 8 \nThe art is old, so I would say that I went into it not expecting much. But some aspects were pleasantly surprising.  For example, the Angels were so varied and created with unique traits so that it never felt like I'd seen the same design in another anime etc. The  EVA movies 1+2, I've heard are literally exact reanimations of the anime series with a higher budget, so maybe if animation is a big deal, watch those? \nSound: 6 \nNGE has actually really laughable sound at some points, like these extremely odd uses of classical music, but otherwise it's a good soundtrack. The same battle music, this pounding timpani thing, is actually played in each episode over and over again, when they encounter an Angel, but it comes to  be a kind of good repetition because it helps you feel the fear of that encounter. Even though there were maybe at least 10 instances of the same music, I never got tired of it.  I wouldn't worry too much about the sound in general because it's only one or two scenes where it's really bad, otherwise they do a good job. With this show also, I also wondered whether the disjointed music might have been on purpose.\nCharacter: 10\nI love these characters. I love Shinji, I think he's deep and realistic and he's very identifiable. The rest of the cast are all extremely well wrought out characters as well. Each one has such a distinct personality that it's impossible not to care about them. People criticize the animation maybe, but I don't think people can really criticize the characters of NGE because they are just so human and complex. Personally, I also love that this series has a lot of strong women. \nEnjoyment: 10 \nI think that I was watching NGE, thinking of it as a classic. I think it ended up being actually really enjoyable to me, personally and I ended up being way more involved than I thought I would, mostly because I fell in love with these characters. I think that if you're open minded and see what the show does well, then I think it can definitely be a really great experience! \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    To get one thing straight this is a damn good anime and tends to be referenced a lot, and on a personal note this was the first anime I can really remembered even though I had only seen the trailers of it on old vhs tapes of godzilla movies and later on I stumble a crossed it again and started watching it. I had little knowledge of anime streaming sights so I wound up watching what ever was available on youtube which wasn't much and I saw it out of sequence until I came back to it with knowledge of streaming and I finally watched\n          \n        the whole series, and this is what I thought.\nImpression\nlike I said before the show was pretty damn good, it had a beginning a middle but the end is what may make you hate this anime, however now after some time has passed I have actually come to like the ending, due in large part that the movies that they made to retell this ending where kinda bullshit and actually worse than the original, and also reading the manga that had a similar conclusion but not as mind fuckish.\nCharacters\nThe Characters in evangelion, um, well the the thing about eva is that if you have certain taste you like certain characters and completely hate the others, Shinji who is the main character of the series however being a very well written character tends to be a less popular one as some of his emotional issues and depression get in the way and then asuka a red head from germany who actually has the same issues as shinji but behaves completely different which makes her both a very beloved character and a very hated character and then there's Rei, well Rei is just rei and thats kind of ok, she's seems to be the only character that doesn't let her problems get in the way and she's really the character that I kinda wanted to see more of, and if you would have to be some kind of bully to really hate her character. There are other characters in the series like Misato and kaji and gendo and many more but the main focus is more focused on the younger characters.\nSub vs. Dub\nI initially tried watching this in english but there was english mixed japanese episodes so I had to rough it through a little bit until I eventually streamed it in english and finished the whole series that way. At first I really could not tell which was better. the dub was simply a dub and that was it until I watched it in japanese and, I was actually disappointed.\nnow before anyone gets disappointed I have a personal preference when it comes to sub and dub and mine contradicts what most people prefer. I like it when the english and japanese voices are different, I even like it when the personalities are different, because I like to watch something different, it becomes a fresher experience and the evangelion sub although being original felt like the same thing in english though the voice actors in the english dub added a little more to the table by actually writing the script it's self and even adding in different accents and even languages that made characters like asuka unique, and rei the the silent character seemed a little human in the english dub while in japanese she was more or less a ghost and the japanese just wasn't different enough to notice it.\non another note I've seen the spanish dub as well (latino) which makes the japanese even seem worse as the voices were in there own right \"unique\" and it had it's own take on it, granted I could complain about how when a subtitle in the show would come there would be like this hispanic soccer announcer voice that would read it out loud which I found annoying but this was intended for a different audience, but some of the characters sounded different (in a good way) like shinji's tone of voice sounded really good but the acting wasn't as good as in the japanese and english and Rei sounded completely badass in this version, asuska was average and kaji actually sounded right on with his character and wasn't such a sarcastic smart ass like in the english dub.\nbut to top it off it depends on your taste, if you are a complete worshiper of everything japanese which you have likely already stopped reading by this point you will like the sub, if you prefer to see it in your own languages (spanish or english) then those dubs will suffice as for the other 11 languages this is dubbed in I don't know.\nFinal verdict\nI would give this anime a score of about 8.5\nthis anime, despite it's flaws tends to be the sort you can watch repeatedly but I normally would not suggest it without warning about the potential flaws in the show (particularly at the ending)\n        "},

Although I once read something funny and quite fitting; NGE is not an anime, its a philosophy paper in disguise.\nI remember the first time I watched it, it simply blew me away, even after re-watching it 5 times, I still love this show no matter what people say about the end, to me it's great. I'm not going to pretend that this anime has no flaws (but nothing is perfect).\nThe story, the characters, the art, sound, action, mystery, drama, psychological mind fucks - everything is well done. I'm\n          \n        not the person to over hype things, but there aren't many animes that made me feel like this. It influenced so many other writers and animators and you can see that influence in countless other shows, which tried to do what Evangelion was able to accomplish. Every episode sucked me more and more into the story (it was pure joy to watch it), you can't help but wonder what's really going on?, who is behind this mess? and so on. Yes, the end is a little confusing and seems rather weird (some questions don't get answered), but once you understand it all (I recommend to watch the movies for that, although the movie is a little pretentious) you'll understand the plot better. What's really special about NGE is that it's high class in all three important points that make an anime a hit or miss - its animation (for 90s standard), story, and character development - in Evangelion it all works. \nWhat could I write that hasn't been written yet in other reviews? (I don't want to describe the long complicated plot like many others already did lol) It's an amazing anime that deserves all the praise, and although I understand some peoples frustrations with it, you shouldn't miss this classic show because of that, watch it then decide yourself whether it's a masterpiece or not."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n   Whether or not you will enjoy this show, it depends on the person. Personally, I loved it. The story was intriguing, but by far the best part about Evangelion is the characters. Some people I know look like they want to kill themselves every time I mention Evangelion, while others can't stop talking about it. Overall, I think the characters were brilliant and, of course, every single one of them is deeply disturbed. Is it a show for pretentious assholes? Yes. In my opinion, however, the way it disturbs you is different from animes like Elfen\n          \n        Lied, where it mainly focuses on blood pinatas and shock value, while in Evangelion you will see a widower who attempts to recreate his wife by cloning her remains who later is crushed on by a boy who is genetically her son. Said widower attempts to reunite with his wife by turning the whole world into orange tang so that all human minds will become one. Some doctor lady becomes said widower's new lover, and upon seeing that he cloned his wife, gets jelly and kills toddler clone, later killing herself, only to be replaced by her daughter as the same man's sexual partner. You can see this show as random, indistinguishable, pretentious shit (with really bad animation) or as a masterpiece that delves into the human mind, maybe even teaching the watcher a little bit about themselves. And if you think Evangelion was fucked up, just wait till you see End of Evangelion. Great music, by the way.\n        "},

Overall, I was underwhelmed with Neon Genesis Evangelion. I'm not sure if it's because it's such an old anime or if it wasn't that great to begin with.\nThe story started out vague, got more clear, then just got confusing. Some things just aren't explained, similar to the Dark Souls series. The difference being Dark Souls is a game that's not mainly story-driven, while a show should be story-driven. Nice try, guy. Overall, the story is typical with some interesting twists, but nothing amazing.\nI'm actually impressed that the art was so\n          \n        acceptable for such an old anime. At no point during my watching did I ever think, \"Wow, this anime looks super old.\" Good on them for that. Same thing goes for the sound. Nothing was really bad or good, except for the opening and ending songs. Those were pretty catchy.\nThe highlight of NGE was definitely the characters. For the most part, each character has a lot of depth and develops in interesting ways. Keeping in mind that the director of this anime was going through depression during its creation makes the character development make a lot more sense. There are no god-like super perfect protagonists, just normal people, complete with flaws (even fatal ones).\nUnfortunately, the anime takes a turn for the WTF near the end, which throws the plot of the story out the window and cheapens the character development considerably. I found myself thinking, \"Can I get 26 episodes of my life back?\" I can see how this anime may appeal to certain people, however. Basically, if you came just for mech combat, you'll be bored.\nBelievable, introspective, and intricate characters weighed down by the meandering story drags my final score for this anime down to a 7.\n"},

However, it seems there is more than meets the eye, as underlying plots begin to unravel themselves.\n   The art of Neon Genesis Evangelion is, at some times, beautiful, but at others, it's a bit lackluster. This is especially noticeable later in the series, as the funds for animation were cut due\n          \n        to a combination of unfortunate events. Overall throughout the series, the animation is good where it needs to be but the anime certainly takes some shortcuts over the course of 26 episodes, as all shows do.\n   The characters of Neon Genesis Evangelion are where the show really shines. Each one of them has desires and motivations that belong to them and them alone, and as the series progresses the viewer begins to understand exactly why these exist. The three main characters and Evangelion pilots, Shinji, Rei, and Asuka especially seem to suffer from some major problems in their pasts. Shinji struggles with his father's rejection, and his need of praise from others, while Asuka struggles more with keeping up her false persona of, \"the nice girl,\" being too insecure to show the person she is deep down. Rei, unfortunately, can't really be explained without heavy plot spoilers.\n   My personal enjoyment of the show stemmed from my love of complex and well written characters, and it certainly helped that I enjoy both giant robots, and aliens. Shinji especially, is able to connect with not only myself but many other viewers of the show.\n   Overall, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a show believed by many to be a must-watch. Even if you don't particularly enjoy it, it's such an influential show (inspiring many current character archetypes, visuals, etc) that it really is an important show for any anime fan to have seen.\n        "},

I watched long after the hype, and I didn't regret it. I thoroughly enjoyed most of it. Nothing's ever just a robot fight, there's always some extra crazy scenario going on and it gets super intense, which kept me rabidly going back for more. Most of the characters are pretty cookie-cutter but STILL enjoyable, which is an accomplishment in and of itself. Unfortunately all of the revelations and story elements collided together like shit by the end, and even in the movies.\nThere's a certain point\n          \n        where this toon drops what makes it enjoyable and dives head-first into the pool of sheer, unabashed pretentiousness that had no foreshadowing throughout the first 5/6 of the series. Things become horribly rushed at the end due to what I've heard was a budget issue, but even in the ending films when they had the chance to fix it, they still dropped the ball. \nIn other words, it's not as smart as it pretends to be toward the end, and boy will it BEG you to think it's smart.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    It has actually been some time since I finished this anime, maybe 4 or 5 weeks.  Therefore, this isn't totally reflective of the anime as much as what the anime represents.  There have been many proponents of this anime, but also a lot of critics.  However, I found this anime as something of a beacon.  It acted to light the way for tons of other anime.  It spread into a lot of the genres we see today.  Mecca is one.  The \"coming of age by gaining an extremely awesome power\" story is coming up, as well as the\n          \n        \"rebellion against the parent\" story.\nFrom this alone you can make a list of anime a mile long: Rahxephon, Guilty Crown, Code Geass, Full Metal Alchemist, Shakugan no Shana.  These are just a few of the many anime that have followed in the footsteps of this masterpiece.\nAs a whole, we measure great anime by their lasting impact.  Evangelion definitely had one of the biggest impacts in the industry by far.  However, that is the way we measure it as the public in general.  It really is hard to say specifically what you loved about an anime that changed you.  Therefore, we come up with words like \"revolutionary\" or \"game-changing\".  These are general relative terms that really aren't much different from how the entire world views the anime from afar.  It's like giving a person who hasn't seen the anime a perception of it without them actually participating in the experience, which is whole point.\nTherefore, hopefully, I will be able to shed some more light on my personal reasons for loving this anime.\nFirst off, the story was phenomenal.  It was a clearly original idea that combined creation myth/christian symbolism with bloody humanity and war.  Escapism meets conformity.  Tradition meets the winds of change.  It creates a stew of mixed intentions until the mixture begins to poor out in anticipation.  Romance is thrown in there with the same mood as the rest of the story.  Really, if there is a two word description of this anime it's \"uncomfortably stimulating\".  Romance is thrown in and one might think of it as awkward.  In fact, that is the whole point.  It throws more into the mind of an utterly messed up main character.  It's rare to find a story with depth in both theme and character development.  Although, if I may be allowed to interject my sad opinion, after watching Evangelion: Death and Rebirth, I feel kind of sad that nothing ended up happening between Ikari and Asuka.  Oh well.  It's all about the anticlimactic ending.  Like \"it's over?  Yeah, I guess so.\"\nSecond off, one thing that was mentioned already.  The characters are developed until the viewers brains start to pour out of their ears.  It just gets sooooo intense in terms of the realness of the characters.  It's not as if you could see yourself being them, or that they could ever actually be real people, but the fact that despite that you still pity them deeply is just testament to the great care that the writers took in writing and creating this series.\nNow, one thing I must say before ending off.  The last two episodes were not a mistake.  If anything, I felt they helped.  It ended up being just one huge scientific experiment of the Ikari's mind.  It was weird, I'll grant you that.  However, it did not take away from the anime's quality.  I don't want to hear any garbage about the fact that they spent to much money and they ran out of budget so they just made a slideshow.  The fact of the matter is, the last two episodes were extremely high quality despite the budget restrictions.  If you weren't patient enough to notice that, good luck liking any of the other episodes, or even understanding the great depth of the story.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion deserves all of the praise and the criticism that it gets, because that's what anime is there for.  It's a dartboard for ideas and emotions.  Evangelion just raised the stakes a little.  The only difference between those who loved it and those who hated it is that some were prepared and the others weren't, which is completely fine.  However, I think it is crucial that every avid anime viewer at least try Evangelion.  It gives a unique insight into what an anime can become once it becomes almost a legend.  Remember, what you can't sense has much more power over you than what you can control.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Shin Sekei Evangelion is an interesting show, its age definitely shows by today's standards, and in more ways than one. But with a gripping story and a great first episode, how does it stand today?\nEvangelion is a show which takes mecha, philosophy and religious symbolism and mushes it all together! NGE is a series which had done which other shows had not at the time; a mecha show going beyond the awkward, bulkiness that plagues other mecha shows, beyond the pew pew of lasers and mecha superiority over humans. Supported by a cast of 3 main characters, one of which has been known to turn\n          \n        off would-be fans with their whining (though I was hardly phased). It is both cursed and gifted for being from Anno; the story starts of strong, injecting intrigue and curiosity at all the correct parts. But as the story unfolds, so does Anno's mind; he falls into depression and it takes its toll upon the show. \nAs the show nears its climax, it suffers both from Anno's depression and funding issues from Gainax; the last 6 or so episodes are fraught with cuts to video sequences of cinemas, hate mail, and the hustle n' bustle of Japan. The last two episodes go as far to shatter and deny all lore and build up to that point, considered by many a fan to be a cop-out to end a show upon. So much so that quite a number of fans would say to skip the last two episodes and go straight to the End of Evangelion film. These last 6 episodes were a big issue for me; they tarnished the otherwise high quality show that is NGE; so much so I purposefully skipped such video sequences in annoyance. \nNow ultimately; would I recommend NGE to a friend? No... I would recommend Rebuild instead! This original TV series is plagued with a few too many flaws in the latter half which leaves the series feeling subpar.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    ----Intro Yo.\nMy name is Arais Demlant. I'll begin by writing about my personal varied and most certainly unique opinion on the most controversial show ever created, Neon Genesis Evangelion. (Side note, if you want to skip the rantings [a.k.a. Introduction] of a deranged psychopath and jump into the criticisms, go just past Asuka to the character grievances section.)\nFor any storyline discussion and loopholes, I am sure that the reviewers above me have adequately covered its flaws and high points. I will simply delve into the matters that interested me the most, regarding some of the story, and the characters. \nNow I certainly will not say\n          \n        that the entire story was trash, and the characters suck, and bash it into the ground without mercy like how I eat my food. But I will note that some of the characters have made me feel more angered than I have ever felt before, and so angry that I actually wanted to break things (As a side note, I did.) Now, there is a certain character that does this better than anyone else for me, and guess who it is? Not Asuka, it's the main protagonist Shinji.\n----Characters (A few of them)\nThe characters in this story are fairly unique, and all have their personalities and psychological disorders, and are hated or loved uniquely by each viewer based upon their personal opinion. That being said:\n-Shinji Ikari.\nThe idea behind the main character was to create a character with depth, and that felt more real to the viewer, and to change the way people look at main protagonists from viewing the typical headstrong 14 year old badass. However, never in my life have I ever harbored such an overwhelming hatred for a fictional character who literally could not think or act for himself in any way possible. Throughout all 26 episodes, and the \"movie\", he did not develop his character in almost any way. He did not grow in any way, He still was the same wimp he started as. All he did was whine and complain and cry over and over again, and never once took the reins and said, \"Motherfucker, lets do this.\"  You may criticize that it is not part of his chracter, but if there ever was any human that did not stand up for his/herself even once, or even THINK for themselves, just HOW are they going to survive? I will regard him as being the most annoying wimpy kid I have ever seen in any show that I will ever watch, and the worst excuse for a protagonist in any show I will ever come across. Watching him cry and whine his way through 26 episodes was pure torture. (And that one part... In the movie... With a bed...) \n-Rei?\nReminds me of a similar version of Yin from Darker than Black. Strange antisocial demented girl who fantasizes about Shinji's father and may or may not? develop some emotions for Shinji throughout the series. Still, I regard her as a huge mentally unstable character that may as well be replaced with a suicidal washtowel. \n-Misato.\nAttempts to halfheartedly lighten the mood of the series and provide parental? guidance for Shinji. Overall, she full-fills her role, albeit she does have HUGE flaws, which I will summarize in the general griefs below. \n-Asuka. \nOddly enough, and to many people's suprise I am sure, was one of the ONLY characters I think that truly developed in this series, and one of the only characters that I really wanted to know more about. Idiotic, I would presume would be what is going through most people's heads when reading (Which I assume most wont) this review. However, let me state that as other characters (i.e. Shinji) still stay the same whiny kid that they started as, Asuka reverts from being a total annoying bitch (It's true, the bitch part that is) to being a human being that actually displays most human emotions. Emotions that should have been exploited more but were suddenly halted my a spear or two. However with that being said, I will summarize my main grievances with the characters almost directly below.  \n-Other characters, yeah they're there but you know, watch the show to find out who they are eh?\n----Problems with the characters (AKA the grievances section of a rambling psycho)\n\nThe problem that bugged me most about this series, and the characters, at least to me, is that I look at things from a highly logical state. When I watch anime, I criticize not only the show as I watch it, but myself at the same time. That being said, watching this show raised so many questions such as the one that bugged me the most and that shortly follows: \"Why the hell does no one care about these kids?\" Truly, I can not word that any better or emphasize that any better.\nThese kids (14 year old kids are the only ones that can pilot giant robots apparently) have HUGE psychological problems and have serious mental breakdowns that no one considers or cares to fix. Shinji is a suicidal runway and mentally insane coward, Asuka is a way too prideful headfirst know it all, and Rei just seems like a washtowel that wants to commit suicide. If I was going to put a child into a giant mech that is going to save the universe, I would at least make sure that he is not going to cry for 20 minutes and whimper in a corner during a fight first. Remember when Asuka had that mental breakdown and they just \"Threw\" her back in her Eva? I just wished there was one person, just one in this entire series, just ONE that just said, \"You alright man?\" \nNot a single person cared about the metal state of these kids nor tried to resolve their problems. Because of this, and mostly because of this, I cannot bring myself to like this series. Misato was supposed to be the parental guardian of Shinji (And really all three of them) and was supposed to be responsible for his mental and physical state, but in reality she failed in the mental department. Shinji just became a trainwreck of mental instability. Asuka tried to reach out and have someone talk to her, to discuss her feelings, yet she was abandoned for the suicidal washtowel. They, as in the characters in the show, basically tossed her aside like trash and lit her house and belongings on fire and said good riddens. Rei, sorry I mean the washtowel, was just suicidal through and through and could not think about her well being for any reason whatsoever.  \nThe characters were so flawed and the story, especially with the movie, left so many openings and flaws and just confusion, that I actually do not know how to react to emotionally. It is like I am staring at my stove and I am getting a hard on and do not know why. In a strange way, that's how I feel about this show. It's unique. No doubt about that. And because it is so unique, you truly need to watch it and form your own opinion on if it is good or not. \nThat being said, the characters and their ridiculous flaws may be this series' selling point??? It spikes discussion and controversy, like my rant being posted here, and will certainly envelop people for hours discussing why they think their opinion is correct. \nStrangely enough, there are enough good qualities about the show that make it a worthwhile watch, but please, if you take on thing out of my \"review\", please look at it in a way similar to mine. Just think about what they are doing as you watch the show. \nP.S. The movie, the movie is a whole 'nother story. Be wary, Be very wary. \n        "},

This series focuses far more on the Childrens' emotional development and dissection of their identities.  Even when they're fighting, it's never just about victory.  Battles always have a deeper meaning- berserker, emotional strength and persistence, pride, and the psychological breaking point, for example.  I have even recommended Evangelion to my college psychology and sociology professors.\nNormally, I do not enjoy stories that survive on withheld information (ie anything by Dan Brown).

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    What else can I say? Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most thought provoking, influential, and gripping anime ever created. It is truly a conceptual masterpiece. It's references are endless (from the deep religious concepts such as the book of genesis and the kabbalah to the call to japan's history of giant mecha films) and it manages to weave every one of it's influences together seamlessly. It features one of the most realistic and complex character developments i've seen in any television series by way of its protagonist, Shinji Ikari, and its exploration of human interactions and emotions left me wanting to evaluate the\n          \n        way I treat/think of others. The battles are excellent, not just some silly punch-em-up you would expect from a giant mecha series. Yes, even the Eva units are at the mercy of the realistic nature of machine battle and have limits on their power sources. All of the characters are more or less unique and I was left wondering who was truly the good guy until the final episodes. Which unfortunately brings me to my only problem with this series: the ending. While I do understand the situation Gainax was going through at the time (I would have given this a 10 if End Of Evangelion would count towards it), I still must be unbiased in how I review what is quite possibly one of my favorite anime ever. I was on the edge of my seat through this whole series, often unable to focus at school due to constant contemplation of this series' plot and the agendas of different character and groups. It all felt like it was for nothing once I was hit with a hard to watch, drawn out, low-budget ending. I recommend anyone who watches this series to immediately watch the End Of Evangelion film after this series. Fortunately, despite the ending, this series still sticks out as one of the greatest anime of all-time for  me, and is easily a eternally rewatchable classic. Hideaki Anno, you are a creative genius.\n        "},

If you're reading this considering watching the series, please do so, and just watch it as a regular show. It's good, but it's up to you whether it's great. \nJust as a note, don't let anyone tell you Evangelion is pretentious bullshit. It has been proven by dedicated fans to be a\n          \n        thoughtfully written story (the Rebuilds are questionable in that regard, but they're still good). \nDon't bother reading the rest, because as I said, the hype kills the show. \nSPOILERS \n\nEvangelion is not a purely plot driven show, sure stuff happens, but what matters is what happens to the characters. How they react when experiencing both the otherworldly, and common human difficulties. Our characters have all undergone trauma, and have been formed by their pasts, but their will is very apparent. Even Rei, who's supposed to be a clone rebels against who she's been formed to be at that point. The aspect of choice and the will to go on despite everything is very important to this. \nArt is a form of expression, and the director Anno definitely put a lot of expression into this. He painted a picture  of a world so torn apart, yet humans find the will to go on in a structured society. Frankly, it's a breath of fresh air compared to the typical apocalyptic anarchy situation. \nEvery episode is just drenched with the feeling that something unknown is going on. \nWe cheer for Shinji when he overcomes an enemy, as well as overcoming himself, but what's an Angel? Why are they attacking? What is this giant robot? Why does it have a normal eye?\nWhat was the deal with Rei appearing before Shinji in the first episode in a mirage like manner?\nOn the surface, it's a pretty typical show (with some weird parts), ending with a pretty anticlimactic (but still satisfying) ending. However, just a small look at the lore, the theory, and the significance behind everything that happens when keeping that lore in mind if pretty damn mind-boggling. It's very impressive for a show with the budget it has to have such a wide reaching canon. \nWhen it comes to the animation and action, it's pretty typical, budget constricted mecha stuff, but it's still really well directed. However, bear with me here when I say that a larger budget might not have really helped it that much. As I said before, this is a character driven story that is tied in with a mech anime scenario. \nLet me say one thing about the characters. They start off being very unexciting tropes, but little by little you see more of them. What's behind their masks. Shinji has a problem understanding people, so it wouldn't surprise me that the audience is being guided mostly from Shinji's perspective and knowledge. These characters have believable weaknesses, vices, and pain. Few characters are seen as quite in depth as Shinji, but that doesn't mean we don't get a look at how they are just as conflicted and (yes) deep as him. We see them appear, succeed, happy, sad, fail, destroy, sink to new lows, lose their minds.\nI hate to ramble about what I probably could write a 20 page essay on if it was truly worth doing, but there's really so much to say about this show. The cinematography is still some of the best an anime series has ever produced. By the end (and I mean the movie), we have seen many sides of our characters, and even more of what the entire plot was leading up to. It's a show that is meant to be watched at least twice. I too had a feeling of \"that's it?\" after the last episode of the series, but the movie is so phenomenal. \nThere are two kinds of people who finish this series. There are those who believe the strange storytelling style and occurrences  that go unexplained for the most part to be examples of pretentious filler to appear more intelligently written a work than it's deserved. There are also those who look at that in wonder, and theorize and think about it, reflecting on the series as a whole, the characters and their own feelings.To truly enjoy the show requires a certain amount of immersion that I admit is somewhat hard to do when watching it and feeling justified comparing it to shows that are nothing like it. \nIt really is one of a kind, and should be watched with patience, enthusiasm, and not so much hype as to ruin the experience. \nThe rebuild series only expands the canon and what's really going on. Evangelion is not a show you watch the whole way through and say \"well that was alright\". It's a show that will be up for discussion for a great length of time, and will forever in my eyes be seen as a classic among anime, animated picture, and art.\nEvangelion's a show that I have experienced on a personal level. The feelings of failure, fear, weakness, and not knowing one's true self are ones all people are familiar with. It's a show that questions human motivation, science, religion and....I just realized I'm talking way too long about a series that really speaks for itself. \nIf you're reading this and shaking your head, if you don't like it, that's alright but I will forever think of it as a classic, and my personal favorite. \n        "},

For me,the story on its own isn't that great,but the characters were so well-developed to fit the story. The art is pretty awesome for an anime that's 22 years old by now. The soundtracks of this film is what got me into it in the first place. The opening song of this will forever be one of my favourites.My English is not good enough to express the greatness of its soundtracks. \nIt's a must-watch classic,even if you hate it,you'll love it in one way or\n          \n        another.\n        "},

Complex and well developed characters with lots of emotions involved. \nA lot of concepts and ideas that are quite original, for sure a very different sort of anime, and for sure a mysterious plot that drags you along. I for sure clung to the characters and something happened to me that's rare to happen when I'm watching anything: I was bound to the characters, I developed affection towards Shinji, Misato, Asuka and to a lesser extent to Rei as well. \nI'm impressive anime for sure. My big disappointment, however, is what disappointed pretty much everyone who watched\n          \n        NGE: The final is fucked up and even NGE: End of Evangelion didn't fix it, because I like things to be conclusive towards the end of a show. But NGE is the sort of show the drags you into the story, brings you a lot of emotions and surprises. but gives no conclusions whatsoever. And that doesn't only happen to the plot as a whole, but to the entire cast it is likewise, meaning that the relationships never get to a conclusion. \nAnother point to notice that kind of annoys me is that almost every single character in this show is psychologically disturbed, to a lesser or greater extent, which in turns them more human, however it is annoying because their psychological issues get in the way of the events going forward and it never changes too much. That's especially the case with Shinji Icari, he's the first protagonist I've ever seen who totally lacks the balls to be in the position he is, which is not only annoying in itself, but it also bugs me that unlike what's expected of him, he never superates it, and in fact it seems to get worse in the end of the series.\nSame with Asuka, that's a hell of a personality. Again I can not blame her. She is a very traumatised girl, but the way that gets in her way is too much and towards the end of the series she - like most of the characters - is situated in a quite of a sad situation, something which is very peculiar about NGE: there's no happy ending, for no one...\nOverall, a good show because of how catchy the characters are, a must watch because of how unique it is, for sure. However I can't say I was satisfied with how weird, inconclusive and fucked up it ends, therefore I think it's far from deserving an excellent rate. \n        "},

It was said to the public that the Second Impact was caused by a meteor. But the truth was far much worse.\nThe show started as a Shounen. You can see that from the first episode (by the way, for me the show begins at episode 14). But the writers life took an unexpected turn. His mother died at the Asylum and he was deeply affected from that. And he started to get serious. The show turned to a Psi-Thriller, and there were a lot of questions. What were\n          \n        Angels? What is Adam? What is Lilith? I'm leaving those questions to you. Think a little bit about them, if you can't find the answers post a comment and I will answer them for you.\nThe show ended really bad. Yeah, the psi thing was exciting at first, but there were so many unanswered questions. And instead of answering those, the writer made a very disappointing ending. (well, it was not like the writer wanted to end the show like that, the anime's budget was close to a bankrupt, so the team filled the last episodes with poses of the characters from different angles, drawing of landscapes etc.)\nThe series does not end there however. You can watch the Death& Rebith and The End of Evangelion. I will not talk about them in this review but I strongly recommend you to watch The End of Evangelion.\nThe main character of this show is, Ikari Shinji. And he is the most insecure, emo protagonist in the history of animes. You will see what I meant when you watch the show.\nIf you are wondering why I gave a 10 for the Character section when I hate the main character this much, it's because of the side characters. Everyone of them have different backgrounds, dreams, and lifeviewes.\nAs for the Verdict, I will have to say that this anime is absouletly great and spectacular. Watch.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    No doubt one of the most controversial as well as infamous anime of all time. It's the Marmite of anime, you're either going to love it, or hate it. I myself absolutely adore Evangelion. It wraps up mecha battling awesomeness along with the psychological trauma an adolescent would feel if the fate of the planet rested on whether or not they lose a battle. And it does it magnificently.\nNow, I can perfectly understand why many people despise the series, it has a pretty poor fanbase who usually lash out whenever it's criticised and claim that the series is misunderstood and people simply don't \"get\" it,\n          \n        and the later half of the series switches tone massively along with a big drop in animation quality. There's a scene in an elevator later on which seems like it goes on forever, where nobody speaks nor makes any movement, only the occasional cough. This was down to the budget drop, but it no doubt makes the series a little worse for many people.\nThe story is fairly typical fr the first half; school kids have to pilot giant robots to fight the big monsters that'll destroy the planet. But halfway through, the series takes a massive turn, delving into the minds of each main character, highlighting the trauma and stress that's been forced on them at such young ages, along with past issues such as Shinji's relationship with his father or Asuka's mother when she was a child. The story overall is very good, but is slightly weighed down by the straightforward first half.\nThe soundtrack on the otherhand is outstanding, each track is perfectly used for any situation, it conveys the emotion felt by the characters and the dire situations they're thrusted into perfectly. The main theme is oddly upbeat, somewhat unfitting for the latter half of the series, but is nonetheless a great  piece of music. \nThe first half of the series has very good art, especially for the time, but as I've already said in the latter half it takes quite a big quality drop, using black a great deal more than it used to and in general being quite poor when compared with earlier episodes. But it's still bearable and is no reason not to give the series a try.\nThe characters is what Eva excels at the most, it really highlights just how stressed and traumatised each character is, why they are how they are, why Shinji hates his father but still seeks for his approval, why Asuka acts so cocky and moody, why Rei is so quiet but rarely seems nervous or happy.\nAll in all, I love this series, but can definitely understand it's faults and understand why many people dislike it.   \n        "},

It's a suspense story where thin mechas and giant aliens come into play, along with a government sponsored organization that is doing some experiments that are all tied to one big dark project that may change the course of life as we know it. Now that we have that let's add an emotional boy who has some adolescent crisis and issues with\n          \n        his dad but maybe it's more psychological intricate than that.\nThe story is great, but the pacing is very uneven and unnecessarily complex at times, the art is amazing, specially in the 'monsters' and mecha designs. The sound does it for the psychological parts as well for the battles and tension scenes. Characters are again complex, having all of them different reasons or motivation to play a role in NERV and a different perception of the occurrences in the time of the story.\nIf you come here to watch an action mecha you'll be disappointed, instead you'll find a series where mechas are important but not the main element of it. This series takes religious and scientific matters to a point where we can't be sure if they are being too serious about it to start off. It has very awesome ups, and some really sad downs, but all of it serves for a different experience brought to you by Gainax. By the way, some subjects are based from Top Wo Neare: Gunbusters. this is a series you'll love or hate, but always give it a proper try.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Neon Genesis Evangelion, a controversial anime since its inception.  For some people, NGE is art at its purest form; the feelings and frustrations of its creator shaped appropriately to fit in a medium (in this case, animation). For others, it is just another anime struggling to draw the viewer's attention by presenting itself as \"deep\". In this review I will explain why I personally disagree with the latter and give reasons as to why I have given it a perfect score.\nStory: 8/10\nIn my opinion the weakest part of NGE is its story. For its first quarter, the series is pretty story-driven as it introduces\n          \n        you to the post-apocalyptic modern world as well as the characters in it. For the majority of the show however, the story only acts as a vehicle for explaining the director's philosophies. That's not to say that the plot doesn't steadily move from point A towards point B, but that the main focus of the series lies within its characters.\nArt: 10/10\nThe art is pretty solid for its time. You'll find attention to detail everywhere and constant beautiful shots of both landscapes and characters masterfully directed by Hideaki Anno. In addition, the animation doesn't hold back when there's a lot of action on screen, allowing you to experience the show as intended.\nTowards the end, the production infamously ran out of budget after a controversy surrounding the direction the series was taking, forcing the animation to recycle frames and draw some scenes out more than usual. However, by that point,  all of this works in favor of the series as I'm sure you'll see if you decide to watch it.\nSound: 10/10\nNot much to explain here. The soundtrack and the opening perfectly fit the tone of the series and often set a great mood, while the calm ending (a cover of the famous Kaye Ballard song \"Fly Me To The Moon\") intends to give the viewer a moment's rest following the episode.\nCharacters: 10/10\nThe strongest trait of Evangelion. Unlike almost every anime series up to that point, the main characters in NGE are weak and broken. This offers the show a feeling of mortality; there are no heroes.\n Shinji Ikari, the character we follow most throughout the show happens to be the weakest one. Neglected since childhood, he wishes he could make good friends, but his self-pity and somewhat annoying character prevents him from doing so. Extreme as it may seem, Shinji's feelings are things we have all experienced and attempted to hide at least once in our lives. Hideaki Anno takes these feelings and puts them in the spotlight, preventing us from looking away. This induces a very uncomfortable feeling, especially when watching Shinji isolate himself or run away from responsibility as a means to be noticed by his father. At the end of the day, Shinji is annoying to everyone because he is the embodiment of everything you've tried to hide and run away from. That's what Anno intended.\nThere's not just Shinji however. The way characters interact with each other, their developement and their struggles all give the viewer a glimpse of the kind of world they've had to live in. More often than not, their decisions seem wrong, but make us wonder if we would have actually done anything differently in their shoes.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nThis is very different for everyone. The anime's mostly phylosophical themes as well as its weak-willed characters make it hard for it to be an \"enjoyable\" experience in the literal sense of the word. It's not something you'd watch when you want to lift your spirits up. It is however a very significant work as it redefines the word \"art\" when it comes to anime. That being said, if you think this is a mecha anime similar to Gundam, you'll be dissapointed. \nOverall: 10/10\nSimilarly to the works of David Lynch or Darren Aronofsky, this anime exists to convey a message, not to present a story. The anime is based on a solid story nonetheless and even if it gets harder and harder to grasp as Anno stops narrating the story traditionally, there are still visual hints solving any questions you might have if you immerse yourself in the post-apocalyptic world of NGE. \nNGE is a milestone in anime history and even though I definetely wouldn't recommend it to a newcomer, it's definetely worth watching as it presents you with more than just another anime. It exposes you to art.\n        "},

I am impressed by composition of still frame with highlight of light and shadow, and sophisticated-designed background conveys strong psychological feeling of characters to audiences. I remember there is a shot of big ward with only a bed in the middle\n          \n        in a small portion of the shot, while other part is fill with grey light, which expresses an extremely depressed emotion of main character who just wake up out of his nightmare. There is another impressive shot. Instead of making a conversation with general shot and reverse shot, it only displays a still frame with two characters in the same shot, and one is under bright light and the other one is in the dark, this high-contrasted division of a frame implicitly indicates the relationship of two characters and their dialogues.  Shinji is in the dark side--implies his cowardice, disturbance, despair and decadence, as a dichotomy to that Misato is in the bright side--implies encourage, hope, and determination. Also, there are some appropriate and subtle application of techniques; Character is in the foreground with distorted perspective which also enlarges the background, audiences can directly feel the rage of the character. i can still show more examples, you can talk by message me. By the way, watch the animes before EVA, few of them can really show emotion of characters via creating a particular environment (or, more cinematic, via mise-en-scence) .\nnarrative has unique style and also emphasize the emotion of character. I remember there are more than 3 episodes merely talking about the \"world\" in mind of one character, it is totally new and crazy at that time. In episode 17, the entire episode doesn't mention anything about Touji Suzuhara in the cockpit, rather descride emergency of outside situation and struggle of Shinji to make audiences feeling nervous as characters in that anime world. Since audiences don't know everything in that episode and they are eager to know what happens to Touji Suzuhara, and this feeling transfers audiences' original point of view from audience to someone in anime world. What audience cares and knows is the same as the characters, right? \nsakuga is fantastic, especially in acting scenes and some fighting scenes, but sometimes it shows its bad quality because of lack of money, yeah, i choose to forgive it.\nabout thought, i believe it talks about the unknowable yet close relationship among people and how the world is too absurd to grasp. This theme is similar to what Camus discusses, i suggest you can read his books and then watch EVA again.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This is my first review on this site, so here goes nothing.\nI'm going to start by saying that I didn't expect to enjoy this series.  It didn't even look like the kind of thing I'd attempt watching.  But enjoy it I did, immensely so.\nStory: 9/10\nThe story was a bit convoluted, it wasn't exceedingly easy to follow, but for me that is not at all a turn off.  I only mention it because I assume it is a turn off for others.  In any case, it possessed a good, thoughtful plot that made at least some sense as it went from point\n          \n        A to point B, which many anime fail to achieve.  I hear a lot of people complaining about the last couple of episodes, how they make no sense and have no interesting elements.  To me, those episodes were the most enjoyable out of all of the series.  I enjoy immensely an anime that makes you think, and this one, especially those last couple episodes, did indeed do that.  There were several problems I noticed with the plot though, specifically the last happening before the identity crisis episodes.  I'm not going to mention the event because spoilers, but I don't need to mention it to explain my distaste about it.  I mean, seriously?  Trying to make viewers feel affection and connection to a character, and having a game changing event surround them in the span of a single episode?  It is just not going to work.  I mean, it was pulled off as well as it possibly could be, but that is not very well at all.  All it really succeeded in doing was making me mad.  The other problems I noticed weren't very major, the story is great, and even that huge fuckup isn't enough to bring my rating below a 9.\nOh, and I'd like to comment on the identity crisis episodes(mentioning these isn't spoiling, right?)  I was on the edge of my seat during these more than any battle during the series.  In a way, this is the most important and action-packed battle taking place during the series, even though there isn't a single Angel being fought against.  It was pulled off well and everything, and belied deep psychological messages that I have not been able to decode all of.\nArt 10/10\nOn a shallow level, I give the art a seven.  That is, compared to the much better artstyle of modern anime.  On a deeper level, it deserves a ten.  I loved the flashing visuals in the opening and throughout the series, and the many original and unique techniques used within the identity crisis episodes.  The animation was fluid enough to not distract, and the colors(I think its the colors that are really different about older anime) weren't as horrible as other anime of its time that I have seen.  \nI know it doesn't quite fit under 'Art,' and would perhaps fit better under 'Character,' but nonetheless I would like to tackle the design of the suits and Angels and the Evas here.  I liked the designs of the Evas a lot, they sort of fit with their pilots in a certain way, or at least supplement them.  I don't know if it's just me, but I think a lot of thought was put into coloring and overall design here.  The suits just looked cool, and fit with the Evas, I don't know if it goes beyond that.(sometimes I thought I sensed color symbolism)  Oh, and the Angels.  I really appreciated the variety in the Angels, it turned them from being 'an enemy force to think about' to 'individual villains to think about,' which isn't something you'd expect to see.  Some of the designs were silly or lacking, though, but perhaps in itself that has its own reasoning.\nSound 8/10\nI'm going to be honest; I'm not sure what to put here.  I guess I'll go with music.  The opening was fantastic.  The beat is STILL stuck in my head.  The soundtrack throughout the episodes was great as well.  However, I despise the ending theme.  It wasn't ear-catching, and just sounded basically annoying.  Doesn't even come close to the opening.\nCharacter 10/10\nIt will not suffice to say that 'the characters' personalities in Eva were great and I liked them.'  I'm going to go through the main characters that impacted me the most one at a time, instead.\nShinji:\nI hear a lot of people complaining how whiny Shinji is.  He isn't 'whiny'.  At least I didn't think so.  It came off more as 'ordinary person with insecurities in an extraordinary, stressing situation.'  Shinji wasn't meant to be a natural hero, but a normal person with issues we all have, brought into the boots of a hero by both choice and circumstance.  If Shinji really was whiny, he would have left for good, and refuse to be the hero.\nAsuka:\nSeems like everyone either hates her because she's a bitch, or loves her because she's tsundere.  I have neither opinion, but I'd like to comment on the tsundere thing.  There is no doubt that Asuka is a tsundere, but I don't think that should define her, she's far from a simple archetype character.  And while she was quite a slap-happy, bitchy character, that's not the 'point' of her either.  No, in fact the small pieces of her past that we are given are the centrepoint of Asuka, the place of her character.  I could give more details, but I won't to avoid spoilers.\nRei:\nOkay, she's a kuudere.  Yes, I love kuuderes.  Yes, Rei is one of my favorite characters, yes, I like her because she's a kuudere.  No, that still shouldn't define her.  Rei has one of the most important roles in the story of Eva, and I still am not quite sure the entirety of her role.  In any case, she is a girl who does what she's told.  But why?  That 'but why,' is the question that defines Rei, and can be applied to many of the other happenings in the series.\nI want to tackle many of the other characters, but I also don't want to make this review too long, so I'll leave it at those important three.  I considered talking about the other Children, but I haven't unraveled their importances quite enough yet to comment.\nOverall 9/10\nI loved this anime, but the big mess up before the last few episodes and the hated ED was enough to bring my rating down to a 9/10.  Sowwy.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    There is a reason Eva is considered anime's masterpiece. It is probably the most dedicated character study in the medium, and it uses its in depth analysis of its relatable characters to present sentiments that are intrinsic to the human condition. At first it presents the typical aspects of the mecha genre as a fun power fantasy. However, the focus quickly shifts as our our heroes are crushed by feelings of doubt, loneliness, and self-hate, mirroring the fears we all hold in our hearts. While these feelings stem from their past experiences, they are worsened by the pressures of being the bulwark between mankind and\n          \n        its encroaching doom at the hands of enigmatic otherworldy beings. In this sense, Eva is something of a deconstruction of the genre, ultimately caring more about people's psychology than depicting big robots fighting bigger monsters. Despite the story being one regarding an inconcievably dire existential threat to humanity, it is grounded because it is almost impossible for an honest viewer to not see pieces of themselves in our flawed heroes. All coming age stories dwell on the doubts of their adoloscent protagonists, but Eva looks at these characters in such an empathetic way that it transcends the regular trappings of those sorts of stories and offers a look at people in general. I can't think of another story that manages to simultaneously be so grandiose, and yet so dedicated to the feelings of individuals. Although its opinion of people can often be grim in comparison to that of most other stories, it comes across mostly as genuine, rather than purely cynical. While its pacing may be slow, and its plot tough to follow, Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most ambitious and rewarding pieces of fiction ever created.\n*Note: Also the OP is magnificent.\n        "},

Probably one of the best anime I've ever watch\nStory: 9/10\nVery great, the story begins from shounen-like story: a young boy who suddenly recruited to be a giant robot who destroy monsters and then he has allies of two other pilots. But, the story suddenly changing near the mid-end to a more psychological-seinen one in very satisfying way. Nevertheless, the ending will make people hate this anime because of the ambiguous end (even though the ending can be clarified ater watching The End of The Evangelion). Basically it's 10/10 for\n          \n        me but -1 for the ending.\nArt:9/10\nSuperb art. Very nice expressions and drawing of the characters. I give 9/10 for current anime standarad, however if compared with 90's anime average, I will give it 10/10.\nSound: 10/10\nNice sound, especially the sound background in tense conditions. I like the opening OST which fits well with the overall story theme and possibly foreshadow the climax part of the story.\nCharacter: 10/10\nPerfect, that's all I can say. All of relevant characters involved in the story has character developments they deserved. This anime put depth on each character so every character psychology and personality can be deeply understood.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nFrom ease to tense, this anime makes you enjoy to watch it continuously until the end.\nOverall: 10/10\nMasterpiece, the revolutionary anime which inspires many animes/mangas to make such character as Rei/Asuka/Shinji. If you are looking for the best anime, or why you should watch anime, or looking for good a giant-robot anime, this would be your best choice.\n        "},

So my impression and understanding about this anime suprisingly different than from the first time I watch it. Why?\nAt first, actually I don't really understand what I'm watching, what I know is the story is crazy and confusing.\nBut now, years later, when I watched it again I do still think the story was crazy. But now I can see how depth the story is, why they want to built the Eva (sort of),\n          \n        how humanity destroy their mind, phsycological issue each characters have.\nIt is one of the anime that will give you different impression each time you watch it. So there will always something to talk or discuss about it everytime you finished watching it. Because you will have different frame of mind as time goes by, and it will give you different side of point.\nThe artwork complimented the story. It was released in the 90's, so it was so classic and I think it serves the story well.\nThe music score really fits the story. And I still listen to the opening song until now.\nThe story was undoubtly a great one. I never find a story as deep and controversial as Eva. But Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the one that I think can stand hand in hand with Eva. \nThe first time Eva-01 going berserk is one of my favourite scene in an anime. \nIf many people call Eva was a masterpiece. I agree with them.\nI recommended it. \n        "},

He loves, reflects, talks nonsense things, denies their future ... is a fascinatingly complex creature.\nMisato is the semi-mother figure of Shinji, she is\n          \n        very likable and sometimes nasty, their relationship is very good to see.\nGendo is one of the coolest characters ever, very manipulative and ambiguous; It seems so soulless, but is one of the most humans of the series.\nRei Ayanami is a blank paper, her life is in our hands.\nAsuka Langley Soryu, the fans fav character is a reflex of them, she is very egoistic and exhibitionist.\nThe soundtrack and sound effects are amazing, Fly me to the Moon is an unforgettable ending song; the animation it's a little dated but not compromise the work.\nThe famous EVA fights are incredibly tense and savage.\nI love episodes 25-26, they are able to change the thinking about the life of anyone, is the opus of the existentialism, no words can describe the happiness of the Shinji utopia in constrast of the series at all. The abdication of science and religion in favor of the comfort of mind is amazing.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is not a Sci-Fi Mecha series, it's a masterpiece about society, about viewpoints... And above all, about Life.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Warning, some spoilers. \nI think the breakdown for fans of this anime is very simple.  I see two types of people when it comes to thoughts about this anime; extreme love or dissatisfaction.  It's in my opinion that this is due to whether or not you can empathize the characters.  More specifically though, it just boils down to Shinji Ikari.\nShinji Ikari is the product of a person that has lost all hope in the world, and is content being out of the limelight.  Once he's been thrust into the limelight by his father Gendo Ikari who has Shinji brought to NERV\n          \n        headquarters do we really start understanding Shinji and how weak he is.  \nFor a lot of people that have dealt with little to no issues when it comes to self confidence, it'd probably be difficult to understand why Shinji is the way he is, and more importantly why it's not pathetic.  If you're a person that's ever dealt with depression, in my honest opinion, I think you'll really enjoy Shinji Ikari.  \nIn order to enjoy watching Shinji be miserable, it'd probably help if you're an emotional viewer and not a technical viewer.  I myself an am emotional viewer, whereas I don't get annoyed by what a lot of people find to be \"whining\" from Shinji.  \nWhen it comes to the Mecha fight scenes they're without a doubt my favorite when it comes to the Mecha's I've seen.  Not only do the battles display entertaining action between whatever the Mecha's are fighting, you're also witnessing a mental battle with the 13 year-old child that's being manipulated to pilot the \"Evangelion\".  \nOne thing I find unique about the mecha in this anime is that they're living organism's, and to make it more interesting, they're clones of an alien that nearly wiped out the entire population on earth.  How cool is that?  It get's better.  If the pilot has a mental breakdown the mecha's follow suit and go into a \"berserk\" mode.  \nI'm not really an expert when it comes to anime art but for when the anime was made, I think the art is excellent.  Still to this day everything on the anime looks futuristic, aside from the actual year the movie takes place.  The mecha are done very well, not perfect, but to my liking.  \nOnce again, not an expert when it comes to sound quality, but I will say I enjoyed the climatic music during the fight scenes, primarily the scenes where Eva Unit-01 is involved, which is most of them.  \nI apologize if my review has grammatical errors.  The last thing I want to say is how much I enjoyed this anime.  This is the anime that got me into anime, and still to this day it is my favorite.  \nIf you haven't watched this anime, at least give it a chance!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I find myself struggling to write this, largely because I absolutely adore this series. It is much easier to review a series I didn't care for and list off merits and faults. As I see it, with Evangelion there are two types of people with regards to this show, you either hype the show up, or you complain that the show is overhyped, I'll try to be neither for the sake of objectivity. Oh and probably some minor spoilers, no details I promise.\nStory: The story overall is fantastic, it follows a 14 year old boy Shinji Ikari as he pilots the Evangelion unit 1, essentially\n          \n        a giant mech, to fight the angels, creatures of unknown origin that one by one launch their assaults on NERV, the organisation that oversees the Evangelion project. He is joined by fellow 14 year old pilots Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langly Soryu. Why 15 year olds? Well in the words of the series, \"We must use fourteen year olds.\" Works for me. As the series progresses it moves more and more to focusing on the characters as they... Erm... Well... Develop... Instead of the battles with the angels. Oh and I'll talk about the ending towards the end... It's special...\nArt: Was phenomenal! Well, I mean when they were drawing the battle scenes... Those were really something. The level of detail there is truly above and beyond. As for the rest of it, it's mostly still good! But well... There were problems. Curse you limited budgets! There are numerous instances of characters holding things over their mouth to speak, which for the most part isn't too distracting, but two scenes in particular stand out. In both of these they play a static image for far too long with only background noise playing, one is at the train platform and the other is in an elevator. The other point where the art really slides is at the ending but more on that in a minute.\nSound: The theme song is a classic at this point, even Cartoon Network's \"Regular Show\" did a spin off of the opening sequence. Personally I love the rest of the songs on the soundtrack as well. Shiro Sagisu is a fantastic composer and his songs fit very nicely with the mood. This is one of the few shows that I've watched with the dub track as well as the subtitles and it is actually pretty good. It struggles at the beginning, but after only a few episodes the voice actors really start to match their role.\nCharacter: Shinji is not your average protagonist with confidence and all the answers. Rather Shinji is a coward who has to remind himself \"I mustn't run away.\" He is balanced by Asuka, who exhibits confidence to to point of arrogance, and Rei, who was designed to fall into the uncanny valley, but has actually spawned off her own character type. Most everybody gets frusterated with Shinji and initially hates Asuka, but part of the beauty of this pilot team, from a story point of view, is that they're imperfect, they don't have all of the answers, and this conflict of personalities causes clashes. The characters all have depth to their personalities which is only revealed as the series progresses and this depth is impressive in itself.\nThe Ending: This is one of the original Gainax endings, endings that leave you confused and oftentimes disappointed. I will admit that after the last episode I sat staring at my screen slack-jawed where I said to myself \"what the f*** did I just watch.\" The art for much of the episode quite literally appears to be black sharpie on printer paper. I don't want to go into the details, but in essence it's an abstract ending and nobody understands it for sure. If you're looking for something a little more concrete watch End of Evangelion... Though that has its own set of questions. That being said this ending is one of my guilty pleasures, Anno always says that Eva must mean something different to everyone and watching the ending and finding out what it means to me is something I enjoy doing.\nConclusion: I love this show, however I recognise that other people have different views and that the ending can be disappointing. All in all it was hugely influential, it is an effective deconstruction of the mech genre and it is massively hyped. Because of its infulence, everybody should watch it, if not only to catch the references that are scattered across other shows. \n        "},
