    When I first saw the movie, I didn't see what the big deal was. All right, so a girl gets whisked away to a fantasy world? We've heard that story before. And, unlike many other movies, there's no dramatic love story or epic battles and action scenes to keep you at the edge of your seat. Consequently, I didn't think of it as being very exciting.\
Still, I watched it again and, for some reason, I got it the second time around. Spirited Away isn't meant to be anything grand, with all the bells and whistles. It has a quiet, subdued way of telling a simple\
          \
        story about a simple girl in a very strange world. Instead of expecting something huge, just sit back, watch, and appreciate the world and story Miyazaki has finely crafted for us all to enjoy.\
To get to the technical aspects...\
The art is, of course, amazing. The colours are rich and the animation is fluid. When Chihiro and her family first walk into the spirit world, you can practically feel the breeze as you watch it whisk through the grass. The lights of the spirit world at night are breathtaking. And watching the train ride closer to the end of the movie, coupled with the amazing music score (the track is called 'The Sixth Station'), remains one of my most favourite animation sequences out of anything I've seen. Which brings me to another point: the music.\
I will get this out of the way first - Joe Hisaishi is one of my favourite composers. His music style is very simple, but he makes every note count. Most of his music is quite subdued in nature and takes a careful ear to notice when your eyes are being captivated by what's going on in the screen, but do take notice if you have the chance. Or search on YouTube for videos of his live performances. His music is a joy to listen to. Like with Spirited Away, Hisaishi's music lacks all the 'bells and whistles' per se, but it's beauty lies in its simplicity. Hisaishi has not failed here in Spirited Away.\
I dearly loved the characters. One of the best parts of this movie, for me, was that it lacked any clear good or evil characters. Everyone has a bit of both, though perhaps some allow the evil sides of them to come out a bit more obviously than others. In this way, it's very realistic. Granted, the characters were all quite predictable and Chihiro grated on my nerves at times, but overall, I enjoyed each and every one of the characters Miyazaki has create here.\
Overall, Spirited Away is one of my favourite movies and will always be a treasured item in my small DVD collection. It requires some patience to get through since it's not packed with action or drama, but it's a nice fairy tale to watch and enjoy.\

    This is my first review in MyAnimeList, so I apologize in advance if you find the ideas I'll put forward here badly-written, explained or structured.\
I am going to talk about Spirited Away (yeah, obvious). It's been quite a long time since I watched it for the last time, more than a year in fact; but I became a really fascinating and influential piece for me at that time, far enough to define my current love for Miyazaki's works, the Studio Ghibli and animation in general as an art and a strong way of expression. Today it's still one of my favorite animated features of any\
          \
        sort, and not because of its lack of flaws than its amazing blend of concepts.\
The first thing that appeals the audience in this movie is its art and animation. I, as unexperienced and poor in technical knowledge about the subject, think it's utter fascinating, it manages to create a whole world out of nothing, and the use of lights and shades, the forms and colours make the overall experience a visual joy. And in addition to that I find the characters' gestures and movements extremely plastic and realistic, some other scenes have been mentioned in that aspect by other reviewers but I was particularly fond of that one where Chihiro is walking with her parents and she gradually moves away, only to come back to her position with a little run-up. These things don't happen, usually, in animation. In so far as they are unnecessary, easily ignorable and feel like a waste of resources, we hardly see characters making these little movements which in the end result in nothing relevant. Ghibli, however, animates them, and does it with such a mastery, a love for detail and a goddamn naturalism that I can't help but feel amazed.\
As if the visual aspect wasn't good enough, the movie is also a pleasure for our ears and has what I consider the best track of my heavily worshipped Joe Hisaishi, one of the best (if not the best) film composers I have ever heard. Spirited Away is exceptionally good at that aspect; I'd say it's one of the very few cases in which there is, at some scenes, such a strong fusion between story and music, that I can't conceive nor think of one without the other.\
But despite all of these beautiful qualities about its setting, the real substance of this movie is at its story. I apologize in advance, again, because as I'm going to develop some points I will give some free spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie I'd recommend to stop reading at this point.\
It has been said many times by critics that Spirited Away felt like a senseless blend of magic elements, just a simple story filled with many things the author introduced undiscriminatingly to drag out the experience. Well, I have a quite different point of view for that device. I just can't conceive that the animation, for example, is taken to such a high level of detail and, on the other hand, that doesn't happen with the story. And by rewatching it repeatedly in a short amount of time (once every two months, more or less), I began to develop some theories about the nature of the world that is depicted here.\
What must be considered at first is that all this magical world, with strange creatures and spells, is just an allegory for the always difficult transiton between childhood and the first steps of adulthood. It's the age you start dealing with responsibility, when you realize your acts have consequences and you have to make decisions that will affect your future; you define yourself and the course of your life. Miyazaki puts these simple concepts by transforming the need of finding an identity into a way to escape the wonderful yet cruel world where Chihiro is suddenly trapped. Its hostility imitates quite well the drama of the process, as it reinforces the need of an additional effort every one of us have to make at some point and reset our lives and our positions.\
Does this mean that Yubaba's world is an undeveloped blend of magic, hostile things that only serve as a situation that Chihiro has to overcome at some point? Well, I don't think so, as it seems to have a clear structure and hierarchy. One of the stories I see compared more often with this one is Alice in Wonderland. However, I would define that as a blend of unrelated events, a story whose main charm lies in its anarchic, nearly nightmarish, narrative. Spirited Away is not like that in any way. In fact I think there is an effort to transmit a strong sense of logic throughout, it tries to delimit the causes and consequences of every single case.\
The key character to understand how Yubaba's tyranny works is, in my opinion, Lin. She just happens to be the link between Chihiro and the rest of the magical creatures, just like somebody that is in some sort of intermediate level. Her physical appearance looks slightly transformed, but not as much as the rest. She is aware of the existence of another world outside of that one, the importance of remembering her name, her \"identity\"; and knowing that, she helps Chihiro and takes the role of a mother. I have the theory that every one of the creatures that live in Yubaba's world were once human, maybe little boys and girls like Chihiro who couldn't find the way to escape, or other people; and they ended up forgetting who they were, losing their \"humanity\" and becoming mere pieces of this world. Lin is a special case because it seems she's not lost her identity yet, at least not at all, but forgot at one point her name, the key to come back home, and knows her situation is irreversible. She maybe observed this in some of her companions when she arrived, and Chihiro reminds herself of that. Maybe because of that, because she knows and appreciates what she's doomed to lose, she decides to help her in an altruistic way.\
And what about Kamaji? Another key character in Chihiro's development in there; he seems to be quite aware of his situation too. I'd say he is a bit like the \"sacrificed\" individual, who Yubaba used to start his project and maybe the only one that didn't lose his identity at all. He's a slave in this world, he knows it but can't help it.\
So yes, I have a more \"adult\" and crude view of the overall concept. This definition of the magical public baths as a place were people are doomed to end up losing what makes them \"special\" is quite harsh and melancholic for a -as targeted and admitted by Miyazaki- kid's movie, and it might feel even weird, but that's how I interpreted it and I think it makes some sense.\
Does this mean Yubaba is a villain? Well, define villain. Somebody whose only objective in life is to harm people? That's hardly what Yubaba is. She, for better or for worse, created a world, and made it work. She imposed some rules. We could even say she created her own utopia (and that doesn't mean she is naturally \"bad\"), why not? And, most important, she has a strong sense of honor, she dictates and also OBEYS her rules. One of the (maybe) main reasons why she loses her battle against Chihiro, in fact, is that her weakness is shown eventually (giant baby); and reveals a hypocritical attitude, as she is protecting her lovely child from any influence while she's always preaching the exact contrary. As she knows it, it's a shameful thing to admit and maybe here is where her image of forcefulness starts to teeter.\
All in all, these examples just show that the real strength of this story lies in the characters, as they are always depicted in a detailed way. Yubaba not being the typical villain, or not even being a \"villain\" at all; Haku, the hero and the \"positive\" one here has also an overambitious side and is for the most part guilty of his situation... and Chihiro, of course. She is a spoiled brat who learns to appreciate some things, but in no way overreacting at these points, as she sounds real and relatable at every damn scene. It's quite easy to understand her, she's not made to be likeable but her portrayal is solid enough to make us join her development through the story.\
I could spend hours and hours talking about this precious anime and its many details, the enigmatic role of No Face, the negative influence of the parents in Chihiro's behaviour, and so much more... I love it. It breathes mastery at (almost) every one of its points, and I can enjoy it in many levels. My only grip would be the way things are resolved, which I have always found too rushed; reading Miyazaki's opinion on that ending I've come to understand the intention behind, but still I'd say the metaphor is made too subtle for the audience, and maybe the execution is also somewhat clumsy. But aside from this minor flaw, I can't help but admire this fascinating, eye-captivating piece of art, my second favorite anime behind Grave Of The Fireflies.\

    This is like watching a dream. Sometimes when you have those moments where you picture something then you say to yourself that was not reality, the image that came to my mind must be from a different world that I saw somewhere, but not that I can recall when or where. This is like opening a door deep down in your mind and behind that door lies all your lucid dreams and imaginations. watch it for sure, you can never go wrong with this.\
I enjoyed this very much. You will experience all kind of different feelings watching this; fear, love, warmth..etc \

    In many ways this is a difficult review to write.  This is because I&rsquo;m clearly not the target audience, as Spirited Away is a film that is clearly targeted towards children.  In the end, I simply decided to review the film as I normally do and leave a disclaimer about not being the target audience.\
I first watched this film 5 years ago during my senior year in high school when a friend of mine was raving about it.  Back then I found the film to be boring and feature a paper thin plot.  Now 5 years later and a few hundred\
          \
        anime titles later I was compelled to review this.  However, since it was 5 years since I viewed the film, I decided to re-watch Spirited Away in preparation for this review as my memory is a bit foggy.  After watching it again, I discovered 2 things about Spirited Away.  I now know why I forgotten many of the events, thus needed to re-watch it and my perspective about the film really hasn&rsquo;t changed. \
Spirited Away begins with Chihiro&rsquo;s family moving to their new home.  Like any normal 10 years old girl she is quite sadden and angry about leaving her old life (hell anyone would feel this way).  Chihiro&rsquo;s father makes a wrong turn somewhere and decides to take a short cut through the forest.  Ok, perfectly normal but what gets me is when they see an abandon building they decided to go in and explore.  Next, they go, &ldquo;oh look food that&rsquo;s sitting out with no-one around&rdquo; let eat.  The events leading up to Chihiro getting trapped in the fantasy world are way too plot devicy for my taste.  However, this isn&rsquo;t my main complaint about the film, it&rsquo;s just that the rest is so shallow I can&rsquo;t really analyze it with much depth.  The rest of the story can be summarized by Chihiro get a jobs, does a job, returns something, get freed and goes home.  In fact, I&rsquo;m quite dumfounded as to how they created a 2 hour movie with this plot line.\
Although, perhaps I&rsquo;m being too critical with the story and story structure that Spirited Away takes.  What I think Spirited Away tries to do is create a magical world in which the viewer can escape to.  It tries to take us on an adventure to somewhere very different.  That is does, studio Ghibli creates a worlds that is both imaginative and beautiful.  I could go on and on about the world but words wouldn&rsquo;t do it justice.  However, something is very wrong when the only major praise I can give is about the fantasy world that is created.  They spend way too much time creating and focusing on this world.  When I analyze a few scenes I realize how drawn out Spirited Away makes each scene.  They could have easily cut 30-40 minutes and have a more focused story.  This is how they were able to stretch such a thin plot out for 2 hours.\
When reviewing anime I put the most weight on the plot and characters.  I&rsquo;ve already talked about how thin and weak the plot is in the above paragraphs.  Sadly the characters don&rsquo;t fare too much better.  Chihiro does grow over the course of the movie and in the end she is a bit stronger and can now face new challenges (i.e. new school, neighborhood, etc).  After going through what she went through, I don&rsquo;t think a new school will faze her.  However, there really isn&rsquo;t much to Chihiro&rsquo;s character, she&rsquo;s simply a random girl that happens to go on an inadvertent adventure and becomes a little bit stronger in the end.  She feels a bit like an empty shell for the audience to live through.  In general, the characterization for the movie feels a bit weak, I mean do we really know these characters?  If that&rsquo;s all there is to these characters, then I have no choice but to conclude that most of them are extremely flat.  \
Ok now on to the easy part of this review, the technical aspects.  It should be no surprise that the animation and art is top notch.  This is studio Ghibli and Spirited Away is also a movie so there should be no excuses when it comes to animation.  The environments are beautiful and quite vibrant.  Characters designs are extremely consistent but I don&rsquo;t like the designs that Studio Ghibli uses.  Not really a negative, just a personal preference.  Music, really works to create and accent the magical world of Spirited Away.   However, the music is nothing too note worthy, above average I guess.  In contrast, the voice work, this is a meh for me in both the English and Japanese, nothing really outstanding or bad.  However, there really wasn&rsquo;t anything in the movie that would require the VAs to show their talent.  \
As with any Miyazaki films there are themes of environmentalism along with others in particular, greed.  Thankfully, these themes and ideas never become the focus or become too blatant.  Also, I have to add another audience that Spirited Away may have been targeted to.  That would be nostalgic Japanese adults that long for a more traditional setting away from the modern world.  In that respects it does a great job however, I&rsquo;m neither a child nor a Japanese adult disillusioned with the modern world.  So it should be no surprise that I&rsquo;m not very fond of this film, as none of the positives really appeal to me.  Those would be the imaginative/magical or nostalgic world of Spirited Away.\
Spirited Away is an imaginative and magical world that child will most likely enjoy.  In addition, its nostalgic feel will appeal to some Japanese adults.  However, it also features a paper thin plot as well as weak characterization.  Spirited Away is a nice watch if you want to get away for 2 hours and turn off your brain but it is ultimately shallow and forgettable.  Even now after watching it a few hours ago I&rsquo;m having a hard time remembering the details.  \

    The very facet of childhood can be boiled down to the very definition of mysterious wonder and awe-inspiring imagination. We’ve all had those moments where we would go off into our own little world of childlike imagination and try experience an entirely new reality different from our own. Films have tried to recapture the atmosphere that resembles this nostalgic feeling of experiencing the journey of childhood that either succeeded or failed. It just takes a man like Miyazaki to do just that flawlessly.\
Miyazaki isn’t a stranger to making movies about childhood and things similar of its nature; Totoro would be an obvious example to this\
          \
        fact. He certainly has an eye of making these kinds of stories that could be reflected to everyday childhood experiences that we have since grown out of and are now living in a realist way of life. The fantasy elements that are a constant staple to the Miyazaki lore is what has made most of his movies so special to a lot of people, including myself, because of their originality and inventive folklore. Now, that isn’t to say that I’m the biggest Miyazaki fan as much as the next person. However if there is one film that could never lose its imaginative and beautiful vision in his filmography with each passing viewing, Spirited Away would win at no contest.\
In describing what kind of story Spirited Away follows, coming-of-age would be the most logical way of putting it. In that, we follow with our main protagonist Chihiro and how she handles certain situations that would prove to be difficult for any other young person such as herself. When she first encounters this Spirit World she is lost, hopeless, and confused. Not knowing what is going to happen to her or her parents, after they’ve been turned to pigs, she finally finds help with other characters that are willing to help her be acquainted with this world that is unlike her own. Once she is acquainted with the Spirit world, we now see her as a strong individual once she is more aware of her surroundings and is able to take care of herself without the help of Haku. It is by the end of the film the most essential point to what makes not only Chihiro a wonderful character but also how Spirited Away paces its story structure.\
Art and animation are nothing but superb in Studio Ghibli’s legacy in how they incorporate more emphasis on impressionist inspired backgrounds with traditional hand-drawn animation. The scope of Miyazaki’s artistic vision is vast and organic in each of his films that some other Ghibli films sometimes lack in minimal detail. Spirited Away may not have the biggest scope in terms of scale such as his previous films such as Nausicaä or even Princess Mononoke, but I would argue the minimal scope works magnificently with the show’s structure. From the wonderfully drawn buildings to the tiniest detail of rust and wood splinters to the hypnotic waters that surround the spirit world, it complements extremely well with Miyazaki’s ascetic vision and Ghibli’s artistic talents.\
With regards to Art, the one aspect of it that Spirited Away shines the most is its creative art designs of the characters of each spirit you come across. Every single one of them looks absolutely original and not thought of from previous animation, despite most of them obviously inspired by Japanese folklore. It’s not as if most of them are forgettable the minute after you see them. They all stick with you as you go along with the film and even years after you’ll finish it from how memorable and imaginative all of them are from the amazing art designs.\
To describe how the character Chihiro is treated, as in how she is portrayed in the film in her own personality, would come to the conclusion that Miyazaki approached her in a realistic fashion. You’ve often seen kids before that behave like Chihiro, or you may have been like her in her age, and that behavior would be considered “bratty” or “immature.” But these shouldn’t be seen as negatives since realistically that’s what kids are at her age, as you see Chihiro before she goes to the spirit world. We see Chihiro go through hardship when she arrives through the spirit world and then we have this sense of hoping for her to succeed due to bravery and strong courage to help her parents. It gives her a sense of humanity that could make you feel so much empathy for her as not only just some drawing in motion, but as a human being in the flesh in some ways.\
Other characters such as Kamajii, Lin,  Kaonishi, and Yubaba fill in the cast quite nicely. Kamajii and Lin filling in as nice slight comic relief character give Spirited Away a nice needed level of charm from the voice acting and dialogue. Yubaba at first does seem like the villain of the movie but from how you see around it, there really isn’t a villain in this movie. She’s nothing more than just a woman who just wants to run her bathhouse in a very authoritative way that has no ambition to do anything evil in nature. Kaonishi, the spirit that follows Chihiro in the bathhouse, gives the film a vulnerable side to it from his troubles of being alone, all through no dialogue at all, at least from his own voice so to speak.\
Now we come to music. Composed by Joe Hisaishi, who has been Miyazaki’s main collaborated in almost all of his films as composer, it is pure excellence in Hisaishi’s backlog. This shouldn’t really be surprising considering how so well he composes his scores. From listening to his songs on how they interact not only with what is going on currently in the film but also how it leads the story from each scene to another just from how Hisaishi makes the songs so vibrant and adds a whole new way of looking at the films he scores. I guarantee that there is not one person in the world with a clear conscience to listen to “One Summer’s Day” and not burst into tears.\
It is with utmost sincerity that Spirited Away is Hayao Miyazaki’s magnum opus. Though many will claim this to be his most “accessible” film in his filmography, especially the Miyazaki “purists”, it is, for me,  the film with the most heart out of the rest. It’s the type of film that almost hurts to love, in that you feel so vulnerable watching this yet you feel a sense of awe because of how your absolutely mesmerized by how much sublime creativity was put into making Spirited Away. From all of its likeable characters, its brilliant pacing, its memorable score, and great coming of age story, from what little minimal flaws there are to be found in the film, it is all worth while to take in what is grandeur and admire it wholeheartedly. Just as with its atmosphere, nostalgia plays a part in how special Spirited Away is. Not nostalgia in the sense of how you were a kid when you first see it, but from how it invokes nostalgia from the film’s ambiance itself of showcasing childhood curiosity and adventure. Something of which more kids films really need to learn from in future generations.\

    As an Oscar-nominated animated feature by a world renowned director and studio, everyone had high expectations for this movie.\
STORY - I rather liked the basic premise for this movie; it's very simple and reminiscent of a lot of traditional Asian children's stories, not to mention My Neighbor Totoro, with the whole moving away thing. In addition to Chihiro's task of saving her parents, the story very quickly expands to include an assortment of other strange characters, all with their issues and goals, and there are times when we are completely wrapped up in these secondary characters' problems. This makes it almost seem like Spirited Away\

        should have been a short anime series rather than a full-length film. The randomness of some of the side stories really disconnected from the main plot, and I felt like it was a bit too unfocused at times.\
Still, all of the subplots were entertaining, and if you look at the movie as a story of friendship and growth as well, then I suppose they could all be considered relevant. It also adds an element of realism to the film, since it's sometimes difficult to concentrate solely on one matter when there's so much else going on. The scatteredness of everything is also rather typical of Miyazaki's style, so most fans are probably used to it anyway. In the end, it's really just a matter of personal preference in the way of storytelling.\
CHARACTER - I'm not sure how much I actually sympathized with Chihiro. By now, if you've been reading any of my other reviews, you would know that I'm not a big fan of characters with spotless morals, and Chihiro is one of them. She always knows what the right thing to do is, is never greedy, and never does errs on the side of \"darkness,\" even for a little bit. This is especially evident in the No-Face incident. Being primarily a children's movie, I can understand the need for a role model, but I also think it would be easier to relate to Chihiro if she made some mistakes.\
The rest of the cast is a bit better with having varied principles. The ambiguity of Haku's alliance was an interesting element that I enjoyed, though once again, it did irk me that Chihiro seemed unwaivering in her good judgment. Zeniiba and Yu-Baaba were rather generic as characters, but as a huge Alice in Wonderland fan, I did appreciate the references to the Duchess and her gigantic baby. The collection of creatures that came to follow Chihiro around were a little gimmicky, but they weren't very important and were fun to watch, so I guess there really isn't a point in critiquing that too much.\
ARTSTYLE & ARTWORK - I don't think I've ever been a big fan of how people are drawn in Miyazaki's style, but it's bothered me the most in Spirited Away. Chihiro looks like a monkey to me. I can't un-see it! That's just me though, I know. The rest of the art is, as usual, gorgeous. All of the bath house guests, the creatures that appeared now and again, all of the details in the wrinkles and warts of the old women -- they were all great. And not to mention the detail in the environment! Every door and wall and floor and machine looked amazing, and if you paused the movie on a background, you could spend ten minutes just looking for and staring at all the little details that were included. It aways blows me away the kind of time and effort they spend on things that the audience only sees for about five seconds at a time. Just beautiful.\
MUSIC - I wouldn't consider Spirited Away one of Joe Hisaishi's best scores, especially not compared to something like Princess Mononoke. Still, the tracks were always very fitting and appropriate, fun when need be, suspenseful when need be, as should be expected of any soundtrack.\
VOICE ACTING - I've seen both the sub and dub. Stick with the former. Chihiro's English voice just irritated the hell out of me, and while admittedly, her Japanese original isn't all that much better, it's somehow easier to bear. Haku's English voice also could have been much better, and I really wasn't impressed with how most of his lines were delivered. Zeniiba and Yu-Baaba had pretty nice English voices, but I think it's a lot easier to cast for older characters since there isn't as much variation to their voices. The Japanese performance isn't outrageously amazing by any means, but it's at least better than the dub.\
OVERALL - I liked Spirited Away. Though the pacing wasn't that great and some parts dragged on for much longer than they should have, as long as you're watching it with friends, it remains an entertaining film with lots of visual grandeur. And maybe if you emptied your head a bit and tried to think like a kid, you'd enjoy it just a little more, rather than being a grouchy, old critic like me. D;",

    By far my favorite Miyazaki film, Spirited Away transported me to a place that I never wanted to leave. The visuals of this film are simply astounding. The colorful landscapes and the ornate buildings really brought the films story to life. The music was also extremely excellent. The characters were the best part of the film. Each one had their own story to tell. Most people might write this film off as a childrens movie, but in my opinion this is a movie that everyone- adults included- can watch and enjoy. \

    As I'm aging everyday, I felt the need to reminisce about my childhood past, and so recently I decided to re-watch a whole bunch of Disney movies as well as Miyazaki (Studio Ghibili) films. (By the way, did you guys hear that Studio Ghibili is no more? Depressing news for future generations). The movies brought me to tears, and I couldn't help but feel an urge to write a review on how significantly emotional and magnificent Miyazaki's films are. Spirited Away is definitely by far the most popular of all Miyazaki's films considering he won a countless number of awards for the movie and it\
          \
        made more profit than Titanic in Japan at the time. For parents I'd definitely recommend you watch this movie with your children, and children of all ages, if you haven't seen Spirited Away yet in your life, I'd definitely urge you to watch it before you grow too old to enjoy it's purity, because watching it from a child's point of view will leave a tender childhood memory in your life. Watching it from an adult's point of view will make you appreciate the movie (as well as other Miyazaki films) in a whole new light and bring back touching memories.\
The story of Spirited Away doesn't exactly seem all that children-like, because of it's mysterious and somewhat complex plot. It's about a 10-year old girl and her journey into a supernatural world filled with spirits --> witches, ghosts, divine deities, a human-spirit-dragon and more, in order to rescue her parents who have been turned into pigs. Throughout her \"Alice in Wonderland\" - like adventure, she has to find her identity, remember her name, remain her purity/innocence while all the meanwhile remembering what it means to be a human being/a child. Unlike most anime directors or any filmmakers for that matter, Miyazaki doesn't conceal the nightmares/terrors of childhood, which actually yield their own disquieting beauty. He respects the deep silences of his story, as well as its cacophonies. Very young children are apt to be frightened by this film but still enjoy the film if watching with a parent/older figure, proof being myself. But as children grow older and re-watch Spirited Away, they'll come to appreciate it's stunning beauty in story, art and sound. \
What Spirited Away does with it's characters is truly magical. Unlike most anime, Spirited Away successfully portrays it’s characters in a more personal and intimate way. Obviously Anime characters often come off more like set pieces in a story than real, breathing people who control their own lives. But in Spirited Away, for all it’s insanity and typically over the top anime mysticism, the characters are surprisingly quietly intimate. This allows the audience to connect with, sympathize with and actually care to watch for Chichiro. But there are other characters too of some whom are symbolic characters and serve to teach the audience a lesson, of others who are there for kid's enjoyment - comedy, and others who develop into an important piece of the plot; everyone has some kind of important role to look out for. With all these positives said, there wasn't really a character I really loved, but the development of Chichiro really made her a special character.\
Honestly, the story is great and the characters were animated/imaginative, not-realistic creations of truly \"realistic\" beings. But for Miyazaki's films, what can be said more than the animations and in my opinion, the greatest soundtracks in any films ever. Spirited Away's animation was nothing short of masterful; High quality doesn't begin to describe how simply stunning Spirited Away's art is. The setting of Spirited Away has a very traditional Japanese feel to it while mixing in elements of modernity as well. The animations gives the audience a sense of fresh realism in a fantasy world. And the music. Oh my the music. Joe Hisaishi, you are the greatest movie-soundtrack composer ever and without having to say, my personal favorite movie-soundtrack composer. One Summer's Day? Always With You? Sixth Shop? Dragon Boy? Your great music knows no limit. For those of you who have seen Spirited Away know what I'm talking about, and for those of you who don't... Well then go to YouTube and listen to the pieces I just mentioned. The music definitely enhances the emotions felt from each scene, and makes the movie an all the more memorable experience/memory. The voice acting added a sense of realism into characters, especially Chichiro who genuinely sounded like a fightened 10 year old child. The beauty of the sounds in Spirited Away cannot be described in words.\
If you want to purely enjoy this movie and/or haven't seen the movie yet, then I recommend you skip these upcoming paragraph and skip just to the very last paragraph. because I will be analyzing the whole load of themes and symbols in Spirited Away, which is truly a childrens movie, while not actually being purely a childrens movie. There are just so many themes in Spirited Away beyong the surface of a magical masterpiece. \
1. Chichiro aka Sen was stripped of her name. But what does a name really mean though, it's just a 2-couple of words assigned to you at birth right? You can just change it too right? Well, in Spirited Away, the character's names are their quest for freedom. Sen Chichiro must remember the qualities that make her who she is and remain true to them despite her name, the one word that defines her as herself, has changed. In Spirited Away, names are of fundamental importance in the spirit world, and those in power keep their control by stealing and changing names. Only those characters with the inner strength to hold onto their names and identities can free themselves. \
2. What defines a person as good or evil? In Spirited Away, every character morally ambiguous; they're a mix of good and bad qualities and actions.Those who seem good at first, such as Haku and No-Face, have their share of evil qualities, and those who seem bad in the beginning, such as Zeniba, and Lin, show signs of good in Chihiro’s escape to freedom. Chihiro herself is pretty unpleasant at first until later when she reveals her better nature only after she becomes Sen. Spirited Away’s blurred line between good and evil is a much more accurate reflection of the real world outside the film. In the end, evil is not vanquished but pushed aside as characters make choices that weaken bad influences. Sen’s acts of goodness bring out the latent good in those she encounters; just like real life right? \
3. Growing Up, and entering the world of adulthood. What does it mean to be a child? What separates a child from a teen from an adult? The shock of entering the working world is a theme rarely dealt with at this age level, which gives Spirited Away a mark of distinction. At the beginning of the movie, Chichiro is just sitting in the backseat doing nothing while her parents drive, and she just follows other spirits instructions. But as the story progresses, she starts to make decisions for herself and instead of idly doing nothing, she has to enter the working field and work diligently. Though hard work is not the only element of the spirit world that transforms Sen into a stronger, more capable person, it certainly helps her learn to deal with problems maturely.\
4. Human Nature's greed. At the beginning of the film greed is on full display as Chihiro whines and complains to her parents (children's greed for attention) meanwhile, Chihiro’s parents’ greed leads them to eat a whole ton of (unpaid) food that eventually turns them into pigs. Literally every character in Spirited Away is greedy from a small scale to a large scale; Haku being the \"good-guy\" character and all is greedy for power to match Yubabu, the evil witch's power, and Yubabu is so greedy for total control of the spirit realm and gold/gold/gold, eventually leads to the destruction and chaos in the story. She even loses what she covets most as retribution for her greed. In every case, greed makes characters oblivious to what is truly important, preventing them from reaching their full potential as people and spirits. This is a reflection of human society no?\
5. Life and Death. Water represents entrapment and freedom; life and death. Chihiro's realizarion that the previously dry ground is now a huge body of water of which she cannot cross. Reflection that you can't run away from fate- Life and Death. In order to survive in the spirit world, Sen works at the bathhouse, which depends on water for its livelihood. In the course of Sen’s work, she rescues a polluted river spirit by pouring liberal amounts of water over him - life. Sen nearly drowns in the process, but the spirit places her in a protective bubble that keeps her from harm, and this and other acts of kindness play a role in her liberation. But beyond just the use of water, the constant struggle between living and dying - and what it means to be alive (a magical thing) and what it means to be dead (who knows what this means) is on full display.\
This movie is truly wild runs of children's imagination/fantasies all put into one film; I personally believe after watching nearly all of Miyazaki/Studio Ghibili's films, Spirited Away was the single mof innovative and imaginative story by far. Growing up is a beautiful thing, and this movie is a pretty personal movie to me. My entire analysis of all Story, Art, Sound, and Character for Spirited Away can be summed up in entirely one word: \"Beautiful~\" And this movie, as a child, as a teen and now as an adult never ceases to remain as one of the most enjoyable movies ever. \

    At the time of this writing, Spirited Away is ranked #2 among anime movies on this site.  In my opinion, that is sorely inaccurate.  Reading the reviews for it, there are a lot of remarks about the excellent animation and soundtrack (rightfully so) and the strong character design (understandably so), but beyond that, the praise begins to falter.  People struggle to justify the disjointed nature of the film, sometimes going with \"shows remarkable creativity\" and sometimes just falling back on \"makes me nostalgic.\"  Viewers who liked it don't know why they liked it, and that doesn't surprise me.\
In short, Spirited Away\
          \
        feels like a three hour recreation of someone's dream that was carelessly edited down to two hours for the sake of runtime.  For starters, the movie has no true plot.  Chihiro (the protagonist) has lost her parents in a spirit world and needs to get them back and escape.  With that as a distant theme, the movie proceeds to throw characters and situations at us that are only tangentially connected to each other or that goal.\
Are there high points along the way? Absolutely.  The animation far surpasses the usual anime standard.  The musical composition is excellent.  The characters are unique and well-defined.  Everything is vivid and bombastic and well-done...except for an actual STORY.\
I'm afraid the only way to properly explain my issue is with specific examples from the film, so there are spoilers ahead.  You've been warned.\
Let's start with Chihiro's helper and guide, so to speak: Haku.  You begin to get an impression that he's someone like her - someone who got lost in the spirit world but managed to survive by becoming Yubaba's assistant.  He helps Chihiro get on her feet and avoid trouble, and then promptly ceases to be anything more than a plot device.  Haku steals a trinket from Yubaba's sister for a reason that's both not fully explained and ultimately irrelevant.  Yubaba's sister is angry enough to try to kill him, then just forgives him when the trinket is returned.  He promptly loses any interest in taking it again, remembers he's a water spirit (...okay?), and that's the last we hear about him.\
How about No-Face? An interesting character, absolutely, but pointless overall.  Yes, there's a scene where he helps Chihiro, but after that, he eats a bunch of people, spits them out, and becomes a seamstress.  Fun.\
Characters don't so much \"develop\" as they change into completely different people for the sake of the story.  People hate Chihiro...until they don't.  There's a baby that cries and throws fits because he's worried about the germs outside...then he goes outside willingly and becomes a nice person.  The witches are angry one moment and friendly the next.\
And then there are all the little inconsistencies and allowances made for the sake of making the story work (or forgotten when it no longer matters).  For example, there's a big deal made about the importance of names and how losing your name is losing your identity, but it's only relevant for two characters: Chihiro and Haku.  Chihiro forgets her name but then sees it on a card and remembers it again.  Haku makes a big deal about how she needs to hang onto that card so she'll always remember...and then it's never touched on again.  Haku can't remember his original name, and this is treated as significant, but then Chihiro figures it out for him and exactly nothing comes of it.\
Simply put, this is a mess of a movie that nonetheless gets praise because it's presented well.  Perhaps I just don't have the context to really understand it (for example, maybe there are lots of details I didn't catch because I'm not familiar with Japanese culture or mysticism), but from my perspective, as someone who appreciates a good, coherent plot, Spirited Away fell utterly flat.\

    Spirited Away was one of my first anime. I remember my mom came home from the movie store with it one day. It was a pleasant surprise for me to find that such a film exists. After it ended I said to myself, this isn't like any other animated films I had ever seen before . . . and then I watched it a second time.\
Visually, I believe this is Hayao Miyazaki's best film. Everything is a joy to look at. The soundtrack of Spirited Away is one of my favorite anime soundtracks. This is one of the many strengths of the film. I feel\
          \
        that this is the best of Joe Hisaishi's works as well.\
When the soundtrack and visuals come together, it makes all the little things in the film so much more special. The scene where Chihiro is on the train with No Face is one of my favorite scenes in the film. Something this simple can be so great only because of the connection between audio and animation.\
Some people have said the story was confusing. For me, it was not all that hard to follow. Maybe that comes from having seen it so many times.\
Spirited Away is a strange and unique anime that absolutely blew me away. The kind of film you can watch over and over again. It sparked my interest in anime and the works of Hayao Miyazaki. I cannot praise this film enough.\

    Unfortunately, the movie that introduced 'mainstream' America to Miyazaki is not as good as it has been advertised.\
Story: The story itself is rather underwhelming; a small spoiled brat is 'spirited away' to, well, the spirit world, her life as she knows it is suddenly in danger, and she has to overcome her selfishness in order to get back to her world, all the time helping and being helped by an attractive young male spirit who is actually a dragon...did you catch all the cliches in there?\
Art: This is the movie's one saving grace. Miyazaki was always known for his fantastic animation, and Spirited Away is\
          \
        no exception. The scenery is breathtakingly realistic, and despite the two-dimensional characters, could almost be mistaken for live-action if one were to not be careful. \
Sound: The music is relatively bland; no really noticeable or memorable moments in the score. For once I prefer the sound effects to the actual soundtracks. It is also worth noting that the voice actors usually speak all their lines with one monotonous emotion. This is not inherently their fault, though, as will be explained in the next section.\
Character: The movie's weakest point by far. None of the characters are likeable, except the minor ones, and maybe the animals. Sympathy for Chihiro doesn't really grow as the movie progresses, which is no doubt the opposite effect the filmmakers wanted. The spirit Haku is also an offender here; as cool as we are supposed to think he is, this is hindered by his all-around boring-ness.\
Enjoyment/Overall: In the middle of recording this for my family to watch later, I had to just cancel it after realizing how disappointing the film was. What was I expecting? Well, maybe a movie that had a storyline that was taken further, characters that actually develop and manage to be likeable, and an interesting musical score. Is that too much to ask? If you haven't already fallen prey to Miyazaki mania with this one, I would say just skip it. Not missing much.\

    Spirited Away\
Spirited Away is about a 10-year-old girl named Chihiro who with her parents, enters an ominous looking tunnel that leads them to a mysterious town filled with restaurants.\
Chihiro's parents are quick sit down and begin eating. Unable to get through to them that they should leave, Chihiro wanders off and comes across what she recognizes as a bathhouse where a young boy suddenly appears and warns her to leave before nightfall. \
However, as the sun sets, the town begins to fill up with Spirits, and Chihiro returns to find that her parents have undergone a mysterious transformation. \
Now alone Chihiro must fend for herself\
          \
        as she meets strange spirits and creatures, and without her parents she must find a way to save them from being served up for dinner. With help from friends, will Chihiro succeed in her quest to save her parents and leave the mysterious town? Watch the movie and find out. \
My Thoughts:\
Spirited Away is one of Hayao Miyazaki's best works. I so enjoyed this movie. Chihiro grows from a self-centered girl to one of courage and willingness to put others before herself. The graphics in the movie are awesome and the characters are simply superb. Spirited Away may seem at first a child's movie but it isn't, it's a family movie and worth watching.\

    No matter how you approach a review for this movie, this will always be one of the greatest animes ever made. It has fluid artwork and strong characters. And it  eschews from typical anime stereotypes. Most importantly, it has a strong moral point about growing up.\
For some unknown reason, I have heard a lot of criticism about this anime, in that people think that it's no different from anything else that Studio Ghibli has released. Any other anime by Studio Ghibli has not won an 'Academy Award For Best Animation'. Nor has any other Ghibli work been ranked as the best animation title by\
          \
        IMDB. \
Naysayers will cite Western narrow mindedness. I say nay. By now, anime has become such a phenomenon in the West. And more than enough smart people in the West know enough about what makes a good anime. And most of them would agree that Spirited Away has the makings of a good anime and that it is one of the best animes they will ever see.\
Give respect where respect is due. At least give this anime a try. It's a travesty that a piece of art like this is not getting the amount of fame it deserves. You know who to blame (are you listening Naruto fans?).\

    Considered one of the (if not THE) best Anime movies of all time, let's see how good it really is (in my eyes only of course).\
Story:\
The plot of Spirited Away bears a strong similarity to Alice in Wonderland. Both feature young girls stranding in a bizarre fantasy world, struggling to get back home. There are a lot of strange creatures and magic happening. For somebody from the west, some of these things may appear even weirder, but since we are in a fairy tale, that shouldn't bother you. Instead of going forward, this movie takes a couple of turns that may make it hard to\
          \
        follow for the very young viewers, but in general I can say that this is an entertaining ride.\
7/10\
Art:\
I gotta be honest, Ghibli art is not my thing. That doesn't mean it's bad, not at all. Everything works well in the fantasy world, it gives all those creatures unique features and the weirdness that they are supposed to represent. I didn't really get into the humans though. Chihiros facial expressions were really weird at times, not giving the vibe of \"normalness\" that should probably be there to contrast the magical world she is thrown into.\
7/10\
Sound:\
Spirited Away does not feature much of a soundtrack, at least not noticeable. The music felt like it was trying to be on Disney level, but it didn't really work that way. The voice actors did a good job and gave their respective characters a little more depth.\
6/10\
Characters:\
Thankfully the number of important characters is not as big as in, say, Akira. Still it felt like some could have gotten a a little more scenes. Rin for example was an interesting character that had less screentime than I would have liked. But I can't say anything bad about the characters themselves, all feel well designed and fulfill their function. Most are likeable, while Yubaba is a classic evil witch type of character.\
7/10\
Enjoyment:\
I seem to have not enjoyed the movie as much as most other people. That doesn't mean I didn't like it, but it will never make it in my favourite movie collection. Maybe it's because I'm not the target audience and can't relate to Chihiros quest much. It is a good movie, a great movie for children. It's just not my cup of tea in the long run. I did not regret seeing it though, but so many people have praised Spirited Away that I felt nitpicking was more appropriate for this review.\

    Well, usually i avoid reviewing movies because for me it's hard to judge them because i'm more used with series but still, i felt i had to make a review to this piece of art.. \
Let's get to it .. Sen to Chihiro no Makikakushi or spirited away is a movie that came out in 2001 and had a huge success, it had so many that it streamed outside of japan, in many different countries and translated to many different languages.. when i first watched this movie i had 10 years old and i didn´t realize the beauty of it.. now 7 years later i\
          \
        decided to review this movie again, and for my surprise, as soon as i started watching it, I started remembering everything .. what does it means? That in fact, when i watched for the first time, i actually enjoyed a lot for remember it so well 7 years later just by looking at the characters. \
This anime won the oscar price for best animation in 2003, yeah pretty cool hein? \
Story: 9/10. One word to describe it: Magical.. it drags us into that magical world where everything seems so .. magical ! It is fresh and really enjoyable actually. I mean this can be considered a kids movie, and it is but unlike disney movies, where everything seems so childish and ridiculous, here everything looks so nice.. i don´t know why honestly, maybe it is because of the tracks used ..  \
The plot is interesting, creative, original, fluid, and for 120 min, has a nice pace and some twists. Even though being so great, the themes are not that different from the kids movies, which unfortunately makes it look more \"close to clichê\".. when we have such amazing plot and they don´t take advantage of it, it really makes me mad. \
Plus, certain characters in the movie i don´t know why they even appear ! There is a black monster over there that gets 20-30 mins screen time to be totally forgotten.. really felt like he was there to fill in.. and i really hate that ! \
Art: 9/10. It was made in 2001 so it doesn´t look really beautiful to our eyes but still .. the animation is the most fluid animation i've ever seen ! Everything looks so real in terms of movement that it felt like it was being filmed. Plus the detail on the background is stupid amazing. While in some TV shows and even some other movies, they play with shadows, vision camps and gradients to \"save\" some budget by cutting of completely the background (examples: using shadows of black/white they can hide some details, so usually dark places or bright full ones are used to do it; by putting the character in the first plan of vision, they can blur the background that it won´t look bad because we will have our eyes on the character), it's techniques like these ones that manage to save some money... here ... THERE IS NOT ANYTHING LIKE THAT .. every single frame has details so deep as the colours of the pages of the books .. i mean that is just silly. The background is so full of so many things, that forces us to wonder it while the action is happening instead of focusing only the main vision plan .. it's beyond amazing... \
Sound: 10/10 .. please it makes everything look unreal .. and that is the purpose so they made it well.. it fits extremely well with the enviroment, which just creates a nice mood. And this is important actually, like the animation, the sound has the power to \"turn on\" the anime/movie by making it look better from what actually is .. both the animation and the sound have that effect, which is just great! \
Character: 7/10. Well i don´t know if it is because of being movie or whatever, but we only have this characters: Chihiro, her friends and her \"enemies\", if you see the movie you will understand the quotation marks on \"enemies\".. really disapointing.. However our main character saves the day, even though she does not have much development .. it's a movie for god sake ! They don´t have time for deep monologues talking about her personal feelings.. her story is just amazing and can even teach us something .. the rewards of bravery, friendship and nobility. \
Enjoyment: Which such a nice plot, nice animation and nice tracks .. well i full enjoyed every single minute. I got sad when this movie ended .. i wanted more .. and this my friends, is the feeling that tells you if the movie/anime was good or not.. \
The ending was just ... like everything else.. magical. I really can´t tell you more because i want zero spoil, i want you to full appreciate this movie like i did. \
Overall: 9/10 .. it has some flaws so it can´t be a 10/10 .. i would say 9.5/10 so .. you won´t have regrets about spending 5 minutes to give this movie a chance, after 5 minutes into the movie .. sayonara my friends .. i see you in the end of the movie :) \
I reccomend this anime to everyone. It's a piece of art that everyone must try some day .. \

    I've discussed a lot of Studio Ghibli films in the past, and I'll probably touch on more in future. Surprisingly one of their best known films, Spirited Away, hasn't come up yet. It was written and directed by Miyazaki Hayao with production beginning in 2000 and the eventual release in 2001 breaking box office records and winning various awards. Of course, something being popular doesn't necessarily translate to it being good. Although it's a Miyazaki Hayao film so the probability of it being ungood is exceedingly low. Either way, let's take a look.\
Story:\
Our tale opens with a family driving to their new home. The father\
          \
        gets lost and goes down a side street, eventually coming across a worn down tunnel. They arrive at a strange deserted area and find large plates piled with food at an abandoned stall. Our heroine, the young Chihiro, encourages her parents not to eat it because whoever runs the stall is going to get mad at them, but her parents help themselves because she is the only one in the group with common sense. She wanders off and encounters a young boy who tells her that she can't be there and to hurry and get across the river before night falls. She finds it strange but does as she's told. Unfortunately, when she goes looking for her parents all she finds are a couple of massive pigs and by the time she reaches the river it's stretched out far wider than it was before and she has no way to cross it. She finds herself in a strange land full of spirits with no way home. If she wants to avoid getting turned into an animal like her parents then she has to find work. The main conflict centres around Chihiro's struggle to save her parents and return home.\
As rare as it is for me, I have nothing about the story to criticise. The quiet atmospheric scenes are really effective at establishing information about the world, and helping build tension. It's a good thing they didn't do something stupid like throw in narration or chatter because that would have just destroyed the lovely atmosphere. The pacing is spectacular. The narrative itself is highly compelling with a lot of interesting moments. The spirit world is fascinating and the story structure is really good with a very natural progression. I suppose that I could say that the ending is kind of obvious if I wanted to nitpick but in all fairness I can't really fault a children's movie for that especially when everything that builds up to it works so well and the ending itself has a lot of really good aspects and works very well. It may be obvious, but it's still a good ending.\
Characters:\
Chihiro is a really interesting heroine with a good amount of complexity and she does develop quite a bit over the course of the film. It has strong coming of age elements and it handles them spectacularly. The secondary cast also has a lot of complex and interesting characters. Even the little soot ball creatures have some facets to them. I do like that the antagonist isn't some stock villain cliché but is more just kind of greedy and self-centred while having some sympathetic traits as well.\
Art:\
Unsurprisingly, the artwork is spectacular. I've never seen a Studio Ghibli film that didn't look gorgeous. The backgrounds are lovely. The various spirits are really well designed and have interesting looks. I particularly liked No Face and the dragon. The action sequences are really well done.\
Sound:\
The cast is really good. Irino Miyu, yes the same gent who was in hoshi wo ou kodomo, Hiiragi Rumi, and Natsuki Mari are all really good. And Natsuki voices two different characters who deliberately sound kind of similar but she gives them both subtly different qualities that make them sound believably like different people. The music is really good as well.\
Ho-yay:\
No ho-yay in this one either.\
Final Thoughts:\
Spirited Away is certainly a spectacular film. It's easy to see why it made such an impact and has garnered so much praise. The story is amazing, the characters are complex, the artwork is beautiful and the acting and music are both superb. I wouldn't call it better than Nausicca or Grave of the Fireflies but it's certainly a masterpiece in its own right and easily on par with them. As such, my final rating is going to be a 10/10. Tomorrow I'll finish up film festival week with a look at Miyamoto Musashi: Souken ni Haseru Yume.\

    Highest grossing film in Japanese history, winner of an American Academy award in 2002, and it's absolutely amazing.\
At it's heart, Spirited Away is a familiar story. Again, our young heroine learns to find her inner strength and comes of age after “falling down the rabbit hole” and finds herself on a liminal journey through the realm of the spirits. Again it proves Miyazaki’s talent as a director, storyteller, and visionary-- elevating a traditional narrative by just executing it perfectly. \
The lead character, Chihiro, excels as a heroine because her characterization is spot on. Miyazaki wanted to make a protagonist\
          \
        who would be able to speak to ten year old girls-- a demographic which is usually not represented in the medium, since ten year old girls are no longer adorable little children, but have yet to enter what we properly think of as adolescence. It’s really nice to see a strong protagonist young girls can look up to.\
In addition to the coming of age story, Miyazaki also subtly folds in the difficulty of being able to consolidate traditional Japanese spirituality with modernity and the environmental theme pokes its head up again. And rather down the rabbit hole, Chihiro finds herself in a bathhouse for the spirits, allowing for really creative and fantastic visuals (and music; Joe Hisashi here is really at his best).\
It also needs to be lauded for putting Ghibli on the map in the United States. While Totoro, Kiki, and Princess Mononoke had their fans, it was Spirited Away that first received a theatrical release that a fair amount of people saw (albeit after it won the Academy Award). It caught the attention of not only anime fans, but a general audience was suddenly turned onto Miyazaki’s work. It was followed by movies like Howl, but more notably Ponyo and Arrietty which are more obvious examples of Disney’s marketing and releasing Ghibli films stateside; this film set the precedent though.\
This film is the perfect combination of mythical and reality; just the right amount of romance, action, tension, and those scenes where the movie quiets down and just allows us to take in the mood. It's truly a perfect movie, and one that everybody (anime fan or not) can enjoy.\

    Looking at this film, I kept wondering why this film was popular, so I decided to review this myself. When you have looked at my scores, yes, it may be shocking, but my score system works differently from MALs. I'll go straight into the pros and the cons.\
If there's one thing I enjoy about the movie is the character, Chihiro. In the beginning, she portrayed well as typical ten-year old girls. She's irresponsible and slightly rude at times, though she isn't a complete brat. Her character development was handled perfectly and is the strongest point of the movie. She suffered through many hardships as she\
          \
        learned to face the realities ahead of her. One thing that completely came out of nowhere is guessing that the dragon was Haku. This is one flaw that I noticed immediately in this movie when I watched it.\
Unfortunately, this movie isn't perfect. What!? A movie like this have flaws!? Yes. The character Haku is, unfortunately, a weak character. He came to know Chihiro from the past, which was revealed in the end of the movie, but nothing else was developed from it. It was suggested that there is some sort of romantic relationship between him and Chihiro, but the movie just implicated the idea just for no reason. Obviously, it isn't a romance, thank goodness, because if it was, it would indeed bring issues. It's sad that we don't get more interaction between Haku and Chihiro because there bond would have been strong if it did. Remember the last scene where Haku released Chihiro's hand in the end. That scene would have had more impact if there were more interaction.\
The music was handled really well as it did fit with the scenes and it was music that was pleasing to the ears.\
The art is astounding as it did handle detail a lot. If this movie was recreated again, we could all agree that this would be our next scenery porn.\
Overall this movie was good, despite me not enjoying at some parts (though I never apply enjoyment into a rating because it would make it biased.). This movie gets my approval.\
This deserves a (7/10) \"Good\"\

    \"Eat, sleep, and you'll be fine.\" -Lin\
If I've learned anything from film, it's that nothing is ever perfect. But Spirited Away comes really close. There's a reason why it's the only animated movie ever to win the Oscar for Best Picture. It's my favorite movie, in fact.\
I've seen some reviewers complain that there was no plot. Sure, it may not be super complex, but it's no less than Alice in Wonderland, which has a similar premise. There's more to Spirited Away than just a random girl bumbling around a magic world for 2 hours. She has to work to stay alive, taking on difficult tasks\
          \
        like No Face and the River Spirit, while still trying to find her way home with her parents. I will mention that the resolution came rather quickly, however. A similar problem arose with Miyazaki's later work, Ponyo.\
Then there's the art and the soundtrack. I won't go into detail because other reviewers have said the same thing, but the artwork is stupendous, especially for a small team hand-drawing and painting a whole movie in 2001. Joe Hisaishi is a fantastic composer and constructed a whole soundtrack that fits so well with the scenes and the tone.\
People also complain about the characters, I've seen. There's a lot more complexity to the characters than meets the eye.\
-Chihiro-\
Chihiro is, at the beginning, a little girl that clings too much to her parents and is unwilling to try something new. She gets lost in the spirit world, and she grows up a lot. Her experience prepared her for her next adventure, moving to a new town. People criticize her for being too perfect, but she really isn't. She's clumsy and a little wimpy, but she's smart. \
-No Face-\
One of my favorite characters. No Face is a spirit who represents loneliness. No Face desperately wants to repay Chihiro for letting him into the bathhouse and be her friend the only way he knows how. So he gets her attention by any means necessary. And by the end of the movie, he seems so happy to visit Yubaba's sister with Chihiro and then live with her. I especially like No Face because he adds some excitement and humor.\
-Haku-\
Haku is another very interesting character, who ties in with Miyazaki's enviromental theme. Haku is the spirit of the Kohaku river, who flees after the humans fill in his river. Kamaji says that Haku had no home to return to, so he gave up his name to learn magic as Yubaba's apprentice, and was stuck there ever since. Chihiro, as a little girl, lost her shoe in the Kohaku river and eventually frees Haku from Yubaba's control. Haku sees himself in Chihiro, and wants her to work for Kamaji because he trusts him, but is disappointed when she signs a contract with Yubaba instead.\
The other characters, like Lin, Yubaba, Boh, and Kamaji also are interesting but I won't explain them.\
I loved everything about this movie, from it's story to it's humor that's a little better than other Miyazaki films, to it's message about the enviroment that isn't too strong. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.\
Wait, how is Hunter x Hunter higher than Spirited Away on Top Anime?\

    Spirited Away.. The first Hayao Miyazaki movie I watched, even the first anime movie I ever watched. Of course, it is only fitting the first review I would write would be about Spirited Away.\
The first time I saw this movie I liked it immediately; the art is very good, the music is memorable and also the characters make the story great. Hayao Miyazaki creates a beautiful and mysterious world with a deeper layer. This movie makes you wonder about possible symbolism and there are a lot of theories about the true meaning of Spirited Away. If they are officially confirmed or not, this does not\
          \
        really matter - in my opinion only thinking about hidden messages makes a story even better.\
Despite the fact that Spirited Away is not my favorite Hayao Miyazaki movie (I watched several since then), it still has a very special place in my heart since it opened the door to a new world full of Anime for me.\

    This movie was my first introduction to anime that didn't involve teenagers piloting giant robots, and I have to say, if I hadn't seen it, I would've written off all anime as only being fit for 12 year olds.  'Spirited Away' is awesome, beautiful, and one of my favorite movies in any genre.  Some might feel it's only for kids, or long for more gunplay, explosions, heroines with oversize chests and undersized clothes, etc.  Well, that's fine, but they're missing out.  \

    Overview:\
The mopey Chihiro is throwing a small tantrum in her parents` car as they`re on their way to their new home. Understandably for a young child, she hates the idea of leaving her friends and adjusting to a new environment. Little does she know just how different her next environment would be when an ill-conceived shortcut leads the family to a mysterious bath house for the spirits. Her parents transform into pigs, and it`s up to Chihiro to make do on her own while she finds a way to undo the spell.\
Story & Characters\
Spirited Away is a window into Miyazaki`s imagination. Chihiro`s journey takes us\
          \
        at first to the Japanese-lore inspired bathhouse, ruled by (oddly enough) a western looking witch, and eventually to a place reminiscent of a European country side, with walking lamps, bouncing heads, and plenty of other wacky creatures in between. This is far from a trippy, scene-to-scene spectacle though. The story is grounded by and centered around the unlikely perseverance of Chihiro, who seems at first overly dependent, panicky and clumsy.\
Reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland, the fantasy world that appears as if it could not be further from reality actually has numerous parallels to our own lives. There is room to pick each bit of symbolism apart, but the beauty of this film is that such a cerebral understanding isn`t necessary to really get this film. The transition between the awe that the magical world inspires at first to the familiarity we feel for it towards the end is so seamless that it is only after the film is finished that the metaphors for humans and human society become apparent.\
At the end of the day, Spirited Away will very much be a recognizably Miyazaki film with a little environmentalism, and plenty of the sweet innocence of youth. It starts off though, on a bit of a heartbreaking note. Chihiro goes through bouts of despair for losing her parents and as painful as it is to see her sink, it is equally inspiring to see her pick herself up again and continue clumsily at whatever task was occupying her. Unlike most of Miyazaki`s female leads who tend to be beautiful, pretty, or cute (depending on the age group), Chihiro`s chubby cheeks and messy hair make her unmistakably plain. Neither is her personality bouncy as is the case with the vast majority of girls in animation. Other than her listlessness, there isn`t much to describe about her. It is her unremarkable nature that makes her so adorable as the film develops the earnestness in her character that is deeper, and more essential than her personality. Where the earnestness makes her admirable, the plainness makes her genuine, and lovable. We might laugh at her expressions when she touches something vile, or an instance of complete physical ineptitude, but in an affectionate way, not unlike how you might laugh at your niece for tripping over herself.\
Visuals\
Most critics acclaim Miyazaki for the whimsy in his animation, but equally remarkable is the detail that conveys humanity. Chihiro physically expresses herself in more ways than most animated characters. To start, her repertoire of facial expressions is more compete than most, but more importantly, it`s the conscious effort made to put both personality and realism in her movements. One example is when Chihiro must walk down a steep staircase along the side of a tall building. Instead of conveying her terror with a facial expression and ginger steps down the stairs, she gets on her butt and essentially crawls down the steps feet first, treating each rung like a near death experience. It takes some creativity to think up such an extreme, yet human manifestation of fear. The animation shows a layer of humanity that dialogue can`t approach. Regarding the backgrounds and overall visual theme, it is gorgeous and also quite expansive. There are images of luscious greenery, bright and extravagant decor in the bath house, and the serene, pastel-y colors of the countryside.\
Sound\
Piano and string centric pieces go nicely with the downbeat scenes in the film. The antics are accompanied by bright, stop-and-go pieces and the more dramatic scenes get the full orchestral treatment. It works well, but is largely unremarkable. The voice acting is wonderful on both tracks. The English voice actors capture the same essence in the characters as their Japanese counterparts with the exception of Chihiro. Chihiro`s Japanese performance makes her sound older than her age, but fittingly in the dumps, while her English voice is brighter, faster, but more believably childish.\
--\
Spirited Away spans moods, settings and emotions in a way that no other Ghibli film does. More so than even Princess Mononoke, this film is epic. This time, it manages to balance the typical innocence associated with the studio to create something that is intelligent, but also tugs at the heart strings in the most primal way.\

    I'm sorry, with respect to what he's accomplished, Miyazaki can't tell a good story to save his life. As a test, ask someone who loves Spirited Away for a brief wiki-style synopsis and see if they can do it. Probably not, but it's not their fault; it's a plot based on coincidences and contrivances. The sentimentalism is manipulative & manufactured (aww, the old spider guy has developed a grandfatherly attachment to the protagonist for no reason! etc) and the usually great Joe Hisaishi is reduced to sappy Disney style orchestral \"emotional scene #50\" muzak. At a bloated two hours, I don't think good visuals are\

Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi also known as Spirited away, is one of the most famous anime movies, and of course, one of the best. I first saw this movie about 7 years ago when i was younger. And when i saw it, i NEVER wanted to stop watching it. A masterpiece from studio Ghibli.\
Story - 9\
The story is pretty simple as you can read from the synopsis, but very interesting and the plot flaws nicely. Unique story and absolutely not predictable. I believe even if you don't like/enjoy the genres of the movie, i'm sure you're not going to dislike this movie,\
          \
        at least not by it's genres. Funny scenes not in a humiliated way and not too dramatic. And the ending is very nice with no plot holes.\
Art/Animation - 8 \
The animation is nice and it fits the movie. Pretty detailed, and it achieves the mood of the movie. The emotions of the characters are well drawn. Realistic design on both characters and landscapes. Also, there is no CGI.\
Sound - 8\
Awesome voice acting. The soundtracks and the backround music are awesome and everything fits with the movie. Every soundtracks is used in a perfect way. The right soundtrack for the right moment. Note: I've seen this movie mostly with English VAs. Only once with Japanese VAs.\
Character - 9\
The characters are very interesting and almost everyone has a unique characteristic. The villains have their own motivations and they are not there just to exist. The character develpoment on the protagonist is nice. Also, the supportive cast is awesome. Many of them are memorable.\
Enjoyment - 10\
As i said, even if you don't like the genres of this movie, i believe you'lll like it. You'll never get boring while watching it for the first time. I already watched this movie many times, and i'm sure you'll do the same thing. \
Overall - 10\
The younger you watch this movie, the better. That's what i believe. It won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards, the Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival (tied with Bloody Sunday) and is among the top ten in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14. With all that, sit down, and start watching!\

    *Warning! Review contains experiences, not plot summaries, or character analysis! Review will be edited... eventually!*\
Well, shit! Here we are, again! Like I've told once, and a thousand times already, I'm not good at writing a review, with a positive note - it's so much easier for me to go with a negative - but... life's full of try and error, so... here we go, I guess...\
So, Spirited Away, or Henkien Kätkemä, as we call it in Finland, was my very, very first studio Ghibli- movie, that I ever saw... and quite honestly, I really, really hated it! I saw a glimpse, when I was still\
          \
        just a kid, and what I saw, was a parents turning into a pigs, weird, alien-like deities walking around all scary-like, and a story, that was way too much for my little brain to handle, back in the day - plus, I didn't know any english back then, and the finnish dubs and subs were... well, terrible! So, I took the language barrier down, watched it again about ten years later, and absolutely loved it! I loved every single second of it!\
What I expecially love about the japanese movies, is that they don't necessarily explain, or describe every single flipping detail, or exposition out loud, and in your face - you'll have to know just a little bit about the japanese culture and mythos to understand all the the details... to take the actual time to watch, listen and take these little, almost invisible yet subtle hints, that'll tell you even more, than any words could... or absolutely nothing, at all! \
It's like a one of those actually good Silent Hill- games, you know! All the pieces are there, and theres enough exposition to tell you everyhting you need to know, so unless you're totally clueless, and utterly butterbrain brickhead, you'll get the story, but it's ultimately up to you, to put the whole puzzle back together, in order to get the whole experience. Same goes with this movie! There's nothing in the shadows so to say, but very little, if nothing at all, is actually spoken out loud, and explained to you... if you hapen to watch japanese dub, that is! You don't even have to know much about of ann anime, or even like any japanese stuff at all, to enjoy this movie, as an any other movie. The influence from the motherland is still there, but as a premise, this story, could actually take place into anywhere - magic, horror, ancient gods and child-like wonder knows no boundries, and this movie shows us all these things, and more.\
Now sure, I've heard some people actually saying to me in to my face, that they don't like this movie, because of how it ends - they can't seem to handle somewhat open, yet subtle endings, I guess. And, in a way, I can see where they're coming from, even though I cannot fully agree with them. The story may not be that strong, or interesting, if you just skim it through and give it a first-eye glanse, but have some time together with this movie, and atleast try to let yourself be imerged with the characters, and visuals that are both so true, and untrue, that you either wish that you are part of that world - no pun intented - or are just being thankful, that is all just a movie, and no ones parents will turn into a pigs, if they eat food, ment for the gods!\
Overall, this movie is good, It's great. It's... good. I'm actually quite dissapointed, that I cannot find almost any negative aspects out of this, but... it is, like it is, I guess. This movie, is a true masterpiece from Studio Ghiblies golden years... at it's finest, most treasured quality, and if you haven't seen it already, give it a try, and see, was the dream worth the adventure. \

    Yes, I just gave this movie tens across the board. And this is not because of a temporary high after watching the movie. I am not going to wake up tomorrow and say \"wow, that really wasn't that great. Why did I get so excited?\" because I watched this movie many years ago. In fact, this was my first, and to this day remains my favorite anime, movie, and story of all time. \
There are movies that you really have to think about. Movies that you won't understand unless you think about them until your brains come out your ears, and most people, unless totally\
          \
        intrigued, do not wish to think that much. Similarly, there are movies that are so plain in design that they require no thinking whatsoever. They lack in substance and exceed only in the predictable, feel-good story.\
However, I have found that the best movies, and screw movies, just stories in general, are most successful when they find a type of balance between these two polar, but perpendicular ideas. And Spirited Away does.\
Spirited Away has everything we love about predictable movies: relatable characters, character development, unbelievable setting, adventure, and sincere messages. But it also has the quirkiness that people find interesting and the artsy technicalities that experts of this field rave about.\
I can confidently say that when you watch Spirited Away, you are in for a ride. It will be a slightly bizarre experience perhaps, but this balance between the bizarre and the familiarity is exactly what makes Spirited Away a spectacular movie.\
Spirited Away chronicles a girl and her transition from child to young adult. Spirited Away is all about finding inner strength and qualities that you never knew you had, and while the protagonist Chihiro finds herself in the strangest and most frightening world you could imagine, I don't feel that this world is very different from the one she came from. Perhaps enhanced, yes, but the challenges themselves are the same no matter what setting, and Miyazaki shows this in his enhanced atmosphere. Chihiro learns to rely on herself and her mind and her heart, blossoming into a passionate young lady, and while that idea is nothing new, you will be surprised as to how new and important these ideas will seem when you watch the film.\
From my own experience, I can say that Spirited Away effected me particularly strongly. It was not difficult to relate the attitude of the character to my childlike self, and so it seemed to me that her story was similar to my own (although perhaps subtracting the \"spiriting away\" aspect). I cannot know, if I watched it for the first time today, that I would feel as attached to it as I did when I was eleven years old and had never watched an anime before. But I have a feeling that Spirited Away would still have found a special place in my heart. \
I can restate the obvious about the artistic and auditory acclaim of this movie, but I feel it would be redundant to do so when so many have done it before me. If it were up to me, I would talk about the contents of this movie indefinitely, particularly the complexities of Ogino Chihiro, but I feel that that is inadvisable as well, so I'll stop now.\
I hope you give Spirited Away a try and admire the qualities I described above. Happy watching!\

    I feel that Chihiro is a very real person, because it always seems like every character in an Anime I see has a wonderful personality. Well, in terms of character traits, this movie is very realistic and shows aspects of young girls not seen in other Anime/Movies. However, because I am not completely familiar with the Japanese culture, I sometimes felt out of place because some things that would have probably made sense to a Japanese person did not make sense to me.\
Aside from that, the animation was smooth, the music was astounding and greatly contributed to the film, and the character development was just\
          \
        phenomenal. I enjoyed this movie very much and I highly recommend it.\

    Having seen this film a handful of times, I have always been impressed by and admired how technically accomplished it is. Yet after having just watched it again for perhaps the fifth or sixth time, I now feel that the themes and the character development take a back seat to those technical accomplishments. Undoubtedly they are present, but in my opinion one must do some reaching and stretching. As a result of all this, it is hard for me to care about the characters and the story being told. To me, this is one of Studio Ghibli's weaker films. It is an imaginative, well-paced film,\
          \
        though, for aforementioned reasons, I would start elsewhere in the Ghibli filmography. Then again, this could very well be the one Japanese animation that is most accessible for American audiences. Who knows...\

Miyazaki takes Anime and steams it when it should be grilled, yes steaming makes things look tasty, but in the end, it tastes like steam, which is what water tastes like, which isn't usually distinct unless you live in an urban area...\

    When I was young, I used to believe in ghosts, monsters and basically anything paranormal. I'm out of that stage by now, yet part of my childhood still stuck with me. And now I daydream about a fantasy world my past self used to believe in.\
And I have to say, Spirited Away did an amazing job bringing back those memories as a child. This movie probably helped me get into anime as a whole which is quite impressive.\
Let's break it down, shall we?\
Story: 6/10\
This may be the only thing I dislike about this movie. It has holes everywhere. Let's start from the start, with how\
          \
        Chihiro is staring at a boquet of flowers with a farewell card in hand. Many questions popped in my brain:  Who sent those flowers? Who is that person to Chihiro? Why is there no elaboration of that particular character? Later on in the story, we get flashbacks of Chihiro's past. I won't spoil it, but there's nothing much to spoil, really, since there's barely any elaboration. \"Oh I did this and ended up like this.\". We know the reason and the saviour, but what the actual freak were her parents doing in such a life threatening situation? And her mother just retold the story so calmly and nonchalantly that I even wonder if she was the one who threw Chihiro into the God damn river. Moving on, I felt like the ending was too rushed. Chihiro didn't even bat an eyelash or even wave goodbye to the people who actually helped her, like Lin, Kamaji and No Face. No, she gave not a single damn about them. Not a single farewell.\
On the plus side, the story is really unique and easily understood. New anime watchers won't find any difficulty following if they watched this anime first. The story was well woven and the fantasies were great.\
Art: 9/10\
Amazing art. Colours were vibrant, character designs were great, movement was smooth and they nailed every single bit about the monsters. There's really nothing much to say about this.\
Sound: 9/10\
Sound effects were on point, totally nailed that one. The voice of the characters were great. The portrayal of monsters through their voices were pretty on point. The ending song was just gorgeous, soft and smooth.\
Character: 9/10\
It's a great feeling to watch the characters grow from the start of the story to the end. Chihiro's whiny and stubborn attitude, growing to an obedient and courageous girl, then finally ending with an independent and confident character. Kamaji's cold-hearted facade and then a caring and helpful friend at the end. Lin, at first stubborn and mean, then becoming helpful and friendly. Nearing the end she showed her caring side. The big baby's stubborn and arrogant behaviour at first, then becoming self-reliant and caring at the end. Clearly this was well done in the movie. Kudos to the creators for doing this.\
Enjoyment: 8/10\
Well, what can I say? It's great and I enjoyed it. The creativity of the story, the iridescence of the art, the heart wrenching songs and the perfect character development. Honestly a must-watch.\
Overall: 8/10\
And then you grow out of your childhood, memories of your fantasizing young self translucent but never gone, you go on with your every day life. Then one day you sit down and try to recollect memory fragments of your young self, the fantasy you lived and believed in. Spirited Away makes you feel like a child again, and you enjoy it just like a child would.\

    This movie is not named the HIGHEST GROSSING ANIME FILM OF ALL TIME EVEN TODAY for nothing!!! I cannot find the perfect words to describe this movie. But, I will do my best. I just find this movie a masterpiece.\
Let me be honest if Kimi No Na Wa and Spirited Away will both show in theaters at the same time, Spirited Away will win the box office. No offense to Kimi no na wa fans but it's true. The story, atmosphere, visuals, everything is perfect. Almost no goofs and flaws I had seen in the movie.\
It is also a great refresher for today. Watch it\
          \
        with your family and friends it will be a fun ride. Don't name yourself an otaku if you haven't seen this movie.\
Fun fact: NO SCRIPT WERE MADE WHILE MAKING THIS MOVIE. Seriously, how did they do it without a script and still one of the best movies out there.\

    Hayao Miyazaki is a genius and it really shines in this masterpiece. I've watched this movie countless times and it never gets old. It is still just as magical, intriguing and amazing as ever!\
Story: [10]\
The story begins with ten year old Chihiro and her family on their way to their new home and decide to take a short cut. In the beginning, you see little Chihiro as a bratty little girl who is too scared to do anything without her parents. Later in the story you see this character develop beautifully. She becomes a brave, enlightened little girl who looks forward to new adventures. \
Stumbling\
          \
        upon an abandoned theme park, her parents decide to help themselves to a meal laid out in a stand and are turned into pigs by the angry spirits! It is then that Chihiro receives a warning from Haku, a young boy, to leave before the lanterns set but is too late in doing so and ends up stumbling into a sea of water. Forced to work in the spirits bathhouse owned by the wicked Yu-baaba, Chihiro overcomes many challenges and meets new friends along the way. \
Who could Haku be? What does he have to do with her past? How is Chihiro going to save her parents and go home? Will she ever go home? \
A very unique, compelling story!\
Art: [10]\
The art is  breathtaking and absolutely incredible! It gives you a real feel for the characters and setting. \
Sound: [10]\
The voices are crisp and fit the characters right down to a tee. \
Characters: [10]\
Character development and unique personas are present, overall. My favorite characters would have to be Haku, Kamajii and Chihiro. Haku seems like your typical guy, trapped to be Yu-baaba's servant and forced to fulfill her dirty deeds all the while seeming arrogant in public, but gentle towards Chihiro. Kamajii, the boiler man, and Chihiro, the young human girl, surprise you as the story progresses. Lin, No Face, Zeniiba and even Yu-baaba  become delightful characters.\
Overall: [10] \
I give this anime a 10 out of 10. I really enjoyed watching it and actually feeling involved in the characters dilemmas. This is the type of anime that keeps you on the edge of your seat in suspense, but also keeps you craving more in the end. It WILL surprise you. ;] \
This could very well be one of Hayao Miyazaki's best works. To all of you Miyazaki fans out there: cheers! \

    If there's one thing I love about anime, it's Hayao Miyazaki's contribution to it. All of his movies are emotionally-gripping, but this one in particular will always be my favorite and it damn sure deserves all the love and praise it gets!\
One of the first movies in the cinematic anime universe anyone should watch is the beloved Spirited Away. Even the name has a blissful ring to it. It captivates you from the get-go, just as the eerie breeze, \"abandoned\" amusement park, and questionable food captivates little Chihiro's parents in the very beginning. \
Things sure do go bump in the night! As Chihiro begins to\
          \
        disappear, the fun, creepy, goofy, and intimidating spirits appear. That's when she meets the ever-so helpful Haku.\
The mystery, the silent love, the visually-appealing scenes, the hope that Chihiro will remember who she is and make it home again, the... everything. \
It's a fun little rollercoaster from start to finish and you can't help cheering the characters on. Though the ending is bittersweet, I dare you to try not to smile. Have you watched it yet? Your heart is happy, huh? \
I give it a 10. You should, too. Who wouldn't? Let's be honest. Hayao Miyazaki, thank you for this film.\

    Disclaimer : This is the first time I’m writing a review, so I do apologized if there’s any mistake. Also please be kind if there’s any ideas that I put here, badly written or explained. I would also like to say that my English is not perfect, so sorry if there’s any grammar mistakes and what not. I’ve also only seen about 20 anime so far, but I want to write an anime about this because of it’s perfection in my eyes. I will also write this review, in a subjective form of manner, which is seen and written under my point of view.\
There might\
          \
        also be minor spoiler in the review too.\
 Now for the meat of the review.. \
When I first saw the movie, I thought that it would be an ordinary of a girl whisked away in a dark fantasy world, trying to get out from it. Well, that was honestly my intital thought of it, we heard that story many times before both in horror-like setting or a fantasy one in almost every kind of entertainment medium. However , “Spirited away” got some feeling that is something different to me. There isn’t any epic battles, nor dramatic love scenes.. Instead, it’s put in a way of a young girl’s dreamlike-sequence. (Something like what you would dream when you were really young) with a lot of imagination coming into place. Instead of expecting something huge happening like in other anime, I recommend you to just sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy watching this dreamlike-world that have been crafted by the creators because It’s something really special in my eyes (and heart).\
Firstly, the art in the anime, is of course AMAZING! The colours and asthetics feel up the world in like something that a kid would dream off in her imagination. The lights were amazing, the pig looked amazing… everything about the movie was amazing. Honestly, it’s one of the few supernatural  drama-like movie that I will rewatched, seeing I’ve never really like drama-ish type of movies anyway.\
The chracters, oh how I love each and every one of them. In the start, I was thinking that Haku would betray the little girl..I kept on thinking to myself \
“Oh noo… I know where this is heading…Please don’t let it happen like in other medias..” (Judging from other movies and other form of entertainment media).  Then I thought the Yubaba was the antagonist of the movie. I was glad I was wrong.. None of them are the antagonist. It’s really just about each and everyone in the dream-like world trying to live their life. \
In the start, when Chihiro was brought to the sprit world, you can see that she was suffering, scared as she was brought on to a new world where she don’t know anyone.. As we see through her journey of hardship, you can see her going through that hardship as we have this sense of hope that she would suceed ( I mean, who don’t want to see a cute adorable to do so am I right?? ) with her sense of bravery and courage to bring her parents back to human again and return to the human world. It felt really humanly possible, a sense of connection to the world we live in as it fills up with a child-like dream that we would want to explore at any given time.\
In short, This is the type of flim that we can feel vulnerable about, yet feel that sense of awe with the world by how creative and beautiful the world that have been crafted to us. It’s a masterpiece, that I would like to re-watch again after a given time. A trip where I can feel young and human again after a long while in work or university. It’s memorable, it looks beautiful even at the year 2016 (seeing it came out at 2001) It can make you feel like you’re a child again with a huge smile again after watching this movie. It made me smile, and I hope whoever watches this for the first time, will feel so just like me. Enjoy the anime movie guys ! ",

    I have been a huge fan of the Studio Ghibli movies ever since I was very young and watched (My Neighbor Totoro) on television from home. And I have to admit that once again I was not left with disappointment, a strong well-written story about a girl who gets dragged into a different world than the one she already lives in. Where there are spirits of all kinds, Youkai (Type of monsters) who roam through-out this so called land.\
The Art is very Studio Ghibli, it feels a bit odd at first but you quickly get used to it and get immersed into the Movie. The\
          \
        Art is fantastic, that is all I can say, it is very hard to find words to describe it. I would say it is a more realistic yet very Anime (Art Style.) Ugly yet pretty.\
The sound is splendid as always, very good audio quickly letting me get immersed even more. I do not usually think about Audio when I watch anime but every-time I watch a Ghibli movie I always have this thought in the back of my head: (As I watch the Movie) ¨the quality of sound in this Movie is really good!¨ Which is not something you normally would think about. The use of sound is simply incredible, incredible enough for me (who is very dense) to notice such detail in the sound. \
The movie has very strong personalities, it is very good at expression characters feelings, and making you feel with the characters. It is very clear what each character is like and what they have in mind / what intentions they have. So you don´t really get confused. You resonate with everyone and start to grow with the characters the more you watch. At first, i was skeptical of our main little girl, and I was not quite fond of her. But as the movie went on I learned to like her a lot.\
A movie I recommend for everyone looking to have a good time, the movie is both relaxing and exciting and very easy to get into. It has good voice acting both in Japanese and English, though I don´t expect less from Studio Ghibli. An outstanding movie which I would have no problem watching again.\
I would say it is overall a Masterpiece!\
Though there is always room for improvement!\
But that goes for anything in life.",

    First off, this is not a serious review. The story is about a girl who goes into an ancient temple and ends up going to a world full of spirits. She then gets forced to work because apparently thats what you have to do to live. Anyways since I`ve explained the whole story line i`ll get into my little review. Firstly the 3 green heads that has only one dialogue; OY or OI where the stars of the show they made me laugh so much and thats what made me rate this from 3-8. Not to mention the scene where the mouse work-outs and then\
          \
        steals 3 cookies, that scene killed me and made me enjoy it even more. Ok so my conclusion of the story and how she got into the spirited realm is that she was high on meth. and not to mention she fell in love at the age of 10. Anyways I liked it because the green head people and the mouse. The story was ok. Sorry, not sorry.\

    I can't really explain what I feel after watching this movie. I didn't think it was nearly as good as \"Howl's Moving Castle\" or \"The Secret World of Arrietty\". I expected so much since I heard a lot of positive attitudes towards it and since the film had won many awards. But honestly...I kind of wish I hadn't put my money into buying it. I should have tried to find it on Youtube first. I loved the art and music but the story line was just...well, weird. A lot of random moments. I didn't really like the whole idea of Haku and Chihiro.  If\
          \
        I had to pick her to be shipped with anyone it would probably have been No-face, but that's just my opinion if I was forced to pick between the 2 spirits. Chihiro annoyed me with her decisions and how she acted at times, but I guess you can expect that from a child. No-face and \"Granny\" (the twin of the witch) were probably my favorite characters throughout this whole film. They were enjoyable to watch and I liked Granny's personality. No-face was so cute with his shyness and \"ah\" moments.\

    When I first saw this movie I liked it, and I think that was it. Soon I re-watched it and as I grew older I understood more. This anime is not your typical \"Normal girl accidently gets into magic world and meets magic people\". Though it is pretty similair to that it has some special twist to it, that the animators added that really makes the anime stand out from all the rest. \
Myself I am a beginner animator so I think the animation is outstanding. The art is pretty life-like, so I wouldn't really recommend it to people who like the \"very-very-anime-and-not-at-all-life-like\". \
The characters\
          \
        are very different from other animes. I pretty much think the voices are okay, but could be better. I enjoy re-watching it, but it's really amazing as every time you watch it you see it as something new. This story would really show you the Japanese culture. And I think the music is absoulutely amazing and I could pretty much recommend that 8/10 people would go downloading the songs afterwards.\
Overall I would rate this 8 out of 10.\

    When I first saw this movie, I hadn't even heard of anime. I hadn't watched any Japanese movie before, and it was quite a culture shock. Altough it was drawn, it still was a really good story... It felt so condtradictional to the western cartoons, which are seldom for adults too. And when I first contacted the Japanese culture I have to admit I didn't really like it. \
All of that changed after I watched this movie again, a couple of years later. I couldn't believe I didn't like it at first. The characters were so nicely drawn and everything was just so fantastic! The\
          \
        strange story, the japanese-art, just... everything!!!!\
The story is a bit weird. Weird but very good. It is like a fariy-tale, but then... different. It is about a girl who comes to another world and loses her parents. She tries to find them there and get them back. In this world there are all sorts of gods and spirits. She gets a job there and she is making a plan on finding back her parents. In this story there are many side-characters which are really good, and not the whole story-line is about this. But if I would tell you'all the whole story, this review would be very long and spoiling. \
As I said before, the art is great. Altough I have seen a lot of anime nowadays,  I still like the art. The world is so fascinating and full of fantasy. Yeah, even for people who haven't seen anime before (like my Mum LOL) this world is cool. \
The sounds were fine, and altough I'm not really sure, I think I can remember the music was really the right music for this movie. I really enjoyed watching this, and I will recommend this to anyone who wants to see a great movie!\

    Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to be suddenly whisked away into a world completely different from your own? A world wherein a variety of magic and fantasy awaits you around every corner. Well, I haven’t given a single thought about such things ever since I watched the 2002 Studio Ghibli film, “Spirited Away”. It was directed by Hayao Miyazaki (known for his other works, Howl’s Moving Castle & Ponyo).\
When I heard that this was an Academy award-winning film, I couldn’t expect anything less. A lot of people were also raving about how good it was and it has the potential of\
          \
        becoming a classic animated feature. I got curious as to how a movie about a girl being whisked away to a spirit world was really that great. I didn’t know what the big deal was, so it took me several months before I actually got convinced to watch this. I spent that time to read some reviews and watch the trailer. When I’ve finally gotten the gumption to see the movie for myself, it somehow exceeded my expectations.\
The story starts off with a girl on a road trip with her parents. The girl’s name is Chihiro. Upon finding out that they were lost in the middle of nowhere, she and her parents managed to go through a tunnel that unexpectedly lead them towards an uncanny and mysterious place. Unbeknownst to the spirits lurking around the town, her parents ate the food that was set before them without any hesitation. Little did they know that the food turned them into large and meaty pigs. In order to go back to their world, Chihiro must embark on a journey with her newly-found courage and friendships.\
Matched by a lighthearted feel and mood, “Spirited Away” actually has a deep message when you watch the scenes carefully. I couldn’t point out everything because it takes me a very long time before I could take in and digest what the movie really has to offer. Behind all the magnificent and impeccable animation is a message deep enough to touch the hearts of different people. I couldn’t find the words express how much this film touched me in many ways. The beautiful combination of the art, animation, characters, and music morphed into such a wonderful animated feature. One thing that kind of ticked me off was the parents of Chihiro, though. They seemed kind of childish to actually eat something right off the bat without being wary of their surroundings. It’s a very small and minor thing, but still, I can’t ignore the details.\
To sum up everything in a nutshell, I found myself at loss for words. One thing that I would take home from this film would be the fact that sometimes, we get too caught up with things that don’t really matter. In the end, we fall prey to our own fantasies to the point that we start to get blind from reality – the kind of reality wherein we don’t seem to recognize the people or things that are important to us (as shown in the film several times). All I can say is, “Spirited Away” is one of the best animated features I’ve seen.\

    *May contain a few spoilers *\
I am writing this review after I’ve watched Spirited Away for the second time and now I am deeply regretting that I hadn’t watched it earlier, but at the same time, I understand past me. I understand why I  found this movie just “fine” and not amazing.\
If you don’t watch it carefully, Spirited Away may seem simple to you, but you should definitely look for some deeper meanings behind every character and every place. \
First of all, I should say this a perfect Hayazaki movie and it has everything a Hayazaki movie should have and maybe more, if you\
          \
        compare it to the older works of him.  We have infinite imagination, interesting characters and a good romance between two main characters, but if the thing that binds all these together would be bad, which is the plot, then this wouldn’t be such a good movie and I am really amazed how he was able to bind all of these elements together and it’s perfectly done. You can’t see how the story goes and I like this is how it is.  It is like a stand-up show in a more fantastic and somehow realistic way. Ofcourse there is a certain chain of events, but there are also some side-stories that doesn’t really effect the actual story and normally it is really diffucult to blend those side stories to the plot, since I know many movies, books and animes that I had got bored because of those side stories. \
Lastly, the art is wonderful. The sceneries and places are simple, but they are suitable for the story. The most beautiful artwork was the movements of the characters. They were really natural and realistic. I guess this was what makes a fantastic movie realistic most of all, not that it’s a necessary factor, but it’s good to see the effort and the results of this effort. \
So, in conclusion, since I don’t have nothing to say now, I’ll just say I LOVE this movie and also No Face or Kaonashi is the best character of all times. Yes, I’m weird.",

    From the moment I played the movie and watched the introduction, i knew this was going to be a great movie! \
The movie did a really great job making me feel like i was really there. The voice acting was outstanding and the luscious backgrounds added a lot of pleasure. Although very little of the dialogues were a awkward (because, obviously the Japanese communicate their feelings in a different way), you can still have a really fun discussion about the values presented in this movie.\
I recommend this to anyone, even to the person who hates anime. ; )\

I'm gonna be direct with this review. Spirited Away (also known as Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, lit. \"Sen when Chihiro misteriously disappears\") is a masterpiece. I think everybody should watch it, it is not perfect in any way, but it is indeed one of the most enjoyable experiences I ever had.\
This movie made me review my way of reviewing movies (did that made sense) in a way where the plot is not the best in no way but the movie is so enjoyable that it makes up for it.\
[Story&Characters]\
Probably the weakest part of\
          \
        Spirited Away, it starts with pussy Chihiro (fears everything, you can see the plot device from miles away), and her parents that get lost in their new town and find an old theme park. They don't know howevet that the theme park is actually a meeting place for ghosts and other creatures and yadda-yadda-yadda.\
SPOILER ALERT: Chihiro stops being a pussy by the end of the movie. ∑(;°Д°)ᵒᵐᵍᵎᵎᵎ\
The biggest problem about the story is the movie length, Spirited Away looks like it wants to be a series, the movie is full of little stories that add few to no content, and characters that look like the biggest shit end up just being a plot device to make the movie longer (btw, it has 125 minutes. 35 minutes more than a normal movie, about the same length as an anime series episode. COINCIDENCE? I THINK NOT!).\
Obviously, this is not a real problem since these small adventures are indeed enjoyable and the characters are likeable, but it gives you that little empty feeling as the movie relies on a very thin overall plot, enough I could describe its whole 2 hours in less than 5 minutes.\
Which brings us to the other problem: characters. I don't have much to talk about Spirited Away's characters, but for sure they don't add much depth. Not that they aren't likeable, they are! A lot! But their depth goes as long as: This guy has this backstory. this is his motives and he's gonna help you.\
[Art]\
Studio Ghibli doesn't disappoint, no wonder why their works were licensed here by Disney. Every frame is beatiful and detailed, the budget is (literally) infinite. Character designs are well thought, specially the character designs of Yubaba and Kaonashi (No-Face), that mixes likeability and fear perfectly.\
[Sound]\
I haven't found much of the sound, it is nice and fits with the theme. The guy is talented. However, I must give a heads-up to the English Dub VAs and scripter, that actually felt like they wanted to do the shit and put TALENT on it. Hopefully other certain people learn from it.\
[Enjoyment]\
Despite its flaws, Spirited Away is an extremely enjoyable experience, a classic that I (and other people for sure) will enjoy for days.\
[Overall]\
I could just copy my first paragraphs from this review here and it would get the point perfectly. Watch it. Despite its plot flaws, it will be one of the best shit you will EVER WATCH.\

    To put it simply, this is a beautiful movie that will leave you feeling happy and fulfilled. Unlike most animated features, it does not boast any big fight scenes or flashy characters, it's simply a well written story about a girl who finds herself flushed into a mysterious world of spirits. The story flows so easily, the art is gorgeous and whoever picked the voice actors did a bang on job! \
I've heard some people call the movie \"boring\" and \"empty\", but in this age of flashy anime with no heart, this movie is a somewhat of a saving grace. It proves you don't need\
          \
        an over powered villain, a hero that won't stop getting back up, battle sequences etc... You just need a good story! Which is exactly what this is. I found myself so enthralled by the story, art and dialogue! It kept me smiling like a child throughout it's entire duration!\
If you haven't watched \"Spirited Away\", please do! I promise you will enjoy it as long as you keep an open mind and heart.\

Story 8/10 the story seams a lot like Alice in wonderland a regular defenseless girl falls into a another worlds located in a tunnel. but boy, aren't there some chilling moments, Chihiro`s parents getting turned into pigs, Haku almost killed of bloodshed and no-face eating almost everyone. The looming thought of Chihrio never escaping and how in other movies characters have free will, when in this movie our character can`t do much but wait. Sound & Art 6/10 These go hand and hand, i did`t notice any moments where they played any off putting music or played it at the wrong time. and the art is fair, what you would find in a Ghibli film. Overall 10/10 this movie is my favorite Ghibli film and is properly praised. if you are reading this without watching the movie go see it right now it see the magic for yourself.\

    From my childhood, I enjoyed many fairy tails, I still enjoy them to this day. There is a unique charm to these stories that make them so good to lisention. These stories bring out our inner child, they are calm, they are simple are most importantly they tug your heartstrings. These stories do not only appeal to children but also every adult out there. People might like these stories due to nostalgia or any other cause, one thing is simple the audience for these stories is huge.\
As such what is the better way to make a niche medium of entertainment like anime accessible to the\
          \
        world rather than implementing this kind of stories? Nearly, every Ghibli follows and includes at least some part of fairy tail and children stories in their movies, because of this Ghibli had gained many fans outside of anime community and gain recognition as one of the best Anime studios to ever exist and Spirited Away had a huge part in it.\
Pacing in Spirited Away is the strongest point in the film. The movie flows like clam water jeweled with moonlight slowly moving towards its destination, in between you may be passed by a ship or two but it is fine. Spirited Away never breaks its rule of mystical calmness. Pacing of the whole movie follows three stages, first is fast but simple and calm plot dump(not in a bad way), second has a slow and steady pacing giving you warm feeling and binds you in with this fantasy world and its characters and third is again slow but calm climax allowing developed characters shine. It is the best pace system design you can have theoretically. You build a dam, filled with water and then bam, all of those emotions falls upon viewers. Though it is commonly used in many western movies, it is still executed very well. It never felt rushed, slow and calming pacing just absorbs you in this world which many western movies fail to do so.\
The animation is very well done(It is a movie of course). most of the time art style matter that fluidity of animation. Spirited Away doesn’t have Anime touch in its art style, it has more Disney kind of feel which always have been in every Ghibli film. This probably makes movie more kid and western friendly but also loses the charm it could have gotten with Anime style. Well, let’s are honest here it is a children’s movie.\
Spirited Away is not unique by any standards, characters, music, and other elements are mediocre at best and subpar at worst. I will say that “I have seen better than that”.\
Spirited Away is a movie that follows every fundamental of movie making line by line. As such Spirited Away is made to win awards, simply due to sheer discipline in direction, artistic preference, characters, and plot. Everything in this movie tries to be as perfect as possible. While Spirited away doesn’t do anything horrible, but it doesn’t do anything perfect either. These awards love their mediocracy because you can’t criticize it but you can inflate its good qualities. Even I can’t criticize Spirited Away because most of it is mediocre and some of it is masterfully beautiful. As someone once said.-\
“People don’t want something magnificent or great to happen they will be happy with something normal and mediocre because most of the time mediocre is fine.”\

      Spirited Away is one of Miyazaki's best known films, but it's by far his best. It's a solid, beautiful movie that fails to keep my attention past the first hour. To put this review in perspective, this movie was the first Ghibli movie I had watched, and the first time I watched it I loved it. However, revisiting it recently, I can't say that I can look back on it with rose-tinted glasses due to all the very apparent issues I have with it, at least compared to other Ghibli movies.\
  Story is fine, played safely, but it's also nothing too outlandish:\
          \
        a little girl named Chihiro moves to a new city with her parents, she gets lost in an abandoned theme park and whimsical adventure finds her in the form of Haku, the secondary protagonist, who leads her back to her parents whilst encountering (and confronting) various spirits from Japanese folklore. It's essentially a Japanese take on Alice in Wonderland, and similarly, the story is pretty disjointed. But, you don't really watch this particular Ghibli movie for the story. That and it's teeming with commentary on things like greed, pollution and the dissolution of traditional sociological ideologies in exchange for newer ones, particularly concerning post-war Japan. There's many arguments one could make about the symbolism in this movie, because everything is vague enough to pose those questions, which I can appreciate in a film like this. I don't believe that a non-Japanese speaker could truly understand these underlying messages, though, but it's still a very interesting point of discussion.\
  The art in this film is impeccable, and it's probably my favorite Ghibli movie in that aspect. The style is very detailed and distinct, and the animation, particularly towards the end, are stunning. Even watching this for the first time gives you this sense of nostalgia and warmth that Studio Ghibli nails every time, with sprawling, almost Walt Disney-esque sequences that are the absolute pinnacle of traditional animation. It's worth a watch solely for how beautiful the art is. The score is similarly good, but is overshadowed in part by the animation and art.\
  Regardless of whether you're young or old, Spirited Away is an enjoyable movie. Just don't watch it in hopes of seeing a compelling, memorable narrative.\

It's something unforgettable and definitely is one of the best if it isn't the best movie i've seen so far and( i have to admit that I watched a lot of impressive movies).My thanks to the whole Team for drawing each little move and composing such\

    • My grasp on why people consider Spirited Away great.\
Spirited Away is a collection of events where there is never a dull moment, in a world filled with the supernatural. It is filled to the brim with characters with interesting designs accompanied by fairy tale like traits, giving the movie a way to hook the viewers due to them having experienced things of this kind already. Unlike those stories however, while the characters still have plenty of traits blown out of proportions, they aren't either morally good or morally bad, with no cartoon-ish levels of zeal or evil attached to them. Each characters have an\
          \
        established motivation that is their own and establishes them as working in the world, which is rarely expected in a movie targeting really young audiences.\
The movie follows a kid's experience through a world filled with danger at every turn, that forces her to adapt to everything at each passing moment. Her portrayal is realistic and understandable, nailed down from body language, to mentality, to her reaction to the events. This makes her quite relatable, due to the fact that everyone as a kid, has been at least to some extent, just like her. And seeing her react to each passing element that hasn't been part of her life with awe and fear manages to create a compelling character, due to her reactions feeling genuine.\
Seeing a spoiled cowardly child, portrayed as such, strongly from the very start, adapt to a world filled with supernatural beings where she never really has a dull moment where she is completely safe, and then growing into a character that will repay the people that helped her, is something that most people can enjoy. As a result of such, many admire her strong portrayal, as well as her strong development.\
The movie does a good job at presenting how daunting a new world of which you know nothing about can be to an uninitiated child, and also at presenting it with some amazing artistic portrayal, filled with varied designs and a lot of minute details that breath more life into the world. It shows a world that is fascinating, and that can leave you awestruck.\
• What I think of Spirited Away\
Spirited Away is a narrative mess.\
The fact that there is never a dull moment in Spirited Away, does make it entertaining for the first half of the movie, but when it decides to suddenly make its protagonist, from a snotty spoiled brat into someone courageous that suddenly who's only goal is to fix everyone's problems, presented with fearlessness uncharacteristic of the character, I wondered if I'm still watching the same movie, due to there being no moment where the movie takes a moment to explain itself. Due to the fact that the events are so chaotic and there isn't really any overarching plot, Spirited Away pretty much fills like a couple of scenes that weren't really edited in together well. They look stunning, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with them individually, but when you try to follow a narrative thread or see any development in the events, all you find is chaos.\
For the first half of the movie, the movie was ok. The fact that the events were chaotic was fine as it was only a means of showing the protagonist wasn't safe, that the world was rich and to keep the audience engaged by having constant artistic elements introduced, such as various unique character designs. But then, once she settles in, and we get to Act B of the movie, her former flaws, all dissapear, in order for the movie to be able to conclude, with no moment of self reflection or progression towards defining what made her get over herself. What I watched no longer mattered to me simply because I wasn't watching the same character progress through the story. I started with Chihiro, a girl that was too afraid to go in a tunnel and was complaining about her flowers at the beginning of her movie, going right into, Chihiro, this really courageous girl willing to go through dangerous situations to save her family and friends. Where did the courage come out of? Whatever it is, it was never shown in the movie.\
I did enjoy the movie from an artistical sense however, and I agree with everyone that it looks great. And everything in the movie, builds upon this and tries to showcase as much stuff that is visually stunning as possible, to convey emotion. But in order to make a story coherent, you should focus on the events at hand, on the actual story and what influenced things to spring that way. Not to say the characters don't have motivations, but the events really don't tie together in order to tell a story, they simply just happen. Nobody really learns anything, it's just a chaotic collection of events. And the person that should've gone out of the whole story changed doesn't have any explanation on HOW they changed in the movie. They just do. It shows a world that looks fascinating, and that should leave me awestruck, but it falls short of that on me, because it has no narrative hook.\
Due to that the character development holds no value, because there is no ultimate reason for Chihiro's travel from Point A to Point B, and when I finish the movie, due to the fact there wasn't really a strong story, I leave with absolutely nothing. While I wish everything I watched would at least come half as close as to how good the average Ghibli movie looks, that does not really improve the experience I've had with anything I watched by a huge margin. I see movies as means to tell a story, not as a means of an artistic expression. I don't hold it in the same value as a painting, because a movie is not just a painting. It has a lot of other elements. But I do want them to ultimately serve the purpose of delivering a clearcut story. And Spirited Away doesn't really present a story. It presents a collection of stringed together events that don't really have a point.\
Some people will think that I'm just missing the point and that I don't understand the fact that movie is supposed to represent the imaginative mind of a child and represent an adventure that only a child could envision. It does not pursue realism because it just isn't meant to be realistic. That is not what I'm criticizing it for. I'm criticizing it for being lazy and not taking proper time to develop its characters properly, and merely making them do stuff, without regard of representing at least some degree of their inner thoughts, to show how they have changed. That's what they lost me on. Not the thing that most people praise Ghibli for, and are seeking movies from this studio for. But the thing that the people that enjoy Ghibli for simply overlook, and that is the narrative structure. \
And Spirited Away is a narrative mess.\
• Who I would recommend Spirited Away to and who I would tell to avoid the series.\
Spirited Away is a good choice for you if you're looking for a movie that develops an adventure that only a child's mind could conjure up, that is quite strongly represented artistically and that is rich events that are meant to keep you hooked for the entire duration of the movie. I think it would be a bad choice for people that especially value the story, as Spirited Away doesn't really try to tell anything significant or focus on portraying the perspective of the characters they want to develop of what they're experiencing. It is also a bad choice if you don't want a character to suddenly  change personality just to better fit the events the movie wants to show on screen. But note that these shouldn't be too detrimental if you're just gonna experience Spirited Away for its artistic value, as it nails the portrayal of the world it is going for.  Ultimately, if you value aesthetics a lot more than the story, I recommend this movie to you. This is what it will try to keep you engaged with and this is what most people praise it for.\

    Oh man, I love Spirited Away. Hayao Miyazaki's groundbreaking anime phenomenon stills holds up as my favorite animated film in the world right now, cause come on? It's Hayao Miyazaki and he knows how to create engaging worlds. It's such an imaginative and engaging story, that James Cameron's describes both Spirited Away and Osamu Tezuka's Metropolis, both films that are full of \"Beauty, Power, Mystery and above all, Heart\".\
Spirited Away is about Chihiro Ogino, a 10 year old girl who move into a new town with her parents, only to discover that they get lost and later, they found an abandoned amusement park and Chihiro's\
          \
        dad insists them to explore the park. However, a boy name Haku warns Chihiro that this park is forbidden and that she must leave the place before nightfall. Chihiro finds her parents, only to find them transformed into pigs and the entire park gets full of black spirits on nightfall. Now Chihiro works for a creepy old lady, Yubaba, as a servant, changes her name from Chihiro to Sen and if she forgets her real name, she would be trapped in the spirit world forever, Now Chihiro must find a way to save her parents and escape the spirit world, as she learns to accept her life through adulthood on her own. The story is just fantastic and really engaging, as we see a young girl trying to face the toughest situations on her own and believing in herself on what she can do to help the people she loves. Also, there are a lot of touching moments in Spirited Away, my favorite has to be the one where Chihiro sits with a black spirit \"No Face\" in the train station, as the music plays peacefully in the background.\
Spirited Away looks STUNNIG!!!!! The animation made by Studio Ghibli is still the best looking anime, out of all the Miyazaki movies out there (except Mononoke, that's impossible to top). The Japanese culture style of the film really fits into this strange spiritual fantasy film, full of strange but fascinating creatures, spirits and those cute black furballs that appear are also strange but cute. Character designs are very fluid and they really act like actual human beings, like it really brings strong emotions to the character's as they progress through the story on saving Chihiro's parents. Voice acting is fantastic, but the dubbing is perfect, thanks to the wonderful support of Pixar and John Lasseter. Lasseter and Pixar have great respect to the anime industry and to Hayao Miyazaki, cause John loves the works of Studio Ghibli and never make dumb changes to the film so that it's stays true to the work of the director and the English cast that John assembled is fantastic. All the actors voicing the characers were great, including Daveigh Chase, Tara Strong, Jason Mardsen, Suzanne Pleshette, David Ognen Steirs and so on.\
Spirited Away is just a groundbreaking masterpiece by Hayao Miyazaki. If I were you, I would see it again, rather than describing how spectacular the film is and why anime has the balls to bring true originality than most of the garbage Hollywood brings nowadays. Spirited Away is a must-own film for any anime fan out there wanting to experience this great film on their TV's.",

    This show is very beautiful in both its art style and its story. I love Miyazaki’s work and this was one of the very first I watched. The storyline feels as though it is a tale of growing up, facing your fears and learning how to take care of yourself. We start out with a girl sheltered by her parents slightly who doesn’t want to move. She’s grumpy, thinking that no one cares about her own feelings about the move and has some fears about going to a new place. Because of her father’s stupidity (in a sense), they end up at an old abandoned\
          \
        gate in the middle of nowhere and go on in. Turns out this place is a gateway to the spiritual world and the family is swept away into a rather enchanting world where only Chihiro will remember. She is separated from her parents, forced to work in a bathhouse and learn what her own strength is. \
In one of the reviewer’s videos that I watch sometimes, JesuOtaku brought up the idea of the value of ones name. It is shown in many anime like xxxHOLiC and most importantly here. Chihiro’s name is pretty much taken from her and she tries hard to remember it as the story goes on. There is a belief that your name is what makes you and weather you believe it or not, it’s a belief I have. My real name is different then my name online and if anyone knew me in the real world, I am a little different then I am online. It is the thought that people do not know who exactly you are and as Chihiro seems to find out, she is a different person as \
Sen. She is a bathhouse attendant as Sen instead of the child Chihiro. When she becomes Chihiro again, she never really stops being Sen, showing the strength that she gained from her other side. It’s a little heard to understand but I believe that we all have different personalities, though it depends on who we are around. When we are with friends, we are much different then when we are with family. When we are with older people like grandparent age, we are different then when we are with children. If you look at it this way, Sen was someone already within Chihiro. It just needed different people to show that it was there.\
The artwork is astounding and you can really feel the love and attention that was given to this show. Even the detail of Chihiro putting her shoe on is done down to the small taps to make sure it’s on well enough. When people say how beautiful this movie is, they don’t exaggerate. I actually couldn’t find any problems with it in consistencies or loops. It is what it is and its nothing more or less then what you would expect in a well made film. The character designs feel like they are out of a Japanese picture of demons but scaled back slightly for the children as none of the monsters have blood dripping from their fangs or wanting to kill anyone. \
The voices are wonderful except for Chihiro, she just sounds a bit too whiny even when she grows up a little. She yells a lot and it pretty much throws me off when she is supposed to be gentler and thought full. I actually love how Haku sounds pretty young and gentle instead of harsh. Again, all the voices are the dubbed version since I have not seen the sub but they were still exceptional.",

    A mysterious, beautiful epic from Miyazaki.\
The story is, at first, nothing out of the ordinary, for a fantasy. A young girl - Chihiro, along with her parents, gets lost on their way to their new home, and find what they believe to be an abandoned theme park, which turns out to be a fantasy world. When her parents get turned into pigs because of their actions, it's up to Chihiro to find a way in this new bizarre world to change them back, with the help of Haku - a young magician. And I'm not going to say anymore for fear of spoiling this wonderous\
          \
        tale for you.\
But I can bet you will be sitting, at the end, wondering \"Wait, What?\"\
It does leave many parts uncovered and undeveloped, and leaves you wanting and wondering about more. But, in true Miyazaki fashion, you will be daydreaming for the rest of your life of alternate endings, or more developments, or simply more depth into a certain character.\
The music was the main event for me. Look out for the strings/piano combination of 'The Sixth Station', some of the most beautiful music ever composed by the glorious Joe Hisaishi. The beauty of the music almost surpasses the beauty of the film, and that is saying something considering how wonderous the movie is.\
The art is just... splendid. I think the artists themselves drawing and animating this film must have had a lot of fun with it, for it shows in every minute detail. (Look out for the scene in Boh's room or Yubaba's lair, both beautiful in detail and stunning throughout). \
All in all, it's a film I think everyone should watch by their teens. One of the most beautiful, quizzical, mysterious, and will-leave-you-guessing anime films, it's also one of the greatest.\

    An academy award winning film, I thought it wouldn't hurt to try it, so I watched it and find myself stumbling in different emotions moment for moment. Surely it is fun-filled movie that any age would totally enjoy! \
Story (9)\
Given the fact that there are many \"alice-comes-to-wonderland\" series to be found now, this one would totally not fail to stand out above the others. It has its own twist and turns that makes the whole thing interesting. The downfall of the movie for me, is the kinda lame progression of the movie. It is a 2 hour movie, and I kinda felt like some of\
          \
        the scenes are dull.\
Art (10) and Sound (9)\
Matching the great animation of the movie is the well-though out background musics, I enjoyed feeling the movie more with the bgm and sound effects, both categories really gave justice to fantasy side of the series.\
Characters (10)\
Ok the characters made me crazy hahaha, its as if everyone has a bipolar or split personality. It was crazy but I love all of them. The writer totally succeed in making even the antagonists be loved by all the viewers (well at least thats what I felt). And to top that all like all the other fantasy series spirited away had also cute creatures. \
Enjoyment/Overall(10)\
Overall I really enjoyed watching the whole movie. There are dull moments but still, it will totally play with your heart jumping from one emotion to another. I felt an incredible storm in my heart. Indeed. this is one of those movie, you would want to watch over again, every time you find yourself bored and left with nothing to do in that monitor of yours XD\

    First off, this movie was the first anime type thing I have ever been introduced to. I remember my grandmother going to the library and picking out this movie to bring home to me. Being the little outgoing, observant four year old that I was, I was instantly drawn into the movie. In the eyes of a four year old, the story was like being introduced into a whole new world. I had thought I was watching a revolution before my eyes. Now, 11 years later, I must have watched this movie about a hundred times over, literally. In Spirited Away, what I think I\
          \
        enjoy most, is that all the characters are three dimensional, not just Chihiro and Haku. ANd the art was just incredible. When you are watching it on screen, you really feel drawn into it literally. You can smell the smells, taste the tastes, hear the sounds, etc. It is a cinematic masterpiece. Even now, after watching other Miyazaki (sp?) films, I can sense his trend with his amazing movies, but Spirited Away stands out far from the rest. I give it a ten out of ten. This is STILL my favorite movie to date.\

    This film is, yet another Miyazaki masterpiece. I'm giving it a 9 only because there isn't a 9.5. Ok, this film is odd, yet well made with an engaging storyline, beautiful art and good characters. \
The  re-watchability is very low unless you leave it 6 months, it's a great journey while you're on it but afterwards it's kind of forgettable.\
A lot of peoples favourite, but Ghibli has done much better.\
 I loved it because it's a gripping, action-packed ride. But its downfall is that it kind of drags on a bit. The first half or so is one of the best animes ever, but\
          \
        three quarters through, you'll be thinking about Cowboy Bebop.\
In conclusion, Spirited Away is a beautiful, CGI enhance, action-packed journey, but it's rather forgettable, and it drags on, and on, and on. Theres better out there than this.\

    Spirited Away is one of the most perfect animated movies I have ever seen. The least I can say about it is that there was not a single moment during it that my attention wasn't completely focused. \
The plot was fantastic and full-bodied. Each character was given so much personality, even the little soot spiders weren't treated as two-dimensional.\
In a way the whole film felt like a dream, in that it is seamless. It flows, effortlessly, from scene to scene, from emotion to emotion - straight from terror and tragedy to comedy - without the subtle bump that wakes you up, that lets you know\
          \
        that the makers of the movie and the creator of the script had wanted you to be crying but now you really should be laughing. It was so LIFELIKE. \
Sometimes in real life the most grim moments contain honest elements of comedy that do not seem out-of-place. But trying to put that sort of convoluted emotion into a film creates a very thin line that too many have fallen off of.\
There was no part of the film that felt fake, or rushed, or shaky; the intensity of the story line and the determination of the lead character was obvious throughout. More than causing interest, this movie made me FEEL. I was sucked into the drama. I can rarely say that a movie made me laugh and cry without feeling like an idiot, but the caliber of this picture is so high that I don't even feel embarrassed. I laughed. I cried. And I loved it.  And you will too.\
Thank you Miyazaki for this Masterpiece\

    This anime is over a decade old, so I suspect that no one will look here. Please don't remove my review.\
Useless Material (skip to below hyphens):\
I've been deprived of anime for quite some time, so I went and I complained to \"her\" again (reference to old deleted anime review that's an inside joke amongst myself) and she said she's about to watch Spirited Away, to which I replied \"carry on, I like your spirit for anime.\" Here's the verbatim of my grieving: \"I have been deprived of anime for quite some time now.\" I'm over my stage of crossdressing. Now I'm in the stage of\
          \
        thinking I'm funny while no one's laughing. I went and annoyed her with commentary, and I've compiled it into an anime review, without images for your reference. Cue the Wizard of Oz song. What am I, a 77 y/o senile great grandfather?\
---------✂------------------------------------------------------------\
TL;DR at bottom\
This really is the middle of nowhere. A bear with a great sense of smell, a mother who can't fend for herself, and the child nobody heeds. A classic example of wildlife. I am so glad I ate before watching this. Oh, he wasn't a bear. Who actually exclaims \"it's water!\" when going into water? I see that bird in my nightmares. Their stair motor skills are superb. Just saw a hollow from Bleach. And those Digimon grandparents. Now I'm worried about childhood friend competition. The toad-frog-thing just endorsed smoking. I got a jumpscare from wood breaking. Ah, so this is how pyramids are built. Idk... *thicc butt* This is exactly why I don't go into elevators until there's nobody else inside. To Yubaba's room... she also endorses smoking. She's going to be like my first boss when I ask to be hired. \"SHUT UP!\" Add a -sei to the end of the worker name. Good ideas... lots of them I see other anime ripping off from. That's probably an exaggeration. The hollow thing... it's that presence I sense sometimes when I'm being followed. Looks just like that creep that flashed before my eyes when I was brushing my teeth as a child. Whoa, circus clown skills! Oh, I see. It's not a hollow. It's a socially awkward stalker with autism. Shikigami like Rewrite... *She finishes movie before I do.* Wait... You're telling me that all the stops I took so far have added an additional 25 minutes to the movie!? *shows another thicc butt from the hamster transforming thing* Just 5 more minutes... I need to SHUT UP. Ending song was loo loo loo loo lool you wasted 2 hours. I'm kidding. My biological anime needs have been fulfilled!\

Needless to say, everything was a 10. Enjoyment for me was all my jokes for no one but me to laugh at. The thing about the sound is that I heard it before and it gives me flashbacks to someone commenting on that video that his son really loved Studio Ghibli and the music was played at his funeral. Ehh... what should I write to make this a legitimate review? It was good. You see, New York Times (who?) named this the second \"Best Film of the 21st Century So Far\" in 2017. With that said, happy birthday to Woodrow Wilson (who?) and Happy New Year (too early).\

    This might be one of the best feature length animated masterpieces ever conceived and more so, ever executed. To say that this movie is stunning is to great injustice to the sheer wonder and whimsy of its art style, direction and choices. Every frame contains in it a wonder, from the dark, brooding staircase to the boiler room, to the packed bath house floor filled to the brim with mystical creatures, each one of which drawn with atention and skill. The film is visually striking and memorable, despite coming out over a decade ago I can't think of a piece of art more wonderfully and\
          \
        carefully animated. Some scenes, such as the soot sprites eating their candy, the running through the flower maze, the shot of the train moving through the water and the paper men on Haku stick with me now. From sheer visual presentation this film deserves itself a spot among the best of the best.\
It, however, delivers on a heart warming story with a strong cast of characters. Chiro goes on a rather typical coming of age story, developing from a petulant and annoying child to a developed, compassionate and empathetic human being, helping to pull others who are drowning next to her out of the water. Every single member of the cast, even the ones with little screen time, feel memorable, interesting and, for those with more time to develop, deep and dynamic. Nothing in the story of character archetypes is particularly new, but each and every one of them is executed with near perfection, which more than makes up for the relative lack of originality in basic story outlines. \
The music and sound stands as the least memorable aspect of the film, but it only every adds to the film and never feels out of place. Nothing pops out to me about it, but that can also be a good thing, the score being sound and well developed but rarely the focus. The English VO, I should add, is quite stunning and well done, and currently the only version I have watched.\
Over all this piece is a visual masterpiece with only minute flaws with its shot composition and phenomenal art. The story is simple, but executed with perfection and with a strong, likable cast of main and support characters. A strong score supports the whole endeavor to create one of the best animated films of all time.\

    Spirited Away is one for the ages. Trust me, this movie has gotten me more than any other movie, American or foreign movie itself. \
Story: The story I guess you can say is pretty basic. If I explain what it is, I'm afraid it loses the complexity and makes the movie sound childish, so I'll just skip out on that one ~. If you're really set on knowing, read the synopsis, but I'm not going to go into further detail here.\
Art: The art may seem like anything mediocore, but trust me, if you pay attention you'll notice how spectacular it really is. Hayao Miyazaki gave\
          \
        so much thoughts into his characters every movements. Having the DVD: Special Edition, I see that. Every little thing that Chihiro does is so carefully thought out. From putting on her shoes, to running down stairs. Simply amazing. The scenery and bg's are breathtaking as well. Man, oh, man is this film a masterpiece. \
Sound: The sound is relatively amazing. The piano themes that play throughout the movie and the movies score fit so well with the overall product it's ridiculous! I've never in my life seen a movie so structured from Story to art to sound and more! The main theme in Spirited Away literally makes me want to go pick up a piano and learn how to play just so I could know that one song.\
Characters: The characters are so fulfilling. They don't shy away from awesomeness. Every character is so well thought out that you can most often probably compare them to someone you know in real life. Each one has a personality of their own and none of them are copies. It's so refreshing to see a movie so pure.\
Enjoyment: Needless to say, this movies enjoyment was over the top. I'm guessing you can see that with the amount I praised the movie :$... It's fabulous.\
Overall: 9. Why, if I didn't really complain about things? The only reason is because it took me a little harder to figure certain things out, and to me, nothing deserves a 'perfect scoring'. I'm stingy, lol. Anyway, HIGHLY recommend it if you haven't seen the beauty that is, Spirited Away already.\
And all you guys who voted it sub par are clearly wacko's. Just saying that with all the respect in my body.\

    Art = 9\
- The animation is very colorful, it makes you \"feel\" that you are living in a \"real\" fantasy world.\
- The graphic is not as generic as an every day anime you watched on TV, but it's quite beautiful, and it can capture the graphic detail of the environment, let say \"a crack in the stone\", \"a moss in the stone\", etc. all can be watched in a clear detail so that we notice the \"crack\" and the \"stone\", the \"moss\" and the \"stone\".\
- But the character's graphic is rather old fashioned and not like the generic modern anime you watch on TV.\
- That's\
          \
        why in Art department, I don't give a perfect 10, but 9 instead.\
Story = 10\
Character = 9\
- The story is wonderful, Hayao Miyazaki succeeds in sewing a simple story with a simple plot, but can draw the audience's emotion to feel exactly like the story goes.\
- For example, (A Little Bit Spoiler) ......................... Spirited Away wants to show the warmth of a motherly love from one character to several others in Spirited Away, then they show it through Zeniba's compassion through a gift to the other character, or even invite a character to stay and live with her, or encourage another character to help others through a simple errand.\
- Just from one example, we could all understand the message of endearment and makes us want to say \"awww, that is so sweet\".\
- And from start from the end of the story, Spirited Away is filled and full of act that we could make us say different kind of emotions.\
- Not just endearment, but also a story of doing the extra effort for the people you love, and the kind hearted Chihiro that will do a helpful deed even to the one that she barely know close.\
- It is the \"will do anything for love\" and do the helpful deed to others that could move our emotions, not only to say \"awww, that is so sweet\", but also a lot of positive moral value that not only we could learn from it, but also makes us to fall in love with many of the characters, because many of them, both the main and supporting cast have a lot of good natured and kind hearted spirit that we appreciate and love.\
- Even the main antagonist (villain) is also lovable, because the main villain the the typical witch you always watch on TV and movies, fussy, cranky, cunning, but a mother at heart.\
- Even so, you still fall in love with that witch, because that is what a witch should be, fussy, cranky, cunning, it's annoying but endearing at the same time.\
- More on the characters department, I noticed that ALL of the cast, ranging from the main even to the supporting characters, ALL of them have a very significant role, and not just a \"just-passing-by\" characters that we could just forget them, because we can't. Because ALL of them has significant role to built the entire puzzle of the story.\
- Example for my explanation above is the example of the character No Face (A Little Bit Spoiler) ................ No Face is a supporting cast, but without him, Chihiro would never got the bath token to bathe another supporting cast, and therefore could not ever obtain the green ball of medicine to cure another cast in the movie.\
- That's why we can not take it for granted any of the characters. ALL of them make the puzzle to be complete.\
- And that's just making the story department a stronger value, because the story is built through all of the characters significant role, which is not an easy task for the writer and director to do, but causing it a very valuable movie.\
- There are lots of endearment act that we could say \"awww, that is so sweet\".\
- There are lots of another act like with such movement that we could drop our tears.\
- There are lot of kind hearted and good natured gesture that many of the characters shows that makes we to fall in love with many of the characters, and learn the \"moral of the story\".\
- That's why on the story department, the score can reach as high as the perfect 10.\
- However, for the character department, the character Haku seems to cold, stiff, and flat in emotion, which is why, even though the other main and supporting characters are very loveable, the score drops one notch from the perfect 10 into a \"9\".\
Sound = 10\
- The sound is wonderful, it has a lot of soundtracks and themes for many of the scenes and act.\
- Which is why in the sound department, it is filled with rich and a lot of soundtracks.\
- And what's more, the soundtracks are as moving emotionally as the scene it self, which makes you -again- be drawn to the emotion of the scene and act.\
- A perfect 10 for the Sound department.\
Enjoyment = 10\
- The explanation basically the same in Art and Story.\
- But the additional explanation is, the story is so light that you don't have to think seriously for the plot. Just sit down and enjoy the show.\
- Is it enjoyable? Of course, It is about an adventure in a fantasy world, but not just a fantasy world, but a colorful fantasy world, the color is bright and cheerful either, makes you feel that you live in a cheerful, bright and \"happy\" atmosphere world.\
- And you will love the characters as explained before, they are all have traits of kind hearted and good natured, and even the villain is likeable, because the villain has done a good job in portraying her self as this fussy, cranky, and cunning evil witch.\
- All the characters are making a significant role to built the entire puzzle of the story, which makes you want to watch \"what happen next after............\".\
- You will find a lot of moving emotionally act and scene that could make you \"feel\" the emotion of the movie just like the writer and director wants you to feel. Kinda like Disney movies, in this \"emotionally drawn to the movie\" department.\
- After all of my explanations above, therefore this movie is not have a lot of enjoyment, but because it has a LOT of enjoyments to offer, this movie has a lot of replaying value. I even watch it over and over again in my DVD.\
- So, enjoyment = perfect 10.\
So, my conclusion for all of my explanations above, this movie deserve a perfect 10.\

    When I first watched Sprited Away as a child I had no clue of what kind of masterpiece it is. I watched it again and I now consider it as a Classic – this meaning it as a lasting significance. Considering it is often listed amongst the likes of the best movies of all time, most consider this the masterpiece of Miyazaki. Miyazaki has the ability to create works that are both emotionally touching and visually stunning, and this certainly is no exception. \
The plot is about the 10-year-old Chihiro that gets trapped in the land of spirits. A boy named Haku helps her to\
          \
        embark on a journey to return home. The film is filled with scenes of inaction, a scene without any action. In an interview with Roger Ebert, Miyazaki explained the usefulness of the little extra scenes called ‘ma’. These are the scenes of inaction, where a character might glance off into the distance or sit quietly. \
These scenes are a common occurrence in his films. The usefulness of these scenes are, according to Miyazaki; ‘If you just have non-stop action with no breathing space at all,, it is just busyness. But if you take a moment, then the tension building in the film can grow into a wider dimension. If you just have tension at 80 degrees all the time, you just get numb.’\
The animation of this movie is also great because of the small details that Miyazaki paid close attention to. Small additions like the dirt on the bottoms of feet, chopsticks falling over when bumped, or a zipper catching the sunlight to contribute to the overall feel of the film. Outside this the art of the characters and environment is appealing to the eye.\
Also the attention put to details is a useful tool for developing characters. Chihiro is supposed to be a typical ten-year-old, so she behaves as such. When she puts on her shoes, she does so with extra care and taps the toe of each shoe to make sure they fit properly. In another scene, the girl’s parents call for her, but she doesn’t answer until the second time.\
All these things add up to make this movie the master piece it is, and why I regard this movie as a true Classic. I fear that I can write half a novella about all the great points that Miyazaki made in this movie, so I can only say that is a great movie to watch. It is not packed with action or drama, but the message it conveys is no less important. Spirited Away will always have a special place in the history of anime.",

    This movie is such a beautiful adventure story. I loved how at the start Chihiro was very outwardly dependent on her parents and was afraid of many things, even her new home, since she hated that she had to move to a new and scary place, but eventually becomes quite independent and brave! I enjoyed the atmosphere of the spirit bathhouse and every moment Chihiro spent there along with borrowing aid from benevolent spirits who helped Chihiro mature and grow!

    This anime is about a girl (Chihiro) who stumbles upon an abandoned theme park. She eventually finds out that it is not completely abandoned, and that supernatural beings visit it at night. \
I first watched this anime when I was young (7 or 8 maybe) and I loved it. I watched it multiple times. I recently came across it again, watched it again, and fell in love with it all over again.

    This is one of the most beautiful movies that I've ever seen.\
When I first saw the old school japanese theme, I had a low expectation about this movie, boy I was never been so wrong in my life....\
This movies contains so much message inside.It is a beautiful love story, Hayao Miyazaki managed to make a really beautiful story, a rich but simple one that goes beyond our wildest imagination but put together perfectly.\
The art and music was outstanding. So many details in the art, and the animation is really good and realistic considering it was made in 2001. Combined with a great music to match\
          \
        the situation, that ending really nailed it!\
The character development of Chihiro/Sen is great, her voice actress matches the character of Chihiro perfectly in my opinion. Chihiro character development is amazing though, she began as a really crybaby, but slowly developed into a really good character. Not only Chihiro, there are some others with great development too.\
Overall this movie surpassed all my expectation, I really enjoyed this one and I'm not sure to find another animated movie with quality like this, this is probably the best animation movie to date",

    This film is.. urm.. unique! That is the only word to describe this film: unique. It has a very unique story and unique characters. Its special in its own way. The film is very different to anything i have seen before, and is amazing. Its easy to see why the film is so popular because of how it changes all the time, and you have no idea of what to expect next. This is my personal favorite Ghibli film for the following reasons: its very relatable and you can easly understand how the main character, Sen, is feeling. It makes you really think about what\
          \
        other people mean to you and what life would be like without them and its great for families because of the childish humor. I didn't give it 10/10 because (minor spoiler) the ending could have been a little bit better, but im not going to talk about that in case you haven't seen the film! 9/10, great Ghibli movie!!\

    When it comes to Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, there really isn't anything fascinating about it's story, setting or characters in general. A story where a young girl named Chihiro, is lost and winded away into a Spirit world and is searching for a way to return to the normal world. Simple right?\
But that is where Sen to Chihiro excels. The simplicity in which the story is unravelled, differs from others. Yes, we've seen this before but because the story isnt anything to worry too much about; it gives the writers enough effort to put into the rest of the AM. This satisfied the standards\
          \
        of my personal enjoyment, sound quality and art.\
You see, Sen to Chihiro isn't about the story building up, it's about how to put the story together with the smaller things. Categorically, Story and Character perspectives of this AM are given a solid 9/10. This is because the characters didn't seem to flow along with the protagonist and it's as if Chihiro is being confused with what her goal is in the story. As for story-wise, it's a good solid storyline but it's been told before so there isn't much to say about that.\
Let's get into the specifics now shall we:\
Story:9/10\
Sen to Chihiro's story is one of those \"you know the outcome\" stories but the way it was delivered or presented was what separated it from different AM's. Everything went in a single flow but it did have some ups and downs.\
Regardless, entertainment is given.\
Characters:9/10\
This is what kind of dragged me away from the anime at first.\
Characters were creepy as f***. Everything up to Yubaba's appearance was creepy, weird and just plain boring to be blunt.\
It did pick up it's pace at the 30 min mark throughout the movie.\
It ended up leaving me satisfied so I guess it was cool.\
Animation:10/10\
Lovely, simply lovely. Everything in this movie was detailed out, with grassy fields to every spick of dust and wood on each floor giving the sense of reality kicking into this anime. I really mean it, I could get away with telling a kid that this is a non-fiction movie. And I'm not talking about the characters of course. This section truly is deserving a 10/10 out of respect for effort.\
Setting:10/10\
Typical, but I liked it you know. Sometimes the Original is good and it's meant to be that way in this case. a stranded island, leading to spiritual worlds. Nothing to complain about in my opinion.\
Personal enjoyment:10/10\
 I'm gonna be honest here' It took me two days to finish this anime. 1/4 the first, rest of the 3/4 the next day. I mentioned this in the characters section, the characters and vibe was really broken and falling apart even though it's just a beginning but it should have felt fresh and new to me but rather felt dull. I stopped around 20 mins, got something to eat and was like \" forget this movie\". \
One thing with me is that I always will finish what I'm watching. And that determination brought me here to make this review to tell you how amazing it ended off as. Not a masterpiece, but truly something you should watch before dying lol.\
Conclusion: \
This was a really good Movie. I recommend this to everyone 9-10+ years of age. Everything compiled was the key to this movie and it showed the audience what the writers are capable of.\
PS: This is my second review on MAL. Help me out on my first review on Tokyo Ghoul and likewise to this review.\
Hope you guys liked the review and choose whether to watch this or not!\

    This is the third movie I've seen three complete times. Avatar was the first; then The Matrix; and now Spirited Away. I think one of the traits of a favorite work is its ability to enthrall you again and again -- that it's just that good in your eyes. I think one of the traits of a truly superb work, one masterfully made, is its capacity for a better experience with each successive viewing/reading. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings got better with each read (3 times so far), as the older I got I could more fully understand and appreciate his literary and imaginative\
          \
        prowess. Similarly, with this third viewing of Spirited Away, I noticed more details in the art, heard the music more distinctly, saw the character interactions in a clearer light, and ultimately grasped even more of Miyazaki.\
For the work of Hayao Miyazaki is, simply put, beautiful. When I first saw Spirited Away as a child, I was frightened by No-Face and the spirits in their ghost-like forms. My second time last spring, I was quite intrigued by the whole thing and the concept of anime, and shortly thereafter began my journey with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. My third time... I was amazed. Stunned. Practically each and every scene, every shot, was a joy to see. Comparing Spirited Away to the anime I've seen so far, it far surpasses most of them. The characters are much more realistically drawn than, say, those in Re:Zero. The soundtrack, kudos to Joe Hisaishi, was simple, yet aural ambrosia. The opening scene, with the gentle piano of One Summer's Day -- oh, that was gorgeous. The background art is like museum-quality art. I like how Miyazaki fills his works with this sense of wonder, this atmosphere of the supernatural. Not everything you see in Spirited Away is necessary for the overall plot -- Miyazaki may add peculiar creatures, or send a message about the environment and civilization, and such things may not contribute to the story, but they're undeniably part of Miyazaki. Not everything in a narrative has to contribute, unlike what Chekhov's gun says. Chekhov's gun assumes that a story takes into account its being a story and thus a narrative issued to persons in the real world. But a story doesn't have to do that. A story can be thought of as but a window, an excerpt of some being's or beings' lives in a certain universe. If one were to film your life as it is, without editing, would everything seen be necessary?\
Anything created by Miyazaki has this endearing quality to it. Something magical, and pure. The story and characters to make your heart full, your eyes wet, your humanity uplifted. Just as most anime are by very nature entertaining, Miyazaki is by very nature good. (I've only seen 4 of his films so this may be a bold claim, but I proclaim it earnestly.)\
All that being said, Spirited Away isn't a complete 10/10.\
Just kidding. I do give Naruto: Shippuuden and One Piece a 10 for what they represent for the shounen genre and their worldbuilding, but everything considered they're not on that uppermost tier. I do give Hunter x Hunter (2011) a 10 for having almost no flaws. I do give Shingeki no Kyojin a 10 because its animation and soundtrack are just godlike, and also because its animation is of the highest quality -- did I mention the animation?\
But a 10 is the highest rating; only the best of the best truly deserve it. I could take the time to examine all of the various aspects that make up an anime in whatever I watch, and I'll probably have much lower ratings overall. But I don't have much time, so I rate out of gut instincts. To me, a 10 of the anime medium is that work that just can't be rated lower. You just... know. It gets the 10, without a doubt.\
So in my opinion, Spirited Away joins the elite few.\

    An entrancing escape from daily life. This movie follows the life of Chihiro as she moves to a new town with her sulky attitude intact. When the appetite of her parents leads their family to a strange region with huge portions of food on display, her parents succumb to their drooling mouths and absolutely stuff their faces. You know how kids can sometimes just sense when something’s not right? Chihiro gets that feeling in the strange town and decides to wander around by herself, only to discover that her parents have transformed into…pigs! She must travel into the depths of a bath house overrun by\
          \
        strange spirits and magic, where as a human, she is utterly alone and an outcast. She keeps her wits about her as she strives to search for a cure to turn her parents back to normal, but will the mysterious boy Haku play the role of her saviour, or does he have other plans in mind?\
The imagery is absolutely captivating. From the magnificence of the bathhouse to the variety of the various magical creatures there. The character design is so unique and distinct for each of the spirits and the characters seem as though they are a mishmash of creatures from the depth of someone’s wildest imagination. From the indignant yet softie Kamaji who is part old man, part spider human, to the majestic but ruthless Haku, who also happens to be a dragon. Yubaba features as the angry old bird women who is the head of the bath house and the strange faceless spirit that is unnervingly adorable and horrifying at the same time. This movie has an array of unforgettable characters.\
The cascade of events in the movie allow the plot to flow very smoothly! As Chihiro ventures deeper into the world of the bath house, she must overcome great feats such as running across a pipe only barely hanging onto a building and some flimsy stairs leading to a huge drop below. Chihiro as a protagonist has a heart of gold and a will of steel. The perfect combination of traits which slowly, but surely wins over the reluctant members of the bath house. Even Yubaba admires the natural talent she has to offer. In her nervous yet determined way, Chihiro is able to make friends with the soot balls that are mischievous and feed on rainbow coloured star confetti, a radish spirit that is indifferently awesome and Lin, who looks strangely like an older version of herself and takes the role of her mentor. \
This movie is enchanting to the eyes, has a musical score that fits each scene remarkably and has menacing and has soft-centred characters. Of course, there is a much deeper meaning below the surface. It focuses a lot on the downfall that reliance on greed will cause a person. It shows the invaluable nature of sacrifice in bringing a person true happiness. This is focused upon in many ways. The first obvious instance of Chihiro’s parents with the spirit world food, the next instance with Yubaba realising that her child is missing and she didn’t even notice because of her preoccupation with the money she was earning and another instance with the spirit No face, who tries to buy Chihiro’s friendship and the friendship of everyone at the bath house. No face is the literal manifestation of greed in this film as he chases Chihiro around, enticing her, yet her strong determination gets her through every trial thrown at her. There are certainly many! From rescuing her many friends, evading danger and recognising her parents amidst a sea of pigs, she certainly doesn’t have it easy.\
The ultimate message of this movie is that real human connections are the thing that is most precious and valuable in this world, as money and treasures will never pull through for you the way a trusty, yet perhaps begrudging friend may. Chihiro sacrifices all the rewards she obtains for her hardworking nature on her friends without a second thought and that’s what truly wins her the ending that is magical, fulfilling and utterly satisfying. This is an excellent movie which masterfully combines amazing visuals and quirky, yet endearing characters with a deep message that resonates as strongly throughout the film at an extremely enjoyable and appropriate pace.\

    \"Spirited Away\" is one of those films that's so good, you almost just want to go inside the film itself, or even one of those rare films that deserves an actual sequel. Director Hayao Miyazaki takes us into a world of pure imagination with beautiful scenery, wonderful characters, and just pure greatness throughout.\
The story follows a little girl named Chihiro, who turns out to be the average 10 year old girl, unlike most 10 year olds in other movies that always talk like adults and nothing like little kids. She and her parents are moving to a new home when her father accidentally takes a\
          \
        wrong turn and ends up in an abandoned amusement park. After finding a restaurant, her parents end up chowing down nonstop, and eventually turn into actual pigs. This abandoned amusement park actually turns out to be a bathhouse for spirits.\
Chihiro meets a another young boy named Haku, who wants to help her get her parents back to the human world. She must stay in the spirit world for a while, though. She gets a job from the head honcho of the bathhouse named Yubaba, and she eventually matures from the experience and turns from being a spoiled child to a well-mannered young girl. Chihiro experiences adventures with other spirits throughout the movie, including a stink spirit, a spirit with No Face, and a gigantic baby.\
Without giving anything away in this review, I will say that this is a masterpiece. I saw this movie when I was in the 2nd grade and I really enjoyed it as an average moviegoer, since back then I loved almost every movie that I saw when I was little. Now 14 years later, I cannot believe how much I loved the movie even more than what I did before.\
The animation/imagery is beautiful, the characters are so hard not to like whether they're good or bad, you'll be completely into the movie as soon as the first scene starts, and it's just nothing but pure greatness throughout. This is the first Anime to receive the Academy Award Winner for Best Animated Feature, and there's no way that no one else can say that it didn't deserve that honor.\
\"Spirited Away\" will move you throughout and will make you laugh, smile, and even cry. You should see it twice. See it two more times after that. It's one of the best animated films ever made; not just in Anime, but in any animation, period.\

    i have seen lot of otakus here write a review for this epic anime movie so i thought i should say what i felt as well\
story-  \
i have watched this anime so many times. enough times to make me remember the characters dialogs. the story had a very warm feeling from the beginning which is very hard to find some gems like these can be found even today's stories if you look hard enough. i loved the plot from the beginning to the end ... everything was just perfect. of course its being  miyazaki senseis movie and a studio GHIBLI it delivered everything\
          \
        we hope and wished for. the plot had a smooth sailing to the end not too fast or too slow it was just right. i love how miyazaki sensei always gives us a world that we can get lost in and wish to be in. this story was full of history,folk tale, legendary characters from stories that it is full of wonder to the end. not a single dull moment, literary we cant predict what comes next..10/10\
art-\
it was beautiful and very original...the backgrounds look so pure,real,fluent and very detailed.the artists work so hard to show every detail in a effortless way. which i always love. like you know its super kawaii...and you know they worked so hard on it but it doesn't seem like it..\
 i like this type of art in \"Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi\" (so every ghibli art )better than the once that tries too hard to look real( still like it)... in my opinion i think doing that steals something from the anime world of wonder..maybe the excitement it gives off....hmm..i love all type of anime art but i like the once gives off the feeling of unrealistically realistic that anime have.. and the beautiful cute charm anime gives off..10/10\
sound-\
i love it so... much.. the ending theme song still rings in my ears  even after watching it many months ago... background music was superb. went well with every situation.. whether it was sadness,happiness,excitement, fighting,love ... you name it they got it..  every situation was explained through amazingly beautiful melodies that goes through your heart and soothes your soul. the music hits your weak points and make you stronger with love and affection ...this is what i felt while i was listening to it...10/10  \
characters- \
ahaaaa...chihiro.. was so cute.. is just a normal girl of her age who transform herself in to something that we all want to be...through her it shows learning new things and making mistakes is good and part of life and growing up...you have to make your mistakes right take time to do it and move forward without never ever giving up..... and the main guy...aha....he is so handsome .. i love him ..and his name is HAKU ....he is so great....actually every main character and sub characters is very important to the story and plays a huge part...in my opinion there are no sub characters i even hate saying that.. all characters are main characters and they are very important in every anime ......10/10\
enjoyment-\
i love watching this anime and i could watch it over and over like i always do without any single complaint ....everything was perfectly done its one of a kind masterpiece that i will keep on watching until i die .. the emotions and the lesson on \"what is truly valuable and important\" is given in a way that you wont forget no matter ho w hard you try.. the story gave me so much to my life.. 10/10\
it teaches us the right way to think about people how to trust so many lessons given and reminded in beautiful way. IT A EPIC ART IN MOTION ..what are you waiting for go watch it right now... sayounara minna...! catch you later on a another review :3\

    The Anime that got me into Anime...\
This was pretty much the first anime that I ever saw (not counting walking through the living room when the five year old kid my mom used to babysit insisted that we put Pokemon on for her), and I'm glad I let my best buddy talk me into seeing it at an art-house cinema.\
I'd never even heard of Hayao Miyazaki when I saw this, and I had some misgivings when I heard that the Disney Corporation had imported this film (don't get me wrong, I grew up seeing classic Disney movies, but their more recent stuff just leaves me\
          \
        cold somehow). But I went along with it and I'm glad that I did!\
I'll admit, when I first \"met\" Chihiro, I wanted to smack her for being a whiny git (proof of how good Miyazaki is at creating characters we can relate to and identify with, and how effective Daveigh Chase was in bringing that character to life), but by the end of the movie, I was cheering for her, as she grew from being a bit of a sniveling wimp to a confident girl who's sure of herself in whatever world she enters. The art design just blew me away at how lush and evocative it is. The spirits and oddball creatures in the spirit realm are convincingly real and weird, yet somehow they're also very familiar.\

There are four \"main\" characters. \
Chihiro: She is a fun and light character, she is pretty normal i think! easily get scared but who wouldn't be in her situation? She is sweet, kind and you can't help but love her! \
Haku: He is a mystery! and with him there are a few suprises. He is acting hard and tough on the outside but i think he is more soft inside. He is pretty cool and somehow he has like he needs to protect Chihiro\
Yubaba and Lin are side characters actually there are few more but even the side characters are well done and have their own unique personality! \

    I feel like I've rewatched this movie so many times, that I can't even count. Miyazaki's works truly captivate the audience and drive magical stories of wonder into the hearts of many, even adults. If I see this movie being played on television, I can't help but be drawn in, regardless of what place it is in the movie. Spirited Away is quite possibly my favorite anime movies that I've ever seen. Now let's get into why!\
\"Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi\", or \"Spirited Away\", is a mystical story that focuses on a young girl, named Chihiro, as the protagonist. She finds herself spirited away (excuse\
          \
        my use of the title there) to a new and magnificent world of fantasy and majesty, the likes she has never seen. There she must overcome trials, in the form of work at Yubaba’s bathhouse,  while attempting to find her way to escape back into her world.\
Story:\
The story is one that many of us are familiar with: a girl gets whisked away from her world, and she has to come back. In order to do that, she has to overcome hardships and grow as a person first. The story is slow paced and laid back in nature, but still delivers the satisfaction you need as a viewer. One thing that is done particularly well is how the story actually develops. It's as if all the twists and turns in the story are actually happening in real time; there are stops where you believe the story will continue and sudden surprises when you think everything has slowed down. Points in time where you think things will develop in a fashion you can predict may very well be slightly, or even entirely, different then you had pictured. Spirited Away executes the idea of “Circumstances are not always what they seem” beautifully. This puts a nice twist on a story concept that is so familiar, that it is predictable.\
As said earlier, the story is light. It is the type that you enjoy, but not for intense romance, dramatic scenes, or incredible fights. You enjoy it for its simplicity. Moreover, you enjoy it for it's incredibly take on that simplicity. Aspects of different parts of the story are introduced casually and solely when needed, in order to enhance the significance of another particular impact. It may almost seem like a gimmick, having to introduce one piece of information completely unbeknownst before in order to increase impact of another aspect, but it is actually done pretty well. \
Art:\
I think the one thing that any of Miyazaki's films do well are their ridiculously good art and animation. The drawing style is great, and is only brought to an entirely new level by the color palette, lighting, and shadowing. You'll notice that the style is very much atypical to the 'standard anime style'. However, it is not so much so that avid anime viewers will find themselves in an unfamiliar place. I’ve always like the flat tones that are given for color in anime, they are very calming when needed, and very vibrant when needed. The animation is crisp and and smooth. So in terms of animation and art quality, Spirited Away has achieved an outstanding feat of greatness.\
Now that the technical aspect of the art was covered, I can get into the real goodies! The artwork was executed in such a detailed manner; one can't help but appreciate it. There is a mix of beauty and horror in the artwork. It is easy to see the magnificence of this realm, but also fear it. Everything is so different, yet treated so eerily similar. There is such variation in the different creatures and such attention to even the most meager of backgrounds and details. Everything has a feel that makes the viewer truly appreciate it. One of the early scenes, where Chihiro is going down a flight of stairs contains such an aspect. The difference in stairs, railings, and even the placement of the stairs really drive a certain vibe that would be completely lost with simple stairs from a house or building. You'll find many things mixed between wonderful beauty and distilled horror, such as Yubaba's giant baby (the thought of a giant baby sort of freaks me out). The realism of expressions from characters, or realism in movement and actions is really pleasing to the eye. You can truly feel the characters' emotions when their faces are riddled with confusion, or sadness, or anger. There are two scenes that really caught my attention towards the artwork; they aren't really spoilers, but if you despise spoilers of any form then skip ahead to the next portion of the review. The scenes are when Yubaba is using her magic to clean up her disheveled office, and the scene with Yubaba's flames in her surge of rage later in the film. There is such complexity and amazing movement in even the most subtle of ways during those scenes that it is unfathomable how it is even performed. Kudos, animation team, kudos.\
Sound:\
I rarely go deep into sound in my reviews, but then again I rarely review anything other than anime series. That is not the case here though, and apparently that is thanks to Joe Hisaishi, a renowned film composer. The music in the film is exceptional. It really drives the feelings of the wonder that is Spirited Away. I enjoyed the music so much, I actually commented on it mid-viewing. You really take notice of the subtle beauty in the highs and lows of the music. It is probably one of the very few soundtracks that I would include in my iPod's exclusive soundtrack list, and that says something in itself. It's just that good. You may not enjoy it enough to put it in your iPod though, but you will more than likely find it to be a perfect match for the story and art of Spirited Away.\
Character:\
This section, like the others, is where Spirited Away shines. There are so many great characters that I could go on and on in this section for a long, long time (I'll try to keep it brief). There are a large array of characters in the film, and each with their own quirks and niches. That is what makes them enjoyable: the fact that they AREN'T usually typical or predictable. They all have a good and bad side. They are all relatable in a sense. You may not love any one character, but you can't deny believing in them. They truly feel like they have life.\
In the beginning, Chihiro comes off as a typical, young, spoiled brat of a girl. She's not very brave, and she cries a lot. However, given the circumstances, she has to get over herself… and she does. She grows as a character, and as a result, she grows on the viewer. Some say that Spirited Away is a metaphor for the point where a young person transitions into an adult and has to work hard for that future. Whether that is true or not, we can see the difficulty and the overcoming of that difficulty in a relatable manner through Chihiro.\
Haku is the unlikely hero of the story. He is the one that serves Yubaba in an almost fishy fashion, but is also the one that helps Chihiro the most. He is, by no means, a perfectly good person or a knight in shining armor. He has a dark past and has committed his fair share of sins, but he is good at heart and pure in nature. It's as if he is being pulled by the corruption that is Yubaba, and the pureness that is Chihiro.\
Corruption may have been too strong of a word when regarding Yubaba. She is a supporting character, but many would consider her the antagonist of the story as she is the one who hinders Chihiro's ability to leave the most. She is not necessarily evil, but she is strict and sometimes unfair. She has unreasonable rules and feels all should abide by them, but has no qualms with being hypocritical when she tries to defend her baby from all things bad in the world. Like all the other characters, she isn't all bad...but she isn't all good either.\
One thing I didn't really like about Spirited Away's character development was how quickly they entered a state of familiarity with each other and how quickly secondary characters become willing, or even eager, to help Chihiro get back home. Maybe it was implied to have been off screen, and maybe it was implied that a large scale of time passed which lead to such things, but I can't make that call. It may also be possible that all of the other characters in Yubaba's bathhouse subconsciously sympathize with Chihiro's situation, as they had likely been in the same one before.\
Enjoyment and Overall:\
Overall, Spirited Away is a masterpiece that excels in every way. It may not be perfect, but it is definitely amazing in art and sound, and the character/story development is high in quality. No matter how many times I see the movie, I continue to enjoy it and continue to find myself enjoying the impact of the more surprising moments. There is one particular scene, with Haku and Chihiro near the end, that ALWAYS catches me off guard. I forget it every time, and it always catches me by surprise. It is something almost significant, but also incredibly significant. That pretty much sums up the entire movie: it is subtle, yet significant majesty. I feel that this movie, along with many more of Miyazaki's work's, should be a staple film and viewed at least once by anyone who enjoys anime or movies in general. There is always the possibility that you will not enjoy it as much as I, or many others, have. Nonetheless, it is worth viewing. \
The only real reason why I didn't give Spirited Away a 10/10 was because of its light-hearted nature, both story wise and character relationship wise. As I said earlier, the character relationships could have been developed off screen or subconsciously. But in regards to story, I enjoy a more deep and engaging story for my personal preference. That is not to say that Spirited Away's story is lacking or engaging, it just wasn't on par with my personal preferences; I still can appreciate the simplicity of the movie. I have read theories on the possibly deeper implications of certain themes of the movie (in fact, one of them is in a review right here on MyAnimeList). They are very interesting to read, but as they are just theories I cannot include them in my interpretation of the story in the review. Also since the theories aren't my own, I will avoid speaking any more of them, but I recommend reading some if you've seen the movie.\
Final verdict: WATCH THIS MOVIE!",

    There are three kinds of friends in the world: there are the ones who are mere acquaintances –you know who they are but you rarely talk with or about them. There are the good friends –the ones who see daily and talk with often but rarely have a deep conversation with or enjoy together; and then there are the best friends–the ones you cherish and adore. Even after fate separates them from you, the memories of interacting with them are forever etched into your mind and reminiscing about those days evokes a gallimaufry of emotions ranging from the joy of recollection to the pangs of\
          \
        nostalgia. \
I believe that the same logic applies to movies too –first, there are the movies that are unfulfilling and are only remembered nebulously. Next, there are movies that you remember the main themes of and enjoyed watching, but did not affect you much; and finally, there are those movies that affect you on a deeper level –they are the movies that make you scratch your head, are simple but yet enigmatic, that makes them such a delight to watch repeatedly. I am glad to include Spirited Away in the third category. \
On the surface, Spirited Away’s premise seems to betoken yet another rendition of Alice in Wonderland; albeit with an Oriental spin to it. It has all the elements of the latter viz. –a befuddled girl who stumbles upon a fantastic realm, a Witch who calls the shots, a bewildering array of beasts or spirits and a few more.\
More than meets the eye –\
But, as with any Miyazaki film, these similarities are just a patina, for once we delve deeper into the movie we realize that in terms of tone, overarching themes, and interactions between the dramatis personae, Spirited Away is a whole new beast inside. \
What seems to be a children’s movie is replete with meaning –protean and varied interpretations can be arrived at depending on the viewer. The frisson of delight that passes through you when you glean another meaning from the tale or stumble upon another scintilla of evidence that helps to buttress your theories or find the rudiments of an alternative one is what makes the movie such a compelling watch or re-watch in my case.\
Now it is hard to discuss the meaning of the movie in detail without divulging the whole plot or impinging on your own interpretations of the movie but we can safely discuss a few themes to give you a glimpse of what the movie holds for a viewer. You can think of them as the hors d’oeuvre or appetizer that would whet your appetite for the main course.\
These themes in question are the leitmotivs of kindness and greed. Most of Miyazaki’s movies, in my opinion, bespeak a man who is well versed in the Buddhist beliefs –and these manifest here in the form of Karma. Without delving deep into the concept, it can be succinctly stated as “Good actions done by a person in this birth or a previous one beget good fate in that birth or a later birth and vice versa.” \
In the context of this movie, this concept is clearly illustrated by the protagonist and deuterogamist of this story who both exhibit a great deal of magnanimity through the movie even at great personal risk. This nobility of character pays rich dividends later on.\
As for greed, the Buddhist beliefs hold that the cardinal reason for suffering in the world is the fact that people are never truly satisfied. When disaster strikes, people hope that things would get better soon and when one is experiencing a moment of rapture, the hope that the pleasure, however, fugacious may it be, should never end. There is no temperance in humans, only a hunger for more, which has unsavory repercussions for many. Essentially, we are always worried about something or the other and so we never live in the present, satisfied with what we have but we always look away into the future enshrouded in the brume of uncertainty. \
As we strain to see beyond this caliginous atmosphere, we descry a faint light. Is it a firefly? Will it lead us to our dreams? Let us find out! We exclaim and impetuously dash after it. \
However, this firefly is the Ignis Fatuus of desire, a misleading light that does not lead to the elysian fields of beatific bliss but to the morass of woe. The glorious vistas of future that it reveals are chimerical and the mountains of gold it tempts us with are Barmecidal. Nevertheless, ensorcelled by her meretricious charm we slog deeper and deeper into suffering. \
Like the leitmotiv of kindness, this concept plays out repeatedly throughout the movie. The nemeses of avarice and rapacity run rampant and afflict most of the characters. In the end, only the selfless actions of the leading duo stop their rampage. \
Kindness and greed are just two of the many parts that constitute the daedal internal workings of this vehicle of imagination called Spirited Away, but as leitmotivs, they are the linchpins –the ones that serve to hold the entire thing together; moreover, they are the most palpable and perceptible of the themes. \
Once one has noticed these themes in action, one knows that this movie is much more than what meets the eye. This serves as the impetus for beginning a search for other underlying messages and soon one realizes that this is a most profound film masquerading as a children’s movie.\
\
Magic Duo –\
To use our earlier analogy, if a movie is a vehicle of imagination and the storyline and the themes comprise its chassis and internal working respectively, then the characters are the fuel that powers it. Without good characters, a movie no matter how compelling in terms of story or profound thematically cannot stake a claim in the pantheon of the legends. \
Here again, Miyazaki pulls out another rabbit out of his hat and gives us two absolutely unforgettable protagonists and introduces a whole bevy of other characters who also make a strong impression on the mind. \
The two protagonists –Chihiro and Haku –complement each other like the effulgent moon and its cortege of coruscating stars in the inky night sky –the absence of either would greatly diminish the supernal splendor of the scene. The affection and devotion they evince towards each other would warm the cockles of even the most frigid of hearts and leave a warm, fuzzy feeling roiling inside for quite a while.\
However, it is not just the chemistry they share but rather it is the way in which, they mutually help the other to overcome their insecurities, face adversity, extricate them from nigh-insuperable predicaments at great personal risk, and contribute to each other’s character development over the course of the movie that makes them such an endearing duo to watch. \
Although the movie revolves primarily around our main duo, the eclectic clutch of supporting characters is interesting and well developed too. Over the course of the movie, we meet a motley bunch that, inter alia, includes a grotesque witch, a kindly old man with a bushy mustache and black glasses who looks like an elderly version of Doctor Octopus of Spiderman fame, and a non-corporeal entity who is quite besotted with Chihiro. All these characters (and others) add their own distinct charm to the movie and make it eminently enjoyable.\
The icing on the cake – \
A great car is not just one that has a sturdy chassis and a good engine, but it also has some sort of aesthetic appeal to it and is not too noisy. Essentially, good bodywork is needed. In the case of a movie, that role is played by cinematography and acoustics, and Miyazaki pulls off a coup with these two aspects too. \
As for the former, Miyazaki’s fecund imagination, nonpareil directing talent and his studio’s expertise in creating living, breathing worlds that immerse the viewer are evinced by the panoply of fantastical creatures, the crisp animation used to render the characters and their expressions, and the variegated backgrounds presented to us that range from a vast, baroque bathhouse to a quaint cottage in sylvan surroundings. \
While Miyazaki expertly handles the former, the latter he entrusts to the gifted Joe Hisashi. As always, Mr. Hisashi, with inimitable skill, ensnares the strings of our heart with a lineup of mellifluous songs that wonderfully complement the cinematography and greatly accentuate our enjoyment of the movie, because after all, the interplay of cinematography and audio is akin to the Tango dance, whose success rests on the shoulders of both partners.\
A Humdinger of an Apologue! –\
Summing it all up, I aver that Spirited Away is a movie that everyone should watch, for its charming story, calming OST, pleasing artwork and endearing characters offer a much-needed respite from the tedium that pervades our lives. However, beneath its raiment of simplicity lie profound and evocative themes and motifs that might help us to lead a worthwhile life by helping others in times of distress and steadfastly sticking to pursuing our ambitions instead of being waylaid by venality, avarice, and other inimical forces. \
This successful colligation of both aesthetic charm and compelling storyline with deeper meanings and moral messages, in my opinion, make Spirited Away a highly recommended watch. ",

    I had heard absolute praise for this movie for a long time so I finally decided to watch it. It starts of pretty interesting and I actually got a kinda horror vibe from it but it was pretty nice and moving. The movie was enjoyable until they reached the love part of it. Now I watch and read quite a bit of shoujo and other romance stuff and I enjoy it but in this case I did not. The movie had such a nice feel going on but suddenly it felt  like it changed and not for the better. towards the end it also\

        felt kinda rushed and I didn't get that satisfied feeling I get after finishing a show. Other than that the rest was amazing. I enjoyed the progression of the plot and the characters were pretty nice. I think other than the parents (Who were complete idiots) I loved watching the rest of the characters and I kinda wish that there was more about them. they were given a very brief overview of alot of them and it would have been cooler if I could know more and understand.\

    Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, or better known as Spirited Away by many people, can be described by many as a part of their childhood.  I personally have watched this movie twice.  One time when I was 5 and got horrified/scarred for life after watching a great majority of the movie, and the other, right before the time of writing this review for nostalgia's sake.  Also, I didn't really remember too much of it back when I was 5, so I have to watch it again.  Anyway, enough backstory, onto the review.\
Story (8/10): For those who don't know, Spirited away is\
          \
        a story that takes place in the spirit realm where our main protagonist Chihiro and her parents find this said realm, and begin spending some time in it.  After a series of events, Chihiro takes on a job at the bath house, gets her name changed to Sen, and the story goes on from there.  The story can be described as original in every sense of the word.  It gives this really outlandish situation to our main protagonist, that forces her to do things that she never thought she would ever do.  The circumstances surround her with these problems, that give very good character development, which many people love to see.  The story's pacing was fairly good, as no part seemed unnecessary or boring.  (After all, this is a Ghibli film.  They do some good work.)  However, I did find some parts of the movie, incomplete.  There were a few plot points here and there that I felt needed more explanation or time in order to fully understand.  But, since they did have a strained time space, and they did so good on the overall story, that they get a bit of a pass.\
Characters (8/10): The characters were very fun and well done.  Primarily, Chihiro.  As I had mentioned before, Chihiro is thrown into these set of circumstances that make her grow in more ways then one.  She's just such a great character and a had such a good motivation and attitude towards things.  Her growth is very noticeable, and very well done.  With the other main character, Haku, I felt like he needed a bit more.  He was good, there's no doubt about it, helping Chihiro with surviving in this new place.  But, there wasn't enough.  I felt that he needed a bit more development or screen time in order to fully capture who he was.  Still a good character nonetheless.  As for the supporting cast members, we have a very diverse group, ranging from the ever so helpful boiler room spider man, Lin, Yubaba, and the ever so creepy and memory scarring, No face.  (This was the guy that scared the hell out of me when I was 5 for many reasons.)\
Sound and Art (9/10): The sound was fantastic and overall very well orchestrated and written.  Each piece didn't feel generic or out of place, and overall, good to listen to.  And because I watched a dubbed version for this, I feel like I need to mention it a bit.  Dub, as many people feel, doesn't really meet up to par with the original Japanese version in most cases.  Spirited away, however is one of those exceptions.  The english voice actors play very well in their perspective roles.  None of them felt out of place or strange, and played exceptionally well in their roles.  I must give wonderful thanks to Daveigh Chase for doing a fantastic job at voicing Chihiro.  She did a very good job.  As for the art, I would argue that it is standard Ghibli fare.  What I mean by that, is the fact that since Ghibli does an AMAZING job at animating and creating beautiful artwork, Spirited Away is blessed by it and in turn, has astounding scenery and art in return.  And since this movie was made in 2001, it marks an animated masterpiece in its time.\
Overall Enjoyment (9/10):  This is my review of it after seeing it the second time.  After watching it, I felt rather happy.  Yes, Ghibli films have that effect on people, and I am no different.  It didn't bore me, I was rather intrigued by the whole thing, and I enjoyed it throughly.  While yes the story was great, the characters were great, everything about it was great, I feel like there was some small things missing.  There are some points in the movie that I would like to be explained, some characters that I would like to get more screentime, and a bathhouse that I would like to try, but the movie was great without those things.  (Last one's kinda personal.)  I still loved watching this, and the whimsical magical world and apparitions made me feel young again.  Spirited away I feel isn't perfect, but I feel that it's damn well close to be.\
Note:  I like calling characters by their real name, and not by some nickname or shortened version.  Hence the reason why I referred to Chihiro as \"Chihiro\", not \"Sen\" as she's more commonly recognized in the movie.   \

    I remember before I had a myanimelist account, when I was just a kid, 6 or 7 years old, I found a copy of this anime at home and watch it. I absolutely loved it. Today, I'm not surprised Sen to Chihiro (Spirited Away) is one of the top anime on this website. First things first, you will love this anime, no matter how old you are. The story, the settings, everything.. they are all crazy, in a good way. \
Story- 10: The whole anime is awesome! The story is very original; I have never seen another like it. Also, the story doesn't make you\
          \
        frustrated, like how a lot of other animes do. \
Art- 10: The art was suitable for me. There are no problems, and I like how the characters are drawn. They're eyes and body shape really go with their personality. The colors really blended in well with the story as well.\
Sound- ?: I watched Spirited Away in Canton dub, and I'm sure most people watch this in Japanese, so I don't know what score to give for this. Overall, the sounds (pigs, walking, water, fire, music, etc) were great.\
Character- 10: I thought the different character personalities were very interesting. Sen (Chihiro) wasn't stupid, like her parents, but she was very determined to get her parents back. Haku was the most interesting of all. He was very mysterious, and he was unlike the other characters at the bath house. The sorceress of that world was really.. weird. She is really grouchy and harsh, but she cares a lot about her child its creepy. The spirit that \
Enjoyment- 10: I really enjoyed this anime. For me, its something that you can watch over and over again without getting bored. If like creative, crazy, sweet, emotional, and maybe a little funny conflicts in anime, this is the thing for you.\
Overall- 10: Well, from reading this, you might already have an idea of what I will most likely say...\

    Having displaced 'Titanic' as Japan's #1 all-time film, being the subject of near-universal praise by fans and critics alike, AND having received numerous awards including a 2003 Academy Award for 'Best Animated Film' - from that, one would think that 'Spirited Away' had better be good. \
And it is.\
Story:\
Think you're too 'hip' for a story about a 10-year old who gets swept away in a Wonderland-like dimension after her parents get turned into pigs? \
As a cynical teenager now, I would too. Was I ever wrong! But it's difficult to explain the world that Chihiro gets trapped in without sounding like a total nutcase -\
          \
        you just have to experience it on screen. Basically, her parents drag her into this abandoned theme park, where they eat the food meant for the spirits and get turned into pigs. Chihiro then ends up working at a massive bath house while trying to figure out how to get her parents (and herself) safely home. \
There are quite a number of subplots under this umbrella of the 'main plot', but it only serves to illustrate Miyazaki's genius as he is able to effortlessly weave all of these stories today into a seamless story. While the plot may sound like a child could make it up, hidden underneath the surface are Miyazaki's comments on contemporary issues like labour relations and environmental protection in modern Japan.\
Nevertheless, it's best if you don't try and analyze 'Spirited Away' beforehand - take my advice, and just sit back and WATCH.\
Animation:\
As usual, Miyazaki's artwork was beautiful. I love the fluidness of the animation and the subtle traces of realism that Studio Ghibli incorporates into the movie (such as the way Chihiro taps her foot when she's putting on her shoe), as well as the detail that is given to the background (the scene with Yubaba's office is SO DETAILED!! It blows me away). However, don't expect to see any bishounen (Haku exempt). Furthermore, you might be turned off by the character designs in Spirited Away (there is SOMETHING wrong with Chihiro's face - I can never pinpoint it, but I think it has something to do with her overly full face, her smallish eyes, her almost absent nose and huge mouth), but the supporting characters are very well done. \
Sound:\
One word: gorgeous, especially the opening number, 'One Summer's Day' with its piano solo and soft orchestral accompaniment. The sweeping musical score by Jo Hisaishi deserves a 10 from me because every piece, every note, fits with the visuals like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. \
Character:\
Characters who are airheaded, whiny, and helpless IRRITATE me like no end. However, I can still (sort of) sympathize with Chihiro even though she is a whiny brat at the beginning of the movie. I mean, if you were 10, your parents had just gotten turned into PIGS, and to top it off, you were stuck in an alternate dimension with no clear way of getting home, certainly you would also be whiny, afraid, and on the verge of tears. However, I greatly enjoyed her character development as the movie progresses, as she grows from a brat who cares about herself the most to a girl who is caring, thoughtful, and one who learns from her experiences.\
On the other hand, the other characters are just simply hilarious. Miyazaki's spirit dimension is host to a variety of lovable characters including dozens of cute soot critters, to a six-legged boiler man, and a baby who could overtake even the best sumo wrestler :) It's not every anime that you see a small bird flying around with a mouse about twice its size. \
Enjoyment:\
A delightful anime that never ceases to make me smile and giggle for a hour and a half, Spirited Away is a must-see for novices and experienced anime-watchers alike. With beautiful animation coupled with a gorgeous soundtrack, Miyazaki's film has the ability to truly spirit you away. \

    I have never watched an anime movie before.To be honest, I wanted to watch a movie no matter how bad it was for the 2015 Anime Watching Challenge. To start off, I thought what's so great about this. Just the usual girl enters a magical world which takes a turnabout and stuff, but this turned out to be a great experience. The movie is a bit slow without much action and drama and stuff but it's fun. It is a very upbeat movie and man can that Miyazaki direct. He's awesome and this is one of his best work to date. This movie makes everyone\
          \
        more optimistic, if that's the right word. The characters are fun and I really love the animation(They won  the gold there). This is more of a family entertainment movie and it would be fun to watch it with everyone. Overall even though it was my first anime movie I know it will remain the best for a very long time. Kudos and don't miss the fun.\

    Okay, I don’t even know where to start with this work of art. “Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi” - or in English referred to, “Spirited Away”, honestly swept me off of my feet. Before I go on though, I’d like to address one thing. This is in fact my review, and my opinion towards this anime. I’m only speaking for myself as everyone has their own thoughts. None are “better” or “more legitimate” than others. \
Starting this off, I’m not going to lie, I saw this anime movie feature when it first came out. I was a child back then, and this film managed to\
          \
        scare me. However, recently I decided to revisit this due to high recommendation of a friend. Never would I have ever guessed that this film would rank so high on my list. Being a child that was easily frightened, the unique animation had sent chills down my spine… but with age, I’ve came to enjoy the plot and characters within this series. \
First, let’s go over the basic plot of this anime. It might seem stereotypical, but this anime introduces the idea of a young girl stumbling into a magical and unheard of world. However, despite previous adaptations of this simplistic idea, Studio Ghibli brought something fresh and interesting to the table. We’re brought into a world featuring a bathhouse for spirits, complex characters, and blooming romance. For those who don’t find amusement in the romance genre, don’t fret. It’s not a major thing in the plot considering that the main character is ten, whoever, it does introduce the power of ‘true love’. With that essential power at their disposal, our protagonist learns how to work with this world to save her parents and to escape in the meanwhile. \
Next- let’s jump into the characters. The first thing I’d like to announce is that the characters are in no way bland. Each person has their own personality, appearance, and importance in this. Character reliability is also put into play here. Our main character, Chihiro, is at first terrified by this whole experience. However, with the help of Haku (a strange boy who aids her in her search to go back home), she’s introduced into the basic lore of this world. Along the way she meets a series of foes and friends who she later learns to get along with. They bond, and over a period of time she becomes content with these spirits. The characters all play important parts in Chihiro’s journey even if it’s a faceless spirit, a huge baby, or a dancing light post. I don’t know if it was only me, but I loved being introduced into the different types of characters in Spirited Away. \
Okay, now onto the more technical parts of this anime ; the anime and sound qualities. The animation is pretty good, as it’s not that straining to watch. I don’t have much to compare it to, but definitely it gets the job done beautifully. The sound quality was good, as they gave distinguished noises to multiple things. \
Now to wrap this up. I highly enjoyed this feature. Hands down, I recommend this to both anime fans and not. It’s a good movie, and it DEFINITELY deserves the high rating it has on MAL . Even though it might not be for everyone, a bigger half of anime fans mark this film as one of their favorites. And after watching this, I can definitely understand why. \

    still peerless with its beauty and production value with a rapturous and timeless score to boot, my nth rewatch was still weighed down with Miyazaki's unfortunately-grating meandering scriptwriting, and the characters' convoluted and/or complete lack of motivations; the film never feels like it moves forward, deigning to pirouette in place to flaunt its pretty colors instead.\
still, the mysterious element of the spirit realm and the masterful world-building is very engaging, and i found the film much, much better than i remembered it.\
on a sidenote, this film also scared me away from anime as a child for more than a decade, so there's probably some hidden\

        malice driving my critical view of its merits.\

    Loved it!\
Chihiro and Haku(Kohaku) is so cute! I totally ship them!\
This had an \"adventure\" feel to it. I love it!\
Their little romance is cute too!\
I wonder if Haku kept his promise and met up with Chihiro. If he did, it would be wonderful!~\
The plot is interesting too. It has a \"wavy\" feel to it. And I like it.\
I don't really care about the art, but it was still pretty good. Especially how Haku is drawn. \
Overall, this was a pretty good movie. I'm hoping to find more Studio Ghibli movies and watching them. They must be good, if this movie and \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is\
          \
        pretty good.\

    Story 10/10\
The whole basis of the film was that Miyazaki wanted a film about a young girl that wasn't some lame love story- and that was the number one thing that I loved about the film. The whole thing is a masterpiece in the sense that it was like nothing I'd ever saw before. Chihiro is such a powerful character and the story reflects that. Watching it as a kid too it felt like I was watching something serious despite the fantasy qualities and the obvious child directed audience. Not to mention the way the story flows its a perfect balance of recognizing a calm\
          \
        before an arc and looking forward to what was coming next. Believe me, the reason people tell you to watch this one is because its the movie that even the most adamant anime-haters end up falling in love with.\
Art 10/10\
The whole movie is not only a great story, but a visual experience. The vibrant colours, the traditional Ghibli look mixed with this cool/cute/spooky spirit world was my dream as a child and even now I'm impressed by the technical skills required to pull that off. Like a spider character with a whole bunch of arms, each arm doing its own specific task, plus a face that requires its own expressions and movement, its just so impressive.\
Sound 10/10\
The sound was actually part of why this movie is so emotional. The trailer for this movie alone has the power to move me to tears because once you hear that soundtrack its like a flood of memories coming back. You know how you wish you could watch something over again and get that feeling of awe again? That never goes away with this movie\
Character 10/10\
Studio Ghibli presents us with a protagonist who is a very young, strong female character that shows a turn on what it means to be \"strong\". She never physically hurts anybody in the movie but she is spiritually and emotionally very strong in the sense that she faces her problems head on. And then the supporting characters are just that- supportive. There isn't so much a battle between good and evil so much as it is a journey to find good where it wasn't always expected. That isn't to say there isn't problems, but that no problem can't be fixed. The character design and personality was well thought out.\
Enjoyment/Overall 10/10\
For the above reasons its very memorable and I rewatch the movie any chance I get. If you haven't seen this movie yet- what are you still reading this for!? Go watch it !!!\

    The first time I saw Spirited Away, I was 8. Back then, I didn't know just exactly what I loved about the movie, but I couldn't stop asking my mom to go watch it again and again.\
Now, at 21 and having seen this movie more times that I can remember, I can say that Spirited Away is its music, the music is its art, the art is the spirit of the movie. They're all woven in a thin, fluid matter from which dreams are made. The story isn't meant to be taken at face value; it happens inside Chihiro's mind, but that doesn't mean it\
          \
        isn't real.\
I remember being a child and living adventures that happened completely inside my mind, but they existed. When I watch Spirited Away, that's what I remember; even now, when things are a bit difficult, I take a deep breath and images form in my mind - parallels of my real-world battles in a fantastic scenario.\
I certainly don't expect many people to think like me on this, and that's another beauty of this movie - people can see different meanings, different sides of the story, and all of them can be right. Even those who think the story is 'as thin as a paper'.\

    Spirited Away is a grandiose Miyazaki film about a young girl named Chihiro, a spoiled and self-centered girl who doesn't get used to the new town she's in. She soon is transferred to the Spirit World, where she learns to work and grow up with the help of a boy named Haku to help her get through her selfishness. It's a very unique film and I think this one is the BEST Hayou Miyazaki film ever created and a definite best of 2001. Spirited Away totally consoled my mind to be courteous even though you are getting out of things. I liked it better for\

    I have been wanting to see this movie even since I was little and saw castle in the sky for the first time. It was really good. I love that with all of his movies you can never tell where the story is going, everything is a mystery and nothing is generic. I thought the main character wasn't his best but she was alright and more typical than his other heroines. I loved all the side characters though they were all so amusing and none of them were flat, they all evolved and were not just animated forms of a certain emotion or stereotype. The\

        one thing that bothered me though was the ending, usually this director (whose name I can't spell and therefore haven't mentioned) has great endings and knows how to sum up a story with just one shot but Spirited Away's ending seem inconclusive to me, maybe they intended to do a sequel though I don't think so, I wish it had been more powerful but that is the only thing I would change, as always the art was amazing!!\

    My favorite among the Studio Ghibli productions that I've seen, the film speaks to a tender and beautiful side of humanity. \
A young girl ventures out with her parents to a mysterious park, where a series of magical transformations sends her into a realm beyond reality. With her parents imperiled, how can Chihiro rescue them and stay safe among the restless spirits?\
A DVD summary opener of course, the story is heartfelt and touching, invoking child-like innocence and purity against greed and misunderstanding. The actions and resolutions feel like a warm blanket wrapped around the viewer, comforting and encouraging. \
The art is gorgeous. Even the static\
          \
        backgrounds pop with life and detail, while the animation truly stands out as real and fluid with the setting. \
The music and voices are one for the records, with a score that pulls and pushes your heart-strings and acting that invokes clear and well-defined characters. \
This film sits proudly among many classics on my shelf, to be shown to anyone at the prompting of \"what's a good movie to watch?\" With no regard to the fact that's Japanese Animation.  \

    Spirited away is a beautifully told story, with great characters that you meet along the way as well as a brilliantly composed soundtrack. The main female character can be a bit frustrating at the beginning, however her progressive strength and kindness wins you over as the story continues. Overall a thrilling watch and definately one that an be watched over and over again. Fantastic :) \

    I must confess, this is the first anime film that got me back into watching anime. After almost a 7 year hiatus from watching anime, Spirited Away reeled me into what is, quite possibly the greatest Miyazaki film ever made. It is difficult to imagine the impact this film has had on culture all around the world. The first anime nominated for an Oscar is one hell of an achievement. It is difficult to praise this film without waxing lyrically but being my favourite film, I guess I cannot offer any meaningful criticisms of the film because there wasn't any for me.\
Perhaps to the uninitiated\
          \
        for this film, the best I can say is the sheer imagination that Miyazaki is capable of conjuring. From the unsettling characters at the bathhouse to the almost Steinbeck-esque portrayal of people moving on with their lives on a simple train journey is breathless. The attention to detail easily puts most films (anime or otherwise) to shame. The degree at which they go to animate seemingly trivial actions like putting on a shoe is fascinating. \
One could say, 'this is polish, nothing new' and I'd have to argue that Spirited Away is new, it invigorates so many things that directors do by deliberately shying away from the norm. The dialogue is pitch perfect, the writing and the animation is acutely aware of the audience's reactions and frequently subverts our expectations. Do you expect a lamp with a glove for a leg bouncing all the way to the train station to act as a guide? It is the surreal, dream-like experience that completely absorbs you.\
For the whole 2 hours, this film will transport you to someplace entirely and I'd say it does what anime has uniquely done better than their American contemporaries. That unique thing is something that you'll understand when you've reached the credits.\

    Spirited Away (A.K.A Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi) is probably my favourite movie. It isn't my favourite movie for no reason however.\
The sound is simply outstanding. Joe Hisaishi obviously tried his hardest to make the music fit perfectly to what's going on in the movie. He couldn't have done a better job. It'll encaptivate you until the very last minute.\
The movie has the characters very well done. Each character is unique and not just some cliché. Chihiro for example is just a normal girl who is a tad bit spoiled. Another character is No-Face(Kaonashi in Japanese). No-Face is an interesting character and is very difficult\
          \
        to make out. I've watched the movie six times and only understood No-Face when a person on the internet explained him/her to me. \

    Spirited away:\
All I can say about this is that It is as creative as It can get. Spirited away is full-packed with adventure, Fantasy, comedy and Thrill that’ll Keep you on your toes. Even though the Romance May seem scarce, It’s just the right amount to balance everything in the storyline.\
Once thing that I’ve noticed Is that even though the artwork Is a Bit old-looking, It doesn’t seem to affect the movie at all. In fact, It gives your eyes a fresh, New Thing to look over, and the sounds are just superb. \
Now, another thing I observed is that the fans are craving for\
          \
        more of spirited away. Imagine Haku being able to cross worlds and eventually, he finds chihiro. Wouldn’t that be nice? But see, It’ll not be spirited away anymore. The bathhouse full of gods, The train on the sea and everything will be amiss. Now if it’s the other way around, I don’t think it’ll be spirited away either. So they see eachother at last. Then what? Marriage? Have kids? Where is the adventure and fantasy that spirited away is all about? There isn’t any other plot to fill or top off the the original one. It will, in the end, disappoint you.\
One thing that spirited away lacks though, Is the flashback of the time when chihiro drowned in the river. I would have liked to see that, But anyway, Everything is just amazing, It’s beautiful the way it is. And besides, That’s what fanfictions are for.\

    Ahh.. I should have written this earlier. Oh well. This is honestly one of my favorite anime production movies. I've seen it before, and that was a pretty long time ago. And when I saw it recently, I was amazed. It still wowed me as much as it did when I was still in my elementary years. This is truly an anime that stood the test of time.\
Now, enough with the nostalgia. Let's get down to business. \
Spirited Away. The title pretty much says it all. That's pretty much the entire plot line and story that's in the movie. Not to mention the feeling the\
          \
        movie gives as one watches it. It literally gives you the feeling that you've been swept up, and thrown in another world. And as the title goes, the story is about a girl, who gets lost through a tunnel, and lands in a magical world. A world filled with many of Japan's great deities and demons. A land roaming with Spirits or the \"Yokai\" of Japan.\
The story line is great. The arrangement of the plots were definitely intriguing and astounding. The have done well in their planning and plotting. Sadly, the highest I could possibly give, would be a 7. \
Now, I don't have any problem with the plot line. In fact, it was superb. It's just that the ending felt very rushed. Perhaps it would have been even better if they had at least 20 or 10 minutes more near the ending. They could have definitely improved on that matter even with just a few minutes to let the flavor and the atmosphere kick in. That is the one thing I don't like in an anime. Poor story development at any part, and poor character development. Spirited Away also suffers with this problem. Some of the characters tend to just get thrown in scenes for no particular reason. And only around near the end do you find out that he was apparently relevant and important to the story. That part disappoints me.\
Don't worry though. It's not all bad. In fact, it'a about to get a whole lot better.\
What definitely got my attention the entire time was the amazing art. Hayao Miyazaki definitely hit with this one. The impressively animated scenery and the feeling that comes with it is really something you don't find that often in anime anymore. This is where I think, along with it's story line, Spirited Away got through its fans.\
The sound is also impressive too. With the background music and the sound effects fitting almost perfectly with the scenes, it just adds more to the ambiance that comes with it. The voicing in both the English and the Japanese versions were also impressive. \
All in all. This is a definitely \"must watch\" masterpiece. You don't get to find anime like this anymore, so I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something to watch and experience at the same time. I really think this anime will stand the test of time.\

    Spirited Away; not only one of the titles associated with anime in general, but also the very movie that introduced me to the splendid medium of Japanese animation. If said statement doesn't make me seem highly biased, then allow me to proclaim that this review most certainly is. I think it's natural to reserve a certain amount of one's affection for movies and books one associates with particularly pleasant memories and experiences. With this in consideration, I do acknowledge the vague possibility that Spirited Away's position as my favourite anime of all time is due to the fact that it was the first I ever\
          \
        saw. I had nothing to compare it to at all, and despite its minimal similarities to Alice in Wonderland I praised it as both original and engaging, two compliments that I still choose to use whenever I ramble on about it to my friends. But enough of my drabble, let's commence this biased excuse for a review!\
Story: 9/10\
His most famous movie may lack the environmental undertones of Princess Mononoke and the profoundly sincere charm of My Neighbor Totoro, but Hayao Miyazaki successfully managed to portray what he initially aimed for; how the departure from adolescence to adulthood is a tough transition filled with responsibilities and expectations. Cynical as it may be, this message is heavily incorporated into ten year old Chihiro, a prime example of a time-honored Ghibli heroine, as well as the protagonist in the movie who initiates a journey towards self improvement. This progress is decorated with a handful of fascinating characters, as well as the infinite virtue of Miyazaki's ability to craft excellent plots.\
The beginning plays out like a heavily altered version of Alice in Wonderland where a young girl suddenly finds herself wandering straight into a mysterious and occasionally frightening world. Where the two stories differ heavily though is when the plot in Spirited Away suddenly starts to make sense, and when Chihiro encounters several characters who aren't mentally deranged. Furthermore, Hayao Miyazaki has enough tricks up his sleeve in the form of twists and unexpected events to allow his narrative to ascend into further heights of creativity that definitely compares to Lewis Carroll. All in all, Spirited Away may borrow a few elements from other stories but it remains original and intriguing throughout, and it's a movie that at least I can enjoy over and over again.\
Animation: 9/10\
Many people would probably argue that the animation in Spirited Away is great, though nothing special that deserves to be praised and remembered. Be that as it may, I still find the visual direction to be absolutely splendid, a fact that my fetish for the typical \"Ghibli style\" contributes heavily to. Miyazaki's usual emphasis on the importance of traditional animation shines through brightly but is combined with the subtle and withdrawn use of computers to create a symbiosis where technology improves the artwork without taking control of it completely. This is highly beneficial when it comes to establishing a visually innovative and charming approach that still carries the classical feeling many anime fans grew up with.\
Among great backgrounds, fluid movement and a cleverly structured world, the aspect of the visual section that left the biggest impression on me was the character designs. Despite a few characters having dangerously few facial features, Chihiro herself looks absolutely terrific whenever her face contorts due to sudden emotion, and the main antagonist of the story is masterfully designed to hover between the border of frightening and restrained. All in all, I have no major complaints about the animation found in Spirited Away.\
Sound: 10/10\
Joe Hisaishi must be the wet dream of any director, within or outside of the medium of animation, and in Spirited Away he proves once and for all why it should be. The soundtrack uses a large variety of instruments and possesses the knowledge and power to realize what kind of melody and tone it needs to work perfectly in tact with the movie. Melodrama goes hand in hand with piano use or the violin, just like moments of a more quicker pace benefit from the enhancement of brass instruments. The melody 'One Summers Day' is not only one of the few anime tracks I know the name of, but it's also a piece of musical flare that I listen to regularly when I feel melancholic.\
Based on several re-watches, I don't think the performance of Rumi Hiiragi (Chihiro) is something that deserves particular recognition. It's far from bad but equally far from the splendour I personally associate with movies of such high production values. Overall, though, the acting is terrific with the antagonist Yubaba stealing the show together with her far more benevolent twin sister.\
Characters: 10/10\
Fundamentally speaking, character development is what comprises the very core of Spirited Away, as it decides to dedicate it's run time to the journey and growth of a young individual. But diversity is the key to success in characterization whether it be in an Anime or a novel, and so there are several other characters that enter the stage along Chihiro's path to either assist her, restrain her or just accompany the background with a lavish presence.\
Another thing Ghibli has a tendency of featuring is the lack of unrestrained evil. In the Disney universe, antagonists rarely boast any positive characteristics, and the ultimate goal for the far more virtuous heroes are to rid themselves of their evil by slaying them, and then life happily ever after with their beautiful princesses. In those cases, the evil is extreme, grisly and unredeemable. In the Ghibli universe however, even the antagonists are capable of feeling compassion, whether or not that compassion is restricted to close relatives or not. The evil witch Yubaba may thrive and benefit heavily from exploiting the services of her servants, but she displays a heavy amount of affection for her abnormally sized baby. Traits like those are what truly makes Spirited Away a charming piece of entertainment; there may be characters who exploit the weak and live in luxury without considering the well-being of their employees, but in the end the mysterious world they inhabit isn't plagued by terror and suffering but hard work and a modest, yet absolutely sufficient lifestyle. That carries an appealing charm in its own realm of prestige.\
Overall: 10/10\
If you didn't catch me the last time, Spirited Away is a movie that I watch regularly. Because of its almost harrowing ability to use music for emotional effect, as well as a dedication to thoroughly develop its relatable characters with splendour, it deserves all the praise it has received. I find it ironic that a person like me who usually goes for more eccentric stuff ended up considering one of the most generic titles to be his favourite, but that's the magic of Ghibli. Masterpieces gone mainstream!\

    It's strange, because regardless of the weird story, the unenjoyable script,  the random events and the unexplained, well, everything, it was still very enjoyable! It's just one of those things that you can't deny you've enjoyed, but you have no idea why. So this is my attempt to explain why...\
I think is uniqueness and strangeness is the reason it's so famous.\
Story:\
Strange story, not something that I would think I enjoy, in total honesty. So if it were a book,it would not have been nearly as good. It just a girl, going into this strange place, which turns out to be magical and works hard\
          \
        to get her parents back. But regardless of all that, the little events that really did not contribute to the outcome were fun to watch, and interesting. Like the 'no face' person who apparently eats humans, and yet randomly, is good at sewing (lol wtf?). But this randomness was funny, and entertaining. And the dragon boy person was a river? LOL, she's in love with a river? And the twin sister, one minute she turns the giant baby into a big mouse, and threatens to kill the river, and the next she's a whimsical little granny. There were so many other random events, that make it so funny and so random that you don't know what to expect. I'm sorry if I made it seem like a bad thing, but in fact, it's a good thing. The use of randomness in most films is horrible, but in this film in particular, it was really good.\
Art:\
There is no doubt, the art is outstanding. It is also another reason that I liked watching it regardless of its stupidity. The art guided me along. The sharp colors, and strangely creepy creatures (the granny XD) and everything else was just so good. Looking at it, it did feel like a fantastical world that is isolated from reality, and so it did what it intended.\
Sound:\
I have nothing to say about it. Nothing particularly interesting or uninteresting about the sound.\
Characters:\
As I said, I liked the weirdness within the characters. But I thought that Sen's character developed too fast. At first she was scared and everything, and then she was talking back to everyone, trying to get a job or whatever (and why she needs to get a job was never explained btw). But I think that was deliberate. But if only she wasn't as scared in the beginning, it would have seemed a lot more realistic.\
Enjoyment:\
It was, undoubtedly enjoyable, although it wasn't too rich in terms of story or character. What made it good was mostly the art, and the use of funny randomness.\
So it's definitely recommendable, but i have a feeling that this is the type of anime that people will interpret in different ways.\

    This is my first time writing a review here on mal (and in general) so sorry in advance, i will just share my love for spirited away,,\
So yeah, i really love spirited away. It might be a bias since i grew up watching it but let me tell u.\
My mom bought it for me, one year after it was released, when i was 1? years old (yeah, too young ik)(i still have the video tape). I cant remember anything from back then since i was too young, but i remember when i was around the age of 6, i\

        was in love with it. I would watch it everyday nonstop, i would replay my fav scenes again and again and i would dream about it. I am pretty sure ive watched this film more than 100 hundred times already. No exaggeration.\
 I feel like ive lived into the world of spirited away, and its so weird. Whenever i watch the film or i see screencap of it in any social media, i feel like ive been there and ive talked to those people in it(haku, yubaba, chihiro). It might be bacause ive dreamt abt it a lot since i was young. Traveling and walking around the place. I feel kinda lucky about it; experiencing this weird feeling. \
Remember the scnene where chihiro kneeled down, and wished to wake up because she was scared?(dont know how to explain this scene sorry) It might sound stupid, but chihiro taught me this way of waking up whenever i had a nightmare. Whenever i was scared inside my dreams, or had a nightmare i would do the same thing and i would wake up. It helped me so many times, and im thankful. I am really happy that this film exists.\
I hadnt seen anything like this before, and i didnt even know it was an animated movie back then. I dont know why i love this film so much, maybe it is because it taught me things that i still do and think abt today, being 16 years old, and my love for it hasnt changed and I am pretty sure that it will remain my favourite film for a long time. It holds a special place in my heart.\

    Story & Writing:\
Spirited Away exhibits the surreal power to transport the viewer into a dreamlike stupor, to yank them into a fairy tale world where age is an afterthought and logic is trite. The only thing that really matters is the childlike wonder and excitement that envelops anyone who sets foot into Spirited Away's world. The last Miyazaki movie I've seen do this was Howl's Moving Castle, but there is no comparing the magical power of Howl to Spirited Away; the latter spectacularly trumps the former.  \
Spirited Away's story is nothing complex nor guttural; it's very simple but in the best of ways and\
          \
        for the best of reasons. After all, how can you feel like a kid again if the adventure you're following is as convoluted as Star Wars? The story is just the straight main path. It's the detours you take and acquaintances you meet along the way that adds color to your world. And fucked if Spirited Away is short on detours and sights to see. \
The writing, as always for a Miyazaki film, is multi-layered and packed with detail. A child will understand 60% and still enjoy it, but an actively thinking adult will understand 100% and enjoy it even more. The dialogue may feel compact and simplistic at times, but that's not the only device through which the story is told; the characters' facial expressions, body movements, hand gestures, clothing, etc, etc, each tell a story of their own, and I feel as if only an adult, who has seen their fair share of human expressions and emotions, can truly pick up on the nuances that Spirited Away's myriad of storytelling devices offer.\
[Spoiler paragraph:\
My #1 favorite little detail lies at the end of the film: Chihiro's hairband glistens inconspicuously as she turns and look back one last time at the tunnel. This subtle light effect draws attention to her hairband, proving to the viewer that her journey was entirely real, and that maybe her journey will continue to live on and be \"real\" in the viewer's heart until the end of time. \
End of spoiler paragraph]\
Art:\
It's insane to even think that this entire movie is hand drawn and traditionally animated - there is not a lick of CG to be found. The staff's passions and emotions ooze from every single frame of animation and hand-painted background to appear during the movie's 2 hours. Spirited Away is an incredible passion project, and deserves to be called a masterpiece in every respect, rightfully lauded for its impeccable art design, aesthetic, and animation. \
Sound:\
The trademark Studio Ghibli orchestrated tracks and piano tracks are all amazing; they fit every scene and underscores emotions like no other.\
Enjoyment:\
10/10 \
Overall:\
10/10 \
I was glued to my seat, completely engrossed from start to finish. Watch it. It's an experience of a lifetime.",

    Brilliant animation and soundtrack? Absolutely! Good story? Eh... On the surface, if you're not able to spot the symbolism and message of the story, you can't really tell where the plot is going exactly. It's really a journey of the character more than anything else, seeing the main character develop into someone better. I loved the fantasy and supernatural elements of the whole fictional world setting. Overall though, I enjoyed it a lot! It's definitely a ways off from modern anime, which honestly is a breath of fresh air. Reminds me of the good old Disney films back then. Super solid, Studio Ghibli is the\

Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, or Spirited Away is a story about Chihiro, a recently uprooted girl that through a series of events, goes on a fantastical and slightly terrifying journey, growing up along the way.\
I'm just going to make this short and sweet, as you have plenty of other lovely reviews that go deep into this movie.\
Spirited Away made me happy. The art style gave me an adorable bouncy ball feeling, and I loved all the characters. I was never bored, and it twisted the plot in just the right ways. \
The movie really did spirit me away to a\
          \
        different, happier place for a while. And that's why I adore it so much.\
Final score: 10/10 for overall enjoyment, 4.5/5 for overall quality.\

    Warning possible Spoilers\
For being the first Studio Ghibli Movie/Film Spirited Away had a lot of pressure to impress me, but after finishing this film I thought it was amazing.\
It begins when Chihiro and her parents discover an abandoned amusement park, but when Chihiro's parents suddenly turn into pigs it's up to her to restore them back to normal.\
I loved the story , it was thrilling seeing Chihiro's journey to restore her parents human form while working at a huge and weird bathhouse which was the only way she could do it, at times the story can be mysterious, sometimes it can be adventurous and it\
          \
        can also be sweet.\
The film/Movie mostly had good pacing, but for some reason and don't ask me why the final quarter just felt rushed I mean it didn't impact the story at all, but I felt like something wasn't right and I can't explain why.\
Now the characters were very interesting it was fun watching Chihiro's character change from start to finish she started out being a bit of a whiner, but when she became the only person who could bring her parents back she adapted to the situation around her very quickly and I thought it was pretty inspiring seeing a 10 year old girl having to go through a lot just to bring her parents back.\
The other characters were ok and couldn't really offer a lot because they were either a barrier or an ally for Chihiro, but I thought they were pretty good for supporting characters.\
The artstyle was amazing if there's one thing you can say about this film/movie is that  it is beautiful, I loved the design of the bathhouse and the many different types of creatures and monsters that were in there too that Chihiro would either have to avoid or help out like the mud monster (which turned out to be a dragon) scene. \
This was a very enjoyable film/movie and if you're a Studio Ghibli fan I'd suggest watching this if you haven't already or if you're not a fan watch it anyway because it is a journey that you would want to stay on till the very end\

    Spirited Away was the very first anime movie I watched and in no way was I disappointed. This fun family friendly movie will bring you a satisfying dynamic story of a brave young girl who rescues her parents from a tragic flaw.\
Have you ever thought that there might be a place where spirits roam and find peace in the after life? I'm sure Chihiro didn't or should I say sen (you'll have to watch the movie to pick up on that reference). Chihiro finds herself mashed up in this world full of spirits, goblins, dragons, and even twin witches. This movie will make you feel\
          \
        like you are along the ride with Chihiro. You see this young girl Chihiro really change dynamically throughout the film and it really is an inspiring outcome to how she is in the end.\
 The truly remarkable thing about this movie is the creativity behind the actual story. The writers and creators built this visual but imaginary world of creatures that is truly something I have never seen before. The set design of the entire movie is nothing less than marvelous. The spectacle of it all is what truly gets me. \
This is a movie that has been around for a long time. Its sentimental value and inspiring themes continue to touch the heart of each viewer. It is highly rated and I would be the first to recommend it to any beginner or veteran anime watcher. \

    Spirited Away comes from the great Miyazaki. Of all of his films, this is his most well-known and perhaps most beloved as well. The story follows a girl who enters a mysterious world full of creatures and demons. It is about both hope and finding happiness in the heart of a child.\
PROS\
The art here is as good as it could be, for its time. The characters, in particular, really come alive as the story progresses. Buildings and creatures seem real, as if they could come out of the screen and touch you. This adds a lot to the fantasy element of Spirited Away. The viewer\
          \
        becomes entranced by all of the animation and stays in a dreamlike state for the entire movie. Truly mesmerizing visuals.\
Characters are brought up early and later on in the anime. Some of them are good, and some are bad. All, though, are very unique in terms of personality. The main girl has the best character of all, which is no surprise to those who know about the past work of Ghibli - the studio behind this project. \
CONS\
The only negative of this movie is that the visuals, while impressive, have died down a bit since the film first came out. This may be a problem to some, though I would hope not. It still is an amazing thing to look at, whether you have high standards or not. \
OVERALL\
I didn't have much to say about Spirited Away due to the fact that everyone has pretty much had their say on this great film. It's a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come. I encourage both parents and their children to seek this film out, preferably on Blu-Ray (if it's available). This is a must have!\

    If you enjoy watching anime or even movies, you have had to heard of Spirited Away at least once. This masterpiece by Hayao Miyazaki, creator of other remarkable animations such as: Lupin III, Future Boy Conan, My Neighbor Totoro, Porco Rosso etc. is the most successful film in Japanese history. It topped Titanic which is an incredible feat and still lives on as one of the best films of our generation. \
\
-Story- [10]\
   The movie begins with Chihiro, a sullen 10-year-old girl, moving into a new town with her family. On the way to their new house, they take a little detour into\
          \
        an abandoned amusement park that becomes alive at night with spirits as the visitors. While her parents are pigging out (quite literally) on one of the food stands, she decides to do a little exploring and runs into a mysterious young boy that warns her and tells her to run away. Confused by the whole situation our main protagonist goes back to her parents to find that they have turned into hungry, free loading pigs. \
   She is trapped in this uncanny place with nowhere to go and no one to trust except the mysterious boy that she has just met. He tells her that she has to work in order to stay as a human and leaves her with instructions on how to acquire a job. However that is easier said than done as she is lead to the owner of the bath house; an unforgiving witch who refuses to let Chihiro work. Constant begging accompanied with crying of a very large baby, she is able to convince the evil witch into giving her a job. Thus begins the magical journey of love, compassion, bravery, deception, hardship, and the will to never give up.\
There really is nothing to hate about the story of Spirited Away. From start to finish, you follow Chihiro as she learns to be independent and grow into a capable young lady in this terrifying adult world. The story is simple for younger audiences to follow along while portraying a deeper meaning for an older audience to ponder about. Every time I watch this movie I find something new, nothing big, just an extra little detail that I may have not noticed or even cared about before. It's incredible how in depth the story actually is with countless morals and themes that are involved. I don't think I have ever seen such a pure and innocent love story. Definitely a better love story than Twilight, 10 out 10.\
\
-Art/Sound- [10]-[10]\
The art style and the animations are phenomenal. There is something happening on almost every single scene. The characters move and act so lifelike it's hard to believe that it has been over a decade since the film has been released. There are a plentyl of impressive set pieces you encounter that seems too \"real\" because of how natural everything is. Atsushi Okui, who was in charge of the cinematography, has really outdone himself in animating what Miyazaki has envisioned in his mind. It couldn't have been done any better - a solid 10 out of 10.\
My favorite thing about this whole film is the musical score. The music works so incredibly well with the entire atmosphere and the setting; it might as well be a part of the dialogue itself. It is not too overwhelming, at the same time powerful enough, that no amount of dialogue is befitting to create the mood/emotion a scene can offer. Once again a perfect 10 out of 10 no arguments here.\
\
-Character- [10]\
The characters in Spirited Away are unique to say the least. Most of the characters in the film are spirits, you can easily identify them by their appearance. The spirits may look different from humans, however; they act and think in the same mannerisms as humans do. Only major difference beyond the looks would be that night is day for them since they are of course spirits. One of the more intersting spirit in the film is No-Face, a loner spirit who gains admission to enter the bath house by Chihiro. \
The major characters are very well thought out and likable. Rin being one of them, is a loud mouth outgoing worker in the bath house that becomes Chihiro's aqcuintance and a mentor. She teaches Chihiro eveything from ground up and become a support for chihiro, making the whole situation a little less of a burden for our little heroine. The more important character would be Haku, the one I mentioned as \"a mysterious young boy\". He is the errand boy for the owner of the bath house, Yubaba, who helps Chihiro greatly in her ordeal. 10 out 10.\
\
-Enjoyment- [10]\
Why would I watch a single movie so many times if it wasn't enjoyable? Although I do have a tendency to rewatch a lot of movies (check out Shawshank Redemption, City of God, and How to Kill a Mockingbird if you haven't already). This movie will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. From astonishing visuals and audio to exceptional plot management, everything is done right. It's simply a bliss to watch that cannot be described in words. 10 out of 10.\
\
-Overall- [10]\
Now, I haven't criticized a single thing about this movie because it really has none. The only thing bad about it is that it ends. Even the dubs are done fantastically. I have watched it in Japanese, Korean, and English versions of the movie and it was perfect. All the voice actors fit their part and nothing was out of the ordinary. I've seen a great deal of excellent films but never a movie that makes you feel that no matter how old you are, there is a kid in all of us. A cinematic masterpiece such as this comes out every so often, Miyazaki has left us with another memory that will forever be engraved in our hearts.\

    *All my reviews are intended for readers who have never watched the anime before*\
There is simply no denying that Miyazaki is the Godfather of Japanese Animation, time and time again delivering unto the public works of such incredible beauty, such stunning visual and sensory delights, such mastery of storytelling, that one can only be left speechless. Overwhelmed. Intoxicated with wonder. Such is the magic of Spirited Away.\
Story-line: 9\
Spirited Away has this enchanting ability to use such a unique and out there risky story-line to grab your attention and make the best out of this wonderful movie. As you follow Chihiro's story you really pause at\
          \
        some moments and question the events occurring. BUT you continue to watch, why? Because some of the plot may be different and while it is a bit outside the box, it works amazingly and you cannot take your eyes off the screen! \
Art/Animation style: 9\
For a 2001 animated film, Spirited Away brings more to the floor than a lot of recent year anime I have watched, movie and/or series. Everything is colourful, so colourful it makes you feel like you are with Chihiro through her experience. The character graphics are a bit old fashion even for this movie but regardless, the way they use this flaw to their advantage to effectively fit the storyline really works nicely to make a pretty box with a ribbon on top, handing you this great animated movie in a present to cherish!\
Sound: 9\
Holy cow ... the soundtrack of Spirited Away, just, words cannot describe the FANTASTIC job done in this department. After you watch Spirited Away just listen to the soundtrack and you will once again appreciate the expertise, even after watching it. The use of the soundtrack is what makes this anime even better, they use these beautifully emotional and cinematic music at the perfect time to draw you in and better appreciate the act or scene to its fullest.\
Character: 8\
The characters in Spirited away are by far the most unique area of this anime. I do feel they fit very well with the story-line and artwork although the ideas were a bit out there for me so that is why this area is an 8, lower than the rest, for me.\
Despite that I have to give Miyazaki, the director and the voice actors a pat on the back for the excellent job well done on the two main characters of this work, Chihiro and Haku. These two are the perfect fits for Spirited Away's story-line, as you watch you will be drawn into their character's shoes to really appreciate the work put into their journey. Without giving away any spoilers I feel this is the bases I will leave the Main Characters at and allow you to find out what is in store for Chihiro and Haku.\
Finally, along with main characters, the supporting characters are done nicely in helping develop Chihiro and Haku very well. As you watch Spirited Away you will hopefully appreciate the job done on each supporting characters' role as much as I, or more than I did.\
Enjoyment: 9\
Take a moment, sit back, breath in deeply, breath out slowly. STOP. Continue to read the following while you are relaxed. \
Imagine you are in a movie theatre, every seat is filled and children scream, people are chatting, everything is quite loud while advertisements are playing. Then suddenly, like a blink of an eyelash everyone shuts up. You all sit back quietly in your seats and glue your eyeballs to the screen. After the fact you stand up and say \"wow\". No one spoke a word throughout the movie, no one got up and left due to fear of missing another great scene. Your mind is blown, your eyes are appreciating the job well done, your ears are now admiring the wonderful soundtrack.\
This experience is literally the sum up of my enjoyment of Spirited Away. Such an odd experience to fit such a bizarre but yet stunning animated film!\
Overall I give Spirited Away a 9/10 for Miyazaki's stellar job well done! \

     I will almost garentee you, you will love this heartwarming tale of love, happiness, and feels in this movie, and you will wish for a sequel! But Where do I start with Spirited Away? Spirited Away is about a selfish 10 year old girl who ends up facing this land of spirits on her own, working at a ath house with other spirits who bully her. Some may look human, but they are NOT. Watch chihiero(can't spell it) face her fears and encounter herself being courageous, and bravery is key for her survival with the bath house master, yobaba. With a little help with\
          \
        her new friends. It's pretty hard to explain, but this is my first anime I watched when I was a little younger than 5. I never, ever, get bored of this anime and could watch it over, and over, and over again. I give it a 10/10 it's my favorite movie, and I recommend it completely. Some people don't even try it just because of the art work. I personally watched it dubbed, and for some reason never realized it was subbed, because when I first watched it, it was on t.v dubbed. If you're picky you'll notice some words don't match up, but since I am so used to the dubbed, I hate the subbed version. I get the feels from the dubbed, and I could assure you, you won't be disappointed. So sit comfortably on your couch, get the popcorn and a soda, and DO NOT FORGET TO PAUSE WHEN YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM!! \

    I first watched this when I was around 7 or 8, and I became completely obsessed with it. Since then, I've probably re watched it 20 something times, probably even more. Ever since watching this film, I've been in love with Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli's work.\
Story - A young whiny girl named Chihiro is moving. On the way, her parents make a wrong turn in the car and they end up at an abandoned theme park. At night, her parents mysteriously transform into pigs, and Chihiro becomes surrounded by spirits. She meets a boy named Haku who takes her to a bath house ruled by\
          \
        a witch named Yubaba to get a job so that she can stay in the spirit world. This sounds very corny, and hardly does the actual story any justice. Watch the actual movie, and you'll see how great the story is. Throughout this animated film, you witness Chihiro developing into nearly an entirely different character. It's really quite astounding.\
Art - The art is absolutely gorgeous. The scenery and backgrounds are amazingly drawn. It's very detailed, and fits the scenes very well. As corny as this sounds, every time the wind blows through the grass, I can nearly feel a gust of wind on my face too! Character designs were great as well, I might add. \
Sound - I think this may be the strongest point. The soundtrack is amazing, to put into simple words. It fits so well with each scene, just like the art. Joe Hisaishi is a great composer, and I can tell he really put his heart and soul into the creation of the music. I particularly enjoyed \"One Summer's Day\" and the ending song, which I don't know the name of.\
Character - I love each and every character in this anime, literally. I didn't like Chihiro much at all at first, but I ended up liking her a lot in the end because she changed so much. Each character was unique and likable. Not too often will you see characters like the ones in Spirited Away.\
Enjoyment - Basically, I enjoyed this anime and I still do even though I've watched it 20+ times. :P I think this is really one of the best anime out there. I highly recommend it to any anime fan out there. It's great in all aspects. I honestly don't understand anyone who gave this a negative review.\

    When I first heard about this movie, I thought that it would be very boring and stupid, a very cliched movie. That is exactly what happened the first time I watched it, but after trying it a second time... I was amazed. \
First, I'll talk about the parts I didn't like.\
One part that I didn't really like that much was the character. Sure, there was character development, but it was limited. The characters just didn't seem to be thought out well. Their personalities all blended into one, and seemed cliched. Haku was the average wonder boy, while Chihiro was the whiny little brat.\
Another part I\
          \
        didn't like very much was the romance in the story. To put it simply, the romance between Haku and Chihiro. It was very barely mentioned, and when it was, I didn't quite understand it. It lacked depth.\
The overall story was good though. The story line seemed defined and not bland, unlike the first time I watched it, when the story was unclear and confusing. The artwork amazed me, making me feel like I was actually living there, walking on the dirt, and breathing in the air. It was a place I never wanted to leave.\
 I enjoyed the film very much.\

    As usual, Studio Ghibli produced another rich and slick animation. The audio is great and the colours vivid. I find it produces a sense of wonder, surrealism and escapism.\
The first time I watched this was in parts, and most of the time I was confused and yet engrossed. However, the animation has since grown on me. The storyline is pretty straight forward when you watch it carefully.\
Excellent stuff!\

    Spirited away, is a great moovie that without much objectionable content or sad/dramatic events can teach us morals such as how to mature and how to stand for things you want or love. It is a moovie that may be understanted by all ages and that will teach something to anybody who whatches it.\
I consider it entertaining and at the same time an easy to watch and beautiful moovie.\
I also liked it due to the fact that the main character and heroine of the story was a girl, and actually her role was way more epic that the roles of many male protagonists in many\
          \
        anime series.\

    Another one of Miyazaki's genius movies. This one HAS to be one of my favorites out of all of them. The story is very interesting, the animation is unique somehow and the characters will charm you. There are some humor moments, mostly its drama. There aren't much romance scenes actually theres only a few and they would hardly pass as romance scenes. Towards the end they cry with both hands entwined, then when Chihiro is about to go home for good Haku makes a promise to her that he will see her again, they show a short scene of them letting go of each other's\
          \
        hands (sad T_T). Really, Miyazaki has the tendancy to catch your attention even without romance so i'd recommdend watching even tho there's no romance. \

         I have heard of so many people that have \"heard\" of Spirited Away, but never watched it. I basically forced my friends to watch it, in which they don't enjoy anime, and they fell in love with it.\
     The story is about a selfish girl named Chihiro that is moving to a new town. Her nosy parents take a wrong turn, but decide to explore the area they were in. \
     They end up turning into PIGS! The only way for Chihiro to get her parents back is to learn to trust\
          \
        herself to get a job at a spirit bathhouse. During this, she makes a few new friends, and ends up appreciating what she has, and that moving really isn't so bad.\

    Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away... I would say his best film or arguably one of the best animates Disney films.\
Story\
The story was a bit strange I must say. It was a little hard to get if you were the one half asleep watching this as I was, but the second time I watched this I felt like an idiot not getting it. The story really grabs you, but then again there are parts that make you go 'hmmmm.' It is astounding how a single man could come up with this! Magi really.\
Art/Animation\
You don't see anything like this anymore. The animation is interesting and breath-taking. The characters\
          \
        are also VERY unique and drawn in a very unusual way. The way Miyazaki animates is interesting. He is a very realistic animator. Everything he animates is based off what someone would really do. Like the scene when Chihiro was putting her shoes on, she didn't just slip them on, she put them on as if she were a real person. That struck me once I saw it.\
Sound\
To be blunt, the music could have been much better, but it does not in anyway ruin this film.\
Characters\
As I already stated, they are all drawn in unusual ways, but they look amazing. My favorite would have to be the Stink Spirit. It was wildly drawn and it really looked like it stunk x_x\
Overall, I loved it! and so did my 6 year old sister! We watched it a lot. It is truly a beautiful work of masterpiece. The art is amazing and it really what makes this movie a masterpiece. Go Miyazaki!\

    STORY: YAYYY!!!! no idea what the fuck is going on lol. just writing this review on the spot with nothing in mind just trying to remember umm... the story, the story was rather different, not what i expected at all, i'm actually having trouble with describing it, when i finished the movie i was all like trying to collect information in my mind, as in WHAT JUST HAPPEND! there are lots and lots of interesting things to look at and think about, lots of originality which i enmbrace in a story, it's nothing 'like you've ever seen before.\
ART:i love studio ghibli art, possibly because of\
          \
        howls moving castle which was the first ghibli movie i saw... that probably made me love the art in this one. but it's different art, and the way everyone and everything is drawn really bring out the moods and feelings and realism of the characters and scenery. \
SOUND:i don't remember much of the sound, but i know i didn't complain about it, it's good.\
CHARACTER:they felt increadibly human at times, even the old dude with the 34234 arms haha he seemed rather scary at first but then later through the story he seems quite kind and trusting like a family member. the characters were enjoyable and unique.\
ENJOYMENT:i watched it twice good stuff, might watch it again at some point, it was very interesting at times i want more GHIBLI!\

    This movie was utterly captivating for me. It has been a long while since I last watched it, but I still remember how hooked I was and how much I loved it. I also almost cried during this movie, something I don't do often.\
First, the art and music was almost perfect. Of course, since it came out in 2001, the animation doesn't have the same high quality as more modern anime, but it works perfectly well for its purpose. The music was outstanding and made the whole movie flow brilliantly - hindrance was never an issue here.\
The characters were amazing, with Chihiro shown to be\
          \
        resourceful and intelligent and all the other characters having their own little quirks that make them unique. Never did I feel that a character was unnecessary or forced. Each one, although maybe not vital, had a decent part to play in the overall plot and most definitely helped the story move forward.\
Lots of creativity was shown with the plot and story, with a unique twist on the 'trapped in another world' theme. I loved that so many things happened within the main story and they all helped to build up the atmosphere of the move before the finale. I was hooked on all the little details that meant so much when they all piled up. \
Truly, this was an amazing movie; it has to be, considering this is the only anime I have ever rated as 10/10 overall. This movie is one for the ages and is a masterpiece in cinema. It is aimed at children, so of course it won't be to everyone's tastes, but it is something that you can at least appreciate if not fall in love with.\

They later reappeared in Spirited Away as workers in Kamaji's boiler room. They are small, black as soot and apparently fuzzy, with spherical bodies and two inquisitive eyes. They move by hovering around, but they can extend stick-like legs and arms from their bodies to do certain tasks, and can lift objects many times heavier than their own weight. They make a squeaky murmuring sound when excited, and dissolve into powder (soot) if crushed.  \
 In My Neighbour Totoro, the house the main characters move into is full of Susuwatari, which are rationalized as Makkuro Kurosuke (pitch-black blackie), an optical illusion caused by moving quickly from light into darkness. Later, the family drives the Susuwatari out of the house, as the home that was once abandoned is now inhabited. They would move to another abandoned area. \
 \
 In Spirited Away, the protagonist Sen (Chihiro) befriends a number of them by helping them carry coal. Sen is told that if these Susuwatari aren't given a job to do, they turn back into soot. Another character, Lin, feeds the Susuwatari much like farmers feed chickens, throwing handfuls of the Japanese candy Kompeito onto the ground for them to eat. \
