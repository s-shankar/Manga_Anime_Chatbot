This marks the beginning of an uneasy agreement between the Shogunate and Amanto, one that results in a countrywide sword ban and the disappearance of the samurai spirit. However, there exists one eccentric individual who wields a wooden sword and refuses to let his samurai status die. Now that his kind are no longer needed, Gintoki Sakata performs various odd jobs around town in order to make ends meet. Joined by his self-proclaimed disciple Shinpachi Shimura, the fearsome alien Kagura, and a giant dog named Sadaharu, they run the business known as Yorozuya, often getting caught up in all sorts of crazy and hilarious shenanigans.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=226,  ["text"]="              \n    Ah, Gintama. One of the best and most complete current manga in Jump. Its premise is intriguing and unique (aliens in historical Japan? Who would have thought it?). It has great characters--ranging from the diabetic lazy samurai Gintoki to the samurai who has a mayo addiction Hijikata to the stalker ninja Sa-chan and so on. All of them blend together well without feeling out of place and flat. No matter where Sorachi puts them in, they always get at least one huge guffaw from me. Its brand of comedy doesn't consist only of repetitive and sometimes obscure references, but it's also a very satirical commentary\n          \n        on Japanese society reflected in feudal Edo. Though Gintama is first and foremost a gag manga, with all chapters merely snippets of the Yorozuya's different interactions with themselves and other people in the Amanto (Gintama's term for aliens)-filled Edo, Sorachi Hideaki manages to slip in a few serious action arcs to show a little semblance of an actual plot. And when he does, he brings his A-game. All serious arcs in Gintama are great, they either keep you on the edge of your seat eagerly anticipating what happens next or reduce you to a bawling little girl with every sudden sad twist. Sorachi Hideaki definitely is a master at balancing hearty laughs with testosterone-laden action and heartwarming drama without it feeling shoehorned in to the story. Gintama is already an awesome manga but it could use an improvement in the art department. Don't get me wrong, I'm no art connossieur, but sometimes the characters look stiff and hastily done but other than that there really is nothing to complain about. Comedy and action rarely mix together well, but in Gintama it does perfectly. With well-written storylines and almost uncanny comedic sense, Sorachi Hideaki's Gintama should not disappoint. GO. READ. IT. NOW.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=147,  ["text"]="            \n    \"At its heart Gintama is a science fiction human pseudo-historical comedy. The bottom line is that this is a nonsense manga. But I don't believe in telling readers what to think, so read it any way you like.\" - Hideaki Sorachi.\nGintama is a fantastically creative work with an endless appeal; as consistent, funny and compelling now as it was five years ago.\nThe story - for the most part - is told in a rather episodic fashion, with each chapter presenting a different plot. These chapters are largely comedic and follow the huge cast finding themselves in all sorts of hilarious situations. Hideaki Sorachi - the\n          \n        author - makes use of many ingenious gags and plot devices to avoid repetition, and also explores a variety of story arcs which add a sense of heightened drama to an otherwise predominantly humourous series. The story arcs expand on the characters in a way the stand-alone chapters cannot, and add more variety and narrative to the series. Certain chapters are better than others, but Sorachi rarely falters - he keeps up the momentum after all these years and still manages to present consistently brilliant stories, ideas, characters and concepts.\nSorachi rarely uses any sketchy effects in his artwork, nor does he display much shading. His lines are very bold and he almost never makes use of double page spreads. Gintama, however, does not require such extravagance. It is a fairly dialogue-heavy manga and while it does contain action, it is a predominantly comedic series. Sorachi pays close attention to panel placement and timing to best communicate his comedy to the reader. Artwork is half that communication, however, and Sorachi never misses the mark. His artwork has steadily improved since the series' inception and his character designs are a real stand-out element.\nOver the years, Sorachi has built up a phenomenally large supporting cast, along with three unforgettable main characters. Some supporting members have almost become as integral as the main cast itself, with Sorachi making sure no-one goes amiss; he frequently uses his supporting characters no matter how minor to the story they may be. Certain characters are more well-rounded than others, but such is the nature of a gag-based series; Gintama's characters needn't be intricate, complex beings. The story arcs greatly expand on the cast, however, adding background and a soul to characters otherwise present solely for comedic relief, all the while opening up new directors and opportunities for them to take.\nThe comedy in Gintama has a fantastic range; from toilet humour to meticulously executed gags to parodies of popular culture, both Japanese and Western. The series displays a rich assortment of genres and a full embrace of its fanatical setting; creativity and imagination run wild. Despite being a predominantly comedic series, Gintama has so much more to offer; in its characters, its setting, its sheer originality and inventiveness - it's a manga that keeps on giving and one not to be missed.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=49,   ["text"]="          \n    *This review was originally for Bankara and has consequently been merged into Gintama*\nThis a one shot, that was like been written like one, so I will try to be fast.\nBankara is a parody of the society, and some other things, written from one my favorites mangakas Sorachi Hideaki. It talk about the way that our world is walking on and \"growth\" on. It's a society with many problems, more of them even the people don`t really understanding them. Most of the people are trying to find there way to the freedom, delinquents often are being seen like that. In this manga they are like the\n          \n        stupid rebels, the normal students are like the people of the grown society and someone, our girl, have the mission to protect the morals, the law and the peace of this society, but even she don`t really understand it, she is just force to do it. In society like that come someone like our hero. He is coming from the past, actually from a society with almost the same problems, they just become even bigger with the time. But even then he could become what he is... He is no really so great man, that is doing revolution to change the world or something like that... No, no... He is simple destroying with brutal strength. He is destroying everything that he one of this bullshits. And this is written to us, the young people, because we are the future and he want to tell us to stop believing in the hypocrisy of out society and to brake out of it's prison when our senses of real freedom (if we really one to call this freedom) are the best.\nP.S. Sorry for my poor writing skills on this language, and of course you always have the right to think about me like an idiot, because i believe that this manga is actually good. But you are human too, therefore you are an idiot too.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=43,   ["text"]="          \n    *This review was originally for 13 and has consequently been merged into Gintama*\nStory:\nIt's from the creator of Gintama,  Hideaki Sorachi so you would expect some ridiculous slapstick humour, action and even a bit of drama, this one shot definitely delivers in  aspects in even with its length. This could have even worked as an episode of Gintama. Despite being a One Shot, it manages to make a the story interesting enough, although it does help you appreciate it more if you're already a  fan of Gintama since it would be easier for you to \"get\" the humour.\nArt:\nThere isn't anything about the art\n          \n        that can be considered outstanding, still the overall quality of it is decent. The character design and art is mostly simplistic but it has it's own charm.\nCharacters:\nGiven that this was a One Shot it hardly left any room for character development but it did manage to make the two central characters interesting enough.\nOverall:\nI felt that it could have fleshed out the story a bit more with a few more pages of Golgo's hilarious attempts to assassinate Fujieda but all in all it was enjoyable for what it was, definitely worth the read if you're a fan of Gintama/Sorachi or just looking for a short comedy/action manga to read \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=29,   ["text"]="            \n    Who doesn’t enjoy reading idioms and puns almost every other manga window? Granted that you also don’t mind some fun jokes tossed in your direction, I’m pretty sure that you’re going to be satisfied with this series. One can be sure to say that resistance to at least some laughing is purely futile in this series. From chapter one, I cannot say that I have not at least laughed less than perhaps 50seconds to almost every single chapter. Maybe it’s just me that is often easily amused, but this series is anything but commonplace, dull, or morose.\nRevolving around the last reigns of the samurai era,\n          \n        we are introduced to this new sort of Edo, Japan and world. It is one that includes co-existence with \"aliens,\" also known as Amanto. The main protagonists make encounters with those who are trying to live their life the way the want to and can, those who are trying to protect the current way of living, and those who want to remove the current situation and return back to traditional ways of life. It’s as though there’s a new sort of \"bureaucracy\" running amok now that aliens are trying to change lifestyles on the Earth. And so, the story embarks on the many adventures and confrontations that this main characters’ team strikes upon. Beginning from little side, freelance jobs that the team accepts from others to major battles against revolutionists that the team fights for others, the characters and stories develop and change with inclusions of comedy and drama.\nThe most important aspects that struck my interest were probably the insanely funny moments and expressions put into this series. From chapter to chapter there is some insertion of some sort of theme of fun and/or comedy. And yet, don’t get me wrong; this isn’t entirely something just for laughs. The drama incorporated into this brilliantly devised series is fascinating to read as well. At times, however, one may ponder, \"wait, how was this relevant to anything?\" That’s the thing. The story is like a maelstrom of randomosity and episodicity. In other words, I’d say that the audience is flung into this mess of small arcs and \"filler-like\" sequences/storylines and well, into random new \"alternate universes,\" too. Additionally, the story generally has fairly dreadful transitions; you’re hopping from one story to the next basically after each \"mini-arc;\" and some times, you may just get altogether confused, perplexed and even angry by the all the hysteria. Moreover, there’s always a tinge of \"predictability\" in what will surely happen. As unappealing as that may sound, it’s actually still amazingly fun to read. Although the ridiculousness of this series is incredible, I don’t believe that I wasted any of my time experiencing any of it. I thoroughly enjoyed myself just reading about random \"philosophies\" and so-called \"life lessons\" from the stories involved in this series. Then even though the small arcs and \"real\" storylines that the mangaka does work around are actually very intriguing and exciting to read more about, I can’t suppress my anticipation for more of the \"main\" storyline to continue forward.\nRegardless, I believe that the elements of adventure, comedy, drama, suspense, thrill, and tragedy are all thoroughly integrated into this story even if it may seem too randomized and episodic. Nothing is tremendously wrong with something that doesn’t dive straight into a detailed and convoluted or direct and simplistic plotline. One should just appreciate the hearty comedy that is fed directly to him, honestly. Maybe I’m being too obsessive when I say that? Nah, I won’t deny the fact that there have been a couple chapters where I was like, to the mangaka, \"Um, Sorachi-sensei, why did you even bother writing and drawing about such plainness?\" For example, there have been a couple chapters regarding completely irrelevant topics to the manga story or main characters. But, c’mon really? I still laughed my head off and enjoyed the read thoroughly because of its insight and hilarity. Altogether, the stories that this mangaka expresses and illustrates are of great ingenuity and practicality. Wait, did you catch that? Yes, I did say practicality because, to say the least, I felt like I’ve learned more (about life and its whims) from this series than from all of my exposure and experiences with other anime and manga. Even so, if you’re thinking that there’s still no point of reading something without a solid plotline, you’re mistaken. This is a series that’s perhaps going to inspire you to think about certain matters differently. And, hey, I think that’s an admirable feat and offering to an audience. Thus, don’t feel like it’s going to be an entire waste of your time on this series.\nAnyway, let’s move onto another significant factor (maybe not the best \"number two\" evaluation tool but whatever) when one decides to read manga… The art. Now, this is not at all an issue. I actually find the art-style more unique and clean than most other styles. This isn’t your \"typical\" Shounen Jump art or something full of GAR-like characters. [[Then again, what’s qualified as \"typical,\" eh?]] This has a great mixture of almost shoujo-like but still shounen-like artistry. Furthermore, the background designs and incorporations of other illustrates besides character designs are very neat and pretty to view. Yet, I can’t say that this series contains the best art ever because it really isn’t the best of the best. Even so, I believe that the imagery and scenery are both illustrated in extremely appropriate methods and styles. There have been a few characters and some random usages of crazy-looking characters but it just adds to the overall hilarity of the story itself. Furthermore, some characterizations and portrayals are probably done for further amusement. I did indeed get some great laughs from some fun character insertions Sorachi provided. Then, the way and style of which he was able to draw out action scenes and also \"thriller-scenes\" and then \"emotional scenes,\" and well every other \"dramatized\" scene were altogether masterful and skillful. Moreover, the flow of scenes in each story was further emphasized and clearly offered to the audience; never was anything too abrupt or confusing. Everything about the art did help add to my enjoyment of this series. In conclusion, the art proved to be impressive and helpful to move the story and interest forward.\nThirdly, about the characters and their personalities… To be honest, I don’t think that there’s a single character that just annoys me to an extremity; and I believe that is important for some who think that a single character can ruin a story. The personalities really do grow on you in spite of the fact that there some initially slightly bothersome persona out in the series… Then again, you can’t really blame people to act certain ways because it’s just in their particular nature to do so… A person can only be so nice and only be so mean? Meh, I’m not trying to say that everyone is perfectly likable at the first introduction; since, you’ve got your typical weak main character who strives to become stronger and then, your fairly strong character that’s always winning fights, then you’ve got your typical random jokers and clowns around, too. Even so, you grow to understand why these characters are these ways and well, at least for me, learn to appreciate each and everyone's existence. The development of these characters is fairly random, but, Sorachi does take the time to give each character almost realistic personality and spirit. All characters also take the opportunity to actually learn and feel from certain experiences that are essentially important to real life as well. Furthermore, no one is extremely dull or boring to further read about. After certain characters are introduced, I personally felt an urge to find out more about that one person. There were a couple folks that didn’t get much of a huge spotlight as well as some who got too much \"camera-time.\" Nevertheless, I thought everyone was generally described and portrayed in a more or less distributive and fair way. As with most series, once you’ve laid your eyes on one particular character, you’re almost guaranteed that you will enjoy the descriptions and details entailing that character because of the elaborations and creativity of the plot as well.\nFinally, the enjoyment factor. Although this series is random as much whatever else random series you’ve probably read/watched before, I have to say that this can deliver greater and heartier laughs. There are also a few of times where you can also shed a tear or two in this series, thus you’re not just enjoying the whirlwind of ridiculousness 24/7. The drama and suspense entanglement also draws one into the series since there are sometimes \"cliffhangers\" that you just are at a point where you’re struggling to know more. The characters themselves are also eventually lovable as before mentioned. Then, the philosophies and puns spun in every direction towards you are also just exciting and amusing to read. All in all, even with the extreme randomness, the series has practically every element to a so-called \"great story\" that is possible; with substance or not, this story never ceases to entertain the audience in one way or another.\nLastly, although this sounds like a bunch of tedious ramblings, I do hope that you, whoever, reads this, do give this manga a try. By no means am I saying that this is the most perfect manga ever because it still rivals against a lot of greater epics, but this is a grand treasure chest in the ocean of manga. It’s yet another classic series that deserves more credit than it’s granted. And wouldn’t you want another series \"just for laughs?\" [ps. I know that this \"just for laughs\" phrase has a copyright, hence the quote marks. Also, don’t you go thinking, \"Oh, the anime was only so-so, so I won’t give it a try.\" You haven’t experienced the full Gintama adventure without reading the original manga, my friends. pss. I bet most of you were like \"tl;dr.\" Then, just read the manga itself; it’s more worth your time.]\n        "},

The story doesn't even make any sense.\nArt: 4/10 - Decent\nNothing special about the art. It isn't great, it isn't bad. Truly a purgatory of art. When a character vomits, it is censored.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="          \n    *This review was originally for Bankara and has consequently been merged into Gintama*\nA Spirited Youth does not perish so easily (Hans Carosa)\nSorachi Factory proudly presents yet another great magna filled with crazy humor, good action and a great cast.\nPLOT:\nCrazy Youth, a school full of delinquents, sci-fi era, great characters doing weird stuff, adult jokes, puns thrown at other series, and a comedy that conveys a serious but amazing message. If anyone can make a great dish out of these ingredients, it has to be the legendary Ape Man (Sorachi Sensei).\nBankara is a rebellion against a society where the grownups that don’t fear the change that\n          \n        youngsters can bring in the society, deprive those youngsters from their spring time of youths. The youth can only benefit if they follow their grownups but the social order doesn’t play fair. If you want someone to follow you, you have to lead them by example and not by putting chains around their neck. It is a fight against such adults who try to turn the youth into their pet dogs and a story of a hero who wages war against them.\nYouth is an enigmatic yet charismatic time of our lives. Sorachi has highlighted the significance and beauty of this golden time and conveyed the message that the youth which believes in efforts to reach their dreams, friendship and trust in each other, will never go wrong. The usage of some mind-blowing quotes really makes it an exciting read.\nCHARACTERS:\nFor a oneshot, Bankara has got one hell of a characterization. Especially the two lead characters are nothing short of superb.\nThe character of Gouda Takeru is something to watch out for. Sorachi has portrayed him as a true leader. Someone who doesn’t make people follow him with force but with his care and affection, Someone who is ready to protect the thing which are precious to him and someone who is willing to bear all sins of others on his back.\nIn such short space, Sorachi has managed to show a great relation between the two leads. Connecting their pasts with their presents and turning their friendship in to something exciting to look out for.\nThe rest of the cast may not be something special but certainly not ignorable. Especially Gundam Sensei :P\nART:\nThe art is traditional Sorachi style, full of dialogues boxes, weird and funny faces made by the characters, and some cool and exciting action.\nTARGET AUDIENCE:\nBankara is for everyone who is in, haven’t reached or passed his/her spring time of youth i.e. from a 1 year old to a 100 year old. However the Gintama and Sorachi fans will like it more because they are used to his puns and sarcastic style.\nTIPS:\n    * Since it contains extra amount of text in it, try not to rush it and read it slowly.\n    * Listen to the song \"Sailor-Fuku\" after reading this chapter. It is an 80’s era song. It will make you smile :D\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="            \n    Gintama is a very unique (and odd) manga, but very captivating.\nSTORY:\nGintama doesn't really have a direction or course. It's like Doraemon, an adventure a day. But it is far more interesting. Sorachi-sensei gives hints of mysterious pasts, heavy under plots, and the like, but so far, he hasn't tackled fully any of those yet.\nThe basic format of this one is: everyday adventure, then exciting arc that gives some hint/quick peek of Gin's past or anything serious, then back to everyday adventure, and so on. Actually, this cycle would leave you wanting for more, and will make you crave for the next chapter.\nART:\nregular shonen jump manga\n          \n        art. Not much toning, but it's still awesome. The fight scenes are understandable. There are a lot of close-up panels, which I find nice since it shows the expression/emotion clearly (plus, it adds to the effectiveness of the lines/words). One thing to point out, however, is that it is a bit wordy (too big speech bubbles), but you'll have to forgive Sorachi-sensei with this one, since Jump only gives 20 pages for a chapter. Either than that, it's good.\nCHARACTER:\nAMAZING and UNIQUE characters.\nOne thing that'll get you hooked into this manga is the presence of unusual (and weird) characters. I'm not talking appearance, but their personality. There is a kaboom of far-from-average people in this one.\nHowever, despite them being not your ordinary characters, you'll still get attached with them as they have the human side that will make you sympathize with them.\nOne thing notable with Sorachi-sensei is his use of weird personalities to bring out the human in them. This is the first time I have ever seen this style before. Each and everyone of them has their own life, way of thinking, and principles that show what kind of soul they have (the main theme of the manga --as much as I can see).\nENJOYMENT:\nThis one I give Gintama 100% times infinity!\nWhat's really captivating in this manga is the humor and the witty responses present. They're all unexpected (trust me.)\nSorachi-sensei has great humor. He uses a lot of puns on words (making a lot of translators whine) just as the title itself (\"gintama\" (gin's soul/ silver soul) almost like \"kintama\" (testicles)). With this, you can now deduce  that some of the jokes toe the line a bit, and this makes Gintama a lot more interesting. Sorachi-sensei has a way with words, and his choice of words are really quite remarkable. (This explains the big speech bubbles).\nNot once have I found a part corny or dull.\nOverall, I'd totally recommend this one. I'm not a fan of light-plotted mangas or stories with no direction, but this totally is an exception.\nYou're not going to be after the story itself, you're going to be after the satisfaction it gives you while you read it. What you're going to look forward to is the script, the reaction, the turn of events, and the way this wacky world will turn out to be.\nThank you for reading my review, and I hope this gives help.\nOh, and one more advice:\nif you're gonna watch the anime, READ THE MANGA FIRST!\nThere are a lot of edits in the anime for a lot of reasons, and it ruins the witty jokes of the manga, making it corny --believe me.\n        "},

I watched the first three episodes, then decided to skip a hundred episodes, then skip a hundred more, then decided to abandon it. . . . making a V-line for the manga adaptation, and now I have to say that was probably the smartest random thing I've ever decided to do. Besides the art which I gave a 9/10, everything else is all tens. . . which is rare. Extremely rare. What\n          \n        the hell, this is the only thing on MAL I almost gave all tens to.\n-\nThe story. . . well, it's pretty much a slice-of-life manga. To put it extremely, extremely, very, super duper, ohmahgod-a-whole-lot, unspecifically. Despite knowing this will result in a failed attempt, let me try to be more detailed- \nBecause the main characters, Gintoki & Co., are mostly missing a few screws, they have quite a. . . fun life. I don't remember exactly what Gintoki said, but it was along the lines of having a short, good life is better then having a long, boring one, which I must agree with, although I'm not doing anything to stop my life from being a long boring one. . . .\nAnyway, before I get off topic-\nThe whole series so far is basically a whole bunch of separate arcs that are oddly connected in which either the main characters or supporting characters get into a bit of a tumble. Some of the stories can actually be sad (but that doesn't stop at least one of the characters from making a dirty joke) but most of them are outrageous. . . in an outrageously good way. How outrageously outrageous indeed.  Outrageously outrageous oranges or outrageously outrageous orangutans? Or. . wait what.  Uhh. . . . *scratches head* \nOh.\nAnyway, most of them are like one big joke- you can take half of it and it would still be okay, but it wouldn't be as funny as if you read the whole thing. It's like how eating one chip is okay, but one piece of chip is nothing compared to the whole bag. Before I get off topic again, let's head start talking about the art.\n-\nThe art was great. Splendid. Perfect. Whatever teachers tell parents about their children. Hooowever. . . it wasn't my type of thing. While the art was detailed and the characters all looked nice, to be honest, at first, i got some of the characters mixed up. plis nuh haet. Anyway, the art was just fine as it is- i didn't even hate it. It just wasn't the type of art i liked the most. \n-\nNow characters.\nWeeeeellll. . . .\nThey're . . . unique, to be bland. To be more precise, I'd say they're probably my favorite sets of characters ever- even the supporting ones. The only reason you don't see any of the characters from Gintama on my favorite character list is because I can't fit all of them there, and sooner or later I'll start a mental conflict on which Gintama characters should be up there and I'd go insane. \nI also love how, despite how seemingly goofy this manga is (not that i'm denying it) there are actually moments where the characters get serious and that is some serious character development as far as i can tell. In addition, in those moments when they do get serious, Sorachi Hideaki already has a uncommon but nonetheless superior and commendable setting placed. \nAlso, you can not disprove of every character in Gintama. You will at least find a handful that you feel you can not stay away from. If you refuse to agree with me, I refuse to believe your being honest. \n-\nEnjoyment? Do you really need me to spell it out for you? Okay, fine then. Allow myself to bring a time machine and travel back to the past, allll the way to first grade. . . .\n. . . .\n\"Alright children, how do we spell ten?\" \n\"T-E-N! TEN!\"\n. . . .\n*fast forwards back to the current time, whenever that is*\nSo basically, this manga is a ten out of ten. It doesn't matter if your starting on random volumes like I did (I went from vol. 15 to vol 6. to vol. 1. to 10 to 11, 12, 13, 24, 16, 15, 21, 22, 20. . . and etc. . .I do this alot.) you will STiLL find yourself loving Gintama. As it's a slice of life manga, you can pretty much read in whatever order  you want to and it'll be fine, although you might get confused occasionally. *Looks away innocently and whistles*"},

Witty and well-written. \nIt's episodic, mostly, but has that awesome story of Gintama's past running through the entire thing (and I actually wish the mangaka would focus more on that because it's fascinating and the best arcs are always the ones that elaborate his past a little more).  Super funny and great use of gags.  There's even like four chapters devoted to people getting trapped on the toilet without toilet paper!  HAHAHA!  It was ingenious.  Although this manga deals with samurai and shinsengumi and aliens and other mythical creatures, it's so refreshing and honestly AWESOME to throw all of\n          \n        those characters into a situation as seemingly trivial and mundane as getting stuck on the toilet without paper.  \nSuper funny and all the characters are so damn likable. Gintoki and Hijikata are my faves, but I love the whole crew.  Some characters are definitely better developed than others, but with the series being as long as it is now, the mangaka has had time to flesh out these characters.  Actually some of my favorite arcs revolve around the supporting characters.  The Madao arc and Mitsuba arc come to mind.  Both of those arcs made me CRY!  In a gag manga!  WHAT.  \nI think some people may be put off by the episodic nature of the manga and the fact that it can get so random, but this is a gag manga at heart.  And the gags are usually really funny and I love them!  But despite me saying this, the absolute best stories to me are the more serious arcs.  Benizakura is still my favorite, although the Yoshiwara arc comes very close cause we get Tsukuyo and Kagura/Kamui.  The current arc regarding the corrupt Shogun Sadasada is soooooooooo good.  I love when Gintama gets serious! \nVery enjoyable series and one I always look forward to reading.  (The anime is also fantastic.  Great voice acting!!!)\n        "},

It's really amazing to read something makes fun on Ashita no Joe and Hajime no ippo in the same time as example and this's what's make it great.\nStory : Some people think that Gintama it doesn't have any story they are just mocks people and make fun on another Manga or Tvs programmes..., but it's not true. As I said the manga is based on true facts and periods in Japan's history, and I can said based on what I read the author refer the Amanto and the first invasion of the Edo to the time When commodore Matthew C. Perry's four-ship squadron appeared in Edo Bay in July 1853 and what's called 'End of seclusion', that's what makes Gintama great it's based on Japan history in a comic way, and the author as I think he's try to presenting another view of this period.\nIn these last two years from the Shogun Assassination Arc and the manga but the comedia and parody aside, and go with the main story of the Manga deeply.\nArt : It's really awesome and I fond it Improved from chapter to another, It's good in drawing of shapes, identikit, effects but ine the most part the background being empty and you can't recognise if it's night or day.\nCharacter : When I talked about the Gintama touch I meant the Characters too, I think and as I saw there's just one detested Character is Tokugawa Sada Sada in the whole story even the villains you will love them, like Utsuro, Oboro or Hitotsubashi Nobu Nobu in the last, also you can't pickup your favorite charachter here when you will read this manga you will like them all because each one of them will make you smile and happy.\nSakata Gintoki is the main character and it's based on Kintarō (Sakata no Kintoki) a folk hero from Japanese folklore. \nHere are some characters and what's they based on? :\nTakasugi Shinsuke is a friend to Gintoli and he is the leader Kiheitai he's based on Takasugi Shinsaku the real Kiheitai leader who found it to fight against Bakufu for revenge to his teacher Yoshida Shoin (who is Yoshida Shouyou in the Manga) and his action lead to Meiji Restoration.\nKatsura Kotarou the most funny and crazy character in the manga and he's based on Kido Takayoshi.\nEnjoyment : There's nothing here to say more than Gintama is really meant it.\nI don't think that you will wast your time in reading this Manga at all.\n        "},
