    Ah, Gintama. One of the best and most complete current manga in Jump. Its premise is intriguing and unique (aliens in historical Japan? Who would have thought it?). It has great characters--ranging from the diabetic lazy samurai Gintoki to the samurai who has a mayo addiction Hijikata to the stalker ninja Sa-chan and so on. All of them blend together well without feeling out of place and flat. No matter where Sorachi puts them in, they always get at least one huge guffaw from me. Its brand of comedy doesn't consist only of repetitive and sometimes obscure references, but it's also a very satirical commentary\
          \
        on Japanese society reflected in feudal Edo. Though Gintama is first and foremost a gag manga, with all chapters merely snippets of the Yorozuya's different interactions with themselves and other people in the Amanto (Gintama's term for aliens)-filled Edo, Sorachi Hideaki manages to slip in a few serious action arcs to show a little semblance of an actual plot. And when he does, he brings his A-game. All serious arcs in Gintama are great, they either keep you on the edge of your seat eagerly anticipating what happens next or reduce you to a bawling little girl with every sudden sad twist. Sorachi Hideaki definitely is a master at balancing hearty laughs with testosterone-laden action and heartwarming drama without it feeling shoehorned in to the story. Gintama is already an awesome manga but it could use an improvement in the art department. Don't get me wrong, I'm no art connossieur, but sometimes the characters look stiff and hastily done but other than that there really is nothing to complain about. Comedy and action rarely mix together well, but in Gintama it does perfectly. With well-written storylines and almost uncanny comedic sense, Sorachi Hideaki's Gintama should not disappoint. GO. READ. IT. NOW.\

    \"At its heart Gintama is a science fiction human pseudo-historical comedy. The bottom line is that this is a nonsense manga. But I don't believe in telling readers what to think, so read it any way you like.\" - Hideaki Sorachi.\
Gintama is a fantastically creative work with an endless appeal; as consistent, funny and compelling now as it was five years ago.\
The story - for the most part - is told in a rather episodic fashion, with each chapter presenting a different plot. These chapters are largely comedic and follow the huge cast finding themselves in all sorts of hilarious situations. Hideaki Sorachi - the\
          \
        author - makes use of many ingenious gags and plot devices to avoid repetition, and also explores a variety of story arcs which add a sense of heightened drama to an otherwise predominantly humourous series. The story arcs expand on the characters in a way the stand-alone chapters cannot, and add more variety and narrative to the series. Certain chapters are better than others, but Sorachi rarely falters - he keeps up the momentum after all these years and still manages to present consistently brilliant stories, ideas, characters and concepts.\
Sorachi rarely uses any sketchy effects in his artwork, nor does he display much shading. His lines are very bold and he almost never makes use of double page spreads. Gintama, however, does not require such extravagance. It is a fairly dialogue-heavy manga and while it does contain action, it is a predominantly comedic series. Sorachi pays close attention to panel placement and timing to best communicate his comedy to the reader. Artwork is half that communication, however, and Sorachi never misses the mark. His artwork has steadily improved since the series' inception and his character designs are a real stand-out element.\
Over the years, Sorachi has built up a phenomenally large supporting cast, along with three unforgettable main characters. Some supporting members have almost become as integral as the main cast itself, with Sorachi making sure no-one goes amiss; he frequently uses his supporting characters no matter how minor to the story they may be. Certain characters are more well-rounded than others, but such is the nature of a gag-based series; Gintama's characters needn't be intricate, complex beings. The story arcs greatly expand on the cast, however, adding background and a soul to characters otherwise present solely for comedic relief, all the while opening up new directors and opportunities for them to take.\
The comedy in Gintama has a fantastic range; from toilet humour to meticulously executed gags to parodies of popular culture, both Japanese and Western. The series displays a rich assortment of genres and a full embrace of its fanatical setting; creativity and imagination run wild. Despite being a predominantly comedic series, Gintama has so much more to offer; in its characters, its setting, its sheer originality and inventiveness - it's a manga that keeps on giving and one not to be missed.\

    *This review was originally for Bankara and has consequently been merged into Gintama*\
This a one shot, that was like been written like one, so I will try to be fast.\
Bankara is a parody of the society, and some other things, written from one my favorites mangakas Sorachi Hideaki. It talk about the way that our world is walking on and \"growth\" on. It's a society with many problems, more of them even the people don`t really understanding them. Most of the people are trying to find there way to the freedom, delinquents often are being seen like that. In this manga they are like the\
          \
        stupid rebels, the normal students are like the people of the grown society and someone, our girl, have the mission to protect the morals, the law and the peace of this society, but even she don`t really understand it, she is just force to do it. In society like that come someone like our hero. He is coming from the past, actually from a society with almost the same problems, they just become even bigger with the time. But even then he could become what he is... He is no really so great man, that is doing revolution to change the world or something like that... No, no... He is simple destroying with brutal strength. He is destroying everything that he one of this bullshits. And this is written to us, the young people, because we are the future and he want to tell us to stop believing in the hypocrisy of out society and to brake out of it's prison when our senses of real freedom (if we really one to call this freedom) are the best.\
P.S. Sorry for my poor writing skills on this language, and of course you always have the right to think about me like an idiot, because i believe that this manga is actually good. But you are human too, therefore you are an idiot too.\

Story:\
It's from the creator of Gintama,  Hideaki Sorachi so you would expect some ridiculous slapstick humour, action and even a bit of drama, this one shot definitely delivers in  aspects in even with its length. This could have even worked as an episode of Gintama. Despite being a One Shot, it manages to make a the story interesting enough, although it does help you appreciate it more if you're already a  fan of Gintama since it would be easier for you to \"get\" the humour.\
Art:\
There isn't anything about the art\
          \
        that can be considered outstanding, still the overall quality of it is decent. The character design and art is mostly simplistic but it has it's own charm.\
Characters:\
Given that this was a One Shot it hardly left any room for character development but it did manage to make the two central characters interesting enough.\
Overall:\
I felt that it could have fleshed out the story a bit more with a few more pages of Golgo's hilarious attempts to assassinate Fujieda but all in all it was enjoyable for what it was, definitely worth the read if you're a fan of Gintama/Sorachi or just looking for a short comedy/action manga to read \

    Who doesn’t enjoy reading idioms and puns almost every other manga window? Granted that you also don’t mind some fun jokes tossed in your direction, I’m pretty sure that you’re going to be satisfied with this series. One can be sure to say that resistance to at least some laughing is purely futile in this series. From chapter one, I cannot say that I have not at least laughed less than perhaps 50seconds to almost every single chapter. Maybe it’s just me that is often easily amused, but this series is anything but commonplace, dull, or morose.\
Revolving around the last reigns of the samurai era,\
          \
        we are introduced to this new sort of Edo, Japan and world. It is one that includes co-existence with \"aliens,\" also known as Amanto. The main protagonists make encounters with those who are trying to live their life the way the want to and can, those who are trying to protect the current way of living, and those who want to remove the current situation and return back to traditional ways of life. It’s as though there’s a new sort of \"bureaucracy\" running amok now that aliens are trying to change lifestyles on the Earth. And so, the story embarks on the many adventures and confrontations that this main characters’ team strikes upon. Beginning from little side, freelance jobs that the team accepts from others to major battles against revolutionists that the team fights for others, the characters and stories develop and change with inclusions of comedy and drama.\
The most important aspects that struck my interest were probably the insanely funny moments and expressions put into this series. From chapter to chapter there is some insertion of some sort of theme of fun and/or comedy. And yet, don’t get me wrong; this isn’t entirely something just for laughs. The drama incorporated into this brilliantly devised series is fascinating to read as well. At times, however, one may ponder, \"wait, how was this relevant to anything?\" That’s the thing. The story is like a maelstrom of randomosity and episodicity. In other words, I’d say that the audience is flung into this mess of small arcs and \"filler-like\" sequences/storylines and well, into random new \"alternate universes,\" too. Additionally, the story generally has fairly dreadful transitions; you’re hopping from one story to the next basically after each \"mini-arc;\" and some times, you may just get altogether confused, perplexed and even angry by the all the hysteria. Moreover, there’s always a tinge of \"predictability\" in what will surely happen. As unappealing as that may sound, it’s actually still amazingly fun to read. Although the ridiculousness of this series is incredible, I don’t believe that I wasted any of my time experiencing any of it. I thoroughly enjoyed myself just reading about random \"philosophies\" and so-called \"life lessons\" from the stories involved in this series. Then even though the small arcs and \"real\" storylines that the mangaka does work around are actually very intriguing and exciting to read more about, I can’t suppress my anticipation for more of the \"main\" storyline to continue forward.\
Regardless, I believe that the elements of adventure, comedy, drama, suspense, thrill, and tragedy are all thoroughly integrated into this story even if it may seem too randomized and episodic. Nothing is tremendously wrong with something that doesn’t dive straight into a detailed and convoluted or direct and simplistic plotline. One should just appreciate the hearty comedy that is fed directly to him, honestly. Maybe I’m being too obsessive when I say that? Nah, I won’t deny the fact that there have been a couple chapters where I was like, to the mangaka, \"Um, Sorachi-sensei, why did you even bother writing and drawing about such plainness?\" For example, there have been a couple chapters regarding completely irrelevant topics to the manga story or main characters. But, c’mon really? I still laughed my head off and enjoyed the read thoroughly because of its insight and hilarity. Altogether, the stories that this mangaka expresses and illustrates are of great ingenuity and practicality. Wait, did you catch that? Yes, I did say practicality because, to say the least, I felt like I’ve learned more (about life and its whims) from this series than from all of my exposure and experiences with other anime and manga. Even so, if you’re thinking that there’s still no point of reading something without a solid plotline, you’re mistaken. This is a series that’s perhaps going to inspire you to think about certain matters differently. And, hey, I think that’s an admirable feat and offering to an audience. Thus, don’t feel like it’s going to be an entire waste of your time on this series.\
Anyway, let’s move onto another significant factor (maybe not the best \"number two\" evaluation tool but whatever) when one decides to read manga… The art. Now, this is not at all an issue. I actually find the art-style more unique and clean than most other styles. This isn’t your \"typical\" Shounen Jump art or something full of GAR-like characters. [[Then again, what’s qualified as \"typical,\" eh?]] This has a great mixture of almost shoujo-like but still shounen-like artistry. Furthermore, the background designs and incorporations of other illustrates besides character designs are very neat and pretty to view. Yet, I can’t say that this series contains the best art ever because it really isn’t the best of the best. Even so, I believe that the imagery and scenery are both illustrated in extremely appropriate methods and styles. There have been a few characters and some random usages of crazy-looking characters but it just adds to the overall hilarity of the story itself. Furthermore, some characterizations and portrayals are probably done for further amusement. I did indeed get some great laughs from some fun character insertions Sorachi provided. Then, the way and style of which he was able to draw out action scenes and also \"thriller-scenes\" and then \"emotional scenes,\" and well every other \"dramatized\" scene were altogether masterful and skillful. Moreover, the flow of scenes in each story was further emphasized and clearly offered to the audience; never was anything too abrupt or confusing. Everything about the art did help add to my enjoyment of this series. In conclusion, the art proved to be impressive and helpful to move the story and interest forward.\
Thirdly, about the characters and their personalities… To be honest, I don’t think that there’s a single character that just annoys me to an extremity; and I believe that is important for some who think that a single character can ruin a story. The personalities really do grow on you in spite of the fact that there some initially slightly bothersome persona out in the series… Then again, you can’t really blame people to act certain ways because it’s just in their particular nature to do so… A person can only be so nice and only be so mean? Meh, I’m not trying to say that everyone is perfectly likable at the first introduction; since, you’ve got your typical weak main character who strives to become stronger and then, your fairly strong character that’s always winning fights, then you’ve got your typical random jokers and clowns around, too. Even so, you grow to understand why these characters are these ways and well, at least for me, learn to appreciate each and everyone's existence. The development of these characters is fairly random, but, Sorachi does take the time to give each character almost realistic personality and spirit. All characters also take the opportunity to actually learn and feel from certain experiences that are essentially important to real life as well. Furthermore, no one is extremely dull or boring to further read about. After certain characters are introduced, I personally felt an urge to find out more about that one person. There were a couple folks that didn’t get much of a huge spotlight as well as some who got too much \"camera-time.\" Nevertheless, I thought everyone was generally described and portrayed in a more or less distributive and fair way. As with most series, once you’ve laid your eyes on one particular character, you’re almost guaranteed that you will enjoy the descriptions and details entailing that character because of the elaborations and creativity of the plot as well.\
Finally, the enjoyment factor. Although this series is random as much whatever else random series you’ve probably read/watched before, I have to say that this can deliver greater and heartier laughs. There are also a few of times where you can also shed a tear or two in this series, thus you’re not just enjoying the whirlwind of ridiculousness 24/7. The drama and suspense entanglement also draws one into the series since there are sometimes \"cliffhangers\" that you just are at a point where you’re struggling to know more. The characters themselves are also eventually lovable as before mentioned. Then, the philosophies and puns spun in every direction towards you are also just exciting and amusing to read. All in all, even with the extreme randomness, the series has practically every element to a so-called \"great story\" that is possible; with substance or not, this story never ceases to entertain the audience in one way or another.\
Lastly, although this sounds like a bunch of tedious ramblings, I do hope that you, whoever, reads this, do give this manga a try. By no means am I saying that this is the most perfect manga ever because it still rivals against a lot of greater epics, but this is a grand treasure chest in the ocean of manga. It’s yet another classic series that deserves more credit than it’s granted. And wouldn’t you want another series \"just for laughs?\" [ps. I know that this \"just for laughs\" phrase has a copyright, hence the quote marks. Also, don’t you go thinking, \"Oh, the anime was only so-so, so I won’t give it a try.\" You haven’t experienced the full Gintama adventure without reading the original manga, my friends. pss. I bet most of you were like \"tl;dr.\" Then, just read the manga itself; it’s more worth your time.]\

Story: 3/10 - Poor\
Not really a great story here. Very shallow, and rather immature. I found nothing original about the story, or captivating. None of the characters are developed, you feel none of their feelings, nothing. The story doesn't even make any sense.\
Art: 4/10 - Decent\
Nothing special about the art. It isn't great, it isn't bad. Truly a purgatory of art. When a character vomits, it is censored. I don't really see how that is worth censoring. Pretty bad art, not appealing at all, and poor character designs to boot.\
Characters: 2/10 - Dreadful\
Stupid\
          \
        characters that don't make a lick of sense. You don't get attached to them, you don't feel their emotions - nothing. Some of the shallowest characters I have ever encountered, and hope to encounter, in my entire life. They are also drawn poorly too and have a bad character design.\
Enjoyment: 1/10 - Pathetic\
I didn't enjoy this manga, if you didn't notice that by now. 'Nuff said.\
Overall: 2/10 - Dreadful\
Do not read this manga if you value your time. It is a complete and utter waste of time. Try doing something more enjoyable - like slamming your hand in a door really hard or getting your foot run over by a car.\

A Spirited Youth does not perish so easily (Hans Carosa)\
Sorachi Factory proudly presents yet another great magna filled with crazy humor, good action and a great cast.\
PLOT:\
Crazy Youth, a school full of delinquents, sci-fi era, great characters doing weird stuff, adult jokes, puns thrown at other series, and a comedy that conveys a serious but amazing message. If anyone can make a great dish out of these ingredients, it has to be the legendary Ape Man (Sorachi Sensei).\
Bankara is a rebellion against a society where the grownups that don’t fear the change that\
          \
        youngsters can bring in the society, deprive those youngsters from their spring time of youths. The youth can only benefit if they follow their grownups but the social order doesn’t play fair. If you want someone to follow you, you have to lead them by example and not by putting chains around their neck. It is a fight against such adults who try to turn the youth into their pet dogs and a story of a hero who wages war against them.\
Youth is an enigmatic yet charismatic time of our lives. Sorachi has highlighted the significance and beauty of this golden time and conveyed the message that the youth which believes in efforts to reach their dreams, friendship and trust in each other, will never go wrong. The usage of some mind-blowing quotes really makes it an exciting read.\
CHARACTERS:\
For a oneshot, Bankara has got one hell of a characterization. Especially the two lead characters are nothing short of superb.\
The character of Gouda Takeru is something to watch out for. Sorachi has portrayed him as a true leader. Someone who doesn’t make people follow him with force but with his care and affection, Someone who is ready to protect the thing which are precious to him and someone who is willing to bear all sins of others on his back.\
In such short space, Sorachi has managed to show a great relation between the two leads. Connecting their pasts with their presents and turning their friendship in to something exciting to look out for.\
The rest of the cast may not be something special but certainly not ignorable. Especially Gundam Sensei :P\
ART:\
The art is traditional Sorachi style, full of dialogues boxes, weird and funny faces made by the characters, and some cool and exciting action.\
TARGET AUDIENCE:\
Bankara is for everyone who is in, haven’t reached or passed his/her spring time of youth i.e. from a 1 year old to a 100 year old. However the Gintama and Sorachi fans will like it more because they are used to his puns and sarcastic style.\
TIPS:\
    * Since it contains extra amount of text in it, try not to rush it and read it slowly.\
    * Listen to the song \"Sailor-Fuku\" after reading this chapter. It is an 80’s era song. It will make you smile :D\

    Gintama is a very unique (and odd) manga, but very captivating.\
STORY:\
Gintama doesn't really have a direction or course. It's like Doraemon, an adventure a day. But it is far more interesting. Sorachi-sensei gives hints of mysterious pasts, heavy under plots, and the like, but so far, he hasn't tackled fully any of those yet.\
The basic format of this one is: everyday adventure, then exciting arc that gives some hint/quick peek of Gin's past or anything serious, then back to everyday adventure, and so on. Actually, this cycle would leave you wanting for more, and will make you crave for the next chapter.\
ART:\
regular shonen jump manga\
          \
        art. Not much toning, but it's still awesome. The fight scenes are understandable. There are a lot of close-up panels, which I find nice since it shows the expression/emotion clearly (plus, it adds to the effectiveness of the lines/words). One thing to point out, however, is that it is a bit wordy (too big speech bubbles), but you'll have to forgive Sorachi-sensei with this one, since Jump only gives 20 pages for a chapter. Either than that, it's good.\
CHARACTER:\
AMAZING and UNIQUE characters.\
One thing that'll get you hooked into this manga is the presence of unusual (and weird) characters. I'm not talking appearance, but their personality. There is a kaboom of far-from-average people in this one.\
However, despite them being not your ordinary characters, you'll still get attached with them as they have the human side that will make you sympathize with them.\
One thing notable with Sorachi-sensei is his use of weird personalities to bring out the human in them. This is the first time I have ever seen this style before. Each and everyone of them has their own life, way of thinking, and principles that show what kind of soul they have (the main theme of the manga --as much as I can see).\
ENJOYMENT:\
This one I give Gintama 100% times infinity!\
What's really captivating in this manga is the humor and the witty responses present. They're all unexpected (trust me.)\
Sorachi-sensei has great humor. He uses a lot of puns on words (making a lot of translators whine) just as the title itself (\"gintama\" (gin's soul/ silver soul) almost like \"kintama\" (testicles)). With this, you can now deduce  that some of the jokes toe the line a bit, and this makes Gintama a lot more interesting. Sorachi-sensei has a way with words, and his choice of words are really quite remarkable. (This explains the big speech bubbles).\
Not once have I found a part corny or dull.\
Overall, I'd totally recommend this one. I'm not a fan of light-plotted mangas or stories with no direction, but this totally is an exception.\
You're not going to be after the story itself, you're going to be after the satisfaction it gives you while you read it. What you're going to look forward to is the script, the reaction, the turn of events, and the way this wacky world will turn out to be.\
Thank you for reading my review, and I hope this gives help.\
Oh, and one more advice:\
if you're gonna watch the anime, READ THE MANGA FIRST!\
There are a lot of edits in the anime for a lot of reasons, and it ruins the witty jokes of the manga, making it corny --believe me.\

    \"One of the best mangas you will ever find in mangaland.\" - Shintako Inari.\
Alright, I'll be honest- I kind of. . . didn't like the anime, so I ditched it for the manga. I watched the first three episodes, then decided to skip a hundred episodes, then skip a hundred more, then decided to abandon it. . . . making a V-line for the manga adaptation, and now I have to say that was probably the smartest random thing I've ever decided to do. Besides the art which I gave a 9/10, everything else is all tens. . . which is rare. Extremely rare. What\
          \
        the hell, this is the only thing on MAL I almost gave all tens to.\
-\
The story. . . well, it's pretty much a slice-of-life manga. To put it extremely, extremely, very, super duper, ohmahgod-a-whole-lot, unspecifically. Despite knowing this will result in a failed attempt, let me try to be more detailed- \
Because the main characters, Gintoki & Co., are mostly missing a few screws, they have quite a. . . fun life. I don't remember exactly what Gintoki said, but it was along the lines of having a short, good life is better then having a long, boring one, which I must agree with, although I'm not doing anything to stop my life from being a long boring one. . . .\
Anyway, before I get off topic-\
The whole series so far is basically a whole bunch of separate arcs that are oddly connected in which either the main characters or supporting characters get into a bit of a tumble. Some of the stories can actually be sad (but that doesn't stop at least one of the characters from making a dirty joke) but most of them are outrageous. . . in an outrageously good way. How outrageously outrageous indeed.  Outrageously outrageous oranges or outrageously outrageous orangutans? Or. . wait what.  Uhh. . . . *scratches head* \
Oh.\
Anyway, most of them are like one big joke- you can take half of it and it would still be okay, but it wouldn't be as funny as if you read the whole thing. It's like how eating one chip is okay, but one piece of chip is nothing compared to the whole bag. Before I get off topic again, let's head start talking about the art.\
-\
The art was great. Splendid. Perfect. Whatever teachers tell parents about their children. Hooowever. . . it wasn't my type of thing. While the art was detailed and the characters all looked nice, to be honest, at first, i got some of the characters mixed up. plis nuh haet. Anyway, the art was just fine as it is- i didn't even hate it. It just wasn't the type of art i liked the most. \
-\
Now characters.\
Weeeeellll. . . .\
They're . . . unique, to be bland. To be more precise, I'd say they're probably my favorite sets of characters ever- even the supporting ones. The only reason you don't see any of the characters from Gintama on my favorite character list is because I can't fit all of them there, and sooner or later I'll start a mental conflict on which Gintama characters should be up there and I'd go insane. \
I also love how, despite how seemingly goofy this manga is (not that i'm denying it) there are actually moments where the characters get serious and that is some serious character development as far as i can tell. In addition, in those moments when they do get serious, Sorachi Hideaki already has a uncommon but nonetheless superior and commendable setting placed. \
Also, you can not disprove of every character in Gintama. You will at least find a handful that you feel you can not stay away from. If you refuse to agree with me, I refuse to believe your being honest. \
-\
Enjoyment? Do you really need me to spell it out for you? Okay, fine then. Allow myself to bring a time machine and travel back to the past, allll the way to first grade. . . .\
. . . .\
\"Alright children, how do we spell ten?\" \
\"T-E-N! TEN!\"\
. . . .\
*fast forwards back to the current time, whenever that is*\
So basically, this manga is a ten out of ten. It doesn't matter if your starting on random volumes like I did (I went from vol. 15 to vol 6. to vol. 1. to 10 to 11, 12, 13, 24, 16, 15, 21, 22, 20. . . and etc. . .I do this alot.) you will STiLL find yourself loving Gintama. As it's a slice of life manga, you can pretty much read in whatever order  you want to and it'll be fine, although you might get confused occasionally. *Looks away innocently and whistles*",

    HILARIOUS. Witty and well-written. \
It's episodic, mostly, but has that awesome story of Gintama's past running through the entire thing (and I actually wish the mangaka would focus more on that because it's fascinating and the best arcs are always the ones that elaborate his past a little more).  Super funny and great use of gags.  There's even like four chapters devoted to people getting trapped on the toilet without toilet paper!  HAHAHA!  It was ingenious.  Although this manga deals with samurai and shinsengumi and aliens and other mythical creatures, it's so refreshing and honestly AWESOME to throw all of\
          \
        those characters into a situation as seemingly trivial and mundane as getting stuck on the toilet without paper.  \
Super funny and all the characters are so damn likable. Gintoki and Hijikata are my faves, but I love the whole crew.  Some characters are definitely better developed than others, but with the series being as long as it is now, the mangaka has had time to flesh out these characters.  Actually some of my favorite arcs revolve around the supporting characters.  The Madao arc and Mitsuba arc come to mind.  Both of those arcs made me CRY!  In a gag manga!  WHAT.  \
I think some people may be put off by the episodic nature of the manga and the fact that it can get so random, but this is a gag manga at heart.  And the gags are usually really funny and I love them!  But despite me saying this, the absolute best stories to me are the more serious arcs.  Benizakura is still my favorite, although the Yoshiwara arc comes very close cause we get Tsukuyo and Kagura/Kamui.  The current arc regarding the corrupt Shogun Sadasada is soooooooooo good.  I love when Gintama gets serious! \
Very enjoyable series and one I always look forward to reading.  (The anime is also fantastic.  Great voice acting!!!)\

A one shot from the creator of Gintama, which is one of my all time favs, 13 was a great short read. Basically, a boy falls in love with a shy girl, tries to befriend her but instead majorly insults her. But the twist is that she comes from a family of assassins. Fast-forward to high school, the girl returns for her revenge. \
The art was good, it was similar to Gintama with simple lines to the characters faces. I liked how they approached 13, the main characters perspective, as  a narrative.\
          \
        They managed to develop the characters despite it being a one shot, which was impressive. Overall, it was a pretty good read.\

    Gintama is like a toilet seat. \
(I don't know if this applies to women.... please tell me...)\
When you want to take a dump, where do you want to do it? \
Most likely at home right? Where your ass is already used to the shape of the toilet seat and it just... you can't explain it but.....\
it just feels right.\
I mean, when you use the schools toilet or anyone else's toilet, it just feels weird and even uncomfortable.\
When you get used to the toilet seat though(most likely not because you aren't going to be shitting that much) it's going to feel great. \
Like your home toilet\
          \
        seat, you can sit on it for almost an unlimited amount of time, and its just going to start feeling right again.\
The same logic applies to Gintama. People never take the time to get used to it's weirdness, but once they do get comfortable and accept it, you'll have almost nothing that can compare to it. You'll be able to watch/read Gintama practically forever and not get bored of it, because the characters are very unique and fun. \
If no one feels this analogy, I'm probably just weird.... I would just replace everything with farts and apply the logic.\
 I wrote a long Gintama review but it got deleted, but if I find it, it'll most likely be on my profile or posted sometime in the future when I add more to it. \
I'll be on my toilet if anyone needs me.\

This is the first time I've completed reading a manga,so here's my review. This manga is a typical love to die scenery story.When your reading It, Its kind of like love forces you the point of lashing out to your lover. In real life Its considered a more personal issue of action than by an action of not understanding somebody clearly.Also the author was the author that was for Gintama.The manga is a Oneshot. It has a very chill vibe when you read the 39 pages. It somewhat misunderstanding to situations on\
          \
        life, Just like in real life where you and somebody keep arguing on certain lively topics. I really loved in this manga was that the 2 main characters drawings/situations fit the story so clearly and That they stood out from the other characters in the story. What I really didn't like was the drawing style of the characters of the random supporting characters that were in the manga. They couldn't stand out like the regular main characters.\
I put the story at a 9 because It left a certain type of gap that the story has with the characters and the manga but couldt have had a dramatic ending. \
I put a 9 for the Art because It fitted greatly but not perfectly, I love the main characters but could't fit through the other characters.\
I even put a 9 for the Characters because they were great but didn't fill the gap or \"goal\" that I was expecting. I would love/wish for another reincarnation of this manga though.\
I Put a 10 for Enjoyment because you can enjoy all the sorts,styles,emotions, and competition events.\
 I put a 10 for Overrall because the manga looked nice but I'm hoping a anime series(or an OVA) and I'd still would love to see another one of these short stories but in a anime or longer manga format. \
 Lastly I can recommend to you guys that you can read this,hope you enjoy It .\

Story:(8/10)\
The author of this manga is the author of Gintama, so if you know Gintama,you should know that there's going to be ridiculous humour.If you're a fan of Gintama, you probaby like this manga.The story is just about a very weird love between Izayo Gorugo(the girl) and Mondo Fujieda(the boy).\
Art:(9/10)\
The art was Great!In the end,Mondo Fujieda look like Gin-chan from Gintama.And Izayo Gorugo look like Sarutobi Ayame from Gintama(only with black hair and definitely not a masochism!\
If you don't like Gintama,I don't think you will like this manga.\

    This seems like what would be produced by someone on crack and acid at the same time. Okay maybe not that crazy, but I'd say pretty close to it. At the same time, this manga is so loveable.\
 The three main characters, Gintoki, Shinpachi, and Kagura, are some of my favorite characters in any manga or anime because of their personalities and interactions with each other . And it's nice because it can be so weird yet still usually have some sort of storyline to it. Although there are some chapters that are just completely out of the rest of the story, they're still really\
          \
        funny and aren't like typical fillers that make you frustrated. \
The art is also worth mentioning because I found it nice to look at and the styling went well with the type of story being told.\

    Hmmm Gintama... I think I wil fell empty when this manga ends but I will still have a really good memories with it.\
I started with Anime and when I moved out to Manga in the first time it was so hard for me to read it there's a lot of words and fast dialogues, but slowly and step by step I fall in love with it and it has become the best Manga I read so far.\
The best thing in Gintama it's not the story that based on a critical period of Japan's history, between Edo period and the early of Meiji   period\
          \
        or the comedy or the characters even if a lot of them based on real people but the touch, the soul of Gintama, the Mangaka Sorachi Hideaki, has succeeded in making something unique, in this story you can lough a lot in the same time you can feel sad or crazy, It's not based on the fighting or comedy or parody but on the life and that's what make it special and unique, you can find what you need or seeking for, in this manga.\
A lot of time they making parody on more than one thing in the same time and this's what make it funny and hard to understand too, what they are doing? On whom they are mocks? And this's what make some people fond it not funny or they don't know what's going on? It's really amazing to read something makes fun on Ashita no Joe and Hajime no ippo in the same time as example and this's what's make it great.\
Story : Some people think that Gintama it doesn't have any story they are just mocks people and make fun on another Manga or Tvs programmes..., but it's not true. As I said the manga is based on true facts and periods in Japan's history, and I can said based on what I read the author refer the Amanto and the first invasion of the Edo to the time When commodore Matthew C. Perry's four-ship squadron appeared in Edo Bay in July 1853 and what's called 'End of seclusion', that's what makes Gintama great it's based on Japan history in a comic way, and the author as I think he's try to presenting another view of this period.\
In these last two years from the Shogun Assassination Arc and the manga but the comedia and parody aside, and go with the main story of the Manga deeply.\
Art : It's really awesome and I fond it Improved from chapter to another, It's good in drawing of shapes, identikit, effects but ine the most part the background being empty and you can't recognise if it's night or day.\
Character : When I talked about the Gintama touch I meant the Characters too, I think and as I saw there's just one detested Character is Tokugawa Sada Sada in the whole story even the villains you will love them, like Utsuro, Oboro or Hitotsubashi Nobu Nobu in the last, also you can't pickup your favorite charachter here when you will read this manga you will like them all because each one of them will make you smile and happy.\
Sakata Gintoki is the main character and it's based on Kintarō (Sakata no Kintoki) a folk hero from Japanese folklore. \
Here are some characters and what's they based on? :\
Takasugi Shinsuke is a friend to Gintoli and he is the leader Kiheitai he's based on Takasugi Shinsaku the real Kiheitai leader who found it to fight against Bakufu for revenge to his teacher Yoshida Shoin (who is Yoshida Shouyou in the Manga) and his action lead to Meiji Restoration.\
Katsura Kotarou the most funny and crazy character in the manga and he's based on Kido Takayoshi.\
Enjoyment : There's nothing here to say more than Gintama is really meant it.\
I don't think that you will wast your time in reading this Manga at all.\

 Kagura, meaning \"god-entertainment\" is a member of the Yorozuya alongside Sakata Gintoki and Shinpachi Shimura and the main female protagonist of Gintama.\
 \
 Although she appears to be a normal, cute, human girl in Chinese-style clothing, she actually belongs to the Yato Clan, one of the strongest and most bloodthirsty of the Amanto races. The Yato people are said to have \"transparent\" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan's weapon of choice; Kagura's is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motor-scooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise by her hands.\
 \
 She is also extremely flexible and fast; capable of catching multiple speeding bullets between her teeth and fingers. During battle, she's often seen flipping through the air and performing various acrobatic feats. Due to her Yato blood, she is capable of rapid regeneration. During the Benizakura arc, she is seen healing from a gunshot wound almost overnight.\
 \
 Kagura also has an unusually strong appetite. She is able to consume large quantities of food within a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, her tastes are endearingly plain. Sukonbu, rice, and eggs are among her favorite foods.\
 \
 Her immediate family consists of her father, Umibouzu, a widely recognized alien hunter, her mother, who is deceased, and her older brother Kamui, once presumed missing who is now involved with the space pirates Harusame.\
 \
 She came to Earth to earn money for her family. She found work fighting for a gang, but when they ordered her to kill her target, she ran away. Not long afterward, she met Gintoki and Shinpachi when Gintoki accidentally ran her down with his scooter. After they helped her to make a clean break from the gang, she intimidated Gintoki into hiring her. She now lives at the Yorozuya and sleeps in Gintoki's closet, like Doraemon.\
 \
 Kagura and Gintoki share an odd brother-younger sister-like relationship. Together with Shinpachi, the three of them makes for a strange, dysfunctional, yet tightly knit family. Kagura is very protective of Gintoki. Although she herself has gotten into many fights with him, she rarely lets anyone else pick on him. She seems to trust wholeheartedly in Gintoki's ability and strength. Even in sticky situations, she has no doubt that Gin-chan would come and save her. She has a tendency to imitate Gintoki's bad habits (like picking her nose or swearing, hence her unladylike behavior) and would often quote the bad advice he gives her. Some of her lines start with \"Gin-chan says...\" or \"Gin-chan told me...\"\
 \
 Kagura is also somewhat of a tomboy. She is often seen partaking in games with various neighborhood boys. Although her candid manner of speech often causes them to shun her, she doesn't seem to mind. In fact, she has no problem at all with forcing her way into their game. In battle, she has proven to be bull-headed and a sore loser. Like Gintoki, and probably because of his influence, she is not above resorting to petty tricks and manipulation to get the better of her adversary. Unlike many conventional manga heroines, she doesn't display the same consciousness toward decorum, table manners, and physical appearance. Puking, cussing, picking her nose, spitting, fighting, and scratching herself are common behavior for Kagura.\
 \
 She regards Okita, captain of the Shinsengumi, as a rival. She detests him and appeared to be disgusted when she previously mentioned (about Okita), that \"he definitely likes me,\" but as that hasn't been brought up since, it is uncertain on if it should be considered canon, that he apparently likes her.\
 \
 Although Kagura usually teases Shinpachi, she deeply cares for him and thinks of him as a brother. She also shows great respect toward his older sister, Shimura Tae, often calling her \"Anego\" (a term gangster women use to show respect).\
 \
 Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu (being her 27th pet), have met with an untimely demise by her hands (with the exception of Sadaharu 28,' a beetle killed by Okita). She cuddles with Sadaharu when feeling down. Kagura also seems to be the only one (aside from Ane, Mone, and Komako) who Sadaharu listens to.\
 \
 According to the OVA, Kagura is the first and only Weekly Shonen Jump girl to vomit on-screen. To date, she has induced herself to vomit on several occasions. She also has an uncanny knack for seeming calm or detached during high-tension situations; in episode 5, she slept through a car-chase. Her appetite knows no bounds, and she is especially fond of sukonbu.\
 \
 In Japanese, Kagura speaks in a stereotypical dialect that is associated with Chinese immigrants. In the English-translated manga, she punctuates her sentences with yup, uh-huh (aru), nope, and the like.\
 \
 In the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura meets her older brother, Kamui who abandoned her because she was weak in his eyes.\
 During the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura and Shinpachi teamed up against a Yato veteran named Abuto. When Shinpachi was mortally wounded by Abuto, Kagura can no longer hold against her Yato blood and revealed her true inner killing instincts against Abuto. Abuto is easily overwhelmed by Kagura's true power.\
 In the last Gintama character popularity poll, she came in the 6th place.\

 \
 Gintoki is a samurai living in an era when samurai are no longer needed. To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade planet Earth. Gintoki works taking on odd jobs alongside two kids: Kagura and Shinpachi. In the Joui war, he was known as the \"White Devil\" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white clothing he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear in the hearts of the Amanto.\
 \
 Gintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV's news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno's dog to get a chance to talk to her.(Though he later does with Tsukuyo as well when she discovers him shopping) Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response and merely puts up with them as annoyances.\
 \
 Gintoki has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet food such as parfaits, ice cream and cakes. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shounen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published). Gintoki will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a \"Bankai\" similar to the characters of Bleach.\
 \
 Despite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he's barely acquainted with, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa.\
 \
 Despite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joui war.\

 Shinpachi Shimura works under Gintoki to learn the ways of the samurai. He used to stay at his family's dōjo. However, it seems more like he's just trying to help Gintoki pay the rent than to learn. Shinpachi is the captain of the \"Otsu's Imperial Guard,\" a pop-singer's fan club.\
 \
 Shinpachi meets Gintoki after Shinpachi was tripped by the ambassador of Planet Chatoran. Gintoki beats up the ambassador and his guards, not to stand up for Shinpachi, but to get revenge for his spilled parfait. Gintoki frames Shinpachi for the crime, which somehow led to him saving Shimura Tae (Otae), Shinpachi's sister, from becoming part of a brothel.\
 \
 Despite his meek appearance, Shinpachi is a more than competent swordsman of his family's Kakidō-Ryu, the type of swordmanship his dojo teaches.\
 \
 In the character popularity poll, he was in 8th place.\
 \
 His name is roughly based on Shinsengumi member Nagakura Shinpachi and comedian Ken Shimura.\

Elizabeth was a present from Tatsuma Sakamoto, who presumably picked it up on his travels around space. Although many people consider Elizabeth to be insane and extraneous, Katsura has named the ambiguous avian \"Elizabeth\" and dotes on it. Once in episode 18 Shinpachi purchased a doll named as Space Alien Stefan (宇宙怪獣ステファン) to which looks perfectly similar to Elizabeth. Elizabeth is something of a painter, and is surprisingly dexterous. Also, Elizabeth resorts to using signboards to \"communicate,\" as well as an occasional means of attack. Elizabeth is also a skilled fighter, able to use signboards to fight off swordsmen. \
 Although the true identity of Elizabeth is uncertain, it appears to be a man wearing a duck costume. In its first appearance, hairy legs are seen underneath her sheet and the body of a humanoid with glowing eyes is revealed as her mouth is opened just as it fell during another battle between Gintoki and Katsura. Although Katsura seems shocked at what she really is, she has subsequently remained by his side. Episode 50 implies that the person inside Elizabeth is most likely the director (Gintoki was interrupted before he can finish being cut off at \"Kanto-\" (\"Direc-\"). Most of the characters seem to ignore this, or at least do not give it much thought, given at the episode was completely filler. Moreover, the next time the inside of Elizabeth is shown, it reverts to the glowing eyes.\
 \
 When Shinpachi boards Takasugi's ship in order to rescue Kagura, a bazooka is seen coming out of Elizabeth's mouth when she blasts the ship to distract everyone from Shinpachi. Because of this, Shinpachi refers to her as Elizabeth-senpai.\

 Hasegawa used to be an official working for the Bakufu, but after an unfortunate incident with Amanto dignitary Prince Hata, whom he was assigned to serve and protect, his superior asked him to succumb to his shame and commit seppuku, hearing that he ran away from his quarters.\
 \
 He initially believed that humans should focus on appeasing the Amanto, but after his encounter with Gintoki, his mindset changed, which led to him punching Hata out, thus getting fired. Since then, he has been living a life of somewhat like a loser, getting fired almost every time he gets a new job, mostly due to the unfavourable look his sunglasses and goatee give him.\
 \
 No matter what, he refuses to remove his sunglasses because it's the only thing he had left to remind him of his successful past. Although he does exchange the sunglasses for a decent pair of half-moon spectacles at one point, he goes back to wearing them after he decides that he is going to live out his life in the best way he can. He is constantly seen working various part-time jobs. He is often referred to as \"Madao,\" short for \"marude damena ossan,\" which roughly translates into \"totally useless middle-aged man.\"\
 \
 He and Gintoki are on good terms with one another and seem to spend most of their free time gambling. He often plays pachinko, but rarely ever wins. After losing his job for the Bakufu, he is seen doing odd jobs from time to time, like running a supermarket for a friend or driving a taxi at one time.\
 \
 He's currently estranged from his wife Hatsu, because of his jobless lifestyle, however they still keep in touch.\

 Hijikata is the famed chain smoking, vice commander of the Shinsengumi so named by his subordinates, because of his fearsome demeanor. Purportedly the brains behind the force, he takes his work seriously, and is fiercely loyal to his leader, Isao Kondo.\
 \
 Hijikata has a reputation as a fearsome leader, earning the nickname of \"demonic vice-commander.\" He is also hot-tempered and often speaks of seppuku. However, despite his cold exterior, he does have a more compassionate side. He also has a tendency to cry after watching movies that are not particularly emotional.\
 \
 Hijikata is obsessed with mayonnaise and thus has the nickname \"Mayora.\" He has been known to smother anything he eats under a mountain of mayonnaise, and he carries a number of objects shaped like jars of mayonnaise, such as his cigarette lighter. He was popular with girls until they discovered this obsession.\
 \
 He enjoys fighting and sees Gintoki as a rival in practically everything he does from drinking contests to rock, paper, scissors ever since being defeated by him in battle. He is in constant danger of being killed by the attempts on his life by Okita. But, despite all this, he sees Okita as one of his close friends, and vice versa.\
 \
 Before joining Shinsengumi, he used to be a trouble-maker ronin. He enjoys fighting/having a good fight and says he doesn't care how many Amanto buildings get blown up, he only looks forward to having a big battle with the Joui rebels after Shinsengumi has rounded them in 1 fell swoop, in Episode 5.\
 \
 He also formulated the Kyokuchuu Hatto, the 45 Regulations that form the disciplinary framework for Shinsengumi members, and implements them firmly.\

 Hiraga Gengai is Edo's greatest mechanic and inventor. He has helped Sakata Gintoki and the Yorozuya on several occasions.\
 \
 He makes ugly and crude machines, and his belief is that 'The machines of men are armour, cannons and caterpillars'.\
 \
 Gengai has a bad habit of modifying everything he has at hand, forgetting to tell the items' users important instructions on how to utilize them until it's too late. This usually results in the items' users getting into trouble. \
 \
 Hiraga Gengai was first introduced in Episode 17. Seemingly as a normal mechanic, the Yorozuya later found out that his only son, Hiraga Saburou had lost his life in the Joui wars. His only son's death left him with a deep emotional scar and Takasugi Shinsuke took advantage of that and used him to attack a festival in which the Shogun would be attending. However, with the help of the Yorozuya and the Shinsengumi, the attack was stopped and Gengai persuaded that revenge against the Bakufu was not the right course of action. \
 \
 Presently, he is the owner-proprietor of Machine Hall, a machine-repair workshop and inventor's office, and he frequently has to repair Gintoki's scooter. Even so, he is still a fugitive from the law, as seen from his wanted poster at the end of Episode 17, and as stated by Gintoki in the beginning of Episode 67.\
 \
 In the Lotus Chapter he helped repair Tama by re-using No.305's body. \
 \
 In the Tama's Virus Infection Chapter, he helped analyze the problem of Tama's pixelated look, sending the Yorozuya into her body to fight the viruses. \
 \
 In the Kabuki-cho arc, he appeared to help in the battle against the men of Doromizu Jirochou.\
 \
 In chapter 318 he repaired Sa-chan's glasses, and in chapter 321, it was discovered that he actually turned the glasses into some kind of mass destruction weapon.\

 Katsura is Gintoki's former comrade during the Joi war. Even after the Amanto take-over of Japan, Katsura continues to resist the Amanto, and has amassed a band of followers. His weapon of choice is a metallic grenade. He is a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, and is constantly on the run from the Shinsengumi. Although his initial methods were originally more violent in nature (for instance, sending a bomb to an Amanto embassy), Katsura has gradually grown to believe that there are people important to him in Edo, and decides that he no longer wants to destroy the country, but believes there should be a way to change it without causing sacrifices.\
 \
 Katsura seems to be highly respected by his followers, and has even been called the \"Daybreak of the Joui Faction\" by some. When people believed that Katsura had died during the Benizakura arc, even other terrorist groups tried to avenge his death.\
 Since he is a wanted man, Katsura is often seen wearing disguises, although his identity is often still easily found out. One example of a disguise he seems to be fond of is a pirate's costume, complete with an eyepatch (with a skull design) over his left eye and a scar on his right cheek, and using this he calls himself 'Space Captain Katsura'.\
 \
 Katsura seems to possess a rather outdated sense of humour, and sometimes refers to things from a past era, such as when he tried to buy a Famicon when people were queuing up to buy the OwEe (a parody of the Wii). He also seems to have a tendency to make up dramatic stories, which moves others to tears when they hear these stories (except Gintoki).\
 Katsura sometimes works odd jobs (e.g. in Episode 88), to raise money for his terrorist activities. He claims that his heart has started to be moved by Ikumatsu in episode 39 (chapter 55 equivalent of the manga), and held his subsequent interview in her ramen restaurant.\
 \
 In the Japanese version, Gintoki often calls him \"Zura.\" In the first English volume, Gintoki calls him \"Casserole,\" or \"Cough syrup.\" Eventually, the English version changed to Gintoki calling Katsura \"Zura.\" In the Japanese version, Katsura indignantly replies \"Not 'Zura'! It's Katsura!\" (and will do so anytime he is called something other than his name). In the English version he replies \"Not Casserole! It's Katsura!\" The Japanese version joke is a pun, since \"Katsura\" can mean wig in Japanese and \"Zura\" is slang for the same thing. The English version is also a wordplay since \"Katsura\" and \"Casserole\" sound somewhat similar in pronunciation. He has the uncanny ability to know when someone has called him something other than Katsura, even in their head. An example being in Episode 25 as a guest to Gintoki's hotpot dinner.\
 \
 His name is based on the historical Katsura Kogoro.\

 He is described as an assassin and is one of the strongest swordsmen of the Kiheitai, under the leadership of Takasugi. He is a member of the Kiheitai, an extremist Joui faction bent on causing world destruction. \
 \
 Bansai is always seen wearing a pair of sunglasses and large headphones decorated with a yin-yang pattern. He regularly keeps his headphones on, as well as sun glasses even while others are talking to him. He carries and is skilled at playing a shamisen, which also doubles as a tool for tying others up or as a weapon similar to a garrote.\
 \
 On top of being famous as a skilled swordsman, Bansai is also a talented songwriter. He works as a music producer under the name \"Tsunpo\", and Otsu's newer songs are written by him. Bansai's background remains unknown; however, it is known that he fights alongside Takasugi in order to destroy the \"rotten\" world which resulted from the loss against the alien Amanto after the Joui conflict. \
 \
 It is uncertain how much Bansai actually picks up from his conversations with other people, seeing as he is always wearing headphones, that is also how he got the nickname Deaf Man.\
 \
 Bansai is shown to have an extremely calm demeanor, which covers up the fact that he has a vicious, almost cruel personality which actively seeks out conflict.\
 \
 Bansai is very invested in his music hobby, frequently playing his shamisen and often comparing to other characters as musical genres. Bansai refers to Gintoki as drunken humming and Hijikata as a children's anime theme song.\
 \
 Being a refined speaker, he speaks in the Japanese humble manner by using \"de gozaru\" at the end of the sentences and referring to himself as \"sessha\", a notably antiquated way of speaking. \
 \
 Bansai's name is roughly based on that of a hitokiri of the Bakumatsu era, Kawakami Gensai, while his stage name is based on the musician Tsunku.\

 \
 Usually jolly and cheerful, she had a moment of notable change in her personality after she married Shirino Douman, during which time she would become weaker every day and sit alone on the porch of their house, gazing into the sky. It is hinted that it wasn't the marriage itself that was the reason her personality changed so much, as there were various flashbacks where she got along well with Douman in her childhood, but rather that she had to quit her dayjob. However, after they had been divorced and she returned to her position as a weather lady, she became her old self again.\
 \
 Later on, she would hire the Yorozuya when the Shirino clan used sorcery to alter the weather, so that her weather reports all became wrong, as seen in the Exorcist Chapter.\

 She is quick-tempered and prone to screeching when she's upset. This is evident when she has a \"spitting fight\" with Kagura after she spat at her and when she starts yelling at Kagura after her underwear is said to be stained. She shoots Kagura through the shoulder when Kagura breaks onto the ship. She interacts the most with Takechi, calling him 'senpai' and also calling him a 'pervert' and a 'lolicon' for sparing Kagura instead of killing her.\
 \
 At the end of the Benizakura arc, she is wounded by Okada after he loses control.\
 Her name is roughly based on a samurai of the Bakumatsu era, Kijima Matabei.\

 Kondo Isao is the Commander of the Shinsengumi. When not working, he is also the stalker of Shimura Tae, earning him the nickname Gorilla-stalker. \
 \
 His superior is Matsudaira Katakuriko, a high-ranking government officer under direct control of the Bakufu. Even though the Shinsengumi are loyal to Kondo, he often has to use the Shinsengumi Vice-Commander Hijikata Toushirou to settle them down (with harsh words or use of violence) before conducting a speech. \
 \
 Kondo is good friends with Hijikata Toushirou and Okita Sougo of the Shinsengumi, and if one of them ever strayed, then the other two would punch him back to where he belongs, as Kondo once told Sougo. Sougo also often remarks that Kondo's nice-guy attitude is also his weakness as he never notices negative points about other people.\
 \
 In the Mutiny arc, he was described by Itou Kamotarou as honest, pure and unsullied. In the same arc, Hijikata Toushirou described him as the soul of the Shinsengumi, and the rest of them being the sword that protects him. Hijikata also said that everybody joined the Shinsengumi so that they could be with Kondo, and that as long as he was there, the Shinsengumi would not be finished. \
 \
 When Kondo once asked Shimura Tae whether she would still love her boyfriend if he had a hairy butt. She became the target of his stalking when she replied that she would love her boyfriend just as much, hairy butt and all. Being a stalker of Tae, Kondo is often seen getting beat up or threatened by her, as she highly disapproves of his stalking and affection towards her. \
 \
 In the Yagyuu arc, Kondo had his mind set on being Shimura Shinpachi's brother-in-law, even going as far as saying Shinpachi was the only one he could entrust the Shinsengumi to, much to Shinpachi's annoyance, answering that he doesn't give a damn about the Shinsengumi.\
 \
 In his childhood, Kondo Isao was a member of a dojo in Bushuu. There, he would soon meet Okita Sougo and Hijikata Toushirou, recruiting them both into his dojo. Kondo would later on take all the members with him and move from Bushuu to Edo in search for success, becoming what is now the Shinsengumi. \
 \
 Some characters in the series often call him \"gorilla\" due to his hirsute nature and although he is angered with this nickname, he sometimes uses the same word to identify himself. \
 \
 Kondo is loosely based on the historical Kondo Isami, famed for his role as commander of the Shinsengumi during the Bakumatsu period.\

 Hayase (No. 502) wanted to give Fuyou, Hayase&rsquo;s daughter, a lot more friends. Hayase also conducted an experiment to fuse Fuyou&rsquo;s body inside Tamas (No.0 at the time), but that ended up killing Fuyou in the process. No. 502, while not having a soul implanted into him, was working alongside another person willing to takeover the Fuyou Project along with another pink-haired robot maid. At that moment when Tama showed Gintoki & Kagura the body of Professor Hayase, Hayase began to creep up near the head of Tama and began to fuse his own body into No. 502&rsquo;s.\
 \
 When No. 502 retrieved the head of Tama, the seed was missing from Tama. To retrieve the seed back, he planned a hijack at the Terminal. The plan was nearly a big success and he was about to use Shinpachi as a test person until Gintoki tried to kill No. 502. It was later revealed that Professor Hayase was actually alone himself. After Fuyou and Gintoki explained that to him, No. 502 continued the hijack anyway and tried to kill both Shinpachi and Gintoki. Kagura and Gengai&rsquo;s Robots, however, prevented No. 502 from killing Gintoki and Tama began to prevent No. 502 from running away. Gintoki, who would escape, would move No. 502 and Hayase&rsquo;s soul into the power of the Terminal, thus eventually killing him.\

 Occupation: First Division Captain Shinsengumi \
 \
 Okita is the best swordsman in the Shinsengumi. Personality-wise, he tends to be light-hearted and somewhat childish though his speech is heavily deadpan. \
 \
 He outwardly displays annoyance and dislike for Hijikata, and continuously tries to harm and humiliate him whenever given the chance.\
 \
 Losing his parents at a young age, he was raised by his sister, Mitsuba. Thus, although he is sadistic and violent towards other people, Okita absolutely adores his sister and does everything he can to please her. Mitsuba is one of the reasons why Okita hates Hijikata. Okita viewed Hijikata as a rival for his sister's attention. He also greatly dislikes the fact that Hijikata treated Mitsuba coldly, although Mitsuba clearly showed signs of liking Hijikata.\
 Okita has great affection and fondness for Kondo, who took him under his wings when he was little. He still regards Hijikata as one of his three friends (the other two being Kondo and Gintoki).\
 \
 He enjoys seeing women fight, finding the ugly looks on their faces as they grab each other being hilarious. He wears a distinctive eye mask when taking a nap during duty, which is a frequent occurrence. At one point, he refers to himself as the best sniper in the Shinsengumi. Although he is a master of kenjutsu, he uses a bazooka more often.\
 \
 He also regards Kagura as a rival after an unfinished rock-paper-scissors duel during a sakura-blossom party. He states that he'll \"be the only one to defeat her\", and usually calls her \"China\".\
 \
 In the original Japanese manga he likes to end his sentences in \"~desaa\" and \"~desuzee.\"\
 \
 In Sorachi's original character design, Okita was a female, and wielded an umbrella. This concept was ultimately given to Kagura.\
 \
 In the second Shounen JUMP character popularity poll, he ranked 2nd place, just below Gintoki.\
 \
 In volume 12, Okita's age is revealed to be 18. Despite being under Japan's legal drinking age, in Edo, you can drink alcohol from 15.\
 \
 His name is based on the historical Okita Souji.\

She suffers from tuberculosis, and often requires medical treatment, which Sougo used to send money for. She has romantic feelings for Hijikata.

 Sarutobi Ayame is a ninja from the Oniwabanshuu by training, but is currently working as an assassin. She also has a part-time job at the Kunoichi Caf&eacute;. \
 \
 Since her initial appearance, she has developed a serious obsessive infatuation with Sakata Gintoki, to the point of even stalking him. She is severely myopic, to the point of being almost blind (cannot tell living things from inanimate objects) without her eye glasses. It was also hinted that she doesn't see well even with her eyeglasses on, as she once mistook Kagura (dressed up as Gintoki) for Gintoki himself. However, this could solely be due to her infatuation with him. She has frequently clashed with Otae for various reasons.\
 \
 Ayame has a playful attitude, but gets serious when it comes to her work. She also seems to enjoy bondage and S&M. Although Gintoki is indifferent to her affections and even treats her badly most times (e.g throwing things at her whenever he senses her stalker presence), her 'M' or masochistic personality only makes her enjoy the punishment, and his 'cruelty' only serves to encourage her.\

 Sasaki Isaburou was born into the elite samurai family Sasaki, as the main heir. He is also the half brother to Sasaki Tetsunosuke.\

 His personality is completely different when writing e-mails by cellphone. He insists people to call him Sabu-chan and states that he doesn't have many friends.

 Tae Shimura is Shinpachi's older sister. She runs the Kakidokan Dojo, which was her father's failing dojo, with her brother. She is usually addressed as \"Otae\"; the \"O\" is an honorific used to refer to women. Kagura always addresses her as \"Big sister\"(ane-go).\
 \
 Despite her sweet face, she is one of the most violent characters in Gintama (and arguably strong too). She mercilessly beats up Kondo Isao and Gintoki whenever they anger her; in episode 19, she mercilessly kicks the men out onto the road (namely her brother, Gintoki and Hasegawa) so as to stop a car for a hitch ride. She often displays her trademark sweet-looking smile with her eyes closed before engaging in her violent activities. Her killer intent is so strong that on one occasion, a stare from her brings the entire Shinsengumi on their knees begging for mercy. Her weapon of choice seems to be a naginata, a Japanese spear.\
 \
 Her cooking skills are terrible, seeing as her tamagoyaki (i.e. sweet fried egg) is so inedible that Kondo suffers amnesia after eating it and others are barely able to swallow it down. Yamazaki even describes it as \"poison\" after some of it accidentally gets into his eye. When Kagura tried to hypnotize herself into eating Otae's cooking, Shinpachi objected, saying that Otae's cooking is the reason for his poor eyesight.\

 She has strong principles and believes in maintaining what is precious, even if it means throwing away honor and dignity. She once says that if apologies were enough, seppuku would not exist. Her favourite food is H&auml;agen-Dazs ice-cream, but it is called Bargain Dash in the manga and anime.\

 Zodiac: Leo\
 Hair: Black (purple highlights)\
 Eyes: Light Olive Green (bandage over left eye)\
 Height: 170cm\
 Weight: 60kg\
 Occupation: Leader of the Kiheitai\
 Hobbies: Smoking a pipe, Playing a shamisen\
 \
 A former comrade of Gintoki and Katsura and a major antagonist. He now leads a radical Joui faction called the Kiheitai and is known amongst the Shinsengumi as 'the most dangerous man in both the Joui faction and amongst the radicals'. He is easily recognizable through his bandaged left eye, his colorful  kimono, his eerie smile, and the pipe he is often seen smoking.\
 \
 He, Gintoki, and Katsura studied in the same temple elementary school when they were children, and he fought with them against the Amanto invasion during the latter part of the Joui war. After the war ended, he vanished, and has since gained a dangerous reputation due to his assassination of many of the Bakufu's main officers and his planning of a large-scale coup d'etat. Before his first appearance in both the anime and the manga, he was mentioned to have fled Edo and to have been hiding in Kyoto, although it is unclear how long before this was.\
 \
 He now believes that the only way to save it is to destroy the \"rotten\" post-Joui war world.\
 \
 He is shown to like festivals, although this is mainly due to the opportunity they provide for a large-scale terrorist attack: he appears to have an attraction to ruin that is almost nihilistic. He also appears to have considerable insight due to his 'seeing through Itou's heart' and subsequently planting him in the Shinsengumi's ranks.\
 \
 It can be assumed that he is as skilled a swordsman as both Gintoki and Katsura, having fought alongside them as one of the 'heroes' of the Joui war. That aside, he appears to have at least considerable skill in playing the shamisen, and is shown at one point playing it with Bansai as they talk.\

 He is based on the historical Takasugi Shinsaku.\

 Tama is an android that was found by Gintoki. At the time she was only a disembodied head. She was given her name by Kagura, who was obsessed with eating egg on rice at the time. She is an android maid currently working at Otose's Snack House. When she isn't cleaning or serving Otose's customers, she often visits the Yorozuya Gin-Chan to collect rent.\
 \
 Tama was originally an android created by Professor Hayashi to provide his sickly daughter with a companion. But when the professor tried to implant the personality of his daughter into Tama, the experiment killed his daughter in the process. Tama however, possesses the element known as the \"Seed\", allowing her to retain some of Fuyou's personality and making her capable of human emotions.\
 \
 Even though Tama is an android, she is capable of human emotions. Her interactions with living human beings, however, often seem to be severely limited by her lack of knowledge of the outside world. This is due to a memory loss she already suffered before her initial introduction. As the series progresses, however, it seems that Tama learns more and more just from being around the Yorozuya Gin-Chan. She also seems to have some rather strange main functions, such as imitating the Dragon Quest RPG. \

 An idol pop singer whose song lyrics are often very dirty or controversial. She started her career singing on the sides of streets. This was when Shinpachi met her and has followed her ever since, being captain of her fan club. Her talent was recognized by Bansai Kawakami (under his producer alias \"Tsunpo\"), and she has since gained popularity. Her mother manages her, and her father is currently serving time in prison. When she was younger, her father made a bet with her, saying that if she became famous, he would bring a number of roses to her first concert. He broke out of prison specially for the occasion, and although he couldn't give her the roses, he gave her a single flower. He donned a paper bag over his head, so he wouldn't trouble her with his presence, yet she knew it was him, and thanked him with tears in her eyes.\

 Tojou is Kyubei's servant, who is extremely dedicated, if not obsessive, in his concern for his young master. He generally speaks in a very polite manner, using -masu and -desu instead of the short dictionary forms usually employed in a normal male-speech. \
 \
 He addresses Kyubei as waka, which means young master and has for years kept a diary recording Kyubei's activities. Kyubei is usually indifferent to Tojou's excessive attention, although she did kick him when he commented that gothic lolita clothes would suit her. Tojou's eyes are normally closed unless he is surprised or under emotional distress. If his eyes do open, the whites of his eyes are actually black, and his pupils either glow with an unearthly green, blue or red. He has an obsession with beating a raw, unbroken egg yolk on his rice for meals (as shown when the egg yolk broke, and him going into a berserk rage quite uncharacteristic with his usual demeanor).\
 \
 His name is based on Aya Tojou of the manga Strawberry 100%.\

 Tsukuyo is a blonde-haired woman with a scar over her forehead and left cheek. One of the better known Hundred Blooms of Yoshiwara, a law enforcement squad of Yoshiwara that consists of all females, deployed by the Night King Hosen. Despite appearing to be a heartless person when approached by Odd Jobs when he arrives to Yoshiwara, throwing a fake kunai to their foreheads, she later becomes friends with them. She has a difficult past being orphaned as a child, only to be picked up and raised by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. While the original motive for Jiraia was to instill every bit of despair and tragedy of his own life into Tsukuyo, of who he refers to as his art or perfect creation, Tsukuyo ended up growing attached to what he did not manage to do. That is \"Friends, A Home, and Precious Things To Protect\" as told by Jiraia. Her loyalty and home lies with Hinowa in the underground city of Yoshiwara. She has ties with Hinowa, who also helped raise her like an older sister/mother through her childhood.\
 \
 It is hinted by Jiraia (in Chapter 255/Episode 178) Hinowa and Seita (in Chapter 294) that she has romantic feelings for Gintoki. This is further supported by her scribbling out statements from Hinowa's and Seita's New Year's cards commenting how lonely she was when they heard Gintoki has gotten married and her inability to give him chocolates for Valentine's Day (in Episode 204). Tsukyo herself has confirmed that, while she doesn't quite know what they are or what to do with them, she has some feelings towards Gintoki. This was in episode 177 when she said to him, \"When I am with you, my resolve weakens. Don't shake up my feelings any further.\"\

 Switch (スイッチ) is the brains and secretary to the Sket-Dan. He is an otaku (no matter how many times he denies it) that has information about EVERYONE in Kaimei-high. Switch appears to be the most serious of the group but his fooling around says otherwise. He also has a strong belief in Science which is shown through his rivalry against Occult lover, Yuuki Reiko. The most unique thing about Switch is that he talks through a computer which is most likely due to Psychological trauma. \
 \
 The reason he doesn't talk is quite possibly because he believes something he said was the cause of his younger brothers death.\
 Near the end of the manga, before their graduation ceremony, Switch decides to put away his laptop and expressing his love for his friends Bossun and Himeko with his own words.\

 Kaoru is a ninja and a member of the Shinobi 5, a mercenary ninja group for hire. She is familiar with Zenzo, and attended his father's funeral. She has been seen working in a flower shop into which Kagura crashed with scooter, damaging a flower-petal birthday present that was planned for Michiko, the wife of Kaoru's manager at another of her part-time jobs, the Kunoichi Caf&eacute; where also Ayame works.\
 \
 Much like Sarutobi Ayame, Kaoru is often childish and playful, eg. when the two of them were supposed to fight during the Ninja Battle in the Elizabeth Rescue episode, but spent a long time just staring and trash talking each other. However, she gets serious when it comes to work.\

 Kyuubei is the sole heir to the Yagyuu family, being the daughter of Yagyuu Koshinori and granddaughter of Yagyuu Binbokusai. She is brought up as a male, following the code of a samurai. She is a genius swordsman; surpassing average swordsmen in skills, and is able to hold herself against veteran swordsmen, like Hijikata Toushirou and Sakata Gintoki.\
 \
 During her introduction, she tried to take Shimura Tae as her fiancee, though Shimura Shinpachi and the rest stopped her from doing it. She still has feelings for Tae, though they remained in friendly ties. She usually follows wherever Tae goes and does the same things that Tae is doing. She also protects Tae from the stalker Kondou Isao.\
 \
 She is always being guarded by Toujou Ayumu, to the point of him being overprotective towards her. Ayumu also tries to convince her to wear gothic lolita outfits, which cause irritation to her, blasting/beating him up because of it.\
 \
 In recent Gintama chapters, she became the target of jealousy of Katsura Kotarou, as he felt that she is recently becoming more active in the manga spotlight than him.\
 \
 Kyuubei has a bit of a cold personality, probably due to how she trained herself to become strong. However, Tae's influence is currently shaping a more softer Kyuubei, as they share more time together during their free time. \
 \
 She also has an automatic reflex against men who touch her or she touches (though she did rescue Gin one time by catching his hand). \
 \
 In episode 190 it's revealed that, apparently, she really likes Otae's cooking. \
 \
 Her name is probably referring to the famous samurai Yagyu Jubei Mitsuyoshi, due to \"Ju\" meaning \"Ten\" and \"Kyu\" meaning \"Nine.\"\

 Yamazaki is a spy, whose specialty is naturally gathering intelligence. Yamazaki is often caught by Hijikata playing badminton by himself, and he is subsequently beaten. He is often seen cosplaying as a badminton-playing version of Echizen Ryoma from The Prince of Tennis. In episode 62 he was caught saying \"Mada mada dane\", which is Ryoma Echizen's catchphrase.\
 \
 His role as a ninja is roughly based on Yamazaki Susumu, but is never really exercised besides one unsuccessful attempt to spy on Gintoki. Despite having a rivalry with Shinpachi, they most often see eye-to-eye out of their respective groups.\
 \
 Despite his lack of screen time, he came in 9th in the Gintama character popularity poll. But even with his popularity, Sorachi has clearly stated that he will never be on a cover of a Gintama volume.\
 \
 His name is based on the historical Yamazaki Susumu.\

  synopsis = "During the Edo period, Japan is suddenly invaded by alien creatures known as the \"Amanto.\" Despite the samurai's attempts to combat the extraterrestrial menace, the Shogun soon realizes that their efforts are futile and decides to surrender. This marks the beginning of an uneasy agreement between the Shogunate and Amanto, one that results in a countrywide sword ban and the disappearance of the samurai spirit. However, there exists one eccentric individual who wields a wooden sword and refuses to let his samurai status die. Now that his kind are no longer needed, Gintoki Sakata performs various odd jobs around town in order to make ends meet. Joined by his self-proclaimed disciple Shinpachi Shimura, the fearsome alien Kagura, and a giant dog named Sadaharu, they run the business known as Yorozuya, often getting caught up in all sorts of crazy and hilarious shenanigans.
