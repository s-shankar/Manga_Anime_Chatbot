    Ever since I was little I was a hardcore fight fan, I loved watching shows where the antagonists had to battle for the survival of all they held dear, even now I hold fondly the anime that had given me my first taste as it aired on my morning cartoon network \"Cheese TV.\" It was a boring morning when I stumbled upon the Dragonball manga and I soon found that morning cheering up as I delightfully relived the story of Goku and his Dragonball adventures.\
Story [10/10]\
If a manga like Dragonball were to only appear now, I would have probably given it an 8 or 9,\
          \
        though I have chosen to keep its original context in mind.\
As I just mentioned; if Dragonball were to be released now, then it wouldn't have been as popular as it is today, this is because when the manga came out it was something new and unbelievable that the world had never really seen. The manga was one of the crucial founders of shounen fighting manga and anime; it set all the stereotypes and the benchmarks. Dragonball was one of the greatest stories of its generation and would leave a legacy on all shounen manga that would follow as the style continues to advance and refine to suit the times. Popular anime and manga like Naruto and Bleach all have roots in Dragonball.\
Now, as for the story itself, I would say it's very good on its own terms. It takes an ancient Chinese tale and turns it into something completely different: a wacky adventure of a monkey-tailed jungle boy and a blue-haired tech head heiress of which would later be joined by more and more companions, some with rocky beginnings though all charmed by the protagonist, Goku's, innocence.\
Goku's natural strength would always be questioned until later in the manga when his true identity is revealed as an adult (I would expect everyone to know, but I won't spoil it, just in case) which would give him the opportunity to face opponents stronger than he'd ever faced in an intergalactic setting.\
Dragonball's sense of romance was kind of vague; the manga would skip large amounts of time, rarely even offering as much as a montage to explain the gap. Most romantic relationships would take place between these times. I felt that this was probably one of the best methods, the concept of lovey-dovey romance happening within Dragonball is shudder-worthy, it would undermine the true focus of the anime and so, as a result, even the cutest pairing were laced with violence, screaming spouses throwing threats at one another, it was the manga's own form of love.\
Art [10/10]\
The style enjoyed sitting out of the box.\
Before Dragonball most anime and manga were similar to Astro Boy or the work of Hayao Miyazaki, but then came Dragonball sporting veined muscles and antagonists like king Piccollo and Frieza.\
The settings were unique as well, like an alternate universe to our own world filled with amusing sterotypes from around the world, the terrain ranging from desert to jungles, cities to islands.\
The world was made the playground for this manga.\
Characters [10/10]\
Like any fighting manga or anime, it was very character driven, creating unique and wacky personalities and character designs with very well thought out back story that would always come back to bite them somewhere in the manga, no matter how far forward. In Dragonball especially, the character development was evident, as the characters changed and aged physically and mentally, maturing in all their own chosen occupations.\
Enjoyment [10/10]\
I will have to say that the reason I enjoyed this manga the most was because of the nostalgia that I felt from reading it, I could remember a time back when I was just four or five years old when I would sit and watch, even though I can't remember much about my childhood, I still hang onto so many memories of watching Goku fight Frieza on planet Namek, of trunks and his father fighting cell among others.\
I remember and it feels good to be reminded.\

    I read the whole series as a teen, so it may sound or come out different from me than other reviewers.  But as it is coming from a \"teen\", i found this to be extremely enjoyable.  There are many flaws and weaknesses in this manga, but i seemed to understand why many called Toriyama, the creator of DragonBall, a genius.  DragonBall surpasses all odds in its infinite path of making new friends, fighting new foes, and discovering new powers.  In other words, you can call it the perfect raw shounen manga for younger audiences and perhaps teens like myself.\
Story 9/10\
To me\
          \
        this is both a weakness and a strong point of the series.  Different arcs have different stories behind them but they all connect and make sense in the end.  Although everything connects however, some parts seem like they lose understanding and basic common sense.  Though rare, sometimes, the reader might feel or want to say \"Well this makes sense, but why didn't they do this, or why couldn't they have done that before.\" \
I do give the author credit though, for it is not easy to connect everything perfectly clearly with such a long series.  I think the author balanced everything to work out pretty well.\
However, when the plot gets really good into something you didn't expect, that's when the series really starts to shine.  Secrets are uncovered and mysteries you could never imagine occur in this wonderful storyline giving it a solid 9/10.\
Art 10/10\
This one's quite obvious i think.  The action sequences are very nicely drawn with wonderful design of landscapes and characters.  Also the way the technology is drawn still amuses me :)\
Character 9/10\
First thing first, I have to say the way the characters were created and how it applies to them is pure genius.  Absolute amazing creativity with variety as well.  This series ranges from humans to saiyans to animals to aliens to different aliens to organisms to BUBBLE GUM.  I mean BUBBLE GUM.  If thats not enough of variety u also got two types (SPOILER* xP). A fat one and an evil looking one.\
There is a backside to this though, which is why i rated it a 9 out of 10, and that is the character development.  This seems to come out as a fatal flaw in the series.  Important characters who were good friends of goku (SPOILER* xP) like Yamcha and Tien have seemed to lost their importance.  Bulma who first discovered Goku, seems to have almost no part in his life afterwards.  She seems to end up as the casual techno girl and cheerleader for Goku while he's fighting.  But, even though there are some characters who seem to become unimportant, some new characters undergo a very nice change in development.  For example characters like (SPOILER* xP) Vegeta, Piccolo, the androids, Buu, even Satan, seem to become important and likable characters in the series.  Despite it's flaw in the development of some characters, it doesn't do quite much to affect the wonderful variety of characters and enjoyment in DragonBall.\
Enjoyment 10/10\
Really enjoyed this series.  What more to say about it. x)\
Overall 10/10\
Don't get intimidated by the flaws i posted. (I'm just a mean reviewer :P)\
Overall, DragonBall is a wonderful series filled with adventure and excitement.  It's just incredible.  You can't miss it!\

    Dragon Ball is a popular manga written in the 80's-90's, about a young boy named Son Gokuu and his friends, going on adventures and most of all: fighting.\
Story:\
The story starts with Son Gokuu, an 11-year old boy (who thinks he's 14) who lives alone in the mountains. One day he meets the young genius girl Bulma, who tells him about the dragon balls, seven magical stones with the power to summon a dragon, which will grant any wish, and she wants the dragon to give her the perfect boyfriend.\
This however, is only the introduction to some of the characters and the concept of the dragon\
          \
        balls. But the story is really about fighting bad people who want to kill innocent people for fun.\
The story is simple and sometimes only serves the purpose of introducing more fights, but it works. Big intrigues and complex plans for world domination just doesn't fit in, which is why it's lucky that none of that is in there. Dragon Ball is more about the experience than the story, and the story isn't at all bad. It just isn't the best one out there, but it is one of the most entertaining ones, but more on that later.\
Characters:\
The characters in Dragon Ball are all memorable and likeable. From Son Gokuu to Majin Buu, everyone feels like a valid addition to the Dragon Ball universe.\
Gokuu is the protagonist, and you can almost call him the original Luffy or Natsu, meaning that hes is simple-minded/ stupid, he eats a lot, and he is ridiculously strong. Other than that the characters don't have that many traits, yes Bulma is smart and goofy, Gohan doesn't like fighting, and Piccolo and Vegeta are evil, but not much is known about the characters other than that, yet somehow they are still so likeable. Also the little character-development in here is surprisingly interesting.\
But there are problems, especially that there are so many characters, that some just lose their roles eventually and just disappear from the story. This is annoying because at some points you will miss them. Other than that there are no complaints about the characters.\
Design:\
The animation and design are very good. Though every character has very similiar facial features (except for Kuririn's lack of a nose), everyone looks distinct, mainly because of different clothes and hair style (and by God does Bulma have many of those). Though one weird thing is that apparently in this universe, people (well, mainly the men) don't age past the age of 18, everyone looks exactly the same in the epilogue as they did when you got to know them in the series, which is kind of weird.\
There are also many \"derp-moments\" and the characters both look and are hilarious, in these situations.\
Something surprising about this manga is that even though the beginning is kind of perverted, absolutely all of the women are almost flat chested. This is quite unusual, since many shounen manga have women with so big boobs that it just looks stupid, so it's good that the women aren't there just for fan service, but to advance the plot.\
The biggest part of Dragon Ball is the fighting, and it looks great. The ki attacks (e.g. the Kamehame-Ha) the characters' animation during the fights, results from fighting to the environments, and the different transformations all look simply amazing, and it is a huge plus.\
The manga is also surprisingly bloody, and violent, which is also positive.\
Theme:\
The manga is pretty simple, for the most part it is about fighting evil, and protecting the universe from these evil-doers. Friendship is also a very large part of it, and you can feel the relationships changing between the characters, always in a good way. Death also has a role to play, not Death the person, but the manga includes life after death, and the different people in charge also appear with their own quirks. Also the humour is simply hilarious, every joke is good and sets a very good tone that fits well with everything else.\
Enjoyment:\
Dragon Ball is one of the best mangas I've ever read, and it keeps a safe spot on my Top 5. The memorable characters, the perfect pacing, and the great animation, forces anyone who's ever enjoyed a shounen manga to simply love this work. Yes it does have faults, especially that the beginning is pretty boring, but hilarious, but absolutely  everything the show does bad, there is something amazing which more than compensates. The manga is just that close to perfection.\
Also, though the manga started in 1984 and ended in 1995, unlike any anime from the same time, it doesn't show. It could easily be mistaken for one being published today. It almost feels as if chapter 521 will be released in the upcoming Shounen Jump, but then again it may be good that it won't happen, with the perfect ending and all.\
The re-read value is also high, and it's much better the second time around.\

    A hilarious manga telling us the story of the life of Son Goku, one of the last members of his race.\
This manga may be old, but it sure as hell deserves to be ranked as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) manga of all time. This manga is full of battles, adventures and the art improves over time. Read through many time skips to see the young Goku grow up to be a well respectably powerful man. I thoroughly enjoyed the manga to the point I pulled late nights just to read.\

    Story:\
There's something magical about Dragon Ball. From its starting point searching for the Dragon Ball to the final fight to save the Universe, there's a genuine feel of adventure and progress that is felt while reading this manga. I feel like I've come so far, met so many people, and survived so much despite only reading it on a page. And everything is memorable from the master assassin Taopaipai to the mysterious Android 16, every interaction you observe Goku partake in seems to have some kind of special moment that engrains itself into my memory. I mean, everything was so EXCITING! I had a blast\
          \
        reading chapters of the many Budokai tournaments, the horrifying villains that took solace in murder, and the ridiculous comedic perversions of Kame-sennin.\
What's especially amazing is how the manga exponentially increases in quality with each passing arc. Each arc brings something new to the table and culminates with something unique and unpredictable. It's filled with moments that seem boisterous and extravagant but also have a subtle level of intimacy to their characterization. Most notably is the first moment that Goku becomes Super Saiyan. The rising action to this revelation is brilliant and the moment it happens, so much is implied about what Goku is thinking without him uttering a word. In fact, this happens many times within Dragon Ball and it really lends to the creative talent of Akira Toriyama.\
However, with a manga as long as this one, it's evident that there would be problems, and that's most recognized with the final arc. Although there's a bit of a balance to how one can look at it, the ending isn't exactly what I would call satisfying as I would say acceptable. The Cell arc precedes the Majin Buu arc and with how the Cell arc ends, it feels as though the world of Dragon Ball is in for a treat with the following one. It even teases this transition with the Great Saiyaman arc, implying that what you might be expecting is actually going to become true. However, upon finishing the Majin Buu arc, you're subjected to a world-class ruse and left feeling a little hollow. Does it truly impact my experience with Dragon Ball? Not as a whole, but as a grade? Yes. It's so detrimental that it's bumped my opinion of Dragon Ball as a whole from a 10/10 to a 9/10 solely for the climax of the Majin Buu arc. It's why I'm eager to see where Dragon Ball is headed with the new movies and hopefully Dragon Ball Super (assuming it has an original arc beyond what we've seen in the new films.)\
But, all in all, Dragon Ball's story isn't just an extravagant out-of-this-world martial arts manga, it's a great character narrative where everyone becomes a little more of themselves with each passing page. Although everyone stays largely static, there are subtle changes in everyone that makes for a realistic feel to it. I've come to love Krillin as the most powerful human on Earth. I've come to respect Piccolo as an amazing surrogate father and warrior. I've come to look up to Vegeta and how his determination and pride didn't take over his life in the end. There's so much to love about Dragon Ball, and recognizing its impact on the Manga community isn't enough to do it justice. Reading it and experiencing it for yourself is absolutely recommended.\
\
Art:\
Brilliant, amazing art. Although backgrounds become rubble regularly and the art near the end of the manga becomes a little rough, the character designs, worlds, and 'animation' of each page and panel is so excellent I cannot even begin to describe how monumental of an achievement it is. I mean, this is a seriously big deal. For each character to have their own traits, for each world to look have subtle yet recognizable locations, and most importantly, for the pages to look so fluid. Hoooo boy. I mean, You will be falling in love with how the manga reads. Every moment looks like it's truly alive.  Every punch, kick, and jump looks like it's coming right out of the page and happening before your eyes. It's incredible.\
\
Character:\
Again, I mentioned how each character has such subtle yet realistic growth. Most importantly, it happens over a long, long time. I mean, this manga spans what can be assumed nearly a third of Goku's life. From childhood to a father of two, there's so much growth to not only Goku but those around him. And, anyone who's been alive for a long time knows that change can take a long time. At times, you're left wondering when characters are going to stop with their old habits, or when they're going to finally be strong enough to fight back. All in due time.\
Their character designs are also quite impressive, and I have to admit that I've come to love Akira Toriyama's work. I used to find it a little too cartoony for me but now I miss how unique and recognizable it is. I wish more artists would seek to find their own style rather than imitate so many other types of artwork, especially now in this day where so much looks the same (darn you, moe anime!).\
\
Enjoyment:\
Man, I had a blast! I'm so sad it's over but I'm SO EXCITED to get into the current content. But also, I'm super excited to experience it all over again in the anime adaptions. Although I'll be a little timid about the DBZ adaption (since it's so long and arduous) I'm real excited to watch DBZ Kai and especially Dragon Ball. I watched DBZ as a child but not so much Dragon Ball. And, while GT is abhorred by many, I'd be interested in watching it solely for more Dragon Ball content (despite it's many, many flaws).\
I'm just super hooked on Dragon Ball content, that's all. I want more. But, can you blame me?\

    Yes, I did grow up on Dragon Ball, but I do not cling to it as a infant would their mother's breast. No. I'm being completely unbiased.\
STORY\
Con: the occasional discontinuity and gag scenes. It doesn't take itself seriously enough, such as when Goku bites his opponents. I do understand that Toriyama wishes to remain true to its comical roots, but you have involved aliens and the entire universe INCLUDING HEAVEN AND HELL THEMSELVES with the cast. So as a result of trying to remain true, whenever those gag scenes pop up, they seem really out of place with the rest of the story's atmosphere. Though,\
          \
        part of this humor is creativity, such as the silliness of Gotenks and Buu screaming to create portal back to the regular dimension, which I really enjoyed because it matched with the feel of the scene; Gotenks and Buu, both immature children, using their awesome abilities as childish solutions. I find that there are certain parts where the target demographic humor is a appropriate and when it is not. Though, I suppose it is very relative, as the enjoyment of the gag scenes is dependent on your sense of humor. \
Pro: Toriyama's storytelling technique is classic and the plot goes through a lot of evolution. There is obviously, no way to avoid Dragon Ball being labeled as a \"typical Shounen\" when it is the archetype for Shounen mangas. So I will be using a double standard. For its time, Dragon is highly imaginative and creative, with antics being performed on a regular basis and silly boyish humor.\
Since so much of it is battles, talking about the fight scenes is unavoidable. The unfeasible antics and maneuvers that belonged in a cartoon, but then the fight scenes began to evolve. Of course, the maneuvers remained unfeasible, but as time went on, there was a lot less charge-jump-hit and more grappling between opponents. Then the implantation of ki attacks was absolutely brilliant. The combatants could manipulate its path; they could keep it at bay starting from the very beginning of the fight and use it as their trump card later on, whatever! There were endless possibilities.\
Once the fight scenes got more and more intense, the story followed suit. All of a sudden, the enemies were more capable, they could do just the same things that our heroes could (even more), and sometimes better too. And so, Toriyama crafted opponents around the new abilities he’d given the cast. He also exposed our heroes’ weaknesses and made characters that could and would use the weaknesses to their advantage. So Dragon Ball went from a silly stylistic adaption of an ancient Chinese epic poem to a serious face-to-\
face brawl in which the stakes was the very existence of everything.\
ART\
Con: Toriyama, I get it, you’re a good artist. I know. We all know. It’s plain since you show off through your awesome and completely irrelevant depictions of your characters riding exotic animals or intricately detailed machinery in exotic backgrounds.\
Pro: Why do I need to talk about this? The art evolution is VERY obvious. Take a look at the very first chapter then the latest. The art started off as unpolished and choppy thick lineart and became more angular and fluid and Toriyama started using screen tone too. There’s not much too it.\
CHARACTER\
Con: why the hell did over 80% of your cast stop having character development starting with Gohan’s kidnapping? Seriously. The very first episode of what is known to Americans as Dragon Ball \"Z\", Krillin pretty much gets kicked in the stomach, rolls up into a ball and is utterly useless for an entire season. The next time he proved useful was at the end of the Saiyan arc, and that was only because he was the least injured. Then he fades into the background for the ENTIRE SERIES. After Piccolo gets killed off, he’s useless. Don’t even get me started on Yamcha…oh…poor Yamcha, never useful after Goku hits puberty.\
Pro: the characters Toriyama actually chooses to focus on go through a great deal of development. Especially Goku. The kind-hearted, dense boy lacking any social decency grows up into a gentle, honorable, and wise man, whose ideology inspired the greatest fighters of all time. This is the standard protocol for all of the characters who have any sort of development as they are also befriended and converted into good people. (Goku is quite an effective missionary, just without the official title, haha.)\
ENJOYMENT\
A very relative measurement, but I digress, I quite enjoyed Dragon Ball. It certainly was unique until others jumped onto the bandwagon to make money (I’m looking at you Naruto, One Piece, Bleach.)\
One good thing about Dragon Ball out of them all: the creator had enough balls to end it when he wanted to, so I never really felt like it was dragging.\
OVERALL\
I enjoyed it enough. The manga didn’t have that much filler besides that one mini filler right before Buu arc about Gohan’s high school education. The plot was always progressing, the ones Toriyama chose to work on, he put them through a lot, so the characters grew a lot.\
Dragon Ball is a light hearted yet somewhat serious story that is straight forward, it doesn’t overwhelm you with a bajillion side stories like Naruto or Bleach or One Piece. My only concern is that most readers will overlook the philosophy that the Z-fighters put their lives on the line for, and think it’s a mindless story about sacks of testosterone wrestling one another.\
But I felt that overall, the art, the story and the characters went through a lot of evolution, and such development is missing in modern mangas and would like to see more works like this.",

    Dragon Ball is renowned for being one of the most influential and popular manga of all time. At the same time, however, it's one of the most overrated, owing a lot of it's praise to nostalgia and Toriyama's hard working attitude at the time, rather than it's overall quality.\
Story - 5/10\
There's little to be said about the story that isn't already obvious. The first part of the story follows Son Goku's journeys as a child, but usually only Goku, with the other supporting characters such as Kuririn, Yamcha and Muten Roshi not doing much unless it's the Tenkaichi Budokai. In the 2nd part of the\
          \
        manga, otherwise known as DBZ, practically all the plot is told through battle. Whilst there are a few arcs that are mildly entertaining (Piccolo Daimao and Freeza Arcs) and a fair few that deviate from the story's repetitive structure ever so slightly (Saiyan Arc), the overwhelmingly huge plot holes along the way, primarily after the Freeza Arc help solidify the plot's placement as mediocre at best.\
Art - 5/10\
Toriyama's art style is quite distinctive, especially compared to the mangaka of today, outside of a select few, but when comparing it to the highly detailed peers of DB's run such as Tetsuo Hara, Tsukasa Hojo or Takehiko Inoue, it clearly falls short in the long run. Furthermore, Toriyama pays little heed in fixing artistic mistakes in the re-releases of the manga, such as Goku having the Kame kanji on his gi in a panel in the Cell Arc. Though slightly above most generic works, it's art isn't anything amazing.\
Characters - 5/10\
Most of the characters develop well when taking into account the constraints of the plot, though only a handful do so to a great amount. A lot of the characters do have distinct personalities, though even in the clear archetypes they present, there are far better deliverances of such in other series.\
Enjoyment - 5/10\
The plot of DB is mediocre at best, though makes up for this in being fairly fast paced, in heavy contrast to it's filler heavy anime. However, even in the pros of the series, such as it's action, comedy and designs, it never truly felt top dollar. That's not to say that these aspects are done in an average manner, they were indeed reasons to suggest DB's popularity. However, when comparing it to other series of both it's era, before it and after, it in no way stands at the pinnacle of any category. \
In fact, the only category it may stand near the top on is overration. I'm sure many are familiar with how fanboys tend to treat the series as top tier, whether in terms of character's power or the overall series quality. To this, it should be evident that DB is one of the most notorious examples of fans elevating a series' status beyond it's natural means.\
Overall - 5/10\
Of course, I want to make it clear that I'm in no way hating on this series, especially with the effort Toriyama put into it every day for 11 years, or with it being more commercially successful than most others can only dream of. However, there is no denying how overrated the series can be in the categories that make up a good series. Both by the standards of similar Shonen of it's time, such as Kinnikuman and Saint Seiya, to the series it inspired such as One Piece and Toriko, there's very little room to treat DB as a great manga in a critical view when the quality of so many series dominate it in terms of Plot, Art or Characters. In conclusion, DB is a classic series, but is an average classic.\

    Dragon Ball....now THIS is what I call nostalgia.\
Dragon Ball was the first manga I ever read and finished so of course I'm giving it a 10 all the way through.\
A long time ago in a little settlement in Sweden far, far away...\
There was a kid who is known here as \"Skitungen2\", when he was 9 years old he got the first three volumes of Dragon Ball for birthday from his brother, he had no idea what manga was and he thought that it was wierd that you read right-to-left and didn't get why, he was a somewhat confused kid.\
He also thought that it was awesome\
          \
        that they showed boobs in a book aimed towards boys under 18, and pretty weird that they showed a guys wee-wee in the first chapter, in a book aimed towards boys under 18.\
And then 3 years later when he had all the volumes of Dragon Ball he thought for himself: \"Äntligen så har jag alla volymerna av Dragon Ball\" Translation: \"Finally, I have all the volumes of Dragon Ball.\"\
That confused little kid is me.\
THE END by Skitungen2\
\
Now the review,\
[REMINDER] I will use the names of the characters that I learned from the swedish translation.\
MEDIUM/MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK\
Dragon Ball starts off pretty simple: One guy and one girl is searching for the so-called \"Dragon Balls\", which can grant any wish, no matter what it is.\
The guy who is also known as \"Son-Goku\" has one of those Dragon Balls, his Dragon Ball is a memento from his gramps, and the girl who is also known as \"Bulma\" wants Goku's Dragon Ball, and then the adventure begins.\
I'm too lazy to write more.\
\
The artwork in Dragon Ball has aged well, it looks really good to this day.\
Then again it's Akira Toriyama, the man who did something different with the art, almost every manga reminded a little of Astro Boy (just like Chenoan said).\
\
The characters in Dragon Ball is what makes it one of a kind, for example Kuririn, the bald monk who doesn't have a nose, but thinks that he has a nose, chapter 36 for example.\
Kame-Sennin, the perv who is old as sh*t but still thinks that he can get it on with the younger girls in the series.\
Vegeta, the evil saiyan who has come to exterminate the whole planet Earth but turns into a good guy later in the series.\
\
I enjoyed Dragon Ball like I enjoy a plate with 12 pieces of sushi, and that's saying very much.\
I've re-read the series countless times and still think that it's the best manga out there, if you haven't read it, give it a chance, and if you have read it you should just read it again.\
\
Overall Dragon Ball is part of my childhood, and is IMO still the best manga out there, it may have had it's ups and downs, but considering how young I was when I read this manga it's not something that I have noticed.\
\
See you all later, maybe...\
Puss o kram, alla Barnbarn. Tack för mig!\

    Dragon Ball is good.\
It's not AS good as people would make you believe, but it's good. I've seen and read much worse, but I've also seen and read much better.\
Story: 6 / 10\
You all know this story; Dragon Balls, adventure, Shenron, yadda yadda yadda. The concept of the Dragon Balls itself is pretty interesting, but the story itself kind of drags after a while, the Red Ribbon Army arc especially. I made it to the fight against Ninja Murasaki, and gave up because it just didn't engage me anymore.\
Art: 8 / 10\
Toriyama's drawing style is really good. Shenron looks very majestic and powerful, and the\
          \
        way he's designed looks simply cool. Everything else that isn't a building or a tough fighter is very simplistic, but not in a bad way; the characters still stand out and are very recognizable. Just look at Goku's hair!\
Character: 7 / 10\
Goku might be one of the most endearing characters in Japanese media, and when I was reading I was always curious as to what he was going to do next. However, every other character is either unlikeable, a pervert, or a simple villain, with a few exceptions of course. Krillin for example manages to become quite a likeable character, and I can relate to Yamcha's unability to ask women out.\
Enjoyment: 7 / 10\
If I was still the huge Dragon Ball fan I used to be, I would of given this section a 10, but now the manga is a lot less impressive. The techniques used in every fight are remarkable and very well incorporated, but they're not really enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. The humor however is still as effective as always, and every line or drawing gets at least a chuckle out of me.\
Overall: 7 / 10\
Dragon Ball is still a good read for anyone craving a good adventure with loads and loads of action, but I say it's not as amazing when you look at it objectively. Approach with caution.\

    Ah Dragon ball one of my favorite battle shonen manga. Okay Okay lets get right into detail.\
But despite that it fairly overrated\
Story: 7\
Dragon balls story isn't anything really deep or thought provoking its simplistic but its still pretty good.\
Dragon ball is about a action journey of our protagonist Son goku and he explores the world meeting new people and getting stronger and somewhat wiser along the way Part 1 was a blast and a great adventure with lots of great characters and action. Then we have part 2 were goku learns about his past as a saiyan and encountering various enemies that threaten him and\
          \
        his friends but either way this is were the quality of the series goes down hill it doesn't take a massive nose dive but there a lot of problems in it from the over exaggerated fights to side characters slowly becoming irrelevant but despite that even though theses arcs in Z arent better then DB the first 3 arcs are pretty darn good Especially the cell saga which is the best in the Z seires. (Also the dragon balls are a huge plot device my god)\
Art: 9\
Akira toriyama artwork truly shines in the progression of the series. its highly sylistic artwork pulls you into the story and world that is dragon ball and its very addicting to look at.\
Characters: 8\
Many characters in dragon ball go through lots of development in part 1 more than part 2 but there all enjoyable and you grow attached to them ie. Characters like Gohan, Krillin, piccolo, Vegeta and the majority of the cast were definition of how to make good and fun characters there grows in the series makes you admire them from thier motivations to the sacrifices they make.Also forgot to mention their comedic moments makes it all the more enjoyable.  So Overall the characters are a charm to have around\
Enjoyment: 9 \
Dragon ball is one of those manga's even if you dont like or think it mediorce is something you cant deny you heavily enjoyed especially me cause i enjoyed this series alot from the great martial art action, to the emotional attachment to characters, to straight up funny moments in the series which i why i just crave it.\
Overall: 8\
Despite my gushing praise for the series i will saying that i didnt like how things in the story didnt make sense despite its simplicity and at time toriyama could've done much better but that just that but in general dragon ball is an amazing series that has helped me get deeper in to manga and anime.\

    What can you say about Dragon Ball?  Almost everyone knows it even people outside the community. With the FANTASTIC artwork and character development, there is no other definition of this manga than a MASTERPIECE. You will get hooked on this amazing and comedic series about Son Goku and his friends training and fighting to save the earth. I personally loved the beginning when Goku was still a kid and  an idiot. I then got hooked onto the second part when Goku got married and had a son. I read over hundreds of chapters in a single day. This series with its amazing appealing\

    Just saying, this is my first review. I have read lots of manga after reading this one but I'm saving my first review for the first manga i read. Dragonball introduced me to the world of manga. Considering the fact I'm a girl, I now prefer romantic manga, but even from a girls point of view, this is actually really good. The first series Dragonball is more comedy. The other 2 are both comedy and a bit more drama. It would have been nice to learned a bit more of the lives of further characters. This also made me cry for some reason at the\
          \
        end, which is kind of ridiculous. Anyway, this is a great manga whether you just started or already read hundreds of mangas. I also recomend watching the anime if you enjoy reading it because there is a further series only in anime called Dragonball GT.\

    I LUV this manga. I originally read the Dragon Ball Z half first and went back later to read the Dragon Ball half and I have to say that the first half had this child-like, playful tone to it compared to the more serious nature of Dragon Ball Z but I love how well it transitioned. \
In the first half, it's seen virtually from the eyes of a really powerful kid as he travels around with friends he meets along the way in search of 7 ballls that grant 1 wish when gathered together. This kid is Goku and let me tell you, he's naive,\
          \
        he's oblivious, he's cocky, he's childish, and he's a bit of a show off, but all his flaws are what make him likable because time and again, he'll notice his flaws and overcome them as if they were a pebble in his shoe. He's so young and opitmistic that it's contageous and you can't help but root for him to get back up and keep trying. The other characters are a RIOT! Krillin, Roshi, Bulma, Lunch, gut-busting everytime and the motives or personalities of the villains are so petty (with the exception of the Picolo's) it's too much NOT to laugh. The art is simple but suitable and every once in a while, they'll throw in a 4th wall (panel) joke. The Dragon Ball half really captures it from the eyes of a kid and thet's refreshing every once in a while.\
In the Z half, the tone gets more serious as Goku grows and matures but he still has that innocence about him. When new, more powerful, and far more serious villains show up, the lives of more innocent people are sacrificed and that number grew with each new villain. Even though you know they'd bring all them back with the Dragon Balls (which, by the way, have been reduced to a meeger plot device as the story progresses), the fact that they were up against people who could erase planets with a flick of the finger as opposed to King Picolo's destroy-one-city-anually plan, you were scared for them. Our favorite heroes fought honorably and died many times and you were TORN to see it. But what I love is that even though you could say there was a happy ending, there technically wasn't. It was happy but there seems to be no end as you see Goku fly of into another adventure as the Acknowledgements show up.\
Overall, this was a good manga and for those just planning to read certain parts like I did, chapter 194 is the separater fyi. I may never get the chance to redo my childhood (as I am a 90's girl but missed out due to parental units eg. mother-censorship) and watch the anime but I'm glad I at least got to see the original in all it's glory.\

    Hello, this is my first review on MAL, and I thought I’d talk about one of the classics. I avoided watching the famous anime that literally everyone I ever knew personally watched just so I can experience it the same way that the Japanese first did in 1984- through the original manga. So let’s dive into it…\
Well as for the art, it’s still great. Toriyama’s art is cartoony but rich in detail at the same time. It definitely holds up after over 30 years.\
I love how the series is off-the-wall funny along with the fast pacing and the intensity of the battles. Yeah, I just\
          \
        called this manga \"fast-paced\". The anime was notorious for many scenes where it would take several episodes for someone to launch a single attack. Well, in this it does take a few chapters to do and back when it came out in Japan they had to wait one week for each chapter. But nowadays, with the full series complete and able to be read through all in succession, there isn’t really a problem here. \
Oh, and I also called the fights \"intense\". Despite how goofy this series is, I found myself sweating in a lot of the combat scenes, especially in the classic Tenkaichi Budokai arcs. It was all invigorating stuff. All the way up to the end, I never thought the fights themselves were bad. Although I’d argue that’s the only constant \"good\" throughout the series. And now for my complaints...\
I’m willing to argue that volumes 17-42 (sorry, I’m counting them by their actual volume number, not when Viz reset the counter and stuck a Z onto the end of it), which were the basis for the mammothly popular Dragon Ball Z that every kid in my generation other than me grew up with, are weaker than the previous 16 volumes.\
Okay, first complaint: the characters. I liked pretty much everyone in the first 16 volumes (even Yamcha). I wasn’t emotionally attached to them like with the cast of One Piece or Boku no Hero, but I liked them enough to care. Most of them carry over to Z, but they might as well not have. Goku, and one other are the only returning characters who matter. EVERYONE ELSE is useless. Although the fights are still great by themselves, this aspect still bothered me to death.\
My other big complaint is that I think the manga has overstayed its welcome. I think the series would’ve ended perfectly at the arc covered from volume 21 up to some point in volume 28. But it didn’t, and I honestly didn't care too much about whatever happened after that. It's not as bad as the final arc in Fairy Tail, but it's still pretty bad.\
If this manga went on for any longer than volume 42, I would’ve probably stopped liking it, which is why I have no interest at all in Super. But nonetheless, the action and pacing stay solid for all 42 volumes, and I recommend that you read this because it’s better than the anime and it’s a classic that you should read at least for educational purposes.\

    I would like to preface this by stating this will be my first review of many to come.  I decided to choose Dragon Ball because it is a series near and dear to me as is with thousands, tens of thousands, yet probably more.  With that said, let's take a look at one of the most celebrated works of art in manga, and the artistic world as a whole.\
NOTE:  For the sake of being fair to the series, I am ignoring Super for the time being.  This is strictly Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z\
If you lived in the 90s, chances\
          \
        are you have tried to fire off a Kamehameha wave at least once and likely to no avail.  This isn't to call up one of the over-done \"90s kids cliches\", but there is no other way to call how influential and defining the Dragon Ball franchise was for an entire generation.\
You may be looking at the ratings and raising an eyebrow at the numbers, but let's look at this franchise objectively.  The story is the series weakest point.  Even for it's time it hits all of the formulaic beats that is expected for a 'battle' manga, not to mention it's riddled with numerous deus ex machina plot points that only get more and more exaggerated as time goes on.  It's most egregious offense is that there is simultaneously a great importance placed on power levels and strength that mean nothing after a single tide-turning event that is dubious at best.  There is nothing that is inherently offensive, but when you look at it objectively the story is average at best.  Imagine if the story continued with the same tone is had during the first few volumes in Dragon Ball.\
Are you doing all right?  Calmed down?  It's difficult to hear something negative about Dragon Ball, but let's keep our composure.  It gets better.\
Despite having a weak story, Dragon Ball is still carried by its genius art style by Akira Toriyama and the diverse and interesting characters.  Now, let's get this out in the open.  Every character exhibits standard Akira Toriyama face structure.  Take away the character frame, clothes, and hair, there are only three faces left; male, female, and animal.  To compensate for this, every character is fully fleshed out with immediately identifiable features and personalities to distinguish themselves.\
The beautiful art does not end solely on the characters.  The battles and action scenes are fully fleshed out in the highest of detail.  Every scene perfectly conveys the intensity and emotion of the situation.  Looking strictly at the manga, the true impressiveness comes from the panel layout.  This is admittedly a very technical aspect of the process, but it is one of the most important arts that is not appreciated.  Each panel expertly lends itself to the next making it incredibly easy to picture the scenes coming to life in your mind.\
So the art is terrific and the story is mediocre.  Where does the magic come from then?  Why is this series so critically acclaimed and fondly remembered?  The obvious answer is that it's largely nostalgia.  This series exists inside the heart of many individuals and witnessing its greatness forces you to revert to when you were only the playground trying to go Super Saiyan.  If it were just that it would fade into the annals of history like many others, but the reason it remains at the top is hard to describe, but the best way to explain it would be it is sincere and honest.  Dragon Ball knows exactly what it is and what it wants to be.  It is that charm that makes it so that new fans can easily come on board and the old fans are happy to relive it.\

    One of the first manga I can remember reading. I loved watching the americanized version of this TV show after school on Cartoon Network. I was exposed to anime very young through my dad, but it wasn't until Dragonball and Dragonball Z that I found manga. For that reason Dragonball and Dragonball Z will always be important and unique for me.\
Growing up I preferred DBZ, the villains looked cooler (although King Piccolo is a badass in Dragonball), and the anime was longer and full of more powerful characters. But looking back now, Dragonball is closer to my heart, and I appreciate it more as a\
          \
        manga. The battles seem more tactics oriented- rather than power level oriented as with DBZ. There is also an element of character progression for Goku that just isn't there to the same extent in DBZ. Dragonball was also my first exposure to tournaments in shounen- which are super awesome!\
I love you Dragonball, and I love you Akira Toriyama!\

    The DB anime adaptation was the first piece of Japanese animation I ever saw back in the 90s, so I felt it fitting to make it the manga I first read all the way through. \
It's aged better than both DB and DBZ anime with no old animation and dodgy voice acting with Toriyama's art still looking good and the manga moves at a much better pace without fillers and dragging the fights out. It's one of the better shounen series (better than most modern ones) with great character designs and fighting techniques. One of the things I like most about DB was how it\
          \
        gradually changed from a gag manga into an action fantasy comedy and then into a serious sci-fi action series. \
If DG had ended at the Namek arc I would probably bump it up to an 8/10 or 9/10 but the Cell arc jumps the shark and brings the quality down with constant asspulls, characters becoming flanderized, fights being purely about power with no strategy involved, non-saiyan characters becoming irrelevant, the super saiyan which was supposed to be a once in millennia legend becoming a normal power up for every fighter etc It's just filled with those annoying problems that arise in shounen when the mangaka runs out of ideas. \
Anyway, the two weak arcs at the end don't ruin the rest of Dragon Ball, and it's better than most of the modern fighting shounen that copy it. I think it's a series everyone should read once because of how iconic and influential it became. \

 Bulma is originally a secondary main character, but her role is quickly downplayed as the series continues, even though she does remain an important support character for most of the series. Bulma is a direct parody of the character Xuanzang from the Chinese novel Journey to the West. Even though Bulma's character parodies a monk, her Japanese name \"Buruma\" is the brand of a popular gym short worn by girls in Japan. Her re-adapted name Bulma is a direct take on the word \"bloomers\", which was a popular brand of women's underwear in the early 20th century.\
 \
 Bulma is the second character to be introduced in the Dragon Ball series. In the early part of the story, she is the inventor of the Dragon Radar and is searching for the legendary Dragon Balls. Bulma was hoping to use the Dragon Balls to wish for the perfect boyfriend. While searching for a nearby Dragon Ball, she runs into Son Goku. It is at this time that she finds out Goku inherited one of the balls (the four-star ball) she is searching for from his Grandpa Gohan. Because of Goku's love for the ball and his belief that his Grandpa's spirit lives in the ball, Goku is not willing to give it up. Bulma then asks him to loan it for her in exchange of taking him in her travels. At that point, they team up to find the remainder of the balls and the adventure begins. In the later action-oriented episodes of the series, there is little room for a genius but Bulma continues to play a role as a secondary character, helping Goku and his friends with her gadgets, and having a rather rocky relationship with Yamcha.\

 Piccolo is a fictional character from the Dragon Ball metaseries. He is considered both the son and reincarnation of Demon King Piccolo and was spawned to save himself from certain death at the hands of Son Goku. Like his father, he appears as a tall green humanoid creature with pointy ears; he is later revealed to be part of an alien race known as the Namekians. \
 \
 Piccolo is first consumed with revenge against Goku, and elects to defeat and kill him during the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. After his narrow defeat against Goku, Piccolo is soon forced to form an at first uneasy alliance with Goku and his friends against newer, more dangerous threats like the Saiyans and Freeza. Out of necessity he also takes it upon himself to train Goku's child Son Gohan, forming a bond which is strengthened when he sacrifices himself to save the child's life against Nappa. After his resurrection, he fully joins Goku and the others in their struggles against ever more powerful villains.\
 \
 Piccolo still retains elements of ruthlessness and cockiness, but once he fuses with Kami, all traces of evil and hate disappear, and Piccolo is completely reborn as a pure soul. Piccolo remains a loner, preferring to stand apart from others. He has little to say unless it involves battle, but he normally can still retain his stoic and calm personality in everyday, normal situations. Piccolo has shown to have intelligence, such as when he gathered strength to regenerate his arm after Cell had drained it, or when he elected to kill Babidi since he knew leaving him alive wouldn't solve the problem of Buu. His intelligence is even picked up on Buu, who later absorbs him for his fine brain.\
 \
 Piccolo's character development entails him changing from a villain hell-bent on revenge on Goku and controlling the world to becoming a better person who is capable of caring about other people, like Gohan and Goku. He's also showed some interest in learning about his Namekian heritage, and has a good affinity with kids, as he trained Gohan for a year, helped Goten and Trunks to learn Fusion\
 and is even seen humorously rocking Pan to sleep in <i>Fukkatsu no F</i>. He also acts as a confidant for Dende, who is a younger Namekian and is tasked with watching over Earth (Piccolo is able to impart the wisdom he gained from fusing with Kami, as Kami was the previous placeholder of Dende's current occupation).\

 Gohan is a main character in the <i>Dragon Ball</i> series by Akira Toriyama and is the dual main character of <i>Dragon Ball Z</i> along with his father, Goku.\
 \
 Gohan is a shy and studious intellectual, and as a child lacks the fighting spirit that is common among most Saiyans. However, because he is forced to protect the ones he loves, he taps into his vast half-breed Saiyan potential, becoming one of the most powerful main characters in the series. As an adult, he abandons his superhero duties and uses his mind, as a premier scholar. Gohan is extremely powerful, sometimes surpassing Gokuu, Piccolo and Vegeta at certain points in the story.\
 \
 At first, the relationship with Piccolo is a frightening one, but after Piccolo saves Gohan's life from Nappa at the cost of his own, Piccolo admits his change because of Gohan's acceptance of him during the 1 year they were training together. From here on out, Piccolo acts as an uncle (oji-san in the Japanese version) to Gohan. Krillin also acted as a strong confidant in Gohan, particularly during the Namek arc and the beginning of the Buu arc.\
 \
 Gohan also shares a strong relationship with his father in Gokuu, citing his walking up to Freeza on Namek as a source of inspiration and strength. He also spends to close to a full year just with him in the Room of Spirit and Time during the Androids arc, and the two really get to enjoy each other's company. Gohan's respect and love for his father is all the more shown when he elects to wear Goku's orange gi when he sets off to fight Buu.\
 \
 His hobbies are reading, fishing, and researching scholarly subjects. Though he claims he does not share the love of fighting Gokuu has, Gohan does feel obligated to help when danger arrives. He also enjoys being a hero, as seen by his comedic and unimpressive Great Saiyaman stunt. Another prominent facet of his personality was the fear of his own great potential power, which was seen when he was afraid that he might kill Cell during their battle in the Androids arc.\

 Originally named Kakarot, Gokuu is born a member of a race of extraterrestrials called the Saiyans. Shortly following his birth, Gokuu is sent from his native planet Vegeta to Earth, for potential selling on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life; Goku was also sent away to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Once he lands on Earth, he is adopted by an old man named Gohan (who is later just called Grandpa Gohan). At first, Goku is very violent as a kid due to his Saiyan blood, but due to an injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, Gokuu changes to a more tempered, innocent boy. At the start of the series, Gokuu meets Bulma, Yamucha, Oolong, and Pu'ar, whose characters mirror those found in Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West. He also encounters Kuririn, who eventually becomes his best friend, and others during his journey for more strength. Participating in several World Martial Arts Tournaments, Gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as Tenshinhan and Chaozu, as well as the offspring of Demon King Piccolo named Majunior (later, he's named just Piccolo).\
 \
 Dragon Ball Z takes place 5 years after Gokuu's victory against Piccolo in the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. He now has a son named Son Gohan (named after Grandpa Gohan) who lacks his father's love of fighting but has a great hidden potential himself. Throughout the series, Gokuu & Gohan face terribly strong opponents like other powerful Saiyans, a space tyrant, artificial humans, Majins & Gods that threaten Earth while also giving them exhilarating fights. Along with new enemies, they also gain new friends that help in these situations. As well as becoming more powerful, Gokuu learns to accept his forgotten Saiyan heritage (this gives him a small identity crisis when Raditz reveals his past, and is something he carries with him into the proceeding Namek arc) & consistently comes across the predicament of killing an opponent (he starts out killing without much thought to the moral consequences of taking a life, and only after training under Kami does he start to struggle with killing a person; this comes to a head when he fights Freeza on Namek).\
 \
 In <i>Dragon Ball GT</i>, which is not based on Toriyama's manga, Gokuu is turned into a child by Pilaf via the Black-Star Dragon Balls. The series revolves around him traveling around space to find the Black Star Dragon Balls with the help of his granddaughter Pan and Trunks. After collecting the spheres, Gokuu does battle with Baby (a Tuffle who wants revenge on all Saiyans for killing his race), Super 17 (a powered-up version of former enemy Artificial Human 17) and various Evil Dragons (the physical constructs of negative energy accumulated in the Dragon Balls; they are called Shadow Dragons in FUNimation's dub). The series ends with Gokuu leaving for good with Shenron and returning 100 years later to witness the match between Gokuu Jr. and Vegeta Jr.\
 \
 In <i>Dragon Ball Online</i> (which takes place 216 years after <i>Dragon Ball Z</i>, in which Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story, unlike <i>Dragon Ball GT</i>), a new villain by the name of Miira appears with the goal to obtain Gokuu's DNA.\
 \
 In <i>Cross Epoch</i>, the <i>Dragon Ball</i> and <i>One Piece</i> crossover one-shot, Gokuu is seen accompanying Luffy to attend a party hosted by Shenron from whom key characters from both series had received an invitation.\
 \
 In <i>Dragon Ball Minus</i>, it is revealed that Gokuu was sent away by his mother and father (Gine & Bardock) to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Gokuu leaves Planet Vegeta in his pod with a forlorn look as his parents send him away.\
 \
 Gokuu is known for his laid-back personality and his love of fighting worthy opponents. He will eat anything without much qualms. He has an uncanny ability to make allies out of foes he has fought (in some cases to the death), though his capacity for sparing his enemies has occasionally been criticized as foolish (Gokuu generally only fights to win and improve himself, and spares his enemies after winning only for them to attack him when his back is turned). Gokuu can also be very blunt, and not afraid to express his opinion in a discussion, such as when he questioned Krillin's marriage to Android 18 (who was not fully human and a previous enemy who threatened his life). Despite his kind-hearted nature, Gokuu can feel incredible anger in cases of extreme turmoil, such as the death of a close friend/relative, or when someone murders many innocents needlessly. He has a simple, practical view of the world and is somewhat naive to the world around him. Because of this, many characters incorrectly assume him to be somewhat stupid, although once he has a basic understanding of things, he learns very quickly. His most remarkable ability is his will to succeed, his tenacity and persistence.\
 \
 He's so focused on improving himself as a warrior that some of the decisions he makes are detrimental to the survival of humanity or those who he cares about. Such examples include when he purposefully chose not to help his friends and family when they were attacked by Beerus at Bulma's birthday so as to study his opponent, or when he elected not to destroy Gero's lab in favor of his curiosity at his potential opponents' strength even though it might've meant the destruction of mankind. This is also touched upon when he spares Vegeta for a rematch in the Saiyan arc, despite this also being a threat to humanity. However, he has shown to be able to slightly curb this selfishness, as he elected to not return to life after dying in the fight against Cell so that Earth would not be endangered by the evil people he tends to attract (although, Goku is also interested in fighting the masters in the afterlife indicating some slight selfishness was still apparent). \
 \
 Goku has also admitted to not being good at creating things, and being better at breaking stuff at the end of <i>Dragon Ball Kai</i>. In <i>Dragon Ball Super</i> Ep. 4, Goku is revealed not to be much of a party-goer. He has also shown an affinity with training younger kids (like how he did with Gohan in the Androids arc, Goten & Trunks in the Buu arc, and Uub at the end of the series).\

 Vegeta is a fictional character from the manga series Dragon Ball, created by Akira Toriyama.\
 \
 Along with Goku, Gohan and Piccolo, he is one of the most prominent characters in the series, originally starting out as a villain before becoming a mainstay hero.\
 \
 Vegeta starts out haughty, arrogant, self-entitled and ruthless as the prince of Saiyans. His royal status caused him to develop an inflated sense of superiority and he holds himself above most, if not all people he encounters. Regal, egotistical and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless, cold-blooded warrior and outright killer. However, as the story unfolds, he changes to a person capable of caring about and loving someone other than himself.\
 \
 Vegeta was once a young member of the Saiyan army, but after his race's demise, he worked alongside Nappa and Raditz, directly under Freeza. He seeks immortality to rule the universe, but once he learns about Freeza destroying his planet from Dodoria, he resolves to take out Freeza (not to avenge his race, but to assure his own rule over the universe as well as to get back at Freeza for unknowingly using him to further his own goals). He later battles Freeza with the main cast on Namek and dies in the ensuing fights; once he is revived, he returns to Earth, where he adjusts to everyday life and remains there for good.\
 \
 In <i>Cross Epoch</i> (the <i>Dragon Ball</i> and <i>One Piece</i> crossover one-shot) Vegeta is the captain of an air ship and is seen wearing an eye patch and a cape with a clasp featuring the Kanji character for \"vegetable.\" Trunks, Usopp and Nico Robin are members of his crew.\

Babidi's mental abilities are very powerful, surpassing those of various mystical individuals who reside in Other World such as the telepathic North Kaio, and illusionist Princess Snake. After Buu is released, Vegeta nearly kills Babidi when trying to destroy Buu. When Buu is seemingly destroyed, Piccolo bisects Babidi and leaves him for dead. After Buu revives himself, he finds Babidi who then orders Buu to revive him. Babidi orders Buu to kill Dabura, Kaioshin, Gohan, Piccolo, Goten, Trunks, Vegeta (before his sacrifice) and whoever else stands in his way. As Buu is very disobedient, Babidi can only control him by threatening to seal him up. After an encounter with Super Saiyan 3 Goku, Buu learns that he is stronger than Babidi. Realizing this, Buu strangles Babidi (so Babidi can't say the spell to seal him up), and then punches his head off in rebellion. Babidi is seen in hell with Cell and Freeza but wanted the Z fighters to win after having created a grudge against Majin Buu.\

His name is a pun on \"burdock\" (バードック, bādokku?), a herb. While the Viz manga and FUNimation's Japanese-language English-subtitled anime both use \"Burdock\", FUNimation's English anime dubs uses \"Bardock\", and some Japanese merchandise even use \"Barduck\". \
 The biological father of Raditz and Son Goku, Burdock is a Saiyan who is given the gift of precognition. In several of his recurring visions, he witnesses the destruction of his home planet Vegeta by the hand of Freeza. After escaping certain death from Dodoria, he tries desperately to change his planet's grim future by attempting to combat Freeza and his legion of men head on. He ultimately fails on ceasing Freeza's attack on the planet and is killed in the process. Moments before his death, he received a vision of his son facing the warlord. According to the anime special, Burdock was estimated a battle power of 10,000 by observant doctors while recovering from his last mission.  \

 Chi-Chi (チチ, Chichi) is the wife of Son Goku, and the mother of Son Gohan and Son Goten. She is often depicted as a sometimes nagging, overprotective but fundamentally well-meaning woman, who sincerely looks for her children and husband's well-being even when their views clash. She and Goku meet as children, and Goku promises to marry her thinking marriage is food. Several years later, she finds him at the 23rd Tenkaichi Budoukai, and despite confessing that he misunderstood what she had meant, he fulfills his promise and asks her to marry him. As she gets older, she disapproves of Goku's lifestyle, enough to ban Gohan from following in his foot steps, but due to the threats like Vegeta and Freeza, she is forced to let him train under Piccolo and Goku. She relaxes this with Goten by training him herself while Gohan is away for school. She has a wild temper and can react in violent anger over the slightest annoyance which means all of the Z Warriors fear her and try to avoid making her mad.\

When first introduced Chiaotzu is a student of the Crane Hermit (a rival of Master Roshi) and the constant companion of fellow student Tien; he quickly amends his ways though and joins Goku and his friends. While not outstanding in physical prowess compared to other superhuman warriors in Dragon Ball, Chiaotzu has considerable potency in psionics, especially in psychokinesis. Chiaotzu is not very well educated, as shown in the Tien Shinhan Saga. There was one part where Krillin was called \"squid\" due to his shaved head. Krillin angered and said that Chiaotzu was also a bald. But Chiaotzu took off his cap, revealling ONE hair on top of his head (which makes Krillin very angry). Chiaotzu lost the battle in the 22nd Martial Arts Tournament by Krillin's maths knowledge. \
 Chiaotzu's importance in the series rapidly diminishes after his introduction in the Tenshinhan Saga, where he is a major character. He is a minor character in the subsequent Demon King Piccolo, Piccolo Junior and Vegeta sagas, and is more-or-less a background character for the others. Chiaotzu also has a prominent role in the Dragon Ball movie \"Mystical Adventure\".\

      firstname = "Colonel Silver",
      description = "Colonel Silver is the first of the high-ranking Red Ribbon Army officers Goku fights, and thus is overwhelmed and unprepared. \
 He is shown to be a talented, powerful fighter with a love of weapons, and excellent in marksmanship as well. As evident in both the anime and the manga on multiple occasions, unlike most officers, he doesn't immediately turn to violence and threats in order to get information, but rather simply asks a couple questions and only resorts to physical means if he's not getting the requested answers. Colonel Silver is also rather fast, shocking even Goku when he runs past and swipes the bundle of cloth containing the Dragon Balls and Dragon Radar from Goku's hands.\
 \
 Colonel Silver had a fairly small role in the Manga, but he had a considerably larger role in the Anime. This is because the Red Ribbon Army was introduced a little earlier in the Anime and Toei created several filler episodes involving Colonel Silver and Emperor Pilaf before the next chapter of the Dragon Ball manga was released and the animators could continue on with the story.\
 \
 The anime, much like they did with Colonel Violet, gave Colonel Silver a lot more characterisation. One thing to note about this character is the strange fact that his personality warps with each Dub, despite no one making any alterations to the animation whatsoever.\
 \
 In the Japanese Dub, Colonel Silver is portrayed as being quiet and serious, in the FUNimation Dub, he changes to being short-tempered, aggressive, and courteous to superiors and occasionally complimentary towards random citizens. In the French Dub he is assertive, in the Castilian Dub he is irritable and foul-tempered, whereas, in a contradiction to all, the Portuguese Dub, he is incapable of becoming angry, and is understanding and patient.\
 \
 In the manga, Commander Red said he was going to be executed for his failure, but that scene is never shown. In the anime, Colonel Silver is called back to the Red Ribbon base for questioning. Colonel Silver begs for a second chance, but Commander Red replies that there are no second chances in the Red Ribbon Army. He orders the guards to take him out of his sight, but Colonel Silver brushes them off. He than calmly walks out the door. Though the fact that Commander Red sends two guards after him suggests that he was executed off-screen shortly after being dismissed. It is unknown if he escaped alive and still lived up until the end of Dragon Ball GT, as he was not seen at all in the Super 17 Saga when all villains escaped from Hell. \

 He fights Gohan in both his normal and Super Saiyan forms to gather energy for Buu, but before they can finish, he notices Vegeta has evil within him. During the fight Vegeta shows great frustration which comes from the fact that Gohan has to make an effort to kill Dabura even though Gohan is still more powerful than Dabura. This spawns from the fact Gohan has not trained at all in the past 7 years and is only slightly more than half as strong as he was when he fought Perfect Cell. This allows Babidi to grant him power. When Buu is released, Dabura tries to kill him, but is turned into a cookie and devoured by Buu. (Upon his death in the anime, King Yamma decides that the usual punishment of exile to Hell is what Dabura would actually desire, so he instead sends him to the most peaceful region of Heaven.) In the anime, Dabura is later seen wandering as a \"good-spirited\" soul consumed with love (creeping out anyone who meets him).\
 It is mentioned by Goku that Dabura's power is equal to Perfect Cell's.  \

 When Majin Buu comes to the planet, Dai Kaioshin manages to save the East Kaioshin from Buu's attack and unleashes a powerful attack of his own that blasts Buu into pieces. However, the Dai Kaioshin gets absorbed seconds later. After the Dai Kaioshin was absorbed, Buu takes a form that looks remarkably similar to Dai Kaioshin. This \"fat\" Buu would continue to show the Dai Kaioshin's spirit within him and later even becomes Mr. Satan's friend. The Dai Kaioshin's presence within Buu pacifies him.\

Once he activated them, they quickly rebelled on their creator. #17 kicked his head off and crushed it. \
 [spoiler]After the Red Ribbon Army was defeated by Goku, Dr. Gero goes into hiding in his laboratory located in a mountain area north of North City. In this lab, he strives to create the ultimate fighting machine. Using an extremely intelligent tracking device disguised as a ladybug, he studies Goku and the Z Fighters for years, observing the fights Goku has with Tien Shinhan, King Piccolo, Piccolo, and the Saiyans Raditz, Nappa and Vegeta.\
 \
 Dr. Gero ceases the study of Goku's power when the Saiyan leaves for Namek, believing he had already compiled enough information; so he simply adjusts the androids' power levels to accommodate for Goku's expected power increase, not accounting for the power level of Goku's Super Saiyan form. Believing he had created the ultimate fighting machines, he finalizes his plans and constructed a series of Androids. Android 16 was modeled on Gero's dead son, a high-ranking Red Ribbon soldier long ago felled by an enemy bullet. In his affection, Gero made him powerful, but did not want him to be destroyed in battle, so he made him gentle. While looking for fresh material for his experiments, Dr. Gero meets two notorious delinquents by chance, two siblings, a boy and a girl. He then kidnaps them and restructures them into Android 17 and Android 18. However, the two became rebellious as they retain their human free will, so he deactivated them. In Dragon Ball GT, he helped Dr. Myu create Super 17, who later went on to kill both of them.\

He is one of the most powerful major supervillains introduced throughout the Dragon Ball universe. In the gag series Neko Majin Z, it is revealed that he has a son, Kuriza. \

Frieza creates armies from the planets that he conquers, his most utilized race were the Saiyans.

Guru is renowned for saving the Namekian race after the climate shift, by laying eggs and continuing his species.

 Though Guru is not shown fighting in the series, he has shown a number of abilities. As a member of the Dragon Clan, his most famous ability is the power to create Dragon Balls, to which he gave powerful abilities.

 Originally a human, he is constructed into a cyborg by Dr. Gero like his twin sister. 17 is a mass murderer in Future Trunks' timeline.\
 \
 Number 17 is not an android created by Dr. Gero. He and his twin sister #18, were once human. How could they be twins if they weren't once human? Toriyama said Gero found them as a couple of hooligans. They existed before Dr. Gero, therefore, they are not robots. An android is a robot and a cyborg is a human with robot parts in them. Considering what he can do, #17 is probably about half human.\
 \
 Now as to the motivation behind #17 killing Dr. Gero, that's subjective. While they didn't necessarily like being turned into cyborgs, once it was done, it couldn't be undone. It was Dr. Gero's strangle hold on their freedom, as represented by the \"controller\" device, that inspired #17 to kill him. Threat + Rebel = dead Gero. They were both rebels. You should never try to put a leash on a rebel.\
 \
 Later, #17 and #18 drive around in a van with Android 16, looking for Goku. When they finally get to the Kame House, Piccolo tells them Goku is not there. He refuses to tell them where he went to, and thus Piccolo challes #17 to a battle. As they fight, Piccolo's ki leads Cell (an evil insect freak spawned by Dr. Gero's computer who needs to absorb #17 and #18 to reach its perfect form) to the battlefield. He offers #17 to surrender so he can become a part of *greatness*. #17 refuses, and is defeated during the battle.\
 \
 Number 17 is killed when Cell explodes, but is wished back to life along with the other people on Earth who had been killed by Cell. #17 has his explosive device removed by Kuririn with the second wish. The last time we see #17 in DBZ is when he is in the woods donating energy for Goku's Genki-Dama. Considering the fact that he is alive during the Kid Buu saga serves as a testament to his good soul: the wish that revived him was one that Vegeta made asking for only the good people on Earth to be revived when it was restored (Kid Buu had previously obliterated the planet in a single attack).\
 \
 He later returns as one of the ten members of the Universe 7 team in Dragon Ball Super,  and ends up sacrificing himself to hold back Jiren. \

 A cybernetic human, #18 modified by Dr. Gero. She is often referred to in the original Japanese as a jinzōningen, which literally translates as \"artificial human\". She is not entirely an android; she refers to both herself and her twin brother as having been \"constructed from a human base\".\
 \
 After Cell is defeated, Kuririn uses the Dragon Balls to wish for #17 and #18 to be turned into humans; Shenlong is unable to perform this task because of the unfathomable differences in power between him and the duo, so he wishes instead for their self destruct devices to be removed. Kuririn pursues #18 and, at some point, they marry and have a daughter named Marron.\
 \
 To clear up the heavily espoused misconception that #18 is a pure android and therefore could not have a child, Kuririn went on to explain to Son Goku during the World Tournament Saga that she was originally human but that Dr. Gero just \"remodeled her a little bit.\"\

 In \"Dragon Ball Full Color: Artificial Humans & Cell Arc Volume #03,\" Akira Toriyama revealed that: \"The model for No. 19 was a doll that was displayed in the command center of an enemy base. Way back when, Dr. Gero took it back with him as a war trophy.\"\
 \
 Though not particularly strong, he managed to beat Goku in battle due to the heart virus that he had contracted. 19 almost killed Goku by draining him of his energy, but he was interrupted by Vegeta who proceeded to beat him with little effort. Vegeta then transformed into a Super Saiyan and started taunted him mercilessly and asked him if androids feel fear. After 19 had his energy absorbing hands torn off by Vegeta, he tried to flee in fear only to be vaporized by Vegeta's \"big bang attack\" leaving nothing but his head behind.\

 In Dragon Ball GT, everyone escapes from Hell and Android 19 is among them. He is easily defeated by energy blasts from Son Goten and Trunks, the son of Vegeta.\

He has served every other Kami (God/Guardian) of the Earth since the beginning of time. He was trained by the recent Kami himself and trained Goku for 3 years in order to fight Piccolo. \
 Mr. Popo is an excellent martial arts master. When he is introduced in Dragon Ball, his fighting prowess is far superior to Goku's in nearly all respects, when the two meet at the Lookout.\
 \
 Mr. Popo and Kami train Krillin, Tien Shinhan, Yamcha, Chiaotzu and Yajirobe in order to help combat the approaching threat of the Saiyans, through many different training methods, including the Pendulum Room, intending to show the full power even the lower class Saiyans used to possess. Mr. Popo and Kami come to the realization that Piccolo has become far less evil than he was five years ago, when they notice that Raditz's soul, who was killed by Piccolo, did not become lost like other souls killed by demons.\
 \
 \
 Mr. Popo appears again in the Imperfect Cell Saga, bidding Kami a final farewell when Kami permanently fuses with Piccolo to become the Nameless Namek, in order to gain more power to combat the Androids who are wishing to murder Goku.\
 \
 When Buu escapes from the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Mr. Popo and the rest are turned into chocolate and eaten. However, before he was turned into chocolate, after seeing the murders of Android 18 and her daughter, Popo bravely makes a quick decision, seizing Dende and hurling him off of the lookout, out of Buu's rampage. He is commended for his bravery by Piccolo, when the Namek comes across the surviving Dende.\

 Pan is a fictional character in the manga and anime series Dragon Ball Z, as well as Dragon Ball GT. She is a Human-Saiyajin quarter breed. In the original Japanese version, she was voiced by Yuko Minaguchi, while she is voiced by Elise Baughman in the FUNimation dub and by Caitlynne Medrek in the Blue Water Studios redubs. It should be noted that Pan's name comes from the Pan of Roman (as well as others) mythology. That means that, at first glance, she appears to have been named after her mother Videl rather than her father Gohan. However, closer inspection reveals a double-pun on behalf of author Akira Toriyama, in that Pan is also the Japanese and Spanish word for bread, continuing her father's food-based name as well as her mother's god-religion-based name.\
 \
 Pan is introduced in the series following the ten year interval between the defeat of Majin Buu and the end of the written Dragon Ball series. In the series, Pan is daughter of the primary character named Son Gohan, and as a result, the granddaughter of the main character named Son Goku. Pan is the only original character in the series with the most diluted Saiyajin heritage, and as a result, it was stated in the Daizenshuu that she didn't have the ability to become a Super Saiyajin. However, this is later contradicted by the Dragon Ball GT Perfect file books that stated that she could have ascended if she trained hard enough. It was also stated by Toriyama that the simple reason to Pan's inability to become a Super Saiyajin was that he could not come up with a logical design for a female Super Saiyajin; being that most of the Super Saiyajin traits are typical of males, and not females.\
 \
 As Pan only appears for three chapters in the manga, her later life is elaborated on in the anime-only series called Dragon Ball GT, where she is seen as a young girl who travels the galaxy with her grandfather Goku, and Trunks, the half-Saiyajin son of the characters Vegeta and Bulma. In the final episode of Dragon Ball GT, Pan is seen as an old woman, being over 100 years old. She is the grandmother to the character named Son Goku Jr., who has the ability to become a Super Saiyajin. This contridicts the Daizenshuu that stated that characters who possessed less then half-Saiyajin heritage did not have the ability to become Super Saiyajins because of diluted blood-lines.\

 <b>Biography</b>\
 Panput is the egotistical champion of two worldwide Martial arts tournaments other than the World Martial Arts Tournament. He plans on making the 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament his third championship victory, before being defeated by Goku in the 4th match of the 1st round. Tien Shinhan dismisses him as \"too cocky.\"\
 \
 Panput breaks a wall\
 His fight against Goku starts with Panput making a flashy entry. However, when he first punches at Goku, he asks if the punch was too fast for him to follow. Goku says \"it wasn't much of a punch,\" so Panput demonstrates his great speed and power by destroying an arena wall with an elbow strike. But, when he attacks Goku again, Goku pulls off a quick three-hit combo to the chest, completely knocking Panput out. The World Tournament Announcer is astonished over the \"single-punch\" KO, and Goku wins the match.\
 \
 During the King Piccolo Saga, Panput is killed by Tambourine with a single kick to the face during a kickboxing match. Panput was fighting another opponent when Tambourine showed up and told Panput that he was there to kill him, before delivering his deadly kick. Panput was later revived by the Dragon Balls, along with the other victims of King Piccolo and his children.\

Later, it is revealed that he is the evil half and evil twin brother of Kami; the two were once a single entity. Piccolo Daimao's name is based on the instrument of the same name — hence, all of his sons share the names of various musical instruments. While he is named after a flute, the others are named after percussion instruments. \
 Piccolo Daimao came into being some 300 years before the beginning of Dragon Ball sometime after a powerful Namekian on Earth attempted to\
 assume the position of guardian of Earth, he was neglected of the position due to the evil that occulted within. As a result, the Namekian\
 concentrated and trained to relinquish the evil within; which conspired into producing two separate entities — if one should perish, the\
 other would also. The concentrated evil being known as Piccolo Daimao. At first, the name \"Piccolo\" was a reference to the wind instrument,\
 but then a revelation by Mr. Popo to Bulma meant it translated to \"different world\" in Namekian.\
 \
 It remained unknown if Piccolo Daimao knew he was a Namekian, as he was shown to know the language and some of his powers and techniques are\
 of Namekian origin, even replicating Guru's throne. If Piccolo Daimao knew, this could mean that the evil within Kami originated from being\

Pu'ar is neither a cat or a mouse, albeit the series creator Akira Toriyama stated that he had drawn the character to look a little bit like a cat. Traveling alongside Yamcha, the two worked as a team robbing anyone traveling through the desert area in which they lived. Pu'ar has an innate ability of levitation or flight, and is nearly always seen simply 'standing' in thin air at about human head height. \
 Pu'ar has the unique ability to shapeshift into any form, even inanimate objects, and can hold that form for as long as desired; though strength is not increased by the change, however, as such is unable to turn into something that can be used up like fuel or food. Pu'ar graduated from the same shapeshifting academy as Oolong, although unlike Oolong, Pu'ar had completed all of the academy training and does not have Oolong's difficulties with maintaining a transformed state. Pu'ar shows up quite a bit in the beginning, but becomes less of a presence as the series continues. As the driving theme of the series is mostly about fighting, Pu'ar can do little more than react to the horrors of the latest supervillains in the story.\
 \
 There is some debate regarding the character's gender. Despite being portrayed by several female voice actors, the character has been referred to with both male and female pronouns during the anime. Though the issue of gender is never directly addressed, Toriyama has referred to Pu'ar as \"he\" while answering a fan question in the \"Ask Me Anything\" section in the back of the manga. Some fans believe that since shape-shifters can assume many different forms, gender is a moot point.\

During his battle with Goku and Piccolo, Gohan seeing his father in danger explodes with rage and delivers a massive amount of damage to Raditz in a single blow. Taking advantage of the situation, Goku puts Raditz in a full nelson and demands Piccolo to kill them both with the Special Beam Cannon. Just before his death, he sneered that two more powerful Saiyans, Vegeta and Nappa, would be coming to Earth in one years time. \

Son Gohan releases him during the Majin Buu Saga when he breaks the Zeta sword, while trying to cut a block made of the strongest material in the universe. After being released, he agreed to help Gohan unlock his full potential so he could defeat Majin Buu, but only in exchange for getting to date an Earth woman. \
 Centuries ago, he used to be quite handsome by his own standards, but a hideous witch came up to him and stole one of his Potara Fusion Earrings and put it on. Rou Kaioushin was instantly combined with the witch permanently. While he lost his looks, he gained more magical power. In the Majin Buu Saga he sacrifices his life so Son Gokuu can live, and gives him the Potara earrings to fuse with Gohan on Earth. However, as he was already residing in heaven, his death had little effect aside from producing a halo over his head.\

 Goten is a fictional character in the manga and anime series Dragon Ball Z, as well as appearing in Dragon Ball GT. He is the second son of Son Goku and Chi Chi. Goten is a Human-Saiyan hybrid, just like his older brother Son Gohan.\
 \
 Son Goten's natural physique almost perfectly replicates his father Goku's, even though his appearance such as hair style and clothes change from time to time. Goten is generally seen wearing an outfit that mimics his father's, with only slight differences. As in the case of the last few episodes of Dragon Ball Z, his hair has grown long, no longer looking like his father's he also wears a blue and white shirt with his name printed on it. In Dragon Ball GT, he wears a white shirt with purple jeans, and his hair is much shorter. His skin color stays lightly tanned for all of his appearances in Dragon Ball Z/GT. Goten, unlike his brother, was never shown to have a tail. This is never explained.\
 \
 In <i>Dragon Ball Online</i> (which takes place 216 years after Dragon Ball Z, and unlike Dragon Ball GT, Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story), it is stated that in 800 Age, Goten, along with Present Day Trunks had created the Kikoukenjutsu Sword School\

He followed his advice for sometime until one night when Goku stepped outside to relieve himself; he then glanced at it, transformed into an Oozaru and killed Gohan by stomping on him.

In every tournament, aside from the 21st, something bad happens that enhances his role such as in the King Piccolo Saga, he witnessed Kuririn murdered by the Demon King Piccolo's warrior Tambourine and later he becomes very important as he witnesses Son Goku's fight with Piccolo from the sidelines with the others, making him one of the few \"civilians\" to know the truth.  \
 At the end of Dragon Ball Z, his age starts to show as he is losing hair and has very noticeable wrinkles, but in Dragon Ball GT his descendant's hair remains white. Although he doubts Mr. Satan for being the one who defeated Cell, he praises him in order to make fans cheer.\

Trunks has a combination of both of his parents' personalities: cocky and proud like his father and spoiled and selfish like his mother.\

 He was once comrades with Kame-Sen'nin and studied under the same Martial Arts school. However, they were defeated by the evil forces of the Piccolo Daimaō and their mentor and sensei Mutaito died after sealing the demon away. Over time, bitterness and resentment began to grow in his heart and he eventually turned away from his master's old teachings and began a school where his hatred of the world began to spread among his pupils.\

 In the 22nd Tenka'ichi Budōkai, he entered his two star pupils, Tenshinhan and Chiaotzu to counter Kame-Sen'nin's pupils, Goku, Kuririn, and Yamcha.\

 After Tenshinhan and Chiaotzu left him, he had his brother Tao Pai Pai rebuilt back to life as a cyborg (Tao was blown up by his own grenade that Goku kicked back at him), and had him enter in the 23rd Tenka'ichi Budōkai to exact revenge on both Tenshinhan and Goku. Tenshinhan, however, easily knocks out Tao with a punch and warns Tsuru-Sen'nin that he never wants to see both of them again.\

 Videl is the daughter of Mr. Satan. Mr. Satan is very protective of her, especially in respect to boys. She grew up learning martial arts hoping to be as great as her dad, when in fact, unknown to herself she was already better than him. She is a tough, tomboyish character, raised with fame all around her. In her spare time, Videl fights crime in Satan City. She becomes suspicious of Gohan after meeting him at Orange Star High School, and she even follows him for a brief time to learn more about him. Videl eventually discovers Gohan's secret identity as the Great Saiyaman. She forces Gohan to teach her how to fly, and makes him enter the 25th Tenka'ichi Budokai under the threat that she'll reveal his identity to the world. After the Buu saga, the two get together, and have a child named Pan.\
