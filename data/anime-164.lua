		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=472,  ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Let me start by saying that I am not a Miyazaki-disciple.  I do not view him as the 'grandmaster of everything anime.' When I say 'yeah...Miyazaki is ok' I say it not out of ignorance (I've almost every one of his films) but because I personally find him to be incredibly overrated.  However I find that when he has all of his stuff together, Miyazaki can destroy practically any other director out there, the man is incredibly talented, but his problem is consistency.  \nWhen I say that Princess Mononoke is his masterpiece, I mean it.  It was the first film where\n          \n        he finally got everything together and made a perfect anime film.  Some will say that Spirited Away is better, but Mononoke is so much more powerful than that.\nStory: Miyazaki does not like civilization.  He stated once that he would prefer it if we went back to living in the fields, he wants to get rid of all technology.  In Mononoke we see the evils of industralization and how humans are killing the earth.  Humans can coexist.  But many purposefully try to make themselves better and stronger.  Miyazaki does an absolutely amazing job of showing that industralization, if handled the wrong way, is an incredible evil, but that it is in the hands of humans..of real people.  I didn't really care all too much for the story, but I found his use of spirits to be incredible.  I wasn't a huge fan of the story itself, it was a country boy goes to the city vibe...but I was a huge fan of all the political jabbings that Miyazaki was throwing. I will admit that I didn't notice it the first time around, I was told this as I watched it the second or third time, by my friend who is a Miyazaki acolyte.  The beauty of the story really comes after you watch it the second or third time, as the whole movie experience is very overwhelming.\nArt:  I give it a 7.  I am not a fan at all of Ghibli.  I absolutely cannot stand their use of recycling their characters. I hate how all the women look exactly the same, and the men have the same annoying mustaches and beard combos that obscure almost their entire face.  I find it lazy and incredibly detracting.  I found that Ashitaka was.....boring, his design was so lacklustre that I have now just googled him to figure out exactly what he looked like.  Where the art shines in this is in the spirits (gods), the creatures, and San.  The designs of those characters alone redeemed the art for me.  Also worth noting that in the beginning all those 'snakes' were done digitally, which was, for me, impressive.  \nSound: Eh....what can I say.  Miyazaki films ALWAYS have great music and soundtracks.  I have never found an instance in watching any of his films where I've gone 'hey, the music doesn't really feel right.'  The music in his films are absolutely superb.\nCharacter:  I felt that the characters weren't really people so much as symbols.  I felt that Ashitaka, in a certain way, was innocence.  When his arm is cursed he is given a power that he cannot wield and he struggles to find a way to cure it, to get rid of the curse that now stains his arm and will kill him.  Eboshi was industralization, but she was also compassion.  I felt that she was the most human of all the characters, even though many people view her as an antagonist or slap her with the label of 'oh..she's the evil lady.'  The thing I appreciate about this film is that there are only a handful of truly bad people.  Everyone else is human.  San is humans living with nature, but at the same time she is a beast herself.  She lives in harmony with nature and has absolutely no qualms about killing to defend her land.  Every character is multifaced, however if you only view the movie once you might not see the different characteristics of each character.\nEnjoyment:  The perfect Miyazaki film.  It is deep for people who are looking at it closely, but it is also just a fun film for people who are only looking for something fun to watch.  The first time I watched this (the first Miyazaki film I'd ever seen) I wasn't impressed at all.  Mind you, I was probably 10 at the time, this was the first exposure to REAL anime I'd ever had.  But as I watched it again recently I realized just how great of a film it really is.\nHowever it really is accessible.  You talk to almost anyone about anime and they'll probably (99% likely) know about Princess Mononoke.  I know that this turns a lot of people off.  Personally when someone comes up to me and says 'hey, I saw Samurai Champloo and it was great, can you recommend me anything else kind of like it?' It makes my skin crawl a little bit.  However, Mononoke is a staple, and is really something that you should watch, if you haven't watched it, I would definitely put it at the top of your to-watch list.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=232,  ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    First of all I'd like to say this is my favorite Miyazaki Film. Why you might ask? Its the most powerful and thought provoking of all his films. It also communicates a message very differently since it has much darker overtones than his other lighthearted films. While they may be enjoyable and powerful in their own way they can never be compared to the stature of this film. I hold this one higher than the quality of Spirited Away. Which in my opinion is then most overrated Miyazaki/anime film. This is the one film that Miyazaki completed perfectly because it gave you that feeling that\n          \n        it couldn't get any better. The film has themes that even an adult could enjoy immensely. \nThe story is basically can be summed up as Man's conflict against the natural world. While this may be a good summarization it also could be misleading because with Mononoke we don't get a classic good vs evil plot. The fascination I have with this film stems from the many groups that are at conflict with one another and how no one is truly the evildoer. We have nature battling with human civilization while within itself there are humans trying to topple each other. The story revolves around how self-destructive we are as human beings and how we haven't realized we are innate in nature. The movie gives us parallels of the battles that the humans face with each other while still all congregating together for that one perceived enemy in the film, nature. All in all the film tries to communicate a deep message through the story and it leaves the viewer with a lasting impression.\nThe characters in this film are fascinating. Particularly Ashitaka and Princess Mononoke. We follow the story through Ashitaka's experiences with the different warring groups in the story. He always is the rational character in the movie and he openly tries to correct the irrationalities the other characters have. he serves as the medium which communicates the overall story and how meaningless the conflict can be found to be. He is extremely brave and he usually gets himself in dangerous situations in order to show the others their incorrect ways. Princess Mononoke is another intricately created character which is full of mystery. She seems to detest fellow humans for their selfish egotism and hostility towards earth and its inhabitants. Lady Eboshi is the a character some may mistakenly confuse for the villain of the movie. I think this would be more prevalent with western viewers like myself. The reason for this is they might seem to mistake her as another modern day oil baron except she is much more than that. Her main goal is to protect her people, particularly the other women who live in the city. She feels in order to do this She has to pursue the industrialization of her city in order to protect her people from the samurais and beasts of nature.\nIn the animation department this is a Studio Ghibli film so you obviously will get an amazing experience visually at least. With this film though I feel the animation captures the essence of nature. It does this with the various beasts and mystical characters Miyazaki created. There are even gods in this movie which helps bring about the feeling that nature is alive. You will enjoy the action sequences in this movie. Especially the battles between Lady Eboshi and Princess Mononoke. I also think the use of CGI in this film was done well and this is coming from someone who despises CGI. \nThe music in this movie is beautiful. Its the kind that can put you in a trance that you wouldn't want to ever wake up from. Especially the main theme song. A lot of the music puts you in the right mood for the film. Especially the more darker music which is used during scenes with the beasts of nature. The battle scenes also have plesant sounds and the sword fights don't contain the same sword clashing sound *cough Nausicaa cough*.\nAnyways, I recommend this film because its Miyazaki's Masterpiece.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=166,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    For each new Studio Ghibli film I watch, I just get more and more convinced that they are the best animation movie studio out there. Princess Mononoke is by no means an exception.\nAshitaka, the last prince of a people called the Enishi, gets cursed while fighting a demon, and sets out on a journey to get rid of the curse, which can be lethal. He soon hears rumors of a forest spirit that can give and take away life, and sets out to find it. However, he soon finds himself in the middle of a fight between humans and animals, and he soon gets to\n          \n        know of a girl called Princess Mononoke, who has sided with the animals.\nThe way the story is presented makes it really enjoyable, as we get to see how various humans and animals view the ongoing fight. Different humans have different viewpoints, different animals have different viewpoints, and it makes it so that part of what they think is right, but they're also wrong about things. In the middle we have Ashitaka, who is the only one looking for a peaceful resolution to this struggle. It's mainly the theme of destroying nature that's mainly being touched upon, a theme I feel is something everyone should think about. \nThe small love story you that's presented is what some would call forced. At least I do. I didn't quite like the way in which it was presented, but different persons have different opinions. It was okay enough though, but nothing that really placed itself in my heart. Maybe they just didn't do enough with it. But it's okay, since the focus of this movie is other things than love.\nAs expected of Studio Ghibli, the visuals are stunning, especially when you think about the movie's age (8 years). With its massive budget of 2,4 billion yen, what else is there to expect anyway? The environments are drawn extremely beautifully, be it mountains, lakes, villages, trees or underbrush. Sometimes I just forgot the movie because of the stunning environments. Thank heavens for rewinding! The character motions are extremely fluid and lifelike, and with a total of 144 000 cels during the movie, you couldn't expect anything less (I even heard that Miyazaki re-drew quite a lot of them himself). I got quite surprised when I learned that they used CGI in the movie; I couldn't spot it at all. That again serves to prove the quality of it. The character designs are typical Studio Ghibli-ish, so you'll know what to expect in that department if you've watched a Studio Ghibli film.\nThe music is perfectly in tune with the movie, giving that calm, mysterious kind of feeling that you'll expect when in a forest where magical creatures are as normal as insects. But ti doesn't do anything more than that, really.\nOverall, Princess Mononoke is a film that you might enjoy the most for its stunning natural environments; they almost overshadow the plot. But all the different factions, the different viewpoints in the fight, and last but definitely not least, the theme of destroying nature are all something that everyone should give a thought. Especially the latter.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=93,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Warning: This review may contain significant plot spoilers and is really more intended for the thought and entertainment of those who have already watched the movie.	\nFor a while now I've been hearing rave reviews about Hayao Miyazaki's films. He certainly has an impressive track record, having created the three most popular animated movies in Japan. Apparently his anime work is greeted with positive reception everywhere, for this movie was placed in Roger Ebert's own top ten favorite movies for 1999. It's about time I finally watched it for myself, but it's left me with a strange aftertaste, and I'll tell you why.\n	The movie opens with\n          \n        a dramatic scene that shows off the superior animation quality in the form of a worm-covered boar demon. The main character and hero of the movie, Ashitaka, is introduced. He makes short work of the beast as it advances on his home village, but not without being cursed himself. Afterwards the village leader explains to him that he must leave forever because the curse is going to agonizingly rip through his soul, eliminating every remnant of his being before killing him shortly after. In her own words he is now completely dead to all of them, and may god be with him as he leaves to the West on some hopeless quest for self justification. Ashitaka replies simply, showing no fear at all, leaving in what appears to be some kind of manly, stoic demeanor. He wouldn't have even said goodbye to his family if it weren't for his younger sister seeking him out as he rides away into the night.\n	Frankly, Ashitaka is one of the most brick-like characters I have ever watched. It takes well over half the movie for him to display any kind of feelings at all. Quiet, brooding, and mysterious characters are always great side additions to someone a little more exciting, but Ashitaka isn't there to complement anyone. He is the main character, and his empty lack of reflection on everything that happens in the story ended up encouraging my own empty lack of reflection. However, the problems don't end there. The other half of his personality is being Mr. Perfect. Mr. Perfect never explains what he's doing or why he's doing it, but he always resolves every situation without any sort of doubt or difficulty. He is the walking antithesis of conflict. In fact all his presence ever really does is delay some sort of inevitable action. This character doesn't feel like he should be the focus of anything. He's flawless and emotionless and what's left is this feeling that the story might have been better off without him. The main events of the movie are set in motion and concluded without his significant involvement. The only thing that's changed by his presence is that two characters who are destined to kill each other are  forced to wait a little longer.\n	This movie could have been a lot more enjoyable if the focus was on someone else. It's like every character besides Ashitaka is interesting and has some kind of inner conflict or apparent goal. Granted, all of the characters are as flat as a slab of concrete, but at least some of them could drive the story somewhere. Perhaps the story could have followed San, the savage human girl raised by monstrous, intelligent wolves. Or maybe it could have focused on Lady Eboshi, a woman hell bent on destroying an entire magical forest to advance her manufacturing of advanced guns designed by lepers, all so she can conquer Japan and, presumably, the rest of the world. Even Jigo could make a more interesting story as an undercover agent posing as a monk who, ironically, is tasked with killing gods.\n	Unfortunately, despite these exciting events, this leads into my other complaint: This story is random and full of holes. I'm picky about plot. When someone tells me that a movie is great I expect some kind of reasoning for the events that take place within. As the movie progressed I found everything increasingly less believable. No, I don't mean believable as in magic and gods; I mean believable as in characters and actions are motivated by some kind of evidence. Early in the movie Mr. Perfect pays for a bag of rice with a gold nugget, impressing everyone in the town he's passing through. Why would someone from a tiny village that was exiled from the Japanese empire be sporting gold, and why wasn't it ever mentioned later on? Is it just a stab to emphasize Ashitaka's flawlessness? The lying monk whose job is to kill the forest spirit, a powerful and benevolent god, was asked to do so by the emperor. Why? To kill the forest? Why does everyone want to destroy the forest to begin with? For natural resources? While that does make a little bit of sense, it's never clearly confirmed or denied. Instead you're left with this epic battle between Iron Town and nature in which everything is destroyed.\n	The entire movie is comprised of seemingly random events that were all designed for the purpose of making it to the end and looking really dramatic along the way. I mean really, LEPERS are designing Lady Eboshi's guns? One second Ashitaka displays freakish demonic strength and the next he's out cold for days. The very climax of the movie came from absolutely nowhere! Upon being beheaded, the benevolent holy forest spirit god whatever who disapproves of war turns into a giant raging blob of doom that indiscriminately kills everything in it's path. Mr. Perfect returns its head so it can become normal again, but it would have happened about thirty seconds later without his help anyways. Iron Town and the forest are both leveled, but that's O.K. because the revival of the forest spirit plants new seedlings so it can all grow again. San leaves Ashitaka because she can &ldquo;never forgive the humans for what they have done,&rdquo; and Lady Eboshi vows to rebuild Iron Town &ldquo;even better than before.&rdquo;\nBasically what I'm trying to say is that after everything that happens its all back to square one. Perhaps in the future Ashitaka convinces everyone to live in harmonious peace, but it doesn't matter because it didn't happen in this movie. I was left with a feeling that the story's net change was zero, and I hate watching anime that ends this way. Sure, people died and stuff got trashed, but there is no PLOT ADVANCEMENT! Every time I see a story that ends this way (like Trigun, for example) it makes me want to smash my head into my computer monitor until I faint. But I guess the visuals were great, and the music too: top notch for this medium! Great really, it's so great! If you like Naruto or Inuyasha or Death Note or whatever then this movie is probably some kind of godsend. Really, I think you should watch it and then you should watch everything else created by Miyazaki and demand more and more and more and more and more and more! There's nothing like endless waves of mediocrity constantly pumping out of the studios to keep us all entertained. Who cares about little details when we can just keep getting more of it?!?! We say screw quality because that takes TOO LONG. Quick somebody get me more anime that I can inject into my veins and get high on big shiny eyes, impossibly attractive characters, and cool demons and shit FUCK YEAH!\n\n-You can read all my non anime related reviews at my blog: alexanderzero.wordpress.com\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=23,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    “What exactly are you here for? – To see with eyes unclouded by hate.”\nEffectively conveying a message through any sort of fictional medium can be quite a handful, however a handful of directors/screenwriters/authors etc. managed to carve their names in stone, understanding and mastering the art of storytelling in the medium they so choose to work with.  Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, Stephen Spielberg and J.R.R. Tolkien are some names you’ll become tired of hearing after a bit of time, but the fact that their names alone are so prevalently mentioned when talking about “all time classics” speaks for one important aspect: They understood human\n          \n        nature and their conflicts, they created something outstandingly unique, that even within an ever-changing society and environment, these titles managed to hold out strong over many years and probably will for many years to come. \nWhen talking about the Anime and Manga medium, there are lots of outstanding directors mostly unknown in the west, but still manage to claim a place in the everlasting hall of legends: Osamu Tezuka as the “creator of all”, Hideaki Anno with the controversial Neon Genesis Evangelion, Mamoru Oshii with works as Ghost in the Shell, Shinichiro Watanabe with Cowboy Bebop, Satoshi Kon with Millennium Actress/Perfect Blue and Masaaki Yuasa with his most recent works, which inevitably claim cult status after more time passes. The creator of Mononoke Hime and the person most frequently associated with Studio Ghibli, Hayao Miyazaki, gains respect not only in Japan, but his works are also well-known all around the world, practically making him the “godfather” of Anime as seen by a broad spectrum of people. Even though his general reputation seems to fade away slowly, partly because the losing presence of Ghibli in general and partly because of Animemestars circle-jerking a troll and misattributed quote to Miyazaki, Mononoke Hime definitely stands the test of time, providing extra material and to understand him as a person, his philosophy and beliefs in general. Mononoke Hime is both a blockbuster (family) movie and a profound work of art at the same time, built-upon the foundations of Ghibli’s style itself and advancing its qualities even further. \nMajor Spoilers ahead.\nRight from the get go we get introduced to a much darker premise than we have been accustomed by Studio Ghibli. Prince Ashitaka gets bitten by a boar possessed by a demon, carving his teeth into his right arm, corrupting it. The hatred that spawned within the boar now got transmitted onto Ashitaka, granting him superhuman strength in his limb on one hand but works as a deadly poison infesting him to the marrow of his bones, causing death eventually. Guided by the elder of his village in the East, he receives prophecy to go to the estates of the east, the lands where the infested boar seemingly came from, and act as an impartial observer and possible peacemaker with “eyes unclouded by hate”, a statement that holds incredible substance in its entire runtime. Ashitaka takes on what seems like his final act and allows us, the viewers, to dive into the lands of West, with all their beauty and their dangers alongside with him. \nAshitaka advances deeper into foreign territory, seeing both the ravages of war and active battles to be fought. With Mononoke Hime we get to see probably the most violent entry from Ghibli until now, with beheaded soldiers from Ashitaka’s arrows, cut-off limbs and imagery of active fighting, which were toned down by the refraining usage of blood and the not simplistic, but still cartoon-ish depiction of human stature. \nThe general artistry of Mononoke Hime is absolutely stunning, ranging from beautiful and mystic shots of landscapes and their inhabitants of both spiritual and carnal nature, to the writhing and corrupted skin of the boar initially attacking Ashitaka, the lurking and chilling shadows of apes in the background to the perfected gracefulness of the while wolves, not stylized to be harmful, but to show that their fangs still pack the punch to kill if necessary. The Animation is as fluent as the pond within the forest itself, ranging from top-tier Animation during fighting sequences, cramped markets in towns, to lively depictions of the forest life with insane attention to detail in both artwork and sense of movement, virtually making you feel the same exact breeze the characters are surrounded by. \nWith Ashitaka’s notice of a deranged balance the farther he dives into the lands of the West, we finally get introduced it to the main actors of this conflict. On the “human” side of things, we have Lady Eboshi with her troops and bunch of very tough ladies, defending their homemade fortress and iron ore mine against the animals from the forest, while also destroying it little by little. On the opposite side of things we find the San, her two siblings and her mother, who all happen to be wolves, the first one mentally, the other three physically. Those are of course not the only beings inhabiting these threatened lands, as other species such as the tribe of apes and the later-introduced tribe of boars, with them and their leader having travelled from far distant lands, joining forces in this conflict and become thus important as well. \nWhat could’ve been watered down to another classic “Men vs. Nature” type of story, where the good and the evil side has been decided from minute one onwards, Miyazaki’s implementation of grey morality, while still incorporating environmental themes to their fullest is definitely a work to be admired. The way how the wolves attack Lady Eboshi’s troops almost viciously the moment they’re introduced is simultaneously the first attempt, in blurring the lines between good and evil, much in contrast to the clear mentioning of how the wound induced by a man-made “bolt of iron” was the cause for the corruption of the boar right at the start. This attempt of straining the idea of good and evil gets even more support, by San’s and the Wolves’ apathetic and adverse behaviour upon first sight, as Ashitaka carries two wounded soldiers from their attack. As one of them suffered serious injuries and the ordinary way up the hill would cost too much time for his critical condition, Ashitaka decides to take the path straight through the cursed woods, as the citizens of Eboshi’s city call it, but much to their surprise there are no dangers to be found, instead the spirits which reside in the forest happen to guide Ashitaka the way. Those spirits, yet to be touched by the on-going war, function as beings whose eyes have not been clouded by the spreading hate between animals and humans yet and accept Ashitaka and the wounded men as who they are: living beings solely passing the forest.\nAshitaka arrives at Lady Eboshi’s city and receives an appreciative welcome by Eboshi, the men and women of the village themselves. He gets introduced to a functioning society, where the citizens work hard and discrimination seems to have grown obsolete, due to the strong hand of Eboshi and the mutual respect and belief for each other. It almost resembles a kind of utopia, especially considering the time-period we’re in and the regressive impression we’ve gotten from the lands under Samurai leadership and their ravaged areas. Eboshi herself freed women from brothels, gave immedicable invalids the chance to actively contribute in society and made incredible progress to strengthen and defend her idea against foes from of both, human and animalistic nature. On the other hand the resemblance of industrial revolution and craftsmanship are taking the materials they need by force, developing even more effective weapons to both expand by force and defend with resolve, much to the disliking of the residents of the forest. While this might seem like a harmless act of expansion, Lady Eboshi’s goal behind all of this is to slowly take down the god of the forest, not by an active act of killing, but more of a mere try to eject him over time. Her mind-set drastically changes after political influence reigns down on her later in the movie though, making an active act of killing preferable.\nOn the other side of things, the motivations of the San, her “mother” and her siblings are far from gratuitous as well, wanting to bring down Lady Eboshi for her steady expand in their territory and the rising imminence for the different inhabitants and the god of the forest himself. It’s a conflict of ideals about the urgent question of coexistence, a question often raised in the history of mankind, where an inherently true is impossible to find, since an individual’s philosophy and ideas are overly prominent while crafting one’s opinion about that matter and Miyazaki is here to give us his. \nAshitaka learns that his efforts of procuring peace between both abhorrent parties remain futile, since both Lady Eboshi and her loyal following and San and the wolves have fully grown seeds of hatred planted in both of them, seeming like they are both floating in an individual bubble, both unable and unwilling to understand the other party. These “bubbles of philosophy” resemble industrialism on one hand and environmentalism on the other, both having lost the common sense of negotiation and willing to take their philosophy to their graves. The state of unwillingness to give in becomes even more apparent during Ashitaka’s talk with San’s wolfmother, as she was already foreseeing the upcoming end of the forest and hers (“I’m lying here and listen to the deceasing forest and like the forest, I’m gonna die soon as well”), but even then she mentions that her last goal and omnipresent dream still is to “bash this baneful woman inside her fangs”, leaving her gained wisdom over the ages for the sole purpose of executing redemption. Miyazaki’s ability to blur the lines of good and evil so effortlessly and ultimately not criticizing each side for their philosophy being wrong in its entirety, much more the unwillingness to adapt and cut short, especially on the side of industrialism. He doesn’t portray or believe that the idea of industrialism and technological advancement is inherently bad in its core, as a lot of people tend to see this movie; it more than anything criticizes the lack of understanding for nature itself in contrast to the sole faith in man-made technology. Lady Eboshi and her followers, spoiled by the desirable advancements and wealth caused by the those technical advancements, have to learn what the highly growing ignorance towards nature itself eventually causes, when the seemingly killed forest god, who is able to decide between upon life and death itself, goes rampage in his spirit form in a desperate attempt to get his carnal head back.\n“You cannot alter your fate. However, you can rise to meet it.” – Elder, talking to Ashitaka.\nWhile Mononoke Hime’s strength lies in its densely packed narrative with its superb exploration of environmental themes, the characterization takes the backseat to it, not claiming that it is generally lacking in any way. Ashitaka’s borderline naïve but still unbreakable resolve, partly induced by the elder’s encouraging parting words, willing to negotiate with both parties of the conflict and the sensation he finds with San upon first sight are very engrossing in their own right, serving as the perfect “medium” for the viewer to dive into the conflict in the Western lands unbiased. With San I would’ve wished for a little more insight in her backstory, other than her disdain for humans I might’ve wanted to see or hear more about the progress and the steady loss of identification of hers as a human, be it in form of a flashback or San actively telling Ashitaka. Lady Eboshi and the wolfmother serve as the key-figures on how Miyazaki wants to implement the clash of the philosophies, but also manages to not view them as such during its runtime, an achievement most writers fail to implement not nearly as good. Of course complaints about lacking character-development for these two characters are rendered obsolete, since it would strictly go against Miyazaki’s message to develop them before the eventual climax. Other characters don’t get explored nearly as much as the ones already mentioned and are not nearly as memorable, but serve their purpose as e.g. Jigo threads the plot of killing the forest god actively on orders from the emperor of Japan.\nAs I’ve already talked about how the atmosphere and artistry created by the gorgeous and lively visuals alone are one of Mononoke Hime’s greatest strength, I’ve yet to touch upon the quality of the soundtrack and let me get this straight: the score of Joe Hisahi is nothing short of being the work of a genius, having managed to place itself into my top 10 favourite OSTs of all time. Being my favourite soundtrack of Hisahi as stand-alone as well as being incredibly fitting to a story like Princess Mononoke itself, the orchestral sounds ranging from soothing to utterly intense do add to the impeccable sense of scale the movie manages to build up right from the start. Probably the most memorable moment of the whole film for me has to be Ashitaka’s dialogue with the wolfmother right in front of the beautiful scenery of the forest at nighttime and the vocals of Mononoke’s main theme kicking in, once again showing how well Ghibli can bring certain moments to life by perfect interaction of dialogue, scenery and music. \nConclusion:\nMononoke Hime sucks you in from minute one and manages to execute virtually everything it is trying to with utmost competency. Starting with the clear lack of manipulation to a specific side, we get a deep view into polar opposites in philosophy, exposing flaws in narrow-minded and ignorant thinking on both sides, but with a clear message being conveyed by the credits are rolling in. Miyazaki has allowed us to dive deeper into his way of thinking, but never was telling us to feel the same way, much rather showing us two philosophies clashing together with direful ignorance towards one another and with eyes clouded by hate, making understanding impossible until it’s too late. While I might’ve had some minor problems with San’s character, would’ve wished for more exposition regarding Jigo and the emperor of Japan and the ending coming a little too fast for its own good, they really don’t matter much in the grand scheme of things. Miyazaki only topped this one with his first and simultaneously last big Manga project he ever worked on, named “Kaze no Tani no Nausicaä”, covering and advancing the story of the correspondent movie.\nStory (9.5/10)\nArt (10/10), Animation (10/10)\nSound (10/10)\nCharacters (8/10)\nEnjoyment (9/10)\nOverall (9/10)"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=47,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    First off, I LOVE Hayao Miyazaki and a lot of his movies. I fell in love with Studio Ghibli’s artwork, music, and pretty much anything about them. This is one of my all time favorite movies in fact. Just the story line is so beautiful about how man and nature are supposed to live side by side but when one fights against the other, there can be both misunderstandings and consequences. The story is open to interpretation but it feels like a timeless tale. A lot of times, I found myself believing that he could have made the story in this time frame and it\n          \n        would have had the same meaning behind the story. I’m going to sort of talk about what I consider part of this Psychology of this show, and this is only what I feel is part of this. What you take from it may be different.\nThe story is set in the Muromachi period of Japan when there were few Emishi people. The Emishi were actually a real people in Japan much like the Native Americans were to America. They lived in harmony with the land and had different tribes slightly different cultures and so on. Not much is actually known of the Emishi like where they came from and from what I have read, there are very few groups left. \nThe story of this movie follows the ‘last prince’ Ashitaka. I looked around but I couldn't find much on if this was a real person or not. I don’t believe he is a real character and was more symbolic of how that tribe was dieing out. Anyway, in order to protect his village, he kills a demon that was rampaging nearby and is cursed by the demon as he died. It turns out the demon was actually a boar god who was driven crazy by an iron ball that was shot into his body. In order to save himself and protect his village further, he leaves his people and travels west never to return to his people. I see this sort of a symbolic image, the idea of the young leaving their native land, the land they were born into and the culture they were born into, and being integrated into the Japanese basic ideas. It’s similar to the way Native Americans turned away from their culture to become part of the ‘white man’s world’ here in America. Not being able to return pretty much is the same where once you learn something different, you’re never really the same person as you once were.\nAs Ashitaka leaves, he sees the world outside his home as different and we get to see it through his eyes as bandits sort of rampage through another village he runs into. The places we see and the world we see outside his village just ends up looking like a rather cruel and selfish place. I think that was done on purpose as it again shows everything through the eyes of a boy who grew up in a place where everyone took care of everyone else. He goes farther from his village and the areas seem to get harsher until he finds Irontown which in many ways could be like Tokyo or New York in our age. It is a place with ‘futuristic machines’, guns, iron working and so on. Actually, I think the better thought of this place would probably be Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Pittsburgh was pretty much known for their Steel work. \nAnd here in lies a problem. In order to get iron sand for making their weapons and machines, they must clear down the forest near them. Unfortunately, the forest spirits don't like this, which leads to the war between nature and humans. I consider San as like the ‘hippie’ or hard core nature lovers who think they are fighting for natures rights. Without giving away the ending, the whole feel of this movie seems to be about trying to find a balance between humans destructive nature and of nature itself. And that’s what I love about this movie. It’s something that a lot of people are trying to do now as well with all the new eco friendly things we have been doing lately to protect the earth.\nThe artwork is astounding and that’s saying a lot since it was all cel done. Each background, character, and lighting had to be hand drawn over and over again. In fact, according to the wiki, there were over 144,000 cels and Miyazaki personally oversaw each and every one of them, including redrawing parts of 80,000 of them. That is dedication to his work guys and that is why I love his work so much. They even give them a lot of detail down to small crust near the boar’s eyes and the almost realistic backgrounds that seemed to capture your eyes with every detail. There was very little computer animation used in the show, parts like the demon flesh on Ashitaka but I never noticed. They perfectly made it seamless. In fact, I had no clue it was computer animated in those parts until I did a little research for this review and that is what surprised me more. \nI only watched this show in English, and I was not sorry. I fell in love with the voices; each person did a wonderful job trying to give the characters a realistic way of talking that worked well with that character. I do have some little nit picks though that I have to do. I might have praised this show up and down but I can also see some of the ‘mistakes’ that were done in it. Billy Crudup was the voice of Ashitaka and he played the character a bit too bland I think. I understand the character is not a wild and brave guy, he is just an average guy who left his family but he just sounds a bit to shy at times. Also, even though Billy Bob Thornton was the rather good voice of an old monk named Jiko-bo, he just never really grabbed me as much as I think that character should of. I don’t know exactly if this was intended but Jiko-bo just felt like he didn't know what he wanted to be. I could never tell if he was a good guy, a bad guy, or even what he was. You would think him being a monk would mean he would be one with the spiritual side of things but then on the other hand, he seems to be against them as well. He was a very confusing character for me and though Billy did a good job conveying that confusion in what he was, I wish he would of leaned a little more to one side instead of being so in the middle.\nI fell in love with this movie so much, and it is definitely a must see for anyone who loves Studio Ghibli or movies with deep meaning behind them. That’s why this gets a very high rating from me.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=30,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Ah, Princess Mononoke. It was one of the most earlier films, and anime in general, that I watched, and was captivated at first sight. \nThe thing I love about this movie is that I've seen so many different takes on what people viewed as the purpose behind the plot. I've read in a few different places that Miyazaki is not a fan of industrialization (or what it has evolved into) and clearly that is represented in the overarching plot in this movie. Whether or not that was the true meaning Miyazaki was trying to portray, he nevertheless sends a powerful message of the side effects\n          \n        of industrialization and not respecting the natural Earth and its resources. I've also read opinions where people were a little disappointed in the movie's plot because 'its one big ad for environmentalism.' I obviously view that as an extremist point of view and while I can see where people who say that are coming from, I feel they did not watch the movie with an open mind or already had some preconceptions about the movie. And of course, first impressions are everything, so once you come away with that mentality, its hard to adjust. Yes, the whole environmentalism aspect does play a part, but its so much more than that. It's about the struggle of man to find a niche in the world all the while trying to find a right balance in respecting it. \nMiyazaki also decides to throw in a little romance as a secondary plot and I thought it worked well. It was not the main focus of the story and there really wasn't a point in the movie where they forced it down your throat. It was there, for the people who wanted to see something develop between Ashitaka and San, but for the people who could care less about it, it easily could have been pushed aside for the main view the movie was portraying. \nI loved how in this movie, we never had any good or evil. Just two completely different points of view of what the sides viewed as 'right' or 'correct.' Miyazaki included the right cast of characters to represent each side of the struggle. First you have the animal gods, who obviously are the victims of human industrialism and simply want to live in their forest of peace. He also included San, our Wolf Princess, to give us a human's point of view from that side too. On the other spectrum, we have Eboshi, who cared for her tribes people, evident in the way she took care of the wounded and only wanted to best for her people. And finally Ashitaka. A lot of people have mixed feelings of him because he never really seemed interesting and just 'was there.' In my eyes, that's exactly what his character was meant to be. He was an outsider to this war between human and nature. Coming from a small village where villagers already respected the Earth, he was more of a witness to all of the events, and simply wanted to find a way where both parties could be appeased and eventually, everyone live in harmony. I thought in that aspect, he played his role exceptionally well.\nIt's a Miyazaki film, and sound is usually top-notch, and that's definitely the case with Mononoke. The music was peaceful when in the countryside, fierce when in battle and soothing during the more emotional moments of the film. The main theme song is still one of my all-time favorites to this day. \nI've watched this film only in the original Japanese cast, so I can't comment on the English VAs, but I felt the Japanese VAs did a pretty good job with their respective roles. The animal gods voices were rough, yet understandable and unique to each species. They fit rather well. Though in some of the more 'inspired' moments of the movie, I remember being quite disappointed with a view of the voiced lines. But nothing too big. \nBackground art was beautiful. I have a friend who is an art major and he once commented to me on how amazing some of the scenery is done in Princess Mononoke. I guess I kind of took that comment to heart as I also believe that 100%. Animation holds up to today's standards, and in some instances, I feel it even outshines some of the stuff production companies do today. I feel Princess Mononoke is Studio Ghibli at its finest. Everything feels fluid, body movements move realistically and believably for the world that the movie is casted in. \nI guess because this is one of my earlier experiences with anime, this movie holds a special place in my heart and no matter what other people may say about this, nothing can convince me otherwise. I will admit that there are some scenes in the movie which drag on a little too much for one's liking and I felt they could have handled the Deer god's head thing a little better than what was seen in the final outcome. However, those are just small pet peeves I had about a movie in which I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. \nThe best part about this movie, in my opinion, is that it has something for everyone. Whether you're looking for something thought provoking, or simply something to watch without having to think too much into the situation, Princess Mononoke can be seen in both lights. Action events are done exquisitely as is the touching romance between San and Ashitaka. \n        "},

Another classic from Hayao Miyazaki.\nBefore watching this, the only other Miyazaki film I had seen was Spirited Away. That was my favorite anime at the time. After watching Mononoke, I found a new favorite.\nI think the english dub of the film is one of the better ones out there. Their choices for voice actors and actresses were good for the film.\nThe animation was superb, as was the music. The strength of Mononoke lies in the story. I really felt connected to the characters. When Ashitaka was searching for San, I felt the sense of urgency with which he was running. I was practically\n          \n        jumping up and down while rooting for him to reach her.\nThe ending was definitely different from Miyazaki's other films, but then again, I feel that you have to look at this film differently. It was something you would not expect and I feel it is a good thing.\nPrincess Mononoke is definitely one of my top anime of all time, and my favorite anime film. If only they can give it a Disney release like they did Miyazaki's other film.\n        "},

Review #24: Princess Mononoke\nThroughout the months and days that I have been reviewing animes, I have been reviewing anime shows and OVA's, and I just previously reviewed one movie which would be Resident Evil: Degeneration. I will say that I was not originally planning on reviewing this movie this time around. I was actually hoping to do a series of reviews of Studio Ghibli films someday. This review was actually requested by a good friend of mine and today just so happens to be her birthday. She did not request the\n          \n        Resident Evil: Degeneration review, I threw that review in as a little \"Tribute\" review since she just started getting into the Resident Evil series and encouraging me to cosplay as Albert Wesker at Aki-con which is an anime convention in Bellevue, Washington which isn't too far from where I live. She did not suggest the Wesker cosplay, it was one of my other friends. My trip in that convention was 20% badass. Yeah, I just used the 20% Cooler meme from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic except I twisted it around, and yes...I'm a Brony, deal with it. Just so you know, I am not one of those super-obsessed fans of the show but I actually enjoy the show because of its humor. I consider myself a \"Brony\" because I will admit that I am a fan of the show, I'm what you could call a \"Normal Brony\".  I think enough has been said for this intro of mine, my friend wanted me to review this movie on her birthday and I shall begin the review of Hayao Miyazaki's epic masterpiece...Princess Mononoke!\n\n\nSomewhere in Japan, a rampaging boar-god is heading towards a villiage and the confident young warrior and prince Ashitaka defends and protects his village. In the process, he is hit with a deadly curse and is told to leave his village. To save his life, he has to journey to the forests in the west. Once he arrives there, he gets involved in a fierce conflict that humans are waging on the forest. The ambitious Lady Eboshi and her loyal group use their guns against the gods of the forest and a brave young woman, Princess Mononoke who was raised by a wolf-god. Ashitaka sees the good in both sides and attempts to stem the flood of blood. This ends up with both sides showing animosity towards Ashitaka as he supports both sides. An epic battle that the humans will never forget ensues and the fate of the world rests on the courage of one warrior.\n\n\n\nTo be technical, this is a Studio Ghibli production and stating the obvious could not be avoided here. This film shares quite a history that I will love to dive deep into. Princess Mononoke is a film that was 4 years in the making, it was also the most expensive Japanese animated film at the time which was more expensive than the 1988 landmark anime film Akira. This was also the final Studio Ghibli film to have hand-painted animation cels. It was also the highest grossing film in Japan before being surpassed by Titanic. It also won Best Picture in Japan while being the first animated film to ever win Best Picture in Japan. Princess Mononoke was declared by Miyazaki-san that it would be his final film before he went into retireme...Oh wait, he never retired yet. I guess Miyazaki-san changed his mind at the time. Princess Mononoke has been highly regarded as Miyazaki-san's masterpiece and magnum opus and I can obviously see why. This is the pinnacle of Miyazaki-san's career and by far the most environmental film that he has ever made. His other films have some environmental themes thrown in but not as heavy as Princess Mononoke. This is the film that we can assume that he always wanted to create and the film that is closer to his heart. This is the only Miyazaki movie that is not really meant for a younger audience. Sure, there's violence in the movie as well as some blood and gore. Not only that, there is also some mature themes that are thrown into the movie as well. Even if parents are okay with the idea of having their children watch Princess Mononoke, there are a lot of things in this movie that kids wouldn't respond or understand too well. It has a complex story that has mature concepts that are mixed in a blender with a big weight on subtext and has great depth in writing that is made by the same man that gave us the cutesy magically charmed animated beloved classics such as My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service. This is a man who happens to be an environmentalist, a pacifist, and a feminist. I think us otakus know full well that this is present in all of his films. Princess Mononoke is obviously an environmental film that might as well be called an environmental epic. The reason I consider it to be an environmental epic is because the atmosphere in Princess Mononoke (in a metaphorical sense) brings a lot of wonder and mysticism as well as having a vast landscape with vivid imagery that I think all people that watch movies can appreciate the extremely detailed animation in all its beauty. I think we can all agree that all the Studio Ghibli films are gorgeous. Princess Mononoke is so well detailed with a sense of realism in the ancient fantasy world that is shown in this film. The production value somehow bolsters and supports the writing (strangely enough). Even though the setting is in an ancient fantasy world, the realistic aspect is that it has a conflict in a world that could reflect on our own. With all the background info on the animation said, Here's what I think of the animation. It is beyond gorgeous, It is the most majestic and breathtaking film that Hayao Miyazaki has ever produced. Every scene from beginning to end is a visual tour de force and a Thanksgiving Dinner to the eye. It is so well-detailed which it comes to no surprise as to why this is considered Miyazaki-san's masterpiece and magnum opus. This is a real treat to animation lovers and otakus alike.\n\nThe music by Joe Hisaishi compliments every scene in Princess Mononoke and is a great listen without the movie. If Miyazaki-san is compared to Walt Disney, I guess it could be fair to say that Joe Hisaishi could be compared to John Williams. Walt Disney was a wonderful animator in the U.S. and Hayao Miyazaki is still a wonderful animator in Japan. Joe Hisaishi and John Williams are also wonderful music composers as well in their respective countries. The music is beautiful and always makes the worlds that Miyazaki-san creates feel magical and wonderful. Joe Hisaishi is a very talented composer and is easily one of my favorite composers in anime alongside Yoko Kanno, Shiro Sagisu, and Taku Iwasaki. Princess Mononoke is one of his more recognized film scores but the music Princess Mononoke has adds up to the \"majestic\" quality that this film has.\n\n\n\nThe Japanese cast performs quite well in this movie and I should point out that you'll get a better understanding in cultural settings as well as Japanese mythology (possibly religion too) if you watch this film in subtitled form. The Japanese cast is well casted in this film. Yoji Matsuda is terrific as Prince Ashitaka, Yuriko Ishida has a believable voice as San, Yuko Tanaka is great as Lady Eboshi. I think I know what you're thinking. You are probably wondering what I think of the English Dub of Princess Mononoke. Before I tell you that, I will share some background info on the dub which is somewhat relevant to what I think of it. Back at the time that this movie was picked up in the U.S. Disney had a thing where all the Studio Ghibli films would be licensed and distributed stateside by Disney. Disney decided not to pick this movie up because of its content and everyone knows that Disney is known for its family-friendly flicks and most of the crappy TV shows they have on their channel. Instead, we have Miramax Films which is a subsidiary to The Walt Disney Company that picked up Princess Mononoke and the English Dub is often the most debated in all the dubbed Ghibli films. While Princess Mononoke was picked up, Harvey Weinstein who was the chairman for Miramax at the time (or still is) gave the ADR voice directing role to Neil Gaiman, for those who are literary buffs out there, it's that Neil Gaiman. I've never read any of his books but he has written some fantasy books in the past and even wrote with Terry Pratchett on the book Good Omens, If you don't know who Terry Pratchett is, he is a fantasy writer best known for the Discworld books. Anyway, Since Neil Gaiman wrote some fantasy stories, it's probably safe to say that he knew what he was doing while writing the adaptive English script of Princess Mononoke. The end result leads to Princess Mononoke being one of the best dubs for a Studio Ghibli film and probably the best of the Ghibli dubs. Before you go all angry on me, let me me explain. First of all, the dialogue in the English script is spoken well because Neil Gaiman really appreciates the beauty of the English language. Secondly, the dub is performed extremely well. I know that Princess Mononoke has the most debated dub in the Ghibli films so let me explain right here and now. I think most people agree that Billy Crudup is an excellent Ashitaka and you can tell because he sounds like he's extremely invested in the role too. Claire Danes as San is one of those performances that people debate over and I understand that but her performance was great. What I think people don't like is how her voice sounds, I think what people tend to see towards San is that she is some kind of brave leader and she didn't sound like that at all. Claire Danes' portrayal of San is angry, immature, and upset and that's San's character. I honestly can say that I got used to Claire Danes' performance in the dub. Minnie Driver is terrific as Lady Eboshi because she has that confident sounding voice which she pulled off quite nicely. She sounds like someone you could trust. Another debatable role would be Moro which is voiced by Gillian Anderson in the dub while Akihiro Miwa voices her in the subtitled version. The reason this role is debated sometimes is because the voices sound different from one to the other. That is because Moro's seiyu is male and Moro has a male voice. The reasoning for this is because according to Japanese Mythology or Spirituality, Wolves are considered one of the most divine animals and would always speak in a male voice typically. This is why Moro has a male voice in the Japanese version. This is not the case for the dub because it might have not made any sense to us Americans but Gillian Anderson is also terrific as Moro. No one has said a bad thing about Keith David as Okkoto and I guess that's somewhat good because Keith David was also great as Okkoto. The last debatable dub role that I haven't mentioned yet is Billy Bob Thornton which he really is a great actor, but I completely understand where people are getting at with Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo (Jiko-bo in the Japanese version). I will admit that he was great as Jigo but he sounds a bit different than Jigo's seiyu. Some say that Billy Bob Thornton does not fit the Japanese intent of Jigo's character. Jigo is a well-written character that even though he is a bit of a corrupt monk but some other characters trust him and Billy Bob Thornton has that kind of voice that sounds like you could trust him, that is until later in the movie. There are some nice extras in both versions. So here's what I think of the dub, even though it's the most debated dub of the Ghibli films, I think it is performed extremely well even if some characters sound a bit off. I really like the dub to Princess Mononoke, I also like the Subtitled version as well so this is a movie that I like both versions to.\n\n\n\nAs far as characters go, there are quite some interesting ones. Prince Ashitaka is a young confident warrior that is trying to save his own life while trying to simmer down the hatred between the humans and the beings of the forest (which includes San). San is portrayed nicely because even though she's human, she is raised by wolves and she is obviously trying to defend the forest because it is technically her home. She does have a hatred towards humans even though she's human herself and that made her quite a fascinating character. Lady Eboshi on the other hand is kind of a villain-ish character but she is not completely evil, she's actually compassionate towards people who are defenseless, which is ironic to say that least since because she brings ruin to parts of the forest. Jigo is a well-written character and there's really not much I have to say about him except for that I thought he was nice until he ended up being a bit of a corrupt monk unless I've spoken wrong about the whole \"corrupt monk\" thing. Moro is interesting to watch since she's one of the spirits of the forest (Wolf-God, Wolf-Goddess, whatever she is.) Okkoto was another character I thought was interesting because he's sort of a key character later in the movie. If Toki was the comic relief character in the movie, her character was good enough for that.\n\n\nWhen it comes to the story, this has to be the hardest thing for me to discuss because there is so much to talk about when it comes up to the story of Princess Mononoke, it is such a complex tale. I've said earlier that this movie is a visual tour de force and a Thanksgiving Dinner to the eye, that does not mean that you need to turn your brain off at the same time, OH, no, no, no, no, NO! You need to pay attention while watching this film because it is a bit complex and for good reasons. There is a lot going on. What is portrayed well is nature itself. Not only is environmental nature portrayed well, human nature is also portrayed quite well. What really is quite effective is that there are no villians in this movie, Lady Eboshi is not a villian in Princess Mononoke. She is doing a little bad just so she can help her own people. This is the kind of movie you can really sympathize with the characters for whatever society or some people think is \"Bad\" because this movie really wants you to think that they deserve to exist as we do. That is probably the strongest element in the movie and it is enough to get the message of the movie across because nature isn't pure good and we are not pure evil and not taking over the defenselessness of nature and we are not being at fault for doing the wrong thing by nature either because nature isn't completely defenseless but neither is in a position of moral superiority. It just exists, like all of us. If there are any flaws that some people address that I really don't see a flaw to would be Prince Ashitaka from beginning to end. I've read some comments somewhere that Prince Ashitaka sort of comes out of nowhere and has no character traits except for the fact that he falls in love with San while being the bridge that will bring the two worlds together since San is from the world of the Forest Spirits (in a metaphorical sense) while Ashitaka is in the human world. To be honest, there is a bridge between the two. Ashitaka is not necessarily from the human world either. He's not a force of pure good at all and there is not force of pure good or pure evil in this movie at all. Everything Ashitaka does is just so he can survive. He is the last of his people and he is also the hero because he has to be the one to save his own life. If this still hasn't convinced you yet, let me make it clear then. If he didn't have that curse in his arm, he would've been a boring chararacter. He has valid motivations, he has desires to kill, he can get angry, he does fall in love. He is a believable character if you pay attention. He also brings an interesting weight to the story thematically. There are these two polar forces that are going at eachother which we already know is Lady Eboshi's group and the beings of the Forest. Both are not sides of pure good or pure evil and you have these bridges that are between them. Ashitaka is that bridge, so is San. It is sort of brilliant in a thematic way. San is the brave warrior of the Forest Gods but she's not really one of them, that is why she's the bridge. Ashitaka is a warrior for the human side but sort of isn't one of them either. The Japanese people portrayed in this story aren't really his people because he's the last of the Emishi people and he is trying to survive on his own by associating with these people that drove his tribe out and they eventually went extinct (what I'm saying is a part of Japanese history) Ashitaka does not have a direct reason to help the human side although he sort of does, the same goes for San as well, she's human, so she shouldn't really be trying to kill one of her own kind, but it's not hers. When it comes to both sides, they are the last of their kind or maybe even the only of their kind and they are trying to survive and exist. There is an extension of a pure force on either force that cannot link together and cannot reconcile as well as a force that can't achieve balance. The key to balance in both of them is an impartial member from both sides that come together to solve the issue. All out of the need to survive from the individual, to the group, and to the force at large which really can be the essence of balance which is kind of the need to push forward and continue to exist. Ashitaka was a fascinating character to me. Now that may be a complex subject to swallow but this does all add up to a fascinating story that can make you root for both sides which is one hell of an accomplishment. It also touches on the human condition in such a unique way. As a humanist myself, I think it's safe to say that human nature has some part in all that which Princess Mononoke does portray. There's so much more to this movie than meets the eye and that's the one thing I truly admire in this movie. I tip my hat to Miyazaki-san for being blessed with such talent and showcasing his masterpiece which is this film.\n\nPrincess Mononoke is available from Miramax Films\n\nWith all that said, Princess Mononoke is a film that has a fascinating story with well-written characters, spellbinding music, and majestic animation. This is undeniably one of Hayao Miyazaki's best films since it has been critically acclaimed that even films critics such as Roger Ebert gave praise towards Princess Mononoke. I consider myself an unofficial critic and I've already gave enough praise towards this film. This is a movie that I can watch over and over again and not really get tired of it. There's always something new that I learn with repeated viewing. This is a movie that I really don't see anything at fault. It's for environmentalists, animation buffs, and otakus alike. I have almost seen all of Hayao Miyazaki's films and out of all of them, Princess Mononoke is my favorite Miyazaki film. If you haven't seen this movie, you must see it. Some will tell you that it is incredible, some will say it's gorgeous. What I can tell you is that it is an unforgettable experience\n\nI give Princess Mononoke a 10 out of 10, it is a MASTERPIECE!\n\nFeel free to leave a comment and try to live your life to the fullest. \n        "},

The lore is quite basic, even though the subtle references to feudal Japan are more than present. So you have monsters who want to protect the magical forest, villagers who want to stay alive and work hard to get resources and habitation from nature and some samurai warlord who wants the head of a mythological god or something to become immortal and also some iron from the village. The atmosphere\n          \n        built is serious and there's a lot of blood and violence going on. Action scenes are kind of realistic since the physics is not deformed and despite having a lot of magic, you can't say the show is innocent or childish. The movie purpose seems to be showing that every side has its interests and that nothing is easily resolved, there are always negative consequences. While that works on a superficial level though, the resolution is actually pretty easy. Yes, a lot of people die, but none of them matter unless you care about the wolves. Both female leaders live and the protagonist also is cured of his problem, you know, so he can meet the girl someday and have children or whatever. There's not too much of infodump and people are not stupid to progress the plot forward. It's overall well written, but it doesn't have that single moment of actual impact in my opinion. Its message is pretty clear, its conclusion felt as magical as the god on the story and well, that's it. Rounded, objective and very well produced. The three protagonists are idealized, mostly the guy that's the male version of Mary Sue. This guy can do whatever he wants due to his illness and is also good and right all the time. Typical from Miyazaki, he never creates a great protagonist, but he makes some decent foils, like Kushana 2.0, aka, Eboshi, that along with San are the only interesting characters in the show. They feel human and real because of their flawed moral. You can sympathize with the old creepy guy, but that's just because he knows some moves. In sum, convenient but effective in the long run. Good as a whole, but didn't hit hard enough at one specific point.\nCinematography - It's very good. The action scenes are among the best I've ever seen. For some reason, the character design of female characters is rather generic while male ones are quite well done. They do a great job at portraying Japan's style and culture through visuals, it's not that easy. Ghibli being Ghibli, I don't see any reason to go further on that. Be sure it's good enough.\nSound - Voices are kind of normal when not forced. I understand monsters gotta have a hell of a different voice, but some men talk forced for no reason. It's cultural I guess. About the silent moments, I appreciate them a lot. Not really silent since there's background music playing, but no one says a word. When the protagonist meets San at the river and they just look at each other, the scene was perfect. He screamed right after but, apparently, he had to. The sound effects are top-notch and the soundtrack is good, but not impressive or special.\n1234 - The guy had his arm bitten by a monster and while marked to die developed super strength. That served of course for him to do a lot of stuff that would be simply impossible to make through another method and honestly, that sucks. I don't like magic when it serves to solve problems and when in the end the payoff is convenient af. The guy dodges every arrow in existence from any angle imaginable whenever he wants to. The protagonists survive to a lot of shit that's impossible of going through. Of course, they have to live, so why putting them in such a dangerous situation to begin with? A lot of people die, the village is destroyed but the two main characters are safe and even healed because the forest's god said so. Quite convenient in my opinion. Important characters are beautiful, non-important are not. Quite common in Miyazaki's works, you already know who's the perfect snowflake by looking at him. You already know he's not going to die and will survive to whatever shit he faces. Kind of annoying to be honest, why does everything have to be so pretty when important and/or good? Perfect Blue has a reason to make some things pretty due to its social criticism, but this here is just for the sake of appeal. If the boy were as 'handsome' as the other men in the show I would be surprised, but it's way better than having such a scarecrow boring face.\nIt's very well-made and offers more than just 'good nature, bad humans'. There's good action, good moments and good characters doing exciting stuff and running for their lives. It's not so impactful or thought-provoking, but it surely deserves to be watched. The End.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Mononoke Hime is a wonderful piece of animation, not only because of its visual beauty or atmospheric seriousness, but because of its ability to connect both grey morality and magical optimistic ambiance. While Ghibli’s other works focus too much on either being shallowly pretty or pro-environment aesopish, this one is the fusion of straight themes and charming epicness. After all, if it is animation then animate. Use your visual creativity to convey messages that otherwise wouldn’t be able of being conveyed.\nThe story follows a protagonist who’s searching for solutions to some sort of illness he happened to acquire while fighting against a giant hatred-possessed boar.\n          \n        Among the people he encountered is a warlord whose purpose is to provide shelter and work to the unfortunate who happens to be in conflict with the Princess Mononoke herself, a wolf-raised girl that fights against the humans’ advance towards the forest along with a lot of other entities. Entities that are not very fond of humanity and their greed and disrespect and who’re willing to fight back. However, the conflict extends to not only two sides, but three when another warlord decides to request abusive part of profits from the first one and also wants to achieve immortality by obtaining the head of a certain deity, the Great Forest Spirit. So you have this clash between various sides that are in search for their place in a newly established order. Obviously, not your classical and overused ‘bad humans, poor forest’ since humanity is in fact struggling and at least concerning the Iron City, people are indeed just surviving and trying to fix their problems. Not a mischievous cynical expansion for the evulz, but rather a natural and believable approach on the society, both of humans and animals, that are above everything seeking for their own. Things don’t get better with time and by the end a near-apocalipse happens to kill many, destroying the city and all because of irrational hatred and inability of proper communication. The big message of the movie is about the consequences of a conflict rather than its causes, since as it is obvious we never come to know why and how exactly the problems began. By the end, a massive restoration occurs and while I’m not really a fan of this specific way of ending something, it was foreshadowed that the Forest Spirit’s healing capacities were enough to solve several human conditions, including the aforementioned protagonist’s illness.\nAs always, you can’t expect from Miyazaki characters below the line of grey personality, at least not the main ones. However, I also cannot expect a not idealized protagonist from him either. Even the flaws of said characters serve only to emphasize their perfection and sense of justice. Mononoke Hime’s protagonist, who’s not Mononoke Hime by the way, is a very skilled, just, kind and smart being who always, always do the right thing. While you can see Nausicaa’s berserk mode revealing her dark side, this one is just too idealized for me. He’s searching for the truth, he gets angry by unfairness and fights back against those who attempt to impede his journey, you know, the basic. You also have the other perfect girl who isn’t that perfect and whose moral code is basically ‘I hate humans, but I don’t kill humans, with exception of that miserable bitch’. She’s a very concerned daughter of a giant wolf and isn’t afraid of doing some parkour within the city where literally every citizen is ready and loaded to blow her brains out with some “high-tech” machinery. However, as always, my favorite is the anti-ideal and usually only understood through time characters, also known in this series as Eboshi or Mononke’s Kushana, call at your will. She’s a strong, independent, smart and confident woman that despite appearing at first, mainly due to her naughty glance and suspicious quási-wicked laugh, your new villainous lady, it is, in reality, the most humane leader of this show. Only a bold charismatic mistress can lead with such success and raise so much loyalty from her commoners. She’s the cause of several deaths and immense destruction, but I doubt you can hate her or merely disregard her reasons to do so. Ignorance is something lady Eboshi easily shares with the other sides of this war, but she’s maybe the only one you can really relate yourself with, since your alternatives are basically animals who blatantly hate humans, some bland samurais whose only purpose was to attack the Iron City and two protagonists who are just an idealized couple of wild kids that’ll not date afterwards. I wouldn’t go as far as saying the show is story-driven, but the characters are just and simple what they were supposed to be in order to carry the plot forward, so there’s no need for extending on this subject.\nThe animation is beyond just fluid, it’s challenging. Situations not commonly seen, like ghost burning worms growing from a boar’s skin, curving due sunlight and their interaction when characters met their edges. The combat between peasants and samurais, full of blood and maiming, heads floating, arrows flying, hitting and ripping limbs. Violent, but realistic. Best animated parkour I’ve seen, weight calculated and balanced by the show’s own rules of physics and ingenious choreography that makes sense and whose speed resembles reality. So, as you can see, both through fantastical unimaginable or extremely loyal to reality’s situations, the show establishes of seriousness not commonly seen in anime. It’s not the only atmosphere they want to establish though. This is a japanese movie that does justice to its origins and represents well enough the environment of a feudal setting from early Japan, the guns are faithful to reality since there were indeed machines just like those at the time of 15th and 16th centuries and even the furnace is perfectly depicted within the boundaries of reality, since it’s almost exactly like a real furnace of its time. I’m amazed by their capacity of joining such a realistic approach upon magical phenomenons without losing grasp or charm throughout the entire film.\nWhile the soundtrack may not outstand itself that much, it’s cool, I gotta praise the sound effects utilized, they’re simply gorgeous. I don’t think most people are used to the natural sound of an arrow cutting the air and entering gently inside a piece of wood or even the ground, but those who are will notice how faithful and varied is the usage of it in this movie. I don’t know if every arrow has its distinct sound effect, but it seems that way. Also, steps on the roof of houses, cannon shots, blades colliding, the furnace in operation, every small thing contains a specific fitting sound and that only demonstrates the amount of effort that was put into this. I honestly liked more the silent moments where everything you can hear are the sounds of nature or heavy machinery or whatever, than the soundtrack. The latter is very good, but the good you are already used to. Nothing earworming like Nausicaa for example, just the classic Ghibli composed tracks of piano and violin, maybe a flute, I don’t really remember since I wasn’t that captivated by it.\nSo, besides the aforementioned idealization of characters and I must add, the fact Miyazaki really likes beautiful characters and by their beauty you already assume they’re or aren’t going to die, this movie is enough on its own to easily surpass mediocrity and strides towards the top of animated movies with its clever usage of animation, imaginative and at the same time faithful setting and scenarios, and serious grey story where things are not easily dealt with. As a matter of fact, there’re some annoying plot-armor moments and god, the protagonist will dodge every arrow imaginable from whichever angle possible. Also, the goo at the end is apparently simply unable of reaching them unlike everyone else, which is funny. Its conclusion is similar to Nausicaa movie’s one in many ways, and that’s not actually good since things get easily resolved after all. It’s not like Nausicaa’s manga for example, where Miyzaki was super inspired and represented so many things in a short amount of time with so much success and whose conclusion is beyond thought-provoking. So overall, great movie and very recommendable.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Mononoke Hime is a 1997 Studio Ghibli film written and directed by the legendary Miyazaki Hayao. It's also frequently brought up alongside Nausicaä & Spirited Away as one of Ghibli's classics. Does it hold up as well as those two films? Let's take a look. \nStory:\nWe open in a small village coming under attack by a demon God, which looks kind of like a boar covered in small, squat tendrils. In order to protect his people, Prince Ashitaka rides into action. He manages to stop the rampaging beast, but its tendrils grasp his arm, leaving a scar that won't abate and continues to increase in\n          \n        size. He's told that it's  curse and will eventually claim his life. So, his people send him out into the world to try and find a cure while examining things with unveiled eyes. It doesn't take him long to encounter a situation where the people of a prosperous little town seem to be at war with the creatures of the forest, including a girl who lives with the wolves as one of their own. \nI can't really criticise anything about the narrative in this film. The pacing is perfect, using slow and atmospheric scenes as well as more tense action scenes effectively while striking a good balance betwixt the two. The major theme concerning humanity and how we interact with the environment is superbly handled, aided by the fact that the opposing sides are both portrayed as sympathetic and as having some validity to their viewpoints. While our main protagonist tries to encourage a balanced approach. The scope itself is also really grandiose, in spite of most of the action occurring in one city and the adjacent forest. The climax is excellent, with a pressing problem and our heroes  being very much on a timer, which helps make it a very intense experience. I also appreciate that not everything gets wrapped up. We're ultimately shown a situation that's going to require more work but it still ends on a satisfying note in spite of that. \nCharacters:\nThe characters are about as expertly done as you can get. While it is true that the side characters are less developed, they still have verisimilitude. You can very much look at them and see them like actual people. I also do like that all the major characters have sympathetic aspects to them,. They all have things at stake that they don't want to surrender and there are compelling reasons for them to not just sit down and come to a compromise even though it would ultimately be to their benefit to do so. Having an outsider like Ashitaka as the main focus character allows the film to examine both sides of the conflict and see that balance in a way that the characters involved in it can't. I also do love San and her lupine family. A lot of works centring around a “feral” child raised by animals will focus on the more beastly aspects but this one shows a lot of the tenderness and love that you see from actual wolves when they interact with their cubs. Which also, in an odd way, lends a very human element to it. \nArt:\nThe artwork and animation are fantastic. The world the film creates is lively, vivid and even sublime. The backgrounds are really well detailed. The fantastic creatures of various varieties are fascinating and just have amazing designs. The animals and people are nicely detailed. The action sequences are awesome. It's just an excellent looking film. Which isn't all that surprising given that Studio Ghibli is known for their superb artwork. Even the films of theirs that I wasn't fond of have had amazing animation. \nSound:\nThe vocal work was really well done. Ishida Yuriko, Matsuda Youji & Miwa Akihiro in particular just gave outstanding performances. The music composition was handled by Hisaishi Joe, who also worked on the music in Ponyo, Howl's Moving Castle & Spirited Away. His work in those was all very well done and pleasant, but this film might have the best I've heard from him. The compositions are stupendous and really add to the atmosphere. \nHo-yay:\nThere isn't any. What little romance we get is het. \nFinal Thoughts:\nMononoke Hime is just fantastic. The atmosphere, story, characters, artwork, music and acting are all excellent. It absolutely deserves a spot among Ghibli's finest films. My final rating for it is going to be a 10/10. If you want to see a fantasy film with some amazing action & a nuanced approach when it comes to its environmental themes, I highly recommend it. So, that's it for film festival week. Next Wednesday I'll return to my weekly schedule with a look at Terra Formars: Revenge.\n        "},

Although movies like Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle are great, Princess Mononoke gives a different vibe that deals with the battle between man and nature. I really fell in love with the characters; San who tries to protect the forest along with her wolf tribe-family, and Ashitaka who takes no sides and wishes for peace. There's definitely scenes that I found scary as a child, but even now I'd get goosebumps when the movie takes a darker turn.

Same couple that directed and produced the award-winning Spirited Away, and How's Moving Castle. This couple, have blessed us with the best and most known Anime Movies ever. And I'm personally very grateful for the experience I get from watching these.\n\nStory: 10\nThe story was amazing, unique, exciting, warm and also, a little traditional.\nIt is Action, Adventure, Fantasy genres. I would say minor Romance as well.\nHumans, spirits, demons, and conversations between them.\nIt's about a young prince (Ashitaka)\n          \n        that haft to leave his village to save his own life from a curse.\nOn his journey, he meets a beautiful young lady that thinks she is a wolf (San) and lives with the wolf tribe. She wants to protect the forest and the forests spirit from being destroyed. And she hates Humans because of it.\nBy doing so she lives until the death of a Woman who runs an Iron-forge (Lady Eboshi), near the forest that destroys the forest for the need of Wood to make Iron so they as well can survive.\nStory continues with battles of greed, love and survival. Ashitaka need to find the God of the Forest to cure his wound that threatens his life. San wants to kill the Lady Eboshi so she can save the Forest from dying. And it gets complicated because of Ashitakas pure and kind heart that makes him want to save simply everything and everyone.\n\nArt: I give it a 10.\n The Art is amazing for such an old movie that aired for the first time in 1997. It's well made and I like ghibli as they call it, I would say old school anime, because it looks so much more natural, no extreme colours or eyes or hair. It gives the environment and everything a more realistic feeling. Its very smooth looking and beautiful. The evil creatures look horrifying and as in the movie they call them Demons and it doesn't look anything but demonic. Great art.\n\nSound: 10. \nVoice acting amazing. Its natural and smooth and nothing sounds fake or bad even when they are talking to animals. There is good emotions in this movie and I can very easily feel sympathy.\nMusic is amazing, it gives awesome atmospheres and fits so well to this. None the less from Joe Hisaishi that made made the music and theme for this. Aswell he did it for Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle.\n\nCharacter: 10!\nGreat characters. Ashitaka is compassionate, loving and caring. Even when his life is sure to end by a curse he got from defending his village, he lives on and tries his best to help others.\nSan, a human living in harmony with animals and nature. Something we can relate to in a few ways. She is assertive and asks no questions when it comes to the well being of the forest and her tribe. As shown by her will to kill Lady Eboshi.\nAnd Lady Eboshi, takes leadership as a man and at the same time shows compassion. She helps those that everyone is afraid of to live a good life. She shows her bad sides when she wants to take her compassionate side to a whole new level. Which makes the forest and animals suffer. She cares for humans, but not the nature and animals.\nEveryone else of the human characters are simply human. Doing their best to live a good life and cares for their loved ones.\nIt's a good balance with good and bad people. Though no one is truly evil in this movie.\n\nEnjoyment: 10\nThis movie is superbly great for anyone who just want to watch something that will grab your attention. Or for anyone who wants to go deep in to the story and emotions which is displayed.\nI personally love this movie a lot and I like the main male characters personality a lot It's very enjoyable to see such pure fighting hearts and it's wish able that such would exists more.\nI saw this movie actually for the first time 2 weeks ago. And i've already seen it 5 times and can easily go watch it again.\n\nOverall: 10. This is a masterpiece.\nThis is a great movie and I cannot find anything at fault with it. Great fantasy story with lovely emotions and story. It has a slight romance and comedy as well to just fill that little hole that made this a masterpiece.\nAlso, I didn't realise I had misunderstood a part of the ending until the third time watching it.\n Since this is my first review people may think negative about this review.

Without a doubt, definitely in my top 5 directors of all time along with Scorsese, Kurosawa, Hitchcock, and Leone. Including Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke is one of his masterpieces. The plot here is about our main protagonist,  Ashitaka, trying to find a cure for a curse given  to him by a boar god, after an attack on his village. During his journey he meets a monk named Jigo, who tells him that his best chance to rid himself of the curse is to seek out\n          \n        the Great Forest Spirit. Later on, Ashitaka eventually gets caught up with a conflict between a town and the guardians of the forest. Now this is one of the many great aspects of Princess Monoke; there are no good guys or bad guys. Both the forest gods and the towns people,  have  justifiable reasons for why they are involved in this whole situation. No character here is down right evil nor good; each one has their own faults and setbacks. The film very much explores the grey areas of morality(similar to Clint Eastwood’s Unforgiven). Through out the movie, you’ll question who here is right and who is wrong. Which perfectly adds a layer of depth and complexity to the plot; so yeah, this definitely isn’t your conventional narrative as expected from an innovator like Miyazaki. To top it off, the narrative is filled with fantastic action and stunning set pieces; so there isn’t a dull moment. Thematically, Princess Mononoke mainly delves into the theme of  man vs. environment, a trademark of Miyazaki directorial style, and I got say that he handles it most effectively here.  In regards to the score, it doesn’t disappoint. A lot of it is orchestrated which fits in perfectly with the epic scope and grandeur of the film, complementing the tone and atmosphere of the experience.  In terms of production values, Studio Ghibli delivers some of the most breathtaking animation that you’ll ever see as always; seriously, this film is an orgasm for the eyes. With the art style included,  from the beautiful panoramic shots of the landscape, to the well choreographed action sequences, to the character designs, it’s pretty much perfect. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the CGI. Originally, when I first watched this film, I was shocked when I found out that it actually incorporated CGI. I mean, they did a magnificent job of blending both traditional hand drawn 2D animation and 3D CG. This, in my opinion, is how CGI should be done when it‘s put into anime. It shouldn’t stick out like a sore thumb. CGI should be smoothly incorporated when being used simultaneously along with 2D animation. Just pay close attention to the scene where Ashitaka took out those group of bandits after he had receive the curse, and you’ll see what I mean.  Overall, this is a mandatory viewing for not only anime fans but film buffs as well. It’s a personal favorite of mine and I highly, highly, highly recommend it. "},

(Two for the Price of one, Yay! xD) The first scenario dealt with a prince who had been bestowed by a curse and must travel the mountains to find a cure by a Spirit God. The second scenario dealt with the animals living in the mountains waging war against the humans who constantly destroy their forests as well as hunt for the Spirit God. In the end, the two scenarios merge and conclude together. To start off, the themes of this story are powerful morals which are displayed wonderfully and provokes discussion way after the credits roll. The first half of the film dealt with the pursuit of Peace and to abolish all hate for one another since the curse fed off the people's hatred. The last half of the film focused more on trying to save the environment and wildlife; as well as to live in harmony with one another. The actions in the story show strong symbolism that's easily understandable and may change the way you look at forests differently. This is for sure a movie that both kids and adults can enjoy!\nThe negatives I had with the show lie more on technical and execution issues. The first problem being the pacing. The first half of the film had a dramatically slow pace; as we saw our hero travel to different lands, showcasing his journey to get to the forest. We see our hero converse with others in wonderful dialogue; but I never truly got that feeling of urgency that the protagonist might be in any danger because of his curse, since he would occasionally stop to help out injured people. I could tell that Miyazaki tried spending the first half showcasing the setting our hero would be involved in, but even still, this movie took quite some time to get going. The second half of the film is where we see the action begin to pick up as war is broken loose between the animals and humans. The pacing of this segment does pick up, but like the first half, I never felt any urgency when we would see the two sides waging war or experience the impact when a person or an animal would die. This is all due to the fact that the second half is based on several different point of views. Because of this, I found the story to be convoluted as it would jump to various battles; making me confused time to time as to what each person's specific goal was. Another issue I had was the ending. By the conclusion of the film, all the situations were settled but I never truly felt resolution between the two opposing sides; even though the actions of the movie made me think other wise. Looking from it at a realistic stand point, the ending truly is fitting but because of this, it kind of contradicts the whole set up of the second half of the film.\n7/10\nArt:\nThe art of Princess Mononoke is standard level for a Miyazaki film: BEAUTIFUL! Since most of the film is in the wild life, the scenery of these forests are well done: full of lush greenery and very detailed animal drawings. Blood from a wolf or guck from a Boars mouth are very descriptive and for an action movie, the swings from a sword or a shot from an arro feels very realistic since time to time, body parts will get severed at a graphically gruesome rate. This is for sure one of Miyazaki's more mature styled films. The art of Princess Mononoke is something that tells a story on it's own and can even hold up with some of today's work in terms of detail.\n10/10\nSound:\nThe sound of Princess Mononoke is probably one of the more disappointing aspects of the film, as I tend to even notice or remember any pieces from the movie. Instead I can only remember the noise that the Wild Life would make or sound effects such as the splashing made when walking in water. To me, I found the sound of Princess Mononoke was only there to compliment rather than generate any emotion than what it's future successors would do later.\n6/10\nCharacters:\nThe characters in Princess Mononoke are interesting. To begin, you have your normal protagonists, Ashitaka and later, San. What makes this story interesting though was no side is truly evil. Along the way Ashitaka will encounter different people that you will later see again but as he converses with these people, you can tell that each one of them doesn't have a very deep negative intention. However, I think that many will side with the Animals when watching since they are mostly the underdogs (No Pun intended) and they simply wish to preserve their land. This is in comparisons to the humans who more or less want to destroy the entire forest near the end. This was a very original approach since in life, people are almost never laid out as: good or bad, and instead it's all on how we perceive it to be.\nOn the other hand, lack of a clear villain can also be considered a flaw to the movie. It can be difficult to invest yourself with the characters since you don't know which one to root for. Because of this, it may take you out of the experience. Character development was another problem I had. Ashitaka encounters plenty of people along his journey, but I never saw him or anybody else grow because of these encounters. Also, I never saw San, our female protagonist as a vital part to the film. To me she was only there to provide a love interest with our main character, Ashitaka and unfortunately, needless to say: she too also didn't get any development and in the end she remained almost as the same person we were introduced to as.\n7/10\nOverall/Enjoyment:\nIn the end, Princess Mononoke is not the best Ghibli movie out there. Pacing issues, lack of a grounded OST, and weak character development prevent this movie from being a classic Ghibli film that can easily earn my first recommendation. I found myself currently being pulled out of the experience and checking my watch time to time with the slow movement this film had. Still, looking at the film as a whole, I had an immense amount of fun while watching it! This animation just overflowed with it's strong life lessons that doesn't take an expert to figure out. This was also accompanied by daring original concepts the movie challenged itself with and has been defined in its age as being one of the best! In the end you won't be in an urge to check your \"Ecological footprint\" but I guarantee that this is an anime, you won't wanna miss!\n7/10\n        "},

I have only seen 2 others - Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. This one is my favorite. It is the LOTR of anime for me.\nStory 9/10\nThe only thing not really 10/10. The story isn't really original. It is the same as Avatar (the \"blue people\" movie) or really any story about humans encroaching on nature. But that isn't to say it is well told. The fantasy elements bring a nice touch and the story never drags.\nArt 10/10\nNot necessarily a 10/10 for today's standards, but this art does stand\n          \n        up really well for its time. As with any Ghibli film, so much attention is put in the details. The characters were designed really well and the whole world put a spell on me.\nSound 10/10\nTHE. SOUNDTRACK. OMG. This is one of my all-time favorite soundtracks ever. From the beginning, it reminded me of playing Zelda (although I guess it should be the other way around). The music really makes this movie and it has not aged a bit.\nCharacter 10/10\nYou will see some other reviews point out how stoic the main character is. How he is heartless to the point of having no emotion. I love this. He is a strong character and a smart one too. As is the girl, San. There is no bigger turn off for me than a weak character and this movie has none of it.\nEnjoyment 10/10\nI was in a trance from beginning to end. A state of euphoria, if you will. This is one of the most enjoyable movies of all time for me.\nOVERALL 10/10\nThis is the LOTR of anime, please watch.\n        "},

There are a few reasons for this.  \n1)  The story actually has substance.  It isn't some little kid being sent off on a fool's errand to collect treasure or magical items.\n2)  You could consider this one of the more..... artistic works available.  Think of old Disney vs new Disney.  The solid outlines that bring definition to the characters.  \n3)  Sound..... well this one is a personal thing, but sound doesn't actually matter to me.  If I can tell\n          \n        something blew up, that's all I need.  I don't need to actual hear the direction it comes from.\n4)  Characters are all very well done, and well established.  Even minor characters are implemented so well, you actually care about them.\n5)  Without giving away anything, go into this movie expecting a well thought out story, great character development, and a very great delivery of itself.\nIf you enjoy Edo-Style anime, I would suggest checking this movie out.  It runs about 2 hours, so for an anime, its pretty long, and worth every second.\n        "},

I would have to say this movie is intriguing and amazingly well built. The art in this movie is fantastic and the soundtrack too. Its better than the traditional Ghibli movie. The plot is also intricately developed and very well built. The story begins with the prince of a small town somewhere in feudal Japan. Take in to matter than most ghibli movies contain some sort of spiritual or magical aspect within the story. On one normal day, a rampaging boar suddenly starts going berserk and heads toward the village. The\n          \n        boar is taken down, but the MC acquires a curse inadvertently, and is banned from the village as a result. The curse on the boar was placed by a being known as the spirit of the forest, the boar was deliberately sent to that village in order to get revenge on the humans for massively abusing and damaging the environment. The MC has to find the spirit of the forest and somehow find a way to remove the curse to save himself before he meets his fate. Awesome plot start there in my opinion. While watching this movie, you develop a really good liking to these characters and their influence among the entire story. If you are a diehard fan of Ghibli movies, then this a must watch for you!\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="                          \n    Ooo what is this? Miyazaki making an anime that targets older audiences? If it wasn't for the knowledge that I had before hand, I'm not sure I could have identified \"Princess Mononoke\" as Miyazaki's handiwork very easily. In fact the only thing that might have given it away is design of the main protagonist Ashitaka, who's appearance reminds me of Haku from \"Spirited Away\". The story of \"Princess Mononoke\" essentially revolves around Ashitaka, the prince of a tribal village, going on a journey to try and lift a curse that he has been afflicted with.\nCompared to the other Miyazaki films I've seen, \"Princess Mononoke\" is\n          \n        an unexpectedly grim piece of work. You can feel there's something different about this one from the intensity that's there right from the word go. The sight of the demon boar charging through the forest covered in those... maggot like things is quite unnerving. From there on, the show never lets up. People with their arms/head/ separated from the rest of the body; men and beast being slaughtered aplenty on the battlefield etc all contribute in making this film a rather \"heavy\" viewing experience.\nThe differences don't stop here either. Another thing that caught my attention is that it's not a typical Miyazaki main cast. The main character is a boy, and it's the girl who's the one taking the back seat in \"Princess Mononoke\". In fact, Princess Mononoke's involvement in the anime isn't that great at all, so I don't know why the title is named after her in the first place.\nDespite these differences, other more subtle elements that tend to come with Miyazaki works are actually firmly embedded in this film upon closer inspection. The great soundtrack that gives this work such an epic feel; the strange but wonderful \"monster\" designs (especially the the wood spirits that made me chuckle); and of course that all important magical element that's like the blood that courses thruogh the veins of pretty much all his work.\nThe older age bracket targetted by \"Princess Mononoke\" isn't limited to superficial features such as the bloodshed and brutality - it's something that extends to the maturity of the story line, a story line that looks to go beyond his usual wonderfully imagined but thematically simplistic adventure premises. I had heard before how Miyazaki's earlier work \"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds\" (or just \"Nausicaa\" for short) is often seen as a prototype of \"Princess Mononoke\", but didn't really know why until I watched this film. In essence, \"Princess Mononoke\" is a retelling of the same human vs nature theme that's the backbone of \"Nausicaa\". The big difference though, is the sense that \"Princess Mononoke\" is crafted by an older and wiser Miyazaki with a more rounded view of the world. As much as I like the rough charm of \"Nausicaa\", there's no denying that \"Princess Mononoke\" is the more mature work. Gone is the raw preachiness found in the earlier film, and in its place, there is a much more understanding tone, arising from a carefully constructed no-win situation that's all too easily belivable. In \"Princess Mononoke\", there are no real, big villains - everyone is just doing their best to survive in a harsh world. Which party is in the wrong in this conflict? The forest gods who are trying to prevent their homes from being destroyed? Or the ironworks people, rejects of society who finally found their place in the world, and are cutting down the forest in order to make a decent living?\nThere is no right answer, and \"Princess Mononoke\" recongises this. After all the bloodshed and slaughter, there is no magic solution to the conflict. What the film does offer though, is hope. Hope that the groups involved can find a way of living in harmony. It's a more realistic rather than a fairy tale ending where everyone comes away happy, and it's an ending that I really like.\nOn the art and animation side of things, this does seems to be one of the best looking Ghibli films, at least to me (but then, I'm not very good at judging the technical stuff, so what do I know). The imageries in the film are incredibly rich and colourful, with typically well drawn backgrounds that never fails to be anything other than beautiful and detailed. The action sequences are mostly fluid and dynamic, although I have to say that things like people's arms flying off look a bit odd - I guess Miyazaki just isn't used to drawing stuff like that :P\nIn the audio department, the music and the sound effects are of a high standard, really adding to the atmosphere, but some of the voice acting sounds a bit flat at times to me.\nDespite being the spirital successor to \"Nausicaa\", \"Princess Mononoke\" feels like a different beast from Miyazaki's other works. A thoughtful, sophisticated story told with startling intensity and naked savagery, \"Princess Mononoke\" is a fascinating watch and definitely one of Miyazaki's finest - right up there \"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds\" itself.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    Princess Mononoke - 6/10\nit's one of the few Midzayaki cartoons that isn't really for children as much as the others, has some very violent moments, but thankfully they aren't the centre of attention of this movie.\nThe plot follows a boy from a village who gets cursed during fighting a demon and is now seeking the spirit of the forest to beg for a cure.\nInstead he gets tangled in wars between regions for resources, and this is where the main point of this movie comes in, it's greed that makes humans want to claim things. \"Everyone wants everything, but i might actually get it\" and they\n          \n        don't care as to what happens to the surroundings, so they try to kill a god for their own greed, thinking that they are the god that can rule over everything.\nAs you can see the plot is pretty good, it is directed in such a way it gives a sense of an adventure, full of interesting, a little cliche but interesting characters.\nOne of my favorite things about this movie is the art. Holy shit it is all very smooth and drawn very well, looks like a little smoother version of 'Spirited Away' which is only to be expected from Studio Ghibli, but it is also drawn very nice, the blood isn't just red ketchup, and the animals all have their fur nicely detailed, most backgrounds are in late-80s style so i guess you'll either love it or hate it.\nOverall it's very enjoyable, stood the test of time very well, but kinda lacks a sound direction as in soundtrack, and also i just feel it kinda fails to achieve something more than just a good watch.\nNot bad though/\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    For those of you who haven't seen this film, I pity you. Out of all the masterpieces that the great Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghilibi have created, Mononoke Hime is the greatest one; easily my favorite movie as a child, and even today. Honestly, this movie isn't even for children unlike Miyazaki's other films. Thinking back on it now, I wonder why I loved the show so much considering I couldn't possible have understood the complexity and themes from the movie as a child. Perhaps it was just the natural beauty of the movie just like all of Miyazaki's films. Spirited Away? Totoro? Castle in\n          \n        the Sky? Howl's Moving Castle? Nausicaa Valley of the Wind? Kiki's Delivery Service? Sure, they're great in all, but nope, for me they're not even close to the greatness of Mononoke Hime. Why? Well, first of all I should point out that unlike Miyazaki's other films, Mononoke Hime is very violent and serious which is actually to my liking. Furthermore, the creativity, beauty, wondrous, sadness, darkness, and deepness level of Mononoke Hime is just unexplainable in words and nearly unmatchable by other films. The movie is a magical glimpse of what the real world, what our reality truly is behind the curtains of our own delusion and idealistic dreams... It is not a simplistic tale of good and evil, but the story of how humans are connected to the beauty and darkness of nature, and how all living things fight for their belief of the order and happiness, no one is truly wrong.\nThe story is set in medieval Japan, during the dawn of the Iron Age. Mankind still lived in harmony with nature but slowly mankind was trying to tame and overtake it. \nIn simplest form, the film revolves around a young prince of a tribe, Ashitaka who after having protected his village from the Boar God/Demon, inherits an incurable evil curse that's going to eventually kill him. In order to save himself from the curse, he travels into the great forest of the west with his trusted elk, Yakul. There, he plans to find the source of the iron ball, found in the decomposed body of the Boar, as a way of diminishing the curse's plague on his body. Once he reaches the forest however, he is caught up in the middle of a long raging war between the technologically advancing humans and the forest spirits, lead by the female protagonist, Princess Mononoke (San). Ashitaka's journey brings him to the situation where he must try to stem the flow of blood being spilt, reach out and show the good in both of the sides. This is met by animosity by the human and forest spirits and seeing him working to help each side leads to them approaching him as an enemy.\nI guarantee that you won't find Hollywood films as philosophical as this film. The obvious message of the film is to represent the relationship between humanity and nature. But even deeper within that outer layer, there are plenty of themes: such as the concept of \"right vs wrong\", \"good vs evil\", \"freedom vs confinement\", \"reality vs dreams\", and most importantly, \"technology-future vs agriculture-past\". Miyazaki doesn't only bash technology though, he shows that technology can be the demise of mankind as well as nature, but it can also be the greatest innovation ever if handled properly. The show shows being alive and being happy in any form in itself is a magical thing that people should appreciate. I could go on and on about the symbolism and themes, but moving onto why the show was enjoyable. The love in this show was handled beautifully (& metaphoric). Ashitaka and Princess Mononoke's lives and points of views differ despite them being in love. They realize that neither of them can really lead the life of the other, and so they learn to grant each other \"freedom\" (reality). There's no holding back despite it being a Ghibili film in the violence part of the show, which was a nice surprise. \nThe characters were symbolic figures rather than relatable and solely enjoyable to watch. Ashitaka symbolizes purity and innocence, which is what he loses when he kills the Boar (despite it being to protect his village), hence leading him to set off to the great forest of the west, to purify his curse/himself and repenting for his sins. San symbolizes the harmony between humanity and nature. San is a human despite living and fighting alongside nature, who become torn between her origins vs her ideals. Eboshi, who most people call \"the villain\" of the show symbolizes the evolution of humanity. But in Princess Mononoke, no character is intrinsically bad or good, just like in our reality which avoids the usual simplifications and shows the difficulty in judging things easily; there is no \"bad guy\". Lady Eboshi may be massacring the forest animals, but she is also rescuing prostitutes and lepers. Just like how San and her wolves may have killed humans, but they were merely defending the forest; their home. Genius.\nThe images are gorgeous, the lighting is amazing; concept of \"illuminating light at end of the dark tunnel\", and the lavish backgrounds of mankind's civilization vs mother nature: Perfection. The addition of forest spirits was beautiful as well. Furthermore, the portrayal of the animals of nature was like a shameless addition of magical icing on top of the perfect cake. I mean honestly, the great white wolves and their threatening look/teeth that give the message, \"mess with nature, and we're going to kill you filthy human beings\" to the sad writhing dying body of the boar (god). But, the character's I must admit aren't unique at all though... They look just like all of Studio Ghibili's film's characters, except with addition of \"nature\" on them. The realism of the show is scary as hell. The lush and lavish green forests --- Empty, destroyed wasteland. Animals scurrying around the woods --- extinction due to mankind's hunting. Vast beautiful trees --- dying trees, cut down trees. How can an anime have such beautiful art?\nDo I even have to say anything about the music? You already know that it's 10/10 stunning, beautiful, fitting to Miyazaki's films, masterpieces of music once you hear that Studio Ghibili + Joe Hisashi are involved. The music fits the film's themes and emotions by amplifying scenes level of emotion; Sadness, Pity, Anger, Violence, Ominous, and Love/Unification (between nature and humanity). \"Legend of Ashitaka\" is a piece that I've played in my orchestra; it is beautiful. Alongside Joe Hisashi's stacks of great music, Legend of Ashitaka tops it alongside other masterpieces such as Laputa (Castle in the Sky), One Summer's Day (Spirited Away) and Kaze no Toorimichi (Totoro). Of course, there are more than 1 good song, the entire soundtrack of Princess Mononoke was dazzling (another great piece is \"Journey to the West\"). The voicing of the characters (in japanese) gives the entire film a whole new level of feels. I want to mention that the dubbed version of Princess Mononoke isn't terrible, but it's certainly worse than the subbed version, so.. I recommend the sub if you haven't seen this masterpiece yet (what are you doing with your life, go watch the movie). Oh my goodness, I love Joe Hisashi's music... His music fits Miyazaki's films so well that it's scary. \nNow having said all of this, I hope you've either already seen the movie, or are planning to see it now, otherwise I don't know what you're doing with your life.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    For the second time watching this movie, I fell asleep in the middle of it. Interesting enough, this time I had paused the movie just before the part where Ashitaka wakes up in the forest as he's recovering from his injuries, such that I awoke as he did. That's a trivia unrelated to the movie plot for you. Let's move on.\nAmong all of Miyazaki's movies, Princess Mononoke is the director's most blatant attempt at criticizing deforestation and pollution thus far. The poisonous iron that kills the boar is obviously the tar that we spill into the ocean, and the rest of the parts about the\n          \n        dying forest speak for themselves. Frankly, I find the whole tree-hugging social commentary uninteresting, but Mononoke does offer a benefit over the more sermonizing Pocahontas and Avatar of America - it makes an attempt to show both side of the coin. By the end of it, there's still a one-dimensional antagonist trying to show how big and bad humanity is in his villainous attempt of destroying the precious forests, but at least this time, the anti-environmentalist humans get to tell their side of our story in industrialization and innovation.\nHuman innovation is a tricky subject to tackle in cinema. In real life, advancing our technology without provoking Greenpeace has become easier for (ironic enough) Japan, what with all the inventions that run on solar power and electricity as opposed to petrol and ore of the old days. In movies, however, our brilliant urge to advance towards bigger and shinier technology has often been hampered by cautionary tales of mad scientists and tree-haters. Instead of being proud about how far our species has come, we worry ourselves about other species when we can be the dominating species in real life. There are no monsters or aliens or magical deer gods to stop us in reality, so I guess it's appropriate that these are the stuff of fantasies, of fairy tales. Prometheus was right in granting man the gift of fire. Nolan was right about our gift of exploring interstellar travels. This is the nature of man we should be proud of, not be preached about by conservatives. If our advancement towards the future poses a problem, like the pollution of our home, we should merely fix it by crafting solar technology.\nAnd yet, the Japanese seems to be still rooted in ancient folklore and our place in nature. Many Japanese stories lecture about the fallacies in our disregard for Mother Earth, and Miyazaki certainly wasn't the first or the most prominent one. It's a balance that's admirable, I guess, how the most ambitious innovators of Earth are still honor-bound to the traditional ways of mankind.\nWhile I certainly have no love for Miyazaki's naive simplification of the truth about human innovation, I could admit that Mononoke is a well-crafted exception among his other works. Truthfully, I could respect Miyazaki's strive in setting a nuance between environmentalists and evil-doers. There's a fairly neutral theme at play throughout the movie. A particularly memorable line comes to mind: \"Life is suffering and pain. This world and its people are cursed, but we still wish to live.\" Rather than taking the side of Mononoke and the 'heroes' of this movie, I'm more inclined towards the motivations of Eboshi and her brave ambitions to pursue her own goals - no matter the cost. This tireless ambition to 'live' is perhaps the curse mentioned here, but if survivalism is a curse, as a woman no less, then I think I would rather live with such a curse than submit to heavenly forces beyond my control. Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.\nEboshi's struggle as a woman in Japan's feudal period is beautifully depicted here. Much like the western medieval times, women were treated as objects or cattle, so Eboshi's rescue of the women from prostitution is a remarkable example of our desire to be more than who we are supposedly 'fated' to be, to alter our fate rather than \"rise to meet it\" as the oracle claims. That is the trademark of humanity, and Eboshi proudly displays it. For remember: \"There is nothing more human than the will to survive,\" or as Miyazaki admitted himself in this film, \"The thirst to possess heaven and earth is what makes us human.\"\nThe titular heroine is indeed a complex character I should perhaps talk about, a more believable version of Tarzan of Rice. It's admirable that Miyazaki didn't just settle for a cheap romance like so many did (Pocahontas in particular), and even put San on an equal footing with Ashitaka rather than a damsel in distress. Yes, she did require him to save her from a swine's corruption (metaphor?) near the end, but it's the both of them that manages to save the day at the same time, not one or the other. The feral child coming to terms with her human side isn't that remarkable, but the execution here is definitely commendable.\nOne tiny problem stops this movie from being excellent, the classic villain that's the enemy of the forest, Jiko himself. I wish Miyazaki had just stick to what he does best, depicting characters as realistic people. Worst of all, Jiko is as ugly on the outside as he is on the inside, the trademark (and disgusting) stereotyping of ugly people I'm tired of.\nAside from that small flaw, Mononoke is beautifully-crafted, but that should come as no surprise by now in the long line of Miyazaki movies. If anything, I would prefer a more different art style than the same one every movie. The background score is relaxing, but having little appreciation for this genre of music, I couldn't really tell it apart from the music of other high fantasy movies, so I'm afraid it's just as remarkable to me as the animation.\n        "},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    My dear readers, please try to see this review with eyes unclouded by hate.\nPrincess Mononoke is another film of the famous Studio Ghibli, which is the studio partially responsible for changing the way we see today's animated films, and in my humble opinion, it's magnum opus.\nStory :  7 / 10  \"Good\"\nThe story takes place in Japan's Muromachi Period (15th century) and it portraits the state of constant changes of the relationship between man and nature. The prince of the people called Emishi, Ashitaka, takes part in a fight against a demon boar-like god and manages to defeat him, but he does not prevail\n          \n        unscathed. A deadly curse is implanted upon him by the demon - god, forcing him to search at his origins for a method to lift the curse. Thus, he embarks on a journey to the West, looking for answers, not knowing the perils he would face and the complicated situations he would get in : a war of epic proportions between man and forest gods of the west, and also between man and a autocratic ruler hell-bent on domination and imperialism. That's exactly when the main plot unfolds, giving a mature take on man's thirst for war and domination, and mainly focuses on man's hatred on everything which seems to be an obstacle on achieving his purpose (the purpose justify the means).\nArt :  9 / 10  \"Great\"\nAlong with the masterful plot, the gorgeous animation does work wonders for this film, making it enchanting. From the fluid animation in the intense action scenes, to the awe-inspiring portraying of forests and landscapes and the intimidating presence of forest gods, the animation delivers the maximum possible result. Additionally, the character's facial expressions are superbly animated, resulting in a very realistic depiction of a person's emotional struggle.  It manages to reach new heights on representing the essence of a quality story, and the animators deserve the utmost respect for achieving this feat.\nSound :  7 / 10  \"Good\"\nThe voice acting, from  brave Ashitaka to proud San is great. All the characters of the movie feel real and alive when they are talking, and they are all emotionally - charged as a result of great depiction of a real human. Joe Hisashi's music on Princess Mononoke is inspiring and appropriate to every single scene, managing to be strong and simultaneously not overwhelming the scene's content. Varying from gentle when Ashitaka speaks with San, to intimidating when a forest god appears and epic when Ashitaka rides on his red elk crossing huge forests and green landscapes, the music contributes into setting the right mood properly for every scene.\nCharacters :  7 / 10  \"Good\"\nThe big cast of characters, considering the big variation and believability of the different type of characters, adds an extra layer on the complexity and maturity of this film. Focusing on the main characters and the secondary ones who stand out, we have three dimensional and believable individuals, free from the norm of \"good or evil character\". They all have purposes which must be fulfilled, even if sacrifices are sure to be made, and they differ on sorting out of their priorities. Ashitaka is a brave warrior with a noble heart, who desires peace among gods and man. However, he is initially forced to become a hero, because he wants to lift the curse and save his own life. San is a human protected by the gods and living with them in the forest, because her parents left her behind when were frightened by the presence of the gods. Her disgust and anger against human is justified and profane, but in the end a human cannot forget his real nature, and thus she partially sides with the humans to face the crisis together. Lady Eboshi, who rules the iron-making settlement of Tatara Ba, is a warlike individual who wants to exterminate the gods from the forests, but for a reason : she wants to re-assure the safety of her people, who seem to be a bunch of outcasts that she sympathizes with. She's afraid of the God's total power over the human race and decides to act this way. Kudos to Hayao Miyazaki for not using the common and simplified archetypes of good and bad people, because there are no such a thing in existence.\nEnjoyment :  9 / 10  \"Great\"\nI fully enjoyed every minute of this epic saga that lit a fire inside me about how we humans treat our second mother Earth and it's nature, in the name of domination and money.\nVerdict :  7.4 / 10   \"Good\"\nThe best out of Miyazaki's films, showing a magnetic appeal that no one on this planet can deny. Dark, mature, thought-provoking and intense through all it's duration, never compromised with giving a simplistic answer to a complex matter, Princess Mononoke is not just another movie. It is a life experience.\nGive yourself a present today. Instantly watch Princess Mononoke, and be amazed of the food of thoughts and visual experience it will provide you with."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    The best part of Ghibli films is honestly rewatching them. Doing a dry run and seeing just everything that happens and taking in the artistic story and the pleasant but thought provoking plot is the first step. But taking a deeper look and tearing at the frays of deeper themes the second time around. While this is important to fully take in all the information a film like this throws at you, watching it is still fun anyways, and the rewatch helped me also enjoy the film as simply a modern creation in the style of telling an epic cultural myth. Princess Mononoke got bumped\n          \n        up from an 8 to a 9 for me after watching it twice, as it's richer in symbolic content than many of the other films from Mr. Miyazaki. And even if this theme along with some of his other consistencies gets a little repetitive and heavy handed in the expanse of his movies, it makes sense to apply it to a story similar to the creation and moral stories which are the basis for many cultures' moral standings and beliefs. \nThe story, to start is the exact reason that I go back to my library and dust off older movies, it's quite original and uses thematic ideas to tell  the full story and bring light to issues surriounding being human; and in this case Princess Mononoke is a beautiful case of fantasy reaching out to touch that reality. The film feels like an epic myth rooted in any number of cultures, but throws some magical realism into the setting of a growing industrialized world. The film's strongest point is how well it portrays and explores man's tense relationship of self progression versus the destruction that can cause on nature. The theme that nature is cyclical, a highly Native American trope, is important to the film as well, as the demons growing from the iron bullet comes around to affect Ashitaka at the beginning of the film. This is one of many things I picked up from the rewatch; themes and elements that are explored later in the film that aren't made explicit in the beginning when the viewer is being introduced the world of the film. The message, as is the case with several other Miyazaki movies, is relevant and beautiful but there's the occasional slip up of a line that comes across as too preachy or cheesy. In the case of this film it's any line where 'no hate will save the day'.  But even if that's the case, it makes sense in the vein of creating a story about the beginnings of man.\nThe art and sound, even being made in 1999 could easily hold up to the animation quality of a more modern film like The Wind Rises, and even while being 15 years older than that film succeeds just as well in the beautiful epic scope of the art and sound direction of the film. The film's music does the most for the aesthetic aspects of the scenes, particularly anytime there is a mass traveling scene of soaking in the landscape or quiet moments of tinging percussion whenever we see ripples in water or a quiet moment with otherworldly beings. The creatures of the world show the complex imagination of Myazaki and capture the life of the film the best, there's so much detail to show who the animal characters are, in addition to just how well the animation works for both the animals and humans. When they make them talk with a simple mouth motion it's odd but other than that there's a constant sense of adventure from most every movement. Both good and bad creatures in the film add a lot in their own ways too, ranging from elegant to disturbing and destructive. The people in the film all have more elaborate costumes that enhance the fantasy setting, but the director's art suffers because so many studio Ghibli people look absolutely identical, and so many of Miyazaki's protagonists unfortunately blend together due to this weakness. It's a small gripe, but spans all of his films enough to be not only a bore, but a consistent one. Everything is definitely beautiful in the art department, it's just that Mononoke doesn't go above and beyond in character aesthetics other than the bright contrasting costumes.\nWhile not 100% interesting, the characters are simple enough to work in the context of the classic story idea (hero, villain, mystic gods etc.). But even if Ashitaka seems like the most typical and boring of hero characters, his demon arm provides more depth to his character. While noble, the flaw of being infected with the demon cuts away the naivety characters like him have and gives him introspection for peaceful answers to tense situations, in addition to the fact that he uses this to make a goal unique to either side fighting the other in the story. While they work well in the way that they’re simple, many of the other characters however are different from him as their character traits are defined solely by who they side with. I wish there were more little moments of introspection from the individuals who are pulling the strings, such as when San saves Ashitaka after trying to kill him. The weakest part of the Ghibli films I’ve seen is the romance. Characters will announce that they love each other even if they have little to no time to build chemistry or attract during the down time between action scenes. And while I prefer internal dialogue and introspection over outright saying it, the other characters during the film show that they have noble reasons for helping out their side and tear at the frays of their own flawed ideologies. Lady Eboshi while straight faced and cold still cares for the lepers, and the emperor’s troops show up only for Iron Town residents to start defending the wolves. But even without little bits of fleshed out dialogues, the climax resolves fighting and changes minds of characters on both sides. A guilty pleasure of mine is a happy ending or a horrible one done right, but this one is an example of everything turning out okay in the end and finding the balance between progress and nature.\nIt falls short of being a masterpiece, but Princess Mononoke is an oasis among so many bad movies these days. Despite its flaws I can’t help but say I’d recommend it to anyone looking for a movie immersive and beautiful in its aesthetics while maintaining an occasionally tragic yet hopeful story at the same time."},

After killing the Boar God, Ashitaka discovers that the demon was under a curse and that he in-turn was cursed by coming into contact with the God. The curse will eventually kill him and in order to find a cure Ashitaka is forced to travel west to where Nago had originally come from, with a lump of metal as his only clue.

Caught in in the middle of this raging war he learns that both sides fight for good reasons. The humans want to thrive and grow and the forest spirits want to survive.\n~ Art ~\nMononoke hime artwork is simply stunning. All the characters' faces really suited their characteristics and personalities because all the characters had their own individual face shapes, eyes, noses, mouths, hair and bodies which appear almost realistic unlike other animes which have pretty much the same character but with different hair colour and stuff. I think that the most beautiful art was the scenery in which it showed the forest with all its vibrance and life which also made it very realistic and makes us appreciate the beauty of the natural environment where we can also share the love the Mononoke has for the forest. Overall, i really loved the artwork in Princess Mononoke because of its style, colours and the design.\n~ Sound ~\nThe music was one of the best part of this movie, they really fitted well with the theme and the concept of the story. The music was really expressive and emotional and contributes a lot to the film because it makes the audience feel what the character is feeling and makes it possible for us to empathise with the character. I think that the music was very Japanese and classical and fitted perfectly with each of the scenes in the film.\nOverall this movie is realy great, one of miyazaki best movie. I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in animations, a good story or an emotional plot.\n        "},

I admit that I actually did enjoy Mononoke Hime quite a bit however.....there's one thing about it all that really bugs me. Why is it called Mononoke Hime? \nOk I get it the front cover is the girl and a wolf...but what was the story actually about...a little boy...so why Mononoke Hime? This is MY Opinion but the title of the film ruined what I really expected.\n          \n        I thought at first it would be about this amazing girl that looks like she could be raised by wolves or lives with wolves but thats only part of it, it's actually based around this little boy and the girl is rarely in the scenes!! (MY opinion) \nApart from the movie being names such a non-sense name, I personally liked part of the movie. I felt like the Art was beautiful and it really came out in certain scenes, the way the 'Gods' where shown was very lively and vivid in the art and this made them stand out and shine (Literally). The sound is also my favourite in the movie, it made the scenes come to life and make you enjoy watching that clip of the movie, it gives you that real feeling of adventure. You knew when you music changed something would happen...good or bad?...you didn't know, but the music was just lovely. \nThe characters (apart from the fact it's not actually based on the girl) was still generally well developed. This boy that goes off and finds himself in a town of development. This kid is well developed as well the story develops further he develops more and starts to understand more of himself and others. There is also a lot more character development within some people in the movie and these developments you can see are slowly advancing, even changing who the person is. Mononoke Hime was one of the best developments in the film, as she keeps to only herself but develops further by the end of the movie. \nOverall this film I did actually enjoy but still hate the fact that I was mislead from the title thinking it would be about the girl rather than a boy. Some scenes was really well done and stuck out from the movie as the pace changed and developed and some scenes was so nice and calming you had a feel for what was happening. \nI would recommend this to anyone that likes a war-like old story based feeling with gods in it. It was well produced and the music is lovely, just don't expect to see a lot of Mononoke Hime. \n~ Canaan\n        "},

Princess Mononoke is probably the darkest one of his films, which as I think makes it that compelling at some point. The great and detailed style of drawing drew me in once again. Just like the great soundtrack, the good pacing and great story telling did.\nBut there is always one little thing that annoys me: why do especially the main characters in your movies have to look pretty much the same? Why Hayao Miyazaki?\n(I know that he is probably doing that on purpose to increase the recognition value of his films, but still I'd fall more in love with\n          \n        more individual looking characters.)\nLeaving that aside Princess Mononoke is a great piece of art. Since I grew up in a western culture, I don't now that much of japanese folklore by heart. However the way this story was told and animated it was able to evoke the feeling that the idea of kami in the woods shaped like gigantic wolves or boars e.g. was nothing unusual. Watching this movie you get really drawn to this mystic and beautiful world and I for one really rooted for the spirits to win against the humans.\nAnother part of this film that makes it great is that there is not an absolute black and white way of telling this story. The film tries to get you to view the characters stories \"with eyes unclouded\". However it is pretty obvious that the kami and other residents of the forest are the characters shown in a more sympathetic way. Thats because the film wants to get its watchers to think more critically about what we humans do to our environment. And I think it really DOES get you thinking. Which is not only own to the course of the story but also the way the environments are drawn. (pay attention to it when you watch it, if you haven't all along)\nAt the end I have to point out one thing that bugged me a little. Actually this refers rather to another one of his movies: Spirited away. There are really obvious soundtrack similarities, some melodies even sounding pretty much the same. But since Spirited away came out a few years later than Princess Mononoke I don't mean to critizise this movie. It's more or less the same as I stated with the looks of the characters. So, just saying. \nOverall it's a great movie. So, watch it! :)\n        "},

This film for me is the first one I talk about it when people ask me \"What films have inspired you?\" This film practically forced me to take an interest in the frighteningly beautiful area that is anime. Although to this day, nothing has instilled so many emotions in me.\nWhat Miyazaki did with Princess Mononoke was create a world, which nowadays is in my mind taken for grated especially with computer generated effects\n          \n        being able to make whatever the director really desires. Mononoke is different then all those surreal Avatar-esque productions because in my mind it really taps into something that is underlyingly real. \nIt is a story of humans pitted against gods and spirits, set in a lavish, beguiling landscape. Disney it isn't... Miyazake's work has a luminous, transcendent quality with a consistent gift for the visually memorable. There are moments in this film when you completely forget it is animated, the visual quality is that good.\nAs I said, be aware of the fact this is all NOT Disney. The first time we meet San (or 'Mononoke') she is holding a dagger, and her mouth is framed by blood after attempting to suck the poison from her wounded wolf mother's chest. This isn't Cinderella, this is a mighty powerful image Disney would never attempt.\nEither its the well established characters such as the melancholy warrior prince Ashitaka who seeks to end a war or the wild wolf princess San who hates her own people, or the beautiful visual bliss that is the feudal Japanese countryside and it's forests. All just accumulate and build into a dense story about war, the environment, greed and love. \nIf you have never come across the work of Hayao Miyazaki you are in for\na wonderful surprise. The Japanese anime director and writer has earned\nglobal fame for his extraordinary work - 'Spirited Away' won\nan oscar - and Princess Mononoke bears all the hallmark style of this\ngreat creator. Its a movie that will definitely stick in my mind as one filled with incredible gusto as something that started as just pen and paper.\n        "},

Back then, man and beast lived in harmony, but as time went by most of the great forests were destroyed. Those that remained were guided by gigantic beasts who owed their allegiance to the great Forest Spirit, for those were the days of gods and demons. Princess Mononoke follows Prince Ashitaka and his red elk Yakul as they journey in search of a way to relieve Ashitaka of the curse of the demon boar god. In seeking out the reason for the demons existence and\n          \n        a way to live on, Ashitaka will come face-to-face with the battle raging between mankind and the forest.\nLittle needs to be added by me as evidence to Princess Mononoke's greatness. Until the release of Titanic, Mononoke was the highest grossing film in Japan; the entire film (save some 10 minutes) is hand-drawn, and at the time of its release it was the most expensive anime ever produced, costing some $20 million. All of this suggests that it would be foolish to not give the film a view, but I will add my two cents as well. Mononoke's animation is quite easily the best I have ever seen - you will be able to tell that nearly the entire thing is hand-drawn, especially when you see the amount of detail given to the forest scenes which appear frequently throughout.\nThe soundtrack is beautifully produced, fitting perfectly with the film's mood, while the English cast includes notable actors such as Billy Bob Thorton, Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, and Jada Pinkett Smith. Most importantly, the story is wonderful and well-paced: even at 2 hours, the length felt appropriate and there was never a dull moment. The world in which the story is set is beautiful and represents well the historic Muromachi period in Japan. Characters are well developed and Ashitaka's stance as mediator between the forest and mankind leaves viewers with a timeless environmental lesson. I could easily go on praising the merits of this film, but you should stop wasting time reading a review and go watch it now.\nOverall Score: A+\nCheck out snapshots and downloadable movie/OST at my blog, http://animefiend.blogspot.com\n        "},

Even for those who dislike Ghibli in general, this is one unmissable anime for all ages to enjoy. \nThe story and its characters can easily seem simplistic on the surface; a young man travels looking for a cure and gets caught up in something bigger than he'd expected. While this may be true in some respects, Mononoke Hime's presentation of it is truly exceptional. In comparison to other Ghibli films, Mononoke Hime has a darker, tone with more gravity to the situation at hand. The concept of the personification\n          \n        of nature is compelling, and it is particularly the presentation of the spirits of the forest that allows Mononoke Hime to rise above all other Ghibli films. While Ashitaka may not be the most developed character ever, as is often the case with the protagonists of Ghibli films, his relationship with San and Eboshi is more realistic and dynamic than other films, particularly considering the limited time frame of the film rather than a series. \nMononoke Hime's engraving into the history of anime and animation as a whole, both as an epic and a classic, is mainly due to the unparalleled, outstanding art. The use of colour is perfectly used, blended and animated, with animation well ahead of most other anime of the time (a perhaps niche example is Flame of Recca, the art of which was incredibly poor when compared to Mononoke Hime). If there was any negative to the art, it would be that it was too good-it could be seen as distracting from the focus on the story. As ever with Studio Ghibli, the sound was excellent throughout. There was never a moment in the film where I felt the music was out of place or too much. \nIn conclusion, Mononoke Hime is a true masterpiece even among the better Ghibli films. It is incredibly accessible for all kinds of people, young or old, fans of Ghibli or not, or even fans of anime or not. This epic has earnt itself a place in the Hall of Fame for anime all-time greats, and deservedly so. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on something amazing.\n        "},

He is a prince for the Emishi tribe. As I described earlier he is cursed early on and is set off on his adventure to break the curse. He is a very determined man who won’t stop until he gets what he wants. He is not afraid to back down when in times of danger, and is not afraid to kill any human who is in his way. Ashitaka is also a very curious and kind man who wants to learn as much as he can about the mysterious San. Over the course of the movie Ashitaka plays the link between humanity and nature and wants to stop at nothing to keep them from harming one another, “what I want is for the humans and forest to live in peace”.\nSan is an seventeen year old girl who is the so called “princess” of the series. Early on in her life she was abandoned by her birth parents and was left to die in the wilderness until a pack of wolves decided to raise her as if they were her own. At first in the series she is a fairly tough to show her true thoughts and ideology until slowly over time Ashitaka is able to crack her and reveal her true self to both himself and the audience. San is also a very strong and proud warrior who is not afraid of death, “I'm not afraid to die! I'd do anything to get you humans out of my forest!”.\nMy biggest problem with the characters of this movie is how they all seem to be very flat and are more or less just used more as a plot device instead of feeling like an actual person. Ashitaka feels like someone to whom I will forget about not even a month from now; San is someone to whom seems too flat of a character to even care for them. I’m sorry for sounding a bit negative, but the fact in which all of the characters have a huge lack of character feels like a huge problem when it comes to this movie.\n~Music 8/10~\nThe orchestral pieces in this movie are very well crafted and fit the mood of the movie very well. Some of the pieces may be elegant and simplistic, when others may be loud and bombastic, meanwhile some of them may be quiet and mysterious. With that being said I feel as if the soundtrack all melds together and is hard to differentiate each track from one another, that is my one major complaint with the selection of songs.\nIf you were to ask me which track from the OST was my favorite, my immediate response would be “Ashitaka and San”.\n~Art/Animation 9/10~\nBeing for a movie made back in the 90’s and is from an era where anime back then was still being hand drawn, I would have to applaud Studio Ghibli for making a beautiful piece of art that still holds up today. The artstyle is still retains the classic look that Ghibli is known for. \nI love seeing how every single blade of grass, piece of fur, leaf on a tree, and every single Kodama (little white spirit ghost) were all drawn individually by hand. I love how reflective the water is and how there are some very unique character models for certain people/animals. But the one major complaint that I have with every studio ghibli movie is how all of the human characters retain the same facial structure as one another, this is one of my major issues with ghibli movies is how they all look the same… none of them stick out from the rest.\nBut all and all, a great movie made by hand.\n~Final Thoughts~\nAs you could have guessed by the tone of the review, I personally did not enjoy this movie as much as most people might have. I took a moment after watching the movie and contemplated for a bit about how I realized how I have seen this movie before, and then I came to the realization in which I had watched a very similar telling of the movie before in the form of Pokemon 4Ever: Celebi - Voice of the Forest. I don’t know if it was because of that pokemon movie that made me not enjoy Princess Mononoke as much because I grew up with the movie, or if it just happened to be the case of me not feeling deeply invested with the characters.\nAll and all this was not my favorite Studio Ghibli movie ever. However Princess Mononoke is a good movie in terms of story telling and is one that I would recommend others to see but is not one that I would say is a “Must Watch”. I am going to be awarding this movie with an 7/10. It is one that should be watched but I would not say is high priority.\n~Similar Anime Recommendations~\nMushishi, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Parasyte, and Pokemon 4Ever… yeah I just went there."},

The setting and just how detailed each character is still amazes me until today.\nStory -10/10\nFrom the get-go, the conflict appears and it leads to the origin of the problem which is mankind's neglect of mother nature. The protagonist's journey to find the root cause of what befell his village leads him to come across the titular character, an interesting monk, entities from the magical forest and the antagonist who is really just a greedy businesswoman who has questionable-to-good-intentions.\nArt - 10/10\nThis film is famous for being\n          \n        the first Ghibli film to incorporate 3D rendering. Mononoke-hime features the Ghibli quality and attention to detail we have come to expect. Because one of this film's main themes is the environment, you can observe the lush foliage and richness of the forest contrasted to the bleak and grimy qualities of Iron Town. The art and animation just enmesh so cohesively well in this film. An unquestionable 10.\nSound - 10/10\nI've always been unsure how to grade sound but I'm just going to say that every sound effect that you are supposed to hear is well done in this film. This is based on the Japanese original dub which I highly  highly highly recommend is the one that you watch.\nCharacter -10/10\nAgain, Miyazaki does not designate a \"true villain\" in this film. There is no character that represents true evil with no remorse. The main antagonist here is human beings' greed and neglect of the environment. For me, the actual protagonist is Prince Ashitaka as he is seen even helping Mononoke with defending the forest. Lady Eboshi is an interesting sub-antagonist because she has a point in accepting the rejects of society and letting them work and have purpose where no one can judge them (her workers were courtesans and lepers if I remember correctly). How the characters realize how lethal it is to be ignorant of the state of mother nature by greedily taking and taking its resources merits a perfect score in the character category for me.\nEnjoyment - 10/10\nWith all that said, I enjoyed it immensely. It is without a doubt my favorite Studio Ghibli production.\nThis film is an incredible achievement in Japanese animation with its highly detailed animation, engrossing narrative and memorable characters. It is a required viewing for any anime fan. Enjoy.\n        "},

An epic tale of the clash between men and gods, of the love between those intertwined by fate, of man's drive to do both good and evil, Princess Mononoke is just one of those films. I cannot stress how much this movie moves me. This is, of course, in large thanks to Joe Hisaishi's masterful score, but Miyazaki proves again he has an unrivaled touch in painting a lush world of not only magic and beauty, but rot and decay. Above all else, however, is his undying faith in the goodness of\n          \n        men, that though we may lose our way more often than we find it, at our core we seek to do what is best for those we love. I don't really want to write much about this movie, because going in blind IMO is the best way to experience the majesty within. Know this: Princess Mononoke is as good a film as you're ever going to see. It is epic, it is beautiful, it is sad, it is horrifying, and it is above all incredibly cathartic.

His exceptional directing and good films are known worldwide. s an anime fan, I heard lots of good things about Miyazaki and I just had to watch one of his works sooner or later.  I chose Princess Mononoke--a high fantasy film made at the brink of cel animation era. Since I am a huge fan of cel animation I expected a good film but what I got was something way, way better than a \"good film\". Needless to say, I was amazed. \nPrincess Mononoke tells a\n          \n        story about Ashitaka and his journey to the west. Thanks to his quest of finding a cure for his disease, he is thrown into the conflict between humans and forest gods. But don't be fooled by the premise, it's not a simple story but a complex tale about humanity and nature trying to live in balance and harmony in the upcoming era of industrialization. \nThis conflict isn't about good guys against bad guys with a gifted hero saving the life of a beautiful girl. What makes this film so good is how two sides of the conflict are kept in a gray morality. There is no clear villain or hero--even Eboshi who acts antagonistically has a genuine motive for her actions and the forest wasn't completely right to wipe out everything. Humans greedily wanted the resources from the forest in order to progress faster and win the war while the forest wanted preservation and didn't want humans to destroy their home. Two sides, presented with logical arguments and genuine motives, in a way act like a parallel to each other.  They both want to live but never actually tried to live together. This is where our protagonist comes into play. Ashitaka is the one who tries to reconcile two sides, who tries to restore the balance. He respects Eboshi and her desire to protect the village and people but he also respects San, the wild wolf-princess, who wants to protect her tribe and nature. While this theme of humanity vs nature isn't a very groundbreaking one, the question posed about living in harmony is relevant to this day. Industrialization vs environment is something we struggle with all the time.\nThe finale of the film is what really sets the themes in stone and while it indeed acts as a conclusion, it's also an open ending in a way. The characters got a new chance to try and live together and their real story is just about to begin. It's an ending yet we still care about the characters and cheer for them. A rather uplifting finale.\nPrincess Mononoke indeed shines in its themes but I can't forget about imagery. I'm not a big fan of fantasy but the gorgeous art, very detailed animation, tasteful use of CG, and soundtrack really absorbed me into the world. First few minutes created an appropriate atmosphere and cued me in just perfectly. The world is really inviting and warm even when the mood and tone of the story are rather serious and mature. Beautiful backgrounds and completely hand-drawn animation are a joy to look at and it proves that Miyazaki's craftsmanship is on another level.\nThe exceptionally written characters, aforementioned themes, and gorgeous art style work together in harmony to create an exceptional film. I am now convinced that Miyazaki is an excellent director and this film's great success is very well-deserved. 9/10"},

Here is my review (warning: this review might be extremely biased but nevertheless if you want to know what the big fuss is about or why I loved this movie so much here's why. (or you could simply scroll to my overall if you think the whole review is too long)(sorry for all these confusing parenthesis)):\n-story: This movie is often referred to as an environmentalist movie, and it truly is all right but not in the way you'd expect. This is not a tree huger\n          \n        movie or one that bluntly states this topic. This story truly has an amazing storytelling all of it's own and it doesn't transmit a message of man vs nature, it's a message that seeks man and nature to cooperate.\n-art: The Ghibli studios blew my mind away with the art in this story. It is amazingly detailed: you can see the individual grass blades painted in, along with the textures of the rocks and the dimensions to the foliage just by seeing it it's evident a lot of thought and work was put into the movie.\n-sound: I enjoyed the soundtrack from before watching the movie and it's worthwhile checking out if you're into soundtracks (and soft balladic music). There's a great blending of the soundtracks in the story that add a whole new level of depth to some scenes of the story. \n-character: Great character development. Each main character has it's own personality well-defined and without seeming stereotypical. Something I also find very interesting is that the village in the story is controlled by women as opposed to the usual men-controlled villages. There are also some interesting twists in character roles.\n-enjoyment: Is this part even necessary? It's obvious that I loved the movie!!\n-overall: I truly consider this a masterpiece. I was extremely impressed. Before watching the movie I thought that it was probably overrated and wasn't expecting that much until I actually saw it. I truly do recommend this movie, I don't think it'd disappoint you.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    This is a spoiler-free review of Miyazaki Hayao's animated movie Mononoke Hime. I'll try to review this movie as professionally as I can with as much objectivity as possible.\nFirst of all, I'd like to say that this is my first review on Myanimelist so bear with me when it comes to the overall length and lack of depth as I have decided to leave out a summary and as many spoilers as possible.\n\nPrincess Mononoke, or Mononoke Hime as it is known in Japanese, is the sixth of famous Hayao-Miyazaki-directed Studio Ghibli movies and also the first that is animated using CGI. \nStory:\nIn terms of plot,\n          \n        Princess Mononoke is one of Miyazaki's strongest hits. The movie changes locations a lot and builds up a lot of tension and excitement for the viewer as the movie is gearing up for the big confrontation at the end of the movie. As this is also the first Miyazaki movie that's longer than 90 minutes, it gets enough time to build up and have a very satisfying finale without suffering from pacing issues. \nArt:\nLike any other Studio Ghibli movie, the art and animation is absolutely astonishing. It is highly recommended that if you decide to watch this movie that you get to watch it in 1080p or on blu-ray because every frame in this movie is so full of details that it would be very unfortunate to miss out on that, like when Ashitaka is trying to traverse a river, he ties his clothes to his bow and between Yakul's horns to prevent them from getting wet. In addition to that, this movie uses CGI to enhance some of its scenes and it works wonderfully. Instead of using CGI lazily to finish up the work quickly in a more cost-efficient manner, it's quite evident that the animators cared about every single frame they animated because this movie has some of the best CGI-animated scenes you can find. The CG simply blends into the handdrawn backgrounds so well without looking jarring at all. At last, it should be noted that this, unlike the other Studio Ghibli movies, is not a family friendly movie. Some scenes get very gritty and the movie does not hold back when it comes to showing blood or gore when it's appropriate. \nSound:\nThe voice acting is pretty solid and the voice actors were well-casted so no complaints here. And like every other Miyazaki directed movie, the score is incredible. Composed by Hisaishi Joe, some of the tracks are downright exhilarating, fitting into their respective scenes pretty well. \nCharacters:\nDespite being the protagonist, Ashitaka is a relatively boring character who does not receive much development. He simply plays the role of the hero character and has by default always set his mind to be the hero. This means that he always makes the right decisions without thinking, as if he's just fulfilling his role as that type of character. Other than him, San, the wolf-princess and the mascot of this movie, has surprisingly little screentime and seems a bit downplayed in a way. She is without a doubt a very interesting character but the movie seems to lack some quiet moments where the viewer gets to learn more about how she is as a character. With that said, the characters in this movie do serve their purpose in this kind the story quite well. Despite the lack of development, these characters are still very likeable and interesting to watch. At last, I'd like to note that their character designs are really good and stand out in a positive way, especially San, for having this wild but still graceful look to her. \nEnjoyment:\nAh, how Miyazaki never seizes to impress me. Princess Mononoke is an absolute gem and despite the hype that has been around this movie for the last decade, it's not difficult to understand why it's appreciated by so many people. Although the characters may come of a little bit disappointing due to their lack of development and San's lack of screen-time, they are still quite likeable and the story itself is more than enough to compensate for the few flaws the characters have. Furthermore, the animation is absolutely gorgeous and could even be considered a milestone for many aspiring animators and studios when it comes to making believable and convincing movement and blending 2D and 3D animation together.\nOverall rating: 09/10 and highly recommended.

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    • My grasp on why people consider Mononoke Hime great.\nIt is another Miyazaki masterpiece that showcases beautiful landscapes and the theme of preserving and protecting nature from of the oh so evil humanity, and how it will also pushback when it is demanded of it. It is one visually stunning tale which manages to capture visually the importance and beauty of our surroundings, as well as the ferocity and primality of nature. Striving to find the balance between us and nature is something we should seek for the benefit of every living being on the planet, so this also makes Mononoke Hime really forward thinking.\n          \n        The dedication to visual details, as well as its theme and the fact that it doesn't really pursue a moral echelon where the conflict revolves amongst the forces of good and evil, but rather on industry and nature, is what make this movie great, and worthwhile to watch.\n• What I think of Mononoke Hime\nMononoke Hime made me cement in my values that I should always be skeptical of the praise something that gets critical acclaim from anyone. Not because the praise for the things it is praised for are a mute point, but because I might not hold these aspects at the same value as other people. Whenever I hear someone praising a Ghibli movie, I always hear that this made me >feel< in a certain positive way through its well directed visuals, but I usually hardly ever hear the thoughts on the story itself, the writing of the characters, general theme representation. It is usually a blend of three things, which are: how the person felt, how it will make me feel or simply how it should make me feel. The problem with how I should feel or how I will feel or how you felt, is that this is going to be my experience and I hold different values to you, as well as have my own feelings that are influenced by my own experience and thoughts. So rather I prefer to talk about what I thought, what you might think and what you might value when approaching the movie, because your experience simply won't be the same as mine, and you can reach a conclusion yourself  based on the information you're given.\nFirst of all, the reason most Ghibli movies are praised in this fashion is due to a huge merit that they completely deserve to be given. They pay a lot of attention to the details they put into the animation, to facial expressions, to realistical movements, to well executed SFX to match the visuals and so on and so forth. Due to this, Ghibli movies are undoubtfully gonna find some willing participant who is gonna love them. Because they have really well detailed visuals which will make you experience things visually no other movie will make you experience. The Ghibli studio have honed the visual department to such a huge degree, that I consider everything else past the presentation to often be really subpar or mediocre, simply because it focuses on every single visual detail it presents a little too much.\nFor instance, in this movie, the theme of the story is the presentation of industrialism against nature, but it starts by focusing on a character that doesn't really have any role in the story, besides being around. He doesn't really have any personal benefit from any events in the plot and he merely is an explorer, who was cursed by a boar upon the death of said boar. He then flees his village to find a cure. None of this really ties in with the goals of either faction of the movie, the animals and the industrial village. But unfortunately, he is the protagonist of this movie. I am serious when I say that this character truly did not have a purpose besides being around. He is not involved in the main conflict in a personal manner that would affect his life, or has any direct effect outside of making the outcome happen about 15 minutes faster. He doesn't really have a personality, and he is mostly presented as a stoic jesus protagonist that is capable of doing anything. The character has no flaws, no sides he is really on, and the movie isn't really truly about him. He is simply pointless, but he is dragged around everywhere, despite the fact that the movie might be simply be told better without the existence of this character, simply because the character itself doesn't really enrich the story's theme and progression in any way, and the characters would be the exact same way despite his interactions with them. He truly has no role or influence over anything. A good chunk of the start focuses on him getting the curse and him going on the journey, before introducing the actual elements that will actually matter. \nBut how did I find the theme executed outside of this character? Somewhat shallowly, because it relies on your preconceived notion of nature and industry, and your awareness of the fact that we are hurting nature by simply having technology. I don't find that either side is strongly displayed. One side, the human industrial village, simply seem to want to improve their technological advances throughout the movie and be dominant, but there isn't really any strong motivating factors to drive them to do that, other than greed. But greed doesn't simply come out of nowhere, and the message of \"nature should be preserved\" comes across as \"eating your own shit is bad\" in terms of how eloquent is portrayed. Because, yes, everybody has ambition and ambition can be detrimental to your surroundings. But understanding the ambition itself would give far more depth to the character and it wouldn't make the humans feel as onedimensional and antagonistical to the nature, simply due to the fact that they exist. Their leader simply wants power for the sake of it, and that simply makes them seem shallow and far too simple of a character.\nAnd the other side that is relevant is nature itself, which are the animals. The animals rely even more on our preconceived notions and knowledge, and are mostly portrayed as territorial. Their existence is threatened by humans and the movie then uses the nature to create one big metaphor about us exploiting the habitat we live in for shallow benefits. But it doesn't really seem to be understanding enough to get that animals, just like humans, with humans also being animals, seek the most efficient way to get the comfort and resources that will make them live the most prosperous life they could. Just like them, we are territorial, and want to prosper. What makes us different is that we are capable of understanding how our actions impacts everyone else. The movie doesn't really appear to our rationality, and simply boils down to conclude that, hurting nature is bad, because we are selfish. It doesn't really try to understand the root of the selfishness, which is a very animalistic need of being better.\nThe movie pretty much makes the argument that we are greedy, and we should stop, because nature will push back, and we will feel sorry we were ambitious. It pretty much goes full 5 year old and presents people who just want to use nature for their own ambitions without concern for others while fueled by greed. It doesn't really display any more complex motivations past I want this so I am gonna get it. So it simply sways in the direction of its argument simply by making a lot of metaphors and presenting you an argument you probably have plenty of reasons personally to back up. But it doesn't really build on it and merely presents it, and used that as a basis of creating visuals on the screen. This is the way most Ghibli movies are presented, with them usually picking an idea and developing interesting visuals without really wrapping everything neatly or presenting a story, which makes me dislike them. It might work on children, but Ghibli movies simply don't carry themselves in a way that I would deem thoughtful, because it doesn't try to create depth between what it wants to present. Mononoke Hime, just like every other Ghibli movie, shows you things, amongst which it is centered around.\nBut what I can appreciate about this movie comparative to the others is that it at least has an argument. The actions in it aren't pointless and the characters to have their own personal goals to which we can relate. They're not meant to be fairy tale like to which were you should marvel at, and their actions can be understood, despite the fact it is a really superficial understanding and presentation. And well, the fact that I agree with it helps. Yes, human ambition will hurt their environment and therefore them afterwards. But the movie is too expressive of its own ideals and too dismissive of the ideals that drive the people it would deem antagonistical forward. I could see a clear divide on how the humans are treat for their ambition in terms of their thinking and logic, and how the animals and the forest is seen as, despite there being clear parallels to be drawn between the animals being territorial and seeking more territory and benefits, just like the humans.  \nUltimately, while I've enjoyed the message of the movie due to reasons unrelated to the movie, and the way it looked visually, I cannot consider it a truly good movie, due to how onedimensionally it portrayed everything and how it sometimes presented details irrelevant to its theme. I still deem it guilty of relying too much on feeling and too little on portraying a sound narrative, but I did see the barebones of a narrative in this movie, and there's more thought to be put behind any character's action, than any other Ghibli movie I have had watched.\n• Who I would recommend Mononoke Hime to and who I would tell to avoid the series.\nWhat I've personally enjoyed it for is the classic Ghibli eye for detail put in each frame of the animation, and the fact that I could at least appreciate the fact that I felt that Mononoke Hime is the Ghibli movie that I actually think isn't formulaic and actually tries to be different from other movies produced by the studio. In the situation that I had to recommend this to someone that has never seen a Ghibli movie, I'd recommend this because it felt the most ambitious and it actually had the most to say, rather than seem like its purpose was to entertain and marvel children. It is still in the same vein, without putting much thought in the motivations of the characters and how they think, but rather dragging them in a direction, but it does display a message that gets very little presentation.\nSo it depends if you're looking for a simple movie, that conveys the message that mankind should preserve nature, and leave aside their ambition or not. If you are, Mononoke Hime gets the job done. But note that I didn't really particularly find it thoughtful in the execution of what it tried to carry through, so if you don't mind its ideas simply being presented, you probably won't have a problem with how the events of the story are presented. At heart it is a very nice looking movie, that is also just as simple.\n        "},

Princess Mononoke (or Mononoke-Hime, as in the original Japanese) was my tenth Ghibli film to watch. After I finished it, I took some time to ponder the worth of my own life and then rewatched it! It was amazing. It was a masterpiece. However, even a masterpiece as some flaws. \nThe movie took me to another world in a way that few other films have ever done, and wields many powerful messages. What the film has to say is worth hearing, and there are moments that are very moving. The\n          \n        story is a good one, with many different settings, ideas, and some wonderful moments of pure beauty. But it sometimes takes itself a little too seriously, with excessive violence and preachy speeches. However, because of the wonderful presentation, it almost earns these elements.\nAt this point in my life, I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do when I grew up. I had though about being an animst (my word for animators who only do anime), but after seeing this movie, and the video on youtube about how it was made, it started to seem like a whole lot of work lol. So anyway, here's my review. \nStory: 8\nThe story itself is a bit on the cliche side: the protagonist, Prince Ashitaka is trying to protect his village from a demon, and, as he fights it off, it touches him and leaves a cursed mark. So Ashitaka, the last Prince, is banished from his village and sets out \"to see with eyes unclouded by hate.\" A metal ball was found inside the demon's body and Ashitaka believes this is what turned the boar into a demon in the first place. His journey is about finding where the ball came from. Along the way, he meets Princess Mononoke, a girl who was raised by wolves and hates humans. His journey leads him to Irontown, where a monk with a name of which I've forgotten demands that Lady Eboshi (the queen figure or whatever) get him the head of the Forest Spirit. So, although Ashitaka and San try to protect it, Eboshi ends up shooting off his head. As a result, the spirit's body ends up turning into a deadly black goo and searching for its head. Ashitaka and San then try to return his head.\nI hope that wasn't too confusing. I'm giving the story an 8 because its not unique and its not really the story that draws us into this anime. The story's good - just not the main draw. \nArt: 10\nThe art of Princess Mononoke is AMAZING. The animation is practically flawless. The detail and movement is better than in any other animation I’ve seen.  Princess Mononoke is easily Miyazaki's best artwork. \nSound: 10\nThe OST of Mononoke-Hime is just outstanding and is some of the most beautiful I’ve ever heard. I LOOOVE the sound. \nAlso, the voices (even in the dub) I believe are outstanding. Joe Hisaishi does the music for most Miyazaki films and his score for Princess Mononoke is easily one of his best. \nCharacter: 7\nWhenever I watch a Miyazaki film I always get those 3D characters. However, in Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki's focus is too wholly on the themes of his story rather than the characters, which ultimately weakens the entire movie until it requires a certain suspension of belief. It usually obtains this from its audience though, simply because of its high quality in every other way. But it is my belief that if you want to tell a story about humanity or the world as a whole, you must make it about individuals.\nAshitaka himself is a very admirable character, who wishes to bring peace between the forest and the town, but there is very little opportunity to really understand his character and motivations. \nIn fact, the secondary characters are much more complex than the main ones.\nSan, the titular character, a girl who was raised by a wolf, is only ever actually shown as an extremely angry and bitter individual who sides with the forest rather than her own kind. Any depth and complexity of her character is spoken of by other characters but never actually shown in her own actions or words. The attention of the audience is always being drawn to the supposed tragedy of her situation, but this is never fully explained. I do not see any true confliction within her. She seems entirely convinced that she is doing the right thing. This wouldn’t be a problem at all except for the movie’s incessant focus on it.\nEnjoyment: 9\nThis is one of my favorite Ghibli movies and I highly reccomend it. I'm not rating it a 10 because of its flaws, but it is a must-watch for any anime fan. It is well-worth watching, perhaps even more than once. But the atmosphere, presentation, and fascinating plot can’t quite make up for the distant characters. \nOverall: 9\nIf you haven't seen it. See it. I've seen it at least 10 times to date. Possibly more. I enjoy it every single time. And by the way, Ashitaka was one of my first anime crushes :)\n        "},

You have a feeling after watching, with huge eyes, how can someone create this. I have had this feeling rarely in the time that I've watched anime, but when it happens, it's truly inspiring.\nThis is a story about humans, and nature, as well as human nature, and it tells it oh so very well with the powerful scenes of the gods, and their interactions alone.\nThe story is something to be amazed by, I'm reminded of Inuyasha setting wises, absolutely not story wise, but that may just be nostalgia from watching both\n          \n        pictures when I was younger.\nLike any great movie, to be able to know and love the characters, to understand their motives and tell a powerful story all at the same time can be difficult to do. Miyazaki has done that in this film.\nI don't know if people say this show is for children, but I actually think it's targeted to young adults and up. One being the amount of blood in this film, as well a mature themes (Not sexual, though little is there).\nThe story has much to do with nature, and how humans treat and respect it.\nThe art is always something to be amazed by. The animation is top notch as usual. This studio is truly something special, the perfect people have grouped together to create Studio Gibli, and create these amazing films, it's just beautiful.\nJoe Hisaishi is amazing in this picture. The power of the scenes are definitely carried through the music, if the music were not there, it would have been a terrible mistake.\nThe music in this film is much better than Spirited Away's score in my opinion, I always felt the music in Spirited Away was just there to slightly enhance the mood, Not carry the whole picture like this score did. Only a master.\nThe seiyuu all do a great job with they're roles. The way most of the seiyuu act their roles has a very subdued calmness to it that I have not heard in most anime. This can a be a good and bad things. I felt they were not expressing enough feeling at some parts of the film, like they were not really yelling when they could have been. But that's just me.\nThere's definitely character here. Ashitaka is the mediator to all sides of the field. Nature, The Gods, the Ironworks (Civilization), as well as San. The Gods definitely feel like gods, you know their roles in nature. San is a human who was left behind by her race, and left with the wolf god, she hates humans and always will.\nYakul, the ever so loyal companion of Ashitaka.\nEboshi is the leader of the Ironworks does her best to protect the ironworks she created, along with the woman she saves from brothels and the the men that help. There are many great supporting characters as well.\nPeople say that Spirited Away is overrated, and they are probably right. Technically, Princess Mononoke is perfect for this type of story. I don't have any problems with it, unlike some aspects of Spirited Away. \nBut there's something that's in Spirited Away that made me enjoy it more than this film, ever so slightly. It's not that much more enjoyable, they are very close, but I enjoyed Spirited Away slightly more. Despite that, this film is highly enjoyable, it will not bore you in any way, especially in the music department.\nPrincess Mononoke is a film that you do not want to miss if you are interested in Hayao Miyazaki, or even anime in general. There are some stories that are just too good to miss. \nThis is one of them.\n        "},

The film is about how terrible humans are and how we're all killing the environment. While I do hate these overused morals in Miyazaki's movies, I didn't bother me as much in Princess Mononoke partly because the setting was so unreal and partly because the rest of the movie is that good.

Large, powerful, very complex, still unknown, fragile and wonderful organism.

It's definitely hard to create fictional non-human characters to make people feel who they are, but here it was successful. You can feel strength, power, weakness, sadness, feeling of fate, rage - all those things represented by non-human individuals. It is both in their appearance, voices and manner of speaking.\nI know, that Hayao Miyazaki doesn't like how people treat nature. I have the same views. Watching it I've been immersed in the atmosphere of desperation and fate, same as I feel when studying maps of deforestation, climate change statistics, reading growing endangered species lists. It's a feeling of world falling apart, very hard, devastating and deeply sad feeling. And this is great, because somebody, who have never noticed that before in the real world, might finally look around and see similar things. In the same time, it is not a kind of \"green propaganda\".\nEnding seems to be happy, but only from very human-centric point of view, because it is not an equal coexistence they finally settled for there. Nature lost much more than people did, and people didn't actually learned any lessons. So, for those who have strong attachment to our real nature, it will not look \"happy\", just \"better than total destruction\".\nSummarizing everything, I want to say, that even being sad, it is great. \n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Princess Mononoke, or Mononoke-Hime as in the original Japanese, is an anime movie written and directed by Miyazaki Hayao of Studio Ghibli. The movie was released in Japan on July 12th, 1997, and later released in the United States and Canada on October 29th and November 16th, 1999 respectively. Studio Ghibli has produced such movie masterpieces as Spirited Away, Kiki’s Delivery Service, and the Cat Returns.\nPrincess Mononoke is a nice movie, definitely, but not the best one as everyone makes it out to be. The plot is fairly simple; Ashitaka, the last Emishi prince, battles a gigantic, sickly boar named Nago in order to save\n          \n        his village, during which his arm is wounded. He finds out that a curse will spread throughout his body from his arm, and will eventually kill him. The only way for him to get a cure is to go to the land where the boar came from. He journeys west, and comes across Iron Town. Soon thereafter, a mysterious girl in wolf’s skin enters the village, causing a ruckus that really gets the story started. Ultimately, the plot and the movie itself seem to promote caring for the environment, and the animals that live there. However, beyond that, there is a deeper meaning. All the characters have a reason to act as they do – they each have their own perception of what is right.\nThe movie keeps you engaged, combining Japanese mythology with a simple but original plot. Every single character’s actions can be justified based on the view point you look at them, which makes them well-developed and well-fleshed out. For me, though San steals the show – she’s just such an interesting character, although I may be biased because of the wolf aspect. Wanting to know what will happen to Ashitaka keeps you want to keep watching regardless if you find it really interesting or not, which I guarantee you will. There is not too much action per se, but each of the characters push the others into different situations that force them to react. Cause and effect – another thing the movie exemplifies. Ashitaka kills a boar because it is attacking his village – he needs to save his home. The boar was, in fact, a god that was berserk, and in pain. The boar cursed Ashitaka, in defence of his own life. Cause and effect – the boar caused Ashitaka to attack it, which in turn caused the boar to harm him, which is the entire basis of the plot. Had Ashitaka not attacked the boar, the plot, the meaning behind the story most likely wouldn’t exist.\nBottom line, it is a movie with a message: don’t destroy the environment, care for the animals, too. I like animals, so I like this message. Summarizing, the movie is a good one and worth watching. However, it is not the most amazing movie ever.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Princess Mononoke is a very important anime that many people forget. It costed 16 years of his life to bring the film to the screen and it's one of the most expensive anime, costing 2.35 billion to make this movie and it surpasses Akira's big budget. Princess Mononoke was a huge success in Japan and in the US, but unfortunately the film didn't made a lot of money in the western box-office, as the film only made $2 million dollars in the box-office in America, but I'm gonna talk about that later. I just watched the film and I have to say this; This is\n          \n        the most beautiful, thought-provoking and powerful anime film in the history of animated films, it took Miyazaki years to come up with this film and he nails it perfectly with this one and this is now my new favorite film from Miyazaki.\nPrincess Mononoke is about Ashitaka, a strong fearless warrior who defeats a boar god, in which he became a demon filled with rage and hatred in his flesh and heart. During the fight, Ashitaka gets infected with the demons curse and therefore, he gets banished from the village and now he must find \"The Forest Spirit\", a guardian who protects the forests and the purified lands. to find a way to lift the boar's curse from his arm. Later, Ashitaka comes across Irontown, a town who makes hard steeled iron and it's led by a woman named Lady Eboshi, a woman who once killed a god in her days and wants to kill The Forest Spirit in order to gain a powerful and richer land for her people. But later that night, she's attacked by Sen, a fearless woman who has a deep hatred to the humans and was raised by wolves when she was abandoned by her parents, tries to kill Eboshi, but it backfired. Now with the balance of man and nature in danger, Sen and Ashitaka must put their differences aside and save the world from an impending doom. \nThe story in Mononoke has a environmental message, but it's more than just that. It's about the balance of life and nature itself, as we humans walk blindly into our own destruction, showing no respect to the laws of nature and therefore, destroying the balance of nature and life altogether. Also there aren't villains in this film at all and all the characters in this film are very human. Lady Eboshi isn't some evil wicked bitch trying to take over the world, she's just a brave woman leading her people to live on and doing her very best to protect them, even risking her own life. Ashitaka and Sen are also well written characters. Sen wants the humans to be gone because of the destruction of the forests that humans were responsible for it, but when he meets Ashitaka, she realizes that not humans are all of destruction and that maybe humans have a will to change their ways in life. Ashitaka is a warrior with good heart and he is trying his best to save his life from his fate, but wants the humans and nature to live in harmony rather than seeing the humans and animals killing each other for a land. There are also many other characters like Jigo, who's a corrupt priest in the inside but a nice friend on the outside and so on.\nAlso, Princess Mononoke has the most lavished and colorful animation of all the Ghibli films. The amount of detail put in the backgrounds and character models is just amazing, even for a movie made in the 90's. The lavishing backgrounds give a sense of wonder, beauty and mystery during the forest scenes that it's a miracle to behold and considering the very high budget that was put into making the animation for this movie, I say they did a phenomenal job with this film. The action in Mononoke is intense and brutal. Heads get blown off by arrows, humans using grenades to blow up a whole army of boars and blood comes everywhere, it's just a huge and epic battle to the next. The English dub cast is one of the best dubs in anime dubs and that's because Neil Gaiman wrote the English script for the Princess Mononoke dub and the cast that was selected for the dub. Billy Crudup as Ashitaka was excellent, giving a very profound and deep performance to his character, while Claire Danes gives a fearful performance as Sen and Minnie Driver gives a very rough but strong performance as Lady Eboshi. Billy Bob Thornton as Jagi was not that bad in his role and I thought he did perfectly fine with his performance on the character, so I don't get much of the hate with the casting choice here. The music by Joe Hisaishi is powerful and moving, every time I hear that orchestral theme of the movie, I truly feel the power and emotion that Mononoke brings into this film and this score puts other musicians to a huge shame, even TDK theme is no match for this masterpiece.\nNow before I end this review of this masterpiece of the anime, you are wondering why this film was a failure in the box-office in the US? Well take the blame on Miramax and The Weinstein Brothers. Apparently, Disney gave the US distribution rights to Miramax, cause Disney would not dub a violent film, but then the folks at Miramax wanted to cut all the violent footage of Mononoke and getting a PG rating for the American audience. Hayao Miyazaki saw the news and forbid them to cut any footage of the film and therefore, the film received a PG-13 rating to make sure that the footage, that he worked so hard in his life during the film's production, was shown for the audience. Miramax spent their money on creating the dub for this film, but decided to promote the film with one theatrical trailer for the US release of the film and thats how the movie bombed like a bitch in the box-office, cause a bunch of lazy dumbfucks did not even bother to spent their money on making a better marketing for this film and hell, they had enough money to make a better marketing campaign for the film, but nope... They just made one trailer and never bothered to promote more stuff for the film. it's just a shame really, giving the US rights to a bunch of lazy and whinny assholes who were pissed cause they weren't allowed to tone down the film. But enough about that, Princess Mononoke is a must-see anime film and it's a true landmark for Western and Japanese animation for years to come. It's powerful, moving, dramatic, wonderful and it's a really big film and it's time that this movie gets a proper re-release from Disney, cause there's a lot of people out there that haven't even seen this film yet. So what are you waiting? Spread the word around and see Princess Mononoke.\n        "},

They are either looking left or right. Check the movie if you don't believe me. It appears that Ghibli doesn't know how to draw faces looking directly ahead, or it ends up looking very ugly if they do, which is the same thing. \nThe action in this movie is not quite on the same level as Sword of the Stranger.

I was barely out of my teens, naive, and tried to write a review that wasn't a synopsis. It contains hyperbole, a smiley-face (for which I apologize), and factual errors (I've since learned that Princess Mononoke contains quite a lot of CGI, but maintain that it's some of the most subtle use of CGI I've seen in an animated film). With all this in mind, I think if anyone clicks \"Not Helpful\", that says more about you than it does about the\n          \n        review. Here it is:\nPrincess Mononoke (screened in Japanese with English subtitles) is IMHO the perfect Japanese epic. For those that liked Crouching Tiger but wanted a more coherent story, Princess Mononoke delivers, and then some. The story is a simple folk legend (like the Aboriginal Dreamtime tales) set in medieval Japan when gods and humans walk the land side-by-side. The story deals with the time when this balance begins to change, and what effect it has on the world. Sounds a little “Greenpeace”, but remember this is a folk legend, and they usually always have a moral.\nBut what a way to express such a moral! The animation is so beautiful in parts you’ll think the forests and mountains covered in fog are real... and I don’t just mean CGI (of which there was none used in the making of the film), but it actually looks photo-realistic. The action sequences are a wonderful blend of traditional anime and lifelike fight & battle sequences. The music should have won an Oscar, etc. etc.. :-)\nAnd to top it all off, this is no Disney flik!\nNo singing monkeys and dancing pigs to be seen here. The wolves have teeth, and use them. When someone is decapitated, they don’t get up again. And the emotions of the characters are real & subtle, as opposed to over-the-top goodies vs baddies.\nIf you like anime, go see Princess Mononoke now.\n If you love anime, why haven’t you seen it already? \n If any of this sounds remotely interesting and you haven’t seen  Princess Mononoke yet, you should.\n        "},

Though they’re trying to increase their\n          \n        power and areas of the land, they need the forest to survive. Quite literally, they need plants to synthesise oxygen! Obviously they learn that a little too late. \nThe relationship between Ashitaka and San (Princess Mononoke) is turbulent, yet intertwined with the plot. As soon as he lays eyes on her, he is enchanted by the fierce wolf girl. After saving her from a vicious battle, she begins to trust him and take care of him too. The two really are star crossed lovers as she belongs to the animals and he is a protector of humans. Yet they cannot help but be drawn to the other. Their ultimate teamwork skills in resolving the differences between humanity and nature really right the wrongs of all that happens. \nAshitaka is a strange protagonist. He simply cannot make up his mind about whose side he should be on. He kind of gets by without making a decision which enrages San, but allows him to be the mediator between the worlds. I personally would have preferred him fighting with San on the side of nature and making the humans regret their actions as the ending feels dissatisfactory in that regard, but I was content with the way things panned out.\nSan and her adoptive wolf mother Moro had the most heartwarming relationship. It truly broke my heart when I saw them separated. The talking wolf mother absolutely loves the human child castaway by the humans and if that doesn’t foreshadow their ability to coexist in harmony, I don’t know a better plot device that could. \nThis movie explores the blockheaded nature of the leaders of war. They both are just so stubborn for their cause that they cannot be content with what they already have. Though you are drawn to be on the side of the wolves and the boars that are having their homes destroyed, you cannot help but see from the evil lady Eboshi’s perspective. She is trying to gain more land for her Irontown, but she is also creating more jobs for lepers and women by buying them from brothels and thus saving them from a life of submission to men. She believes she’s doing the right thing by attacking the wolves and boars. Her ultimate goal is to kill the Deer God, the heart of the forest. The real snakes in war are the strategists though. Jiko-bo is the real snake, trying to plan a way to leave the deer God vulnerable by using lady Eboshi. \nThe imagery of the deer God and the weird creatures of the forest is truly magnificent. He is this ethereal creature that heals, sustains and maintains the balance of the world. Yet it’s never clear why he doesn’t cleanse Ashitaka of his curse. Perhaps because he knew of the role Ashitaka had to play in bringing peace between the worlds. The music was remarkable and enrapturing. It really captures the beauty and turmoil of every scene. There were some pieces that will stay with me forever as the melodies were so magical. \nThis movie defied my preconceived expectations! As soon as the cursed boar showed up with his weird malicious form, crawling with leech like creatures, I knew I was in for a wild ride. There is gore galore, but it all carries significance and is not just thrown in there for dramatic effect. Watch this if you’re after a thought provoking, thrilling escape to a world facing the repercussions of war. \n        "},

Set in feudal era Japan, Princess Mononoke is focused on a young prince named Ashitaka who is banished from his village after being cursed by a boar god turned into a demon. As he travels the land, Ashitaka finds himself in the middle of a hostile conflict between residents of an ironworks village led by their strong woman ruler Eboshi and the animal gods of the\n          \n        nearby forest trying to protect their land from man's expansion of their territory. Among the wolves of the forest is a young woman named San who was orphaned as a baby and raised by the mentioned wolves to defend their land.\nPrincess Mononoke employs many of the typical themes and story elements you would find within a Ghibli work with environmental themes, strong female characterization and no defined villains. The environmental themes come into effect with the preservation efforts that San and the other animals within the forest are doing against Eboshi and the ironworks village, with the destruction of the forest from the ironworks village being done to preserve its livelihood. This serves as a sort of symbolic clash between the natural environment and humanity's industrialized world that it continues expanding. The ironworks village consists of social outcasts within feudal Japanese society such as prostitutes and lepers that Eboshi had taken to her side to maintain and protect the village she governs, creating the lack of defined villains within this movie as both sides have justifications for what they are doing to preserve their livelihoods.\nFemale characters such as Eboshi, San and the prostitutes making up the ironworks village consist of the strong female characters that are found throughout Princess Mononoke. While willing to take action to protect the sides they support, these characters also have a good deal of depth to them exploring their mentalities and actions throughout the course of the film. This same focus also extends to Ashitaka who plays the role of neutral party within the conflict as he tries to resolve it without both sides wiping one another out, coming to understand how each group views their situation while trying to cure himself of the curse he sustained at the start of the film.\nIf it is not apparent from what I have highlighted in the review thus far, Princess Mononoke mixes around historical and supernatural lore with its storytelling. Outside of the animal gods, supernatural creatures like kodama and a daidarabotchi are seen regularly throughout the film. In addition, the historical elements of the film are believably depicted with villages being at war with one another to expand their territory, Ashitaka's Emishi village seen at the start of the film being on the decline and Eboshi's village being an uncommon sight for feudal Japan with its feminist-dominated society and acceptance of social outcasts.\nIssues with the movie mostly come down to nitpicking. There are a few characters left rather underdeveloped like those among Ashitaka's village and Jiko-bo. While this would be forgiving for the former since they have no prominent role within Princess Mononoke, the latter only exists to push along the plot and doesn't have many defined characteristics to his character compared to major players like Eboshi and Ashitaka. Also the movie may not be appropriate to show to younger audiences as the violence is greater than average for a typical Ghibli film featuring graphic scenes like the decaying bodies of animal gods, decapitations and dismemberment.\nVisually, Princess Mononoke is of Ghibli's typical excellent quality as it sports excellent scenic shots of the forest landscape, detailed character designs and fluid animation. The designs of animals make for the character design highlight with their realistic details and action scenes depict fluid and intense movements consistently throughout its run without any loss of detail or apparent shortcuts. The movie makes some use of CG animation that blends in seamlessly with the normal animation style implemented throughout Mononoke, mainly with Ashitaka utilizing the supernatural power of his curse and one of the final conflicts in the movie. \nOverall, Princess Mononoke is among one of Studio Ghibli's best offerings in the execution of its normal themes that are implemented into a feudal Japanese setting with fantasy elements. This is a definite recommendation for any anime fan starting off their fandom with a love for any works made by Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki.\n        "},

That being said, it isn't the greatest story of all time either. It was slightly predictable at times and the pacing was a bit off.\nArt/Sound: 9/10\nAs with any Ghibli film, it should be expected of the quality put in and it speaks for itself.

But at the same time, we don't know much about them, only what we--as the audience--gathers and inquire. My most irksome point in the story would be that Eboshi (the leader of the fortress) did a complete 180 at the end of the film; at first, she was against the forest, believing she should drive them (the creatures within) away, making space to expand her land so she can achieve her goals. And through all the ordeals and revelations, she doesn't budge and keeps with her mission. But after that certain significant event is resolved, she suddenly decides to leave the forest alone. It's ridiculous. \nEnjoyment: 10/10\nBut regardless of Eboshi's sudden character change or not, the film was overall enjoyable and memorable (especially the creepy face of the Spirit of the Forest). But I'm one that is easily pleased and only noticed the few errors afterword. I only wish I could've seen it subbed. \nOverall: 9 (8.6)/10"},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    PRINCESS MONONOKE: Amazing in almost all departments\nFrom the mere premise, it is clear that Princess Mononoke is one of those stories that will require tremendous amount of world building. This is very crucial, because this kind of story is often victim of too much information dumping in the beginnings. But this is not the case for Princess Mononoke. The establishing of the world is perfectly interwoven with the main plotline, making the flow of the story very natural. Aside from that, this gives the viewers an impression that the world of Princess Mononoke is so vast that not even the story is able to grasp\n          \n        some of its aspects. This makes the viewers exercise their imagination and fill in the other details of the world.\nThe storytelling is also worth praising. It doesn’t dwell on random details, and every sequence drives the story to the right direction. However, in the middle of the film, the direction of the story seems to have a shift. In the beginning of the story, it is established that the goal is to find the cure for the curse. But half way through, the goal changes into convincing the people and animal gods to live in peace with each other. Don’t get me wrong. This is incredible storytelling. The shifting of goals is a good way to move from one story arc to another. In truth, it doesn’t feel like a transition of story arcs; the film itself feels like an overarching story. But the problem I have with it is the lack of focus on the original goal, as if it is just set aside to make the story more plot-oriented and less character-driven.\nSpeaking of characters, Princess Mononoke has its fair share of interesting ones. What I really like about the characterization is the fact that it doesn’t create a clear line between good and evil. This makes the characters more human and believable, and tells the viewers that nothing is purely evil just for the sake of it. The best example of this is Lady Eboshi, the one responsible for sparking the war between the animal gods and men. She shows sympathy to fellow humans, and she has goals that are noble and admirable. It just turns out that her ideals don’t coincide with that of the animal gods. San, the girl who the title is paying homage to, is also a worth-noting character. Her background is established but not portrayed, adding a sense of mystery in her identity. But this doesn’t make her a bland character, as many mysterious character in stories are bland. Her actions and relationship with Ashitaka clearly shows the depth of her character.\nAside from the story and characterization, Princess Mononoke is also excellent in the department of themes and symbolisms.  To put it simply, the film is a huge allegory of the battle between nature and humankind. The amazing thing about this is that it is not spoon-fed to the viewers. The underlying concepts are there for the viewers to dissect on their own.\nOverall, Princess Mononoke is an excellent film. It strives in story, storytelling, characterization, character development, and theme. These departments are all done so well that seeing them interwoven in a singular plot makes them more powerful and influential. Layered with incredible musical soundtracks and detailed animation, they become even more powerful and influential! This is a must-watch for both anime enthusiast and not. I couldn’t recommend it more."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    	This is my favorite movie of all time. I believe it is a masterpiece of film-making in all aspects including acting, music, animation, and story. Princess Mononoke deserves all of the fame and recognition among anime fans and non-anime fans.\n	Let’s start off with the acting. It’s fascinating how both the English and Japanese language versions of the movie have good acting when some animes either favor one or the other. Since the English version has big name actors like Billy Bob Thornton and Minnie Driver, it shouldn’t be that much of a surprise. In the English dub, the voices match the movements of the mouths\n          \n        perfectly and don’t come out of sync. When the characters sound angry, they sound angry.\n	The music is fantastic! Music composer, Joe Hisaishi gets every tone down perfectly from the mellow quest music to the harsh battle music. Whether the music has vocals or not, each song matches the scenes. My personal favorites include “Journey to the West”, “The Tarata Women Work Song”, and “The Legend of Ashitaka.” “Journey to the West” stuck out to me because the music matches the visuals perfectly as Ashitaka leaves his home village and as the dynamics rise, so does the imagery of all of the beautiful landscapes. I couldn’t help but hum along with “The Tarata Women Work Song” since it sounds like a traditional Japanese folk song or festival song and has a tone that balances out the dark industrial town. Finally, “The Legend of Ashitaka” sums up the entire movie. It has a quiet brooding beginning and then transitions to a more uprising and flowing movement.\n	Speaking of flowing movement, the animation in this movie is very impressive. Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli always deliver great animation in their movies, even the less-than-successful films. Even though I have seen this movie several times, I never get tired of looking at the beautiful backgrounds of each scene. These include the forest settings, the different villages, and the mountainous landscapes, which capture the true essence of Japan. I’ve been to Japan a few years ago and I must admit that they get the scenery spot on. It’s interesting that this is the first Ghibli film to use computer animation because it moves so smoothly with enough colors that it’s hard to tell that computers generated the images.\n	This is one of the few movies that I can watch over and over again and almost never get tired of it. Simply put, it’s one of Miyazaki’s best films. Since it’s hard for me to find any faults with this movie, I give it a perfect 10/10 on MyAnimeList and a 5/5 on Rotten Tomatoes.\n        "},

I wouldn't say this anime is great because it is awesome. The characters are extraordinary like any other character in studio ghibli's films.
