But just before his demise, he confirms the existence of a great treasure, One Piece, located somewhere within the vast ocean known as the Grand Line. Announcing that One Piece can be claimed by anyone worthy enough to reach it, the Pirate King is executed and the Great Age of Pirates begins. Twenty-two years later, a young man by the name of Monkey D. Luffy is ready to embark on his own adventure, searching for One Piece and striving to become the new Pirate King. Armed with just a straw hat, a small boat, and an elastic body, he sets out on a fantastic journey to gather his own crew and a worthy ship that will take them across the Grand Line to claim the greatest status on the high seas.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1018, ["text"]="               \n    Frequently categorized with both Bleach and Naruto as one of the Shonen Big Three, One Piece is a romantic tale of pirates, treasures  ...talking reindeer, panties, flying skeletons, Takoyaki selling Octopuses, and oceans roaming with Sea Monsters the size of which can take down fleets of ships. Crazy enough for you? This is the world of One Piece.\nBeing categorized with Bleach and Naruto, on the surface this might strike an unfamiliar reader as another generic uncreative Shonen series; but truthfully, comparing One Piece to Bleach and Naruto would be like comparing Disney World to an elementary school playground. If these three series are the\n          \n        big three, then One Piece would be the boss sitting on a lavish chair smoking a cigarette, while Bleach and Naruto would be the two henchmen standing side by side of the boss and nodding at everything he says. \nStory:\nSet during the Golden Age of Pirates, the story follows Monkey D Luffy as he sets sail with his crew to conquer the sea which is inhabited by formidable pirates who all aim to become the Pirate King, the Grand Line and claim the treasures of 'One Piece' left by the late Pirate King, Gol D Roger.\nOf course the goal of being Pirate King really is just a loose objective set forward that eventually throws Luffy and his shipmates into a giant boiling pot full of problems and adventures.  What's special about this story is that it takes the most run-of-the-mill concepts and turns it into something fantastic and exciting. The concept of traveling from drastically different locations after locations is filled with endlessly creative characters and creatures that sets it apart from ever being dull, as opposed to say, Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle where traveling to new worlds is a borefest and you can only hope the next world is interesting, and well if it's not ...have fun reading an entire arc on that filled with recycled characters.\nThe main plot device used in One Piece are the Devil Fruits, which grant anyone that eats them inhuman powers though at the deadly price of sinking like an anchor in the water; here the strange irony being that this is a series about pirates constantly on water. What makes this concept actually interesting is that every fruit has a different power and no two powers are the same, and Oda's endless imagination to come up with strange and hilarious powers. Above that, what makes this concept better than say, Bankai's or Kekkei Genkai's, is that you never know how two powers match up, so the weakest Devil Fruit powers in the current arc could very well be the key factor to winning a battle in the next, in that way, none of the characters ever seem so overpowered that they can completely destroy the other characters and it certainly adds an air of suspension and excitement to the battles that you wouldn't find in something like Sasuke vs. Konohamaru.\nThe story of One Piece may be simple and often straight out silly at times, but if you read deep enough, you'll realize that oftentimes the stories are much deeper and well-crafted than you would think they are, from the spark of a rebellion through misunderstandings to the questioning of an unfair God, One Piece can often surprise you through the story. One of the great things about One Piece when it comes to the story is that it's unpredictable, you never know where a fight is going, what's going to happen to the characters, who's going to win and who's going to turn out to be a good guy and who's going to be a bad guy, it's this element that makes everything that happens so intriguing and an extremely fun read.\nAnother well-done part of the story is that the stories of the characters are all intertwined so that it doesn't seem like the only thing holding all these characters together is through the main protagonist, the main antagonist of one arc may very well know the supporting ally of the next, and that just contributes to a more interesting read. Another strong point of the story is that Oda isn't afraid to bring back old characters, be it enemies or comical side characters and villains, they aren't just cut out of the story once their arc is over, they come back, some as allies and friends, this, in a sense, really fleshes out the One Piece world and makes the reader feel that the world does not revolve around The Straw Hat Pirates, but instead, the pirates of the Grand Line, all in all, it adds a sense of dimension to the story and makes it feel not as linear as it could be in the hands of a less skilled mangaka.\nBut what ultimately makes the story of One Piece so grand and exciting is thanks to two major components: 1) the emotional depth, and 2), Oda's masterful storytelling. The emotional depth in this series is amazing and can oftentimes leave one speechless, from the simple departure of a character to join the Straw Hats to the rescue of a friend in need, it's not emotionally complex ...it's just plain raw emotion of wanting to be loved or the sadness of losing a friend yet it achieves such a level of pure emotion and excitement that the likes of Bleach and Naruto can only dream of achieving. Now the second component that makes One Piece great is how Oda tells the story, he can build up the story to the point where you can feel the urgency, the sense of despair, and the feeling of something great happening. He creates cliffhangers, yet never makes it irritatingly frustrating, he inserts flashbacks, yet they never feel out of place or annoying to read, and the way he builds up the fights is just, for the lack of better worlds, epic. People say Gurren Lagann is exciting, well I'd like to see those TTGL fans have a taste of what it feels as the Straw Hats infiltrate Enies Lobby or when The Eleven Supernovas gather at Sabaody Archipelago.\nCombine this with the perfect blend of humor (this manga is absolutely hilarious) and the sheer creativity of Oda and you got yourself an adventure of unequaled proportions.\nArt:\nThe bad thing with the art is that Oda's action sequences are so fast-paced and ambitious that it often times becomes muddled and a bit too messy; it gets hard to tell what's happening in these fight scenes and it takes a bit of imagination to understand what Oda is trying to do with these fight scenes, or else they come off rather cheesy at times, such as Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Gatling or Zoro's Kiki Kyūtōryū: Ashura.\nThe good on the other hand outweigh the bad of the art through the creative character designs that Oda just never seems to run out of, even if it's a character that appears in one panel and may never show up again, the utmost attention is given to his/her design so they never appear out of place compared to the other crazy designs he gives his characters. From the Okama Mr. 2 to the CP9 crew, the characters are all so different in appearance, size, and demeanor, it's hard to imagine how Oda keeps up. The sheer variability of the Straw Hat crew itself is a primary example of what a creative mangaka Oda is, as opposed to the recycled designs of his peers, Kishimoto and Kubo. Be it skeleton, reindeer, cyborg or witch, anyone and everyone is a likely candidate for the Straw Hat crew.\nAside from character designs, Oda really make the scenes feel cinematic and exciting, the tension and the sheer majestic and romantic quality of the adventure of the Straw Hats would never be fantastic without Oda's use of great art, from the crew getting ready to bombard Arlong Park to the storming of Enies Lobby, the examples go on. In short, Oda really knows how to pump you up through his art.\nLastly, the exaggerated expressions sometimes are just downright hilarious. I swear I laughed my ass off for at least five minutes when Enel made that huge WTF face after confronting Luffy.\nCharacter:\nThis is where One Piece is particularly strong in, and where this series shine at its greatest. One Piece's cast is colorful, hilarious, and unpredictable.  Currently, the Straw Hat crew consists of a rubber man, a pirate hunting pirate, a thief, a long nosed sniper, a womanizing cook, a transforming reindeer, a \"witch\", a cyborg that doesn't wear pants, and a walking skeleton.\nYep.\nEach character is unique, and when you throw a bunch like them together, the chemistry and interaction between the Straw Hat crew is comedic gold. And while they are almost always fooling around, each Straw Hat member has their own back stories that truly make them much deeper than what they appear to be at first. Brook is not just a joke character for variety, Nami is not just there to act like the straight man, Luffy isn't always a senseless fool, and Robin isn't just there to act like a damsel in distress (okay maybe she is ...kidding). The thing that needs to be pointed out is that the Straw Hat crew is a complex cast that is often much deeper than meets the eye.\nOutside the crew, both the friends the Straw Hat meet and the villains they confront are so freshly colorful and original, it never gets boring. The Shichibukai are just a perfect example of the variety of the One Piece cast, as well as CP9 and of course, Baroque Works. I would say it's pretty hard to find another cast so distinctive and creative as One Piece's. Of course the Devil Fruits certainly help in bringing the characters to life.\nLike previously mentioned, a strong point of the characters is how connected they are. The connections between characters are complex and can get pretty surprising sometimes. Who may appear as an old man could very well be friends with the former Pirate King and that whale that you saw at that mountain? Oh he's related to a guy you'll meet up with in a couple of hundred chapters. Some authors pull this kind of stuff out of nowhere (see: Kishimoto), but Oda plans out these kind of relations so intricately and carefully, you can't help but be impressed.\nAre there weak points to the characters? Certainly, there's a storyline that seems awfully repeated for the female crew-members of the Straw Hats, but the scale of the story is so big, that in the end, it doesn't matter that much and that one little slip-up never seemed like a big deal to begin with.\nEnjoyment:\nThis is the most enjoyable manga I have ever read. It's an absolute pleasure to read. Are there dull parts? At the beginning of every arc, there is always some exposition to be done, but once things enter full swing (and that is rather fast), damn, the chapters fly by in the hundreds, this is crack in manga form. If you want to know, I have spent entire days reading One Piece, that is how addicting this stuff is. With One Piece breaking records in sales in Japan, I think it speaks for itself when it comes to enjoyment.\nOverall:\nOne Piece is my favorite manga. Period. The story is such a grand and epic adventure, with each arc topping the previous; the characters are so tear-inducingly hilarious, and the art is so cinematic and exciting, One Piece is without the doubt, the greatest Shonen manga I've ever had the pleasure of reading, and I doubt it will be topped anytime soon, if ever, as my favorite manga series. Cheers to Oda for creating this Shonen masterpiece, and may he continue to keep on going, One Piece is a manga that I love and hope to read for many many many years to come.\nYohohoho a pirate's life for me~\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=807,  ["text"]="              \n    The key of success for many shounen anime is usually how well the anime is adapted from the manga.  So when people are disappointed with the results of the anime, they usually resort to simply just reading the manga and follow the storyline through that.  One Piece is a result of one of the few rare cases out there where the anime adaptation has followed the manga almost tooth and nail, with pretty much nothing lost within the translation between the two.  With the anime receiving high review results here on MAL, I decided to take a closer look at the manga,\n          \n        and as far as shounen stories go, see if One Piece lives up to the accepted truth that the manga is better than the anime.  This is not going to be your standard review.  Because of the popularity of One Piece, where most fans know what it is already about, I will delve into more of the concepts, ideals and symbolism that sets apart One Piece from its counterparts.\nWe begin with the story.  At this point in the game, I'm sure everyone who's reading this review or simply have been a fan of anime, know the general gist of what the plot is behind One Piece.  If you don't, I will be the first one to say that you're probably living under a rock.  Either that, or you're living at the north or south pole, isolated away from the anime civilization itself.  Without straying too much off topic here, One Piece is a story about Monkey D. Luffy and his ragtag group of pirates, all trying to accomplish their respective goals, enduring hardships, heartaches, laughs, sadness, happiness and everything in between.  As you read from chapter one and all the way through the latest arcs, you'll be unveiled to so many creative story developments, places, people and idea.  That is what makes One Piece so fun, the creativity of it all.  Eiichiro Oda (the manga-ka) has created such an amazing and unique world that it is something that you will have a hard time finding in other anime, if at all.  Though the story seems simple at heart, as you read deeper into One Piece, you'll be unveiled to secret plots and hidden agendas that will have you shaking your legs in anticipation to see how everything will mesh together in the end.\nThe big difference in regards with the story of One Piece as compared to other shounen is the fact that the story actually gets better as the series progresses longer, breaking the age-old cliche that shounen titles usually carry, where the story will start to suffer the longer the series goes on.  Oda has managed to introduce a plethora of different sub-plots that he flawlessly weaves together with the overarching aim of the story about friendship, the sense of adventure and the joys and heartaches that come with the pursuit of your dream.  It takes awhile for the sub-plots to start developing, as Oda will subtlety leave hints and clues early on in his story that will blow you out of the water when you encounter them much later.  This clearly shows that Oda knows exactly where he wants to go with the story. \nOne Piece has fallen under heavy scrutiny from all kinds of anime fans because of the different art style that Oda utilizes in his epic story.  Honestly, it is a hit or miss.  I have found that you will either love it or hate it and as a result, will either love One Piece or hate the anime.  As unfortunate as that sounds, its the simple truth I have discovered about the art style.  However, I do urge you to give it a shot because if there is anything that grows on you, it is this art style.  As you read more and more and get used to seeing the art drawn \"One Piece style,\" you'll - hopefully - grow to accept and love the style.  The art style starts off not so great, but again, as the story develops, you can easily see how Oda and his assistants were able to refine the art to something that works, and looks, beautifully.\nGoing into other aspects of the drawings, everything is relatively easy to follow, especially the epic fights as compared to other shounen manga out there.  It's a nice change of pace where you can actually understand what's going on.  Backgrounds are given a nice amount of detail and character designs are original and fresh, with different arcs having characters with different clothes and such.  \nArguably, the biggest strength of One Piece, that brings it over the top, is the characters and their developing relationships with one another.  Luffy's crew has the most original and different mannerism characters you'll ever see in shounen anime and its a wonder how they all get along in the first place (then again, they all don't get along).  Though Luffy is your typical shounen hero who is not bright, a black hole for a stomach (though in One Piece, his huge appetite has an actual reason behind it) and courageous when needed, what sets Luffy apart from other shounen heros is his hilarious personality.  His comic relief is so funny that you'll be laughing out loud at some of the things he does.  The same can be said about the other crew members, and really, every major character in One Piece itself.  All characters have a defining trait or quality that you'll either love to pieces or hate with a passion.  Watching as they interact with one another and often times their completely opposite personalities clashing with one another, it only provides great room for developing relationships between the many characters in One Piece.\nAnd it is these great developments between characters in One Piece that leads to the biggest theme the encompasses One Piece - friendship...or as stated a seemingly infinite number of times - nakama.  However, the word nakama, though commonly referred to as friend, comrade and such, has a deep-rooted meaning that cannot be described in words.  More than friends, bonds running deeper than blood can tie people together, you get the picture.  In order to understand the meaning, you really need to immerse yourself into One Piece and until you hear/read Luffy (who, by the way, is the only character who can say I will protect my nakama and look cool in doing so) say exactly that.  \nWhen you come right down to it, what sets apart One Piece from other long-running shounen is the plethora of genres that not only exist in One Piece, but really come alive and apparent.  To begin with, an essential part of One Piece is it's comedy.  While other shounen try to input comedy as much as possible, usually it doesn't live up to expectations or is very scarce within the story.  One Piece is filled with comedy that, as I stated up above, will make you laugh out loud.  And this is only accentuated by the great drawings of Oda himself.  \nHowever, as much as the humor is a big part of One Piece, there are also many stunning events that will draw a lot of passion out of you, whether it be a feeling of sadness, happiness, anger or simply have you staring in the page at awe, Again, I cannot stress this enough that One Piece is a story that has every single plot element you can wish for.  Well, with the exception of a true romance, but because of the nature of the characters, it's kind of hard to see a budding romance evolve.  And as a result, Oda wisely has left it out to date.  You'll see a everything from mystery, suspense, drama, a little dash of horror, etc.  \nOverall, for roughly every two or three die-hard fans of One Piece, you'll probably find one person who can't stand the series.  Which pretty much goes to show you that regardless of what rumors you may hear about how amazing or how ridiculous One Piece is, it is something you must experience for yourself and give it a fair chance.  I will play devil's advocate and say that One Piece is slow to start off with, where the story really doesn't pick up until the Arlong Arc.  Until Luffy recruits the first four or five crew members, then the hilarious character interactions start coming alive.  And coincidentally, that is when the plot starts to hit its stride, with Oda starting to leave his hints of what's to come later.  It does take some patience.\nIf anything, I urge you to read up to there and a little further so you can get a sense of what's to come.  If you still can't understand why its so epic, its safe to say you may drop the series.  However, when you compare One Piece to other shounen anime of its kind, and really, all anime and manga to date, there is no other story out there as epic, as emotional, as developing, as truly amazing as what Oda is telling in One Piece.\n        "},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=367,  ["text"]="          \n    One Piece is the most overrated piece of fiction I’ve ever read. It’s mostly about a roaming crew of do-gooder clichés that travel the high seas. Each character has a dream (which they will never achieve because this cash cow will never end) and of course a tragic backstory to go with it. One Piece is somehow popular while having the worst character designs in anime, includes countless scenes of characters sobbing like crybabies, and will drag on to the point no one will care anymore. Honestly, if you want a shonen that doesn’t insult your intelligence and make you feel like you’re reading something\n          \n        written by a smarter than average 10 year old, then don’t pick this up. \nStory: While there are some decent dramatic moments here and there, they’re almost always forced as much as possible and accompanied by over the top water faucet tears or something else as corny that makes you want to punch a hole in the wall. Not only that, but it’s the same thing each time. \nStraw Hat crew arrives at an island, the people are friendly but something is wrong. We then meet the villain who is doing stereotypical villain things. Luffy hotheadedly decides he is gonna save the day and starts yelling. Luffy takes on the boss and his crew mates take on the underlings. They are stronger than expected, but through the power of friendship and encouragement from the people of the island they will themselves to victory with their new attacks they just invented. With everything said and done, celebration is had, and the Straw Hats leave as the citizens thank them and promise to always remember their kindness. Repeat for hundreds of chapters. If that sounds boring to you, then good, it’s very lame. \nLet me add that people harp on about how great the world building is, but the world is just a nonsensical LSD theme park with clouds you can stand on and other magical stuff that never gets a good explanation and you’re just expected to eat it up and suspend your disbelief.\nArt: Not much needs to be said here, One Piece’s art hardly looks like anime at all, but rather doodles from a 3rd grader’s math textbook.\nCharacter: Characters are terribly developed and never really change. Usopp remains a cowardly person forever, Sanji remains a scrawny Johnny Bravo knock off that is impossible to take seriously, Luffy remains an unlikable annoying man child \"who always stands up to the bad guy with no fear\" (that's all his character amounts to though, lol and there is no originality), Zoro is your cookie cutter \"badass\" character, etc the characters are bad, have no actual depth, and are uninteresting. \nEnjoyment: Clearly some people enjoy this, but I certainly didn’t. I read it in bursts, people kept trying to drill into my head how great it was so I kept going back, forced myself to read another 200 or so chapters, then got sick and put it back down. Now I write this review to tell you how lousy I think this comic is. \nOverall: One Piece is poor. Yes, Naruto, Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Death Note, and many others are great shonen stories that I encourage people to read and enjoy.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=227,  ["text"]="              \n    One Piece\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Comedy\nMangaka: Eiichiro Oda\nLength: 514 chapters, compiled in 51 volumes [So far. This manga has been going since 1997, and it shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.]\nRating: 9/10\n\nPlot: It is the grand era of the pirates, brought upon when the great Gold D. Roger was executed 22 years ago. Pirates from all over search for his great treasure, the One Piece, hidden in the treacherous waters of the Grand Line.\n\nOur adventure begins when an 8 year old boy, Monkey D. Luffy, eats the Gum Gum Fruit, one of the many Devil Fruits  -  a mystical fruit that will give you supernatural\n          \n        powers, while robbing you of your ability to swim. He gained the ability to stretch any part of his body, as he is now, quite literally, a rubber man. His dream is to become a pirate  -  and he does so, 10 years later. He travels the seas, picking up crew members, fighting against evil pirates and the Shichibukai, the pirate slaves of the government, and then facing the dangers of the Grand Line in order to capture One Piece and become the king of all pirates.\n\nAnalysis: It's a fun manga to read. When it started, it was only supposed to go on for 5 years or so  -  you can tell this just from the way the plot works out in the beginning. It moves along a lot faster and the fight scenes aren't as long as they get.\n\nThe characters are more loped on than anything  -  they aren't given much of a background before joining, and there isn't much reason for them to do so. However, later on, the manga gets very exiting. Characters are given a lot more depth before we even know that they'll be joining the crew  -  sometimes we don't even know if they'll be joining at all.\n\nThat being said, the plot of the manga is very good. Because its such an open ended dream  -  become king of the pirates, get one piece  -  there are many things that can happen in between. This is furthered by the grand line by itself  -  its made of up many islands, each of which has their own magnetic pull  -  you need a special device, called a lock post to navigate through the islands. In order to get the lock post to lock, you have to stay on each island for a specific amount of time, which can vary. Its basically an excuse to have an adventure, and it works out really well.\n\nAs the manga goes on, the characters start to reveal themselves more fully. It's the great part about having such a long manga, that you can develop the characters a lot. It also leaves room for very long fights, most of which are really well done. They're fun to watch, and they're filled with suspense. My only problem with them is this  -  the protagonist, Luffy, is extraordinarily strong, all due to his self training that was done during the 10 year time skip in the first chapter. We never actually see him training for anything. He gains one technique in one of the last arcs, and he made it up kinda spur of the moment. It just seems very unlikely that he can beat some of the strongest pirates in the world without training.\n\nFinally, there is the matter of the grand line. Ignoring the sheer impossibility of the entire place, in the first part of the manga, the grand line is described as a place full of horror, fear, death, and destruction. Now, while the latter two might be true [there certainly are a lot of fights there], it doesn't seem like something very scary. The only real big deal are the pirates who you can circumvent [or fight  -  if you're too weak, then shame on you]. Everyone makes a big deal about how scary the grand line is, but i just don't see it. Now, it is dangerous mind you  -  the weather patterns make it almost impossible to navigate, which makes for very scary waters to travel through. But nothing as to the extent that you are made to believe.\n\nNow, for fun, I thought that i would compare the pirates of one piece to the pirates of the real world [Yes, there is such a thing]\n\nFor the first part, the pirate ship does not work as it does in the manga. Its not a matter of who is the strongest in terms of fighting ability  -  rather, for the most part, it was done democratically, with the crew electing who the captain is. Their targets would not be a treasure, whether by following a map [of which the idea entirely came from Treasure Island], but any passing merchant ships. Most of the time, pirates would be working for a government  -  these were called privateers. It was often hard to tell the difference. Fights were not decided by who was the stronger fighter. They were usually decided by who caused the biggest amount of damage to the other ships. In most cases pirates would win without a fight, due to their fearsome reputation.\n\nNext is the pirate flag. The jolly roger as we know it, and as every pirate crew has [although edited some per crew] in One Piece, wasn't prominent in a lot of ships. Often it would be a black flag for fight to the death, or red flag for fight with mercy. If it wasn't this, then it would be a national flag to try and lure prizes [ships] into a sense of false security.\n\nPirates were not respected by most people. They were seen as barbaric brutes who only were out for themselves. This is almost the exact opposite as the manga  -  pirates are often seen as a hope for people, while some people hate them.\n\nThe fact that there are women pirates in One Piece is astounding. Now, i don't have anything against women, but in history there have only been 5 reported cases. There might have been more, but either way it is a very rare occurrence. The women pirates in One Piece are often very important members of the crews, and in some cases lead them as the captain.\n\nFinally, the last thing that I can remember is the noted lack of ships on the sea. Even before making it to the Grand Line, the only ships that you see are either pirate ships or marine ships. Its as though boats only exist for those two purposes.\n\nCharacter Summary:\n\nPlease note that I'm only going to do the first 5 crew members, who are the ones that appear before the Grand Line. I'm doing this in order to avoid spoilers to the maximum, because generally a character joins at the end of an arc. I'm also not covering the villians, because they are usually arc specific. Secondary characters are not being covered as well because, even this far into the manga, we don't know alot about the important ones.\n\nStrawhat Luffy, AKA Monkey D. Luffy: The hero of the story, he ate the Gomu Gomu Fruit [Gum Gum Fruit] when he was eight years old. Upon doing so, he gained the powers to stretch any part of his body to any length imaginable, however he gave up the ability to swim. He gained his nickname, Strawhat, from the straw hat that he always wears on his head. It was a gift from Red-Haired Shanks, a pirate whose crew used Luffy's town as base when he was young. It is his most treasured possession, and it becomes the symbol for his pirate crew.\n\nLuffy is a very simple boy. He has a strong moral code, and he's not too smart. However, he is a very strong fighter. He has high agility and strength, which he calls out to its fullest when used in combination with his rubber-stretching powers, which usually consists of him flinging his arm back, then letting it snap forward to hit his opponent. Its more complicated than that, but its hard to describe in words. He LOVES meat - it is the only thing that can give him enough energy to do anything.\n\nRoronoa Zoro: The second person to join Luffy's crew, and its 1st mate, he is a master swordsman. There is one difference between him and normal swordsmen however  -  he uses three swords [He places the third in his mouth]. He made a promise to a childhood friend/rival to become the greatest swordsman in the world, and as such whenever facing a swordsman he tries his hardest never to lose, even if losing would mean walking away alive. His strength is amazing [and his teeth are most likely made out of diamonds, as well as having a mouth as dry as the desert], and before joining the crew, was feared as one of the best pirate hunters. He has a fierce rivalry with Sanji [Look Below]\n\nZoro is a fun guy. Like Luffy, he isn't too smart, but he is very loyal. He has a terrible sense of direction, and as such usually gets lost. His skills, as mentioned, are very good. While he has not eaten any Devil Fruits, he can beat most of them. Fun fact about his attacks  -  most of them are named after food, and are puns. For example, one of the first 'special' attacks that he uses is Oni Giri. Oni means demon, and Giri means slash, so therefor it would mean Demon Slash. However, an Onigiri is a rice ball thats often eaten as a snack. The same is true for his swords  -  the kanji for them can be read multiple ways, mimicking food or something deadly.\n\nNami: The third to join the crew, she serves as the ship's navigator. Before joining them, she introduced herself as the pirate thief, stealing treasure only from other pirates. She is really one of the only ones with any brains in her head. She acts as the ship's conscience for a good part of the series, and while to start off she didn't have any fighting skills, they grew later on as a result of her feeling weak and helpless.\n\nWhen Nami first shows up, you don't know whether or not she is going to join  -  she disappears for a while, then shows back up. She is the first one to have a real strong plot and back story appear, and as such is very memorable.\n\nUsopp: The fourth to join the crew [Gee, I wonder if I'm going in some sort of order here ...], he is the ship's sniper. He has a very big head and is full of himself, often calling himself the captain before being shot down [Get it? He's the sniper and he's being shot down ... Ha ha ha ... Punny ... :(]. His father is a part of Shank's crew, and its partly for this reason that Luffy takes a liking to him. He's also a very big liar, and he loves making up stories to impress other people with his amazing, but very fake, deeds. For a lot of the series, he is a gag character, but he gains a lot of strength later on.\n\nUsopp is mostly used as comic relief. Until one of the arcs, he is not too strong, but his attacks are always fun to watch. He uses a slingshot to do his sniping with, and he has an assortment of bullets, ranging from explosions to hot pepper. Contrary to what it appears, he can analyze situations very easily. His most defining feature is his nose ... which sticks out a foot in front of his face. He is also a big coward.\n\n'Black Legged' Sanji: The fifth to join the crew, and the last to do so before the Grand Line, he is the chef of the ship. He was taught how to cook and fight by Red-Legged Sef, and as the name suggests, only fights with his legs. His dream is to find Deep Blue, a place where all of the oceans in the world intersect, that contains every species of fish imaginable. He loves women of all sort  -  except if they're ugly. But, even if they are, he will never hit a woman. The only times that he gets angry is when food/cooking is insulted, or if a woman is harmed. That, or any time that he is in the same room with Zoro, who as mentioned before, has a rivalry with.\n\nSanji is a good character. After Nami, he is the most level-headed of the crew, but he can still be an idiot sometimes. He is the third strongest in the crew, and like the first two, he has a strong code of honor. He constantly smokes a cigarette, which was changed to a lollipop in American versions of the manga/anime.\n\nOverall, I really liked this series. Its quite addicting, even though it is rather long. I read it in a week, which was only possible because I was under a bet and I kinda forgot about doing everything else during that time. I highly recommend reading this [But definitely at a slower pace than what I did. Maybe do like 2 volumes a night]. I wish that i could have written a better summary, but its hard to do so with this manga without giving anything away. Maybe in a bit I'll go back, look it over, and rewrite it. Here are some pictures depicting some of the fights  -  these aren't the best in the series, nor are these comedy shots. Like I said earlier, the manga gets a lot better as it gets on, in terms of fights and comedy. I tried to not go too far into the manga so as not to ruin anything, but these pictures don't fully represent how good this manga is. Not only that, but the quality of the manga increases - another good part about it being so long is that you can see the artwork change over time.\nreview taken from animeruwlez, check out my profile for more details\n        "},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=115,  ["text"]="          \n    STORY: 2/10\nOne piece is a shonen manga so I went in not expecting much story-wise, and I got what i was expecting. I just have to point out something first. This is a manga about pirates. They sail the high seas looking for treasure, fame, and fortune. They steal and they kill to get what they want, when they want. That's why they're pirates. But NEVER in the whole manga do they go searching for treasure except for one peice. They don't kill and they don't steal. So i'm sorry, in my mind they're not pirates. This is also one of those manga where nobody\n          \n        ever dies. No main characters die, no bad guys even die. The fights always end the same. Good guys win and the bad guys are knocked out. Same formula used 1000 times over. It gets old fast.\nART: 3/10\nI want to break this up into 2 catagories. Quality, and style. For the quality, it's pretty good. There is a nice amount of detail put into all the panels and you can really tell that the artist put time and effort into drawing this manga. Quality alone it gets a 7,8, or maybe even 9.\nNow to style: The next time i have to see a girl that has a bigger hand then a waist i'm going to kill somebody. It's completely ridiculous. Theres gigantic round people, stick women, and ridiculously sized animals. It's in all honesty, stupid looking. My eyes would hurt after reading just a few chapters in a row. Because of this it took me a fairly long amount of time to read 200 chapters. I had to keep taking breaks so my eyes could heal up from the ridiculousness. The art style drags quality down big time.\nCHARACTER: 2/10\nThe characters are your average shonen characters. The strong, serious guy. The goofy but gets stronger when he's mad guy, the just goofy guy, the talking rein deer (okay well that ones original)...but none of them have any development. Nothing original. Nothing unique. Just blah. Loofy is probably the worst. He's always happy and stupid. But when he fights he looses all his personality and gets all pissed, strong, and serious. Theres about a million main characters like that. There is just way too much genericness to rate them any higher.\nENJOYMENT: 1/10\nI had to stop at the sky island part. The character designs got so stupid I thought I was going to throw up. The fights all end the same. I can't even believe I made it that far in the manga. Nothing much else to say, just a pain to read.\nOVERALL: 1/10\nI hated this manga. It had a long, and horible story. God awful character designs to go along with god awful characters. I mentioned wanting to throw up at one point. It gets a well deserved 1 overall.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=94,   ["text"]="               \n    Thinking about reading this series? You are obviously skeptic. No kidding. You have every right to be dead scared to even attempt One Piece. I do not blame you, not at all. Most of us did not think we would like it at first, either. In this review, I am just going to simply tackle your skepticism and that is it. If you are skeptic, it is for one or more of the following reasons:\n1. Length- It is long. You may think that there is no possible way that you can follow a series this long. You may think that it could go downhill after\n          \n        awhile and let you down. \n2. Art- The art is crazy. It is absolutely nuts, and don`t let anybody tell you otherwise. You are completely right when you think that the art is weird, because it is simply that.\n3. Popularity- This is deadly popular and mainstream. Popular things often turn off one who likes intelligent anime, due to obsessive young fanbases or for other reasons. \n4. Genre- You may be a seinen fan, like me, or a fan of some other random genre. Either or, One Piece looks stupid and completely childish. You are not alone- it is acceptable to assume that your chances of liking this manga are slim. \nThat out of the way, of course I will tell you that this manga is good. What else were you expecting? I cannot sit here and try to give you a critical review, evaluate the pros and cons, because there are no major cons. I am completely beat. If you are searching for an intelligent review that effectively lists the pros and cons of this manga, it is going to be difficult to find. Any bad things in this manga are not even worth mentioning, because they are overshadowed by the awesome. That sounds immature, but it is absolutely true. The thing about One Piece is that you either really love it, or you really hate it. Isn't it the same for everything that is unique?\nNow, I will tackle the four points I made before:\n1. Length- Every reader that enjoys One Piece will be begging for more at the end. Once you get into it, the chapters will fly by. This series does not let you down. It keeps improving, honestly. Even after 600 chapters, it is still fresh and interesting. It also maintains structure. Even the stupidest people would not be able to follow One Piece religiously like they have. \n2. Art- Yes, it is screwed up. It takes awhile to get used to. Try to deal with it for a little awhile, because you will get used to it. Once you adapt to the strange art style, you may fall in love with it. You may find that the art is excellent at expressing both comedy and emotion. \n3. Popularity- The manga has extremely high ratings, no matter where you look.  Most popular things suck, I know. But my hands are tied. I do not want to be cliché and say that this is popular for a reason, but it truly does deserve its popularity. I mean, seriously, just look at it. This series is about colorful pirates. A. Rubber. Pirate. There is no way something like this could maintain high ratings and gain popularity among all ages without being good inside the book. \n4. Genre- One Piece is shonen, but it is also its own genre, and I will repeat this phrase. An interesting fact is that more adults read this series than kids. I can see why. It has more than enough material for adults to enjoy. It may give you a laugh when you are feeling suicidal. \nAnd maybe you won`t like this manga. Maybe you won`t like One Piece at all, but that is fine, because it is not for everyone. In my opinion, this manga is for anybody who is open minded to everything. Do not read it with the intention of dropping it, because you will do just that. Do not read it critically, trying to find extreme character and plot development, because this is a shonen. It does not have psychological warfare for seinen fans, or love stories for shoujo fans. Another thing that differs One Piece from other series’ is that it does not completely fall into the stereotypical shonen genre. While it is shonen, with its fights and non-stop action, it is something else entirely. I can`t even compare it to anything. It creates its own unique universe, and you will understand what I mean if you read it. And especially do not compare it to Naruto or Bleach, because One Piece is just too screwed up compared to them. While the shonen genre is generally screwed up by itself, this manga is an enhanced version of WTF. You need to be open minded to deal with it. I am calling One Piece is messed up, because it is, but it is also intelligent. \nDid I just call this retarded looking manga intelligent? Now you definitely must think I am stupid, and maybe I am. Heck, you need to be a little bit insane to enjoy this series. There are many different ways to define an \"intelligent series\", and I call a series is intelligent when the creator puts a lot of time, research, and thought into it. A manga is intelligent when it maintains enjoyment throughout. The characters come to life, creates its own world, and the audience does not feel like they are reading the manga, but they feel like they are a part of the action. A work is especially intelligent when it goes down in history. This manga plays a significant part of Japanese culture and it has affected the lives of people around the world. Of course, there are many other definitions of an intelligent work, and One Piece will fit most, if not all, definitions. You can tell that the creator is having as much fun drawing it as we are reading it. \nI may call One Piece intelligent- but remember, I am also calling it messed up. It is one of those things that is so weird that it becomes intelligent. You will not read anything else that can really relate to its craziness, because One Piece is a big gourmet dish made with insane ingredients. It looks awful, and when you first taste it, it may still be gross- but then after tasting it some more, you become starved without it.\nYes, it has a structured plot that is well planned out. Yes, it has character development. They are as multidimensional as shonen characters can possibly get. This is hard to believe at first, but One Piece is full of surprises. You will indeed end up falling in love and sympathizing with everyone. This series is highly enjoyable, and it will make you laugh. The character interaction is absoutely hysterical and you never get tired of it. Occasionally, it may even put you on an emotional rollarcoaster. Do not be afraid to enjoy this manga. If you like it, you will not regret reading it. It is not going to contaminate you. You can just stick with the manga, which is the only masterpiece in the series anyway. \nIt is not going to take your entire life to read it. There is no need to go on to the anime. However, you may feel the need to watch the anime, because the manga is that good. Just stop worrying, and just go try it. You may even end up finding out that, being as messed up and stupid as this manga is, it actually deals with a lot of real themes that express human nature and emotion. If you are not a shonen fan, but you are open to new things, give it a try anyway. Once you get comfortable with this strange series, you are in for one hell of a ride.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=79,   ["text"]="               \n    One Piece has officially hit its halfway mark, spanning from August 1997 - September of 2010. Yes, it has gone on for more than a decade, and it's only at its halfway mark. There will be some questions that will arise from those curious about One Piece from this little tidbit, but they'll be addressed. Anyway, I feel that since One Piece has its confirmed \"first half\" done, it deserves another review.\nOne Piece. The first thought that entered my mind when I hit the \"Write a Review\" button is \"...where do I even begin?\" This is a VERY difficult series to review, because you cannot\n          \n        simply describe it, it must be experienced.\nWell, let's get down to it. I must stress that if I was able to, I would give One Piece an 11/10, and that would be MILDLY putting my enjoyment of the series; I'd rather give it a 15/10.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - STORY: (10/10) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nWARNING: BEFORE ANYTHING IS SAID, I MUST WARN YOU THAT ONE PIECE GETS *SAD*! DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE ART!\nThis is the main draw of people to One Piece from my experience. So many things happen in such a short span of time. \"But it's gone on for over 13 years!\" you wail, \"Doesn't it drag?\" Not in the freaking SLIGHTEST. In fact, so much is jam-packed into the panels nowadays that some people think it's TOO fast-paced, but they're hardly complaining. After you watch an episode of One Piece then watch another show, you'll be tapping your foot impatiently saying \"Hurry up!\" The brisk pace of the story -- that somehow manages to never leave one stone unturned -- is a major perk of One Piece.\nBut what would a fast-paced story be without interesting events occurring within it? Many manga that are not One Piece, for one. But really, a story must be able to keep the reader's attention, and One Piece does this from chapter ONE. So many characters, ideals, oddities, etc. are introduced in chapter one that you can't help but wonder just where the heck these things will lead.\nAnd where they lead is a vast sea full of possibilities. Oda is often known for \"weaving\" his story \"flawlessly\"; that's because seemingly unimportant characters and objects introduced right in plain sight at some point may become HUGELY important later, all unbeknownst to the reader. And they all fit into the world and lore of One Piece, which is yet another amazing aspect of the series.\nThe world for One Piece is absolutely ginormous. While some anime may only take place at a school and a house or two, One Piece takes place at a variety of scenically eye-popping landscapes. These range from a humble gigantic fish-boat restaurant to a water metropolis that highly resembles Rome. The islands they've been to so far in the story are well in the tens, and each one is usually HUGE with its own sub-districts.\nThe world may seem like a paradise at first, but it can range from that to being absolutely chaotic. When the story picks up and they head to \"that place\", that's when shit hits the fan, and many more dangerous characters, weather conditions, struggle for survival, etc. all come into play. And that's another thing about One Piece, it can range from a paradise to absolute chaos in its story as well. One Piece will give you a full spectrum of emotions. Tears of joy (many times), tears of sadness (many times), tension, curiosity, freedom, excitement, horror (occasionally), hopelessness, et cetera. And that is because with the environments varying so wildly, so do the locales and personalities, which can cause clashes of ideals, and turn a fun little island stroll to a dark, drama-packed boiling pot that leaves your stomach unsettled.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ART: (10/10) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nAn initial turn-off for some for the series, a jumping-in point for others. Either way, if you haven't read the series, don't dare try to act like you know anything about the art.\nThe art has constantly evolved throughout the series, largely for the better, beginning with its humble simple cartoon-ish structure and eventually evolving into the super-detailed \"not-wasting-an-inch\" background-loaded megalith that it is today, still retaining its fun cartoon-y nature.\nThe art can range from \"raw\", to insanely detailed, to comedic. It all depends on what the story is demanding at that moment. In short, stick with it, and you will see the art slowly start to improve greatly throughout the series, leaving all other weekly series in the dust in terms of non-computer-generated detail.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - CHARACTER: (10/10) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nEven if One Piece didn't have its super-amazing-chocolatey-fudge-coated story, the characters would more than make up for it.\nWhile some stories may have their characters eating a slice of cake, One Piece constantly has gears moving. Every character you see is usually doing SOMETHING, and that ESPECIALLY applies for the major players. Don't like the fact that in other series one of the main characters hardly gets any time to shine? One Piece is the exact opposite in that it'll give even the ugly ducklings their extended spotlight.\nAfter reading One Piece for a while and kind of connecting with the way the author tells the story, you will notice that he absolutely ADORES his characters and cradles them like babies. Have that one character you saw a while ago and wish he came back? One Piece has done this with many, many of its characters, making them go from zero to hero in a span of episodes, when you thought you'd never see them again.\nOne Piece's characters range from ... HUFF *takes deep breath*: normal people, pirates, locals, giants, dugongs that know kung-fu, giant animals such as crabs and sky snakes, transsexuals (portrayed in a completely awesome way), demons, zombies, angels, mermaids, a talking skeleton ...... I think you get the point.\nNo matter how serious they are, 99% of the characters are zany in some way and have a quirk. And for a cast that has more than one thousand characters (1-0-0-0), I cannot think of but a handful that I dislike, and that's a slight dislike at that; can't stroke everyone the right way. One Piece is basically THE go-to manga for badasses, quirky characters, idealists, etc. But it mostly seems to pump out badasses like a gigantic testosterone-fueled assembly line. Most One Piece characters, from the seemingly simple crew to a mass-murderer-Hitler incarnate, have multiple, realistic dimensions to them. You could find the main character agreeing with the mass-murderer one second, then kicking his ass the next.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ENJOYMENT: (10/10) - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAs if the other things didn't put it ahead of other manga and anime, the sheer joy and emotion and heart you will get out of this masterpiece puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Only giant long-considered-classic monsters of manga are able to compete with One Piece, like Berserk, in enjoyment. From the interactions of the characters to the insanely detailed islands to every character getting a chance to shine to the sheer unpredictability, One Piece has MULTITUDES of things to cater to everyone, which would explain why One Piece is the most popular manga in ALL age groups in Japan, not just the teenage age group. One Piece is so enjoyed that its sales have been 23,000,000, with the next-leading manga being 3,000,000.\nBasically, One Piece is proof that popularity does not make something bad, and that a God actually does exist.\nIt is my favorite manga of all time, and it is Japan's as well. Just to give you a grasp of just how popular it is, they have STADIUMS devoted to One Piece in Japan. Oda (author of One Piece) was voted the 50th Most Influential Person in Japan, being the highest manga author on the list.\nPlease note, by reading this review you only know less than 0.1% of the series. Go read it, go watch it, go change your life.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=69,   ["text"]="          \n    One Piece is a monument in the manga/anime world. There is not another work that can be named that is so loved, so large, and so acclaimed.\nFor all that, though, the sensation lingers that maybe its faults have been washed from view by the massive wave of hype and adoration surrounding it. \nI have read One Piece, to the at-the-time current chapter, at least three times. It was always a struggle to maintain focus and interest. Several flaws continuously added upon themselves, until they drowned out my view. \nThis review attempts to address the many faults of the manga, from the most objective point of\n          \n        view--that of a reader who neither hates nor loves the series, who holds no real emotions towards it.\nSTORY\nThe story reads like the ecstacy-driven doodle-comics of a child. The various arcs are surreal in basis, and character designs are fantastical. This is not in and of itself a bad thing--sometimes it is amusing to see what the mangaka comes up with next--but after hundreds upon hundreds of chapters of zany crazy hijinks, it all blurs together. There is a constant high output of crazy; however, after so many readings, a tolerance is reached, and it is no longer remarkable or engaging. \nThere is a well-developed fan theory that makes what I feel is a conclusive case for the end of the manga. It points to many hints and threads carried throughout the arcs, and weaves a pattern for the rest of the show, based off of real historical accounts. Many point to this theory as a sign of Oda-sensei's ability to create great plots. This is very, very wrong. This fan theory, while solid in nature, was only noticed by one reader, who had an extraneous amount of knowledge on key parts of the subject. Foreshadowing serves a purpose in literature--its primary purpose is to hint at what is to come, but more importantly, it builds excitement in the readers, and by fueling fan conspiracy, allows fans to become engaged in the work. This fan theory, while solid, is based off of hints so subtle that the audience at large passed by them, unnoticed, and if not that, misinterpreted them entirely. The foreshadowing failed in this regard.\nART\nLike the story, the art is completely surreal. This is not to the benefit of the manga. Many will point to the elaborate backgrounds and surrounding action in large panels as signs of devotion and talent. I will not dispute the former, but the latter is definitely not the case. Artists need to be able to draw the reader's attention to important pieces of action. This is accomplished in many ways--through line thickness, framing, and level of detail. Oda-sensei fundamentally lacks the ability to focus layers of the background in meaningful ways. Some panels have so many details that just looking at them hurts. There is simply too much unsorted information to process, and it meshes together into a meaningless blur. In short, complexity and details do NOT automatically make a manga superior to any one or another. It requires balance, which One Piece lacks.\nCHARACTERS\nHere I will address both the general character design and the artistic design. The characters are, for the most part, loud, excitable, hooplah-generating machines. While there are characters who are \"quieter\", like Chopper or Nico, their characters often seem to get caught up in the overwhelming wave of energy that is mass-produced from other characters. I am certain that in any other manga these characters would be excessively loud in their own regard. \nBy loud, I mean that the characters lack much subtlety. They all have their reasons for sailing with Luffy, and they all have goals and dreams and backstory. However, their baseline personalities are caricatured versions of the person that these histories would've otherwise produced. Sanji is OBSESSED WITH WOMEN, Zoro is OBSESSED WITH SWORDS AND STRENGTH, Usopp IS A COWARD EXCEPT HE PULLS HIMSELF TOGETHER FOR HIS NAKAMA,  Franky ALWAYS NEEDS MORE MODIFICATINS, Brooks IS LITERALLY BONES AND MUSIC AND PUNS, Nami IS A STRONG INDEPENDENT WOMAN. It's all so superficial; they all lack nuance. It's boring and annoying and grating after 700+ chapters of the same shallow characterizations.\nOne of my largest issues with One Piece is the simple visual character designs. I understand that the manga is surrealistic; however, there is a limit to how noodly people can get (and I'm not just talking about Luffy!) If people are thin or normal, then they are streched out, strange thin bendable shades of people. The opposite does not improve the situation; when they are large, they are just a mountain with eyes and appendages. One can capture the essential form of a person and transform it into a surreal caricature which still manages to express the essential qualities of a person; this mangaka cannot do that. People become monstrous, and it eventually feels like I'm reading a webcomic about an entirely different species. \nOVERALL\nThe manga is popular. The manga is huge. The manga grosses more money than any other.\nThe manga's story has been the same theme for so long that it has lost its flavor. The manga's art shows severe deficiencies in simple framing abilities. The manga's characters are as shallow as the plot. \nIt's not terrible, being as large as it is. However, its size has blinded people to its very real faults. It's a good manga to read if you want to understand what your manga-loving friends are talking about; it's not the manga you want to read if you want a manga to digest, thoughtfully and slowly. The appeal of this manga comes from the community, not from the manga itself. \n        "},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=69,   ["text"]="          \n    One Piece... is just one decades long shonen battling series among others. Who likes what best and others not that much is a matter of opinion but saying that One Piece somehow objectively shines above all others is just masqueraded fanboyism.\nStory? It is stupid IMHO. The main hero Luffy just one day decides without any real reason that he's gonna become the KING OF PIRATES and be the person to find the mythical treasure One Piece that countless others have tried in the past and present. Yes he has a special power, but so do many others and I'm sure he couldn't be fully unaware\n          \n        about that. So how can he be so confident in himself? Making the character 'stupid' is not an excuse for poor character development IMHO. Which in turn is no excuse for a simplistic plot.\nAfter the average beginning the series goes totally downhill. Nowadays, it is too focused in inventing new sidequests after another, new islands after another, new strange powers after another so that the main story progresses nowhere in even a hundred chapters. Also every story arc is more and more comedy and less substance, which i suppose is the main reason why One Piece is slightly more popular than Naruto or Bleach, which may take themselves too seriously. But I for one like seriousness... So...\nMost characters rely only on their personality disorders with doing things, and their role in the series becomes clear immediately when they're introduced. And it barely ever changes. Nothing surprising ever happens character-development-wise. Even the cowardly Usopp's henshin into somewhat more heroic SogeKing totally fits his tendency to put up blatant lie shows so it's not real development. Side-characters likewise consist only of their 1) design 2) powers 3) a quirk or few.\nThe battles are IMHO duller than those in Naruto or Bleach. This is partly because the decisive move is usually something unbelievably weird stunt that only a person living in a quixotic world after watching too much comedy shows in a marathon would think of pulling out. Another reason is the concept of Devil Fruits which I liked and found having much potential. This potential however is wasted because some of the characters also have superhuman strength the origin of which is never explained, and their strength builds up linearly as the series progresses, and hence a character without Devil Fruit powers can be as strong as one having them, and a character with the powers can be much stronger or weaker physically than another user. This is stupid, and very generic.\nAlso some people claim it's objectively better that there's no knowing beforehand how two of the powers will do against each other. I think it's just a matter of taste, and like said above, even the potential for this to be really interesting is wasted, because the Fruit powers play only a little role in the grand scale. If a character loses Devil Fruit -wise they still can win by physical strength, and almost always do so. There simply is never the same kind of 'gaming' experience or excitement you find in the tournament arcs of some other shonen series, and good grief One Piece doesn't have one, it would be too boring for me to continue.\nThe only reason I gave it overall score that is \"bad\" instead of \"average\" is because there weren't any before, unlike with Naruto or Bleach which have many. It's not unreadable if you like series like it, but originality-wise it's definitely 1 like Naruto and Bleach."},

It has well developed characters with personalities all their own, fantasmic action and adventure portrayed in a believable format, and a sense of off the wall humor which leaves the masses laughing and gasping for air.\nHowever, along with these beautifully defined characteristics, it does something which other mangas, and most comics in general, fail to do. It captures real human emotion.\nThe adventures the characters partake in and the personal struggles they go through are ones which any person can relate to.\nWhile we may not stretch like rubber, fight with swords, or sprout extra appendages- we all have lost a\n          \n        loved one, been hurt by someone we care about, or have done something with good intentions which turned out bad.\nWe've all laughed, we've all cried, we've all felt emotions.\nWe follow the emotions with the characters best during the flashbacks, where we encounter their past experiences.\nHow Luffy became rubber and got his hat, how Zoro made a promise and became a 3 swordsman, how Nami came to hate pirates and love money, how Usopp became a lying orphan, how Sanji almost starved and became a chef, how Chopper lost his 'father' and became a doctor, how Robin lost everything and became a fugitive, how Franky became a shipwright and lost his mentor, how Brook 'lost' a friend and died. Every person can relate to one of these stories, some even relate to more than one. \nNot on a basis of what happened to the characters, for example hardly anyone is a shipwright or a swordsman, and no one who is reading this is dead (unless you're a ghost or something)\nIt's on a basis of what the characters felt. The pain of loss. The hardships of life.\nPeople who've lost a parent cried with Nami, Usopp, and Robin. People who lost a friend sobbed with Zoro and Brook. People who've starved ached with Sanji. People who've lost or hurt a loved one agonized with Luffy, Chopper, and Franky.\nAnd yet... they keep on smiling.\nThere is a quote from the series, it's made by Nami's 'mother', Bellemere.\n\"Always remember the strength to continue laughing.\"\nThat is another thing the series does which no other can do. It gives hope.\nSome of the quotes I've read/heard from this series have given me goosebumps from the power of the words they've contained.\n\"Always remember the strength to continue laughing.\" - Bellemere\n\"No one is born into this world to be alone!\" - Jaguar D.

No. When they drink a soup made from a poisonous mushroom!? No! It's when...they are forgotten.\"\n\nThese quotes... are ones to live by.\nWhether he knew it or not when he created this series.

It slowly reveal to you that being the pirate king isn't as easy as most people would think it is.\nArt :\nOh, it takes a while to get used to for some people. But for me, it didn't have to take even a second. Since I'm pretty much an artist myself and I accept pretty much alot of people's art-style. Oda's art is different, but every angle of the anatomy and background and details are very well put together. Alot of people would think it's childish, well, I think it's wonderful.\nCharacter :\nAH! The characters...! They are marvelous! I have no idea I can love all the characters so equally! Even Usopp! The guy I didn't really like in the beginning, is starting to grow on me! Their personalities are all so unique~ It's like people in real life, they are never the same~\nEnjoyment :\nOh! I enjoyed this manga ALOT. The humor, action, etc. are all so fun and awesome. I cannot describe how much entertainment I got from this manga~! I just WISH  that I could brainwash myself and watch One Piece all over again. >_<!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=59,   ["text"]="              \n    One Piece is an outstanding manga by perhaps the greatest mangaka in Japan right now, Eiichiro Oda.\nStory: 10/10\nWhen I first checked this thing out, the story seemed immature and poorly done, not to mention far too goofy. However I was soon corrected; it's none of the above. Luffy wants to be pirate king, but his main goal isn't that at all: It's to have as many adventures as he possibly can.\nThis is interesting, because unlike Naruto he does not wish to be the leader to get respect or anything silly like that. Luffy doesn't care about respect or appearances, which makes him a rather unique\n          \n        hero, even among shonen. Anyway, there are a series of shorter stories in the beginning as Luffy gathers friends (read: nakama). A swordsman, a navigator, a sharp-shooter/liar, and a chef join his crew in that order. \nAlthough others criticize him, he takes off for the grand-line with that 5-man crew of trusty but perhaps inadequate men (and woman). The grand-line is where most of the stories in One Piece actually take place.\nAfter that, a series of longer stories begin, each one with fresh and varying characters. Most have a very touching background, especially new crewmates.\nArt: 8/10\nAt first, the art may seem horrible to you, but that's only because you're used to things like Bleach and Naruto, which are much younger. As the series progresses (rather quickly) the art improves. \nNot much to say here.\nCharacter: 10/10\nHonestly, if I could give an 11/10 here, I would have. This is Oda's specialty, which is saying a lot, given his unnaturally great talent. Not just the main characters, but even minor ones (Dalton, Red Leg Zeff, Bellemere, et cetera) are given heartwarming backstories, personalities, and emotions.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nIt's quite enjoyable, from laughs to tears, to desperately rooting for a fight. As it keeps things fresh and interesting, you will even find yourself guessing at who the newest crewmate will be, who the main villain is, and what fruit who has.\nOverall: 10/10\nIn short, this can only be referred to as \"The Big Three\" with Naruto and Bleach because of length, and by no means quality. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=51,   ["text"]="               \n    It's said to be the greatest manga, all the elements you love in a series is all in the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece, left by a legendary pirate mangaka named Eiichiro Oda. Ever since 1997, the new era of manga began, competing to take the number one spot of Shonen Jump, so far, none has yet to step a foot in it's path. \nOnce I did, I asked myself why didn't I pick the series up earlier. I truly feel that this is the best Shonen series ever made if we were to review it objectively.\nAnyway, to the actual review:\nOne Piece initially\n          \n        feels very constantly slow-medium paced which feels just right because it's mostly an adventure manga, you NEED that many chapters to finish a story and write a main character's journey. Also, Oda does an awesome job of offering the massive world which a lot of series doesnt have that feel. The external environment has more development than character wise which also makes OP so much different from other shonens out there. One huge advantage One Piece has over every mangas out there is that the crew simply expands and expands as they travel to new unexplored lands and beyond the endless expanding universe. It really has an element of adventure, excitement and romance(to adventure) to it. It is very straightforward to see where arcs begin and end, because they go from island to island, yet it's completely unexpected. Wheras in something like Naruto, you don't get the sense of that also, also the main character(Luffy) wants to explore the WHOLE WORLD, not just a city or a town and it is needed because adventure is the biggest theme. One Piece is an adventure manga, that being said, something simple as exploring new place after places but they reach a segment and events change, flipped around and find something completely unexpected. Oda does a great job of keeping the audience interested. As we all know that the Strawhats will visit next island, like someone living their everyday life, adding age one after another. That is the basic gist that we will only know. It's completely unpredictable. Obviously you know what you want to do with your life and such but you wouldn't know every events leading up to that. It's simply a broad general idea of it. \nStory-wise, it's always filled with surprises. You can never predict what Oda has in store for you. This author/artist/pirate/god himself manages to incorporates various themes into some of the places in One Piece with preferences we are familiar with. For example, one of the city reminds you of Venice, Italy. Another reminds you of an Ancient civilization such as Mayans and Aztecs. There are some very powerful moments in One Piece that WILL break your heart. Even the humor is great, better than some of the American Cartoons itself which emphasizes on comedy. So far, One Piece has never disappointed me. I'm glad I gave this series a chance. \nCharacters are top-notch. No characters have been side-lined and left in the grave to rot like many other typical Shonen series does. There are too many lovable characters to talk about here but in every series, the main character is the most important so here we go! \nMonkey D. Luffy, a young man destined for great things. He never asked to not have a mother, he never asked to be born into a world which forces him to protect others from evil and corruption, and he never asked for any of his loved ones to be hurt. Luffy is humorous, innocent, strong-willed, brave, and most of all, life-loving. His persona rubs off on others, his ability to create joy and peace is astounding. His character's even developed so far as to make his readers weep alongside when he's emotionally broken. They are confused, rendered helpless when he feels helpless. When Kuma separated Luffy's crew, no reactions would be exaggerated. Luffy lost everything he loved, and it happened right in front of him. Luffy is a character that does not treats his nakamas as if they are utterly pathetic and helpless by saying he will protect them, no he is not... He is a man that leads by actions. This is the man that encourages his friends to get stronger for themselves and to protect their captain. Not just friends inspires, he inspires enemies to get stronger as well... That is because Luffy cannot go on a boring adventure become the Pirate King.\nThe art isn't really something to bash about. It's very unique compared to most generic well-drawn anime that is can be topped by even better detailed art. The art is simply perfect for a series like One Piece, I wouldn't have it drawn any other way.  One Piece lacks bi-shonen characters and rather opts for the wild and crazy character designs, the uniqueness and originality is top notch. Me personally, the wackier the better and having every characters look like they hopped out of Final Fantasy. The background very important in any manga and people usually overlooks this, they would rather read a series that is plagued with white backgrounds in panels over generically drawn characters. Oda's world is massive, colorful and very imaginative. Sometimes I think he goes way over-the-top but it really suits the nature of the series. \n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=23,   ["text"]="          \n    One Piece is widely considered to be among the most popular and highly rated anime/manga series of all time, and it takes no genius to figure out why. The premise is simple enough to follow, the character motivations are simple yet intertwined with one another and the setting is absolutely epic, with new locations always popping up and new adventures to be seen, both by the viewer/reader and characters alike. Couple that with a cast of eccentric characters and you get a recipe that's pretty damn easy to like...for most people.\nNot me though. Oh no no no, I wouldn't be here if that were all\n          \n        that One Piece was claimed to be good for.\nIn recent memory, One Piece has gained a reputation for being a shonen that for some reason manages to avoid the pitfalls of Naruto and Bleach; the story keeps moving forward at a steady pace, there is limited filler in both the anime and manga, the background art is gorgeous and there's a clear plan to move the series forward.\nWhat annoys me, however, is that people have gone so far as to compare it with shows that are clearly more competent, like Hunter X Hunter or FullMetal Alchemist. I'm here to provide you, dear reader, with evidence that that simply isn't true.\nStory-wise, One Piece isn't something to write home about. The premise is basic enough; main character wants to find the \"One Piece\", a treasure that all pirates aspire to find along a long and dangerous path filled with twists and turns known as the grand line. Along the way, he finds various comrades who have various goals of their own but end up supporting him and his goal.\nAnd this is where One Piece starts to fall apart. The first half of the manga plays along something along these lines:\n- Luffy (name of the main character, in case you don't know) and his crew travel to some mildly interesting/bizarre location.\n- They find *insert obviously new crew member*.\n- Luffy demands (without a shred of charisma or consideration to back it up) for them to join his crew.\n- The obviously new member ALWAYS says no. \n- Luffy discovers that obviously new party member's tragic past.\n- Luffy beats down *insert random bad guy here*, who is either the source of trouble for the obviously new party member or hurt someone dear to obviously new party member.\n- Luffy does something stupid that for some reason is reminiscent to something for obviously new party member which actually ends up working.\n- Obviously new party member says his farewell to the location, having made peace with everything and joins Luffy and his crew.\nThere are mild alterations to the formula (which you know would end up being the better arcs in the series), but generally, this is the formula One Piece follows.\nAnd guess what? It gets tiresome and irritating REALLY quickly. Everything comes off as over-dramatized, mundane and absolutely obnoxious.  Everything you heard about Luffy being funny is a massive lie with very few exceptions; he merely acts stupid or does stupid things, rants about how much he loves to eat meat and about how much he wants to protect his friends. There is no supermega complex character, he's not charming and he's ridiculously protected by plot armor.\nWith one exception, we also NEVER see Luffy train; he merely randomly pops up against the villain of the arc randomly screaming about \"I have this new move I've been practicing with\" and shows us said new move. That's literally it.\nThe other characters are basic and uninteresting; they hardly develop after their respective character arcs and their motivations are cast to the seas for no reason other than because of One Piece's other issue; subplots.\nOne Piece has a LOT of subplots, and all of them feel like they're turning in circles waiting for the inevitable final arc to resolve themselves. Sad thing is, many of these subplots had opportunities to resolve themselves which didn't happen, possibly because the writer realized that the audience would lose interest if certain subplots related to their favorite character(s) is resolved. Admittedly, this makes One Piece a giant timewaster that goes nowhere for so long; it's solution to that problem is adding even more subplots and even more characters that go nowhere but add excitement to the audience.\nWhere One Piece also fails is its miserable presentation that portrays almost everything that is with the Straw Hats (the pirates we follow) as good and everything that is against them as evil. Yes, I said \"almost\". Yes, there are exceptions. No, they do not alter the overall narrative.\nAnother issue? There's literally no way that One Piece will have a satisfying ending that pleases everyone. The treasure being found at the end would irritate a lot of people, the treasure not being found would irritate a lot of people, a twist that changes the nature of the story would also irritate a lot of people, and do you see where I'm going here?\nArtwork is fairly unusual but alright, and to its credit improves greatly as it goes. It's not my thing but I can definitely understand someone liking it. Backgrounds are gorgeous and very detailed, being immersive and interesting to look at.\nI'll be frank; there's next to nothing I like about this. I hate the story and how bloody inconsistent it is (certain arcs are great, making you think the story finally picks up...only to stall even longer), I hate how stale the characters are, I find the humor childish and repetitive, I dislike Luffy with a burning passion...you get the general idea.\nI do not like this series; if you do, fine, go on ahead, love it with all your heart. \nJust please acknowledge that not everyone shares that view.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=23,   ["text"]="          \n    Spoilers: I reveal the name of the crew members.\nOne Piece is the story of a boy named Monkey D. Luffy and on his journey to become the \"Pirate King\" and find the One Piece, which is the treasure left behind by Gol D. Rogers. \nLet me start out by saying I used to really like OP and was a big time fan, and as of the recent updates my passion for it has really declined over the years. \nPros: \n1) The setting - The world of OP is vast and filled with pretty much anything and everything possible. Fishmen, Mermaids, Giants, animal people, etc. Anyone\n          \n        with a sense of adventure can find some reason to like this world! \n2) Tackles a lot of real world issues - Slavery, politics, corrupt government, etc. All these things appear and play a large role in the overarching story. \n3) Haki is pretty interesting and I'm curious as to where it goes from here. \nNegatives:\n1) WAY WAY WAY too many characters - There are so many important characters to put up with, all with unique personalities, and powers that all play an important role in each arc. But the price for that is lack of screentime. A lot of characters get booted to the side and don't play a major role in the Arcs due to the large cast, the biggest example is one of the Strawhat members. He joined the crew in the final parts pre-timeskip and literally has had zero screen time after the skip. It's really disappointing seeing a lot potential go to waste. Even now, Oda continues to introduce more and more characters that continues to crowd out the old ones. While it's understandable that some more characters are necessary for story-reasons, the amount Oda has establish is completely unreasonable. For example, You have the straw hat crew, the navy, the pirate warlods, the Yonkos, the CP9 or whatever, the Supernovas and that's not even including their crews. This all moshed up with the required story characters really puts a hamper on the pace of the manga.\n2) It's going the Naruto route. Before the time-skip, it felt like everybody on the crew were actually there and played a large role in the stories. Now we only have Luffy, Zoro and Sanji are the only really useful people, while Robin and Nami are just there for fanservice, Tony-Tony Chopper who's just there for marketing reasons and occasionally do his job, Franky who's really just there to steer their ship, Ussop who is just comic relief, and Brook. Poor, poor Brook. Even among the 3 useful ones, 1 has been out of the picture until recently thus leaving Luffy and Zoro. Again, Oda is just wasting potential by not utilizing these characters\n3) Probably the one that I get the most hate for: Luffy is a really stale MC. Up until one specific arc, he literally is just the same as any other main character who fights for his dream and his friends with the only difference being that he doesn't really care about other's opinions. After the mentioned arc and he experiences the reality of the world, what does he do? Nothing. He literally does not change or develop. This really angers me as I feel Luffy doesn't develop as a character. We feel a better connection with the character when we see them struggle and overcome obstacles and then grow as a person. Which is why Zoro is the best written character in OP. He actually feels like a human for what it's worth while Luffy feels completely unrealistic. Especially his reaction in the Dressrosa arc when a certain character is introduced and he has the worst reaction ever. I would like to mention that there is one instance where I give props to Luffy for overcoming an obstacle and it's his \"bloody\" fight.\nFinal thoughts: OP is mediocre at best. It only has a few good moments that really stand out from the rest but the rest is just pretty eh. If you're into the pure essence of an epic adventure then I'd totally recommend One Piece to you, but if you're looking for more than there's plenty of better options out there. \n        "},

It's slow at first but truly becomes greater and greater and adds to plot that keeps you on end. It doesn't repeat itself, doesn't bore you, & doesn't leave you not craving more. It has cracked me up, moved to uncontrollable tears, and made a reason to have a true obsession.\nCHARACTER: \nOne Piece shines the greatest in this aspect. All the characters are well-developed & lovable. Even supporting characters are extremely well developed and become an integrated part of the story. When I say One Piece would be nothing without it's characters, I mean it. The crew itself makes One Piece all the more enjoyable for me.\nART: \nThis turns SO many people away from this wonderful series. For the longest time, I was the victim of this 'judge-an-manga-by-its-art' disease. (That was an Usopp reference btw.) I hated it. It was ugly to me and I stayed far from it. The art improves gradually. Oda's style from the start to end is quite a difference, but its still the same but I honestly adore it and would want it no other way.\nOVERALL:\nWhen I decided to first started One Piece, which I watched the entire anime first and still watch it, I was like, \"Hey, I think i'll watch this, it looks okay.\" Little did I know I had started what would become my favorite series ever. Call One Piece overrated, stupid, plotless, etc. Read it. I PROMISE you, you'll definitely change you mind. C:\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=31,   ["text"]="          \n    One of the most popular manga out there, one piece is definitely a piece of wonder. Sure, it has a few faults, but are they enough to to bash it? I'm not so sure I'll explain why.\nSTORY=8\nIts story is quite simple, a boy named Monkey D Luffy wants to become the pirate king, and he goes on a journey seeking adventure and new crew members. It's not definitely bad, but people are now criticizing its 'repeated' story arcs. They reach a new island, see its culture etc. and then find out that this island is not as peaceful as it seems to be as the\n          \n        are ruled by a dictator like antagonist, the crew gets split and in the end the enemy ends up with a beaten up face. BUT, heres my problem, aren't there many mangas that have repeated story lines? (even though they are not shonen, en example of diamond dust and Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso will be an elaborate one) It does not matter that the story is repeated one, what matters is its execution, of which one piece is a master. The arcs are different in every aspect except for their basic plot.\nAnother problem is that people are saying that one piece post-time-skip is of lower quality, is strongly disagree with this statement. One piece has always been a manga that has gone up and down for me. I loved Alabasta and Jaya arc, hated skypiea, liked enis lobby arc, disliked Thriller bark, and was blown away by marineford and dressrosa arcs. So no one can say that it is worse then before. And one needs to remember that Oda is building up the second part for another big war. Just like before the time skip. I'm quite sure that it will be better the marinefore. So patience is virtue.\nCHARACTERS=9\nOda uses his ultimate move to bring color to his characters, flashback, a move very few people pay heed to. It gives great depth to his characters and ,to be honest, I was moved to tears by Nami's and Robin's as well as Luffy's flashback. And through these flashbacks, secondary characters are also brought to life. \nOne piece has its fair share of characters that people love and hate.And most of them are diverse in their characters. The most unusual of the pack are made Straw-hat's cre members. I mostly enjoy Luffy's nakama's personalities ( with honorary mention to Robin's , Chopper, Sanji, Usopp, and Luffy ). And then there are people like Enel and Spandam as well that I absouletl despise. Even Blackbeard is an interesting character.\nART=8\nOne of the many reasons why one piece has not reached world domination is because a lot of people are swayed from reading it due to it's art, which they have termed as 'childish'. I have seen other mangakas draw Sanji, and to be honest, I really do not think that they will give me the same feel to the manga. Deal with it, this art is perfert for one piece. \nENJOYMENT=9 \nIt is the type of manga where it will be more fun and emotional if you read at least 5 chapters together, other wise the pace will kill you. It is one hell of a good read, lets hope that it does not become retarded like it's brothers. (Naruto and Bleach) \nOVERALL=8\nIt can be frustrating at times but I'm quite sure that it will always keep you interested.\n        "},

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="          \n    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS UP TO CHAPTER 817\nI felt inclined to write this review because I used to love this series a lot more in high school, still follow it, and feel like I know a lot about this series (I used to go on forums dedicated to OP and have reread the series once or twice and some arcs more times). I know a lot of fervent fans of this series and see a lot more online. I also see a lot polarized extreme opinions (of the first 7 reviews on the OP page, they're either 10s or 1s with no happy middles) and\n          \n        hoped to give my thoughts on it. Should it be read? Is it worth reading? \nI would say for the most part, this is a series worth reading for most shonen fans and if you want a semi interesting adventure story. But as with all long running shows, there will be many high points and low points. I would say my favorite moments in this show would probably get 10s but my most annoyed moments with it would get 1s or 2s. I cant go into each arc so Ill describe in general some positives and negatives with each review category below.\nStory\nThe plot of One Piece follows Luffy as he dreams of becoming the Pirate King and sets out on a journey to do so. Along the way, he meets crewmates (\"nakama\" as he would call them) and fights many foes.\nI personally found most of the beginning arcs and Part 1 in general more enjoyable than the Part 2 Ive seen up until this point. The story introduced the enemies at a decent pace early on, showed some struggle or semi entertaining fights, and there were some pretty epic or cool moments. Off the top of my head, I recall Luffy's battle with Don Krieg where he punched through Krieg's spiked armor to do damage. Against Arlong, most of his attacks didnt faze Arlong's durable body, so he had to use a much stronger attack to do so. \nLots of little introductions and the buildup of future opponents was decently interesting. For example, Jimbei was mentioned early on, and Mihawk was introduced early as a goal for Zoro. The conflict of pirates vs Marines and the World Govenment was interesting too. Lots of subplots made this series very entertaining as tiny details would come back later, such as Robin's history and ability to read polyglyphs.\nNow the issues with the story. First off, Oda, the writer, has in my opinion very poor pacing ability in many of the arcs. Part of this is his desire to \"line up\" his chapter numbers evenly. Did you notice how chapter 100 is the chapter Luffy and crew enter the grand line? Its pretty cool...but the author skipped an entire enemy who he originally planned in the prior arc just to make that happen (this character was later shown in the anime but even still, he shouldnt be rushing and slowing down his manga for this).\nNext, he constantly feels the need to slap on a damsel in distress or people in distress just about every major arc. Arlong arc? Lets save Nami. Alabasta arc? Lets save Vivi. Enies Lobby arc? Lets save Robin. Dressrosa arc? Lets save Rebecca. And when there isnt a damsel in distress, its a very convenient people in distress. For example, right when Lufy came to Skypiea was right when the arc villain Enel conveniently decided to start to destroy the area and kill all the people. Same for Dressrosa.\nThis \"convenience\" of One Piece is a big issue I have with it, alongside its \"powerlevels\" which feel very off and weird. For example, in Water 7, Luffy had a great deal of trouble dealing with Franky and Paulie. These two were later shown to be roughly on par or weaker than Blueno. Luffy would go on to fight Blueno and have a relatively solid win. But it doesnt stop there - he proceeds to fight Rob Lucci, who's power level is explicitly stated by the characters to be 5 times that of Blueno's, and Luffy still fights him evenly. This is just one example of many. In Thriller Bark, Luffy has 100 shadows powering him up and defeats Oars with increased speed and strength. But when Moria puts on 1000 shadows, only his strength is increased and a shadowless Luffy beats him. Later in the war, Luffy stands up against Mihawk and the three admirals (who are among the strongest in the world) and he survives their attacks when they are trying to kill him. This makes no sense as their power should eclipse Luffy by several levels.\nThis liberal usage of fighting powers would be fine in most other shows, but for a battle shonen, I would like more reasonable power levels and battles and not just have the author's willy nilly choices. On a side note, there are also power ups that annoy me, pulled out of nowhere (for example, Zoro and Sanji spend a completely even battle with Kaku and Jyabura before revealing they've had powerups the whole time and then beating their enemies in two hits with relative ease. They never showed these power ups prior either).\nNext, as far as convenience, the Strawhats tend to have a lot just handed to them. Their ship is breaking down? Good thing the very next island is the greatest ship building island in the world. Just enter the grand line? Heres a princess and conspiracy plot to solve and become famous for immediately. No need to search for enemies. Then theres other ridiculous things like the recent alliance of crews. Luffy takes no initiative at all in rounding up allies. Dozens of pirate crews simply ask him to become their alliance leader and form a pack with him. Everything just happens because he and his crew happened to fall into it.\nAnyway, those are my complaints about the story. There are still some nice arcs. I particularly liked Alabasta's overall structure and almost all the individual battles. I liked Luffy failing twice against Crocodile, Zoro being pushed to his limit, and especially Usopp's clever victory method. I also enjoyed Water 7 and Enies Lobby for being the most emotional arc as Usopp decided to leave the crew and members started to go missing. Only for an exciting climax at Enies Lobby. Then I enjoyed Impel Down for being an interesting twist on the prison arc where Luffy teamed up with old enemies to break out of prison, and I liked Marineford for its scale of epicness and grandure. I even liked the beginning arcs, such as Loguetown and lots of other things.\nBut overall, the bad leaves a sour aftertaste even with all the good.\nArt\nMost people seem to dislike OP art initially and I agree it looks weird. But I do enojy the zany designs and most of the backdrops and settings were well detailed. Id say the art is overall good. Its intentionally goofy, and I do enjoy that. I can tell what characters are doing in scenes too.\nCharacter\nOkay, this is probably gonna piss off a lot of rabid fanboys. I think the main cast is bloated, lots of side characters are one dimensional with a single goofy trait to distinguish them, and Oda does flashbacks in a very poor, slow fashion to try to elicit feelings but it doesnt work so well, at least for me.\nTo elaborate, the main cast of the Strawhats begins to feel especially shallow when Franky and Brooke join. At this point, theres so many characters, Oda trips over his own feet trying to write them that they dont get enough development or time to shine. This is exacerbated when he tries to elicit feelings in Saobody with Franky and Brooke's disappearance at Kuma's hands - does the author honestly expect us to feel the same connection to these two arc old allies compared to Zoro or Nami who have been with Luffy since the beginning? Later in Dressrosa, Oda has to divide the crew suddenly so its easier to write the arc (though he wastes this spare time on the princess Rebecca's sob story and the plight of the dwarves), but he still off panels important things like Franky's confrontation with the vice admiral and marines.\nOn side characters being one dimensional, a lot of the characters in the show are comedic but some are serious. The problem is the serious ones still tend to not be much more than caricatures or just stereotypes. Even the main character Luffy, after 800 chapters, is dense as a brick and still makes the same mistakes (something pointed out by Zoro when Luffy lost to Caesar when he spent two year training and is in reality a different league than Caesar). Characters like Rebecca are rehashes of Vivi arcs ago, characters like Brooke and Chopper are only used for one off gags and rarely have their own dedicated scenes. Lots of exposition is used on characters and situations that should be faster and simpler to try to give depth, but it turns into an infodump or just a poor attempt at a sob story.\nNow that all said, I still enjoy a lot of characters from an \"epic\" point of view. Lots of characters like Akainu and Whitebeard have cool scenes or cool speeches, and thats pretty entertaining. And lots of characters are funny, though the gags get old soon enough. \nThe issue is theres no depth and very little growth. Characters stay mostly stagnant and regress after most development scenes to their standard gags. For example, Usopp says that after two years, he has become stronger, but he continues to be scared of enemies and monsters that the crew fights. Luffy promised before the training time skip to become strong enough that he wouldnt lose any of his crewmates. What happens two arcs in? He messes around in a fight and gets half his crew captured.\nTheres lot of other little nitpicks and issues but I wont dwell on them all. There are issues with things like Color of Observation haki never being used by characters, characters not killing others and always letting others go (for no reason other than to have the plot stay goody-goody), and some other nitpicks, but thats enough for now.\nOverall, I'd say characters in One Piece are fairly shallow and people ought to read more for the plot than the characters.\nEnjoyment\nWell, I'd say this long adventure story is very enjoyable when its good, but very annoying when its bad. It has lots of ups and downs, and I strongly disagree its the 10 Masterpiece so many fans and friends I know rate it as. I just wanted to give my review on my issues and things I see as flaws. I think its a worthwhile read for passing the time, and its an entertaining and enjoyable story mostly.\nOverall:\nHeres my ratings arc by arc (may have missed some small things but whatever):\nEast Blue: 7\nAlabasta: 8\nJaya: 5\nSkypiea: 7\nDavy Back: 5\nWater 7 and Enies Lobby: 9\nPost Enies Lobby: 5\nThriller Bark: 6\nSaobody: 7\nAmazon Lily: 6\nImpel Down: 9\nMarineford: 8.5\nPost Marineford and Luffy flashback: 2 (Luffy's flashback was drawn out and unentertaining)\nFishman Island: 4\nPunk Hazard: 5\nDressrosa: 4\nZoa: 5\nAs you can see, I particularly think the story has been worse since the time skip.\nStory overall: 6.03 when averaged out. It doesnt correct for the chapter length differences but its approximately how I feel toward the series's story. There is a bonus from the overarching flow gained, but its wrecked by pacing and other issues that it mostly cancels out. This would be 6.5 or so at most if I were generous but the pacing, rushed nature, lots of forgotten or badly timed plots, and conveniences toward the main character are minuses that keep this low.\nArt overall: 7 (its solid and works for what its intended to do but its not a masterpiece or anything even close)\nCharacter: 3.5 (either bad or very bad for the reasons explained. This isnt a show about characters or character development imo, its a battle shonen adventure and it shines through that. The characters can be enjoyable, but they can also be very irksome and shallow, will round up to 4 to give the series I once loved the benefit of the doubt)\nEnjoyment: 6.5 (good overall on some levels but definitely has a lot of flaws as I pointed out above. And this is with me leaving out a lot of other flaws and irritations I have with the series. Of course, I've probably left out some good points too, so Ill round this to 7 for the final scoring)\nOverall: 6 entertaining work and enjoyable adventure shonen but lots of flaws and not the masterpiece that so many others love to claim that it is. My review of course did not encompass all the critical elements of OP, but I touched on I think just about every major point I have in regards to it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="          \n    I think I gave it a fair run, I got deep in the Skypiea arc but I just stopped caring so had to drop it. It's a shame because it did have moments where it intrigued me like the whole seven pirate gods and world government but the Straw Hats get distracted and go off on these side adventures and they sometimes last hundreds of pages.\nThe majority of the arcs have the same structure where Luffy goes to a new town or island, beats up the local villain and moves on. A couple of arcs did this differently and were the better ones but it\n          \n        just wasn't enough, repetitive stop-starts kept killing momentum before it could build up. \nDon't expect a HunterXHunter where it switches the genre and tone in each arc because it doesn't happen, not in the first 250 chapters anyway and everything blurs together, the exception being the Alabastor arc which had a different setting, structure and the only intimidating villain at that point in the story.\nThe characters have cool designs and I did grow attached to them but they were way too overpowered and got out of scuffles far too easily without any losses. I don't think a single named character died so it was hard to feel any tension during fight scenes because I knew everything would turn out just fine.\nFor me One Piece is a manga that had a promising setting and premise but it never gets fully capitalised on. A shame because it's loved by so many others, I think it could have been much better if the mangaka didn't drag the story out so much and took more risks in his story telling rather than taking the safe options. \n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=21,   ["text"]="            \n    One piece has gathered a lot of hype in the last few years, and i have heard many sceptical views of its rising popularity. But regardless of your view, the sheer number of manga being sold suggest that there is something which differentiates this series from others. Personally, I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this series, regardless of my general dislike of shounen manga.\nStory: at the start of the series, the storyline is quite basic and a little cliche. There is the main character who gathers friends and sets off on an adventure, fighting a series of bad guys along the way. While the story is\n          \n        still exciting and enjoyable, it is understandable why many drop this series after reading the first 100 chapters or so, as it is almost underwhelming in the scheme of things. Oda also writes very long winded stories which may seem to drag on a little. However, if you power through, the plot which Oda has woven gains complexity and depth and somehow manages to move away from the typical shounen manga cliches. Each arc still has the typical structure of the main characters overcoming a group of enemies, but is far from typical in the originality of the world Oda has created and the underlying plot which strings each story together. One piece is not just about epic adventures, becoming stronger and battling pirates, but is centered around the key themes of friendship and dreams, ideas which are displayed liberally throughout the series. \noverall, the story is one big epic adventure, an emotional roller coaster riddled with delightful humor, friendship, quirky characters, action and a surprising amount of depth.\nArt: Oda's style is not something I would normally like at all, and it can be described as an acquired taste. Personally, I am usually guilty of picking manga by the style of art rather than story. Despite this, I have come to genuinely enjoy the art of One piece. If you like the style, great. If it is not you cup of tea, as you read, the story and characters will make up for the drawings. I think it would be a shame to miss out on this series because of the 'unusual' art style. Once I had started reading I found that I began to view the art as delightfully quirky and perfectly fitting for the story.\nCharacter: My favorite part on one piece would have to be the characters. The nine main characters are intensely diverse and quirky, yet somehow manage to fit together and compliment each other. Each has a very strong personality and unique past, designed in detail down to their habits and ticks. Their crew is odd to say the least, but the three dimensional characters and the dynamics between them make one piece stand out as a quality piece of work.\nIn addition to the main characters, each and every enemy or subcharacter is almost equally quirky and unique. Every character of this series is odd and three dimensional, adding to the humor, quality and general feel of one piece. Character design is one of Oda's strong points.\nEnjoyment: One piece is a series which can be enjoyed by anyone. Oda has created a world of pirates which is very unique and highly entertaining. The characters are spectacular, the story exciting and action packed and the message one of chasing dreams and true friendship. The entire series is wonderfully hilarious, riddled with just enough humor unique to one piece. It is a series that will make you smile, laugh, tense and cry, while taking you on an epic adventure.\nOverall, one piece is a very good series once you get into it. It is well balanced for most of the part, though some parts are a little long. It is my favorite manga, even though i don't like shounen manga. (chapter 450/500 onwards is so good!)\nThe most unfortunate thing about this series is that so much is lost when it is translated. Oda portrays characters largely through dialogue, almost all of which is lost in translation. The language and its nuance is so vital to characters and story and it is almost depressing how little makes it into the translated versions. Most unfortunate is the loss of the humor. While still funny in english, Oda's humor does not translate well at all. The uniquely Japanese humor, the style of boke and tsukkomi, nuances and tempo can not really be translated or sometimes appreciated in english. Having tried to read it in english, I gave up very quickly. It is a shame if you can not read Japanese or do not know the culture very well because a ridiculous amount is lost in translation. One piece really is 10000000X better in Japanese\n        "},

It has been going strong for over a decade now and seems to be only hitting its peak. As shonen manga goes, One Piece far and beyond surpasses the likes of similar titles such as Bleach and Nauto in my personal opinion, and it mostly has to do with the characters. \nOne Piece has some of the best characters in a manga. Each of them gets a heartfelt and tragic story arc in which we get to see their past and the tragedy that of them had to go through.\n          \n        But we get to see how those hardships in the past made them to who they are currently.

Known for its absolutely crazy fans and forums, people often chalk One Piece up to be all hype and no substance. I know people who didn't want to try it because the artwork didn't appeal to them or they didn't want to go through the 300+ chapters that it would take to catch up. Most of the people who were initially hesitant to read One Piece fell in love with it right at the second major arc. \nOf the 'Big Three,' One Piece was the last I started with and I wish that I had started it earlier. Ridiculously\n          \n        awesome characters, tear-jerking moments, comedy that actually makes me laugh, and Luffy. Oh, Luffy. In One Piece, very few characters are treated as wastes. Oda is very detailed when it comes to setting up a new character. It's hard to forget even the most minor of villains. And it's definitely the type of manga that sends chills all over your body. When you see a character make an epic return, when you hear the background stories of the nakama or whoever, when you watch battle being fought (often intelligently). Oda's chapters feel as if there's a purpose to everyone. The most minute of detail can easily become something big. And as Oda and his audience matured, the themes and events in One Piece did, as well. It's a manga for all ages, no doubt. \nI can probably wax poetic for quite sometime regarding the sheer greatness of this manga, but I won't. Please give the manga a chance. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=18,   ["text"]="            \n    One Piece is a beautiful, beautiful manga; however, many people overlook it because it stands in the \"Big Three\" manga, which are highly criticized.\nI admit, I did NOT like One Piece at first, and it bored me to tears at points. That was about 4 years ago, when I still did not have a full grasp on the struggles life had to offer me. I resumed OP around 2 months ago, and I saw it in a very different light.\nWhat I saw once as a silly pirate story became a ongoing, complex story about finding one's passion, friendship (or in this case, \"Nakama\"), adventure, and\n          \n        overall, growing up (this is especially evident in the later chapters).\nStory (10/10):\nYou might not see it this way if you are still young, or rather, in the \"I-don't-know-where-I-belong age group\" (around 12-14). If young enough, this is an comical adventure story. If old enough, the plotline is amazing and the characters -- just right. I started OP when I was 12, but only after 3 years in high school did I notice the similarities in the challenges faced in this manga and real life. Whether it be a quest for an \"impossible\" dream or just pure acceptance, One Piece touched many edgy topics in a way that was both serious and comical.\nArt (8/10):\nThe art is simple and unique when it comes to characters, but the background is GORGEOUS. So gorgeous that it draws away sometimes from the actual action. For example, if two characters were fighting in a room, the detailed curtain drapes might confuse you. But, overall, the feeling is not lost. The characters' features were hard to get used to at first, but then I realized Oda was a genius for making them this way: the features were perfect for both extremes of the emotional spectrum. Comical because they were flexible (especially Luffy, ha) and stoic because they were firm. One flaw I see, though, is the women are anatomically disproportionate, even for manga, being incredibly skinny with huge breasts. Huge.\nCharacter (10/10):\nOh my goodness, this makes up the whole show. No joke. With each addition to Luffy's crew, you feel a certain connection, all because of two major points: bizarre characteristics and awesome background stories. My goodness, the BACKGROUND STORIES. I wish I could tell you more without spoiling, but I can't! They're just beautiful! However, characteristics you may see that no other character possess are Zoro's complete (COMPLETE, COMPLETE) lack of direction (COMPLETE), Chopper's insulting gratitude, and much much more.\nEnjoyment (9/10):\nOne Piece keeps you on your toes because you don't know what's going to happen next. Of course, an adventure, but where? These places are not for ordinary people with ordinary actions. The rest of the enjoyment comes from many of the qualities above (character, especially).\nOverall (9/10):\nI love this manga so much. So much. It makes me feel better when I'm down, and laugh even through the saddest times. It makes me cry with the characters and yell at the pages sometimes. Just don't judge it by its first few chapters, because it WILL get better and mature along with you.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="              \n    I think we’re all familiar with what a fantastic adventure epic that One Piece is. Oda has created a world that is so brilliantly imaginative and exciting that I can almost confidently say that no other mangaka will come close to matching or surpassing what he has done. One Piece will make you laugh, cry, smile along with all the characters; it will make you feel like living in their world. I won’t review the plot or the battles and such, since that has already been comprehensively well-done by other reviewers, but I just wanted to share one aspect of One Piece that will always\n          \n        stay very close to my heart.\nNo other manga has given me as much joy as One Piece. During the time I read it, I was very happy. This manga is special because it reminds us of some very important things in life. It reminds us to follow your dreams no matter how hard it seems and what other people say, to stand up for what you believe in and most of all; it reminds us of the power of friendship and human kindness. I think these are all things we tend to give up on and stop believing in as we get older. \nOne of the messages that had a huge impact on me was that ‘No-one is born into this world to be alone’. No matter how lonely you feel, you have to hold on to life and hang in there for people who will love and accept you. You might not meet them now, but you will eventually. I’ve never had many friends, and only formed a few close relationships with people. I’ve never found anyone whom I can call a true friend. For people like me, this message is very powerful and can lend a lot of strength. I think it is wonderful that a manga can convey these kinds of pure, hopeful feelings.  \nAnd that is one of the amazing things, perhaps even the most amazing thing, about One Piece. It gives you a sense of real, genuine joy as you read it. It really touches your heart. That is why it has managed to captivate thousands, millions of readers around the world, and why it will continue to be one of my most favourite mangas ever.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="            \n    Now the best selling manga of all time, One Piece is the tale of a man named Luffy who is gonna become king of the pirates. In face of this long-running manga, that summary does many injustices; in essence, One Piece is a story of the Strawhat Pirates setting out to follow their dreams. This overview is going to be a bit long, but hang tight with me and I'll give you as much of an comprehensive overview as I can on this monster of a series.\nMy criticisms of the manga are as follows: as the manga goes on, the skinnier women get less and\n          \n        less room to have organs while their breasts seem to increase in mass. It's not as if the author, Oda Eiichiro, is incapable of diversity, either. Oda has shown to take risks when drawing male characters, giving them a wider choice of physical design. There is also the problem with white-washing, which is much more obvious in the anime than the manga, but present nonetheless.\nOn the other hand of the spectrum, what One Piece does good, it does REALLY GOOD. There are many fine details of plot and characters that are continuously woven into the story; a little \"throw-away\" character to help start the manga series you don't think you'll ever see again? JUST KIDDING, they're back and they're doing stuff! Oda does not forget his characters, unlike some authors (looking at you, Kubo Tite). Speaking of characters, there are MANY, of many different moralities, aspirations, and identities. I've seen some people complain that there are too many characters in One Piece, but I feel that it is justified as: 1) the characters are traveling from island to island, and it makes sense to meet more people and 2) this large cast is HANDLED WELL. Unlike in other series such as Bleach or Dragon Ball where the notable characters are so large in number that sometimes their own authors forget their names, One Piece is able to establish characters well and balance the ones that will appear again and those that shall not.\nOne of the best parts of One Piece, however, is its sincerity. One of the reasons I can not bother myself with series like Fairy Tail is because many of its preachings ring hollow, almost out of obligation. Even as it embodies many shounen tropes, One Piece doesn't feel like it is shoving token lessons down my throat. Perhaps it's because the main characters are not totally \"goody two-shoes\"; they aren't going to save the world because \"that's what you should do\", they do things because \"they want to\". Sometimes that means beating up a whole town of bounty hunters and stealing their stuff, sometimes that means saving a group of children from a mad scientist--even if it is disadvantageous to them and they will get nothing out of it. \nOne Piece, with all it's flaws and perfections, is  a lot of fun. Interwoven with a clear sense of adventure and mystery; lessons of strong friendship, love, and following your dreams; as well as very real discussions of politics and corruption, racism and other forms of discrimination, the nature of revenge, and even slavery! This is a big series with many aspects, and though long, it is worth every chapter.\nIf you like creative and fantastical worlds, elements of whimsy as well as an shounen spark of adventure, One Piece has much to offer you.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="              \n    How do I love thee? Let me count the ways\nThis series is where it all began for me. The \"Romance Dawn\" if you will. I remember starting the fifth grade back in 2007, I hit it off real quickly with this one boy in my class. We had loads of things in common and were constantly sharing new interests. One thing we didn't share was his love anime and manga. This wasn't because I didn't like it, rather I just hadn't experienced it yet. One day he shoved One Piece volumes 1-3 in my backpack and told that I would love it. And love it\n          \n        I did. I read through all 13 novels available at the time in a flash. I read and re-read them while I waited for the next to be released. In me grew a love for manga and anime of all sorts, it was like junk food (I feel like many of you would agree). Incidentally, One Piece was, and still is, my favorite manga of all-time. \nBut enough about me, on to the actual review! I promise that this will be a completely objective review. I think I will start with what is great about this manga, as it vastly outweighs it's flaws.\nThe most important part of any story is, well, the story! One piece tells a grand tale of adventuring pirates all searching for the ultimate treasure. In a story like this, the world is absolutely massive, and Eiichiro Oda handles it so well. Every new place our characters travel they are faced with trials and tribulations. Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose. You never know. Each story arc is unique in setting and character development. There are new problems to solve or maybe another pirate warlord to defeat. Either way it feels pretty fresh every time. And it is all very memorable, I can’t think of a single time I felt that a chapter was just filler-garbage.\nAt the core of the story is its wonderful characters. All of them have their quirks, but they are not defined by these, which unfortunately happens very often in manga. This makes them feel very real. For example, the main character, Monkey D. Luffy, at face value, seems to be just a lovable idiot. But underneath this is a shocking deep, passionate person who looks out for his friends at all costs. For Luffy there are no truly sad goodbyes, everyone has a purpose and a plan so as their friend, he lets them go. The characters are what I love the most I think, you can connect with them so closely on different levels and they never get boring.\nBut even with a good plot and characters, what is a story if it is not enjoyable? One Piece is a fun and ofttimes, absolutely insane story. It can leave you in stitches or it will make sob like a baby. It is a well-crafted roller coaster of emotions and plots. No matter how old you are, no matter what kind of manga you like, you WILL enjoy One Piece.\nNow to the bad. There is not much about One Piece that is truly bad, but nothing is without flaws. I feel like my points are nitpicky things that don’t really hurt the story.\nThe artwork in One Piece is normally really great. It is generally clean and simple. But occasionally the fighting scenes can get very messy and it can be a bit difficult to tell what is going on. Also worth noting, there is a lot of visual humor and the mouths especially can get very crazy looking, I can see where this would put some people off. It put me off until I got used to it. \nThe story can sometimes feel a little repetitive. But I feel this is very understandable, last I heard, this story is meant to take up 100 novels (if you bought the whole series new it would cost you around $1300!) so this inevitable. Although, Oda does a really great job of spacing out the similar story lines, so this is not incredibly noticeable. \nOverall, One Piece is a great story and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great series! \n\nAlso worth noting: the anime follows the manga series pretty perfectly, so if you are more a watcher than a reader, you will miss out on almost nothing."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=15,   ["text"]="            \n    Leader of the big three in Japan.  Categorized as consistently getting better with every story arc that passes.  Praised for its unique art style which is called both grotesque and absurdly appropriate.  \nKnow this, its a fantastic manga.  80-90% of the people who don't read it are people who were influenced badly by the art or the horrible 4kids dub which destroyed its image or just had trouble getting past the slow beginning.  But people who truly don't like the series aren't that common.  \nDon't judge this one quickly whatever you do.  Read 100 or even 200 chapters\n          \n        before giving up on it.  Most people start liking it after the Arlong park arc, and then completely fall in love with it after the Enies lobby arc.  \nSynopsis: The story is about Monkey D Luffy and his quest to become King of the Pirates by travelling the Grand Line and finding the legendary treasure known as One Piece.   \nStory: 9/10\nPre-grand line the story isn't really that much and was all just character development.  Some very heartfelt and beautiful flashbacks to each of the crew members pasts.  They had some horrible incident happen in their lives which made them outcasts, but Luffy recognizes there strength and gets them to join his crew.  \nWhen they enter the grand line its still mainly about developing new characters, but Oda starts to tie the world together a little bit.  The existence of the forbidden pone-glyphs, the corrupt officials in the world government.  All this starts to tie itself together in the grand line.  \nThe story itself is also a real tear jerker.  I get lumps in my throat all the time listening to them.  Keeping in mind that I am an emotional robot so you will probably end up grabbing a Kleenex.  \npower-ups I would say are done somewhat poorly.  At least the first wave of power-ups during the Enies lobby arc.  I would say they are 5/5 for \"cool power-ups\" and 1/5 for well thought out power-ups.  Oda just had them evolve out of nowhere without any foreshadowing.  The next power-ups though were absolutely perfect.  After the time skip, they had basically been foreshadowing the abilities and changes to the crew for the duration of the manga.  Absolutely perfectly done.  \nAnother thing I have been noticing about the story.  Oda is actually building towards a sequel.  He's left all these hints talking about things the pirate king did and they never go into much detail but Oda leaves it open to be elaborated on in a second one piece manga.  Its rather epic and grand when I think about it.  That he's already putting together a sequel about the original pirate king.  \nArt: 10/10\nOriginal art style designed specifically to work with the pirate theme.  This turns a lot of people off, but you can't possibly claim that Oda is actually bad at drawing.  Looking closely at the pictures there is so much detail in every frame that you can't think that way.  Oda is the Picasso of pirate manga.  \nwonderfully detailed backgrounds.  Every frame has them.  Lots of manga write off backgrounds and just focus on stunning characters, but one piece gives you both.  The backgrounds are simply amazing.  \nCharacter Art is off the charts.  Every character has his own style too him. All of them are completely original and unique.  Even the filler characters look good.  One tiny flaw is that usually the female characters are somewhat bland in that they are all knockout babes, but I don't think Oda had much of a choice there given the market, and to be honest he does sneak a lot of ugly females in the back door on occasion.  \nCharacter 10/10\nCharacter development is pretty much covered in story and is fantastic.  They introduce a character and give them a back-story and continue developing them throughout the series.  For instance, Nami's would be weather or not she can overcome what the fishmen did to her village.  They never drag the story of one character on either.  It's rather elegant.  \nEnjoyment 9/10\nThe early story was rather poorly done in comparison with the ladder of the story and you can see the mangaka improves with every chapter.  So its hard to get into and like I said before 80-90% of people who haven't read One Piece is because they gave up early on without giving it a chance to improve.  IT GETS BETTER!!!!\nThe action is more of a brawl then a strategy game which is a matter of taste really.  Its actually rather easy for Oda not to screw up given the way he's done it.  \nComedy is definitely there.  Every character has their own quirks which never get old.  At first glance they might seem like catchphrases but they are actually much deeper than that.  They each have their own funny personality and quirks which play into how they interact with each other.  \nOverall 9/10\nThere's really no good way to score One Piece because early on they would rank probably a 7/10 or an 8/10 depending on how much the show suited your tastes, but with the show getting better every season its basically jumped a point every year.  By now if I was to judge it just by the last year, I would give it a 15/10...  IT GOT FRIGGEN GOOD!!!!\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="           \n    Review One Piece (East Blue Saga)\nThis will probably be my last attempt to make a review on this particular series, as still being an ongoing manga. And thus, shall we begin?\nThe anime adaptation done by Toei Animation is probably the cringiest thing ever done since trendings, which you know, is something too dumb to exist. The manga though is something too good to be true, especially the beginning which I will be talking about in this review.  \nThe manga of \"One Piece\" begins with Gold D. Roger (King of the Pirates) about to be executed. At that moment, he shouts to the crowd that\n          \n        his treasure is exactly where he left it but that to find it, one must search the whole world. This sparked the Golden Age of Pirates in which countless pirates raise their flags and set off to find One Piece.\nEast Blue is the introductory saga of the series, this is when Monkey D. Luffy meets Shanks as a young boy living in East Blue and where Luffy recruits most of his crew, which, ultimately, is where the adventure begins. Also, this saga is made up of six story arcs, which are Romance Dawn, Orange Town, Syrup Village, Baratie, Arlong Park and Loguetown which leads to Reverse Mountain, Whiskey Peak, and Drum Island.\nThe East Blue Saga focuses mainly on Luffy setting off for the \"Grand Line\" and gathering crewmates. During the saga, Luffy gains four comrades: Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji and earns a bounty of 30,000,000 berries. The first crewmate is Zoro, a brutal swordsman that was being held captive by the son of a maritime chief, Helmeppo. Then, the second crewmate is officially Usopp since Nami used Luffy for her own purpose. Usopp is a boy that is always causing chaos telling lies to the people of the village. He has three boy friends who follow him on their adventures of making lies, making Usopp a real \"pirate.\" In the city of Syrup, there is a girl named Kaya who is a young girl who lives in the largest mansion in the village and who has two butlers, one named Merry and one named Kuro. But Kuro is also introduced to the reader as the chief of the Black Cat Pirates. He intends to take over the city but Usopp discovers the plans from behind and tries to stop him but as Usopp is already recognized as a liar, the villagers do not believe him and therefore only Luffy's crew is able to stop him. Luffy and his crew manage to contain the situation and rescue Kaya and the rest of the village, causing Usopp to join his crew and win an official boat they call Merry Go/Going Merry. The next arc of the story is the Baratie Arc. Since Kaya has given them a new ship, Luffy's crew tries to get a logo for the name of the pirates and the name they choose is Pirates of the Straw Hat (or \"Mugiwara Pirates\" / \"Straw Hat Pirates\"). Luffy and Usopp begin to experience the things that the boat offers them and end up accidentally firing a cannon at a ship that apparently passes through that area. The hunters attack back and Zoro recognizes that it is their fellow hunters, Johnny and Yosaku. The crew let Zoro's companions ship and Nami ends up healing her wounds. The crew quickly realizes they need a cook because it is very important not to die and to stay healthy in the middle of the sea, so the two hunters tell them about a floating ship that exists called Baratie. When they arrive, they enter a fight with a Marine called Fullbody and this one has to shoot a cannon but Luffy uses (once again) the skill of its fruit and sends back the cannon that had been fired, nevertheless it fails in the boat of the marines and Hits the floating boat, Baratie. While Luffy tries to arrange an alternative for the damage he has caused to the owner of the boat, Sanji comes on the scene. After Luffy defeats Krieg, Sanji ends up joining Luffy's crew (because his dream is to find All Blue) and the crew follows in a small boat towards the next adventure. The crew then keeps looking for Nami and the Merry Go. Johnny and Yosaku suspect she is going to Arlong Park because, by the time they were together at Merry Go, Nami kept looking at the wanted poster of Arlong, and moreover, there is nowhere else to go from that particular place in the middle of the sea. When Nami arrives near the big gates of Arlong Park, she sees a little boy who is trying to avenge his father's death. Right now, Nami gives him his stick upstairs and gives him money for him to go home and it is at this point that the reader is told that (actually) Nami is part of Arlong's crew. Usopp, Zoro, and Johnny arrive on the island but Zoro is left behind by the other two. Zoro ends up being caught by the pirates while Usopp is inconsistent with the boy from earlier and so Johnny is the only one who escapes. At the same time, Luffy, Sanji, and Yosuka are attacked by a sea cow but Luffy deals with the situation, using it to get to Arlong Park. Usopp wakes up at Nojiko's house, a village villager who quickly discovers that she is Nami's sister. At the same time, Zoro discovers that Nami works for Arlong as an official navigator, Nami's past is here discovered and so it is here that she discovers why what her goals are and why it is so difficult for her to be like this. Very briefly, Nami wants to save the village from the tyranny of Arlong and that for this, had the plan to raise enough money to buy the island to Arlong, making with the island was independent and that, finally, it did not have to do with the Arlong Park. The crew of Luffy enters the scene at the same time and before Arlong manages to identify who Luffy is, Luffy punches him with a brave punch by knocking him against one of the walls of his Arlong Park and is starting from this punch that begins The fight between the man-fish pirates and Luffy's crew. Eventually, Luffy wins and Nami decides (definitely) to join the Mugiwara as an official navigator. It is in the passage from Arlong Park to Loguetown that Luffy discovers that he had his head on the prize, thus worth 30 million Berries but he feels confident and happy even though Nami makes him see all the responsibility that is going to be to flee to the Marines not to be captured. The trudge decides that Loguetown is a good place to refuel some supplies and to get something to eat. Zoro decides to buy new swords since Mihawk has destroyed his old ones but inside the store, he encounters a familiar (or so he thinks), the crew separates and each one will buy things to his liking. This girl named Tashigi is extremely similar to her childhood friend, Kuina, and inside the store, she helps him choose some swords.\nMeanwhile, Sanji, Usopp, and Nami decide to buy supplies for the boat and finally, Luffy decides to see the place where the king of pirates was executed, Gold D. Roger. Captain Smoker, a Marine, is informed of the situation and decides to execute Luffy before being involved. Nami foresees a storm soon and therefore prepares the ship ready for departure, Zoro and Sanji will save Luffy while Usopp stays with Nami in the boat. After the whole fuss, Luffy is miraculously released and flees to the Merry Go but Smoker chases him in his personalized speck. Eventually, Luffy and Sanji are saved by the Revolutionary leader, Dragon (who is an all-out figure), and they manage to escape along with the rest of the crew at Merry Go and that's how the crew sees their destiny, the Grand Line.\nThe East Blue Saga is a great start to the series and possibly one of the best sagas I've ever had the pleasure of collecting. The saga is slowly introducing characters as it develops small information about people previously revealed. It also has small cultural references as the concept of each character for each crew or from where came the idea of writing a story of pirates. \nIt is mainly the art that makes the manga, as the story is interconnected between the characters, the reading of the story is continuous and from there, it is simply impossible to stop reading. There are some things defined by Eiichiro Oda that I don't agree with, like Luffy's followed victories or Luffy's excessive protagonist during the saga, although I find normal the conviviality between the characters. However, I feel that Usopp or Sanji didn't have their 'zen' moment but I believe in its potential. \nI recommend the East Blue saga to anyone who believes in Eiichiro Oda, One Piece and all the potential that the introduction story makes known to the reader.\nStory: 8 | Art: 10 | Character: 9 | Enjoyment: 9\nScore: 9\nPersonal Note: The actual manga volumes done by VIZ are my all-time favorite volumes and look awesome on the shelf and I personally love the shiny volumes which are almost exclusively to East Blue and Alabasta arcs, respectively.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="               \n    Ok so I gave 10s to all: story, art, character, enjoyment, and overall.\nI gave this manga a 10 even though it deserves, like, 1000.\nOne Piece is a battle mainstream manga. It is full of action and fights, and at first glance might seem stupid and random, but oh gods believe me, this is so very likely to be the BEST battle shounen manga you guys will have ever read. Widely classified as the top three most popular battle series alongside Naruto and Bleach, I've got to admit that One Piece is just.... way above those two. One Piece stands on top, the pinnacle of perfection,\n          \n        so posh and fabulous and flawless and pretentious.\nStory - The story tells us about the adventure of Monkey D. Luffy, a very fiery young boy who dreams to be the Pirate King. The story starts from when he first set sail, and he gradually collects one member at a time to join his pirate crew. To me the story is original (I mean, who talks about pirates nowadays?) and the execution is nothing less than PERFECT. Can't talk about all the arcs because this manga has more than 700 chapters at the moment, but from the very start, when Luffy met the first man to join his journey, from that time on, the story progressed real smoothly, and real intriguing.\nOne Piece is one of the most complex series I've ever read-- it's full of unanswered questions at the moment. All the mysteries waiting to be solved-- ahh the thrill! Even though there are still so many holes until the main story is fully revealed, it doesn't make me feel agitated at all. My curiosity is perfectly fine and healthy, and I will patiently wait until everything gets explained. On the other side, I have a rather high expectation for the revelation, but looking at past experience and how Odacchi, the author, has brought the story so far, I have no complaints.\nOdacchi also doesn't seem to run out of ideas. One Piece is overflowing with wild, wild imagination. So many awesome things support this manga and make it even more surprising. I mean how many people in this world would ever think of making snails as a medium of communication? How many people would ever create mermaids with specific fish types? How many people would ever think of creating the Void Century, mysterious devil fruits, poneglyphs, the Marines and their posh Justice cape, Will of D, Sea Kings, and Yarukiman Mangrove?? I suppose nobody but Odacchi could ever make these epicness possible.\nArt - The art starts off rather funny and functional, but Odacchi has always had this intricate, unique style to his drawings that is impossible not to notice. As time flies and chapters by chapters go, the art metamorphosed into something, not entirely new, but more brilliant and more beautiful. The art is really cool and it goes really well with Odacchi's wonderful imagination. There are sceneries and odd stuffs drawn so well you can't help but go whooaaa. The only minus I can note is how Odacchi draws with such vigor the fight scenes can be really confusing if you're not following well. But it still doesn't change the fact that the art is amazing.\nCharacter - One Piece as a long running series is also supported by its diverse characters. We have seen a lot, so much characters in more than 700 chapters and despite all of the cliches and the i-will-protect-my-nakama type of people, they are still real fun and real engrossing. Our main pirate crew even consists of three inhuman beings: a living skeleton, a talking reindeer, and a cyborg wearing Hawaiian Aloha shirt. What do you guys expect? Good characters don't always have to be humans yanno. There is Surume the kraken. Even Going Merry has her own human personification. I mean, I have so many characters in my mind when I want to write their names my mind go blank. But that's it. You guys take my point.\nEnjoyment - F*ck, how I enjoyed this manga. I enjoyed it too much, in fact. This manga is just simply entertaining and every arcs will keep you glued to your seat. I spent so much words describing my feelings above I can't seem to make anymore words to express how I love this manga. In short, this is a real masterpiece that nobody should ever miss, regardless of whether this is their cup of tea or not. One Piece is exceptional. When you realized it, you'll find yourself craving for more, not wanting to stop.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="             \n    I first started reading One Piece about 5 years ago and no matter how hard I tried I just couldn't get into the series. I will admit I fell for the classic problem at the beginning of a series with \"the artwork.\" It drove me insane. So I dropped the series and came back to it about 2 years ago and boy am I happy I did. Once I managed to push through those first few chapters, this series dragged into depths of fandom I'd never experienced before.\n\nStory: 10\nThis comedic adventure is set in a place where pirates roamed the earth. Our protagonist Luffy sets\n          \n        off on a journey to become the king of the pirates. Along the way he meets many people, including his motley crew, all with their own dreams; as well as countless villains with or without devil fruits (which give people special powers, but takes away their ability to swim.)\nWhile the basis of One Piece is quite simple, the story arcs bring real-world problems into it. From discrimination and racism, to corruption and slavery - the world of One Piece has seen it all. These themes bring about a depth to this fantasy.\nWith these story arcs, even though they are separate tales, they all interconnect with one another throughout the series. Minor foreshadowing in one arc can lead to major plot developments later on. An attractive thing about One Piece is that there's no limit to what can happen. \n\nArt: 9\nAs I said earlier, the artwork at the beginning of One Piece was hard to digest as Oda was still a \"rookie.\" However as the story progressed the art got better - MUCH better. The fighting scenes are well done and it's fairly easy to tell what's happening during them (which is always a plus xD). What I really enjoy about the artwork is that it doesn't overuse screentones like many manga tend to do. And while this ties into the \"character\" section as well, I love the creativity of the character designs especially for the villains.\n\nCharacters: 9\nI find that the real gem in One Piece is not always the storyline, but the characters met along the way. First we have the crew, all unique in their own respects: (I'm going to try and keep it short...no promises though)\n- Luffy, the captain may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but he has a strong sense of determination and friendship. And if he scouts you for his crew, it's best to just give in. He'll win in the end anyway.\n- Zoro, the directionally challenged swordsman is hardheaded and can probably sleep anywhere, but is loyal to Luffy. His constant snipping with Sanji is hilarious, but his sword skills are badass.\n- Nami, the navigator used to be a weak link always needing saving, but this violent, sassy girl can now hold her own with the rest of the crew.\n- Usopp, the lying sniper who wants to be a great man of the sea, is comedic and gets very attached to everyone. While at first he was afraid of everything, he now knows how to take care of his own fights.\n- Sanji, the ship's cook is a complete ladies man. When fighting \"Black Leg Sanji\" only uses his legs and this guy knows how to branch off from the rest of the crew to get some major stuff done.\n- Chopper, the Strawhat's doctor and human/reindeer zoan fruit user is sweet and earnest. He wants to be able to cure any disease. \n- Robin, the Archaeologist. While having a difficult past, she finally found where she belongs on the crew. This level-headed girl is the logical one in a mass of hot-heads and her curiosity often gets the better of her.\n- Franky, the cyborg shipwright wants to sail 1000 seas in a ship he built. His somewhat perverted nature is hilarious at times. He runs on cola and believes he is \"SUUUPER\" - both of which Usopp and Chopper seem to agree with. xD\n- Brook - the skeletal musician who lost his shadow. This complete perv, who is always asking to see the girls' panties is not only skilled with music, but also with a sword. He brings a fun atmosphere to the crew.\nLastly we have villains. What makes One Piece really special to me is the massive amount of MEMORABLE villains. From Crocodile and Baroque Works TO Spandam and CP9 TO Doflamingo and the Doquixote Family (although that last grouping isn't my favourite.) Oda knows how to create a great villain. Although I have to say that at times they can look a little disturbing. *cough* Senor Pink *cough*\nOverall, the characters are really well done. Many of the characters have quite a bit of depth, especially as we dive into their backstories.\n\nEnjoyment: 10\nI always enjoy reading One Piece and I anxiously await the release of each chapter, groaning when the series goes on break for a week and grinning when a massive plot twist or an exciting reveal happens. If that doesn't constitute enjoyment, then I don't know what does. xD\n\nOverall: 9.5 (rounded to 10)\nWhile every series has its faults (and One Piece is no exception), One Piece is enjoyable to read with good characters, themes, and plots. It well deserves a high rank for any adventure-lover. \n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="          \n    One Piece. I love this series and you should too. I admit, when I first decided to try reading the series I was put off by the horrible 4kids One Piece dub, thinking the manga would be utter crap, aimed at pre-pubescent kids. But when I actually started reading it and got into it, I realised it was an interesting and worthwhile read.\nI'll keep it simple with a few key points as to why you should read it: it's characters are interesting, the battles are usually satisfying and the manga isn't the typical one-dimensional stuff you usually find in shounen - while it may simply\n          \n        look like a manga aimed at children from the outside, the stories of people in One Piece usually have much deeper meanings.\nYou may be intimidated by the length of it (631 and counting!). Don't be. As soon as you start, you'll fly through all those chapters and be hungry for more. Your desire for OP will never be sated. Maybe the art is a turn-off? It may not appeal to everyone, but after a while you might just find yourself loving it and the unique character designs in the series. \nYou might be debating more reasons in your head but the easiest way is to simply sit down and try reading it. If it doesn't initially seem that good, don't give up! You could be missing out on a potential favourite. I recommend reading at least fifty chapters before passing any judgement but that's just me.

I would say the overall perspective of One Piece can be mirrored to that of The Lion King. It's impossible to dislike the Lion King, because it addressed so many themes that relate to ourselves and society. The same goes for One Piece. One Piece addresses the importance of Friends, Family, Trust, Goal Orientation, Belief, Happiness, Sadness, and all the common themes that make us go through the day and want to read page from page. Each journey and island that is included in the making of the\n          \n        One Piece story tackles a different theme, and with it different obstacles and challenges. Just like The Lion King is a story which we always remember of a lion who lost his father in return to fight for his throne, I will always remember One Piece as the journey a pirate named Luffy ventured to be the King of Pirates and find the hidden treasure, One Piece.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="           \n    One Piece takes a while to get going and can be a rather difficult franchise to get into, especially with its raw length. The series is largely dedicated to introducing protagonists early on whom only improve as it goes on, starting out fairly lackluster. Luffy and Zoro, the main protagonists, are generic and largely exist just as generic protagonists to go through the arcs and defeat the villains. The other 7 crew members all get pretty heavy development with plenty of likable qualities, though, so it's not a slog aside from the start. The series really begins with the Arlong arc a good 75 chapters\n          \n        in.\nThe series should largely be read for the big villain arcs, as they are the highlight of the series. While the minions of the villains aren't used much, this is largely done to glorify the current arc's villain above all others and is done to pretty great effect. Some arcs, most notably Rob Lucci and Crocodile, tend to drag a bit, but these are few and far between. \nThe best villains are those whom have dedicated arcs to themselves and are defeated, but the series has massive amounts of power creep with characters getting stronger and stronger. This alone wouldn't be that bad of a problem, as it is expected in most any shonen, but the characters who are built up as invincible threats are background non characters such as Shanks and Mihawke. Constantly glorifying characters such as these who do absolutely nothing over villains who had great arcs gets very tiresome very quickly, and the author constantly dangles them in front of the reader's face with promise to actually use them then never actually does.\nIn addition, the author has an obsession with not allowing any characters to die, even retroactively resurrecting the most minor of characters. This is almost always a bad thing for villains, as instead of dying they're retroactively humiliated when they show up much later in the series as weaklings. The one exception to this is the Impel Down arc, which is a prison break arc involving a lot of the old villains.\nThe manga is at its best when focusing on just one big villain at a time in an arc for the most part, and these segments are plenty worth reading the manga for. The only big continuity comes from the Impel Down and Marineford arcs, which brings everything to a pretty satisfying climax and may as well be the end of the manga, as only a few relatively episodic arcs have been written after it.\nOne Piece does a great job of world building as it goes along, introducing dozens of characters and locations it goes out of its way to develop and make memorable. The manga begins to go a bit overboard with the quantity of characters it produces, as the author is incredibly ambitious with his assumption that he'll get around to using them all. The flood of characters can make it difficult to get some of the earlier styled arcs focusing on a single villain, especially after Marineford.\nAs messy as One Piece can be, at its core it is a very simple shonen that does little to subvert the genre with good climaxes and fights, which is great if that's what you're looking for. Later on, some of the villains decay and the protagonists become too powerful for the villains to put up much fight, but the best moments of the manga are already past you at that point.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="             \n    One Piece has a very wacky cast of characters; We have a pirate that can stretch yet can't swim, a guy that utilizes 3 swords and has the worst sense of direction ever, a money loving navigator, a liar that's an amazing sniper, a cook that's a ladies man, a reindeer that's a doctor, a calm archaeologist that's among the most wanted women in the world, a cyborg shipwright, and a skeleton musician. Yet... it works.\nThe story is pretty interesting, and has a lot of dramatic, and heartbreaking moments. The world is vast, and his continually expanding, which is one of the strong points of\n          \n        One Piece. However, it does become a bit repetitive, with similar formulas each time. However, Oda has started to change up that formula a bit more. I started getting bored before, thanks to the repeating formula, but when Oda started changing it up, that got me more excited.\nThe art style is actually one of, if not my favourite point of One Piece. Each of the characters look so different, you can never mistake one character for another. They all have their own unique design, and this makes it work very well. Other times though, it can be a little messy. Nonetheless, Oda's drawing style is unique and creative. On a side note, I LOVE how Oda doesn't make crying look pretty. The characters make a mess out of themselves when they're crying, just as real people would. (Granted, there tend to be too many tears.)\nThe characters are all unique, and have wildly varying personalities. They all have a backstory, and a lot of the villains do as well, which just goes to show how much effort Oda has put in to making these characters. They could stand a bit more development, but they're all memorable. I also enjoy the relationship these characters have with one another. I also LOVE the fact that Oda doesn't just forget about the characters, and creates mini side-arcs on the chapter covers, showing the influence that the straw hats made on some characters, most notably Coby and Helmeppo.\nI seriously recommend this to almost anyone; but be warned. It's REALLY long.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="             \n    Eiichiro Oda surprised me with a great series. It starts getting better even from the very beggining, just after the three first (and tinier) arcs. The story, after the first three villains, tends to get more complex, intelligent and well-written. \nEven though most of the characters is crazy, their personalities are built around a great story that surprises by the level of complexity in a shonen. It's not like it's difficult to understand it (as it is made for teenagers and focused on pure entertainment), but yet by some parts of the plot and specially by the questions section, (where the readers ask what they\n          \n        want to the writer), we can notice how the author has a great knowledge of science and history, which greatly enriches the quality of the work.\nThat can be easily perceived by some commentaries of Oda about the weapons of the time, the story of the real pirates, and even scientific explanation of real and fictional phenomena during the series. And that doesn't nullify the great humorous ability of the writer in several comical situations. \nAlso does very good in emotive/sensitive parts. Passes in a very good way the feelings of the characters. Can easily make yiu feel truly sorry for a character that is suffering, want to kill some other, and cry with the third one, and scream with happinesswith a fourth. \nThe art is different than those from many other manga, but it's very funny sometimes and very serious some other times. Expressions always translate well the characters mood, form angry to sadness, form joy to depression. \nIt's a must watch for fans of a good comedy, well elaborated stories and action manga. One of the best shonen ever made.\n        "},

Every chapter is equally intense, every volume is legendary. Every character is unique. One Piece, a manga you should definitely read before you die.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="              \n      This is the first review I'm writing in this website so far, so please, don't judge my grammar.\n  One Piece is the best-selling manga series in all history. I'm not the kind of people who care about \"the more people read something, the better it is\", but this fact at least shows us this manga is worth some shit.\n  Yes, it really is.\n  One Piece is a part of the team of the successful shonens of the third millenium, amongst Naruto, Bleach and currently Fairy Tail and Toriko, now that Naruto is finished. Nevertheless, One Piece is someway different from\n          \n        them. But why?\n  First of all, there's a question in a need to be answered: what makes a good shonen? I think most people would answered \"comedy, adventure and action\". One Piece definitively has it. The amount of characters in the story makes it stand in a rather unique ground. Every fighter have different abilities, different weaknesses. And the comic situations Eiichiro Oda create are just hilarious. But the real thing that makes One Piece unique among the others long-running shonens is: It is not just one story. Every arc is different, each one has a specific story to tell, a specific pack of characters to present, all of them with its exquisite characteristics and motivations. The Alabasta arc is completely different from the CP9 arc, which is completely different from the Marineford arc (just to make some examples).\n  But it is the time when I come to talk something about the story. Not too much, just a preamble.\n  One Piece tells the story of a person named Monkey D. Luffy. He is a good fellow who wants to be a pirate. But not the usual kind of pirate, the ones who steal, put some homes on fire and murder. He wants to be a pirate to make a really good group of friends, have fun and kick some asses. He is one of the most easygoing people you will ever find in a fictional story. He really doesn't care about things most people would complain a lot. And he is completely honest; he always tells the truth, even when he lies (paraphrasing Scarface). He's got his first crew member in the beginning chapters: Roronoa Zoro, a swordsman who uses three swords that has a great ambition: to be the greatest swordsman in the world, and his man after became Luffy's right arm. The other members of the Straw Hat Pirates appeared after, and most of them didn't really liked Luffy at first, but then they became fond of his unique personality.\n  The last thing I want to talk about is the art. This is quite a contentious subject, for I know some people who like to criticize it. I somehow understand why they complain about, but I don't agree with them. It is said that the characters of One Piece are not well drawn. This is mainly because One Piece doesn't have the characteristic design of a manga, with the tram-sized eyes and all that stuff. But all the places are magnifically depicted: the sort of details in the sceneries is just amazing. And it makes me really like it.\n  Overall, One Piece is the best shonen I read so far. I'm not a real fan of this genre, but this story captivated me.\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="           \n    I'm not trying to be at all objective with this review, as I have grown up reading this manga, so it's inevitable that my partiality is going to shine through just a bit. Well, more than a bit. My \"review\" is, more or less, a praise bonanza.\nOne Piece has been a part of my life for a long time, now. It was only the second manga I ever caught up to so to speak, and it's been going on for so long that it's damn near impossible for me to write a proper review for for the series. There have been so many arcs that\n          \n        I don't even know where to begin, and, truth be told, the storyline has never truly been what drives me to continue looking forward to new chapters week after week, anyway.\nWhat makes One Piece truly special to me is it's light hearted characters, fun sense of adventure, and humour. Few Manga have been able to invoke audible laughter from me, and One Piece is on that list. With the exception of the Impel Down and Marine Ford arcs, the series seldom loses sight of these elements.\nAnother especially notable aspect of the series is it's characters. There are a wealth of stand-out characters in One Piece. Not only are almost all of them unique and peculiar in their own ways, but each and every one of them is fleshed out over the course of the various arcs. By the time I'd caught up to the weekly releases, Luffy's crew, and even a surprising number of the side characters, had begun to feel like old friends, and that \"bond\" has only grown stronger over the years.\nFurthermore, One Piece's artwork is uniquely stylistic, and aids the overall light hearted feel of the manga brilliantly. The backgrounds are nicely fleshed out. The various islands the crew visits throughout the series are uniquely themed. The characters who inhabit them, almost without fail, have their own quirky traits to coincide with the crazy lands they live in.\nCharacter design is an area in which One Piece both excels and fails. In the early chapters, it is sometimes difficult to tell some of the characters apart. This is a problem many manga seem to have, especially when it comes to female characters. A chief example of this is Vivi, Nami, and Kaya; Without the aide of unique hair colours to tell them apart, they look nearly identical. Later chapters more or less rectify this fault, though, as the new character designs begin to look more fantastic, even as the art style grows more realistic.\nOne Piece receives a great deal of hate from certain Anime fans, some of it deservedly so. It is most certainly not a series that everyone can enjoy, but, if you're looking for a fun, quirky series, and you don't mind a few Shounen clichés, I would highly recommend that you at least give it a chance.\nOverall, reading this series has been an almost entirely positive experience for me. That's not to say that it hasn't had it's low moments, but the highs far outweigh the lows in this grand adventure. I have yet to find another anime or manga that embodies the spirit of kinship and adventure in quite the same way as One Piece. This is a series that, to me, will never grow old.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="             \n    One Piece is the best anime I've seen to date! It is difficult for me to properly convey how great it is in a review.\nOn the surface, the story might seem typical: a wonder-boy who wants to \"be the best\" fights the bad guys and always wins. But I think what makes One Piece so popular are the details that you begin to appreciate as you stick with the series.\nThe situations the main characters encounter have their own back stories. Even minor characters can have a chance to have their stories told, and it usually gets connected back (eventually) to the main story. This makes\n          \n        the story vast, but amazingly, not over-complicated. Adding to the richness are other details such as real-life natural phenomena and folklore that are occasionally incorporated and explained in the series.\nThe series has a sense of wonder, playfulness, and conviction that pulls you in. The drawing style may look startling at first, but is an important part of the uniqueness of the series.\nOne Piece follows the dumb-but-strong-and-spirited Monkey D. Luffy in the pursuit of his dream--to become king of the pirates. Not because he's hungry for power, but rather because he is hungry for freedom! He looks up to pirates who are not the typical villains you might think of. Luffy gives pirates a good name, at least with the people he meets and helps along the way.\nOn his journeys, Luffy recruits a diverse, yet small crew, each with their own dream. Despite having different goals and the fact they don't always seem to get along, the crew is dedicated and will put their lives on the line for their crew-mates.\nThe adventures the Strawhat Pirates go on are often action-packed and awe-inspiring. Along the way, there is plenty of comedy as well. There are also serious moments, especially when it comes to the crew sticking up for each other.\n        "},

KEEP GOING (G)ODA SENSEI!\nI will not ruin anything and I'm sure I am not really adding to any of these reviews because so many people adore this series, but honestly: no other manga makes me laugh more than this one, nothing!! I've actually burst out laughing in the middle of quiet public places (like the library) and I've laughed so hard that I've cried. There are also times where the story is so moving and touching that I'll cry in\n          \n        the middle of public places (like Borders Cafe).  There's something really special about this manga, the way it so easily evokes emotions.  I have literally enjoyed every single arc in this manga so far, not even a wasted page!  Also, the stories are endlessly re-readable.  I've read One Piece first volume to most recent volume about 8 times already and I find even more things I like about it each time I re-read it.  \nAll of the characters are so interesting and likable. And by that I mean, of course, all the Straw Hats, but I also mean all the villains and even the minor characters! I love the artwork too; every character is completely different. And they are all drawn so cleverly and uniquely!  And batshit insane things happen to all of them, hahahha.  Oda puts so much thought and creativity into each character, no matter how minor a role they play, so I'm always sad to see ANY character get killed off.  Thank goodness that doesn't happen too often.  \nThis is not an \"overrated\" manga despite it being one of the big three.  There is a real reason why it is the best-selling manga in Japan.  It's a fantastic series and I urge everyone to try it.  Also incredibly quote-worthy and inspirational.  I have had many WWLD (What Would Luffy Do?) moments.  \n"},

Even though, the huge amount seems daunting, it's fine. Take your time. We,your fellow readers, will patiently await you arrival abroad the ship.\nLong Review:\nA lot of people say One Piece fans make it seem Bigger than Life. Well,of course. Have you read about the guy who was going through\n          \n        depression, complementing sucide but one day after picking up One Piece,he kept reading and reading and because of something a character you said, he was inspired. He highlighted that quote,came back to it time after time and the quote gave him power to turn his life around.\nI can't speak for that guy,but personally One Piece has been part of my life from Late Elementary School to End of Highschool(and looks like it will be following me into College as well). Week to week, I have enjoyed it not only as a work of Fiction but also as a source of inspiration. By tackling issues like Class discrimination, Race discrimination, Abuse of power,poverty, and much more, it has taught you to be better person than any thing at school. \nHeck, the reason where I am today(graduating high school with a GPA of 3.75 ) all started because in 7th grade, I decided I am gonna study a lot, get a good job and buy all the One Piece Volumes. Thinking back,the reason is so freaking silly,but hey Inspiration comes in many forms.\nAlso a little rant :\nOne of the dumbest reason I have seen people rate One Piece low is because the main characters are Pirates yet they don't act like historical real-life pirates. Let me tell you why you DON'T wanna be one of those people, and save you from the embrassment; \nNaruto is a ninja who wears bright color jumpsuits.\nGoku is an alien, but to this day Humanity hasn't encountered Aliens.\nNo reports of Ancient Egyptian Pharaohs playing card games.\nYou cannot catch real-life animals in a spherical objects.\nYou can't kill a person by writing their name in a notebook.\nDo you see how DUMB it sounds to say that One Piece characters are not realistic pirates? (For one,it's not even Planet Earth,why are you thinking your reality is the same as the fictional one?)\nNow back to the review ;\nOne Piece doesn't need to be in Manga form, because at it's core It's a STORY. It doesn't rely on shock factors, or something as simple as creating a fictional character that shows off it's fictional strength by destroying fictional stuff. And Unlike the cries of it's haters claim, it is not a cash cow. Oda Eiichiro was ranked #2 by the people in the list of most beloved authors in 2015. Why? Because for over a decade now, One Piece has inspired,changed, and entertained millions in Japan and millions of others around the globe.  \nI know there are a lot of episodes and chapters, but trust me, don't skip them. Take a break, make a schedule, Doesn't matter if it takes a year. Once you catch up, you will be the one writing this review.\n        "},

Luffy who travels the world in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece. Such a simple premise, but Oda is able to keep it interesting in every chapter, every volume, and every arc.\nThe world building of One Piece is just peerless. There is no manga bigger than One Piece in terms of scale and lore running right now. Oda somehow made it possible for islands floating in the sky, islands made of cakes and candy, and an island on top of a gigantic elephant to coexist in the\n          \n        same world seamlessly without making them feel out of place. Despite the sheer size of this world, it is without any empty space; complex politics, centuries worth of history, diverse imaginative creatures, and diverse cultures are sprinkled generously all over this world.\nThe characters are just so full of personality and well written. They are not just fictional characters, long time readers like myself consider them like real people we share a deep connection with. This might sound cheesy but I truly feel like grew up \"with\" them, not just grew up reading them.\nDo not overlook the art just because it looks cartoonish. The visuals storytelling and paneling are clear. The fights are truly moving and nail-biting. All of Luffy's punches, Zoro's sword swings, Sanji's kicks, and Usopp's bullet shots are drawn in the flashiest way. The comedic moments are enhanced by the expressions and visual cues. The background and geography are beautiful and comprehensive.\nYou most certainly can binge read the whole series, almost 900 chapters, effortlessly. My second and third times rereading this manga is better than the last. I kept finding new details that Oda prepared beforehand and seeing the iconic memorable moments in a new light. When seeing Coby from chapter 2, I feel so much anticipation and hype for his upcoming growth- His reunion with Luffy after Water7 Arc and his speech from Marineford war are just too good - and this is only a side character from chapter 2. My feelings when seeing Ace, Mihawk, and Robin in their first appearance are all the more overwhelming.\n10/10, wish I can give it a higher score.\n        "},

I'm pretty sure a long positive review is not really needed since a fan already know it and a hater would deny everything. I make it for anyone who never read One Piece, standing in neutral ground, purely want to know the secret behind its success.\nOne Piece is a mainstream shonen battle manga. The story is really simple, about a boy who goes on an adventure because he wants to be a pirate king. You can even change the dream part in the premise to anything like 'the strongest man', 'number one man in cooking department', 'hokage', anything.\n          \n        It sounds really mainstream, right? But why does ut feel so different with any other mainstream shonen battle manga?\nMaybe the story is too captivating, yes. With a lot of plot twist to the point of infinite number of people's predictions are just wrong. Eiichiro Oda is capable to foreshadow a huge revelation, even for hundreds chapters after. If there's someone say One Piece has similar and repetitive plot, don't trust him. Believe in Oda; he promised to make a story unlike we've ever read before.\nFrom the simple story, it's getting complex and more exciting, to the point of you will laugh at people judging One Piece as manga for little kids. There's a lot of things going on and you'll start to regret not to read carefully every single panel before. Enjoy wondering how huge Oda's notebook is.\nAnd the characters are too adorable. Nothing easier than liking the awesome main character but the other characters are awesome too. They are different, they have their unique traits, and they are have their own charms. Pfft. One Piece don't even need good looking ikemen main antagonist to make him likable.\nFor you who are curious to start reading it, you will be surprised with the art. It his unique style, the art which makes you instantly recognize. You'll get used to it in instant. Beside Oda's art shows how much he put effort to describe the awesomeness of One Piece universe.

If you are looking for pure on battle manga which is filled with the greatest ever fights, than Naruto and Bleach may be of better quality to you then One Piece, this is not to say One Piece doesn't have good fights, it's just not what the emphasis of the manga is on.\nInstead One Piece emphasizes adventure and story. On the adventure criteria One Piece is the standard, the\n          \n        environments are diverse and detailed, the art style is quirky yet approachable, and the characters fit to the same descriptors. There is a lot of hype about the One Piece story (and some criticism on this is justified) but One Piece is very, very well done especially considering for how long this series has been going. I realize my review says I am at Manga 99 right now, but I have watched the anime further than this, and read some of the most recent chapters on the Dressrosa Arc and the quality of the writing is so much more developed and interesting than it was when it first started. That is saying a lot!!! Many complain about it's length, and perhaps this is justified - especially for those with short attention spans. However, I also have a very short attention span and usually can't sit through 30 minutes of any movie but I managed to get into One Piece.\nI do attribute that though to where I was introduced to the anime as a kid which was in the Arlong Park arc, which intrigued me into finding out more about the series. For people looking to pick up One Piece, I do think the earliest arcs (up to the first 7 volumes) are nothing special and can be a bit boring, Arlong Park has the reputation of being where most of the readers to One Piece get hooked, and the story becomes far better from there on out. If you are looking to pick up this manga you may have to suffer through the first arcs to get to Arlong Park arc, if you don't like Arlong Park arc than this may be a signal that One Piece is not for you!!!\nOverall, a light-hearted, fun, yet sometimes very serious manga that is a pleasure to read!

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="               \n    100/10, this is EASILY the BEST manga I have ever read. There aren't enough good things to say about it. #GODA\nI understand that it's length can turn people away which it did to me at first but it is well worth the investment. Part of me wants it to end so my friends will actually start watching it and another part (vast majority) of me doesn't want it to end because I can't get enough. All I ask for is that I can live to see the end of it.\nA reason for its length is because of the emphasis on backstories which can take quite\n          \n        a bit of chapters. Personally, I don't mind this one bit (in the long run) because this builds character development and can make one more attached to a character. For instance, I enjoyed Sanji's backstory so much that in the Whole Cake Island popularity poll, I voted for him. The sole reason was because his backstory was so compelling and I felt like he deserved a chance to be number 2... unfortunately that didn't happen. Honestly the lovable characters are probably the reason why I fell in love with One Piece.\nLet me start off and say, One Piece has the best world building potential ever. With each island having a theme, there are as many different and unique islands as Oda can come up with. The Marine system is interesting as well especially incorporating the Shichibukai. The Yonko are another major power that has endless possibilities in the story.I almost forgot about the Revolutionary Army, again, another major power that had extreme potential.\nThe devil fruits, one of the most important and iconic aspects of One Piece. Each of these fruits has their own unique powers (kind of an example of when it isn't is a case like the kilo-kilo fruit and the ton-ton fruit). Luffy- the main character has the gomu-gomu no mi which basically makes his body made of rubber. One might think it has no use in fighting (which Ace says) but Luffy is one of the strongest fighters in the world now. It's Oda's creativity that makes things that appear weak to be strong (more examples- the egg-egg fruit, bisc-bisc fruit (biscuit) are surprisingly strong). Basically (Oda's creativity > rational thought).\nThe humour in One Piece isn't as good as other manga/anime like Gintama or One Punch Man but its definitely better than the vast majority. I think most of the good humour is towards the beginning of the series but its apparent even in the later chapters. Also, if one knows basic Japanese vocab then the puns will crack you up (granted there's an editors note- the anime does a better job of the humour is you're watching it because you can hear the pun... I don't know if that made sense).\nOne complaint that I have is that not many people die in the story. I mean, I like a lot of the characters but death makes you appreciate the current characters even more so. Also, the pacing can be really slow but if you've read this far already on a review then you definitely have the patience for One Piece.\nThe art style of One Piece is a little odd compared to most other anime/manga but I'm a fan of it. One Piece is really easy to read- the panel placement is amazing. Oda's full page panels are absolutely exquisite and oh so beautiful displaying an epic or iconic moment within the story. Character design is also very good with each character having special features about them.\nAction scenes are another engaging things about this series because what's a good shounen without fight scenes? My personal opinion says that the fights scenes are not the best..... HOWEVER, Oda's creativity in powers and techniques well makes up for a small lack of beautiful fight scenes.\nAnyways, I kinda got tired of writing so... ya... One Piece is the BEST in my opinion and second place isn't even close by (next is Koe no Katachi, if you ain't watched it then do it - way better than Your Name). Anyways, listen to me when I say this is well worth your time, it is as close to perfect as one can get.\nHope this was helpful... :'D\nPS. If you made it this far you have the patience for sure to do the ONE PIECE (I'm sorry, I'm tired).\n        "},

People are ok with this and it’s acceptable\nOda was able to succesfully  perceived  this, as a resort when  Usually  in manga girls  are only  sweetener ,   weak , and dependent  creature  who  sooner or later will  fall in love with the  main characters. Nami and robin  are strong , smart and can’t hold their ground.  Yes  there  are lot of fan services from these two,  but sexy  girls have rights to flaunt their body.\nOda  also  has  a way to get  fresh ideas for the story. You know  Usop pirates  gallery right?  Long before  the first appearence of brooke.  A fan submitted  a  drawing of  one piece crew in skeletal form,  ( Sorry  i forgot in wich volume the drawing appeared.   Another  drawing showed the crew in women dresses..   He has plenty of inspiration.\nPersonally , to me  OP  should have ended  at volume 55.   Oda  had intended to end OP a long time ago.   Why, because personally  i dislike  the current artwork of nami and robin ,  the fisherman island saga also dissapointed me.  The crew used to get what they want without other people’s help, they can survive without being burden. But  a powerful figure  in OP world sacrificed himself  for the crew . It felt so wrong\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="               \n    Ahhhh One Piece, the most loved and or hated series for being loved. \nWhen I was little, I actually didn't like it compared to various other Shounen manga running at the time. The characters just seemed way too silly and uncool.\nWasn't until I was bored and picked up the 10 volumes of the manga from a local library that I noticed I was turning the pages like crazy. I ended up spending the whole night catching up and before you know it I got hooked.\nBut why?\nThe main characters power is literally stretching. It's goofy, it's silly, it's like... how the hell are you going to\n          \n        win m8? Compared to everyone elses advantages, yet it works and flows. \nEnjoyment 10/10:\nIt's just something about the flow of One Piece. \nSmall spoiler: First chapter, The main character gets sucked into a typhoon, goes into a barrel and wakes up later. You'll see many more of these instances of this later on.\nThis opens excitement in a sense. Where will the characters land? What's going to happen? What kind of wacky place are we going to end up next? \nOverall 10/10:\nTL;DR : One Piece is a very silly comedic action and adventurous series that emphasizes on world building and mystery. \nIt's a very almost near perfect balance of wacky comedic+action that somehow still stays serious. It has a extremely CRAZY world(don't want to list out the things), \nliterally. It's like if a cooking series were to turn into a full blown mecha and then a steampunk. \nYet it still oddly, it fits right in. I even question it, about how a series can jam so much and still work.\nFight scenes feel more entertaining and unique because most often it's silly how the characters fight. \nMost series emphasize on how serious a fight needs to be, how its violence and it shouldn't be fun but One Piece brings out the FUN in violence, similar to the fun and chaos in GTA(Grand Theft Auto).\nOne of the big tropes of One Piece is that it has quite the \"dark/tragic\" moments to balance the wackiness and show everyone that there is something going on. This makes it appeal less \"edgy\" and more balanced, giving you the best of both worlds.\nStory 10/10: \nThe plot is to find the One Piece, a treasure in the Grand Line. Just establishing this alone already raises mystery. \nDoes it even exist? Where the hell is it? Why hasn't anyone found it? \nThis sets up a large expansive world alone and braces you for a long wacky adventure.\nYou'll see the most weirdest creatures, weirdest things yet it still magically fits.\nThis is all centered around Monkey D. Luffy, an ambitious boy set to find it. What's interesting about this protagonist is that he just defies logic of your expectations.\n For example, normally if someone asks you out on a date and you reject, you'd expect that it would be the end of it, but Luffy would defy your logic because screw you, that's why. He'd make you want to eventually want to date him, which is quite funny when you think about it. He just does what he wants and hopes to move forward which adds to the wackiness of the series. \nOf course he has the goal of wanting to be the \"Pirate king\" and finding the treasure \"One Piece\" but, what the hell is the \"Pirate king\"? Are all pirates going to listen to him or something? This adds sort of a mysterious deeper vibe into the series because no one knows what the One Piece is , nor what the Pirate king does.\nArt 10/10:\nDuring the bloom of the Shounen, a lot of manga followed the whole \"big eyes\" style(Naruto, Bleach, etc). In fact, it was mentioned that the editors/Jump were worried about Oda drifting towards this style. \nOne Piece has been heavily criticized for looking terrible but I see it as unique, not following set standards. Its tolerable, some backgrounds even look gorgeous. I really don't know how to rate/critique the annoying and complex topic known as  \"Art\", so I give it a 10 for ever series because I'm if not more entrenched into the story to care about the looks.\n\nCharacters 10/10:\nYou will see the most weirdest characters known to man. I don't want to spoil too much but every character has their flaws,  hence why a pirate crew is needed in the first place. It shows itself that no 1 person can be an OP badass and win all alone. \nShounen Powerup argument:\nA lot of arguments of why people don't try One Piece is that it seems like a friendship powerup series. Looking through all the battles, only 5-10% of it was. The rest is just pirates running around wanting to push forward to their goals.\nLogically speaking though, why is this trope so hated on? If a close friend of yours gets hit, you probably will get angry and upset leading to a power up as blood and adrenaline rushes through your body since you're mentally preparing for a fight or flight scenario.\n"},

The narrative mostly revolves around the characters but in some instances, the focus is entirely on atmosphere and the setting which makes One Piece very unique as a series.\nEach Arc has something new and takes another step in developing\n          \n        these wonderful characters but it takes it's time and that's a good thing.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="               \n    One Piece is a masterpiece of storytelling that anyone should watch during his lifetime! So what are the gems that lie beneath this story, in general? (I''ll comment about the anime version at the end of this review)\nSTORY 10: (personal importance factor [pif] x1.2)\nWell, there is a lot that can be told about the story but I'll try to be really laconic. We have a newby young pirate named Luffy setting off on his adventure across the oceans to become the King of Pirates. Yes, it's really commonplace. But what's pulling you in on this grossly big adventure is Luffy getting new nakama and the\n          \n        wonderful experiences they come along with as a big family. My compatriot Cavafy's poem (written more than a century ago) describes Luffy's journey in a beautiful and exact way:\nAs you set out for Ithaka\nhope your road is a long one,\nfull of adventure, full of discovery.\nLaistrygonians, Cyclops,\nangry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:\nyou’ll never find things like that on your way\nas long as you keep your thoughts raised high,\nas long as a rare excitement\nstirs your spirit and your body.\nLaistrygonians, Cyclops, \nwild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them\nunless you bring them along inside your soul,\nunless your soul sets them up in front of you.\nHope your road is a long one.\nMay there be many summer mornings when,\nwith what pleasure, what joy,\nyou enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time:\nmay you stop at Phoenician trading stations\nto buy fine things,\nmother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,\nsensual perfume of every kind—\nas many sensual perfumes as you can;\nand may you visit many Egyptian cities\nto learn and go on learning from their scholars.\nKeep Ithaka always in your mind.\nArriving there is what you’re destined for.\nBut don’t hurry the journey at all.\nBetter if it lasts for years,\nso you’re old by the time you reach the island,\nwealthy with all you’ve gained on the way,\nnot expecting Ithaka to make you rich.\nIthaka gave you the marvelous journey.\nWithout her you wouldn’t have set out.\nShe has nothing left to give you now.\nAnd if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled\nyou.\nWise as you will have become, so full of experience,\nyou’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas\nmean.\nWORLD-BUILDING: 10 (pif x1.3)\nLuffy and his friends travel a long way through an enormous ocean with a major variety of strange and amazing islands, kingdoms and societies awaiting them. Each unique yet a part of a uniform whole. All these different places and societies broach many real-world issues, such as diversity, racism, political corruption and much more... And they are all tied together in a perfect way!\nART: 10 (pif x1)\nWell, the art (both in manga and anime) complete the whole with respect to the detailed story, as well as the anime version adds an enjoyable liveliness.\nCHARACTERS: 10 (pif x0.5)\nLuffy and his nakama make such a great company that I wish I could become one of them. Their bonds are strong enough to consider them a family and, in another way, their journey is rather a family adventure. One's dream is everyone's dream! Their nakama lives are more important than theirs! This is One Piece!\nAVERAGE: 10 (I want moreeee!)\nIn conclusion, I could type in front of my laptop's screen for hours but that would be much of a torture for the readers. If anyone reads this at all. :p :p :p\n        "},

That being said, as a shounen one piece is a really good series. It has fun adventure, interesting characters, a lot of world building. The best thing about one piece is how creative it is and how it is always fun to read. There are a lot of characters in the story but the author, Oda never forgets them and always manages to make them relevant in the story. There are even cover stories for multiple characters.\nUnique things about one piece:\n1. The art is creative\n2.\n          \n        The world building is immense \n3. Art is detailed\n4.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="               \n    Have you ever wondered why this series is so popular? Why the manga is rated so highly on so many websites that give ratings? How is this series still so popular even though it is already 20 years old? Have you ever wondered why the anime isn't rated as highly as the manga, apart from its sub-par animation? Why is One Piece so huge? If you ever wanted the answers to these questions, continue to read. \nI have been a fan of the series since 2005. Back then I was just 12 years old when I was first exposed to the anime of One Piece.\n          \n        My first thoughts were: \"What the fuck is this shit? A guy who can extend his body limbs? What is this is silly artstyle? What the hell?\"\nI was only exposed to shows like Dragonball Z, Digimon and Pokemon, among some others before. Then I discovered One Piece and as I had nothing better to do I watched the anime on the TV canal where it ran on. And I still follow the series today.\nNow, 12 years later, I have finished so many things in my life. I'm an adult. I earned my first money and I'm soon attending a University to study. I finished school a long while back. And in all this time I have read the manga as I transitioned from the anime to the manga at one point. Why am I still reading it?\nBecause and this is also the reason why One Piece is held so highly throughout the fans and manga community in general: \nOne Piece is one of these rare series that actually got better the longer they went on. You won't realize this by just \"reading\" it. You won't realize it by just reading the first 300 chapters. And you will never realize it if you decide to burst through pages at some points just because they feel rather boring to you. Oda's story-telling is simply masterful. There is no other way to describe it. He manages a consistent form of foreshadowing that you will not witness in any other manga or work of fiction in a very long time. Clocking up at 851 chapters at the moment, he has been carefully planting hints and foreshadowed events throughout the entire series. There are still so many people who don't realize this because they simply don't bother with it. In the beginning, it's not that clear, as the manga was relatively \"small\" in its start, back in 1997. The anime fails to adapt it correctly as it buries many things under annoying repetitions and fillers. It sometimes even contradicts with the content of the manga, pacing is horrible, it borrows sound design from DBZ and Toei doesn't even get the proportions of characters right. The manga however doesn't have these issues. Oda offers the best kind of writing in this regard. It can be compared to a movie that gives the audience the normal stuff like action, dialogue and other scenes in the foreground. But when you, as a viewer, decide to dig a bit deeper into it, examining dialogue a bit more or looking for hidden imagery in the background, you will be rewarded. It gives the whole movie a deeper meaning and it leads to a bigger picture. This is what Eichiro Oda does with One Piece. One Piece becomes this bigger picture, if you decide to look beyond the stuff in the foreground. What happens in general is, of course, important too and very good. But you will only realize the actual amount of depth of One Piece if you ever decide to create links between situations and scenes. Of course, the manga itself is huge even without that background stuff. But the additional planning and careful placement of hints and evidence adds an additional layer to everything that happens in One Piece. Things and events are foreshadowed, sometimes even hundreds of chapters before they occur while the main stuff happens in the front. And he has been doing it consistently in the past 20 years as the series has been made. Just search for \"One Piece  foreshadowing\" online and you will be flooded with confirmed theories, evidence and massive throwbacks in terms of hidden background details, imagery and hidden dialogue meanings in thousands of forums. This is One Piece. Things like Ace's tattoo that seemed to be a misspelling by the tattoo artist got a whole new meaning when we saw Sabo's pirate flag. Usopp's funny lies that he tells and the made up stories that he told Kaya actually became real as they happened in the story. Back then they were played for laughs but then, if you remember it or re-read the manga, it simply makes click. This is the foreshadowing that I'm talking about. And this is just the tip of the iceberg that One Piece offers. The world and depth it has is just humongous. This may sound very pretentious what I'm writing here but it's simply the truth. You don't have to look everything up online to make a connection but it does help. Of course you can make all these links by yourself, even if it takes a bit time. While other artists simply fill out background just for the sake of filling them out, Oda plans it. \nAnd don't imagine Oda being like: \"Oh, I will just put this thing here and then I will come back to it 600 chapters later\". This isn't what he does. What he actually does is, he creates characters and scenes in the way, that he can use them as a link point for a future reference or connection and then later he simply picks it up as he feels it as most appropriately. This is what he has been doing with characters, items, scenes, story moments and more throughout this entire time. Everything feels connected. Character re-appearances never feel forced, they all become logical. They actually feel like actual characters in an actual functioning world and they don’t just behave the way the plot demands them to like in many other manga. This is what sets One Piece apart from so many other shonen manga and this is one of the main reasons why it's held so high by fans. Some say: \"It's the humour\", other say: \"it's the action\". But these are subjective. The foreshadowing is an objective strength of One Piece and there isn't a single manga that can keep up with One Piece. And I love this aspect of it. And back then I didn’t even realize it. I just paid attention to the stuff in the foreground. And when I re-read everything back then and followed some discussions on online forums I was blown away about how much I have simply missed by not paying entirely attention. How is he (Oda) able to do it? Well, he simply devoted his entire life to the creation of the manga and he simply loves writing for it. Yes. He simply loves One Piece. It's that easy. One could argue: \"Oh, he is just after the money, it's the most successful manga series of all time after all\". Ask again: This is a man who has been working 90 hours (125 when he works on a movie) every week since 1997. Working conditions of mangakas are among the worst in the world but he takes the lead. His breaks only serve for further story writing and are never used for vacation and he only sleeps 3-4 hours a day. Since 1997. He doesn't have any time or room to spend his money on anything. I read every interview about him as I find him simply fascinating. This guy breathes the manga and the level of dedication to the manga is reflected by the quality of the manga. Even at its weakest moments, One Piece still stands higher than many other manga at their weakest times in terms. Oda's dedication is reflected in his art as well. Just look and compare the amount of detail that is put into panels and pages of One Piece with other manga. I adore his style and I know many think his style feels childish, silly and I used to think this too but the amount of work that he puts into his creatively made pages is impressive and I have great respect for him. Look up \"One Piece colorspreads\" to have an idea about it. And even in black and white it's just beautiful whenever he showcases his islands. And even the smallest panels are filled with rich background details. It's the embodiment of the joy in adventuring a mysterious world. \nThe series is unpredictable while retaining a basic formula but also offers a lot of variety. And the sense of awe. (Some spoilers here)\nFrom character design, to abilities and motivations. Every manga and artist behind it has a formula. Even writers like Stephen King have found their formula how to make their stories. Oda has a formula too. While being very focused and rather small compared to what happens currently, the beginning of One Piece already had these kinds of aspects of story that Oda would continuously improve upon and further flesh out. The great idea of Devil Fruits that offers an endless set of interesting villains and interesting abilities is just one of the great aspects of the series. \nThe formula boils down to this: The strawhats appear on an island, they are in awe as they don’t understand what is going on on this weird island. They find out the population has problems or is oppressed. They try to help them while maintaining their actual goals. They beat the arc antagonist in the end. Quite simple, isn’t it? One could say that Dressrosa is a re-skinned Alabasta formula and they are kind of right but Oda switches things up a lot throughout the series. While this formula is Oda‘s basic formula on how to create arcs, he divides it often to offer more variety. Sometimes the strawhats have to interfere in a civil war that is under control of a Warlord (Alabasta). Sometimes they have to do a rescue-mission as they suffer a betrayal (Enies Lobby), sometimes they have to fight a giant on a huge island-ship before the morning sun burns them alive (Thriller Bark), sometimes they have to take action when a racist person shoots down one of the Strawhats friends and their actions lead to the call of an Admiral and a force too big for them to handle. And even taking part in an All Out War where one of the characters suffers a major loss is in. Oda has his core formula but he switches things up so often that it barely feels stale. One of the aspects on why the series is unpredictable in its core content is that Oda doesn’t write for the next cliffhanger but always has the bigger picture in mind. He takes risks. And he pulls them through. One of these risks was the death of Portgas D. Ace, Luffy’s brother and a favorite among fans, despite not being a core character of the series. Until that point it was an unspoken rule that no characters actually die in the series. And then it happened and it was a shock but also brilliant writing as nobody expected it, with amazing build up. Oda pulls his risks through, opposed to many others who make big cliffhangers and then go back to what they have always been doing. And if anybody who has read the series ever wondered why Peru (the falcon guy from Alabasta) survived his sacrifice where he flew the bomb into the sky: Back then 9/11 happened in the USA and out of respect for the people that died that day, Oda let him live. Originally he was supposed to die. Additionally to all of this, the story of the series is written like a path from A to B. It always moves forward. There are many shows and manga where everything just happens in the same place but in One Piece the characters always move forward, giving the entire series a feeling of progress.\nAnother aspect for the unpredictability and Oda’s knowledge of his own series and his understanding for the characters is the understandable power level system in One Piece. There isn’t a character that can literally destroy planets. There isn‘t one that seems to be the strongest in the entire galaxy. Every character has their limit. And while the main characters, the strawhats, win the majority of their fights (they are the main characters after all), they still lose some fights. In the beginning we get introduced to Zoro, a skilled swordsman who seems to be almost on par with Luffy. Then later we meet Hawkeye, the man that Zoro wants to beat to become the best swordsman in the world. And he doesn’t stand a single chance. Hawkeye beats him with ease. We learn that the strawhats are not the strongest. Later we get to meet Aokiji, one of the Admirals and he singlehandedly beats the entire crew. Oda understands his characters and he knows it’s boring if the main characters win every single fight. It also takes away the excitement if it’s done like that. Not in One Piece. Luffy must have lost about 6 fights so far. The power level system is well done in terms that it offers unpredictability in guessing how strong a character is but also enough evidence to kind of know and learn about the strength of a character and their limits.  And one of the main aspects why the series still feels fresh is the amount of creativity that Oda has in terms of world and ability creation. There is a sense of awe as you read One Piece that is also reflected by the main characters reactions as they stumble upon creatively created islands with their own unique eco systems. My best comparison I can make is that this is a world that you want to fall into. Live in it. The best kind of fantasy worlds. Similar worlds that I have experienced in this level are the Harry Potter books and Lord of the Rings. Next point: the story and the world of One Piece.\nOda understands his characters, his series and his writing. And he looks upon our world as well.\nFrom the very first chapter, Oda has made the goal of the series clear. Finding One Piece. This is the ultimate goal and it still is, after 850 chapters. The world of One Piece is a huge, functional world, filled with so many diverse mysteries, islands, characters, all with different motivations and it could actually work in real life too. Oda understands them all. He has created over 800 characters that populate the series and they all feel distinct enough to not be mistaken for others and remarkable enough to at least remind you that you have seen the character before if they re-appear. While some people think that his artstyle is kind of silly, because characters look so vastly different, it helps with this aspect of creating so many characters and making them look very distinguished from each other in the long run.\nApart from the ultimate goal, he gives each of his main characters an ultimate goal as well. Luffy wants to become the pirate king, Zoro the best swordsman, Sanji wants to find the All-Blue (an ocean in which all kinds of sea creatures live) and the others have their „dreams\" as well. While character development is not the main focus of the series (Luffy still behaves a lot like he did in chapter 1) it is not completely absent and some characters like Zoro or Robin behave different than they did back then. Characterization is done well, you understand their motivations, their flashbacks are tragic while not feeling completely forced and they are well done and well implemented. Where One Piece also shines is the depiction of various themes and subjects that exist in our world as well. It deals with racism, slavery, drug-tests, oppression and even depression at one point. It does these themes so flawlessly and barely they feel out of place or forced. Like I said, the world in One Piece feels like an actual functioning world with all its problems that plague our world as well. Tyrannical warlords exist, children get used for drug tests, racism happens between humans and fishmen and vice versa, slavery is used upon those that are deemed as the lower race by those who think that they stand higher (Celestial Dragons). The thing is, Oda inserts these subjects into the series without making a huge fuss about it. He doesn’t necessarily write them in for us to hate those characters for the sake of hating them but he takes neutral points. Characters like the Celestial Dragons have actual reasons why they behave like that and you can actually understand them up to a certain point. This is something that many mangaka don’t understand when they create characters like that. We want to understand them at least slightly. In the end it’s a shonen manga and is aimed at 13-17 year old boys but the amount of subject tackling, depth it offers is simply impressive. And all of these things is part of something bigger. The bigger picture. At its core, The Dark Knight by Nolan is just an adaption of a comic book series that is created to the appeal of young people, as comics were very huge back then. But it offers entertainment and depth for both, young and adult people. The best kind of writing. Entertainment in the front. Depth in the background. \nThe Will of D., the ancient weapons, One Piece, the revolutionaries, the poneglyphs, the final island Raftel. There are many mysteries that still have to be answered and Oda has given many answers throughout the series while never doing it in a painful, obscure way as done with the sci-fi series Lost where, if you get the answer to something, five new questions pop up. Oda gives us the answers where it feels most appropriately. Because he doesn’t write a series for the next cliffhanger. He writes a story that feels connected and builds upon itself since chapter 1 and while I know that Oda’s original plan in 1997 was to work on it for 5 years, he has found the right ways to make the world bigger and create more interesting mysteries and turned One Piece rightfully in the best selling series in the world. And it deserves it. I hope my „essay\" here gave you the answers on why so many people rate it so highly. For the most part I gave objective answers in terms of planning, foreshadowing and world building that Oda has consistently created throughout the series. I never talked about the negative aspects of the series and to not make it even longer, I’ll keep it short as I only intended this review to be the answer to the question why One Piece is still so popular even after such a long time.\nThe negatives:\n-	Not enough pirate ship battles in a series about pirates\n-	Pacing can be an issue at times but barely gets a problem. Biggest pacing problem was the overly long Dressrosa arc but even then OP still held a good level of entertainment\n-	Some characters like Zoro behave different than back then and while it’s entirely understandable, I still prefer the old Zoro\n-	A few hiccups in terms story telling in the first half\n-	Some of the villains motivations are a bit lackluster\n-	Not enough female villains\n-       Some of the later female characters suffer from same-face shape syndrome but he has noticed it as well and offers now more variety.\nI hope you enjoyed my review. Thanks for reading. If you want additional thoughtful analysis of One Piece, look up SupereyepatchWolfs video \"The Appeal of One Piece\". It's a good watch.\n\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="               \n    One Piece : the manga I've never thought I would read but then it become one of my all time favorite and my number one priority read every week. It started out as funny and full of action kind of story and then when the story dive in deeper it's full foreshadowing and moral meaning that parallels our society these days. Just a good manga recipe for me. It's awesomely drawn, especially the background work. And one of the only manga that ever made me cry even after reading it a lot of time and that A LOT.  If you ever feel like 800+\n          \n        chapter is too much to read, just try it and you'll get hooked on it and you'll never regret reading it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="            \n    Usually, I don’t review anything that is still ongoing and that I haven’t dropped after a considerable number of episodes/chapters. After 857 chapters of One Piece however, I feel like I have formed a viable opinion. Also, I don’t know if I’m gonna live long enough to see the end.\nStory:\nOne Piece follows the story of Monkey D. Luffy on his way to become the pirate king (whatever that title implies), making friends and foes along the way as his crew grows in numbers, strength and notoriety. There is one thing that sets this manga apart from most other shounen titles however, and that’s the creativity\n          \n        of Eiichiro Oda. He knows exactly whether the story needs more drama right now or more comedy and the plot unfolds bit by bit, but only as much as necessary to keep interest. I mean, after 20 years we still have no idea what One Piece, the will of D or the lost history are, but we learned about other things along the way. But still, that would not be enough for most people, so why does One Piece not get boring? Well, one major factor is that \"Oda never forgets\". Remember that little comment from a character 12 years ago? That’s an important plot point now. That new character? First mentioned in 2000. Hey, isn’t that the one guy they beat up in chapter 319? He happens to be an important person on the island they just arrived on. A heavy continuity in a long running series usually alienates potential new readers, but here the lore is never too deep for newcomers so that they would feel left out. Another big plus is the setting. The crew travels from one island to the next, not knowing a thing about the different locations of the world (except maybe for Robin). Therefore, we get to see all kinds of different themes on the visited islands. From prehistoric settings to Egyptian deserts to islands in the sky or underwater, there is always something fresh, a new climate and a new culture, a friendly or hostile environment, you never know. Sure, you will hear people say \"One Piece jumped the shark with the XYZ arc\", but that’s normal for a manga this long. People either complain about how it changed or that it’s repetitive, you’ll never make everybody happy.\nExcept for the Simpsons, I think we can all agree that they have sucked for at least 10 years now.\n10/10\nArt:\nBack in 1997, One Piece looked unique. To some, it looked ugly, so it had a bit of trouble picking up readers. But all it took was a little time to get used to it. Still, Oda’s artstyle isn’t the best around, neither 20 years ago nor today. That’s not saying it looks like shit, not at all, but it seems as if he has trouble drawing a normal human being. He makes up for that with crazy character designs that only got more crazy as time went on. A big point of criticism in recent years have been the female bodies. Realistic females have never been a staple of anime or manga, but in One Piece they not only look unhealthy, but rather impossible. Their breasts are twice the size of their heads while their waists are merely as wide as a thumb. That goes beyond sexy and into uncanny valley territory. In total, Oda has good ideas but occasionally trouble to put it on paper.\n6/10\nCharacters:\nAt this point I would take a look at all characters that are somewhat important or worth mentioning individually, but if I did that for One Piece, I would need to write a goddamn book. With a series this long that tells a tale of traveling, naturally the character count will be in the multiple hundreds. And here’s the thing: Almost all of them are memorable and unique. While the story in itself may not be all that special for many, you will have a hard time arguing against the fact that the cast of One Piece is simply amazing. Not only do they all have their own distinct design (though females are starting to look more and more the same, sadly) but they also all get a different personality. After all, the fun thing about travelling is meeting many interesting people and that is what the Straw Hats are doing. Characters that are a bit more important to the story usually get plausible motivations, and even though their backstories aren’t  all deep stuff, it’s more than enough for a story of this kind. Also, as I mentioned earlier, Oda never forgets. Sometimes, you meet people more than once and the same happens in One Piece. Sometimes they used to be important but aren’t anymore, at times unimportant side characters get a major role, other times they are just as dangerous or useless as they’ve been the last time. In total, the characters embody the fun the story wants to spread among its readers and they stand as one of the best casts of a shounen manga that ever existed.\n10/10\nEnjoyment:\nWhat can I say that I haven’t already? One Piece is fun. It’s exciting at times, but always hilarious and it owns the shounen genre like no other work managed to do since. In terms of quality (and length) it has surpassed its spiritual predecessor Dragonball, so if you are a fan of that and somehow haven’t checked out One Piece yet, you totally should. While some weaker phases are inevitable, the weak parts of it are still far superior to those of works like Naruto or Bleach. Long story short, One Piece is a MUST for shounen lovers, but also worth at least checking out for anybody else.\n9/10\nOverall:\n8.75/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="          \n    This review will focus on the strengths in One Piece over other shonen manga and provide examples to support them, but less so on weaknesses in One Piece since they seem to be pretty obvious among the experienced manga readers. \nFirst of all, characters. One Piece provides a strong cast of main protagonists with emotional backstories and unique characteristics. Each member in the crew doesn't overlap each other in terms of personality, appearance and abilities. Now you may think that is a common trait in all popular shonen manga but there's something different about One Piece.\nThere's consistency with the characters. Oda doesn't randomly make punchlines\n          \n        with his characters. The punchline is usually related to one's backstory. Usopp tells lies because he wanted his mother and people in the village to be happy; Nami loves money because she once had to steal money to save her people; Chopper loves when people praise him and he can't hide the pleasure when he try to because he has very low self esteem and refuses to befriend with others due to his trauma. He believes in everything Usopp says because he lacks life experience; Brook keeps cracking jokes because he had to keep lightening himself before he went insane when everyone in his crew died.......etc. It offers so much nuance to the characters when Oda put these comedic moments here and there. \nDon't get me wrong. None of these character traits is exceptionally subtle. But when it comes to One Piece, it works incredibly well.\nIt is a manga with more or less the same main cast the cast only adds people but generally doesn't drop people. (If you don't count Vivi or Jinbei who didn't officially join.)  This provides One Piece with a strong advantage. Oda can give a lot of nuance to the characters. While they go through different adventures, they react a wide range of different ways. Whether it be a escort mission of a ordinary, warm-hearted princess to her own country, a fantastic journey to the sky island or a slump of the crew where people leave for the greater good or for a small quarrel, strawhats seem don't run out of ways to interact with each other and with their adventures. This makes the cast incredibly fun to read. Also, Oda adds new members to the crew to keep the character dynamics among the crew fresh and fun. His wacky way to portray the characters fit perfectly with the vibe of the story.\nThough One Piece suffers from a formulaic way to characterize new members by having everyone a tragic backstory in a flashback, the character development in the main story is interesting enough and their flashbacks are effective enough to make the characters work. \nNext, let's talk about the story. It's obvious that the main protagonists are supposed to be unstoppable. Every arc it's very clear that strawhats would beat the villains and the conflicts are going to be resolved at the end of the arc because the story is progressed by having strawhats travelling to different places and meet new people and opposing forces. The same villain won't stick around for a long time. But One Piece is less about who's gonna win and rather focuses more on how they inspire people they encounter to fight for their lives and dreams. Though every arc follows a formula of strawhats meeting new people, knowing their lives suffer, then fighting for them. Lots of arcs tell a different story with a different theme with alasbasta being an escort mission, Jaya being how should men fight for their dreams, skypiea being a romantic story between two men, Water Seven being a romantic story between comrades by the disobedience of the tyranny etc.\nThe story does repeat itself after time skip. All in all Oda is still a human being, he runs out of ideas.\nThe art is probably the weakest aspect for One Piece. While the fight scenes feel powerful, the way Oda design the panels lacks fluency. From time to time when there is too much stuff in the panel, the drawing feels messy. The color covers are really good but they aren't related to the story. \nOverall One Piece is a really exceptional manga for romantist who is looking for a story about friendship. \n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="           \n    First of all, this review will be written in spanish so, if you don't speak spanish, you can leave.\nOne Piece es un manga que claramente depende del lector para ser calificado. Para comenzar, voy a decir que One Piece fue el primer manga que leí, y que gracias a él estoy en el mundo de los mangas y animes. Tengan eso en cuenta dentro de mi review.\nA mi me encanta One Piece. Ya desde el principio nos muestra la magia del mangaka, Eiichiro Oda, dentro de todos los aspectos. La historia es increíble, no por lo que sucede, que también está muy bien pensado, sino\n          \n        por cómo se cuenta. Eiichiro Oda tiene una gran manera de contar la historia. Entrelaza todo lo que sucede, y puede ser que algo que no pareciera tan importante, termina siendo algo que no deberíamos haber dejado pasar. Eso sucede mucho en One Piece, puesto que Oda hace que algo suceda, y luego, cuando ya nos olvidamos de ello, lo vuelve a sacar mostrándonos todo lo que eso significa.\nTambién, la forma que tiene él de entender e identificarnos con los personajes es impresionante. Cómo nos muestra y enseña la historia de ellos, sus poderes, y hasta cómo los consiguieron, todo, tiene un significado en One Piece. Hasta los personajes secundarios tienen una historia impresionante que hace que nos identifiquemos con ellos.\nEstas son las mejores dos partes de One Piece en mi opinión, la historia y los persones. Pero One Piece tiene tanto para darnos que no creo que sea suficiente, con solo contarles esto.\nVoy a hablarles de un punto que en cierto punto es negativo, y esto es la longitud de One Piece.\nMucha gente dice que no quiere comenzar a leer el manga o a ver el anime de One Piece por su longitud, me ha pasado con muchos amigos. Pero, ¿Es que Oda alarga One Piece por gusto, o por necesidad?\nSon muchas las personas que dicen que Oda sigue alargando One Piece solo por el dinero, pero esto a mí me parece totalmente estúpido y no, no es porque sea fan de One Piece, sino porque las personas envidiosas no pensaron antes de decirlo.\nOda podría retirarse ahora, sin haber terminado One Piece, y podría vivir con lo que tiene por el resto de su vida. Y no se si lo saben, pero el ya ha tenido muchos problemas de salud, y aún así, duerme solo 3 horas para hacer el manga de One Piece. Está adelantado 3 capitulos del manga, y aunque hace todo esto, el manga de One Piece suele subirse todas las semanas menos una, en la que Oda me imagino que descansará, espero.\n¿A ustedes les parece que Oda lo hace solo por el dinero?\nPuede ser que el dinero sea necesario, todos lo necesitamos, pero con todo el sacrificio que Oda hace día a día, me parece más claro que el agua que Oda ama lo que hace, y también lo hace por nosotros, sus fans.\nPor eso, otro punto que me parece increíble de One Piece, es su creador.\nOne Piece es una maravilla de manga, por eso, a todo el que esté dudando de leerlo se lo digo fuerte y claro, ¡LEELO!\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="             \n    The King of Shonen manga One Piece is called and damn right it's. One Piece is really the epitome of modern Shonen manga alongside with Death Note and Hunter x Hunter. But with Death Note bad ending and Hunter x Hunter (please kill me) pace and moody story line, this manga is without doubt the best Shonen Manga alongside Dragon Ball and Fist of the North Star.\nThe biggest main point of One Piece is story. Simple yet powerful, it's simply the best main selling of the story. It's a story about boy trying to get his dream and although it's simple like that, it's full\n          \n        of human's feeling and so fleshed out to the point that we can say that they are alive at this point.\nThe art is a bit weird, but the background is astounding and really detail to the point there is a hidden character each chapter and it's really astounding.\nThe character is also likeable and the villain is complete jerk so you can hate it.\nSo overall this is fun manga and i really recommend it despite it's long story.\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="           \n    First of all, I started One Piece in 2014 after finishing Naruto which was the first Manga/Anime I got into. One Piece for me at first cartoonish as if I was watching a cartoon on a Saturday morning when I was a kid. It didn't have the serious Story line Naruto had at first or any cool aspects about it. The only thing  that kept me watching/reading One Piece was out of curiosity of what randomness was gonna happen next. I took it as a comedy series more than anything. But the more and more you read/watch it starts getting more serious and an\n          \n        actual story line sets in over time that lasts multiple arcs and possibly is the final story line of what One Piece is. A lot of people got hooked on One Piece during the first 40 episodes but for me it took me a long while, more like 400 episodes...and people always ask me why I still continued reading/watching after it took so long to get hooked...most people would of given up I assume. For me though I just continued out of being bored mixed with the funny stuff happening in the story.\n*****************SPOILERS BELOW*********************** \nWhat really finally got me hooked to One Piece was the moment after Thriller Bark when Kuma appears and Zoro takes all of Luffy's pain, I thought this was for sure the most intense moment so far for me watching/reading the series....and after that I really loved One Piece and started considering it better than Naruto, at that time I thought Naruto was amazing. But after I watched many other series I started seeing Naruto as pretty average. Anyway, now One Piece is my favorite manga and I'm caught up reading weekly and occasionally I re read a lot of arcs and a few chapters. I really enjoyed the Summit War saga which was the Sabaody, Amazon Lily, Impel Down, Marineford and the post War arcs... This stretch of Arcs are probably the climax of One Piece so far.\nNow the World Building in One Piece is the best in any manga and possibly any fictional work. There are so many Islands they have been to and so much World Building so often that it feels like One Piece is a real world. I love how Oda does the cover stories to show what a few other characters are up to and it makes it feel even more real cause it shows how other characters are doing their own thing while we follow the main cast too.\n        "},
