It was republished under the VIZ Graphic Novels imprint from July 6, 1995 to December 6, 1998, and again under the VIZ Action imprint from December 31, 2003 to March 1, 2005. Kodansha Comics took over the license and has been releasing the series digitally, and physically in hardcover deluxe editions since November 21, 2017 . The series was also published in Brazilian Portuguese by Jbc from May 2003 to November 2014, as well as in a number of other languages, including French, German, Finnish, Spanish, Italian, Dutch and Polish.Oscar winning director James Cameron was introduced to Gunnm by fellow director Guillermo del Toro, and subsequently purchased the rights to a film adaptation in 2000. Production was halted numerous times due to Cameron&#039;s commitment to other projects, until October 2015, when Cameron handed over the director position to Robert Rodriguez. Cameron will remain attached to the project as producer, with the film &mdash; titled Alita: Battle Angel &mdash; due on July 20, 2018.",

   "synopsis" : "The people and cyborgs of the Scrapyard live beneath the floating city of Tiphares, whose inhabitants dump their junk in the Scrapyard and rule above its inhabitants. One day Ido, a former Tipharean citizen and doctor specializing in cyborg repairs, finds the intact head of young cyborg-girl in a vast pile of scrap. He takes her in, gives her a body and the name Alita. Alita then discovers long forgotten fighting techniques hidden in her body and decides to become a hunter-warrior; a bounty collector employed by the factories of Tiphares. (Source: ANN)",
