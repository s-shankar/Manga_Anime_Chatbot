    xxxHolic is a series that ties in quite closely with Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles, but for the most part, you don't really need to read TRC in order to understand xxxHolic until you get to about volume 11 or 12. Once you get to that point, though, the two series get heavily intertwined with each other so it might be a good idea to read TRC, anyway, so you don't end up reading 100+ chapters in one go like I did in order to understand what was going on in xxxHolic...Even so, it's interesting just to see where the two plots meet and how one thing\
          \
        that happens in one story makes an impact on what happens in the other.\
The story begins quite simply, and for the first bit, the story arcs are somewhat episodic - Yuuko gets a customer, Watanuki gets involved, something happens, and the issue is resolved for better or for worse. At the same time, however, little by little, more is revealed about the big underlying plot and about each character. On the surface, everyone is one way but underneath, you find that there's much more to them than originally thought. And reading back on the older chapters, it's clear that the hints were all there. In typical CLAMP fashion, however, once something is revealed, it seems to be even more complicated and confusing than before, but gradually, things become untangled. Nevertheless, be prepared for some confusion.\
Once you get into the main storyline, the plot really shoots forward. There are still a couple pacing issues since, even when there's a big revelation, the story seems to revert back to another normal story arc like before. To me, anyway, it was a little jolting. However, the story is always interesting and you can really see how the story unfolds, slowly but surely, and it's interesting to see how each story arc changes the characters and allows them to mature - and it is this theme that I see recurring through each arc.\
Which brings me to the characters! xxxHolic enjoys a relatively small yet diverse cast. Here, you won't have to memorize two or three dozen names like in some other series. Instead, you have your main characters - Watanuki, Yuuko, and Doumeki - and then a handful of recurring characters. At first, they all seem to be somewhat stock-type characters, but like I said, there is more to them than originally thought, and as the story unfolds, they grow and mature. And interestingly, even Watanuki's positive traits are turned against him and he is forced to question his motives and his decisions, and he matured as a result. Ichihara Yuuko, the enigmatic Time-Space Witch, is perhaps one of CLAMP's best creations yet. She's as full of mysteries as she is of laughs, yet at the same time, she's realistic and human (seen more towards the later developments in the series). Despite being one of the most powerful characters in the CLAMP universe, she has her limits and vices like anyone else.\
The art, like any of CLAMP's works, is simple yet detailed. There are little to no screentones, and CLAMP makes good use of the contrast between black and white. Yet, at the same time, their designs are something to be marvelled at. Yuuko only has perhaps two outfits that she's worn more than once (always at key points of the story), and even Watanuki once notes when she's worn the same thing before. However, CLAMP does seem to be going through a tall-and-lanky-character phase (they've always had tall and thin characters, but they've recently gone into extremes if you compare it to their past works). It takes a bit of time to adjust to, but once you do, you can really appreciate the detail they put into everything.\
Overall, xxxHolic is one of my favourite series to date. Its themes are quite mature and there is much to be thought about and explored here. For example, one of the big questions raised early in the series was about fate and destiny - is our path laid out for us when we are born, or do we carve our own path? However, I'll leave the exloration of themes up to you. While the plot, at times, leaves something to be desired, it's still very enjoyable. To me, xxxHolic is like a deep pit of mysteries just waiting to be explored, and watching the mysteries - and their answers - unfold is somehow very satisfying. Yet, even as these mysteries are explored, more questions come up, leading the reader even further into the story.\
So, give it a try. I'd definitely recommend this story, especially if you've liked some of CLAMP's other works.\

    There are very few mangas I give a complete 10 out of 10 for, but if anything, xxxHOLiC excels even at that- I would have given it a 100 out of 10 if possible. It's that delightful and amazing.\
xxxHolic is a supernatural story about a young teenager named Watanuki Kimihiro who is troubled by his ability to see spirits and his bloodline's inheritance of drawing them close to him. One day, when running away from the usual spirits, he enters a mysterious looking building, only to find that the spirits have vanished, and that the building is inhabited by a \"witch\"- Yuuko Ichihara- who can\
          \
        grant wishes. Watanuki wishes to be left alone by the troublesome spirits, but in return, must work at Yuuko's shop- a job that is like no other. Soon Watanuki finds himself learning more about the supernatural world, other dimensions, and stumbles upon two characters from a different universe: Sakura and Syaoran....\
In a basic short: xxxHolic is not your typical run-of-the-mill manga. Exquisite in it's detailed art and subtle storytelling, this is manga at CLAMP's finest. Beginning with a series of \"events\" that Yuuko narrates and reveals something poignant about human nature and humanity and then slowly delving into Watanuki's mysteries and importance of being, it features excellent character depth and development. The chapters flow smoothly, going from one event to another without you really realizing it. It is slow at first, but in a good way, as it gives space for the characters to really develop and show their true colors. Eventually, it's crossovers with it's sister manga, Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles, lead to a main focus around 100 chapters into the manga. Yuuko's exhilarating beauty, seductive and omnipotent nature with young \"apprentice\" Watanuki is a delightful relationship. Also featuring is a small main cast, and a small minor cast, which allows the manga to focus exclusively on these characters with respect and care, rather than going for halfhearted attempts to cover a large cast. The best thing about xxxHolic is that it is specified for those who like thought-provoking, philosophical manga that manages to be visceral and accessible. It is that quality which allows it to retain a sense of maturity and coherence which draws the reader in, while being relatively simple in plot for a good portion of the story.\
Going onto specifics, however, the most wonderful aspect about this series, lies in its balance and characters. Roughly 1/3 of the manga devotes itself to episodic stories, each ending with a certain theme or saying, which may or not maybe as delightful as the viewer would wish to hear. It is here where we get a chockfull of comedy- from Watanuki's exaggerated emotions to Yuuko's fine palette and desire for food. It is here that unusually, we get the most amount of character development. Watanuki slowly transforms from a normal, spastic teenager to a more serious, refined and curious man. Yuuko herself changes- though more subtly, and as Watanuki begins to understand himself better, so do the people around him, and thus xxxHOLiC is really more of a character-based, introspective story than its sister, TRC, which is much more plot-based. \
The other 2/3 of the manga go into crossovers with the other series, which in a way is tragic, because in order to fully comprehend what's going on, you're going to inevitably have to read TRC or have a very good understanding of what's going on. That is one of the greatest weaknesses about this manga, one that has put many off from reading it, but let me say it now- don't let it get to you. If you prefer to read TRC - which has quite a long and convoluted plot - then that's totally fine, but the easiest way to understand these events is to simply read some general information about TRC (information that can  be obtained by going to WIkipedia, if you wish). It's also around this period that a dramatic shift in tone takes place- a very bold move, and honestly, what makes this manga fantastic in the first place. xxxHOLiC starts off as a comedy, but ends with a much darker atmosphere. It's here where Watanuki's character development really pays off, as we understand that in all things, not just wishes, just as there is a gain for something, there is also a price. Happiness is relative to everyone, and what may be one person's happiness may be another's misfortune. xxxHOLiC explores these themes and excellently, giving quite the realistic (but still with a hopeful edge to it) answers. \
Not only that, but lastly, xxxHOLiC is fantastic at giving the setting and characters life. No character feels completely flat and while some additional development could have been added, each character is different in their own way, and most importantly, the relationships between the characters are amazing. Each relationship shapes the character in a completely different way, and as Yuuko said herself- it are these ties that inevitably, make us want to wish, and make us human.\
I'm probably ranting at this point at how amazing xxxHOLiC really is, but it changed my entire perspective and philosophy on life, and not many things can do that. A delight that anyone should definitely read, xxxHolic will have you most likely, hooked at first sight. \

    xxxHolic is a pritty good manga and one of the masterpieces of Clamp. That said, everyone that is a fan of Clamp, should know and should be reading this manga. For the rest of the community of readers out there, like me, should give it a try to see if this manga is your taste, even if you dont like Tsubasa Chronicle. This manga shows a different perspective of Tsubasa Chronicle. Therefore, you will see characters showing up in this manga once in a while. \
The main story goes around a shop that grants your wish in exchange of something. And everyone that has a\
          \
        wish will be able to enter to this shop. It may look simple but its very complicated. Simple as, if your wish is big then the price will be huge. And complicated as, your wish not always goes as you plan it to and sometimes if you dont realize whats happening, then it will turn very ugly. Moreover, every wish comes with some consequence and responsibility. The manga starts slow trying to explain important aspects such as having a name, destiny, wishes, and change. The story gets very complicated as the story progress and it is easy to notice that \
If anyone have seen Clamp's manga, like Sakura cardcapter, then you already know how the art/drawing is. My interpretation of Clamp art is that they make it very elegant and sometimes way to elegant with flashy, puffy, good looking art. Of course, this is mainly for girls and teenagers.\
The characters are very well made. Each character is special and has its own qualities. Watanuki is the main character of this manga. Even though he doesnt know it, he is part of something big, as you may have notice from the clues and words from Yuuko that made you wonder whats happening behind the scenes.\
Overall, I should say that this manga is great, but I get the feeling that its to classic or its easy to predict the ending (maybe I am reading to much mangas this days).\
Oh, btw, if you really liked it, give a try at Tsubasa Chronicles to fully understand what is happening.\
I hope you enjoy it and fall in love with Yuuko, hahah...\

    The story focuses on Kimihiro Watanuki, a high school student who sees spirits. One day he wanders in a strange looking shop, where he finds the other main character, Yuko Ichihara, a witch.\
In order to fulfill his wish of not seeing spirits anymore, Yuko pretends to be payed. So Watanuki will work part-time at her shop, and this is where the fun part comes!\
The idea of a wish-fulfilling shop sounds very nice to me! Every wish that Yuko grants leads Watanuki to a little adventure, which usually involves other characters, a few spirits and a large dose of humor!\
It's a great mix of fantasy, comical\
          \
        and horror.\
The art is the so-called CLAMP new style. The characters appear to have a very long and skinny body.\
The main character, Watanuki, has a weird personality, and he can turn from wonderfully happy (when he talks to the girl he likes) to gloomy and depressed in a second. Nonetheless, this is very funny!\
Yuko has a fun personality too, she is good with her job but she usually drinks and laughs a lot... so yeah... she is cherish and Watanuki sometimes gets really angry with her and there are some fun gags.\
I had great fun reading xxxHolic, especially because I'm also reading Tsubasa and the stories are mixed, the characters are the same, and they sometimes communicate. So if I read Tsubasa and then I read xxxHolic, sometimes it's like reading each one two times (And I don't really mind, because I love them both!).\
So it may only be a matter of personal taste because I love CLAMP comics, but I suggest you to read xxxHolic.\

    Alright, I have read 15 chapters of this, and I think this is overhyped.\

It is rather confusing, and the MAIN storyline never goes on...\
The Art... OMG\
The characters are not in 'focus', it's extremely hard to distinguish them from the background. The characters looks like they have been cut & pasted, seeing the white outlines on them. The art is a bunch of 'pretty' scribbles, and is VERY chaotic. Reading this manga gives you eye-strain.\

    √ó√ó√óHolic follows Kimihiro Watanuki, a high school student tormented by the blessing/curse of seeing ayakashi, spiritual entities that seem to be attracted to him. The manga starts when he suddenly stumbles into Yuuko's exotic shop, and learns that his wish of rid himself of the ayakashi can be made reality, but he must work for Yuuko as payment.\
Story: 8/10\
It really fluctuates. On the psychological verge, Holic really does it function, balancing with an interesting use of mythology. As the series progresses, however, it decays to a further exploration of the bigger plot, which is far from interesting.\
Art: 8/10\
It's unfair saying Holic's art is uninteresting due\
          \
        to its style. One of the most unappealing points about Holic's art is, indeed, how padronized are the faces, but it's a problem most manga have, not CLAMP only.\
The long limbs really flow well with the manga general appareance. The art style, while with sharp lines, is really interesting and eerie, referencing to ukiyoe.\
The disposition of the elements on the frames, however, is quite random, and CLAMP could get a better use of semiotics on the work.\
Characters: 6/10\
Barely interesting. The characters actually get character development, which is a really nice point, but they don't change their actions at all. The secondary characters, however, are those that shine the most, with a nicely done approach to each one.\
Overall: 9/10\
Although being quite a flawed manga, it shows itself as a joyful reading, with a story that, while not exactly new, freshs itself by changing focuses as the chapters go by. Also, one of the main reasons one should give it a try is that it actually has a philosophical and psychological side, as opposite to many famous series that are described as such.\

    xxxHOLiC was one of the first manga that I ever read and it's probably one of the longest running manga series that I've ever finished. However, despite my nostalgia for it, my enjoyment while reading it was very mixed. xxxHOLiC wavers from being moderately enjoyable, to absolutely awesome, and finally to downright boring. \
xxxHOLiC can be split into 3-4 parts. First, xxxHOLiC reads like a supernatural mystery-of-the-week. These sections were fairly interesting and I know I loved certain specific chapters, but for supernatural mini-stories tangentially connected by the protagonist I'd rather read something like Nightmare Inspector which has a more serious tone than xxxHOLiC. \
Then\
          \
        the series skips to a very emotionally charged exploration of the main characters, making them feel more human and tightening their relationships. This to me was the pinnacle of the series because, before this, there really was no reason to care about these characters before because they were so flat and they couldn't be called much more than stereotypes; spastic weirdo, silent manly hero guy, love interest, sexy boss lady. They developed sympathetic characters traits and I found myself suddenly caring whether or not one of the main cast got hurt or not. \
The next 'part' of the series is actually an ongoing theme that the series includes, and it grinds the story to a screeching halt. It is one of the things about this series that the majority of the fans hate, and with good reason. The series tries to increasingly tie itself to Tsubasa, and it is very forced and it provides ....... little to nothing of value to the universe of xxxHOLiC. It's during these sequences that you have to force yourself to read these very long-winded boring sequences of Yuuko explaining to us how the two stories are 'connected.' Except... it's not all that connected. All of this can be easily removed and none of is actually has is direct or important influence on the main story of xxxHOLiC. \
As for the home stretch of the series, it makes a jarring return to the mystery-of-the-week format. It's obvious that the author started to see this series as a burden. There are a lot of pointless time-skips, and its the most jarring with the major ten-year time skip. Some main characters are forgotten and don't even show up for the last chapters. One character in particular gets so lazily written-out of the series that it was shocking.  And, in the end the series goes out with a whimper. No fanfare, no emotional intensity, just a lot of mundane talking in a very repetitious sequence. \
CLAMP's long-limbed characters are often the subject of much ridicule but I have to say that some of the designs, especially Yuuko's outfits and the chapter title cards, are lavish and quite pretty. The style of all the butterfly imagery to the simple flowing of smoke from a pipe is great eye-candy. That being said, panels can be lazily drawn like giving two-page spreads to pages full of black ink and/or a simplistic character portrait (especially near the end.) \
I do recommend this manga... but only the middle portion of it. Don't bother reading the ending, and (only if you have time to kill) read the beginning. \

    The story line for the most part is the same as the anime, with little things here and there that change which is rather normal for going from print to anime. A couple things though seem to of been changed. The first one is that Watanuki doesn‚Äôt feel like he is a total spas from what I have read. He seems a little more put together then the anime series. Yuko on the other hand seems to speak even more and says things that could probably go without saying like for instance, saying that Watanuki‚Äôs face looked mad when you could tell right from the\
          \
        picture that it did. Moro and Maro were not as annoying as in the anime (Or else, I could just decide weather or not I read their repeats of other‚Äôs words‚Ä¶) Yuko is even more cryptic in some of her answers then the anime, and rather seems to cut herself off once in a while. It really pisses me off that way. \
Now I do have a problem with how they put some of the story lines. In the anime, it seemed to be much better placed then in the books. There are times when they talk about Domeki even though we have pretty much never met him before but they talk about some rather special things about him. The animation seemed to be much better in bringing him into the story and explaining more about him. On contrary, when it came to Himawari, we got a lot more information even if it was cryptic in the manga instead of the anime.\
The artwork is rather striking, just like the anime. Unfortunately, it does have a couple of downsides. Because of how dark the manga is, the characters become masses of black blobs when we see them far away, and the details sort of fade off until you can‚Äôt tell who it is. The characters have the same problem as the animation where the bodies feel stretched and heads a little too small for the bodies. This does give the manga its on style away from most of clamps work even if it is a bit creepy. A downside to it having its on feeling is how stringy some of the characters hair seems to be. Yuko‚Äôs hair flies around like spiders legs or smoke even when there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much wind. It is always getting ‚Äòstuck‚Äô on something as well leaving fine lines on the page. Sometimes the images become too crowded with elaborate designs of smoke that although give the feeling of shop and some places around it a rather mystical setting, it takes away from much of the detail that should be shown or left blank. I normally don‚Äôt see any actual shading being done but when they do use it, its pretty much jet black blocks. There aren‚Äôt really any halftone patterns that I can see, and if there are, it‚Äôs very few using more of pen shading. There is also the little matter that they have no shin in there eyes, making them look a bit dead sometimes.\

    I get very tired of CLAMP.\
All of their offerings feel the same; insipid, juvenile and tedious.  Perfect fare for a toddler, but rather boring for an adult and as I've gotten older, I find myself disliking their works more and more.  xxxHolic has a little bit more of an interesting feel, but the male characters don't act like men and the enigmatic female makes me want to slap her.   \
Like other Clamp offerings, you never really learn what is going on in the story - you never really learn who the characters really are and why they are doing what they\
          \
        are doing.  For a while, that sort of story telling seems like the author is being mysterious, but by the end of the series, I was convinced they wrote like that way because THEY didn't know what was going on in their story either.\
Perhaps the story is quirky and odd enough someone would like it, but I didn't much like the stretched out art, the strange relationship with the wishy washy lead and his terse companion whom he seems to hate but who keeps saving him.  The relationships all seem hard to believe, stilted and strained - as if the authors don't have much experience with relationships in real life and so don't know how to write or draw them.  Of all the Clamp offerings I've suffered through this was possibly the least painful, but in retrospect, it's just so not worth wasting time reading or watching.  \

    This manga is so completely my cup of tea that I probably can't help but be a little biased in it's favor, but even so it's definitely something everyone should at least try reading. \
There are two things about xxxHolic that make it special, that make it stand out in my memory and have it latched permanently into my imagination. First, it's sad. I don't mean it's melodramatic and fraught with character deaths, its just has that perfectly melancholy tone. The enjoyable kind of sad you feel when you stare out your window on rainy days or when you remember happy times gone by. Not\
          \
        everything has to be grimdark to make you contemplate the tragedies of life or question the meaning of existence. \
Second is the stunning imagery. The story and characters are all interesting and well developed, but this manga would not even be half as good if it wasn't supported by CLAMP's beautiful art and haunting imagery. I'll just list a few of the most memorable- A sprawling red hydrangea bush whispering it's dark hidden secrets into the air. A pocket world of giant daffodils inside a well. A procession of yokai winding through the night like a river as they carry their lanterns to a great magical tree glowing in the distance. Walking down a dark street alone at night, passing a strange man with an umbrella...again, and again... and again. A boy opening a strange shop door to find a lounging woman, covered in her long black tresses and wreathed by smoke from her delicate pipe, smiling an enigmatic, slightly wicked, and slightly sad smile.\
In other words, if you love the mysterious, the strange, and the darker side of fantasy you can't do better than this. Add to that great characters that change and grow over the course of the story, an ending that will break your heart, and interesting tie ins to another great manga and why aren't you reading it? Go read it!\

    When I think about writing reviews for the works i've read/watched, it's waaay easier to talk about the ones that \"ok, this was really joyfull\" \"oh, such good art\"... Because when we talk about the one that is THE ONE for us, you may look like a crazy fangirl trying to say more than 'omg sahjashdjkah\". XD\
Let's try this! And I'm gonna start with: READ THIS, because not even in 1000 years, you gonna forget or regret.\
About the story:\
As any other one of the popular CLAMP 'classic' series, the plot has a lot of deep thoughts, meanings, things you carry for your personal life. Since\
          \
        from the start, they show you what kind of story this is going to be, full of funny moments, love and mystery. Even if this one isn't the last of Holic mangas, the put a good ending on. They created a point so the story can continue not getting all boring and becoming a circle of events. This is the kind of manga that, yeeears after you finished, if you look at the cover, you gonna become nostalgic and remember the good time you spent reading, and do it all over again.\
The only problem I see in the plot is regarding the points where the story connects with Tsubasa, for exemple. If you hadn't read Tsubasa, you may get lost, but reading Holic til the end, you still can get the story. They don't explain the connections from the start, and this is the only point where you can fell lost, because the other parts from the Holic world, lines that didn't get a tie in the first serie are explained after, and as there is a new serie going on, it's early to say \"but i didn't get that yet!\"\
About the art and characters:\
The art may not have shinning eyes, well structured bodies and flattering traces, nor realistic art and so. Yet, it matches so perfectly the atmosphere that the story gives, that it is almost surreal. Here's something important about the art: they are simple yet so detailed in the clothing and covers, that you need to spend such a long time to contemplate everything. It complements the mysterious feels that the store gives you. \
About the characters:\
When we talk about the characters, we NEED to talk about the bonds between Yuuko and Watanuki, and between Watanuki and Doumeki. They are really important for the story development and the plot itself, because, let's say, xxxHolic is about bonds. Even the characters that in any story would be the \"good for nothing good looking char\", here they have their special roles in the plot, none of them were waisted.\
___________________________\
Well, to finish this short review, I'll just complement what I said before: Read this story, not because it is CLAMP, not because it has a good scoring.\
Read it because it's good. This funny and amusing story explains to you the importance of every single thing that happens in life, the people we met, it teaches you the importance of making choices and that it will always bring something to your life, be it good or not.\

    xxxHolic ties in with the Tsubasa \" at various moments. When it does you often times wonder what is happening and get confused but as you continue reading you tend to pass it off as a side dish. xxxHolic is one of those mangas where you reach the end and you end up wanting to tear the book apart or rip out the screen because you don't want it to end. It has a great storyline and you really enjoy how it plays out. The characters will really get you into the story. The art is some of the best art i've seen and you\
          \
        enjoy every bit of the manga. When you get to the sad parts you feel sad and when you're supposed to feel happy and light you do.  Sometimes the characters will even get on your nerves depending on who you are. You end up loving all the characters, and when it all ends you feel content and even a little sad, but this is one of the best mangas you will ever find so read it! \

    xxxHOLiC is an everlasting manga. A manga that will be kept close to your heart because of the character's development and the amazing storyline.\
You will grow to love Watanuki and Yuuko including the supporting characters which plays a major role in their life. THis manga is perfect in every sense EXCEPT FOR...\
ITS ENDING. THe ending was unexpected, makes CLAMP look like they just finished it right there because they are bored of xxxHOLiC when there is so much development can be done. Too much potential stuck at a crappy ending.\
In numbers, the storyline is an 11/10 but the ending is 1/10. I am so disappointed\
          \
        and frustrated and angry because I feel for the characters, I cried for them and laugh with them and BAM, this is the end I get.\
The manga and anime doesn't differs much but the anime gives a more satisfying end although there are many questions (same goes to manga) that hasn't been answered.\
I wished I never read the manga for such a frustrating feeling. CLAMP, undo the spell and make it magical once again.\

    xxxHOLiC is, to this day, one of my favorites. I'm hesitant to rate it a 10, but I believe it deserves to have the highest rating possible.\
Story:\
The majority of the chapters of xxxHOLiC are contained in their own story, but all contribute to the reader's understanding of the characters and what may be unfolding around them. While sometimes this can bring down the story, overall it doesn't harm it as even things that appear to have no influence on the important events do help develop the characters in outstanding ways. Occasionally it may feel as if the short stories do drag the entire thing on\
          \
        too long, however, but the pace improves in the later chapters and saves itself from becoming too dull (though the short stories are, for the most part, rather interesting).\
It is worth stating, however, that the segments where TRC plays an important role feel out-of-place and shoehorned. They really shouldn't have been in this manga, or at least have been made to actually work with it instead of being forced in such a way.\
*Note: xxxHOLiC's events and a few of its characters have very close relations to other works by Clamp, most notably Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles, but one does not need to read these to understand the story. However, they are likely to give one a much better understanding of the universe surrounding this manga, so I recommend it.\
Characters:\
There is no long list of characters to consider in this, as xxxHOLiC focuses entirely on the plights of the four main characters. While they are quite one-dimensional in the beginning, they gradually get developed and grow, just as they should. The relationships especially get fleshed out and complicated ties are established between each character. By the end, no character is left undeveloped. \
     Despite this, I do have my grievances. The most prominent one is one other main character, seperate from the main four that consistently appear throughout the story, who appears in the later chapters. She does get to be quite important, but is phased out nearly right after she's established as a prominent character. She becomes a mere blip on the radar, and that is an issue that's never dealt with.\
Art:\
The art for xxxHOLiC is unconventional and stunning, in my opinion. Even the panelwork is great, and creates a wonderful balance page to page. While it may look odd in some scenes, mostly due to the appearance of the characters, its actually rather easy to get used to and becomes a pleasure to look at. I wouldn't compare it to artwork from other manga due to just how unconventional it is, but it shows great improvement from Clamp's absurdly proportioned characters in the early days.\
xxxHOLiC is commonly said to be Clamp's masterpiece, or at least one of them, and I agree. It was a memorable ride, and a beauty to behold. Definitely worth reading despite its length.",

 Shizuka Doumeki is Kimihiro Watanuki's classmate and considered a rival by Watanuki. He is part of the school's ky≈´d≈ç club and often participates (and tops) school competitions. Also because of his cool and calm composure he is very popular with the girls.\
 \
 He lives in a shrine owned by his late grandfather, a priest in which during his childhood told him a lot of stories about folklore and shinto practices. However, despite his heritage, Doumeki has a nearly null ability of seeing ghosts or spirits, though he can still exorcise them. He does seem to be able to feel spiritual \"pressure\" and have a vague sense of their presence. One spirit he did see was the Lady in the Park that Watanuki often visited.\
 \
 Doumeki has a pure or refreshing scent as noted by the Ame-Warashi. Kohane noted that Doumeki was a 'beautiful' or 'pretty' person, most likely referring to his spirit or aura. Naturally, Watanuki is bewildered (and rather agitated) by this. Doumeki cannot enter Yuuko's Store, the explanation why is later revealed on volume 8. His technique of exorcising spirits is by shooting them with an invisible arrow made of pure energy, as first revealed in volume 2.\
 \
 Originally Doumeki could not see the spirits/ghosts that Watanuki could see (like that of the oden shop owner and the Ghost Girl who haunted a scary home) but after he shared both his blood and half his eye with Watanuki he was able to eventually see and experience what Watanuki goes through.\
 Doumeki's personality is a total opposite of Watanuki's. He has a cool, calm and often sarcastic demeanor. He barely speaks unless explaining folklore or asking Watanuki for impossible bento lunches (such as asking for food that is out of season or hard to find). He also has a deadpan sense of humor that is often dark and somewhat fatalistic. Much to the annoyance of Watanuki he seems to pop up everywhere, especially when Watanuki gets a chance to be with Himawari. He often replies in a one word phrase like \"Hn\" or \"Oh\". He is also very observant, and even though he does not show it he seems to be very protective of Watanuki, such as in Volume 5 where he stood for hours in the rain to make sure Watanuki was safe and in Volume 6 during the incident with the spirit in the park. Volume 9 of the manga through Doumeki's New Years dream we find out he looks like his late grandfather Haruka. His grandfather also knows more about Doumeki's past, and bears an uncanny resemblance to his grandson (though Watanuki points out that Haruka smiles much more).\

 Despite this immature and free-spirited attitude, Y≈´ko has been known to be sage-like and serious when the time calls for it. Y≈´ko seems to know the true hitsuzen that Watanuki will follow, and has often offered cryptic messages to warn him of impending danger or a folk tale that he should take a bit more seriously.

 Watanuki is a high school student whose life has been a rather difficult one&mdash;not only have both his parents died, forcing him to live alone, but he is plagued daily by spirits that only he can see (both the ability to see them and the cause of their attacks are evidently heritable traits&mdash;apparently Watanuki's blood smells very delicious to spirits). \
 \
 One day, Watanuki enters into an agreement with Yuuko to work for her in exchange for the fulfillment of his wish&ndash;to never see spirits again. This marks the beginning of Watanuki's very involved part-time job, a fated meeting with a certain quartet from Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, and so many \"chance\" happenings which occur not out of coincidence, but \"hitsuzen\".\
 \
 Watanuki is known for a having both a volatile and caring nature to him. Depending upon the person he talks to, his emotions tend to be overly exaggerated. With Himawari he throws himself into the air accompanied by hearts and a \"Himawari-chaaaaan!!\" squeal. With Domeki, he almost always expresses irritation with various facial expressions, screaming, and arm motions that reminds Himawari of an angry cat. With the exception of these two and Y≈´ko, Watanuki tends to address everyone around him with formality and kindness.\
 \
 One of Watanuki's greater problems, especially early on in the manga, is his lack of self-worth. He found absolutely no value in himself and would often use himself to aid another, even if his life were at stake. \
 \
 An example of this is when he willingly gives up his right eye to the Spider's Grudge to save Domeki's, without considering how much his decision might hurt Domeki. He's forced to face up to this problem when trying to save the Zashiki-Warashi from the Joro-Gumo, when the spider matron harshly chastises him for his lack of consideration for both his own self and those who cared about him. Faced with the facts of how much he's hurt those around him, Watanuki begins to see some value in himself. He will still often use himself to save others, but now he is mindful of just how much his actions hurt other people.\
 Life for Watanuki changes significantly once he starts working as Yuuko's assistant (rather, her very indignant indentured servant) who not only cooks (wonderfully), cleans (diligently), and complains (constantly), but finds himself performing very odd jobs and learning more about the occult. \

The reason for his death hasn't been mentioned yet. Haruka looks strikingly like D≈çmeki, but he has a somewhat more cheerful and outgoing personality than his grandson. He seems to have taught Shizuka a lot of stories regarding folklore, mythology and shrine practices. He has also an immense library that now D≈çmeki uses and keeps. \
 As the priest of that shrine, he had the power to exorcise spirits and see them as well, an ability passed on to D≈çmeki (although D≈çmeki could not see spirits). His style of exorcising spirits, like D≈çmeki, was shooting a bow and arrow made of chi. When Y≈´ko saw the wards Haruka had made for the library she indicated that they were of high quality, attesting to his skill and knowledge of the occult.\
 \
 Volume 9 of the manga marks his first appearance: in a dream provided by the Yumenai's balloons, which were originally Haruka's. He acts like a guide to Watanuki as Y≈´ko does, asking him why he really likes Himawari and pointing out that since he met Himawari, things have gone bad for him, as well as asking why he found Shizuka D≈çmeki irritating. When Watanuki fell from the school window, he entered a dream-like state in his near death condition. It was Haruka who crossed into this dream-like state and brought Watanuki back to consciousness.\
 \
 Watanuki continues to see Haruka in his dreams. In chapter 127 Haruka has been shown to have the power to not only enter Watanuki's dreams, but can also bring him \"across\" to another person's dream. He acts as a guide to him as well in explaining things or warning him of danger like the time Kohane's mother splashed Watanuki with hot water. His statement that this is because all dreams are \"connected\" and thus it is possible to travel between dreams, is an idea that has been shown in other CLAMP works, notably in X. Haruka's ability to \"cross\" dreams and perhaps using them to sense certain knowledge is one that is characteristic of the yumemi from X. \

      description = "Fai's introduction is in chapter two of the manga, in which he is shown sealing away King Ashura of Celes country at the bottom of a pool. He transforms his creation Chii (originally from Chobits) into a net-like shield, instructing her to alert him if King Ashura should awake. He then uses his magic to transport himself through dimensions, to the shop of the Space-Time Witch, Yuuko Ichihara. \
 Out of his travel companions, Fai&rsquo;s motives for joining the group are the least clear. He was the only one to arrive at Yuuko's shop purposefully, by use of his own means. His wish was to never return to Celes country, but as the price for this would have been too great, he travels worlds with the group instead. He fears King Ashura&rsquo;s awakening, believing King Ashura will chase him through different worlds. The basis for this fear is as yet unknown. \
 \
 According to CLAMP, the correct pronunciation of his name would rhyme with \"eye\", so instead of spelling it like \"Fay\", as they intended, they thought that this would confuse readers. Thus, they stuck with the spelling of \"Fai\".\
 \
 <b>Spoiler:</b>\
 \"When Fai's past is finally revealed, it is shown that \"Fai\" is actually named Yuui, and his twin brother is the real Fai. In Valeria Country, though the birth of the second prince's son was highly anticipated, the birth of twins was considered to be a bad omen. Shortly after their birth, the second prince died, and their mother committed suicide out of guilt for giving birth to them. In addition, the country suffered many misfortunes, and the twins, when combined, bore powerful magic that rivaled that of the current king.\
 \
 The king decided that making them unhappy was the only way to break the \"curse\", and since both refused to kill each other, they were locked up separately in a place where magic is ineffective and time does not flow: a tower residing in a deep valley; Fai was imprisoned atop the tower, and Yuui was confined at the base of the tower. Both were condemned to stay there \"until the world's destruction.\"\
 \
 Despite their unhappiness, the number of bodies dumped into the base of the tower began to grow. Yuui tried endlessly to climb up towards Fai, so they could escape, but he did not succeed. Eventually, the king became insane, and he executed every person in the country, save Yuui and Fai. He then jumped into the valley himself and committing suicide in front of a horrified Yuui, reminding him that their birth was the reason for the country's misfortune, and that they would now \"pay for that sin\" by being the only people alive in Valeria.\
 \
 Eventually, Fei Wong Reed appeared from another world, and offered to free one of them. Fai chose to save Yuui, resulting in Fai being thrown from the tower to his death. Fei Wong then convinced Yuui that he is at fault of his brother's death and that Fai might be revived, allowing Fei Wong to use Yuui's guilt in order to turn him into his pawn. In order to bring his twin back to life, Yuui allowed Fei Wong to bestow two curses upon him, one of which was removed from Yuui's memory. Fei Wong then told Yuui that someone would free him from the valley, and that he would have to go on a journey, protecting \"a princess\" (Sakura), and killing any obstacles along the way. Fei Wong then tells Yuui that when he finds a magical feather, he should put it into Fai's body to prevent it from rotting, and that he should begin his journey when he finds a second feather, which he should give to Sakura.\
 \
 Later, King Ashura came to Valeria from another world in order to retrieve Yuui and took him to Celes. When Ashura asked what Yuui's name was, Yuui said it was \"Fai\". Ashura later gave Fai the last name \"Fluorite\", the name of a precious talisman mineral, and he eventually earned the title 'D', given to the highest magician in Celes. And thus, Yuui became the protagonist \"Fai D. Flourite\". He found his two feathers while helping villagers during an avalanche, and decided to use one to create a person, Chii, in his mother's image, Chii.\
 \
 Ashura eventually tutored Fai in magic and comforted him whenever he felt unable to overcome his dark past. When Fai discovered that he could only learn \"magic that kills people\", Ashura told him that his smile held the ability to heal others. In exchange for everything that he had done for him, Ashura asked Fai to promise that he would eliminate anyone who threatened Celes.\
 \
 Due Fai's first curse, Ashura traced a magical seal on Fai's body in the form of a Phoenix tattoo, which suppressed his powers from growing any further, and though Fai protested, Ashura told him that Fai's first curse would break after it was fulfilled once, and he wanted to be the one that Fai would kill. Ashura then erased what he had told him from Fai's memory.\
 \
 Several years later, a mysterious and deadly monster began to kill Celes's innocent civilians. Fai swore to defeat the beast, but found out that Ashura was the monster. Fai, at first, blamed himself for what happened to Ashura, thinking that \"the curse of the twins\" was what had caused Ashura to kill, but Ashura told him that his magic grows when he kills, and that he always knew that he would become a murderer, even though he was not sure why. Fai realized that Ashura had brought him under his care for the sole purpose of killing him when he reached this state. Unable to bring himself to kill Ashura, Fai cast a spell on him, putting him into a deep sleep. However, no magic spell was permanent, so the king would eventually awaken. In order to avoid having to face Ashura when he woke, Fai used his magic to teleport himself to the Dimensional Witch, where he began his journey.\

In his thoughts, he has indicated that he and Kei lived a secluded life, effectively trapped on a single property where no other children lived, and also indicates that neither he nor Kei ever finished their schooling even at the elementary level. \
 At the very start of the series, Kazahaya is found lying in the snow, having apparently run away from his former home and very nearly freezing to death, before being found by Rikuo, who brings him back to the Green Drugstore. Since then, he has always been trying to earn money so that he might live alone, which is the main reason why he accepts the 'extra' jobs offered by Kakei. He has a supernatural power which is something like psychometry in that he can see the \"memories\" of things or persons when he touches them; he may also possess some emphatic ability as he seems capable of absorbing emotions as well as memories, and on at least one occasion has channeled the present visual perspective of another person (Rikuo).\
 \
 While at times he may seem rather helpless, or at least hopelessly naive, he has many skills and abilities which make him highly capable in certain tasks. Specifically, some of his behaviors and abilities seem remarkably similar to a cat, including a heightened sense of smell and vision, several demonstrations of cat-like agility and speed, and his tendency to look like an angry kitten when upset.\
 \
 Kazahaya is noted to be 17 at the start of the series, and is smaller, slimmer and has a much more feminine appearance than Rikuo, to the point that he can be accurately described as \"pretty.\" He gets emotional easily, and frequently plays into Rikuo's hands when teased due to his quick temper.\

      firstname = "Kurogane",
      description = "Kurogane is serious and extremely perceptive, being able to quickly discern Syaoran's fighting ability (along with Syaoran's blind right eye) as well as Fai D. Flourite's true nature and fighting capabilities. While he seems rather irreverent, he is also very loyal. He is likely the most experienced fighter in the group and wiser than he appears. He becomes Syaoran's sword fighting teacher, presenting the boy with the same philosophy he believes in: a sword is used to cut only when needed and not used to cut anything if it is not necessary. While serious, Kurogane is very easily irked by others, especially by Mokona Modoki and Fai, who keep calling him ridiculously cutesy nicknames such as \"Kuro-puu\", \"Kuro-wan-wan\" or \"Kuro-rin\". However abrasive and ruthless Kurogane may seem, he has a compassionate nature and a desire to protect. An example of this would be how Kurogane continually questions Fai on his actions and character, and lets the wizard know that he should stop hanging onto his past and embrace the future with his new companions. Or, Kurogane's own statement that \"If someone wants to take away the ones I want to protect, I'll kill them too\". \
 His compassion and protective nature is especially clear when his actions early in the series are compared to his actions later on. He had straight out told Syaoran in their first world, the Hanshin Republic, that the quest has nothing at all to do with him. In the next world they visit (Koryo Country) however, Kurogane offers his services to help raid the castle of an evil lord, and stays behind in battle to let Syaoran go on ahead. Eventually, he risks a loss in strength to avenge his comrades' \"death\" (they were of course still alive) by defeating their killer in battle. It is noted that after he finds out Fai and Syaoran are still alive, he lost his passion for the battle.\
 \
 He obtained a new sword in Outo called the Souhi (Blue Ice or Pale Ice) and taught Syaoran the skills of sword fighting and sensing attacks from the left. \
 \
 At the beginning of the story, Kurogane told Syaoran that he would not help in finding Sakura's feathers, since it was not related to him. However, he ended up aiding Syaoran and the others anyway, teaching Syaoran how to fight and use a sword as well.\
 \
 In the Tokyo arc, Kurogane was involved in a short fight with Kamui. Later, he wished to Yuuko to save Fai's life, after Fai's eye was ripped out by the clone Syaoran. Through an arrangement by Yuuko, Kurogane and Kamui mixed their blood and forced Fai to drink it. Fai thus became a vampire and survived. Since it was not Fai's wish to live but Kurogane's, Fai can only take blood from Kurogane. Fai painfully refrained from calling Kurogane nicknames from then on, in an effort to distance himself from Kurogane.\
 \
 Kurogane noticed that Fai and Sakura were up to something in the Infinity world, but did not say anything. After Sakura left, however, he finally spoke up, refusing to let Fai give up his eyesight to go to Celes. Kurogane told Yuuko they would all pay a fourth of the price to go save Sakura's body from Celes.\
 \
 In the latter parts of Volume 20, Ashura used his magic to show Syaoran, Kurogane, and Mokona visions of Fai's tragic past. This caused an angry and betrayed Kurogane to unsheathe his sword and attack Ashura and Fai. He and Fai fought a fierce battle that devastated the room around them. In the mayhem, Kurogane destroyed the body of Fai's twin and managed to overpower Fai in that moment of weakness, saying to the overpowered Fai something along the lines of \"I thought I already told you I don't have anything to do with your past\". Kurogane then turned on Ashura, demanding to know why he'd shown them Fai's memories. The king responded by saying that he only wanted Fai to \"grant his wish\" and kill him. Ashura then launched vicious spells against Fai, Kurogane, Syaoran, Mokona, and a defenseless Sakura's body in order to force Fai's hand. In the chaos that followed, one of the massive ice stagamites that he conjured pierced Kurogane through his lower right side.\
 \
 Korogane is then apparently spared the damage due to the protective spell that placed upon him before leaving Japan by Tomoyo. He then stabs King Ashura, and after the King's death the group is seen possibly leaving for the next world.\
 \
 Fai's second curse caused him to suck up the world of Ceres; Fai tries to transport Kurogane and the others out of the small sphere that Ceres has become, but he doesn't have enough magic to do so. He only succeeds in transporting Syaoran, Sakura, and Mokona. Then Mokona's earring (a magical tool made by Yuuko) was able to drill a hole into the sphere, but only one person could pass through. When Fai told Kurogane to leave him, Kurogane cut off his left arm and left it and Souhi as a sacrifice and rescued Fai.\
 \
 In chapter 167, Kurogane wakes up and finds himself back in his country, with Princess Tomoyo by his bed. Tomoyo welcomes Kurogane home and asks him if he has found out the true meaning of strength, to which he replies that he doesn't know. However, he explains to Tomoyo that he doesn't regret giving up his arm to take Fai with him, and tells her that he knows that some things can't be protected only by (physical) strength. This surprises Tomoyo, but she acknowledges that Kurogane has definitely realized the true meaning of strength. She then lets Fai into Kurogane's room. Kurogane seems genuinely pleased to see Fai, while Fai doesn't express much emotion, until suddenly he punches Kurogane. Kurogane doesn't quite react to this, far too startled. Fai then smiles at him, saying \"This is payback, Kuro-sama.\" The smile seems like the real thing, and Fai has gone back to using suffixes on Kurogane's name. Kurogane grins back, promising to beat Fai up for that.\
 \
 In chapter 169, Kurogane is approached by Fuuma who has come to Nihon Country with an artificial arm from Piffle Country, however Kurogane refuses the arm by saying that he \"will not pay anything to that witch for it.\" Fai replies by saying that he had agreed to pay the price while he slept, and gives up the last of his magic. In the second to last page of 169, Kurogane is seen with the arm attached, but claims that it \"feels weird.\"\
 In Horitsuba Gakuen, he is the PE teacher.\

 Syaoran Name:\
 Syaoran's name is Chinese in origin, commonly romanized from Chinese as Xiaolang. His given name, Syaoran (Â∞èÁãº), in both Chinese and Japanese, means \"little wolf\". His last name, Li (Êùé), is a common Chinese surname, meaning \"plum\". In Korea and occasionally in Taiwan and Hong Kong, it is romanized as Lee.\
 \
 <b>Manga Spoilers:</b>\
 In fact, this Syaoran is the original while the Syaoran at Sakura's side is only a clone that Fei Wong Reed created. This Syaoran is of Clow Reed's bloodline and can thus use magic. He gave his eye and with it half of his heart to his clone to stop Fei Wong's plan temporarily. He was depicted as a villain, occasionally controlling the protagonist's movements, until it was discovered that the protagonist Syaoran is his clone.\
 \
 Syaoran is the son of Clone Syaoran and Clone Sakura (who were reincarnated in the another world). As a child, Syaoran was sent to Clow Country by his mother and father for seven days, because he was \"needed\". After a week with Sakura, he decides to remain in the country with Sakura. She falls under attack, and Syaoran hesitates to save her, which causes her to have a curse cast upon her that willl eventually kill her. Seven years after Syaoran's arrival, this curse takes full effect, and Syaoran hastily wishes that he could turn back time to the day he failed to protect her. Fei Wong Reed appears to grant his wish, exacting his freedom and time as a price, also creating \"replacement being\" for him, Watanuki. Syaoran becomes a prisoner of Fei Wong, his time rewound to seven years earlier, until the day the seal on the Clone's eye is broken.\
 \
 This Syaoran is able to summon the sword used by his father, which was passed down to him along with the alias \"Syaoran\". His real name is unknown. He uses the same spells as his father, including the devastating lighting based attack 'Raitei Shourai'.\
 \
 His real name is Tsubasa, as revealed at the end of the manga.  This is the same as Real Sakura's name.\

 In Horitsuba Gakuen, he is Syaoran's twin brother called Syaoron („Ç∑„É£„Ç™„É≠„É≥, Â∞èÈæç).\

 This is later revealed to be a euphemism for bringing back the dead. He does not care on how much blood has to be shed to get that power; those he has killed (or arranged to be killed) include Kurogane's mother, Xing Huo and the real Fai. His true objective is not to obtain Sakura's feathers; rather, the scattering Sakura's memories was to provide a motive that would force her to travel between dimensions to recover them and attain the physical memories Sakura gains through her powers as she visits various dimensions. Therefore the scattering of memories and having the TRC trio accompany Sakura on her journey was a pre-planned situation created by Fei Wong in order for him to attain his wish, which apparently is to revive someone from the dead.

Born of an English father and a Chinese mother, Clow created a new type of magic that blended both Eastern and Western magical elements. His plan was to hand down the magic to people who would use and protect it while meeting all of the qualifications, however few people could learn his brand of magic. The character of Clow is only seen in flash backs, as he has long been dead before the series starts. Few details are revealed about his character, personality, or life. \
 When Clow knew he was about to die, he chose his then unborn descendent, Sakura Kinomoto, to become the new guardian of the cards and the new master of Yue and Cerberus. Clow's magical ability allowed him to foresee most of the future and plan many of the situations that would enable Sakura to succeed in taking full possession of the Clow Cards. He also deliberately made the sealing wand for the cards pink, reflecting that its future user would be a young girl. He also split his soul into two reincarnations, Eriol Hiiragizawa who had all of his memories and magic he possessed, and Fujitaka Kinomoto, Sakura's father.\

 \
 At the start of the series in both manga and anime, Sakura is the princess of the Kingdom of Clow who has feelings for Syaoran, her childhood friend.\
 \
 When she is about to confess her feelings, a mysterious force causes her own dormant magical powers to manifest in the form of feathered wings. When her feathers are scattered across time and space, Syaoran vows to recover all of them because each feather represents a memory Sakura has had since birth and are connected to her heart; without the feathers, she will die.\
 \
 Fei-Wong Reed (the mysterious villain in the series) reflects on the ability of people like the High Priest Yukito, Princess Tomoyo of Nihon, and Y≈´ko to cross dimensions and comments that the power concealed within Sakura and the ruins in Clow Country surpasses them all.\
 \
 In order to cross dimensions, Sakura must pay Y≈´ko the thing most important to her and she pays Y≈´ko in an indirect way but her price is pretty much the same as Syaoran - her memories of him. When she awakes in the Hanshin Republic the first person she sees is Syaoran, but she does not remember anything about him, asking \"Who are you?\"\
 \
 At times, such as in ≈åuto, Sakura comes extremely close to remembering Syaoran but it is quickly erased once more from her memory. Syaoran, having known this would happen previously, will never tell her anything about their previous relationship. At most, all Sakura knows about Syaoran is what she has relearned from the adventures together with Mokona, Fai, and Kurogane, although she knows she knew him previously and he was very important to her. It is also clear that she is falling in love with him once more.\
 \
 Sakura possesses unnaturally good luck; both Chun Hyang and Y≈´ko call her \"a favored daughter of the gods\". This is what allowed her to travel dimensions safely until Y≈´ko asks for her good luck as a price. According to Yukito and Syaoran, Sakura also has the ability to \"hear\" the voices of those who cannot be heard, such as spirits of nature, and to see ghosts. Such as the time in the Country of Jade, she can see Princess Emeraude while others couldn't. She can also see the future in visions, though this ability is unreliable and nothing she has control over.\
 \
 Sakura's personality is passive and weary, exhausted from her loss of memories. However as the series goes on, she becomes more stronger and independent. Syaoran states, even though she's lost most of her memories, she'll never change. She helps the group whenever she can, whether it's washing dishes or saving their lives.\
 \
 However, later in the manga, her personality undergoes a change after the clone Syaoran leaves her. As she voices to  Fai, no matter how identical the two Syaorans may be, the real Syaoran is still not the one she knows. Subsequent chapters show Sakura with a much darker personality, accompanied with gothic clothing.\
 \
 In the Infinity Arc, the group spent a few months fighting in a tournament, supposedly wanting to use the prize money to restore a world the clone Syaoran destroyed. However, the truth is that she was after the real prize - a robot (who is identical to Freya from Chobits) who can let one person and one person alone travel across dimensions.\
 \
 It is later revealed that Fai is under a curse that forces him to kill if he ever meets a person that is stronger than him. And in volume one, you can see that Y≈´ko was not hit by the rain, nor did she touch any of the people directly; this was because she was in another dimension to prevent Fai's curse from being activated. But when Sakura receives two feathers in the Infinity Arc, she was made stronger than Fai's halved magic and so he stabbed her, seemingly possessed. Sakura had a vision that after killing her, he would go insane and kill everyone else, eventually committing suicide, but she used the robot to transport her soul to a dream world, thus saving herself and stopping Fai from going insane.\
 \
 Later, it's revealed that she was not the original target of the curse, as the real Syaoran was. This is explained further in her appearance in xxxHolic; she changed the future so that Syaoran would not be killed. As she explains to Watanuki (Xxxholic chapter 140), her coldness to the real Syaoran was because she was trying to follow the dream as close as possible up to that near fatal event. It's later learned that Sakura can still be saved. The two places where her body and her soul went contains two feathers. Her soul went to the world of dreams, where it will be aided by the other Syaoran. So the real Syaoran, Fai, Mokona and Kurogane went to Celes Country to rescue the body of Sakura, as Y≈´ko told them it's the body they should rescue first, then the soul.\
 \
 At the end of the manga, her soul is eventually killed by the clone Syaoran, but just before her death, she reveals that she is a clone of the real Sakura. Her purpose was to map out other dimensions for Fei Wang, who created her, by finding the feathers. She is reincarnated in the original Sakura's body in the past, with her memories intact by Y≈´ko, along with the clone Syaoran. In this life she is friends with Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu, of the Magic Knights. Syaoran and Sakura eventually meet and give birth to a boy, who turns out to be the original Syaoran.  They raise him until it is time for him to begin the events of the series, and then they are sealed in a glass tube in order to await the time where Reed attempts to shatter reality. Sakura and Syaoran, after breaking free from the tube, cleanse the feathers, but both ultimately disappear after Kurogane kills Fei Wong, leaving behind only a feather which Sakura's original absorbs.\

At the end of the manga, Syaoran eventually turns against his creator and aids the original Syaoran in trying to save Sakura; however, Fei Wong kills Syaoran. Syaoran is reborn in another world, along with Clone Sakura, and he becomes his original's father. He and Sakura raise the original Syaoran until they send him to Clow Country to meet with his destined person, afterwards sealing themselves inside the glass tube. Sakura and Syaoran, after breaking free from the tube, cleanse the feathers, but both ultimately disappear after Kurogane kills Fei Wong, leaving behind only a feather which Syaoran's original absorbs.\

 Zashiki-warashi are prone to mischievous thoughts, though this one is actually quite shy and sweet and very prone to crying (those who make her cry will be attacked by her guardians, a group of tengu-karasu). She lives on a mountain with pure spiritual energy and, as a result, is vulnerable to evil energy. \
 \
 She is based on a spirit from Japanese folklore, the zashiki-warashi, accounting for her childlike naivety and innocence. \

Since Watanuki has seen spirits ever since he was born, Yuuko offers to take away his sight of the spirits in exchange for him working at the shop. He agrees and works at the shop until his debt is repaid. (Source: xxxHOLIC Wikia) ",
