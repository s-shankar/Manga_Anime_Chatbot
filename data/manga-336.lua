    I've hunted this manga for quite a while but there were always problems with the order. The translation was poorly done because it had a lot of spelling mistakes in it and failed to use proper use of the English language in some scenes.\
That aside, this is by far the best manga I have ever read. I am stunned, the concept is so simple but so well thought out.\
Well let's start with a quick introduction to the story. Eikichi Onizuka is a 22 year old virgin and ex-gang leader of the dreaded motorcycle gang 'Oni-Baku'. He's a street punk with piercings and bleached hair, a\
          \
        graduate from a fifth rate university and was captain of his karate team. Not exactly what you would call teacher material. Despite all this Onizuka manages to convince the principal and gets a job as a teacher, he's assigned to class 4 who are notorious for having driven every homeroom teacher to insanity. However Great Teacher Onizuka isn't such a pushover and he's determined to win them over one by one. Onizuka stumbles from one mishap to another, saving kids from jumping off rooftops, reuniting them with their parents, just making a difference. Though this all may seem very trivial, this is the most amusing story I have read.\
Moving on to the art, the art is very detailed and nice to look at. It's got that 90's drawing style that I appreciate very much. However if it weren't for the characters different personalities you'd have trouble telling them apart. Especially the girls all have somewhat the same face, and the only way you can tell them apart is by their hairstyle, which can be a bother sometimes. Overall there are quite some scenes were someone is standing on a rooftop looking over the city at dawn. It's these scenes that really get you into the art. Of course there are the infamous many faces from Onizuka that are just hilarious and make up for a lot.\
About the characters, I really like  the characters. I've fallen in love with a few of them. But one thing bothers me.. They're supposed to be 14 years old, yet they're so darn evil. I remember being 14, I wouldn't go as far to torture a teacher as they would, then again they have their reasons. Moving on to the character Eikichi Onizuka. Quite simply he's one of the best characters ever created. He's an inspiration, he's cool, funny, stays true, and above all he's human (though this can be debated). Onizuka is one of  the most instantly likeable characters you will ever read about. If I were ever to sit down and have dinner with any character real or fictional, it would without a doubt be Eikichi Onizuka. Though I wouldn't be willing to pick up the bill.\
I cannot remember the last manga I enjoyed this dearly, I hold this manga close to heart and it is definitely one that I won't be forgetting. Hell I'll just say it, I'm an Onizuka fan, and you could be too. Take it from me, reach deep in those pockets and get this manga, you won't regret it. And while reading you might even learn a thing or two from the greatest teacher in all of Japan, Great Teacher Onizuka.  \

    I can only use one word to describe this manga, OUTSTANDING! This is definitely must-read manga for all shounen manga lovers!\
The story is nevertheless to say, more than great. I didn't talk this blindly, though. This manga can describes what is going wrong with the education system in this era. The story can makes you more mature by understanding the society more deeply than ever. If you are thinking 'manga should not be too realistic' right now, then you are definitely wrong. While it describes how serious the problem is, it also slips many sense of humor (most of it is perverted one :P) and\
          \
        many reckless acts in it (The main character is ex-biker anyway, so nothing to be freaked out). Its not like what you will get sleepy while read this manga though. Takes some example, Onizuka saved his student from suicide attempt by jumping off the building. While it is seems awkward at start, but if it seen at another view, would it great if we got teacher like that? I'll describe the characters lately, so we jumped to artwork for now first.\
The most appealing art styles  in this manga is the unique face expression of the characters itself. I can say it is unique because no other  mangaka (as i know)  1used the style before. Their excessive expression will make some of readers laugh (myself too) even in some sort of serious situation. While it is unique, it is also, you know, realistic. (go and grab a copy of GTO and you will know what i mean)\
I can't deny that this manga  have  many well done character. The reason I can't give a high score to the characters design is THEY HAVE DIFFERENT HAIRSTYLE BUT SAME FACED CHARACTER IN IT especially male character. It bothers me when I see Murai and Kikuchi have same faces and the only things that differentiate them are glasses, skin colour and hairstyle!  The problem in characters is just appearance, though. But good things is all the characters has their very own personality.\
The enjoyment level is really high. You can read this manga all the day without getting bored even once. For my case, I've been read this manga in front of my monitor (I downloaded it) for nearly 6 hours non stop for 2 days. All the arc are not repetitive, and the most outstanding is you can't predict what will Onizuka do. You can predict the plot but not action by the Onizuka, so it may make you laugh until drops under the floor!\
My overall rating is 10 out of 10! You can download this manga at www.mangaspot.com. This is where i download the manga episodes. The server is a bit lag though but guess you have to be patient with it. If you know a better website, share it with me!\
This is my second reviews for manga, so it is not really good. But I will do better jobs next time! And thanks for reading my review!\

    Great Teacher Onizuka had some potential, but all of the humor is repetitive and juvenile, while unrealistic dramatic scenes dominate the plot more and more as the series drags on. Plot points and devices are reused to the point where they become dull, and they get so full-of-shit that there is actually a scene where a girl being told she’s a test-tube baby psychologically essentially scars her for life. Holy melodrama, batman! This manga is huge on bullshit backstories that are supposed to make us go \"awwwwww, not a bad guy/girl after all!\" by the way. Yeah, it’s definitely as irritating and ineffective as it\
          \
        sounds. \
\
Character development is unfortunately absent from our bland douche of a protagonist, and he is pretty much the same annoying dumbass for the duration of the plot. His way of solving issues with students is ridiculously unrealistic, and while this is sometimes acknowledged and played for laughs, it takes itself seriously far too often.  He’s mostly there for wish-fulfillment. As for his students, all developments in them come off as completely forced and contrived. Plus, almost all of them are blatant archetypes, who have some deep-seated reason to \"bawww nvr trust a teacher again!\" to boot. Another telling issue with the characterization is that just about all men above the age of twenty are, for whatever reason, portrayed as disgusting perverts. This may be a reflection on Fujisawa himself, given the large amount of poorly-placed fanservice. All antagonists in this series start off completely one-dimensional and unrealistic, but then they get some sob-story thrown in and their personality changes completely. No, that is not proper character development.\
\
The art is easily the weakest aspect. Almost everybody has the same exact face; you know, that one face that Fujisawa Tohru recycles endlessly in everything he does. The only face he knows how to draw, basically. Great Teacher Onizuka largely depends on visual humor for its value as a comedy, but all of the \"hilarious\" facial expressions were used over and over again, when they were never really funny in the first place. At the same time, they contribute heavily to my inability to take Great Teacher Onizuka seriously. The rest of the visual humor is just somewhat lame and, man, I hope you like seeing Onizuka’s ass, because you’re going to be getting a lot of that.\
\
All of the claims made by Great Teacher Onizuka’s rabid defenders about its \"societal commentary\" are completely untrue. Bullying is not dealt with much better, more interestingly, or realistically than in many other works I have seen. Furthermore, I failed to see what it actually criticized about the education system, other than the fact that not enough teachers are violent gangsters. This theme continues with just about everything else it supposedly comments on. It either just features these things in a cliché manner or does not really say much about them at all. There is no depth to Great Teacher Onizuka; it is just a simple drama and comedy. This would be fine did it do either of those things right, but, alas, it did not. \
\
I have no idea as to why this manga is so highly regarded. It is just not very good, plain and simple. I get second-hand embarrassment when reading all of those sentimental scenes about teaching, and then I have to wonder why Great Teacher Onizuka didn’t just stick to comedy. Then I remember that it wasn’t funny and I think to myself \"ah, that explains it.\" GTO started out as a decent parody of all of those stupid shows with a super-teacher who helps his students work out all of their problems and wins their hearts in the process, but it eventually fell victim to self-indulgence and became a stupid story in the same vein. It contributed nothing new nor anything of real value to the genres of school life, comedy, or drama. It never made me laugh out loud, and it never evoked any kind of physical or emotional response. Not in a good way, at least. At its best, it’s okay. At its worst, it’s goddamn painful. ",

    This manga, I can safely say, needs to be on everyone's \"must read\" list. I've been recommended this manga by a friend, and I tried it out. This was a refreshing change of pace from other popular manga out there. Maybe it was the more realistic setting, or it could have been the great arcs in each plot development. Whatever it was, I fell in love with this manga.\
To begin, let's start with the story. To be honest, I personally thought it was a bit slow in the beginning. The \"teacher\" portion of GTO doesn't actually happen until a bit later on. However, once Eikichi\
          \
        Onizuka, the star of the show, becomes a temporary teacher for the infamous Class 3-4 of Holy Forest Academy, things start picking up. Each situation in the beginning reveals more about Onizuka's way of dealing with things; no logic, just go with it. This philosophy keeps the plot going, and every situation is eventually resolved. Class 3-4 becomes nothing for the world's greatest teacher. The struggles and bonds portrayed in the story are downright inspiring and addictive to read about.\
The art was not to my liking in the beginning. I can forgive that, though, because in this modern age, we have tools that could make art more better looking than the 90s. Still, the art style was really good. I was laughing so much at the hilarious faces Onizuka can make when he's in a pickle. The art also got better in quality, which shows me that Tohru Fujisawa really knows how to improve his skills. By the end of the manga, I felt that the art was nothing short of amazing for the early 2000s. To put it simply, the beginning art was a bit disappointing, but it picks up and looks really good later.\
I love the characters portrayed in GTO. To be frank, I hate it when a manga uses a bunch of characters only once in the entire runthrough, because there could be more development with them. GTO does not disappoint, with nearly every character being important to the story. However, amidst the character roll call, only one stands above, and that is Eikichi Onizuka. He is the pinnacle of the \"likable protagonist.\" Even with a violent temper and strength befitting Hercules, his set of morals and life lessons help him become the greatest teacher ever. The greatest thing about him is his view on everything. Even as a 22-year old adult, he still acts like a kid. Normally this would be frowned upon, but it helps him connect with Class 3-4 and outsiders, forming deep bonds with them as he helps solve their past problems. Whether it be suicide or massive destruction, bloodlust or trauma, Eikichi Onizuka is the man for the job. This side of him, along with the simple brain of his, makes Mr. Onizuka one of my favorite manga characters of all time.\
Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed this manga. The beginning, to be honest, was a bit slow for me. I had to read through some number of pages before getting to the juicy tidbits of GTO. As I read, I got more and more sucked into the world of Class 3-4 and Onizuka. Even when I thought it couldn't get any better, it did. The second half of GTO was simply outstanding. The last two major story arcs were the highlights of the manga for me. This is just great to me, because the exciting stuff boils down in the end and not the beginning. If GTO had a graph describing its climactic moments from beginning to end, the line would rise and fall, each time getting higher and higher until the very end, settling down to a satisfying end. For the whole roller coaster rider known as Great Teacher Onizuka, I had a blast.\
To recap, GTO is an amazing manga series that can be picked up by anyone interested enough. You have got to read it; it's hilarious, dramatic, heartwarming fun contained in 25 volumes. It's inspiring in many ways; the series deals with so many life lessons that you yourself could potentially use practically. Who knows what could happen; honestly, this review is my first, and I wrote it because GTO is simply too awesome and outstanding to be ignored. Who knows; by reading this manga, maybe you could get a few pointers from Great Teacher Onizuka himself.\

    Great Teacher Onizuka (GTO): one of the most loved and inspirational manga in existence. Some even pursued a career in teaching after reading it! A story about a man with little in the way of education finding a place for himself in the world as a teacher; teaching kids with more education than himself lessons about life. A wonderful combination of hard-hitting drama, complete with characters with realistic, easy to relate to problems and plenty of over the top comedy. As well as being meaningful, it can inject warmth into even the coldest of hearts. Like mine.\
Story: 8/10 \
The story is centered around a man\
          \
        called Eikichi Onizuka. Like near enough every 22 year old male, he wants the easy life; a life involving lots of money, women and respect. And he is determined to get it, taking a resume with him and going to job interviews at big companies. However, there are a few minor problems: he looks like a street punk, he has bleached hair, he barely managed to graduate from a fifth rate college and he boasts about his martial arts skills on his resume, also mentioning the fact he is a virgin. Needless to say, he gets rejected every time he applies for a cushy office job. \
Close to giving up on the easy life, a chance encounter with an attractive high school girl, whom is having sex with a fat and bald teacher, changes his mind. After he comes to the shocking realization that teachers are surrounded by young and pure girls, he decides to become a teacher and fulfill his dream of marrying an attractive girl younger than himself. But his goal quickly changes once again after he helps a girl solve her family problems whilst on a teaching training course, and he decides to right the wrongs of the teachers who told him he was trash by becoming the greatest teacher in the world. \
While the premise is a simple one, the balance between drama and comedy and the wonderful execution makes the simplicity irrelevant. Living in the storage room at the top of Holy Forest (a co-ed private school), Onizuka helps the students in his class (3-4) in numerous ways, varying from using his street smarts to stop bullies by giving them a taste of their own medicine to simply being friends with his more lonely students. Unlike other teachers who, just like in real life, only care about their job and the money, he goes the extra mile, involving himself with his students in an attempt to make them enjoy their school years in a way he never was able to. Whether it involves saving his students from getting beaten and/or raped or helping them appreciate life by tying them to the front of his bike and driving them off an unfinished bridge (seriously), he is willing to do it. To begin with his class hate teachers in general because of a past experience, but by the end he manages to unite everyone in his class and earn the respect of all. \
However, I cannot claim the story is without its problems. Some of the arcs included repeat what has gone before and appear to have only been included just to pad out the series. And, by the end, there are many subplots left hanging, and in some cases it appears that the mangaka forgot to or lacked the motivation required to finish what he had started. Although these are in truth minor problems, largely ignorable because of how enjoyable GTO is to read, I can't objectively give the story top marks when it has so many minor but bothersome issues. \
Characterisation: 10/10 \
Nearly all of the important members of class four get fleshed out over the course of the story. Some more than others because a few get their very own lengthy arcs included, but even those who do not are usually heavily involved in the GTO proceedings. Rather than being driven by an over-arching plot, it is driven by numerous shorter stories that focus on a certain character or two, and Onizuka usually has to step in to help the character(s) involved. I think anyone who reads it would struggle not to find at least one character to add to their favourite character list: whether you are into a mommy's boy who protects his 27 year old (and often braless) mother from men at all costs (Kunio), a mentally slow but innocent and cute girl (Tomoko) or a girl with an IQ of 200 that masks her loneliness with her intellect (Urumi), there is a loveable character for everyone included. \
The best thing about the cast is that they all have relatable problems real people have. Some are dissatisfied with their lives, some have family issues, some have been abused - there is something everyone can relate to. If nothing else, pretty much everyone should be able to connect with the characters when it comes to their feelings about teachers and the barrier that exists between teacher and student. And, while it is true that the solutions to the casts various problems tend to be over the top for comedy purposes, none of the meaning is lost. In fact, the addition of often hilarious humour prevents the story as a whole from being a total downer. \
GTO is truly worthy of top marks when it comes to characterisation. The only possible reason I can think of to mark it lower is that not every subplot is seen through to conclusion, which is fairly bothersome for me since I became so invested in the lives of the characters. \
Art: 10/10 \
Are you tired of seeing the same background art repeated over and over, with new character poses drawn on top? If you are, then look no further than GTO, where even small objects in rooms are drawn with detail and the backgrounds rarely repeat...or at least not noticeably so. Because of the detailed drawings and the unusually large amount of text per page, the volumes take me far longer than a 180-200 page volume normally takes me to get though. \
I cannot stress enough how lovely the GTO art is. The character models are so well drawn and realistic that I actually found the female characters attractive (the mangaka deserves an award for 'Best Drawn School Girls Ever'). The expressions are spot on and everything looks as close to perfection as I can imagine a weekly manga ever getting. My only complaint is that, towards the end, some of the characters start to look like those introduced previously... But, to be fair, it is very harsh to criticize an artist for that when reviewing a 25 volume series - there are a huge amount of characters and keeping them all looking totally different is impossible. \
Overall: 9.5/10 \
In closing, GTO is a must read for everyone. It would be difficult for anyone not to be moved by the story and/or not get any laughs out of the comedy. Sure, it is perverted and a little silly at times, but that just adds to the flavour. It is safe to say the series has a little something for everyone, and that is why the series is a worldwide hit. If you do not own the series, go buy all 25 volumes, sit back and get ready for the sort of enjoyment very little in this world can provide you with.\

    I have never written a review for anything before, and I have a decent amount of anime/manga under my belt. But god damn, that is going to change right now. GTO is just calling for it.\
As someone who's watched the anime first then the manga, I'd say both are equally as good and are must watch/reads. The only way either can get any better is if they were longer, because this series just keeps you craving for more. The anime has great voice acting and its overall ambiance does the manga justice.\
Never have I laughed my ass off so hard before. Onizuka is outright hilarious,\
          \
        and ridiculously crude. However, the shits and giggles were only half of why this series is worth a perfect 10/10. Who knew that a perverted virgin former delinquent could possibly bring upon so many damn feels? Seriously, every saga of this series was incredibly touching and truly brought a new perspective in life to me. Onizuka's selflessness amazed me, as every time he would get himself stuck in a seemingly impossible situation, his trust and love for his students took priority. If teachers nowadays were not so bounded by the strict rules of compulsory education, maybe, just maybe an Onizuka would be brought to real life. Cause I'd die to attend his class.\
The story has no set plot, with everything you need to know introduced in the first few chapters. Onizuka wants to be a teacher, and takes on a rather unconventional method of teaching, breaking all rules when applicable. The rest of the series is simply several sagas showing the ways Onizuka touches the hearts of his rebellious class, and provides new life purposes to each of them. The art is great but not amazing, however the facial expressions were on point. The character development was great as each saga provided a slice of life, and effectively showed student maturation at an acceptable pace. Enjoyment is guaranteed, infinite/10. You don't need to be a male teen to appreciate the crude humor, there's something that'll make anyone piss his/her pants. Overall, this manga is simply inspirational. I recommend watching the 1999 live action as well, and of course the anime. Enjoy!\

Okay, I just wanted to throw in another character that really shined other than Onizuka. Urumi seriously is best girl. Her obsession with Onizuka is hilarious, from her plans to elope with him to flashing her private parts. Who would've expected feminine characteristics out of a mastermind genius who's hate for teachers was only paralleled by Aizawa. It really shows how much she loved him when she slit her wrists, and her saga was one of the most enjoyable ones along with Miyaki's. Go Kanzaki!!\

             Onizuka is a Ex biker gang member, a virgin and a 5th rate university drop out. His goal. To be the greatest teacher in all of japan. And that is precisely what he becomes in this 200 chapter masterpiece. Let me start by saying this is the greatest manga i have ever read. Do not watch it, read it and i promise you it will be one of the\
          \
        funniest things you have ever done. \
\
              The story mainly stretches on his part as a teacher at Holy Forest Academy. The only reason he could become a teacher is because of a chair lady, who believe he can pull miracles to change people. And thats what he does. He is assigned a class of Middle school kids, who is a group who have been through alot. Been betrayed by former teachers, they make it their crusade to torment all new teachers that are unlucky enough to be assigned to there class. But Onizuka aint no ordinary teacher.  Most of these arcs take place with him helping individual students or groups, from saving kids from jumping off the roof (sometimes he accidentally pushes them off) and landing on the Principals Cresla (a running gag, is that he always destroys the principals cars, and its super funny because of how the principal reacts) to jumping off unfinished roads on a motorcycle or saving them from Yakuza. Another reoccurring factor is people always try to get him fired. At one point they make him take a nation wide test that his students take. Keep in mind that Onizuka is dumb as hell and another running gag is to always misuse Kanji letters on the board to spell crude words. Because he's dumb like that. And before he takes the test, he fights about 30 Yakuza, has 4 bullet wounds in him, And ACES the 5 hour test in 1 hour. Fuck you Teshigawa.\
\
           Anyway, the story is always funny and can make me cry like a baby. Sometimes i'm Babbling, and sometimes i'm literally laughing my ass off. Even though devices are used multiple times, the series is never boring or full of redundant panels. The way Onizuka gets everyone on his side, is just, so freaking mind blowing. This series made me think over on my whole opinion of educators and the education system. I am an Onizuka enthusiast to the core. His ideals and words are truly some of the most manly things ever. And he cares about his students! Even when he was framed for Embezzling money for the school field trip to some nature shithole and he had EVIDENCE that he didn't to it, he got up and told the whole school to make up for it, he'd pay for a trip to Okinawa instead. Like WTF! All because he didn't want to ruin the reputation of the student who framed him. INSPIRING!\
           The art is Tokyo Pop, so its bound to be solid. And it is, but the one of the best things about it is, the smallest side panels with absolutely the funniest responses and conversations ever. You will miss some if your not careful though, so keep your eyes peeled. Also, we have these 3 bonus chapters about his friend Saijami the dirty cop. In these chapters, your in first person perspective of Onizuka and you don't know what your saying, but you can guess from your friends responses. These are super funny, i can't explain, but just look out for those 3 special chapters, they are the core of GTO's comedy.\
            The characters to me, all feel like REAL Japanese school kids. This Ain't your fake moe shit, these all feel like real people, with real problems. Each character gets development, some more than others, but the main bunch of his kids get their own arcs or problems. Everyone is basically solid, not ground breaking, but enough to hit my heart. At least with some. Everyone's hurtin, so open up your tight asshole. But my favorite character is Onizuka. Now let me tell you a bit about my buddy here. He is fucking TOUGH. Fuck Chuck Norris, he's for tools. Onizuka can beat the shit out of anyone, no matter how many or tough. One time, he arm wrestled 100 tough shit ass men in a row. And he won. One guy was like 3 times his size too. Also, he survives falling from roofs unto cars without a scratch. Him and Goku are broski's.\
\
           I ENJOYED GTO!! Yeah hell right i did. I have gone through it about, 4 times. It doesn't bore me and i'm still chuckling. Just the craziest thing to read ever, i love it. I hope you do too.\
So get ready for language you would be slapped for using, biology that would make a grown man bluss and math that doesn't add up, unless of course, your the Great Teacher Onizuka.\

    When I started reading this manga, it was mainly for the comedy. I did not expect to be so \"touched\" by the story and yet Eikichi Onizuka pulls of another feat!\
Story (8)\
Great Teacher Onizuka (GTO) is a single story broken down into several arcs. Most arcs fit together neatly to form a neat and coherent story line. This seems to me to be the most effective method of narrating the story as if it was episodic the whole manga would have seemed messy.  \
Overall, the story is simple, but there is a constant undercurrent of mystery and drama running through the background. By setting\
          \
        out the story in this manner Fujisawa effectively regulates \"the flow of suspense\" allowing it to grow just enough to keep the reader going and not make the story boring.\
The whole plot consists of unexpected turns and twists for a comedic effect. The main drama story line was easily predictable though but then, it’s a comedy so that doesn't matter too much (to me at least).\
The manga fulfils its role as a comedy perfectly. Hilariously awkward scenes, a touch of crude humour and lots of fan service contribute to making a fantastic cocktail of entertaining comedy.\
Art (9)\
When I first started reading the art was what I found least attractive in the story. This was mainly because Onizuka doesn't really look like a shounen hero. Now having finished the manga, I appreciate this difference. Onizuka is not your ordinary hero and his artwork is what illustrates this difference very clearly.\
Realistic artwork overall therefore: Fujisawa did not portray an ideal world; he drew ours, flaws and ugliness included. This artwork is perhaps what made the story most lifelike. Throughout the read, the characters look real enough to be people you might cross on the streets and this is something I appreciated a lot. \
Character designs were perfect. Nothing to criticize there: all character designs fit their personalities (no exaggerations) very well enabling a nice and understandable story flow.\
Character (8)\
The heart of the story. All major characters were very well developed through their own arcs or several flashbacks showing how they ended up the way they are now. The characters were well rounded, having their own strengths and weaknesses which again contributed to the story's realistic setting.\
As the story progresses the characters become more developed and improve a lot. Few characters are left without a back story.\
Antagonists had proper motives for their acts (as well as a shounen manga bothers about that anyway) and did not simply appear out of the blue. All were properly connected to the story.\
Enjoyment (9)\
Setting aside the comedy, what I loved most in GTO was Onizuka's vision of a school. It is an idea which has deeply touched me for it is sweet, simple yet amazingly accurate. Not going to give any spoilers here so I'll avoid going on about this.\
I am sure that this manga will be enjoyed by all thanks to its impressively well-balanced mixture of comedy, ecchi, drama and explosive action.\

    \"Fuyutsuki, sometimes violence is the only way to get the message across.\" seems not like a line any teaches should say ... But not for our protagonist hes little different if i might say...\
So Another manga is in my hands i have read it quite a few times its about School life which is seen trough this one Teacher who is kind of different from what we call a teacher Bad manners , rude and violent is what i would call him but hey he has quite a few sides to him and dealing with all kinds of students calls for having all kinds of\
          \
        sides to you.\
Great Teacher Onizuka or other name GTO tells a story about an Teacher Onizuka who is something like a kid himself thrown himself into a world he knows nothing much and trying to change everything how it seems fit for him like trouble students or lonesome students ... preventing suicides or persuading is everyday life for our Teacher which makes us want to read further on... and this comes from a person who hated school so much hah one of a kind Teahcer indeed.\
While going on with the story we see how much Onizuka himself develops in being an teacher or being an friend his dumbness remain but i would call it the charm point here and with him every single student changes from being Closed up in their worlds they start to open up to him to the point where it becomes hard to live for them when hes not around or even the events that occur during the story makes you shiver but Most of the things in this Manga is indeed from real World ... Because such students exists all around the world Cruel , rude , violent and so much more to it than anyone can see.\
Helping us to understand what kind of hard Work is teachers doing in order to teach us new things this manga brings in a lot of comedy here and there even at the most tense moments writer drops a Bomb that makes you crack and laugh...\
Great Teacher Onizuka is an one of those mangas that aren't found anywhere around even if we have quite a lot of other teacher mangas its still unique and worth reading alone to see this Man in action.\
I want to be a teacher\
Yes i wanted myself to be one before but this guy who would think he could be an Teacher ... when you look at his back ground you will think the same and ask Why? it just seems funny and well his methods ar just mind blowing ... Sorry i laughed here.\
Students\
Students that are shown here are all trouble makers or lonesome or misguided which has something to do with school problems or having problems at home still is no problem for our Onizuka he will break the walls to change their life's he will help everyone of them even if it costs his life developing in every step of the manga changing feelings and changing hatred to admiration is an nice view.\
Overall\
Manga is overflowing with all kinds of strange feelings its like a escalator seems everything is going the way it should but they drop you down and then throw you up again and down and up and so goes until the point when its time to do critical decisions still the manga is great and is nice to read i would to call it Brilliant. \
Art\
Oh this is an aspect that i wasn't to fond of but well it was great indeed so serious at times so dumb at times and SO UGLY at times but i laughed and well can't say much anymore ^^\

    Did you hate school growing up? Of course you did, doesn't everyone for different reasons? Great Teacher Onizuka (GTO) is one of the great manga classics. It follows Onizuka Eikichi who is a ex-motorcycle gangster turned homeroom teacher, which basically means he is the most awesome teacher of all time! Sure you won't do well on the SATs with him as a teacher, but as you may find out from this manga, there is more to school than just studying.\
Great Teacher Onizuka is a hilarious comedy that you won't be able to resist. But what will really hook you are the moving stories of each\
          \
        student that explore the social problems facing youth in schools.\

    Great Teacher Onizuka is one of the best Mangas there is. Why? Because it's very simple and it relates to other peoples lives. (Spoilers maybe included)\
GTO's doesn't really have a straight story on it apart from stories of other peoples lives divided into each part in the Manga itself. There are stories of Betrayal, hurt, distrust, and many more things that have happened to peoples lives but what's so brilliant about this is how GTO changed people's views on how to live. For example: Urumi, she distrust teachers because she has been betrayed before. But then after knowing Onizuka and Onizuka teaching her one of\
          \
        his \"lessons\" he started to trust teachers again, he started going to school again. or Fuyutsuki, Fuyutsuki you could call her a teacher that \"reads out of a text book\" kind of teacher but is prooved not effective in controlling the Class, Onizuka just had to say about 2 sentences and she made use of that and apply it to her students. The Manga itself is fictional but you know what? The situations are real, Rape/Betrayal/Bullying all those things are true and there are people who suicide/despise things over those. That's what's so brilliant about it, you can relate to it, because you USE/ARE a student you know how it feels like, you know how it feels like to be betrayed maybe not rape but something similar.\
The Art of GTO is, I must say, pretty decent, with some bits being scattered or blurry. But Overall it's decent. The characters faces are somewhat unique to the typical \"manga eyes\" or \"manga hair\" But they are mostly the same. I like their facial expressions though :D\
The characters of GTO are what makes it such an epic Manga. different emotions different stories different personalities. Those are what makes GTO, but just that isn't a masterpiece, the way they go from a person who wants to die to a person who wants to live the rest of his life are what makes this a masterpiece. GTO teaches us something, how to live your life, how to face pain, how to almost do anything.. really. For example: Betrayal: Ai Tokiwa has been invited to his Boyfriends House just casually, but then was rape by 5 guys. Anyone would think that that was a sick thing to do, now she goes and beats up everyguy because she THINKS every guy is like that. But then Onizuka change her mind about guys. I'm sure those kind of things happens, GTO teaches you how to get over it, how to leave those things behind, how it's bad to judge people. GTO is about Morals and how it was portrayed in the story is the best thing about it.\
I enjoy reading GTO at first I read it casually but then I started reading it more often as the story was getting interesting. GTO is not at all a serious Manga or rather it IS a serious Manga with Comedy bits on it. I won't say that GTO is just comedy with serious scenes on it because it's just not that. I mean most of the time GTO is seen goofing around the school, peeping at girls panties, all those are also, you may say, a way to make a point, live your life to the fullest! \"If you always worry about the past it's your loss because you won't be able to enjoy the present.\" - Eikichi Onizuka. Yes! those quotes as well. I remember hearing one: Give a kid a smoke, he'll be happy for a day. TEACH a kid to smoke, he'll be happy for the rest of his shortened lifetime. - GTO. Really GTO is reality with Fiction on it.\
Overall One of the,if not THE, best manga's I've ever seen \

    At first i thought that this is another try-to-be-fun manga , with panty-shots and stuff , but as the story develops it tends to get more \"serious\" .\
The story is concentrated around Onizuka but , other people get center stage sometimes.\
I liked the level of realism of the problems the people are faced in the series , and though Onizuka`s problem-solving is somewhat exaggarated , it`s only to ilustrate a point , and this manga does that in great fashion.\
Story is fun stuff (maybe since i encounter this kinda story for the first time)\
Art  .. i`m no critist to judge art, but it was\
          \
        kewl for my taste\
Characters are a bit stereotypical, but they interact well.\

    Where should i even start\
The story is good, it had a slow start, if you compare it with the action that comes packed in the later chapters of the manga.Then it picked up the pace when the students and other teachers started plotting against onizuka then it ends with a happy ending for everyone.\
The art is good. the backgrounds had a lot of detail into it, although the one major down point is the character's faces overall it's fine.\
Character, whew don't get me started on this one. The characters are perfect. Most, if not all had very intense characteristics. Now i don't wanna give off\
          \
        a spoiler but if you ask me my favorite character is Urumi. She's a genius but she's also a bitch to her enemies, but she's also really really sweet to Onizuka to the point of actually trying to elope once.\
I really enjoyed this manga and by enjoyed i don't mean that it's all \"AHAHAHA LOL FUNNY\", it's mostly funny but i have cried 32 times because of this manga in all my 5 re-reads of this manga. Hell, i even cried in my cousin's birthday party because of this\
Overall this manga deserves a 10/10 and it also receives my XLRBP stamp\

    Great teacher onizuka is a ambiguous manga. It's comical, but also give the importants values of life.\
The story is overstated, but anyway explain really good the Japanese society and their problematics.\
At the start much characters are Onizuka's enemies(the skirmishs among Onizuka and Hiroshi Uchiyamada are very fabulous). The Onizuka's enemies are repressed and hate the attitudes of Onizuka, but him aniway always continue for the own path.\
Onizuka is the one best manga characters. It's the  teacher that all would have. The stupid expressions of Onizuka are great, and the personality is comic and matured at the same time.\
The design is good, expect for the\
          \
        face that are all similar.\
It's a absorbing manga, reccomended for all.\

    This is one of those mangas that you will hear everyone praise as one of the greats, but do not be fooled by the masses. Its a stereotypical teacher drama with crude humor and a plot that repeats itself over and over. For example, student has a problem and dislikes the main character or one of the main characters friend. Student than is taught a lesson by main character through tough love, rinse and repeat. The art in many cases isn't as bad as people think, its just different and we all know people hate change. The boys don't look like girls instead they look\
          \
        like boys and all the girls practically look the same, so in essence it has a little realism instead of exaggerated facial features and body parts. But all these negatives aside its a good read just not great. The main character grows on you and you accept his actions as thoughtful and hilarious. You cheer him on till the very end and Onizuka may very well be one of the greatest charatcers in manga and anime history. That alone makes this a decent read. If you haven't read it, i suggest you do, just don't buy into the hype. Its good but not great, but by all means its better than most of the crap out there.\

    Ah, Great Teacher Onizuka. The manga that changed my life. I remember being 17 years old with the latest volume of the manga, walking home as I'm reading it and laughing like a maniac while doing so. Since I left for the military and returned 4 years later, my 25 volume collection has pretty much disappeared. Now my only chance of reminiscing Onizuka's adventures involves me picking up a volume at the nearest Barnes and Noble, while trying not to distract other readers and shoppers with my guffaws. \
Story: 8\
The plot in Onizuka starts off very strong and continues throughout. It shows no signs of\
          \
        slowing down until the final arc of the manga where the crazy stories are now more like WTF with a few unresolved plot lines. But even Onizuka at its worst is several times more entertaining than most shonen manga. \
Art: 9 \
From beautiful to crude to downright ugly, Onizuka's illustrators definitely give each character (and reaction) a distinguished look. The overall art style is definitely a step above the manga/anime archetypical look and fits the tone of the series. \
Character: 10\
GTO has a huge cast of characters, owing in part to the large classroom, school staff, and even returning characters from Shonan Junai Gumi. Many of them have screen time, and seeing them develop as the series goes is one of the most fulfilling moments of the series.\
Enjoyment: 15 \
If only I can rate it higher than a 10. GTO's raunchiness and over-the-top humor will entertain you to no end. I cannot count the number of times I had to catch my breath from laughing so hard. And yet among the hilarious scenes, there are some heartfelt moments to be treasured as well as real life lessons to be learned. \
Overall: 10\
GTO is a manga unlike any other. Despite its few flaws, it has since become a classic and one of the most revered series from Japan. There's been an anime and live adaptations, but believe me when I say they are tame, Disney G-rated versions when compared to the manga. If you want to get the most out of this series, do yourself a big favor and read the manga. You won't regret it!\

    All in all, i give this manga a 10 for \"overall\". I do give a few 9's and it doesn't seem to make any sense. But i give 10 for \"overall\" because i haven't found any manga that surpasses this, that however is my opinion.\
If i were you, then i would just give this manga a try because this manga has a very high score on average. Don't even bother reading negative reviews. I can't understand why some people rate this manga very low. I do understand however that when people hate something, then they're just going to find another reason to hate it, then\
          \
        find more reasons to hate it, and so on.\
Really.. You can ask people for enjoyable manga titles similar to GTO or even surpasses GTO. I believe that most people would just find it hard to answer that question.\
For those who rated this manga really low, please answer this question. If you were the author of this manga and you hated this manga, then would you let your hatred stop you from publishing this manga? Btw, this manga sold more than 45 million copies which means the 10% royalty is something like millions of $$$. Logically, you wouldn't do that.. unless... you're ?????? (use your imagination and replace that ?????)\

From this, she and her cohorts began their quest of kicking out any teacher who will be assigned to their class. They were successful in making these teachers resign, but Onizuka... \
 \
 In the manga, what drives Miyabi to go bad and lead a rebellion against teachers is an incident which occurred when she was in the 7th grade. She had been the favorite student of Mr. Ogi, teacher of Class 2-4 (the name of her class back in junior high). Ogi would praise her for her beauty and intelligence often. Miyabi misinterpreted this as Mr. Ogi having a crush on her. As a result, Miyabi began behaving and dressing in a more mature manner. She started cooking him lunch every day. She also started wearing revealing clothes ( such as miniskirts and tanktops). Instead of setting Miyabi straight, Mr. Ogi went along with it. To some degree, he did like Miyabi. He continued to praise her and accept her subtle advances. One day, Miyabi is invited to Mr. Ogi's house. She goes, thinking he is going to confess his love for her. As soon as she gets there, Mr. Ogi introduces her to his fiance. Miyabi storms off in tears, feeling hurt and used. As revenge, Miyabi takes illicit photos of herself and goes into class the next morning telling her classmates that Mr. Ogi raped her and then took pictures (knowing that Mr. Ogi's hobby is photography). Since that day, Miyabi has hated teachers.\

Her quiet manner and moderate ideas are misleading as she proves to be very tough on her own sometimes scaring even tough Onizuka. To prepare him for the test which would determine his teaching career, she prepares a mountain of jelly with eyes of Maguro tuna fish as fruits and imposes impossibly tough schedule that would have killed anyone or drove them mad. Her field of teaching is Kokugo or Japanese language (English in the Live Action). She, not that surprisingly, falls in love with Onizuka, but as both are quite reluctant to admit their feelings and show them in the open they claim that they are just \"friends\". It's not really a major matter to anyone else except Suguru Teshigawara, who finds it most aggravating that a woman with her qualifications would fall in love with one with such a crude background as Onizuka. She has difficulty with the female students in her class due to all the boys in her class having crushes on her but brings them around fairly quickly after Onizuka's advice. She has a younger sister named Makoto.  \
 The Azusa Fuyutsuki portrayed in the live action drama differs greatly from the anime and manga versions. In that version, Fuyutsuki became a teacher because she felt she was forced to, and envies the life of her sister, who became a stewardess who frequently dates male celebrities (and receive some fancy gifts as well.) She eventually decides to remain a teacher thanks to some convincing from Onizuka, though the two are continuously depicted as at odds with each other with love strongly implied. The live-action version of Fuyutsuki also has a dislike for men in general, finding them too possessive over women, though Onizuka also convinces her that she too is guilty of that same sin. Interestingly, she is also present to many of the \"lessons\" that Onizuka personally teaches his students. \

      description = "The antithesis to the \"dumb blonde\" stereotype, Urumi Kanzaki is a prodigy with an IQ over 200. She is also a heterochromatic, possessing different colored eyes: one brown and one blue. However, she is psychologically disturbed, having her fair share of hate toward teachers. Her genius is displayed repeatedly by such abstract actions as the detonation of time bombs (i.e. firecrackers in disposable boxes) and making a harmless snake look like a cobra using paper cutouts. Her intellect is also shown through actions, such as shouting curse words in French and being able to speak fluent Mandarin. On the trip in Okinawa, Toshito Kikuchi noted that she can speak 5 languages, but ironically, she doesn't understand what her Gundam otaku roommates say. \
 Her hatred for teachers stems from her time in elementary school. Urumi's teacher, Ms. Fujimori, while initially welcoming and receptive, wasn't able to handle her intellect properly, since she went to a second-rate college, and it was her first year teaching. Urumi's constant requests for the teacher's time, both inside and outside of school, as well as the fact that the lessons she wanted to learn from the teacher included extremely advanced, college-level subjects (such as differential calculus) eventually made the teacher snap. When Urumi interrupted Ms. Fujimori's lecture to correct her in front of the whole class, the teacher then told Urumi's secret to her class. While it isn't stated explicitly, it can be deduced that her intelligence is derived from her biological father, when Urumi tells Eikichi Onizuka that her mother had selected a sperm-donor, based on his intellect and nothing more. It is even suggested that her mother took the sperm from an American scientific genius (this information can be gleaned from a scene where Urumi and her mother visited some friends in the United States, and Urumi was led into a dark storage room by a doctor, who explains to her that her father is actually just a bottle of donated sperm); this also explains Urumi's natural, blond hair. Naturally, this caused a great deal of psychological trauma to Urumi, and quite an understandable hatred of teachers. It is still unclear what happened to Ms. Fujimori, as her last appearance in the storyline was begging Onizuka to help Urumi before something terrible happens to her.\
 \
 She is later found by Miyabi in a small apartment, and hired to torture Onizuka. Formerly a student at Holy Forest for a while, but stopped attending regularly after some time, she begins almost immediately, as she frames him for lechery and sends him to jail overnight, only to appear in class and on his homeroom roster the morning after. Onizuka's frustration with her vastly increases, when Vice-Principal Uchiyamada strictly advises him that he cannot inflict physical harm on her due, to her educational potential. Urumi is eventually able to turn Onizuka into her slave (more-or-less, her \"genie\") by threatening to have him arrested, after she fakes her death when he accidentally pushes her off a building.\
 \
 However, all this changes when she encounters her Ms. Fujimori again, awakening her deepest hatred and causing her to direct her wrath at the student body. Onizuka responds by bringing his biker gang to school and \"kidnaps\" her from class. He is finally able to get through to her by almost killing the two of them by jumping over - and nearly falling into - a gap at a suspension bridge, despite her attempts to convince him that she is not afraid of anything, including death. Onizuka makes her see past her trauma, however bad, just isn't worth messing up the present with (in the manga, he does this by having his biker friends share their life experiences with her). Inspired, she allies with Onizuka, and helps with his troubles.\
 \
 Despite her switch in allegiance, Urumi continues her feud with Miyabi, until Miyabi reveals her origins to the student body. Urumi retaliates by setting up a web page, where she promises to post pictures of Miyabi in her bathroom (Urumi had earlier placed a hidden camera), after a countdown timer reaches zero. However, the site reveals only a single photograph of Urumi, Miyabi, and Tomoko Nomura during their younger years. Urumi never had any intention of ruining Miyabi; she just wanted to scare her. Urumi attempts suicide at an indoor skiing arena by freezing to death, but Onizuka rescues her. It is after this incident that Urumi considers Onizuka to be her \"favorite.\"\
 \
 She grows extremely infatuated with Onizuka, to the point of wanting to elope with Onizuka. Urumi takes a more stereotypical role of a character that prefers the use of violence, in response to jealousy - she is often seen beating Onizuka mercilessly every time he tries to fulfill his pervertednes. Urumi states Onizuka should wait for her hormones to start kicking in, because she's sure that she would have a bouncing body by then. Like Noboru Yoshikawa, her loyalty to Onizuka is extremely strong, to the point that she would consider suicide, if he were to leave, believing that her own life is worthless without him around.\

He tries to blackmail him into resignation with several pictures posted all across the school for everyone to see. Onizuka catches Kikuchi and instead of punishing him, hires him to make composite pictures of Azusa Fuyutsuki and other female teachers, much to his surprise. \
 Kikuchi eventually befriends Onizuka, and later helps Noboru Yoshikawa prevent Anko Uehara's mother, the president of the local Parent-Teacher Association, from getting Onizuka fired. Kikuchi is an amateur martial artist, having prior experience in judo and other techniques learned from Mayu Wakui (in the live-action, he claims he only knows it, and does not demonstrate this claim). It is revealed after the examinations that he was the one who switched Onizuka's test papers for a perfect score. When questioned about the actual results that Onizuka has, Kikuchi calculates it himself, and is thoroughly surprised at the score (it is unknown whether Onizuka actually did score perfect, or a score befitting his intelligence), and asks him directly, to which his teacher replies that he definitely received a perfect score.\

After initially messing up her role in one of Miyabi Aizawa's plans to get Onizuka fired, she is cut off from Miyabi's group. Seeing her rather slow, clumsy nature, Onizuka enters her into a local beauty contest. He even arranges two porn producer friends to dress her up for the competition. Rather than read the given script for the acting category, Onizuka gives her a couple of action figures and she ends up doing an excellent improvised piece (with Vice-Principal Uchiyamada getting an accidental role). In the anime, Onizuka throws a cellphone on stage and she leaves a sentimental message on Miyabi's answering machine instead. She doesn't win, but she gets noticed by several television producers and begins starring in various commercials. Her young male manager, impressed with her natural beauty, and after falling in love at first sight, makes it his lifetime goal to help her succeed.\

 She was friends with Urumi Kanzaki since childhood, and their close bond likely arose out of their opposite personalities (Tomoko is clumsy and rather docile with a heart of gold, compared to Urumi's intellect and potential to be savagely cruel).\
 \
 A side-story in the manga features Tomoko and her manager, also called GTO, only it stands for Great Tomoko Oppai (Oppai meaning breasts). In it, Tomoko's manager embarks on one very madcap adventure to save her from her dubious producers. In the live-action, instead of her succeeding dramatically in subsequent episodes, she would part for an Okinawa acting school.\

      description = "Birthday: August 3, 1975 \
 A 22-year-old, hormonal, blonde-haired biker and virgin, Onizuka Eikichi graduated from a bottom-rung university by cheating and, as such, cannot get a decent job. His main way of spending time is peering up girls' skirts in a local mall. He is very athletic, as he can bench press 150 kg (331 lbs), has a second dan black belt in karate, and even claims to perform 500 push-ups, 1000 pull ups and 2000 squats daily.\
 \
 Through the events explained in the Great Teacher Onizuka manga, Onizuka decides to become a teacher, even though it is later implied that he has an IQ of about 50 (Though not necessarily true). His initial teacher training is in the Musashino Public High School, where he meets Nanako Mizuki. His experience taming the rowdy gangs in his assigned class hardens his convictions that teaching is the way to go, and when he learns of Mizuki's problems, he also decides to abstain from sexual experience with his students, opting to solve their personal issues for them, instead.\
 \
 Unfortunately, he nearly messes up by forgetting to take the public teachers' civil service exam. As a result, no public high school will take him, but he is still eligible for a number of private schools. He manages to get a job at the upper-crust Holy Forest Academy, despite the objections of vice-principal Uchiyamada Hiroshi, whom he continues to aggravate well into his tenure. Of course, one of the conditions of having the job at Holy Forest is that he must sleep at the school&mdash;in the storage room at the top floor, with roof access&mdash;and it is here that Onizuka officially starts his career in teaching, when he stops Yoshikawa Noboru from committing suicide.\
 \
 Onizuka is put in charge of class 3-4, a class so bad it has already driven several teachers insane. Not only does he survive the class's brutal bullying tactics, but he also befriends his students, and the backbone to the story of Great Teacher Onizuka consists of his unique experiences in turning his students around and learning lessons of his own.\
 \
 It is later implied again, during the National Exams, that Onizuka might actually be some sort of genius. His exam results were swapped: once for full marks, and once for just short of full marks. However, when Yoshito Kikuchi is asked whether he is curious about Onizuka's true results, he checks the answers himself and the result amazes him. He checks with Onizuka, who states that he definitely got perfect results from his own effort (which would be incredible, since he did a 5 hour exam in 1 hour, bleeding, and having 4 bullets in his stomach).\
 \
 Onizuka has incredible physical resilience. On more than one occasion, he has fallen from heights that would instantly kill most people and claims to have a sort of healing factor, as he healed from a broken arm in less than a day, and even endure multiple gunshot wounds, in a short period of time. Onizuka often presents his strength in unintentionally flamboyant ways, such as arm wrestling over 100 men of exponential strength in a row and winning (including the character Heihachi from the Tekken series of fighting games, and Jason Voorhees from the films called Friday the 13th (series)). His fighting abilities are not to be taken lightly either, as Onizuka is capable of fending off multiple opponents, even if they are well-armed, and almost never receives any physical damage.\
 \
 In spite of his impressive fighting skills, Onizuka is often roughed up by his students, and others, whenever he behaves badly. It could be speculated that deep down, Onizuka knows when he's acting immature, and allows others to keep him in line. An example of this is when he forces his students to dig the earth for buried treasure during the Okinawa trip. Kanzaki Urumi kicks Onizuka into a hole, and later forces him to wear S&M garb and has him crawl around on all fours, with Urumi riding on his back. Yet another example is when Principal Uchiyamada has Onizuka over for dinner and hits him upside the head with a wooden bench after finding out that Onizuka was acting a bit of a letch with his daughter one day (Onizuka was playing \"where's the nipple\" with his daughter, at a karaoke bar in town).\
 \
 His personal mode of transportation is a Kawasaki Z2 motorcycle 750cc type S. The bike itself is also featured heavily in the prequel series to GTO.\

Although Eikichi Onizuka swore off relations with female students, their mothers are still available, thus, he attempts to woo her on multiple occasions, even asking her out once. \

However, although she seems sweet and innocent, she actually suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder, and has an evil side who calls herself Yasha. \
 She is a member of the Midnight Angels gang under Junya Akutsu, and is his girlfriend. Her mental disorder arose after he raped her in the past. Ryuji saves her life, and she eventually overcomes her problems and becomes his girlfriend. They are still together in GTO.\
 \
 \
 Briefly seen in the manga, Nagisa Nagase is Ryuji Danma's attractive, grad-school girlfriend, where they first met in the GTO prequel, Shonan Junai Gumi. In the manga, when Eikichi Onizuka is exceptionally angry, and does not wish to teach the class, he is shown sitting behind his desk contemplating, while the students watch a lesson given by Nagisa through a videotape, albeit reluctantly, through its footage.\
 \
 In the anime she first appears when Onizuka and Danma are having a conversation in a bar after Onizuka's interview. Onizuka tries to dive right into her bosom when Danma grabs him right by the collar and shortly starts throwing punches at Onizuka for being a bit of a lech towards Nagisa. She does not appear in the live-action. \

 In the Shonan Junai Gumi OVA (episode 4), Nagisa is seen with long, straight dark hair and goes to the prestigious Fujisawa Girls School. A hanya tattoo appears on Nagisa's back, near her left shoulder, whenever her alternate personality Yasha surfaces and she rides a black Kawazaki Eliminator motorcycle.\

He states the prospect of having a beautiful, 16 year-old wife, even at the age of 40, is irresistible to the ears of the 22 year-old Onizuka. Upon learning that Nanako Mizuki has been staying over at Onizuka's apartment, with no action going on, Ohsawa insists that he forces himself on her, and videotape it to keep her quiet about it (ensuring that Onizuka's \"merchandise\" won't go to waste). However, Onizuka does not follow-up with Ohsawa's advice. \
 Ohsawa is not seen, after Onizuka finishes his training, but it is revealed that he was caught having an affair with a student, and left for another training session, away from Musashino High. \

However, other obstacles present themselves throughout—including the frustrated, balding vice principal, Hiroshi Uchiyamada; old enemies from his biker days; and his own idiotic teaching methods. But Eikichi fights it all whilst trying to help his students, romance fellow teacher Azusa Fuyutsuki, and earn his self-proclaimed title.
