Kamina is a free-spirited loose cannon bent on making a name for himself, while Simon is a timid young boy with no real aspirations. One day while excavating the earth, Simon stumbles upon a mysterious object that turns out to be the ignition key to an ancient artifact of war, which the duo dubs Lagann. Using their new weapon, Simon and Kamina fend off a surprise attack from the surface with the help of Yoko Littner, a hot-blooded redhead wielding a massive gun who wanders the world above. In the aftermath of the battle, the sky is now in plain view, prompting Simon and Kamina to set off on a journey alongside Yoko to explore the wastelands of the surface. Soon, they join the fight against the \"Beastmen,\" humanoid creatures that terrorize the remnants of humanity in powerful robots called \"Gunmen.\" Although they face some challenges and setbacks, the trio bravely fights these new enemies alongside other survivors to reclaim the surface, while slowly unraveling a galaxy-sized mystery.

They were screaming like crazy speeches, faced the impossible, and said things that made no sense, but that even so we did say \"EPIC\".\nThere was a time.\nA time of captains Harlock, a master time Asia, a time of Domons.\nLogic was not important. The strategy was not important. If you believe in the impossible, impossible would be nothing in front of you.\nThe time is gone\nA wave of animes that have to be \"realistic\", \"philosophical\", \"adults\" around us. Are good? Are. Meet your purpose? Meet.\nHowever, however ... I miss something.\nCharacters idiots who laugh in the face of death, and not\n          \n        to be shaken by anything. Characters that I remember that, in essence, in the beginning, were not meant to be realistic.\nNo wonder that I am addicted to shonens: manga as One Piece, Fairy Tail remind me that there are heroes who still believe that boundaries are bullshit, and that men should talk about crazy dreams with a smile on his face.\nFew original anime (non-manga based) can pass this spirit, and if I had to indicate a Studio to produce an epic-without-notion, \"Gainax\" probably would not be the first on my list.\nBut they did so. Oh, how did.\nLadies and gentlemen, forgiveness for the lengthy introduction: Let's talk of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.\nMany have already heard things about this series of 27 episodes. Effusive praise. Discouraging reviews. And you may already have heard the following phrase: \"compliments to the Gurren Lagann are exaggerated\"\nAnd let us be clear: Yes. ARE.\nBut it could not be otherwise.\nGurren Lagann anime is not the type that parses. Is the type of anime to which you manifested with exaggeration and passion. \"Overkill\" is the key word of the anime: everything is extremely Titanic, extreme, \"over-the-top\", \"larger than life\", etc.\nWith certain exceptions (some Gundam, some Macross, tss), never been a fan of mecha anime. Would be far from the top of my list and, being this a recurrent genre in every new season animes, I believe my dismay is understandable: it is both anime mecha clamoring arrogantly that will \"revolutionize the genre\", \"overcome Evangelion\", \"be the new Gundam\" and other things that many simply die on the beach, lost in own mediocrity.\nGurren Lagann will by reverse path: doesn't take itself seriously. Does not involve complex plots policies or attempts to \"explore the essence of the human being\". It's about guys inconsequential facing death in colorful fuses (and often ungainly) and BLOWING THINGS UP. Many things.\nThe series is a species of \"giant parody mecha\", a spoof so well done that took an undeniable brilliance. As the series develops, over the hump \"70 years\" (frantic action and episodic with colored robots), \"80 years\" (frantic action and sequential with specific enemies ... and colored robots!), \"90 years\" (frantic action with colorful robots ... in space!) and Century 21 (IE ... a tribute to the series, where the hype coming into the extreme).\nThe series features a climate extremely pure (remember One Piece in this sense) that does not match the latest productions of Gainax (with the exception of perhaps Diebuster): in Gurren the Studio tries their best to tell a story extremely positive, bright, boiling the blood-is as an antithesis of Evangelion.\n-Characters-\nThe cast features some of the most best ever seen in recent years, with big names like Kamina (\"do not believe in yourself. Believe me, I believe in you \"), Kittan (\" no, this is my soul! You will regret it! \"), Simon (\" my drill is one that PIERCES the HEAVENS! \"), just to name the most unbelievable (after all, we still have Viral Genome, Dayakka-\" My wife is the best of the universe-SWING! \").\nHeroes who face the impossible again and again, like real men. The psychological development of some of them (Simon, to quote) is monstrous: the series managed to combine and traces of human \"weaknesses\" with the \"iconic\" of characters (courage to sacrifice himself when necessary, never retreat, and other elements worthy of legends).\n-Style-\nCouncil to watch this anime: turn off your brain. One of the best quotes of the anime is \"Go beyond the impossible and kick the logic to corner\" (Kamina), and this is often taken in a sense more than literal. Gurren Lagann is about ridiculously scenes with epic songs -Sung playing in the background (and I know that many of us love this type of scene, feeling rather lack thereof in the current anime), is about characters screaming attack names aloud, and gigantic explosions. If you allow \"get in the mood\", you will be taken to an unbelievable journey. And smile like a fool, knowing you made the right decision.\n-Technical Issues-\nThe animation is jaw-dropping. To get an idea, 40% of the money used in the production were dedicated to the last 5 episodes, creating sequences that make many films out there go shame. The soundtrack contributes with the light/climate: epic songs sung, rap and Opera hybridizes to give a special glow to several of the best scenes of the series (many of these will be marked for those that see).\nPerhaps the only factor of production that is worth being criticized is the episodes \"reprise\" (there are two of them, a long piece of episode 6 and episode 16 integer), but it is worth remembering that this is part of the \"joke\" that Gainax proposed to do, saying that \"kick the logic to corner\" with this series: 27 episodes rather than 26, the protagonist being voiced by a man (many of the previous, as Shinji Ikari of Eva, were dubbed by women), etc.\n\"you're praising too! You're exaggerating! \"-\nI 'M. But as I said earlier, this is an anime that does not allow cold and calculating analysis. The very premise, the first episode, it doesn't make much sense. It is a classic \"love or hate\". Or you enter the atmosphere of \"OW MAN, WAY TOO EPICNESS\" or so says \"This is not my type.\" Despite the success that had (yielding promises of future projects), Gurren Lagann is not for everyone.\nIt's about courage.\nDramatic sacrifices.\nStruggles that make the DBZ characters seem Wimpy\nIt's about heroic speeches and exaggerated.\nIf you are unable to watch something that cannot lead to seriously, I recommend more sober, more series \"feet-in-the-ground\".\nIf you are willing to embark with the crew of the Gurren-Dan, welcome to war.\nFor freedom.\nBy the human race.\nThrough The Universe.\nTo quote the slogan of a well-known epic film: \"Prepare for glory\".\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=893,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    Perhaps no other show I have viewed have I gone into with higher expectations and hype than with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.  Practically everyone I know has told me about how awesome it is, how its epic ending is the best thing since the invention of the internal combustion engine.  Looking back I suppose that made it inevitable for me to be let down and disappointed.\nA message to the rabid fanboys probably is in order.  If you are incapable of accepting anyone’s opinion that differs from your own then you might as well stop reading this right now.  What follows is\n          \n        a critical and perhaps a bit harsh analysis of a series that at its best was one of the best things I have ever seen, but at its worst made me want to punch a hole in my television.  I certainly did not hate TTGL.  I can clearly recognize its achievements and its place in anime history and its influence.  But it also has some unforgivable warts that many of which were unnecessary.  It's typical of a GAINAX project which always seems to be high on presentation and build up and piss poor at conclusions.\nThere is nothing remarkable about the story in TTGL.  It borrows from familiar themes and unfolds in a pretty predictable and formulaic manner.  It’s the presentation of the storyline that makes it so unique from most anime of this type.  TTGL is really two anime in one.  The series is divided into two major story arcs.  Both are full of balls out macho testosterone filled awesomeness.  The scale of the story grows exponentially as each battle and each Gurren Lagann transformation becomes more and more epic.  Taken at that, TTGL succeeds at an unrivaled level.  The first arc has a perfect mix of comedy, tragedy, drama, and GAR.  I loved it.  It totally worked at every level. Until...\nWhere things start to come undone is in the second arc which starts at episode 16 and is set seven years after those events.  The feeling is totally different.  First you’re trying to get used to characters that have grown up, at least physically, and a setting that is completely alien to the apocalyptic wastelands of the first half of the series.  But where things unravel is that it starts to get away from what made the early parts of the series so successful.  It begins more of a romance arc, which you expected given the way things went in the first part and frankly I would have been disappointed if this hadn’t developed.  However it’s so ridiculous that all it does it make you think the characters are completely retarded.  I mean seriously, how can you be in a relationship with someone for seven fucking years and never kissed that person?  Really?  You expect me to take this seriously or actually care?  The second is the addition of a political drama that does about as much for the story as the unrealistic romance elements.  All it does it take a cast that was almost entirely likeable from the first half and make half of them asshats and douche bags.\nEventually though things get back on track with what made the show so completely awesome before.  The problem is by time they do will you be so angry and pissed off that you even care anymore?  That was the situation I found myself in.  As much as I wanted to be angry at it the feelings I had for it do start to pop up again.  The battles are even more epic and literally galaxy shattering.   It’s so totally masculine that I am surprised I didn’t grow a pair of balls myself.  But... it seems I always have to say that, just as it manages to redeem itself and make me swoon with delight; GAINAX delivers their final fuck you to the audience and frankly, it is unforgivable.  Sadly it completely ruined any enjoyment I had for it.\nTTGL characters are pretty much what you would expect from shounen anime.  However it manages to carve out a few legendary ones.  Pretty much anyone who is a fan of anime knows who Simon, Kamina, and Yoko are.  I can say that they aren’t overrated by the fandom either.  Kamina is pure awesomeness.  A man’s man and a woman’s dream.  His single minded determination and love for his comrades makes him the kind of friend that any man would want.  While he may not be \"husband material\" to us girls every one of us would want to put our arm in his and be protected by him.  He’s the kind of guy that can really only survive in a world of conflict.  A true hero for the ages.\nSimon has many of Kamina's traits.  As the main protagonist in the series he does well to overcome the obstacles in front of him.  I loved him, as a boy.  It was after the time skip that he has grown up that he becomes less interesting as a character.  He evolves into something he’s not, a virtual clone of Kamina that they are almost indistinguishable from one another.  The weaknesses and more reserved nature of the younger Simon which made him for me a much more real and interesting character disappear.  Instead of the thoughtful and cowardly boy we have a guy who is as reckless as Kamina ever was and goes into everything with all guns blazing and damn the torpedoes!  Its so uncharacteristic of him that it takes away from his character.  The final events of the story in particular are needless cruel and unnecessary and a further example of how out of character he has become.  By the end he is Kamina, complete with the ending you would have expected of him and all traces of the likeable kid all but erased.\nYoko is the ship that launched a million wet dreams from boys and probably a few grown men alike.  You might think that a character with eye popping measurements that spends the majority of the series in a bathing suit would be simply a tool for exploitive fan service.  But that’s not the case, as she really shines on her own and manages to be sexy without feeling like she’s just a prop.  Yoko is one of the few characters in the story to actually grow up.  She takes on responsibility as opposed to the rest of the cast who seem intend on riding the coattails of their past glories instead of contributing something to society.  Overall though she's treated poorly by the story and while she is very important to the first part of the series it’s almost like she became just another face in the crowd later on.  Being a big fan of hers I found that to be particularly disappointing.\nThe rest of the main and supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag.  The reason my score of them as a total suffers is that the vast majority of them are very static and unchanging.  Most of them are not all that interesting and are more like the background.  With few exceptions when one of them dies in the story's epic death count you are left with little emotional reaction because you didn’t feel anything for them when they were alive.  The time jump also affected my enjoyment of them as I mentioned many of them had total personality changes that really had no justification.  Some initially charming and interesting characters such as Nia I found myself just despising or becoming apathetic towards.\nOne thing that TTGL does not fail to deliver though is heart pounding and eye-popping visual effects and artwork.  This series is truly a masterful work of art.  Everything about it screams epic goodness.  GAINAX always has a bit of a unique and cartoony art style.  But what I really love is the bright colors and quirky designs.  It totally works for this series perhaps like no other ever has.  This is truly an achievement that I can find absolutely no flaws with.\nNot to be outdone, the musical score and voice acting is just as exceptional.  The actors manage to bring out all the macho characters and the often screaming dialogue and make it all work.  The music is some of the best I have heard in an anime.  The OP/EN themes rock hardcore and will have you moving your feet and singing out loud.\nSo did I like TTGL?  The answer is yes.  Did I enjoy it?  Not really.  Because of that it just can’t go down as one of my favorite series as it really should have thanks to that retardation at the end.  I know I am going to be in the minority here.  The story is not meant to be taken seriously and for the most part I didn’t.  However I was expecting more and I didn’t get it.  Chances are if you’re male, and under the age of 30 you just might watch this and think it’s the best thing ever.  For us girls your experience may vary.  It’s definitely worth the viewing but beware the trap of unrealistic expectations and hype.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=853,  ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    The show that turns boys into men.\nGurren Lagann was breathtaking. An endlessly thrilling ride from the most humble beginnings to the most fantastic of ends. Absolutely inspiring and a must-watch. There are so many memorable moments in this series, and lines and ideas that it imprints into your very soul. \nI will admit this is one of the first anime I had ever watched, except Miyazaki films. And its ridiculousness shocked me as a newcomer. Even so, I was enraptured, drawn by the infectious energy and the constant adrenaline rush from this show.  \nBecause it was unique. It was so very unique.\nTengen Toppa, while\n          \n        it does have an amazing story, is not about the story. It's not about a logical progression, strategy, conflicts of interests, world building, exploring the sci-fi or the other ideas in it. In fact,  it is about the deconstruction of all those things. I usually like smart anime. But Tengen Toppa is unique,  managing to be good without trying to be smart. Because it isn't about being smart. Its about feeling. Everything else is just a plot device. Its abstract almost, like a legend or an epic. You don't need to believe it. TTGL takes your ideas and your expectations and says fuck you. The only one idea that matters is feeling and spirit. It delivers on an emotional level. A primal instinct; willpower, that adrenaline rush and madness that overcomes you as you resolve to beat an impossible challenge in pursuit of what you want. \nEvery aspect of the show work to arouse and reinforce this zeal in the viewer. Its art, with a clever use of angles, bold lines, exaggerated designs and at times simplified drawings personify its brazen self-confidence and panache. Its soundtrack oozes fearless charisma with a liberal use of  energetic horns, drums, opera, rap(!), violin ensembles, and forceful sound effects... all the while also reserving a soft, passionately delicate side for its emotional moments. Its vibrant characters(especially one of the manliest leads in anime I know, Kamina) are among the most unforgettable I've ever encountered, and how far they come by the end, and indeed how much they grow on you is amazing to behold. Every single one of them, in the span of 27 episodes(yes, TTGL hates norms, even season counts), manages to surprise you and show you the many faces of human nature. In a way, they are perfectly chosen to represent the show's central theme of the struggle between human \"spirit\" against the abyss of \"despair\".\nI like to think of Gurren Lagann now as at least in part, as a light hearted jab at various overused tropes in anime(such as copious amounts of fanservice, plot arcs that escalates from small to unbelievably huge and so so many more). Gurren Lagann takes every cliche trope there is and ramps it up to 11, in a way that it feels strangely new and enjoyable again. If I could describe this show in one word, it'd be \"ridiculous\"... and I don't mean that in a bad way in the slightest.\nThe blatant and ridiculous sexual innuendos everywhere(the Di-gurren has a gigantic dick for a hull for just one example), the in-your-face approach to fan service, the seemingly boundless main plot arc, the battles, the set pieces, those outrageous VILLAINS, Nia and her moeblob eyes, the cheesy dialogue(it actually seems to work quite well in TTGL for some reason although it wouldn't anywhere else), the over-the-top speeches and declarations, the attack names... the list goes on and on. It presents these obviously un-serious things in the most serious and cocksure way possible. And somehow... manages to be convincing. It shocks you and grabs your attention with nothing else other than its unique spirit and confidence. TTGL feels like its taking an adult and making him play pretend, dragging him about in a crazed rush, and learn again what its like to be mad with drive and child-like passion for your dreams.\nFor deus ex machinas, there were so many in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann I couldn't count them all. But it played into the show's theme \"Kick logic out and do the impossible\" perfectly. I didn't get the impression from the rest of the narrative that the show was taking itself very seriously at all(viewed as a parody, TTGL is pretty damn good), so they actually felt natural and strangely uplifting, instead of disappointing. \nTengen Toppa is also excellent at emotionally moving you. They even state in the anime itself, \"kick logic out... it's all about spirit!\" And it delivers. It will move you, fire you up, make you cry, laugh. But it will most definitely not intrigue you, or make you race the characters in deductive reasoning like in other shows. But it will leave you exhilarated regardless. \nAnd maybe... just maybe... etch itself into your memory for a long time to come. \nEDIT: Now, as much as I know it is strange to say now, right at the end, especially after(rightly!) emphasizing the ridiculousness so much, I think it is dishonest to give the impression that this is just a mindless show intended to make you scream. Believe it or not, how epic it manages to be despite the absurdity is actually the result of very clever writing, brilliant implementation and noticeably passionate production values and attention to detail. In fact, I would even say this is one of most subtly intricate and thoughtful series to come out in recent years. This doesn't take the form of philosophical debates and pretentious sci-fi however. In true TTGL(and Gainax) style, it defies expectations. Everything thats silly is in your face, and whats clever is hidden for those who care to look. \nIt takes the form of exquisite symbolism, subliminal homo-erotic rap, intricately interwoven themes which the show doesn't always spell out for you(as just one slightly spoilerific example; think about the mistakes of humanity. Think about the Elder in the Face-God Village or the Chief of Jiha village and compare population-control Rossiu and the Anti-Spirals to them... they all are driven by the same thing), the bitter contrasts of war and how they seem to fade once you actually understand the sides, how infectious and inspiring spirit is when it truly refuses to give in to cynicism... hell, when you've finished I actually encourage you to read this: http://wtf.animeblogger.net/?p=140 \nFor now, the rest of you: watch this show.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=842,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    Only on the rarest of occasions does an anime come along that truly grabs me and elevates itself above mere entertainment and into the realms of gripping television. Gurren Lagann did this with frightening ease, not with complexity or depth of its storyline, nor with its technical excellence, or innovation, but with its boldness, energy, sense of humour, and heart. Some people may be put off with the degree of silliness the show never ceases to deliver, or at least be deterred from becoming deeply invested in the plot or its characters, but being the sucker for just this kind of shameless splendour and over-the-top\n          \n        theatrics, I took to it with enthusiasm, and came out of it with a strong sense of appreciation for the fun that the show delivered from week to week. Gurren Lagann is the kind of series that you may scoff at while you&rsquo;re watching it, or laugh at its unapologetically ridiculous antics, but which still leaves you craving the next episode. I became so swept up in the show&rsquo;s passion and heavy-handed charm that I quickly learned to turn my brain off and just go along with the ride. And this is how Gurren Lagann is best enjoyed, with an open-mind and a desire to sit back and enjoy yourself; if you can&rsquo;t refrain from cynicism or pretentiousness, you likely won&rsquo;t enjoy the show. I also recommend that the series is not watched as marathon fodder, in fact I&rsquo;m not sure you can truly capture the same experience if you missed out on watching it on a week-by-week basis. \nBut the show is not just for action junkies and comedy fanatics; it may have more than its share of explosion-riddled skies, sexual innuendo and galaxy-sized mecha, but more than that the show is somehow able to endear the viewer to its characters through all the furore and anarchy of the plot - and it is not afraid to cash in on that either. The characters are all really fun to watch, each of them flamboyant and charismatic in their own peculiar way, and on top of that, the series weaves in a good amount of sincere character development almost without the viewer noticing. Kamina, in particular is instantly likeable and memorable as the unstoppable and inspired leader of the group that the show revolves around. His unquenchable determination and guts are what really caught me into the series to begin with - one cannot help but stand alongside the other characters in the show with their reverence for him. More than being a likeable gang, the characters are used to great dramatic effect; the show has a number of dramatic peaks over its course that won&rsquo;t easily fade from my memory. Simon&rsquo;s transformation from a cowardly underling of Kamina, to an empowered and confident hero is also a key part of the story, and it is handled acceptably, though not quite believably. For that type of theme, I defer to Eureka 7&rsquo;s development of its protagonist, Renton.\nFurthermore, the story itself, while inarguably simplistic, revolves around a strong moral core, with themes that are challenging at times and rousing at others. The use of metaphor is vastly overdone, but revelations further into the show made me appreciate the central &ldquo;drill&rdquo; metaphor a bit more. My actual interest in the plot varied throughout the series, starting off quite high with the intrigue of the mysterious new world and the immediate threat of the Beastmen, and cooling off until the post-timeskip story kicked in, which introduced a more serious and challenging feel to the series and hence boosted my interests once again. The pacing is probably my biggest complaint for the show, as the constant action, ironically, became tedious at times, particularly in the build-up to the climactic episode 15. The show may always have a sense of fun, but it is inconsistently gripping. \nThe animation, episode 4 aside (whose director was later fired - although that&rsquo;s another story), is brimming with vigour and vitality; it is not always consistent, and rarely very detailed, but it seems to adjust itself to the mood of the show in a very unsubtle but fitting manner. There were a number of blatant shortcuts that were used during many of the battle sequences that I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice, but given the &lsquo;epic&rsquo; nature of the show, it is difficult to expect top-class animation right the way through. At times, the art and animation are genuinely amazing, and there is no denying that this was an ambitious and costly undertaking by the usually self-preservational GAINAX. An extra boost of cel detail would have welcome but probably impractical from a budgetary perspective. \nThe music for the show is much like the show itself, in that it&rsquo;s hard to take seriously, but it is unavoidably engaging. Rather than cinematic type of score work, the show is packed with insert songs and a handful of key piece of theme music. I am appreciative of the way the music was distributed throughout the series, with new music being added to the mix right up until the end. This prevented it from stagnating. A few of the tracks are stand-out pieces of music, and are used in the show to give it a genuine boost of captivation and emotion. In particular, the main heroic theme of the show never fails to rouse me into a high-spirited love for the series.\nAt times powerful, almost always senselessly fun, and with a strong moral core top its themes and story, Gurren Lagann is the highlight of 2007, and an anime worthy of anyone&rsquo;s viewing. Far from flawless, yet somehow rarely flawed, this anime series is inexplicably lovable for those who are easily hooked in by unsubtle fun. Gurren Lagann has something for everyone, and as such I recommend it to everyone. However, I think it appeals more directly to a male audience with its badassery and male hero role models."},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=231,  ["text"]="                          \n    Gainax is easily one of the most well known anime studio, especially with titles like, Neon Genesis Evangelion, KareKano, and Wings of Honneamise.  However, as of late many fans claim that the quality of Gainax has dropped down significantly and that their golden age is over, well that was until Gurren Lagann.  Without a doubt Gurren Lagann took both Japanese and western fandom by storm.  This coupled with the fact that there was very little hype before hand thus, making the extreme popularity even more impressive.  For me what was more impressive was the fact that people that normally don&rsquo;t like\n          \n        this sort of thing (ie prefer more serious, dramatic works) enjoy it immensely.  This was what drove me to watch Gurren Lagann and write this review afterwards. \nGurren Lagann reminds me of another Gainax title, Gunbuster especially the last third.  GaoGaiGar was another anime as both GaoGaiGar and Gunbuster are unabashedly over-the-top and cheesy.  Not only that, it thrives in its cheesiness and over-the-top nature.  Also, one cannot claim that Gurren Lagann half-asses anything, it does everything with the same vigor and intensity.  At the same time this is what makes or breaks Gurren Lagann for most viewers.  Its cheesiness or over-the-top nature will strike a chord in you or (as some people put it) appeal to something more primal inside else you&rsquo;ll end up like me, facepalming.  This is something I cannot understand for the life of me.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that Gurren Lagann can be seen as a throw back to super robots/&rdquo;manly&rdquo; series of the seventies a direct contrast to the proliferation of so called &ldquo;sissy&rdquo; anime as of late.  However, it fails to achieve any more than that, a mindless, over-the-top mecha/action series.  Now whether or not that&rsquo;s a bad thing is up to you.\nThe story and structure was distinctly shounen thus, suffering from a high degree of predictability.   First, you have a powerful opponent yet against all odds the protagonists defeat them.  Then another more powerful opponent pops up and yet again against all odds the protagonists defeat them, usually by some kind of power up.  Keep on repeating till there are no more enemies left. Many of the characters are also the embodiment of your typical shounen protagonist, energetic idiots that keep running forward destroying every obstacle in their way.  This was accomplished with very little thought when it comes to probability, strategy, and even logic.  It keeps on this monotonous path until the time skip.\nHere the cheesiness and its shounen nature are reduced significantly.  The characters and setting are also different and quite interesting.  However, at the same time I can see the characters mature/grow in that manner.  I was pleasantly surprised by this turn of events and for a fleeting moment thought that Gurren Lagann would redeem itself in my eyes.  Sadly it was nothing more than that, a fleeting moment, as it went back to its same old self, magnified 10 times, a few episodes later.  It is ironic that for the overall review of Gurren Lagann, I lowered the score due to the fact that&rsquo;s it was out of place.  Consistency is very important in my books.  If they had kept with the same seriousness until the end, then it would have rated Gurren Lagann higher.  \nIf my favorite part was after the time skip then my least favorite part would the very beginning, the first arc (ep 1-8).  This arc was easily the silliest and dumbest of Gurren Lagann.  I can easily see why so many people dropped it during this arc.  Not only was it stupid but slow.  It took forever for me to get through these episodes as I couldn&rsquo;t watch more than one episode at a time.  If I had to rate this arc alone it would probably get 3 out of 10.  Thankfully, after all the mandatory character introductions it starts to really move.  By the 2nd arc (ep 9-16) the episodes seamlessly blended together as the overall flow/pacing was much better.  Also, idiotic filler such as the onsen episode were gone and the stupidity in the name of comedy was reduced a little bit.   Yes, I still find it stupid and over-the-top but at least it had a fast pace and somewhat enjoyable, because of this I could watch multiple episodes in one sitting.  This arc would get a 6 or 7 out of 10 and the 3rd arc would be a 5 out of 10.       \nAs for the characters, I mentioned that most of crew are energetic idiots and Kamina was the worst one of them all, as well as being the shallowest (character-wise) of the main characters.  All he had was &ldquo;guts&rdquo; and confidence that was completely baseless.  He said it himself, Simon was the one that saved him countless times, and it was Simon that had the ability, not Kamina.   However, not all of characters are like this (shallow I mean), in fact there was a decent amount of characterization and those characters were quite interesting in their own right.  Yoko was an awesome side character that was far more than a fanservice character, Simon developed quite nicely throughout the series, Viral was an incredibly sympathetic beastman, etc.  I could go on but I think you get the idea.  Perhaps this is why I really enjoyed the episodes after the time skip, as there was a lot of focus on the characters themselves and not on the next battle.  Sadly, Gurren Lagann didn&rsquo;t focus enough on the characters.  This brings me to my next point, the ending and the epilogue.\nThe ending just didn&rsquo;t feel right considering the overall tone and feel of the series.  Interestingly enough, I actually thought the epilogue hurt the ending.  This is considering how much I love epilogues.  Spoilerish comments hidden&hellip;\n  In particular, Simon being a wanderer and Nia dying are two things I didn&rsquo;t expect.  Nia dying really didn&rsquo;t make much sense to me and even if there is logic behind it, it still doesn&rsquo;t feel right considering the series.  While I can accept that, what Simon did feels really forced.  He&rsquo;s saying he&rsquo;s tired/done fighting and left everything to the new generation.  I can understand the idea they&rsquo;re trying to get across.  With him leaving everything to the new generation at such an early age, albeit forced, reinforces the idea.  If it ended right there then it would be a perfectly good ending.  However, with the epilogue I was forced to take his decision more literal.  He&rsquo;s only around 20 years old and he&rsquo;s already done everything he can in his life!?  While I don&rsquo;t see him leading epic space battles, I don&rsquo;t see him being a wanderer either.  Perhaps a mentor to reinforce the idea of the child surpassing the parent.\nSince this is an action series, animation is of considerable importance.  Gurren Lagann thankfully delivers, and features well animated giant robot action.  However, as I stated above I put a lot into consistency and quite often there was be a dip in art/animation after an explosive episode.  For example, there was some noticeable weakness in the art in episode 9, which was after the huge battle in episode 8.  In general, there were some fluctuations in terms of art/animation throughout the series.  As for the art it was unique, but fits with its extreme shounen and silly feel.  The only thing that bothers me about the art was the slight lack of detail.  However, I really can&rsquo;t complain too much about the art. \nGurren Lagann was over-the-top, silly, and corny mecha anime.  However, it did it with so much gusto it can be seen as a plus for some.  This is why I think some people that normally like serious/dramatic/intelligent anime also enjoy this.  For me it was simply too silly, too corny, too much.  Its blatant shounen nature didn&rsquo;t help either.  Thankfully, the characters fared a bit better as not all of them were overly energetic idiots.  Those characters received quite a bit of characterization and are fairly likeable.  This was what saved Gurren Lagann from being dropped again.  Sadly they didn&rsquo;t spend nearly enough time on those characters and moments like the dream sequence in ep 26 are far and few in-between.  In the end it all boils down to whether or not one can accept its over-the-top and extremely corny nature.      \n        "},

To be honest i would have never thought that i would enjoy a show where you can find excesive and overadrenaline fights. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann called my atention just because of the very commotion of being such a overrated anime, or people calling it trash. Turned out that i was wrong to think that this anime would be a waste.\nFrom unexpected shouts of wars to supergalactic fights that our imagination never would manage to have, we have Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, a plot\n          \n        that brings the story of a man who tries to forge his own destiny with the company of his friends. Sounds very simple isn't? It is indeed, but just because it is simple it doesn't mean it lacks of complexity and it still will be of easy understanding. The plot revolves in a very simple way, we can see the two main characters standing in a world they don't quite feel comfortable with. What would you do if you were on their shoes? On the surface this seems like a fairly straightforward plot and you may be wondering what's so special about it. And that's part of it, the story is a straightforward tale of two dreamers and the path they take.\nWith zero weapons, zero plans and a lot of guts, our main heroes try to grasp this first dream; reach the surface.\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann wasn’t really about being deep or carrying serious issues -although the themes dearest to Gainax, such as the adolescent growing and the contrast between reality and dreamworld, make an appearance; I think it nevertheless was a compelling story, and also not too much predictable -Sure, it is a Super Robot anime, the hero has to win every time no matter how it is unrealistic and predictable; but if its predictable moments are compelling and carried with style, they just succeed- no matter if you like it or not.\nOne of gurren lagann's advantage is a story that could be told in 27 episodes without something like fillers or other annoying things. Why advantage? Because Gurren Lagann didn't have enough time to pause and remind everyone their past and showing weaknesses and long ass monologues every episode.\nI wouldn't say that Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a masterpiece on terms of artwork and animation, The Cartoony yet ambitious style is why it fits so well. This is because even though it doesn't look serious, it takes it self seriously. Yet in the other hand, the 'draw' efect that some episodes has is just incredible on itself, you will be really pleased with the changes that the time-skip this series had. Also when things get hectic and packed with alot of action the art changes to being very epic looking. Especially the scenes where they take a break half way through the anime.\nIt is indeed very stylish and artistic. I didn't seem -in my opinion- perfect, because it didn't seem to go above and beyond. It was very well done, but still seemed within the realms of 'safe'.\nThe sound in itself fits so well, from the long battles scenes to even the dramatic moments, the music is just, is just incredible in all the sense of the word, you won't be disappointed and therefore pleased you will be. The opening is inspiring in all ways, from the very first AMV to the last one, Sorairo Days will be on my mind always as one of the soundtracks most enjoyable ever and of course without leaving behind the ending,\"Minna no Peace\", wich suits perfectly for such fantastic season. The hardcore songs in the middle of the battle will make you scream! Even to the point that it will give you the chills of how epic the music is! Believe me that the soundtracks of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the very embodiment of exitement.\nWell setup and mechas are two important ingredients of a good Giant Robot show, but any anime ultimately lives or dies based on its characters, and on this count, Gurren Lagann doesn't disappoint.\nYoko almost has no purpose other than to fulfill the requirement for X amount of boobs in an anime. People may hate me for saying this, but she's only there to balance the testosterone with estrogen. She saved Simon and Kamina countless of times, yes, but she didn't moved too much the plot. (Hurts me to say this because i love her). Kamina in a lot of ways is the living embodiment of the series its spirit and he's loudly outspoken, supremely confident in his and Simon's abilities and believes so much in his dream, his friends and his own ability that he comes up with some crazy ideas. I don't want to say too much for fear of spoiling the surprise, but Kamina, with his boundless 'machismo' and optimism, is an energetic and charismatic enough character that soon he has inspired humans all across the surface to join his banner and fight against their mysterious oppressors, the beastmen. And although Simon comes close to the whining protagonist archetype that bugs me so much, Kamina's presence and his own inner reserves force him to come through in the clinch and ultimately make him a much more likeable character.\nOther than Simon's growth and development, though, the characters just aren't that interesting. You may argue that they're a perfect balance of different character personalities, but they really do nothing other than one thing (ugly button pushing nerd, grunting twins, dumb three useless sisters, conveniently placed old man, mindless battalion leaders, etc, etc).\nEnjoyment? Do I need words to express this? To be honest, my first impression was really bad, thought that really changed as i saw every episode. This is, in my opinion, one of the most enjoyable series out there. All the explosions keep you at the edge of your seat wanting more and more. The story flows smoothly without an episode wasting its time on petty things. You will love each one of the elements on this series, his action, his drama, his comedy and even romance.\nEmotionally, Gurren Lagann is all about self-belief, confidence and optimism; after all, that is 'spiral energy', an unrelenting, blood boiling ambition to succeed; even when all seems lost, dare to have hope and god dammit, believe in yourself.\n\"Who the hell do you think i am?\".\nIndeed, without a doubt such words will stay on our memories forever as one of the war shouts more surprisings that an enemy could have.\nOverall no other anime has ever crossed the line to make itself this predictable. Don’t you guys see? It’s this stupendous mash up of predictable and generic plot elements that also make this anime one of the most original animes I’ve ever seen.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=176,  ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I just finished watching TTGL about a few days ago, and let me tell you all, this anime isn't rated #1 for nothing.\nNow because there are already reviews that I couldn't hope to outwrite already posted on this page, let's assume that I agree with all of the positive ones. What I hope to do is give an image of what to expect by addressing some of the negative comments about the anime.\nFirst off, some people say 'This anime is way too cliche, it doesnt work for me cause theres nothing new'. This is completely understandable, because usually the cliche can breach the lines of\n          \n        corny and become, well, cliche. The thing is, I am REALLY into the whole 'if you think you can do it, you can' mentality, and when you watch TTGL, keep in mind that that mindset is a focal point to the series. Personally, I think its great, and of course, EPIC. The characters are indeed cliche, and the story as well. But something about TTGL elevates these to such a level that you find yourself getting into the story, and attaching to certain characters. There were absolutely no major flaws in the plotline of this story, and the last episode left me tingling with enjoyment. The rewatch value of TTGL is immense; it's ridiculous.\nNext, people say 'This anime makes no logical sense, how can all this possibly happen?' Well, you're watching an anime, people. Do you expect it to be realistic? To be special, a story usually has to be unrealistic, if not romantic. Ignore that the events of this show could not possibly exist, and enjoy the moment. It really is fantastic.\nAlso, I wanna add this for people who are thinking about watching TTGL. You might think 'I don't really like mech animes' or 'I just watched evangelion, and everyone was depressed and it sucked!' I think both of those as well, and mech animes in general aren't that entertaining unless people can really relate to the characters. TTGL really blows down the boundary between your average mech anime and... well, everything else. If you dont like mech animes, watch this anyway.\nFinally, some people say 'This anime tries to be everything at once: Funny, serious, crazy, it just doesnt work!' Well if you are a seasoned anime watcher, you should know that it works great for an anime to be funny and serious at the same time, and as I already mentioned, pretty much every anime is hard to believe. I'll bet some of the people that didnt like TTGL because it was unrealistic didnt even give Death Note a second thought, both of which are pretty darn unrealistic. But who cares about that anyway? Just sit back and enjoy!\nAnyway, my thoughts: Perfect anime. This is one of the ONLY animes I have seen that has a proper end, and leaves nothing unanswered. Basically, every time you think you can withstand the awesome, another wave hits you and you gape in awe at the screen. It's almost never negative, always with a 'get up and believe in yourself' attitude throughout. You do not want to miss this cliche yet somehow amazingly captivating series.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=139,  ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I was basically forced into watching TTGL by my brother, and I'm ever so grateful because I, like many others, had not experienced true epicness until I saw this series.\nSTORY - The story for Gurren Lagann seems very modest at first glance. That's very misleading though, as it eventually becomes quite grand and all-encompassing. Simon and Kamina just wanted to break out of the underground and see what was on the surface, but they got so much more than that... It's amazing to me just how far the story goes between episode 1 and episode 27 (is it 27 episodes because it was just way\n          \n        too amazing to fit into 26? I think so). The characters' goals at the beginning and end of the series can't even be compared, and yet, the progression happens incredibly smoothly... so smoothly that you don't even realize how different everything's become until it's all done and over. I find astonishingly impressive. It totally floored me.\nGurren Lagann's story also makes it accessible to a very wide audience, which I also find impressive. Mecha and shounen fans get a great deal of fighting and big robots (really, really big robots...). Shoujo fans get a substantial bit of romance and plenty of general cuteness. There's great general adventure for everyone else, and even moe fans have something to look forward to! The only real catch is that there's a lot of stuff that's just silly and over-the-top. It doesn't take long to realize that TTGL is a rather ridiculous series that can be difficult to take seriously at times -- but that's fine because it's all in good and clever self-mockery (gar is the fuel source of the universe!). Besides, the sillier bits just make the more serious sides more amazing. I love it when a series manages to be outrageous and poignant all in the same breath; it's definitely something that takes skillful storytelling. And satire fans will get a big kick out of all the madness. \nGurren Lagann also manages to do a lot of things you don't normally see in anime. Romantic relationships are actually confirmed and canonized. People die. Important people die. There is a timeskip that doesn't suck. There is a fanservice character that's actually pretty cool and substantial! The bad guys aren't completely one-sided! That's a lot of pretty refreshing stuff!\nCHARACTER - There is only one character in Gurren Lagann that you probably won't like, but that's okay because you're not supposed to like him anyway (the backstabbing bastard!). The protagonists are fantastic at garnering audience support and sympathy. Kamina is the manliest man in the world and has enough gar to power nuclear reactors. Despite being Shinji-like and overly emo initially, Simon is very easy to relate to and you just can't help but cheer him on every step of the way. Yoko and Leeron are both fantastic support characters that have quirky habits (and they're also there to poke lots of fun at anime stereotypes). Even the antagonists are fun people! Viral is just... probably the most pathetic villain you ever did see, but so much that you seriously just feel bad for the guy. He tries hard! Very hard! It isn't even that he isn't skilled! He just... can't win against the good guys because they're good! And his superiors are all unique and memorable fellows that put up good, entertaining fights. \nAdmittedly, few of these characters have deep, probing psychological complexes -- they are simple people with simple goals, but this doesn't necessarily make them one-dimensional. Simon grows a great deal throughout the course of the series, something that's really accented by the timeskip. He's easy to understand, which really adds to his likability as a character. Yoko and Viral are two other characters that really benefited from the timeskip: both develop in somewhat unexpected and interesting ways. The two of them answer the questions of 'what does a fanservice girl do after the war?' and 'what does a bad guy do when his team loses?' -- two questions that aren't often addressed in other series. Some of the developments are a bit tongue-in-cheek, but overall, they're pretty interesting. And actually, though it isn't obvious at first, there is a question of morals and ethics presented in Gurren Lagann. It can be as deep as you want it to be, or as simple as you want; maybe the ability for you to choose and be satisfied either way is another grand merit of the show.\nARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - Excluding the infamous episode 4, the animation is pretty nice all the way through. The art style's interesting and fun, and while it isn't anything amazing, it does the job. Now... episode 4. I've heard a lot of reasons why, but the fact is just that there was someone different animating that episode, and it looks awful.The style is completely different; the characters look pretty retarded, and it's just lackluster all around. Don't worry though. Episode 5 is back to normal, and you never see it again! &lt;_&lt;\nAlso, Gurren Lagann also sports some of the most innovative mecha designs I've ever seen. In a way, they're a mockery of every other kind of mecha out there just because they're absolutely ridiculous. The whole 'combining' thing is especially 'what the hell???'-inducing. It really gets out of hand after a while...but in a good way though, I assure you.\nMUSIC - Gurren Lagann has some pretty epic music. It isn't often you hear opera and rap mixed together for your final boss battle theme. 'Libera me' is probably the most heralded track in the series, but for good reason! It's fantastically done and does well to boost your excitement levels for the corresponding scenes. The rest of the music is also pretty amazing, and I'd definitely recommend getting your hands on the soundtrack if you can. The battle themes and unique tracks like Viral's theme are just very memorable and fun to listen to, even if you're not watching the series. Additionally, all of the OP/ED themes for the series were great. I'm especially fond of the opening as it seems to capture the spirit and energy of Gurren Lagann very well. It'll also get stuck in your head for days.\nVOICE ACTING - The Japanese voice cast is top notch. Kamina's voice is the perfect amount of epic for his character, which is very impressive considering his gar fuels the entire show. Simon's voice also fits perfectly throughout his many mood swings, and it's hard to imagine anyone being able to replicate Viral's strange voice. Like most others, I was incredibly skeptical about the dub. ADV's cast seemed lackluster, and I balked at the idea of Vic Mignogna as Viral. Bandai's cast, however, was nothing short of WTF... mostly because of Steve Blum's role as Leeron. In general, Bandai's list had a lot more talented names on it, and I actually looked forward to the dub's big premiere on Sci-fi. \nFor the most part, I wasn't disappointed. Kyle Hebert as Kamina takes a little getting used to -- it's true, he's not as manly as Katsuyuki Konishi, but he does a pretty damn good job anyway. I was the most impressed by Yuri Lowenthal as Simon though. The voice is perfect and Yuri doesn't sound anything like his other prominent roles (it's very easy to forget he's also Sasuke and Suzaku). The rest of the cast isn't nearly as great, but they don't bomb their roles either. I'm not a big fan of Michelle Ruff and think most of her voices are pretty generic; Yoko isn't an exception. Johnny Yong Bosch as Rossiu is kind of hilarious because unlike Yuri, Johnny's voice is reminiscent of his other roles. Hynden Walch as Nia is a bit too cute for me. She sounds exactly like Starfire, but while Starfire's personality is very fitting to Nia's, I just find the voice in general to be way too high-pitched. Viral also isn't that great, but ah well. Like I said, none of them are nearly bad enough to make me go screaming in the other direction.\nOh, and Steve Blum as Leeron? Fabulous. (The voice is a little stereotypical, but it's fabulous nonetheless.)\nOVERALL - It's hard to dispute TTGL's sheer epicness, and I think it's a pretty awesome series for both the newcomer to anime and the longtime veteran. You just have to have a sense of humor and the ability to embrace the ridiculousness that will be thrown your way. Live a little, laugh a little, right? Everyone I know came away with the same reaction as me. This is one of those series that after you see it, you will become gripped with the need and desire to share it with everyone you know. So be it. ;3\nBelieve me when I say I don't give overall scores of 10 very often.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=135,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    'Who the hell do you think I am?!'\nA now famous quote that is Kamina's battle cry, Simon's battle cry, and arguably the show's battle cry. Gurren Lagann is a show that screams this in every way, shattering all limitations placed upon the constraints of its world. In doing so, it becomes what is arguably the most epic anime on the map today, in every sense of the word.\nGurren Lagann is an epic story, because the narrative actually is the layout of classic epic poetry. A vast limitless setting to journey across, passionate speeches, and heroes that embody the hopes and dreams of entire civilizations. It\n          \n        is a tried-and-true formula that Lagann follows to the letter. This is especially enjoyable for people such as myself, who need more... much much more, to even consider watching a 'mecha' anime. In telling the story as it does, Gainax yet again reinvents the mecha anime. Bravo.\nUnfortunately, epics tend to tell the story of one man, not a whole cast. Lagann however has a huge cast of supporting characters, and many of them are hardly necessary to the plot and do nothing but chew (or in this case, blow up) the scenery. The only real key characters to the story are Kamina, Simon, and Nia... yes, Yoko really is just a pair of boobs and a gun. Disagree all you want but tell me how she significantly moved the plot... that's what I thought. So it goes for the majority of the cast in terms of development and usefulness. If the three mentioned aren't on screen, it's kind of hard to care about what's going on. Regardless, this flaw is relatively minor in terms of series quality and the characterization of the three key players is still outstanding.\nLagann is animated expertly by the infamous veteran studio Gainax. A studio known for inventive directing, and this series is no exception. Animation is jerky and sketchy, but given the sheer energy of the material and it's unbridled force, it works and it works perfectly. You may not like the look of it, but that doesn't mean it's not appropriate. Only one episode of the bunch really stands out in quality, but it is a one-time slip... still it is a massive slip so points need to be taken off for it. Everything else is Grade-A material.\nThe journey of Gurren Lagann is accompanied by Taku Iwasaki's soundtrack. The use of rap doesn't always work, but the majority of the music is not rap, and does well to highlight the epic nature of the series with swelling brass, snare drums, and even opera. The sum of it sounds like a grand call to war, which fits the series perfectly. Shoko Nakagawa's opening song and insert song always do a great job of pumping up the viewers, but I feel mixed about the ending themes. They're not bad, but they don't really add anything.\nSo here we are at review's end. To be frank, very frank, when I finished Gurren Lagann I felt like my soul had had an orgasm. The passionate dialogue and grandiose animation are rhetorically dynamic. You feel what Simon feels, you want what Simon wants, and you go through it all with a deep sense of satisfaction. Gurren Lagann is a genius anime, but it is also a respectable triumph in general entertainment, anime or otherwise.\nOverall, I give Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann a 9 out of 10.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=131,  ["text"]="                          \n    Your review is the review that will pierce the public opinion!\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is an over the top, in your face show that is fast paced, fun, and almost nonsensical at times. The opinion on this show is split right down the middle. Many people love it to death, while others go as far as to say that it is a non-functioning piece of garbage. My rating may seem too harsh to those aforementioned diehard fans, but there is reasoning behind it. This is mainly because I found the first \"half\" to be uniquely crazy and exciting. However, I felt that the final eleven\n          \n        episodes simply took this craziness too far. It went from a sui generis comedic mecha to a copy and paste shounen that was repetitive, and at some points even obnoxious.\nWhile I am not going to reveal specific plot details, I will discuss how the story is laid out. The story is split into two parts: the first \"half\" being episodes one through sixteen and the second \"half\" seventeen through twenty seven. I really enjoyed the first half and found it to be, as I mentioned before, uniquely crazy and exciting. However after defeating the \"invincible\" bad guy boss (who is supposedly the epitome of evil), a completely different, and even more impossibly powerful one is revealed. This is where the series went stale for me. \nThe battles became repetitive and the inspirational speeches became meaningless. Everything was happening over and over again, just on a bigger scale each time. I do suppose this is quite symbolic, because as you go down a drill, it does the same thing; a repeating cycle that grows bigger and bigger. The whole shtick of the show was to \"break through the impossible with your drill\", but even if there is meaning behind it, this routine grew quite tiresome. \nBesides the story lacking in depth, there were not really any other problems. The art was always beautiful and explosive, with a good soundtrack to back it up. Even the characters, while being very shounen-esque, were able to develop throughout the series and become better versions of themselves. However, decent characters and a splendid art and music combination are not enough to make a series great. There needs to be a solid story as well, and in my opinion this is where TTGL fails. \nIn the end, I could not bring myself to give the series a 4 or lower, yet I thought that 7 or above would be too generous. So I scored it like this: 8/10 for the first half, and 3/10 for the second half. Thus I figured that the final score should be somewhere in between, and I stuck with 5. I genuinely enjoyed the first half and I still wish it had ended there with perhaps an episode afterwards to give some closure. The second half left nothing to the imagination and just kept repeating the same cycle again and again until the series was run into the ground."},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=118,  ["text"]="                          \n    	First of all, I'd like to point out that I do not normally watch anime about mecha. That being said, I found Gurren Lagann to be a fresh look at the genre, and one that was quite entertaining as well. Unfortunately, I do think the show has been slightly overrated (being ranked #1 on this site at the time of writing) and for this reason my expectations upon starting Gurren Lagann were somewhat higher than they should have been. I'd have probably enjoyed the show more if I'd gone in with my usual attitude toward anime of this genre and been pleasantly surprised rather than\n          \n        mildly disappointed.\n	My main reason for writing this review therefore is for those like me who might otherwise watch this show without regard to the fact that it still follows many the typical shounen mecha tropes that made me dislike this genre in the first place. However, this is not meant to be a critical review of the genre in general but of Gurren Lagann in particular, so let me emphasize that no matter what your preconceptions of this type of anime may be, I still believe that this show is worth watching.\n	Gurren Lagann is primarily a coming-of-age story. The main character, Simon, begins the story as a young boy who is unsure of himself and largely dependent on his older brother Kamina. As the story progresses however, Simon is forced to with situations where his brother can no longer protect him. Simon must therefore learn to become a hero in his own right if he is to survive in the dangerous world in which he finds himself.\n	The story progression is fast paced and the characters undergo changes with each episode, so it was definitely much more than the mecha-battle-of-the-week show that generally turns me off toward this genre, as I mentioned previously. The story has a few good plot twists and most of the characters make a meaningful contribution to the story (with the exception of Yoko who is mostly fanservice, though even she is given an interesting subplot toward the end of the series.) Although the plot can be somewhat silly at times, especially in the beginning, it is offset by serious moments and the mood of the show can change in an instant.\n	The biggest complaint I have about the story is the overextension of the technology/science around which the entire plot is centered. The technology involves a (metaphoric?) relationship to drills, which I felt was somewhat strange and could at least have been better explained. I tend to make a big deal about this sort of thing, so I expect others will disagree with me, but I found the somewhat ridiculous extent to which the characters powers had evolved by the end of the series to be somewhat unbelievable based on the premises set down by the rest of the show. I realize that the evolution of main characters to demigod like status is widely accepted in anime (i.e. DBZ, Bleach, etc.) I just thought I should warn those who are mildly annoyed by this as I am.\n	That being said, the action scenes are rather well done, even those toward the end that involve large mecha hurling galaxy sized energy blasts at each other. The fights are greatly enhanced by a mostly techno/rap soundtrack, and the fast paced action, while not the best I&rsquo;ve seen, was more than enough to remain exciting throughout each battle. I even found myself enjoying some of the epic battles near the conclusion in spite of myself. These closing battles were quite attractive to look at and the operatic background music completed the feeling to create something that was actually quite enjoyable.\n	The animation is definitely not the most realistic, but instead uses a unique style that is still pleasing to look at most of the time. The simplicity of the artistic style combined with the bright colors are reminiscent of earlier shounen action anime, but somewhat more caricatured.\n	Overall, Gurren Lagann was well worth watching, and I&rsquo;d definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys mecha and fast paced action. Even if this type of thing isn&rsquo;t what you normally watch, this show is still worth a try. It is necessary to suspend disbelief at several points of the story, but the action is still quite enjoyable, so long as the viewer is not prone to over analyzing everything.    "},

Seriously, it wasn't that good.\nNow, my main peeve with Gurren Lagann is it's inability to decide what it wants to be. It stuffs as many genres as it can, rather sloppily, into a tiny package with little-to-no substance. So, in my quest to figure out the appeal, I found myself questioning various fans, who, as a whole, appear to have the same difficulty as the show.\n\"So, what's the appeal? I found it to be, among, the least enjoyable shows I've seen. What made such a stupid show so popular?\" I\n          \n        says.\n\"Well,\" nameless Gurren Lagann fan 1 replies, as-a-matter-of-factly, \"It's that Gurren Lagann wasn't meant to be smart. It's a parody.\"\n\"Huh? A parody? But it certainly wasn't very funny,\" I respond.\n\"Oh, that's because it's not about the comedy!\" exclaims Gurren Lagann fan 2! \"It's about the adrenaline. It's a full-blown bona-fide action show!\"\n\"Odd that you say that, I never once had adrenaline rise while watching GL. In fact, a good portion of the fights were snoozers, nearly fell asleep out of sheer repetition. The most exciting fight was the first one with Viral, and even then, I've felt my heart pound more intensely by watching two sleeping pandas duke it out.\"\n\"Oh, you're right about the fights,\" inquires Mr.3. \"But, that's because GL isn't an action series, it's all about the characters\" - What? The characters were so unoriginal it made my head hurt! - \"and their interactions!\"\n\"I'm not even going to go there. All the characters were weakly constructed.\"\n\"Kamina was the greatest character ever! That's why this show is so good! It's such a MANLY and EPIC series!\" retorts an angry 4.\n\"So, having the mental capacity of a toddler is 'MANLY' and 'EPIC'?\" I find myself asking.\n\"No! Everything was got really big! 'cause 'epic' means 'large'!\" declares Mr. 5. \n\"But.... in 4th grade I came up with somthing far bigger than anything in GL. It was called 'Chickennuggetzilla'. He was 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 miles on all sides, and was shaped like a chicken nugget. He was very angry and had magical ice breath. Ice breath that was on fire. And the ice would freeze anything it touched forever, while confusing it due to the immense heat at the same time. Isn't that about the same level as GL?\"\n\"You're dumb! That's not an insult, I'm stating that as a scientifically proven fact, although it clearly isn't and I'm actually the one who is stupid,\" explains 6, whom notable has fantasies of people brushing teeth with male genitals.\nAnd thus sums up the fanbase of Gurren Lagann. Not a very pleasant sight, very few are remotely tolerable.\nSo, in conclusion, I feel I should dress my baby brother up like Odysseus and film him as he beats up evil teddy bears with a stick and indicates to the viewer the location of ones nose and toes, post it on YouYube, and it'll become an instant success - as the World's most MANLY and EPIC adventure ever. Even more than Gurren Lagann.\nNow, enough of the rambling I suddenly felt the need to edit in, and on with the review:\nStory:\nOkay, so there's this dude and he digs a lot. It's, like, his job or something. Who knows why he's digging, and in a civilization that already lives underground, no less, simply making the whole \"We're going to dig\" that much dumber. So, he's an outcast and only one person likes him, but that guy happens to be an imbecile, so he doesn't count. So, we have a dude who hasn't got any balls and another whose balls have exploded from the overabundance of testosterone. Okay, then, this giant thing attacks the village and they use ball-less dude's silly robo-face - which he happens to have discovered not long ago. And they leave the village because..... actually, I don't really remember why, specifically, because Kamina was being too much of a dumbass to form a coherent explanation. And, somewhere along the lines, they discover boobs - really big, scantly clad boobs on a scantly clad lady - a scantly clad lady who's character was about as original as everything else in the whole bloody show, in other word, none of these characters took any talent to come up with. At all. And, as these characters are driving the story, the story manages to fall flat on it's lame, generic face. The plot is about these characters fighting against the evil king that has oppressed them to the underground. *twirls finger* How engrossing. Oh, and there's some stupid plot twist that leads up to the final handful of episodes. It's pretty stupid, but nobody watching really cared about the plot anyway.\nArt:\nArt? What art? There's nothing artistic about Gurren Lagann! It's GAINAX's pitiful attempt at making another FLCL! It tries to be outlandishly crazy, but it constantly to the exact same animation techniques as FLCL. The characters have cliche \"cool\" character designs; the backgrounds are nothing more than a bunch of rocks; the fights consist of someone hits their enemy who spins uncontrollaby through the air and crashes, then an overused power up sequence which gets add-ons later in the show, but it doesn't make a huge difference - there's an occasion where something gets an elongated limb, but it's still nothing interesting.\nSound:\nAverage quality. Nothing special. Voices were okay when they weren't yelling; when they yelled, it was usually done by an annoying character - which was often.\nCharacters:\nDo I even have to talk about those? They were lame. Simon was irritatingly lame - he's afraid of everything for the first half of the series, then his character magically developes into someone whose not quite as much of a pansy, but still a loser. Where have we seen this before? Oh, every other freakin' anime ever created! Kamina needed to learn to shut the hell up, everything he ever says is stupid and he constantly states the \"moral of the story\", which has always been a peeve of mine. This is worse than usual, as it's an excessively stupid moral like \"Don't believe in you who believes in yourself, believe in me who believes in you.\" Okay, it was funny the first 2.5 times, but after the 10th I wanted to shoot Kamina in the face, and that's not nearly the last time he says it before *SPOILERS!!!!11!1 like anyone gave a damn about this story* he dies *END SPOILERS!!!1!1!!*, and even after that, they continue to spew such a pathetic notion, making it painful to watch the show or care about any of said characters. Yoko has big, bouncy boobs and shoots a lot of stuff, that's about all.\nEnjoyment:\nNot very much. The story was bland, the characters were bland, the dialog was bland, the fights were bland, the art was bland, the sound was bland, everything was bland. There was no \"Epicness\" that I'd been promised so many times, just big robots. Big robots =/= epic.\nOverall, 3. Bad. Didn't like it. Unenjoyable.  Predictable. Uninteresting. Bland. Any other negative term you can possibly conjure. It was not good.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=103,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a fast paced, no-holds-barred Shounen, Sci-fi, Mecha, Adventure anime that takes many of the elements that worked well, to form something that is bursting with entertainment. ^_^\nThe story revolves around humanity&rsquo;s struggle against enemies known as the &ldquo;beastmen&rdquo; who use mecha to annihilate all the humans on the surface. The story is really simple, with no need for complications as it follows several people (including Simon, Kamina, Yoko, etc.) who stand up and fight. As the story goes, the people get stronger and their numbers grow larger and even after some major turning-points it never loses its focus. Nonetheless the\n          \n        story may be too simple for its own good. Yet this still doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that the anime is pure entertainment, having no dull moments but is always full of action and laughs. This somewhat changes after the time-skip though.\nThe characters are all pretty great themselves, with plenty of laughs to be had but it is the main ones that truly stand out. Simon who is the typical weak-minded boy found in a lot of shounen anime, Kamina the extreme, fanatical guy always moving forward towards his dream and Yoko the hot babe who is not only there for fanservice. These are the ones that develop the most throughout the story and in such interesting ways.\nThe animation quality may not be the best ever but it is perfect for this series. It embraces a rich colour palette with detailed background and environments. The characters and mecha have pretty basic but cool designs; with completely fluid movements, even during the comic book style action sequences. These over-the-top action sequences are what make the series so exciting with superbly implemented explosions, smoke and other special FX.\nThe music comprises of a mixture between sombre and thumping Rock, Rap and JPop beats and even though it gets fairly repetitive, the adrenaline will still be flowing whenever the action kicks in. The constant screaming and shouting can get annoying though.\nOverall this is a fast-paced anime series that will give young fans something to get excited over but also give of a classic anime feel for the somewhat mature viewer. What makes this mecha anime stand out from the rest is that is never gets too serious, so there&rsquo;s nothing in the way to ruin the enjoyment and mindless fun to be had. Of course for those who don&rsquo;t like mecha anime wouldn&rsquo;t suddenly like this one but if you don&rsquo;t have anything against giant robots then this series is a must (especially for FL CL and FMP! fans).\n^_^\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=94,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    When I hear about a company making a mecha anime, there are only two things that spring to mind: either they are brilliant, or they are goddamn blind and living under a rock. Thankfully for fans of anime worldwide, the boys and gals at Gainax are neither blind, nor living under a rock. The simple fact is that Gainax has proven one universal truth: no matter how saturated the genre may appear at any given time, there is always room for improvement. All you need is a robot with two heads, arguably the most elusive quality in a mecha.\nIn many ways, TTGL represents the true\n          \n        evolution of mecha. It takes the concept of armored fighting vehicle to a whole new level. A level no mecha anime dared to do before. \nNot once in TTGL did I feel like being let down. It is both visually and in terms of concept, a cross between Eureka Seven and Fooly Cool. Only, because of the nature of the genre itself, it's far less scripted. I was constantly being shocked in each episode, as it just keeps on getting better and better. The whole anime was frantic, brimming all kinds of nonsensical BS. But thats what separates TTGL from the rest of the mecha's. And it is the key of TTGL to winning the hearts of millions of people.\nThe story was enough for me to get hooked although it wasnt anything lavish. Ive always lean more on post-apocalyptic anime's since it has a tendency have an interesting story. There's even a major twist later on the series which is an excellent addition. In even went as far as, botching all logical sound judgment just to be able to explain what it has done.\n\n\nThe unusual thing about this show is the pace. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann had the advantage of not being based on manga, thus the speed of unfolding events was not constrained by manga releases. While Tengen Toppen Gurren Lagann certainly went through content faster than other animes usually do, it is actually quite reasonably paced. In truth I was quite pleased with the rate of progression throughout the series. It did not really feel too fast nor was it too slow. Despite the story being nothing unusual, it is very well done and well worth the watch, at least the first two thirds of it.\nThe characters here are also striking. They werent believable by any means, but they were certainly memorable. One in particular is Kamina, favored by the majority. I myself cannot deny this. With an optimistic, easy going personality, who wouldnt like Kamina? He and the strikingly bold style of this anime made what is today. Aside from him, a handful of characters go through a major development. We have Simon, a hopeless digger who is worse than dog **** acquires maturation. Rossiu, an annoying prick who becomes well... it wouldnt be fair if I give it away, now would it? There is even a minor romance here between the characters that increases the relationships between the characters. It was amazing how they were able to add drama in the middle of all the eccentric events.\nThe animation is top notch. It was able to change something so common in anime's into something deviating from the recognized that catches the eye of millions of people out there . The fan service here are also a plus, to most people at least. So if your not into 'bouncing', skip episode 6 and you'll be just fine.\nThe music was owing. The OP was lively enough for you to go to the top of your roof and scream your lungs out. It really made you prepare for what is to come, one hell of an awesome anime.  Even better, it was prevalent during climactic parts which really spices up the mood. The ED was also good. It had a nice mix of rap and metal.\nGranted, no anime is perfect, and neither is this one but as far as action anime's go, TTGL has done a stellar job. From guerrilla warfare to flinging cosmos as if its just mere softball, everywhere you look something over the top is happening.\nEvery second was intoxicating in TTGL. The comedy is also outrageously utterly ridiculous, you wont miss a laugh from it. But that doesnt mean TTGL cant be a tear jerker too, there are moments when there wont be a dry eye on the house.\nIn all, while no anime is perfect, Gainax should be praised if only for doing the unthinkable - by innovating the mecha genre. Of course, its effects go well beyond the sub-genre and advance the genre as a whole, which in itself has become a remarkably rare quality in the anime. Hats off to the Gainax boys. I may not be the biggest fan of mecha anime's, but this one just goes way beyond anyone's affinities towards mecha. Unless you hate being driven to shrill uncontrollably, Mecha fan or not, you will not regret watching this. You will rather regret for having read this review and have wasted all this time, not watching it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=51,   ["text"]="                          \n    SPOILER WARNING\nThis review will contain spoilers.\nSince the narrative and all in all the goals of the story differ so much before and after Episode 16, I'll be analyzing the 2 'parts' separately and then together.\nAnimation (applies to show as a whole) - I enjoyed the animation quite a bit. The changing styles to a more gritty pencil style at points, character designs were all unique, the fights were all well animated.\nSound (applies to the show as a whole) - The OP, ED's and OST were all good, especially the OP. Voice acting in both the Subbed and Dubbed were good as well.\nEpisodes 1-15\nTo be perfectly\n          \n        frank, I didn't enjoy these episodes much. If you enjoy watching mechas fight mechas with nothing else, then this is right up your alley. I for one, do not.\nStory - My main gripe with this part would have to be the predictability of the story. After the first 2 fights, I could tell it was just going to be them winning fights forever till they got to the spiral king. It got boring, and the only thing that kept me watching was the effect of Kamina's death, which I also figured, because of the blatant romantic foreshadowing with Yoko. \nCharacter development -  Pretty much limited to a small few, but it wasn't all that well done. The characters (other than maybe Simon and Nia), we're just blank slates, to advance the plot of defeating the spiral king. If you removed the purpose of defeating the Spiral King, what are they? Not much... Just a group of rowdy people, who can easily be described by a sentence, if not trope. Also, I really didn't get Yoko's purpose in the story. After she couldn't be a love interest, she was just a source of fanservice. \nWhile we're on the topic of fanservice, I know that most anime have it, but I think, firstly there was too much of it (eg beach episode (and the attempt on Nia just made me cringe)) and secondly, it completely ruins the (somewhat) serious tone of things. Yoko (I know, again) just shows up in a bikini shooting a sniper rifle, while people are dying and fighting for survival. I get thats somewhat her personality, but some of the shots (heh) just didn't blend. \nEpisode 16 was a recap of episode 1-15, which might actually be useful in how one might watch the show\nEpisodes 17-27 \nStory - This would be the reason to watch this show. This part incorporates many more themes into the show. Politics, Romance (a bit), Philosophy and Action (obviously). The 7 year timeskip was actually one of the best timeskips I've seen. It was to advance the plot of the story, and not to just get the writers out of a hole. The characters changed somewhat, which added to the realism. \nThe other themes explored in this part of the show, I quite enjoyed. The idea of using Simon as a scapegoat, and the problems of the transformation of society, the residents rioting, the value of lives, utilitarian or not?, the government under Rossiu. This was all interesting, and reminded me a lot of Code Geass. Nothing revolutionary, but still good nonetheless. \nThe deaths of some of the side characters, though sad, seemed really telegraphed and forced. I also dislike the fact that emotion can override everything, sure it makes for a heartwarming story, but for something that was made to contain humans (Ep 26), all of them being able to overcome it simply because they wanted to, just seemed like a cop-out to me. The ability for them to win just because they wanted to, and come out on top in the worst situations, just made this boring\nI did have a gripe with the action. Again, it was predictable. Since we now know that spiral power is strengthened by emotion, Simon never loses. He just doesn't. The show fails at creating suspense, which is one of the main goals of action.\nGiant robots? Don't worry. Its Simon\nThe moon is falling onto us? Don't worry. Its Simon.\nFighting an entire dimension of enemies? Don't worry. Its Simon.\nWhats the point in watching (sure the animation is nice), but its not engaging, its not thought provoking, you're not emotionally involved.\nCharacter Development - I didn't really see the point to Yoko's side story either. It could be looked at as simply filler, or a desperate attempt at development onto a character that hadn't got much of any before. We had some average character development in this part, especially Rossiu. Otherwise characters were sub-par.\nOverall Thoughts\nThe show overall, was somewhat bland, around around 4/10. \nThe idea for TTGL was a good one, but it wasn't executed well. If you have a good story with bad characters, its still a bad story (While a bad story with good characters can be good). The characters are only there to advance the plot.\nIf I was going to recommend this to someone, I'd almost recommend skipping he first 15 episodes, because the second half is more interesting, and you have a recap anyways.\n        "},

Ladies and gentlemen that series is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, do not let the lengthy name intimidate you or the seemingly cartoonish style put you off  because this show is worth it and you'd sorely regret not experiencing this gem of a series. In a world where the majority considers mediocre shows such as Naruto to be masterpieces, we often overlook shows that so sorely deserve our attention and they end up just passing us by. I'm writing this review in hopes it will divert\n          \n        your attention away from shouting bankai as you imitate Ichigo and open your eyes to this series.\nStory wise Gurren Lagann shows us exactly what an anime should be, a seemingly simple story of a young men forced to stay in a world against their will delves into gripping story of man vs fate, man vs man, and man vs self. The story itself doesn't drag on and on for episodes on end trying to solve what could be done in one it is, in short, paced perfectly. Also it is impossible to be lost or confused in this series as you are constantly given just enough information to understand what is going on but it holds back enough to keep you interested.\nThe art is easy on the eyes though it does have a choppy feel at times it isn't so bad that you can't make out what is going on. Chalk it up to production expenses, since there are a lot of action scenes. \nThe musical score was obviously well thought out, it matches the mood of the scene and doesn't interfere with the story at all it remains where it should be...the backround. It also incorporates many genres as well it's a mix of hip hop, contemporary, rock, even opera so you should find a few pieces that are similar to your taste in music.\nThe characters are done extremely well, they are developed nicely and convey emotions quite well, you can literally feel their plight. Also their emotional depth doesn't consist of a bad childhood, and crying when the world doesn't bend to their will. The are a wide range of characters, and as well so you're bound to find one that interests you . A word of warning, this isn't a cutesy series where all semi important characters are protected by an anti-death shield so don't expect your favorite characters to have happy endings.\nThe enjoyment factor should be apparent in the way I've written so far, just in case you are slow this is an extremely enjoyable show, it has quite a bit of slapstick as well as non-slapstick comedy. The battle scenes are intense and fast paced be they in mecha or hand to hand.\nOverall this is a series that you shouldn't let pass you by, so please if only for a second turn away from Naruto and Bleach (take a deep breath buddy, they'll be there when you turn back) and give Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann a chance you won't regret it.\n        "},

Don't expect many intellectually mind-blowing events or characters, if any. This anime is zany, wacky, fun, and almost nothing more.\nI want to be clear: I enjoyed this series, but I can acknowledge that it really isn't anything special.\nThe emotional impact of the show is pretty much summed up in the 'Ganbarre yo!' effect I mentioned earlier. It's all about doing your best and fighting no matter how bad the situation gets. \nIf you like a series where things are zany, over-the-top, and crazy, you might like Gurren Lagann. \nIf you like a series where the characters win by force of will alone, you might like Gurren Lagann.\nFinally, if you like a light-hearted series that you can sit down and watch without the emotional turmoil of some other series (read: Code Geass), you might like Gurren Lagann. \nWatch the first 4 or 5 episodes.

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=68,   ["text"]="\nThe thing about having high expectations is that you do your best to enjoy the show even before you press play. And once you’ve finished watching, you either feel satisfied that this series truly lived up to the hype and something you too would recommend to others or, more than often, you wind up sitting down, watching the credits roll and wondering why you were looking forward to this wishy-washy stuff in the first place.\nIn 2007, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann pierced its drill not just into the heavens, but also into the hearts of millions of fans across the globe. It is  probably one\n          \n        of the most massively raved shows with fans believing the series was a gift from the mecha Gods themselves and critics lavishing praise to the point of reducing the scores of its counterparts just because they didn’t stand up to what was thought to be Gainax’s magnum opus. \nAll build-up and fandom aside, the critical question must be answered: “Does Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann deliver?” \nTo an extent, it does. But this is by no means masterpiece material.\nAs you might’ve noticed from the score and the introduction, I am not a fanboy of this show. If you are, then please hold your horses and try not to burst a vein, because everyone is entitled to an opinion and I’m doing my best to justify mine here. Your patience is appreciated, thank you.\nIn the world of TTGL, humans live in underground cities and must dig to expand and survive. In the tiny village of Jiha, Simon, a young and skilled driller, teams up with Kamina, a hot blooded punk, to break out of their cage. After stumbling upon a mecha head and running into a voluptuous teen named Yoko, the trio manages to break out of their hell hole and reach the surface, where danger and destiny awaits.\nThere are two ways one can look at TTGL:\n1.	As a homage/tribute to the old school mecha anime. (If you’re a fan of the genre.) \n2.	As a standalone series. (If your knowledge of mecha anime is little to none.)\nIn the first case, the show is said to be parody/tribute to fans of the genre defining anime of the 20th century – the Super Robot era.  I’m referring to the time when the word ‘anime’ was almost synonymous with mecha shows such as Gundam, Neon Genesis Evangelion and Macross. This was the period when anime gained its most fervent otaku, who believe this to be the Golden Age of anime. TTGL captures the key elements of these anime and crams it all into a single 27 episode series. Although you may be thinking that the handling might come out as kind of rough and rushed because of the sheer ground that needs to be covered, it does not. The execution is seamless and manages to port every one of those memorable scenarios, which are today clichés because of their success then. It’s a lot of fun for those who closely followed those classics, because TTGL is a wonderful tribute and is sure to get you to join the “Bring back the GAR!” gang. It’s a lot like the warm and nostalgic feeling of watching Star Wars reruns on TV. So, assuming you’re one of those “Old is gold” and “Screw the moe, bring the GAR” people, then you’re sure to find TTGL to be one of the most engrossing stories you’ve ever watched. The pure manliness of it all will win a place in your heart.\nNow, let’s consider TTGL as a standalone anime and not as a “homage series”. When I watched TTGL, I had no idea that it was a parody/tribute. It was only later when one of my friends told me that it was did I even start thinking from that perspective. The reason for that is probably because I don’t watch a lot of mecha anime and had no idea that most of the scenes were references to the beloved 90s shows. Therefore, not knowing that the clichés were intentional, I found the plot to be a total and complete letdown. It is downright predictable and there were only a handful of moments when I sat up and said “Whoa, I did not see that coming”. The story progresses in the usual style of beating mini bosses until you find out that the main boss was actually a mini boss to another main boss and so on. Trademark, textbook stuff, this one. Take a kid, sit him on a mecha, hand him a shonen script and your TTGL storyline is good to go. If this is your first mecha anime, skip this one at all costs. Nothing surprising, shocking or even mildly original.\nOne other thing that must be known about TTGL is that it is split into two arcs, the second arc beginning just after the halfway mark of the series. The second arc occurs after a time skip of 7 years and this makes it seem like almost a second season. There is a complete overhaul of the TTGL mechanism and there are drastic changes to the point that it is hardly recognizable with the anime you watched a couple of episodes ago.\nThe first arc was about Simon manning up and facing the wrath of the Beastmen Empire. The tale is the usual “boy grows a pair” one, which is shockingly (and intentionally) similar to that of Shinji of Evangelion. While fighting off hordes of mecha (referred to as Ganmen in the show), he also bonds with Kamina and the rest of the cast, slowly paving the way to adulthood. The story moves pretty fast paced here and testosterone charged action is aplenty. While nowhere close to adrenaline pumping, it does retain your attention from start to finish. \nAnd then there’s the second arc. Here, the show transforms into something completely different. Many hated it, but I personally preferred the second arc to the first. In fact, if you’re one of those guys who doesn’t have a very large attention span and found the first few episodes of TTGL to be disappointing, then I recommend you watch episode 15, which is a recap episode, and move on to the rest of the series. The second arc is more about the people and less about the mecha. It throws in dashes of politics and psychology. It is still fast paced, but doesn’t quite feel like it because of the sudden lack of explosions, missiles and screaming shonen kids. Things finally get a tad emotional. But don’t let that delude you into thinking that TTGL becomes a more mature show. Hell, no. \nWhich perfectly poises me to break down one of the show’s biggest downfalls (or biggest selling point, depending upon your perspective): Wackiness. What starts out as mere lack of logic soon turns into sheer idiocy. There is only so much nonsensical content one can take. There are moments in this show when you feel like banging your head against the screen because of the fact that even suspending your disbelief cannot eradicate the magnitude of insanity. Ripping dimensions apart to travel faster, using galaxies as bullets, mashing them together to make a bigger bullet, claiming planets to be mechas, it’s all here. But then again, when you can have a bot that relies on emotions as a fuel, what is to be expected other than chaos?\nThe shows TTGL borrows from actually had field tactics, strategies, pilot psychology and other intellectual plot twists. But TTGL itself has nothing of that sort, which is a total misfit if it’s supposed to be a series that should bring memories of the classics.\nAll criticism aside, I finally land on the thing that impressed me most about TTGL – the animation. It’s fresh, funky and fun. Bold and bright colors are thrown around to make the episodes vibrant with life. There is an overall punk-style. The font of the episode name and the mid-screen change, depending upon the character in focus, and it all shows that the artists put some heart and soul into it. The Ganmen look varied enough and there’s hardly any room for confusion even though there are tons of them. My opinion here might be a bit biased since I watched this on Blu-ray, but I’m still not denying the animation department a ten on ten.\nThe soundtrack was on target too. The OP was bad and the EDs, except for Love and Rock Peace, were painful to hear as well. But, there is one track that stands out as one of the most memorable pieces of anime music I’ve heard in a while. Yes, I am of course referring to the rappera (rap + opera) song, Fight the Powah! This one track carries the weight of the ending on its shoulders and is played around 4 times in the last 3 episodes. In fact, here’s a message to the people who’ve watched TTGL and ran around the forums screaming on how epic the ending was: Try to blank out the soundtrack playing in the background and just focus on the video and the voices. You’ll notice how terribly stupid it sounds. Good music makes for a good atmosphere.\nThe characters are, in all honesty, terrible. They are paper cut-outs from the “How to Make Shonen Characters” book. Some of the side characters (Viral, Rossiu, Kittan) were easily more eye-catching than the main cast.\nSimon is a meek attempt at Shinji Ikari of Neon Genesis Evangelion. He is the usual bloke who throws a tantrum when he doesn’t get what he wants and shouting like a little girl who was bit by a rabid dog seems to solve all the world’s problems. He is totally boring and even the slight addition of layers to his character in the second half aren’t enough to make him an interesting character. Sad stuff, really. I really was expecting more from a character who appears on almost every episode of the series. However, his second arc changes are what made me boost his scores up a bit. \nKamina is the hot blooded shonen teen punk, the optimistic happy-go-lucky git. Not too much to say about him because he doesn’t get as much air time as Simon, for reasons you’ve got to watch to know. But Kamina is definitely an embodiment of badass leadership and the sort of hero every nerd wants to be, and you can’t really blame them.  \n Yoko, the wet dream frequenter of thousands of otaku, is actually a pretty complex character. Sadly, she doesn’t live upto her potential because of her poor treatment by the scriptwriters. What could’ve been a fantastic female lead is turned into a jiggle-bimbo with a gun. There is one other female character that deserves a mention. This character was a complete and shameless Ctrl+C – Ctrl+V of Euphemia from Code Geass. Faanboys are bound to blame that on the “tribute factor” too.\nThe enjoyment factor…probably the hardest place for me to rate TTGL on. Why? Because its stupidity was actually entertaining at times. Hearing “Who the hell do you think we are?!” right at the finish of an epic battle sequence, feels, well, epic. Uber-manliness. There were times when I pumped my fist in the air and gave a “Hell, yeah!” to Simon and his gang. But there were also times when I used that same fist to smash the screen because of the WTFness. I just couldn’t handle the clichés under the pretext of homage during the first arc. Once again, your enjoyment will depend on whether you look at TTGL as a tribute or a standalone, the former triumphing over the latter.\nOverall, TTGL is the kind of anime which you’re going to enjoy depending upon your love for the genre. If you love mecha anime, then this one is sure to give you a bang for your buck. If not, then your experience might be underwhelming. \n[ THE WRAP-UP ]\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the sort of anime that ends up being disappointing mainly because of a reputation that precedes it. It’s a matter of whether you look at TTGL to be a mark of respect for the mecha anime over the years or whether you consider it to be a completely detached series. If it is a case of the former with you, then TTGL will be one of the most epic anime to ever hit the screen, but it will be the exact opposite if your opinion is of the latter. It is a giant banner for the “Bring back the GAR!” movement. The story is split into two very different arcs, of which you will love one and hate the other, based on your personal tastes. The animation has a funky punk style and is one of the most richly drawn anime I have ever seen. It is evident that Gainax did not spare any expense in the audio department as well, because the soundtrack is almost as stunning. The characters are a massive let down and do no justice to their massive fandom. My advice is to watch the first five episodes and if you don’t like it, then just watch the recap episode on 15 and move on to the second arc. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is one of those anime I liked, but never enjoyed.\nLove and rock. Peace.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=61,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    “Pierce the heavens, Gurren Lagann!”\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is one of the most watched, most rated, most talked about anime series on MAL. Have you ever considered whether you should give this show a try? Just why do people keep calling it “epicness”? If you are curious enough to look up this show but is undecided (or unsure) if it will turn out being a complete waste of time for you, then look no further! You have found the missing piece to your puzzle.\nImagine. Life in underground caves where the sky is blocked off by thick layers of dirt, where no trees can ever grow,\n          \n        where no wind can ever blow. Imagine. Life as a digger whose sole purpose is to endlessly dig and drill as there is nothing better to do. To top it off, let us further imagine that life are constantly under threat by an unknown source of earthquake from above. This hell hole is precisely where the story begins.\nOur teenage protagonist, Simon the digger as he calls himself, has absolutely zero talent of being a hero-type guy to begin with. In fact, he was more likely to be viewed as a loser. His eventual success of being “the man who saves the universe”, in part, is thanks to his best friend whom he often regards as his older brother known as Kamina (*and no my name was not derived from him*). Brother Kamina, along with a cute long hair sniper girl called Yoko helped transform the loser Simon into a “GAR” Simon.\nWhile the story, to a large extend, focus on the character growth of Simon and how he cope with various issues in life, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the story itself is very plot driven. This is especially true in the latter half where viewers will notice an onion peel effect in the battles. One can find a story buried within another story, yet buried still within another story. There may also be people out there who will tell you the story can be basically split into two parts. Where the first part totally owns in terms of character growth and overall sanity of the show and the latter just totally transform the plot into something not recognizable but any sane person. Guess what? They have a point.\nAlthough the battles in the first half of the story pales compare to the latter part (as far as actions are concerned), at the very least there was a sensible goal and sensible way to deal with the problem. However, the second half literally takes things to the edge of the universe. Hardcore action fans will most certainly scream with joy seeing the most unbelievable action in their lifetime, but to the everyday norm like the rest of us, it may seem a little unexpected (some extremists called it unacceptable for ruining all the hard work built up from the first half). Anyhow, at least it was a nice change from the predictable monster of the week cliché.\nThe soundtracks, by and large, are extremely well made. A few particular BGM played during the key moments of the story just make things all the better. Both the OP and various ED fit nicely with their corresponding animation counterpart. The seiyu have done a wonderful job as well, acting out their roles with great passion and pride. Surprisingly, a few seiyu used such a unique voice that most people (even fans) don’t even recognize them (see if you can identify their voices without spoiling yourself).\nCertainly TTGL is not just another one of your average anime. With intense battle scenes, a decent amount of character developments, and creative plot (note that I acknowledge its creativity and originality, but I am not necessary saying the plot make sense nor reasonable … that my friend, will be decided by you once you have watched the series) it will deliver beyond your expectation. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=54,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Born deep in the dirt, surrounded and made captive by earth above and below, where can a person go from there?  There are three options: you do nothing and lay there until you die, you dig lower and strive to find yourself in the filth and darkness and loneliness, or you cast it all aside and reach for the sky you know exists.  Certainly, the latter is the most difficult path to choose and it's not likely to just fall into your lap—but let's say it does just that, in the form of a device that will empower your very desire to explode\n          \n        forth into the world.\nIn this case, a boy named Simon—Simon the Digger to most—finds a small key that resembles the drill he uses to explore his surroundings in search of treasure.  Little does he know at first that he has just found a treasure that will grant him control of a mecha that will respond to his emotions.  And before long, when the huge and scary world above comes crashing down into the tiny world he knows, he'll discover what he can do with this machine thanks to the encouragement of his big bro, the fiercely optimistic Kamina.  One battle leads to a sort of tumbling-up-the-rabbit-hole, where the vast sky wheels around them and there's no limit to be seen—no dirt ceiling hanging above, just the endless blue horizon.\nBy the second episode, Simon and Kamina have met Yoko and her band of rebels up on the surface.  Where do they go from there?  They soon learn that the surface world is a scary place, and the old cave from which they emerged begins to seem like a refuge, the place of their childhood—an earthly womb, perhaps.  Up here, the beastmen piloting mecha with giant faces called Ganmen seek to exterminate humans, and along with this group of scrappers Simon and Kamina find themselves engaging in a succession of battles, awkwardly beginning to realize what they're capable of doing.  Kamina, especially, throws himself into the mix with a boldness that sets the tone for the series.  \"Who the hell do you think I am?!\" he shouts, demonstrating that in this world, where there's a will there's a way.  And as the forces of oppression loom ever larger, the Gurren Brigade gains more and more resolve.\nLike many coming-of-age stories, TTGL has its phase of male adolescence.  A time-leap brings us to an era when our heroes, once grasping for the skies, have lost their way.  They struggle to face their new freedom and responsibility, and suddenly they are not very likable.  In fact, you'll probably want to punch most of them.  Simon especially, as he struggles to become even half the man that Kamina proved to be early in the series, let alone a man of his own strengths and desires.  He may as well be back in the cave he came from, gathering dust in angsty stagnation.  It's only fitting that Yoko and the other women at the core of the cast have found their place in the world apart from the rest, accepting their adulthood in stride.  And it is only a new threat of loss and oppression that provides the man-children the kick in the ass necessary to get them moving again.  And move they do.  Purpose is rediscovered.  Maybe the scared and thoughtful boy that Simon was can find himself after all, even if he does follow in Kamina's footsteps.  There are far worse things one could aspire to.\nQuick comments on the quality of animation and sound here: excellent.  Aside from the occasional misstep (such as the notoriously ugly fourth episode), everything here looks great, emphasizing the wild boldness of the story with animation that threatens to disintegrate into pure color and energy under such force.  The soundtrack is thunderous, full of upbeat pop-rock and bombastic classical or neoclassical pieces that suit the increasingly epic feel perfectly.\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann could be considered Gainax's magnum opus—the contrarily nihilistic Neon Genesis Evangelion notwithstanding.  What they've managed to do with this show is take traditions set forth by Gunbuster/Top wo Nerae! and its sequel, Diebuster/Top wo Nerae! 2 and blend them with more subtle elements of the very non-traditional postmodernist FLCL.  Rather than having robots popping out of the young protagonist's head after being clocked by a girl with an electric guitar, the boy goes about his usual mode of working his way through life and discovers the key to a robot that responds to his emotions, his very spirit, opening the way up and out, eradicating limitations as long as he can muster the desire to change, grow, and realize his destiny.  Look to your dreams and reach for the heavens: every light in the sky is a star.  It's a premise that is just as absurd, yet it seems to make sense compared to all the pubescent confusion FLCL hurls at its audience.  This drill is the boy's soul—the key to a boundless extension of himself that he will call Gurren Lagann.  \"This drill is me.\"  The \"hard work and guts!\" of Gunbuster becomes, \"My drill is the drill that will penetrate the heavens!\"  Aim for the top, indeed.\n        "},

Just simply put this is a masterpiece of animated storytelling. Everyone, regardless of whether or not they're an anime fan, owes it to themselves to see Gurren Lagann before they die.\nStory: 10 (Outstanding)\nThe story is deceptively simple yet simply hits all the right notes where it needs to. Kamina and Simon are diggers living in an underground village. Their job is to dig - digging is the lifeblood of the village, it's what allows the village to expand and grow in population.\n          \n        But it's not the kind of life Kamina wants. Kamina wants to kick logic to the curb and drill through the heavens, just like his long-believed to be dead dad who, as the rumors go, actually makes it to the surface. The desire to drill to the surface is Kamina's one great ambition in life, an ambition that earns him the ire of the rest of the village, and he frequently has to be tempered by his adoptive brother Simon. \nThen one day, Simon stumbles upon a strange, drill-like object buried underneath the dirt. He races over to show Kamina, who tells him that the strange object rightly belongs to Simon and shall forever belong to him. Soon afterwards, Simon stumbles upon an even stranger object - it looks like a giant head! Once again he races to tell Kamina, but before he can show him a giant mechanical beast crashes through the heavens and onto the village, along with the beautiful 'surface girl' Yoko.\nAnd all of this and more happens in just the first episode!\nThe plot evolves quickly and is very fast pace, and soon an expanding team headed by Kamina, Simon, Yoko and a field of friends and former enemies soon find themselves staring down what may very well be the complete annihilation of the entire universe!\nArt: 10 (Outstanding)\nThe art is just terrific, and does much to carry on the incredible fast pace of the series. Simple when it needs to be, detailed when it needs to be, the featureless plains of a desert earth contrasts with a vast, detailed and colorful sky to bring the viewer into the desolate world these characters reside in. The character designs themselves may very well go down in history as some of the best remembered and most celebrated, at times looking more like an animated superhero comic book than a shonen anime. The mecha is fantastic too - very distinct with the main body of most mecha being dominated by a face (indeed, halfway through the anime everything, and I mean everything the humans and beastmen build seems to have a face for unexplained reasons, which only adds to the charm) and the Gurren Lagann itself will probably go down as an icon of mecha alongside EVA-01, Ray Armuro's Gundam and the VFS-1 Valkyrie.\nSound: 10 (Outstanding)\n...is perhaps the least that can be said about the sound of Gurren Lagann. The OST is probably filled to the brim with the most memorable music in all of humanity's existence, from the OP Sora ino Days to all three EDs (including Happy Endings, which accompanied only a single episode, the appropriate and unusually well done compilation episode). Perhaps the most legendary of them all is Libra Me aka ROW ROW FIGHT DA POWAH!, which is now known far and wide to even those who have never heard of Gurren Lagann thanks to its memetic power.\nCharacter: 10 (Outstanding)\nThe characters of Gurren Lagann are an interesting lot - some are memorable because of their singular motivations and two-dimensions, such as Kamina and his sole ambition to be the best living specimen he can possibly be, a notion so strong it cannot help but infect everyone around him and even his enemies. Other characters are actually very well mapped out and surprisingly deep, such as Simon, who is conflicted by his own insecurities and his aspirations to be just like Kamina. Even Boota, Simon's mute pet pigmole, gets a lot of character development, especially in regards to an incredible, jaw-dropping twist near the end. The bad guys show up as amazing characters as well, especially Viral, who surprisingly only tries to do what he believes is good and useful, and Lord Genome, whose character development turns out to be one of the many developing twists in the series.\nEnjoyment: 10 (Outstanding)\nAs you may have already gathered by now, there is nothing not to like in Gurren Lagann even for those who hate mecha anime. Nary a single second is boring, and the action and story is a non-stop whirlwind. \nWith all that said, it comes as no surprise that Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann gets a final score of:\n10 - Outstanding\nReally, nothing more needs to be said.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=52,   ["text"]="                          \n    This is the only series that is bad enough for me to put it on hold thrice but just good enough for me to pick up again and finish. I am astounded by the mass popularity of this anime, there is no logical reason for it. The story you can say is about fulfilling dreams, which is fine. The problem is that it tries to be serious and absurd at the same time. Combining FLCL and Gundams does not work, yet that is exactly what this anime is. The animation is very good however and and their use of CGI fit in nicely when they\n          \n        used it. The musical score is nothing to brag about, it was neither a + or - for the show it was just there. The development of Simon may be the shows one redeeming quality. With the exception of a few incredibly bland characters like Kamina, most were fairly unique and a few core characters grew quite a bit. Overall it is hard to take this series seriously when you have giant drills coming out of nowhere, mechs with faces(for no explainable reason) and talk of 'spirals'. If your just coming out of the DBZ watching anime faze then yes this will seem like a work of art to you. If not, then its nothing special and watch it if you find the time after watching better anime.\n        "},

Gurren Lagann seems to do the same thing, as in copying the over-the-top style and cheesy writing from the mecha anime from those days. Or they made a parody on that exact same thing by going even further into it then they did back in the 70s.\nI'll admit straight away that this type of anime is\n          \n        not my style, especially since I'm someone that loves an anime with a great story, which is something that seems to be put into this anime as an afterthought to fill in the few seconds in between the senseless battles and fanservice.\nI'll give a rundown of the scores, as I usually do.\nStory: 2\nThere is something of a story put into this anime, but it's far from original, full of plot holes and succeeding in making as little sense as possible. The story is mainly used to drive the main characters from fight A to fight B while occasionally stopping for some fanservice. It's definitely not used to explain the events of the story, and when they try to do that it fails miserably and leaves holes in the plot large enough to fly a spaceship through.\nArt: 6\nIt's decent to look at, although it does have quite a few repeated scenes (some even to the point of being nauseating) that are shown and reshown in several episodes. I also felt that the inclusion of \"manga\" style images broke the flow.\nHowever even if the art was decent to look at the amount of cheesiness that it threw at the screen was so far over-the-top that it made me want to go and do something else that didn't include have to watch this anime, even Dragonball GT seems to be preferable over this at times...\nThe style of the art seems modern but the way in which it's used is fit for an anime from 30 years ago.\nSound: 6\nIt's decent, but like the art and the story very cheesy. The screaming out of a character's name during a death scene is SO overused, done to death and over the top that it really should become punishable by death to use it.\nCharacters: 2\nWhat can I say... They are shallow, have very little character development, many seem to be included for the sole purpose of fanservice or comic relief and the amount of cliché character traits is as over-the-top as the rest of the anime.\nWe've got the whiny spineless emo teenager, the \"I'm so cool that I'm gonna die halfway though the series\" guy, the bigbreasted airhead, the faceless nameless enemy that's as 2 dimensional as can be, and so forth, and so forth.\nThe character design and character development are practically the worst I've ever seen.\nEnjoyment: 4\nYeah, it was a load of fun action topped off with fanservice, atleast if you don't mind an almost complete lack of a coherent story and got plenty of crackers to scoop up the cheese with.\nOverall: 5\nIt's a bit of fun, looks nice, sounds kinda nice but trips over it's own plot holes.\n2 dimensional stock characters with hardly any development going on and a shaky over-the-top lack of a storyline.\nIn my opinion mediocre at best, which is something that Gainax seems to be specializing in lately.\nIf you didn't think my review was helpful, please leave a message on my profile and explain why you thought my review wasn't helpful. That way I can improve my reviews to make them better in the future.\nThank you in advance.\n        "},

We cheer for them and give them recognition when we need them but just as easily forget and toss them aside when they've done their part. Heroes live short lives. They often go unrecognized, aren't given monetary gain, or any type of value to enrich their lives for their heroic feats. They rarely ask for anything in return. They humbly sacrifice their dreams and happiness so that the rest of us can enjoy ours;\n          \n        that's what makes them heroes. \nI believe the best description of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is calling it an epic. No, I don’t mean the overused term, ‘epic’, in which people use to describe various things they deem simply cool. I’m talking about the word epic that stems from Greek literature; a journey that focuses on a hero overcoming all odds through success and failure. Gurren Lagann is truly a spectacle that every anime watcher should see at some point during their anime watching career. While Gurren Laggan isn't perfect, can we really say that anything is really perfect? It has its own deficiencies and hiccups that hold it back from achieving a more perfect state, yet still elevates its good points masterfully. \nThe story isn't exceptionally thought invoking or full of intellectual plot twists that stimulate the brain. If you're using your brain, you've chosen the incorrect organ of choice. What Gurren Lagann lacks in logical prowess it makes up for in heart. It's uplifting and depressing, exhilarating and discouraging, and fascinating yet illogical. The story of Gurren Lagann is one in which a young man tosses away the shackles of oppression and forges his own destiny to pierce heaven itself. With the exception of a couple episodes of what I consider filler, I loved every moment of Gurren Lagann. It was exciting, fresh, and accelerated past my brain, drilling it's place into my heart. \nThe art/animation of TTGL is a bit of a mixture of good and bad. While there are dips in the animation and consistency, it still swings back to its natural, explosive greatness when we need it to; it immensely satisfies when satisfaction is expected. The style of TTGL is unmistakably over the top and excessive when it comes to fights, explosions, and kicking all concepts of physics and logic to the curb, but that's also part of its appeal. \nGurren Lagann's soundtrack was by no means fantastic or anything of the like, but somehow everything fits together and creates such an enjoyable experience that it doesn't really matter. Fuck logic, think with raw emotion. As anyone else who has seen the show will tell you, Libera Me From Hell will probably be imprinted into your soul as it's the song grows on you during battles, speeches, and moments of greatness during the last few episodes. It complements TTGL extremely well and is the defining piece of the series. I think the OST in general was good as well; it felt inspirational and helped fuel the already exploding levels of testosterone in the audience. \nCharacters is where Gurren Lagann has the most success. The Dai-Gurren Gang/Dai-Gurren Brigade are all easily likeable and mesh so well that near impossible not to enjoy their presence on screen. Simon is the main character of the series and for the most part almost everything is dedicated to his growth as a character, though inspired by his role model and big brother figure, Kamina. The most admirable trait about Simon is that he remains such a humble figure from start to finish. Despite the power, glory, and hardships along the way, Simon stays true to himself. One thing that I would have liked was a little more development of the supporting cast. Some characters seem to lose their importance later in the series which is saddening to watch. Yoko, the original main female lead is subjected to this. All in all, I loved the characters of TTGL as a whole. They were the heart and soul of the series and they made such an amazing show possible. \nThe last thing I would like to talk about is the ending. Personally I think Gurren Lagann had one of the best endings in anime of all time. It depicts the struggles of what it means to have great power and the sacrifices you must make in being the hero. Tacking on such a powerful ending to top off a grand journey of surpassing dreams, tossing away logic, and overcoming the most unlikely of odds adds such a bittersweet feeling and concludes a fine chapter in the ever so growing collection of anime. Upon finishing the series for the second time, I am once again filled with angst and a feeling of depression just like my first. It's not because the series was at all disappointing. It's because I realize I probably won't feel the same charged emotions, shed the same manly tears, and raise my finger in the air pointing to the heavens ever again.\nAbayo, Dachikō. I bid you adieu. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=46,   ["text"]="                          \n    I am not a mecha person.  I started watching TTGL to check out what the hype's all about.  It turned out to be overrated. \nNow, before you bitch at me for saying that, hear me out...\nAnimation: Although the series was enjoyable, I didn't understand a thing during the fight scenes.  All I could remember are lines barging in and out, no image in particular stuck out.  Thank goodness for non-action scenes, I get to enjoy absurd drawings of creatures I never though of possible.  But because of its unique aspect, I gave it a 6.\nStory:  One of the good\n          \n        things of this series is the concept.  Although the plot was simple, the concept behind it is admirable.  I am a biologist so I understood well why the spiral possess so much power. \nMusic:  One word to describe it, 'COOL.'  \nCharacter:  Also one of the good things about this series.  It showed a good light on stubborness.  It simply says 'Being stubborn gives you power to succeed.'\nEnjoyment:  The first half did not really struck me.  I merely continued watching to know the story.  It was in the second half that things started to get exciting.\nOverall:  This series requires the audience to have a wide perspective on things to make it enjoyable.  I asked someone from MAL what was so great about this series because I hardly found it enjoyable at first, now, I believe what made it to the top rank is pure character.  All of the categories, story, art, sound and character has an elemental character imbued to it.  The animation has a personal character distinct to TTGL, along with the music which was way cool and the concept of the story which was extraordinary.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=19,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Courage is a strong feeling. It's what forms success in the face of danger, and combined with ambition can even change the world. We've all daydreamed at some point in our lives about being someone who could change the world, visualizing the sanctity of that type of success. It may have appeared luminous and almost lucid in your mind, further cementing the unreachable truth of it all. Although many of us will never come close to this dream, cinema and entertainment exist to put our \"underdog\" stories on display and create a sense of relevance in our imagination. The unrealistic aspect of the whole thing\n          \n        is what makes it so enjoyable in anime like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. A kid and his brother rise from the dirt (literally), armed with a commandeered mech and determination. The ensuing story is bombastic and inspiring, and unlike our lives, leaves nothing to the imagination.\nThis may sound rather selfish, but I feel Gurren Lagann is a culmination of every crazy, fictional idea I ever had. A \"rags to riches\" protagonist, giant robots, talking beasts and hot chicks with gigantic guns doesn't even scratch the surface. This anime embodies ridiculous, and makes the most exaggerated and outlandish ideas matter of fact, while exploring every imaginable anime cliche. Although mostly careless and whimsical, the writing also covers very serious subjects such as death, politics and isolationism. It's both an allegory and a loose parody, depending on which point of the series you're looking at. As over-the-top as Gurren Lagann is, it does so without becoming pretentious or annoying, allowing most viewers to enjoy its eccentric sense of style.\nThe atmosphere of the series feels like one giant crescendo (kudos to my fellow music lovers who got that reference). Kamina and Simon's relevance to the world near the beginning feels virtually insignificant, but their potential is enormous once they emerge from the depths of their quarantine. Battles escalate from trivial to world-changing over the course of the series, and the confidence of the cast responds accordingly. Just when I thought it couldn't outdo itself in terms of outrageousness, the writers pulled even more out of their asses. The beauty of Gurren Lagann's satirical nature is that it pulls no punches. Instead of wasting time droning on with the science behind the mech's functionality, they bombard you with a flashy cut scene that you come to accept as truth within a few episodes. People who go into the show expecting something serious are missing the entire point. Gurren Lagann is one giant cliché, and I absolutely love it.\nOver the years, people seem to be conflicted over the series in general. At some points throughout the second half, the mech combinations and \"galaxy throwing\" can start to get beyond absurd... Some might even begin to call it corny. Again, this is shying away from the satire rooted in Gurren Lagann's development. The art is often criticized for being lazy or inconsistent. Again, I refer you to my previous statement. The characters mostly exist as tropes or cardboard cutouts of similar characters from other shows shouting repetitive catchphrases every time they appear on screen. A-gain, more of the parody that is Gurren Lagann. The writers admitted to be writing the series as they went, and never originally had plans for a second half of the season.\nPerhaps the most valid argument I can agree with regarding the series is that it never really teaches you anything. Rarely are the downsides explored (with the exception of the obvious major death), and it falsely advertises that you can overcome any obstacle by exuding brute force. Unlike some series (Hunter x Hunter etc.) where the main characters are notoriously beaten and battered, causing them to train even harder, Gurren Lagann lives by a \"antagonists don't matter\" policy. Within minutes after piloting their first Gunmen, Simon and Kamina are already more powerful than about four or five other entities on the planet. And Simon's reaction to the idea of losing his next loved one in arc #2? Lose her while looking badass as fuck and throwing galaxies like they're baseballs. Simon as a character initially seemed promising but became unidentifiable in the second half, leading me to realize that sometimes the best character is the one you least identify with... Which for me had to be Rossiu. I thought he became a raging prick in the second half, but he arguably receives better development than Simon based on his past, and he sure as hell acts more responsible. Just prior to the credits rolling, we see Simon take the cop-out approach and damn himself to wander the rest of eternity as a vagrant. Sigh, oh well.\nDespite the naysayers, Gurren Lagann seems to care less about its flaws, and I can respect that. After all, it really only needed to accomplish one thing: ENTERTAINMENT. From an enjoyment perspective, the series earns full marks. I was nostalgic, giddy and bubbling with excitement during the action sequences. The animation was unlike anything I'd seen before, completely distorting my perception of what a mech-style anime was \"supposed\" to be. I get that some Gundam or Macross fanatics may be critical of the gunmen's designs, but all I have to say is \"it's not Gundam or Macross, it's a PAR-O-DY.\" On top of the flashy space battles, the environments were drawn nicely and the character models were distinguishable and eclectic. Not to mention the necessary fan service depiction of Yoko Littner... I mean she did live in the desert, right?\nThe music is nothing short of spectacular in Gurren Lagann. Fast pace drums and face-melting riffs echoed through my brain during some of the action sequences. And that OP is superb. Be sure to check out the extended version on YouTube if you have the chance. Contrary to most anime, the English voice acting is also superb. Most notably is Kyle Herbert as Kamina and the infamous Steven Blum as Leeron, one of the most unique characters I've encountered in awhile.\nAll in all, reviews are meant to be opinionated, and I absolutely love this series, if for no other reason than to enjoy some quality action scenes with giant robots. It's the kind of series best enjoyed with your intellectual side turned down a notch. Crack open a beer, put on your nostalgia glasses and become enveloped in one hell of an animated ride. I'd recommend Gurren Lagann to just about everyone, except you pretentious folk. It may be some time before I rewatch it, but I know I'll sure as hell enjoy it just as much next time. Row row, fight da POWAH!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=40,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Another one of my all times favorite anime. From the intense storyline to the comedy purpose episodes, this anime was one that made me continue watching non stop.\nStory - To tell you the truth, I've never particularly liked mecha type animes. The only ones i recall watching and actually enjoyed were Gundam series. Usually these types of mecha anime fails to appeal to me halfway through the show, an example should be Eureka Seven. However Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is one series where you'll watch and be caught into the storyline. Also (warning spoiler ahead.. sort of.)\nI thought the way they did that 7 year\n          \n        time skip after defeating the Helix King was quite different from your average action based anime.\nArt - When i first saw Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann's cover, I disliked that art. I thought it was those typical shounen anime aimed towards boys at a young age. Man, was I wrong. Episode after episode I watched this anime and unknowingly i started loving the art style of this anime. From the ass-kicking Ganmens (Gunmens) to the pilot's of these ass-kickers, they were all very nicely done.\nSound - The sound in this show was purely awesome. I love how realistic the drilling sounds were i love the OP. The reason i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 was because Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann stuck to the same opening song the whole\ntime. As i clearly stated before, I loved the OP but after listening to the opening song so many times, it starts to become dull. They took the time to make 3 different opening videos in 27 episodes but did not change the song. That's the only flaw i found within the sound category. Also cannot forget to to mention the awesome sound track, Libera me from hell.. Best. Anime. Song. Ever.. I've listened to this song over and over.\nCharacters - The characters in this show were very well developed and tons of fun. I believe that most of the success from this show was due to the large amount of entertaining characters. Of course, if you like all the characters in this show, there would be no point in having a conflict, therefore there are also characters which you will hate their guts, but later find out what drives them to do such acts.\nEnjoyment - The enjoyment of one who can achieve through this series is truly, truly priceless. If you like mechas trying to send each other to oblivion, this series is for you. If you like comedy with a actual storyline, this series is for you. If you don't care about the storyline and just want some laughs, this series is for you. Basically you should try this series no matter what.\nOverall - Great anime, only one flaw i found and it wasn't even a major one that effects the show. Not much else to say about this. But anyways.. I highly recommend you to watch this anime.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=35,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    In a world of negativity, solitude, and despair, what can one hope to do?  Some might opt to resign to their miserable fates and accept the world around them, but this is not the case with Gurren Lagann.  The world of Gurren Lagann fixates on dedication and a focus on never giving up regardless of the dangers that lie in the near (or even far) future.  The spectrum of themes that appear throughout the story make Gurren Lagann a much deeper experience than one might initially perceive.  Even if one should, as the resident members of Team Dai-Gurren would say, kick\n          \n        logic and reason to the curb regarding the anime, the story offers a hot-blooded, high spirited tale that shows the high point of human potential and generates a very inspirational atmosphere throughout.\nGurren Lagann revolves around a young boy named Simon.  Shy, cowardly, and weak, he is anything but the type of protagonist you would expect after reading the previous description of the series.  This personality style is contrasted heavily by his older brother figure, Kamina.  Kamina is straightforward, outspoken, and charismatic, serving as the inspirational figure for Simon throughout the series.  The two live in the underground Giha Village and wish to break out to the surface.  This comes unexpectedly with the descent of a giant mecha, known as Gunmen, as well as Yoko Littner, a beautiful woman with a rifle.  Simon finds a small mecha, which Kamina quickly names Lagann, and the hectic clash for survival on the surface begins.  From this point on, the story progresses into one of those “fight for humanity” type of plots with a generally optimistic atmosphere.  As cliché as that sounds, Gurren Lagann has a way of appealing to the emotions and manages to make an old idea feel like an incredibly new experience overall.\nGurren Lagann appears to be a simple super robot action anime, complete with the outrageous intensity and the dramatic mecha transformation scenes.  Even its overall plot seems pretty straightforward and, according to some, perhaps even unoriginal.  On first glance, it is easy to assume that it is limited to the Shounen mecha range, but this could not be further from the truth.  While the premise is nothing new, Gurren Lagann manages to turn a somewhat typical tale into a masterpiece.  Once the plot begins to set in motion, the anime begins to focus on a variety of deeper themes, such as tragedy, despair, and betrayal.  While action and hot-blooded spirit are typically the most important focuses of the anime, it definitely leaves room for drama amongst the cast and even a decent amount of comedy, especially in the first part of the series.  A decent portion of this comedy even contains some parody in regard to super robot mecha series (I'm looking at you episode 3...).  Gurren Lagann fits in a number of elements that manage to blend surprisingly well together.\nEven with this in mind, the plot as a whole remains pretty simple and it is easy to question how such a story could possibly be so captivating.  This can be attributed to the lovable and very popular cast.  Simon, while starting off as a wimpy character, is a fantastic protagonist that deals with a great deal of hardship throughout the story and develops significantly.  Simon is my personal favorite of the cast if only because he struggles so much and manages to overcome everything, somehow becoming a symbol of what believing in oneself can do and just how far spirit and tenacity can take a person.  The hot-blooded and fan-favorite Kamina is also incredibly important to the story.  Kamina's spirit is the catalyst of all of the intense adventures that the heroes of Gurren Lagann experience and he serves as a figure of inspiration not only to the cast of Gurren Lagann, but also to those of the audience who look up to him.  Kamina's words serve to motivate Team Dai-Gurren throughout the entire story and many of Gurren Lagann's memorable quotes originated from the man himself.  Yoko, while an obvious source of fanservice for the viewers, plays the role of the badass female with a gun and is connected to a good number of the romantic developments of the story.  Nia, the polite and optimistic love interest of Simon, is one of the deepest characters Gurren Lagann has to offer.  Nia appears to just be a well-mannered princess of sorts, but her existence generates a number of twists throughout the story and add to the many underlying themes of Gurren Lagann as a whole.  The side cast, while not nearly as developed as the major characters, also have many lovable characteristics and provide their own contributions to the story.  While many of the villains are one-dimensional and ultimately serve as stepping stones to highlight the awesomeness of the heroes, the major antagonists prove to be much deeper than they initially appear and add to the thought-provoking ideas beneath the surface of the story.\nIn terms of visuals, Gurren Lagann does a great job for the most part.  The cartoony art definitely fits the Gainax style and it certainly makes some nods to previous Gainax works.  The style works well with the goofy and over-the-top nature of the story, but it doesn't lose its effect when the going gets serious.  In particular, the action scenes are typically very well done and this is most noticeable in the last few episodes, as the final battle truly boosts the scale of the fighting and adds to the intensity.  However, many fans remember the unusual Gurren Lagann Episode 4.  Episode 4, put into the hands of a guest director, had a drastic change in visuals, which many fans (including me) did not respond to very well.  The art felt like a massive downgrade and the characters looked completely unfitting, especially when compared to the previous episode.  Luckily, this is only the case with said episode and Gurren Lagann's visuals as a whole are as good as they need to be.\nAnd of course we can't forget about the sound department.  Gurren Lagann's OP song, Sorairo Days, is used for the entirety of the anime and fits perfectly with the tone of the series, indicating the inspiration that the characters (especially Simon) were filled with and their constant pursuit of a better future.  The two ED songs did not strike me as much, but were still catchy tracks.  Gurren Lagann also has a fantastic soundtrack with a number of notable songs, which fit perfectly for action scenes, dramatic moments, and relaxed times.  Many of the most memorable songs, as one would expect, lie in the action category.  However, my personal favorite track would easily be “Libera me” from Hell, which plays a few times during the second half of Gurren Lagann and, in some spectacular manner, manages to fit opera, rap, and orchestra together while making it sound amazing and perfectly fitting for the Gurren Lagann atmosphere.  Some have interpreted the two contrasting vocal styles of the song to represent the contrast between the Spirals and the Anti-Spirals, which certainly adds to the meaning of the lyrics.\nHaving watched the series in both Japanese and English, I can confidently say that watching either version is fine.  Overall the Japanese voices capture the hot-blooded essence of the story more, but the English actors still do a fantastic job and any dub fans will no doubt have a great time watching Gurren Lagann in English.  For the most part, the main cast is treated well in both versions.  Simon and Yoko both have very fitting roles in English and Japanese.  Kamina's seiyuu, Katsuyuki Konishi, does a fantastic job of expressing the badass, high intensity nature of his character and makes his role all the more memorable.  Kyle Hebert, while giving a different sound to Kamina's character, still manages to express Kamina well and, while not quite as energetic as Konishi, is still easy to get used to after some time.  Yukari Fukui does an excellent job of capturing Nia's character, and Hynden Walch does the same with Part 1 Nia.  In part 2, Nia's English voice actress switches to Bridget Hoffman, which is initially a major change that appears unnecessary but quickly proves to fit with the changes that Nia goes through during the post-time skip story.\nGurren Lagann is not perfect, and truth be told, no such story exists.  However, Gurren Lagann is a fantastic example of how a simple tale can provide so many meaningful messages.  Gurren Lagann is an inspiring story that details how a weak, dependent boy overcomes trials and even faces despair on multiple occasions to become a hero that can protect those whom he cares about.  When you're feeling down and in the worst place you can possibly be, the only possible option left is to drill to the heavens and believe in the you that believes in yourself.  It's interesting that a story with such simplicity can still provide not only huge enjoyment, but even a hope for the future.  At its core, Gurren Lagann is a story about a boy who must face the forces of the world, and eventually even the universe, for the sake of mankind.  It might sound generic, but perhaps it is for this very reason that Gurren Lagann can be appreciated for what it is.\nNote: This is my very first review on this site so I do hope that I have done a good job.  Reviews do take time and effort to craft so I hope that the work I put into this was ultimately worth your time.\n        "},

Very nice plot, very easy to follow while still holding a great message in it. TTGL keeps great action while also keeping true to the great message behind the plot.\nArt/Animation: 9\nB-E-A- YOUtiful animations in this anime. The fight scenes left me speechless at times and it really made you want to click 'Next'\n          \n        on the media player for the next episode. The art style is really reminscent of some of the earlier action animes that I have watched. Great FX used in the fights as well.\nSound: 8\nThe sounds in TTGL were simply breathtaking, explosions left you wanting more and more. The music score was also memorable, music was used nicely in the scenes. The addition of the english track was a little iffy though, in my opinion.\nCharacter: 10\nIf you've ever watched an anime and you simply loved every character, then you should watch this, because it is literally much better. The character development is very nicely done, from episode 1-27 you will get limitless amounts of satisfaction out of just watching the character's personalities come out and develop.\nEnjoyment: 10\nIf you're like me, when you watch an anime that is truly epic. You are feeling crappy by the end, not because it was a bad anime, but because you're sad that it's all over and you'll never be able to see those characters again. Simply put, the enjoyment I got out of this is too much for words. If I could somehow embed screams of joy into this review, I would.\nOverall: 10\nOkay, so overall the score works out to a 9.4. But really, the Story, character and enjoyment sections were WELL over a 10, so it's only fitting that this anime recieves that score. If you like fighting, boobs, comedy, drama and a great story.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=34,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    An anime about drills and robots. Yep, that’s Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Well, that’s not something you see everyday. Now, when I started watching this anime, I had a certain feeling inside me, a gut feeling that this anime would bore me because as far as I’m concerned, the mecha genre has long died. But hot damn, Gurren Lagann sure proved me wrong! This anime, although as cliché as hell, managed to turn me into something I thought I never would be, which is a mecha fan. Now, that might seem weird, seeing as I just said that it was cliché, but I will tell\n          \n        you the reasons why.\nStory: If I have to describe Gurren Lagann in one word, that word would be EPIC. But for you to enjoy it, you’ll have to turn your brain off. You see, Gurren Lagann is not something that was made not to be taken seriously. It is a comedy that relies on over the top action scenes and a lot of explosions to instill that sense of epicness in each scene. It isn’t he kind of anime wherein you’ll need to use your brain constantly just to enjoy the show; all you need to do is sit back, watch and enjoy. Also, as you would expect, the plot itself is pretty straightforward. MC finds a robot, MC goes on an adventure to defeat some evil king and gets a lot of friends and bigger robots along the way. You can also expect a lot of shouting, DBZ style. Well, that’s how it goes for the first half anyway. In the latter half, the story becomes a bit more serious, but not to the point wherein it’s not funny anymore, but of course, I won’t go deep into that. Overall, I give it a 9/10 for the simplicity of the story.\nAnimation and sound: The art is as you would expect, over the top during fights and pretty normal the rest of the time. Nothing really special, animation was smooth, faces were well drawn although the expressions sometimes look distorted, and the fights were sometimes shown from weird angles. Now, the soundtrack of Gurren Lagann though is a different story. It has literally one of the most EPIC BGMs that i’ve ever heard of out of all the animes that i’ve watched. Not to mention the opening, which is also pretty badass in its own right. Also, I would like to give special mention to pictures during the transitions, because they are just fucking epic. Overall i give animation a 9/10 and music a perfect 10/10.\nCharacters: What Gurren Lagann lacks in the plot, it makes up with the characters. This is where Gurren Lagann truly shines. The main character, Simon, is a weakling kid who has a habit of self depreciation who turns into a super badass character somewhere in the middle(think Tsuna). He has a silly backstory of being disliked by others because he smells bad, which i find stupid because he's a damn miner. The main female character, Yoko, is your tits and guns type of character who apparently likes to wear a bikini to battle just because she feels like it. Then there’s Kamina, the most badass and awesome character in the entire anime world (imho). The guy can is so awesome that he can read your homework and make it sound like a commandment from god. I mean, the can literally talk about anything and still come up with an epic speech about it.Now, although they seem reminiscent with other anime characters, they are unique in their own way. Each character has a certain depth to them, and at least they have personalities unlike in other animes, wherein the characters have the personality of a rock and the brain of a potato. Also, character development in this anime is very noticeable. Unlike other animes wherein development happens gradually, up to the point that it’s almost unnoticeable, character development in Gurren Lagann happens quickly through big, serious events throughout the story although it doesn’t just happen abruptly and is justifiable. Overall, i give it a 9/10.\nEnjoyment: When it comes to enjoyment, Gurren Lagann really delivers.I’ve never enjoyed a mecha anime as much as I did Gurren Lagann. To tell you frankly, Gurren Lagann doesn’t really have much to offer other than pure, brainless fun and enjoyment. It will make you laugh, it can give you an adrenaline rush, and sometimes it can make you cry. It’s one of the few animes that i enjoyed not because it has a great story, but just because it can make you feel happy without having to make you think. I find it unique in that aspect wherein an anime that doesn’t require you to think can keep you on the edge of your seat due to the sheer epicness of the character speeches and the fight scenes. I give it a perfect 10/10.\nOverall: Well, like all anime, Gurren Lagann is not everyone’s cup of coffee. You might like it, you might not, but for me I really liked it so all that’s left for me to say is that I give this anime a 9/10.\nOne thing that I would like to say is to those who plan to watch this series is that DON’T TAKE IT TO SERIOUSLY. It’s supposed to be a light-hearted anime wherein you just need to sit back, get some popcorn and prepare for awesomeness.  If you’re not a fan of humor or DBZ style action scenes wherein everything just literally blows up, then I suggest that you just try and give it a shot. Who knows, you might grow to love it.\nIf you liked this review then please give the helpful button a click, it means a lot to me.

Ever wanted to hear about the drill that can pierce through the heavens? Ever wanted so see a review intro be so repetitive and self-aware just to be funny? Ever wanted a show to have a legitimately good recap episode? Ever wanted to watch Gurren Lagann?\nI bet you said yes to only 7 of theose questions, didn't you? :/\nJokes aside, I bet the only question you want me to address is weather or not this show is good, if the 9 in the top right corner hasn't led you to your answer yet. Well, if you didn't look, or wanted something far less brief, let's find out, shall we?\nSTORY: 9/10\nLike I said, this show starts from the ground up, as two \"bros\" named Simon and Kamina encounter this mech head, and soon, a bigger mech head comes crashing from the surface, only for a hot sniper girl aka the punchline of age questionability aka Yoko Littner comes to assist their asses and take 'em to the surface, and our bombastic adventure begins from there. Admittedly, after episode 3, this show hits a bit of a rough patch for episodes 4-6 and I'll touch back on 4 and 5 in particular, but then episode 7 rolls around ensuring that most of the bull is over now and that this show's gonna go back to being awesome, and the same was to be said for Kamina, only for him to unknowingly give his best performance in the form of an unfortunate last stand with a death so shocking and out of left field, it became one of the most legendarily depressing deaths of anime history, something Simon could attest to given his angst for the best few episodes up until around episode 12 where after some words of encouragement from newcomer Nia, he accepts that he'll never be the man he idolized, and that he should man up and be his OWN badass. After an epic climax against our current villain Lodgenome, the leader behind these awful mechs piloted by beast men wreaking havoc on the surface, we end our first arc/half on a satisfying note, only for a legitimately nice recap to push the envelope further. \nNow we head into the second arc/half that ends up being the some of the bleakest, most finally different 4 episodes of the series given the sociopolitics present and how resentful many people are towards each other.. The problem is how out of place it feels, but it's nice to see a time skip actually be used effectively, let alone a 7 year time skip, in which, both things are a friggin' rarity to be used correctly. I still hate how Simon is basically vilified by everyone when if he didn't do anything, it would've all been worse, though in Rossiu's case, it was at least historically ad a political stunt. It also introduces us to our ULTIMATE main antagonist, the Anti-Spiral aka the whole reason why Lordgenome did the things he did up to and during the first half. After all that, the whole gang gets back together, including Viral, a minor antagonist/rival back in the first half, and they team up in the most increasingly over the top mech last stand series of battles ever in the history of anime, all culminating into an incredible and epic finale with great closure for just about everyone, and an epic final battle involving mechs that LITERALLY THROW GALAXIES AT EACH OTHER!!! Albeit, some things, like Nia dying, at not that neccessary, but overall, it was a great finale to a mostly great ride.\nAs for other pros, it showcases Simon's journey to manhood quite well, and eventually makes him such an amazing character the more he grows, especially in his adult life. It also has some rather emotional moments in both halves. As for the cons, there really is only one major con left. There is quite a lot of handwaving in this show, more so than most mech shows, when it comes to stuff like how shoving a robo head into a robo body suddenly makes it better rather than damaging it, or how absurdly quickly the tech rapidly grows, aside from the 7 year gap where that becomes a lot more excusable.\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\nLet's start with main protagonist Simon. He starts off as this timid and doubtful 12 year old that grows to idolize his bro Kamina and grow a crush on Yoko Littner. After Kamina's death, he gets depressed and a bit insane, showing how badly that death affected his mental state, until Nia shows up and he gradually becomes his own badass. It's only after the 7 year time skip in which he not only becomes my favorite character in the show, but one of my favorite characters in anime, becoming an even bigger and better version of the Kamina he knew at the start, and being such an epic action her despite the downward spiral of events, that he doesn't care that afterwards, he's the only one that becomes a nobody, even if I personally found that to be one last dickslap against Simon. As for Kamina, he started off badass yet dense, but with a lot of heart, but towards episode 5 in particular, his assholishness becomes a bit off putting, until episodes 7 and 8 showcase the best of Kamina in an epic yet tragic last stand with the most epic goodbye line you'll see in an anime. As for Yoko, she is the sniper girl with an almost tsundere-ish side, but is ultimately able to keep up with the boys in terms of badass mess over the course of the show. Also, she is probably the most unlucky character in the show. By that I mean, the has the kiss of death. No joke, the moment she kisses someone, they end up dying in the very best battle. As for everyone else, they are mostly very likable and bombastic, and that add to how much of a fun time this show is. The only problem is that the antagonists aren't nearly as interesting as anyone else. Well, at least most of the characters are consistently great, except for Rosseau. He kinda flip flops.\nART: 9/10\nOk, let's get the bad outta the way. Episode 4 looks terrible. The style they chose for this episode not only doesn't translate well into a full length episode, but looks far inferior to all of the other episodes of the series. If not for that, and the fact that overall the animation isn't entirely perfect (but rather impressive at times), this would be a 10. Nonetheless, this show on the whole looks pretty great, albeit unorthodox. The mech fights are over the top and cool to look at, and only get bigger and better over time, up until the finale where things get insane. The character and mech designs look much less serious than a typical mech show, and look as bombastic as Gainax is known for, if FLCL is any indication. The animation luckily never actually dips. While I'll touch on the EDs more throughly in a bit, the animation looks pretty damn awesome. One last note. Anyone really appreciate the eye catchers in every episode? Cuz I sure did.\nSOUND: 10/10\nThe OP, titled Sorario Days, is pretty good, until A. You realize that this is the OP for Gurren Lagann, and B. You listen to the full version, and C. Do both. Then, you realize just how kickass it is. I like the fact that in the second half, they use a different verse from the same song for the OP. For the EDs, ED 1 is cool and rather in touch of the early parts of the show. Now for ED 2, Minna no Peace. I love this ED. It is literally kickass, and embodies the awesomeness of Gurren Lagann, and is the moment that sealed the deal as to this show being on my favorites list, as well as the finale. This rockin' jam of awesome is a must-listen, and anyone who disagrees can go suck a heaven piercing drill and shove it up their ass. As for the rest of the music, while not overly memorable, really fit with the show, and the vocal tracks are nice as well. Gurren Lagann just isn't the same without 'em. Also, Libera me from Hell (the song with ROW ROW FIGHT THA POWAH) is pretty damn awesome and epic, with a very damn good combination of opera and rap into a melody perfect for the scale and bombasic nature of the show.\nOnto the dub. The dub is awesome. There's a reason people watch this show only in dub. It fits everyone perfectly. Yuri Lowenthal does a great Simon, and it's hilarious hearing Steve Blum do his gayest role yet; Leeroy. I don't recognize the other voice actors, but they do a bang up job at portraying the characters, so much so that they sound totally real, and so much so that I can't imagine them with any other voice, much less the sub. Also, Viral is played by the same guy who played Clovis from Code Geass (which is also amazing and has an amazing dub). Not one voice sounds remotely off or even like they're acting under a script. It's as if they are truly living the characters' lives through this dub, which is a rare thing to pull off to say the least.\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\nAside from a few rough patches, I enjoyed the living hell out of this show. The fights were bombastic as all hell, it had some good emotional moments, and some of the most epic final episodes you'll see in any anime, let alone a mech series. It just becomes a sheer spectacle to see just how much the next episode raises the bar, especially when the finale rolls around, and Galaxies get tossed around. Admittedly, I didn't really enjoy the start of the second arc (even if that was sort of intentional on the story's part), and I still can't accept a lot of what they hand-waived, but this show was still an immense and stylish joy to be had. It's easily among my top 10 favorite anime, at least at the time of writing.\nOVERALL: 9/10    RAW SCORE: 9.38/10\nIf you wanted something over the top back in '07-08, you only had three options: Code Geass, Gintama, or Gurren Lagann, all of which are critically claimed as some of the best anime of all time. This show is quite a ride, and if you can get past some of the problems of the earlier episodes, you'll find that this series is quite an epic mech anime, and a sight to behold. If you're that scrub that disagrees, then you can feel the galaxy throwing wrath of TENGEN TOPPA GURREN LAGANN!!!!!\nWith all that said, I bid you adieu.\n        "},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=23,   ["text"]="                          \n    Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann! JUST WHO THE HELL THINKS THIS IS GOOD?!!\n*No Helping It Soundtrack*\n\nGuren Lagann is like an eco-friendly waste disposal facility, it's well-organized, looks clean and colorful, and gives off a cheerful vibe, but ultimately it's still garbage.\nStory: Rather than going ham on this and have people \"enlighten\" me on how this is an \"over-the-top, just-for-fun, turn-your-brain-off\", I'll just explain why it fails even down that road. See, being over the top requires turning a cliché idea into a truly enjoyable one; something witty, or bizarre. TTGL does not offer that. It simply offers explosions. Then offers bigger explosions. Sadly, this only makes\n          \n        them less impactful. \nOver the top is when a squirrel conjured out of a first poses a threat on your life. TTGL is so much the opposite of over-the-top, that an explosion which is supposedly of a \"big bang explosion\" impact seems nothing more than your every-day Ki-blast. It tries to show how grand a battle is by having people in one instant fight among galaxies, but that just makes it look like galaxies are a zoomed-out back-drop.\nThis show completely fails at scoping and execution of scale, achieving the opposite of what it aims for.\n\nWill you enjoy the story if you're looking into something deep? No. The show does try to dwell on bigger ideas here and there (one scene 3 episodes apart on average), but they never follow up. \nWill you enjoy it if you're looking into something over the top as in \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventures, Hunter x Hunter, the Devil May Cry video games\"? No. The show has no wit or ingenuity.\nWho will enjoy this? If you like a monster-of-the-week format, and an extremely sped up version of Dragon Ball Z minus all the charging episodes, and the build up, or basically just explosions, this might be for you.\n\n\nCharacters, Interactions & Dialogue\nThe characters are one-dimensional, each one represents your typical shonen archetype. The hot-headed never-give-up main character, the nerdy, analytical, uptight buddy, the tsundere angsty nemesis, and so on.\nCharacters by themselves have nothing interesting to offer, and unfortunately neither do their interactions with one another. From the annoying Ted-Mosbian \"Bro\" exchanges that make you cringe, to the shouts of never giving up, (not even with a courtesy speech), the characters have no chemistry at all. \nThe dialogue, as you might find, is weak. It fails to express because its aim is to be as loud as possible. The show also suffers from the \"audience\" syndrome, where they feel the need to show you how awesome characters are by having some audience (random useless characters, or the entire planet) praise them endlessly. This is basically anime's version of laugh-tracks found in Sitcoms.\nArt & Animation\nThe art is quite sweet. It's got some pretty-looking settings and the designs for some mechs are pretty original. Unfortunately, animation does not keep up. I'm not sure if the anime had a good budget or not. Because there isn't anything to animate well in the first place. For a show with so many battles, there is no \"mêlee fights with sakuga choreography. Mostly it's just countless \"bulbs\" of explosions engulfing your screen.\nMusic\nNot much to say here, I'll keep it short, great opening, good OST, some tracks are marred with corny Bro-rap. \n\nIn conclusion, this is one of the worst shonens in recent years, but it serves as a good reminder that pretty covers aren't all. You might fight enjoyment only if you are a die-hard shonen/Michael Bay fan.\n\nOverall score: 3/10"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=20,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    I was surprised with Gurren Lagann, i'm not much into mechas but this anime has something special that makes you want to watch it and be eager to watch the next episode and i gotta say i was really enjoying it.\nStory\nThe story starts giving you a glance to the future in the first minute of the first episode, at first i thought that could be Kamina's father but i remembered what he got on his neck and the only one that has that is S. The story at first may seem simple and at first glance i thought it was going to have a funny\n          \n        story despite being simple, but i was found to be wrong after ep. 7 where the comedy is falling and falling each episode and the drama is rising, the drama being more present in the second arc, although the ending of the first arc was weak or i expected more from that fight and after the guy is beaten he says something i was expecting a lot of drama in the 2nd arc for just those mysterious words and i was right, the time skip happens and the story gets much better with a twist that i didn't expected despite especulating what was going to happen, i thought Wow could this be more than a masterpiece but i was spoting some flaws, a lot after ep. 20, it got absurd but i didn't mind it a lot because i was enjoying it, there's something that i found odd, Simon and Yoko didn't interact at all after ep. 7, why? not even as friends, didn't they interact a lot before that ep. even seeing him as a possible partner, like flirting and wanting to say something to him in matter of love, but now they don't interact, i felt she was cast aside and was a supporting character since that ep. 7 and she didn't even felt something for simon despite looking like Kamina, not that i wanted to ship them or anything, but it felt unatural that she didn't interacted with him or felt something for the obvious reasons, not that i liked Yoko either so... the ending was unsatisfyig, personally, it was bad, and i don't want to spoil but i will only mention that it was stupid, i felt empty with that ending and because of that i thought it couldn't be a masterpiece personally despite enjoying it a ton, so overall story is very good.\nArt & Animation\nThe art style is very good but sometimes it feels not constant and bad at some episodes and is not my kind of art style that i enjoy, i gotta mention it was very good, and the OP sequences are changing with the changes that the story encounters, the character desing is really good and Yoko for the fanservice.\nSound\nThe sound in every aspect was great, the backround music,sound effects, the OP and the first ED were great, the 2nd ED took out from me the drama feel after every ep. ending in some what moments the ED starts to roll and it didn't fit at all, the song is good but just because is good it doesn't mean it fits, the voice acting was outstanding but overall sound was great.\nCharacter\nThe characters were great, is what made the anime more enjoyable than what it is:\n-Kamina since the beginning is likeable, he has that vibe, he is very charismatic and manly, and when Yoko appeared i wanted them both to be together until she started to flirt with Simon i thought she was a slut and didn't like her.\n-Simon at first was wimpy, and a little affraid of keep going in their journey, as a character is the best, he changes a lot in the first arc just like when the time skip happens he has changed but not his ideals, he's still that person that wants to help the humanity and that's why i don't like the ending and is like no one cared that... almost spoil there but why did they let that happen.\n-Yoko the walking boobs and ass who flirted at first with Simon, then with Kamina, then wanting to say something to Simon regarding love (is obvious to spot it, that happened to me, maybe that's why i didn't like her doing that) then wanting to say to Kamina, then saying that if Simon becomes a good man she would like to marry him (and that happened, Simon becomes a badass) but for unknown reasons she almost never speaks with Simon, i mean why? and i wanted to like her but i couldn't because she is casted aside not having much interaction and being a support character without a story more than just fanservice which is nice tho. I could go on with the problems i had with her development but i would have to spoil things which i don't want to.\n-Nia, since she appeared i wanted simon to be with her, it kind of happened i think, but just like with simon i didn't like how she ended.\n-Viral is a cool character, since he appeared i thought he was going to be one of my favorite characters in the anime and he was a great nemesis, not nemesis in the story too.\nThere are a lot of characters that i could talk about, but it would be too long, so i got to mention that i didn't liked Rossiou, i liked almost every support character but i wouldn't care if some of them had a sad fate, i would say is cheap, and the villains are really impressive, Lordgenome is great when you get explanations, but yeah Yoko was a problem and the fate of a bunch of characters were cheap and that ending, unsatisfying fate.\nEnjoyment\nOutstanding and sure i enjoyed almost every single minute of this great anime, tho i would give it a higher score if it wasn't for that ending, i always give a good score when i really enjoy an anime, for example if i watched an anime that i really enjoyed but i knew the story was bad alongside with the art and sound, i wouldn't care, (not saying the story for this is bad, is very good like the art and great sound) is like with this anime i knew it wasn't perfect and i was thinking all the way this was a masterpiece but if the ending is not good i cannot be based only in enjoyment because a bad end makes me consider the other aspects, it hurts me not to give the anime a 10 but that ending hurted my enjoyment so i gave it a 9.5 in MAL is a 9 because there's no decimal system and i agree with the 10's given.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=30,   ["text"]="                          \n    -- [ Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann ] --\nIn one line: 'A fun trip with a fabulous crew, from start to end, and back to the start for another go! Nia is cute!! ~Nyaaaa!'\nOverall rating: 9/10\nBriefly, the story is about Simon, a driller. Pretty boring till now. It's also about Kamina, Simon's brother, and a lot of other people. The story is also about Spirals, Beastmen and the Anti-Spirals. A story about hippopotamus made of grapes. About mecha battles. About love. About tragedy. About courage in the face of adversity. About unfaltering determination against all odds. And specially, about huge mega powerups that make Dragon Ball\n          \n        characters seem sooo weak. Well, basically, it's ONE anime which you will really enjoy if you watch. Definitely recommended! Pardon me for the long review. :P\n-[ Animation - 8/10 ]-\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (TTGL) has one of the weirdest animation types I've ever seen. At the same time, it's also one of the most interesting I've got to watch. The characters are very well drawn, and the action scenes are always depicted with clarity, and are made to give you the feeling that everything is going very fast. There's also some shots which depict the characters as in manga drawing types. This adds to originality, since the only other anime I've seen that was in FLCL (Furi Kuri). The mechas are also well made, but they have kind of funny shapes. Like a starfish mecha? A worm mecha? A foot mecha? A hand mecha? You get the idea. They are more comical than realistic, but they are fun to watch. The mechas are almost living things. It's difficult to describe here, but it's not your generic artificial mecha type. There are not many landscape or cityscape scenes, but if they appear in TTGL, they were well detailed. The space shots later in the anime are particularly well made, with galaxies and stars being represented. It was... colourful!\n\n- [ Sound - 8.5/10 ] -\nI don't pay much attention to music in anime most of the time. I focus on the story, characters and action. TTGL does not disappoint in terms of music. The ones used in action scenes are fast and add the necessary punch to the action. The sound effects, particularly explosions, are not very realistic but they do the job. Characters are appropriately voiced, but for some of them, it does not reflect their characters very well. Like Kamina deserved a more powerful voice maybe. It's no major problem. Overall, the sound is ok, and works as it should.\n- [ Characters - 9/10] -\nFrankly, I've never seen such an interesting crew of characters since Eureka Seven. Each character plays a major role in the story. There are NO superfluous characters. Even the mole-pig has a role to play!! Each of the characters has a detailed background story, and each get an appropriate conclusion. The stories unfold at a very good pace, showing you the characters little by little, with some unexpected turns. Like the unfolding of Simon as Kamina's shadow, to Simon the universal leader. They also have very distinct personalities, that make a very good blend when added together to make TTGL. The mood-swings are there too! \nAll the main characters fit in very nicely in the story, and all the secondary characters add up to make a wonderful show out of TTGL. Even the villains are likable! I enjoyed going through the story with the crew, of that I'm sure. And well, Nia must surely be the cutest character ever shown in anime! :P\n- [ Story - 7/10] -\nThe story is a very good one. There are only very few plotholes, or parts that were not much elaborated on. It also has a good flow, and there are no fillers, except for a recap episode. You will get a fair share of action, tragedy, romance and suspence (unfortunately, these 2 don't last very long). The series is basically divided in 2. I call the first part, the Beastmen arc, and the second arc is the Anti-Spirals arc, following a time jump of 7 years. Each arc is well structured and well developed. Another feature which I liked is fore-shadowing. You will always get to see a tiny bit of what will happen in the future. Just like a spiral, it starts small, and ends up really big. Without spoiling, you will see somewhere that population level is being controlled in a village, and in the end, it's the whole universe population level that is controlled. That's the spiralling I was talking about. Starts small, ends up big! Reeeaaall big! Basically, it was a satisfying story. \nBut why the 7? Well, because the story is a bit too exaggerated. The main character always seem to output more power than a nuclear reactor. Saiyen 4 is nothing in comparison to Simon! They always seem to win, whatever happens. There is usage of some weird science concepts that would make the likes of Einstein and Hawking faint. Like somebody being converted into Spiral Energy to form a drill by quantum explosion?? Space jump just by thinking about your destination (here, a loved one)? W..T..F, it just can't be! \nThe series is a bit weird at the end, just like Eureka Seven. Use of weird concepts. Very weird happenings and similar events. Also the fights are sometimes just too unrealistic! Come'on, a million opponents, and you seem to kill them en-mass? Hell, there's even a mecha that resists the energy blast of the big bang, and another that releases that kind of energy!! It becomes real difficult to understand what's happening after episode 25. The concepts used are just too... strange! Like messing with probabilities, and so random shots actually hit all enemies. Can somebody explain how that happens?  &gt;.&lt;\nThat's just not realistic. 3 points lost to lack of realism, over-boosted good guys and because there is not enough long-lasting romance in the anime. It starts well, ends up real fast. Too fast. This series needs some more romance among main characters. However, the story is not too complex, not too technical, so you can just kick back and watch leisurely. \n- [ Enjoyment &amp; Rewatch - 8/10] -\nThe series was definitely enjoyable. The plot was non-linear and full of unexpected twists. Like a villain not being a villain? This makes things enjoyable. The action scenes are worth re-watching, as well as the character development. I personally enjoyed the anime, since I found a good blend of humour, lightness, ecchiness, tragedy, romance and action in it. I would say the anime has a rewatch value, probably to better understand the story, and the characters. 2 points lost because during the rewatch, you will still get that 'OMG! This is just overkill!' feeling. It's just too exaggerated, trust me.\n- [ Conclusions ] -\nIt was a great trip through TTGL. TTGL really got me stuck to my chair from the start to the end. The story was good. The characters were interesting and almost lovable. The action and plotlines were consistent. I've got nothing much to criticize about TTGL. So if you want an anime that has loads of action, huge character power-ups and is light at the same time, go for TTGL! Definitely worth it, and no regrets! :P\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=30,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Is it possible for this show to live up to the hype its been given? So so very nearly. Nothing can be perfect. But this should be almost better than anyone could hope for. Certainly was for me. \nIf you strip away the outer coating the story is nothing special really. It's just a nobody (surprise surprise, a kid) going from no one to someone on a journey that will be filled with epic moments &amp; the making of new friends, be them enemies once or not. Where have we heard this before? I wonder.\nSo there isn't anything that makes the story special? Well yeah,\n          \n        I suppose there is. But it's not the story itself, but what this show fills the story with. I can't stand anime with crap stories, however the story isn't really important here when you have all these amazing characters &amp; events happening, as long as the story means they keep coming. It doesn't matter how bad it is. \nThe art seems to often switch from style to style, sketchy, angular, cartoony, realistic (in an anime sense) &amp; ultimately I didn't think it worked all that well. It just often comes off cheap looking somehow. And the battles, they are often incredibly unclear, everything moves so fast (I'm not sure if this is on purpose or not) &amp; just becomes this sort of crazy blur. Or once again, loads of coloured lines &amp; balls of orange for explosions. It's like they took the same image &amp; changed one thing &amp; the background &amp; used it for the whole anime. I suppose the saving grace is the designs of everything. No matter how unclear, you can't deny that everything this anime does screams cool, while pointing it's finger up at the sky &amp; one leg placed on a raised object. \nSound. As amazing powerful as it is at first, you soon find it quite annoying, that basically every male character shouts rather than talks. I mean the lines start to become less epic when once again they are shouting them at the top of their lungs to some kind of funky coloured background. The voice actor cast is however, a good one. Even if you keep expecting Viral to shout bankai. I especially loved Kamina's voice (Japanese) this warm, strong voice, which is recognisable straight away &amp; will fill you with warmth &amp; joy everytime you hear it. Wow that was cheesy. In terms of music, this has arguably the best soundtrack in an anime ever &amp; they use the music perfectly. Except maybe the 'Roh roh, fight da powah!' stuff...\nThe characters in this are simply perfect, whether it comes to personality or design. And I suppose it is hard for me to explain why with such a large cast without spoiling. But I want you to, if you haven't already, watch this anime &amp; find out for yourself. Even characters who initially annoy you at first will end up doing something which gives them a place in your heart. Trust me on this. If nothing else I have written so far. \nEnjoyment. It will vary. The first 3 episodes are pure pleasure, but then it's rather dire from episode 4 (it almost feels like filler) until at least episode 8 where it picks up again then it becomes a rather stretched out slog of samey battles &amp; a bit rubbish. Unless you're easily entertained. And attempting to avoid spoilers, to your dismay you will soon find out after that, that everything you watched was pointless.  Then it takes more time for some reason &amp; finally the end comes around &amp; the brilliance pierces the heavens with it's drill. And I think that is possibly the one fault with TTGL. You can't get enough, but yet, at the same time, there is to much. Things are dragged out way to much, random things happen, which merely tack something onto the certain scene to make it last longer. Not really twists, more like they hadn't enough materiel to make the series as long as planned but refused to admit it. \nSo overall. I don't look back on this in any other way than joy. What an amazing thrill ride of pleasure this anime has been. I am thankful for all the times it made me cheer, smile, cry, laugh or simply scream at how cool it was. But it isn't without faults. There is a little to much man &amp; way to much ambition to call this perfect, or to truly live up to the hype. It is however, one of the best things you'll ever watch at this length. \n        "},

Before I explain why I will go over the ratings.\nStory - 10\nIt should  have scored higher if allowed...definitely. OK yeah it is a tribute to the old 70s GAR, but I wouldn't even categorize this anime. The story was pretty much fast paced and not a lot of things were explained. But that was not the point it was trying to get across. It has all the anime cliches but this is what most animes are trying not to do these days. They do it in a way that its so awesome\n          \n        you don't even think about it!No melodramatic bullshit that gets everyone down. Oh I cried (which I only do for those damn Key stories) but in a manly way. In fact I never cried so much from how awesome this is. The plot? EPIC. If you remember Outlaw Star's ending, omg that is like a speck compared to how epic this is. There is no other anime as epic as this. Oh and there is a little love story for you hopeless romantics. Just a tiny.\nArt - 10\nIt may not be the most detailed over-the-top produced realistic anime, but I give it props for being fantastic. The fight scenes were incredible. This show set a whole new level of explosions. THEY MADE explosions. The fashion is simple but great. But no one should be complaining about art when there is a show as important as this. (Although I advise to watch a high quality version of the show.)\nSound - 10\nAgain not the best where it pays attention to every detail, but from the things I hear, I'm not complaining. The show makes you see past these thinks as you're watching it. The music is epic. The voice actors are perfect for every character, I saw the dub and it sucks ass.\nCharacter - 10\nThe best part. Kamina...his attitude changed my life. As I was watching this, I remembered characters who had similar personalities like Great Teacher Onizuka but he blends it together and multiplies it by 100 with out actually too cheesy but awesome at the same time. Simon...I don't want to spoil, changes as the story progresses. Yoko is fucking hot and badass. The other characters are fun so fun loving. There is not one character I hate which is odd! I even like Leeron Jenkins. LEERON JENKINSSSSSSSS. Ahaha.\nEnjoyment- 1000\nI enjoyed every episode and almost every scene. I've watched many anime for many years. I haven't felt my spine tingling so much in such a long time and never felt the urge to yell and raise my fist and scream around my house. I love this anime.\nOverall - No number can rate this.\nNot even a 10. This show is undoubtedly a masterpiece. I have watched so many great anime. And I'm not talking about Inuyasha, Pokemon, Bleach BS. I give Gainax, the man who wrote the script, the director, and all the staff my hear-tfilled thank you. This is an anime I will never forget and hold dear to me.\nMy reason for writing this review:\nThis show did the impossible. Turned my whole attitude in life completely upside down when I was at the lowest point of my life. Over the course of the past 6 months, I let depression get the best of me as I lose myself, my friends, and everything around me. This summer, I developed social withdrawal and suicide attempts. I thought there was nothing left but to live like an empty shell till I died. After watching this, I know there will always be a new tomorrow waiting for me. I just have to get better on my own and be strong and NOT LET ANYTHING stop me from doing what I want.\nIf you haven't watched it. Watch it now. The reason I made an account and wrote a review is because I want other people to know how phenomenal this show is and an anime has never made me want to review.\nI will get started to watching this anime again (without tokin up and I'm sober right now).\nI hope they make a equally great sequel and I can't wait for the movie.\n'WHO THE HELL YOU THINK WE ARE!'\n        "},

It annoyed me how the characters just plowed through the show, invincible. The only thing the stereotypical story had going for it was that it made me want to keep watching more, to find out what was happening next.\nArt: I liked the art style, especially when they showed the clips during the middle interludes. I hated the fanservice. \nSound: the best part!! out of all the TTGL hype, what i hear about the OST may probably be true. the music keeps the show\n          \n        alive during the dry parts. \nCharacter: I greatly disliked the characters. They are all stereotypical shonen characters. The loud leader guy, the quiet sidekick who wants to be strong and has hidden potential, a fanservice girl. Nothing special. During parts of the show which were supposed to be emotional for the characters, I felt nothing at all because of lack of character development and overdone personalities. \nEnjoyment: I was going to rate this section a lot lower, but TTGL made me want to keep watching the show for some reason. The action scenes are overdone and extremely tiring to watch, especially since there were no breathers. Mecha just arent my thing\nPros \n- ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER! (pwnage battle music)\n- interesting art\nCons\n- people say that this show is EPIC? its just a typical shonen, nothing special. \n- overdone battle scenes, they get quite tiring and i couldnt wait for the battles to be over\n- bad fanservice\n- invincible and lame mecha\nIf you easily get fired up, or like shows that bring out your inner 'manliness', you may enjoy TTGL.\nOtherwise... its nothing special. Just another action anime that I can say Ive watched.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=28,   ["text"]="                          \n    I am truly amazed at how high this anime is ranked here on MAL. I'm guessing this is an indicator of how ignorant many people are as to what makes a good anime.\nFirstly, I admit that I watched Gurren Lagann a whole year ago, so my memory of it isn't 100% exact. However, I am constantly frustrated by how overhyped and overrated this anime is.\nStory: 5/10.\nThe plot is nothing but your average shounen anime 'feel-good' stuff. But oh wait Kamina the cool guy gets killed off early and then there's this OMG-monstrous 7 year timeskip to the 2nd part of the anime where everything becomes\n          \n        ridiculous...no correction LUDICROUS and FARCICAL. Taking on the whole universe...I mean seriously? Last time I checked 'epic' does not equal to 'enormous destruction that defies all logic, belief, etc etc'\nIf you're looking for action and plot, check something out that's at least more believable like Ao no Exorcist. Sorry guys, but TTGL really does not have a good story.\nArt: 5/10\nNothing special here. Blatantly shounen art, big mecha, big spaceships...all done before. Yoko the 'hottie' who should look something more like this:\nhttp://www.goodsmile.info/product/en/2446/Yoko+Real+Image+ver.html\nSound: 7/10\nOP was ok, this is probably what made Shoko Nakagawa considerably more famous. But OST is nothing to be ooh-ing and ahhh-ing about. It doesn't add much substance to the anime's atmosphere except to emphasise its already BLATANT SHOUNEN-ness. Hmm I think I already mentioned that didn't I?\nFor an anime that currently ranks just behind Kenshin: Trust & Betrayal, it is a complete insult to think that TTGL has sound and background music that remotely even compares to that. [Again I'm amazed at you diehard TTGL fans]\nCharacter: 4/10.\nAhh, now if this isn't the worst part...\nFor an anime that seems to take its plot seriously unlike gag animes like Gintama and Hayate no Gotoku, it needs good character development (even if it screams \"This is shounen!!\" for the 1000th time).\nAnd boy did we not get it.\nSimon is intially presented as nothing more than a wimp who relies on Kamina. Reminds me personally of Ganta from Deadman Wonderland but I have to say Ganta is more annoying. Anyway, after the time skip a completely different, Kamina-clone-type, carefree Simon emerges...and we have no idea how the hell this character change came about.\nYoko becomes a teacher...WOW. I don't believe this. So a gun-toting (supposedly 'smoking hot') chick who likes older guys  has a BIG change of heart and decides to suddenly settle down to help children. And still proves that she has the great body and fighting spirit when called up once again to 'protect the planet'. Geez, it couldn't get any worse could it?\nBut oh it does.\nI hear a lot of fans liked Kamina when he was still around. But he isn't around anymore is he? Which leaves us wondering how Simon's personality did some kind of teleportation to a parallel plane and came back with enhanced features like increased assertiveness and the hey-look-Rossiu's-arresting-me-but-meh-I-don't-give-a-damn attitude without Kamina teaching him some of his cool ass-kicking tricks.\nEnjoyment: I've ranted enough about this anime by now so yeah I gave this part a 6. I marathon'd this anime in like 3 weeknights hoping that it'd somehow get better after the spa episode but that dream never came about. And I'm generally a lenient 'rater', so this would easily deserve a 4 or 5 if I'd bothered to rewatch it (which I'm not going to do for at least another 2 full years).\nOverall: 6/10. If you can stand not having your logic obliterated by something that's often mislabelled as 'epic' and 'awesome' when it is totally ludicrous, overdone, unoriginal and seriously lacking in top quality that a 10th-ranked anime really should have, then yeah give it a try. I'm not stopping you.\nI guess there are really worse anime out there, but I really cbfed to tell you to avoid them. Use your own judgement pls."},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=27,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I marathoned this over 2 nights, and guess what? This anime is the most awesome anime I've ever seen, I was overwhelmed by the massive amounts of hot blood, epicness and manliness (This was the 2nd time I've ever encountered an anime which was considered epic), and I'll fucking tell you why.\nStory: You should already know it, I'll tell you what I think. Before I watched this show, when I heard the plot, face robots fighting, I thought this sounded utterly retarded, and very unappealing. But somehow, during Christmas, I was bored, downloaded GL, and my views took a quick 180 turn. The story was\n          \n        simply genius, only you had to see it personally for yourself. It started off rather small and humble, and as the anime progressed, the magnitude of the story started increasing, and it kept spiraling up until they were fighting to save and free the universe from the Anti-spiral. And it flowed smoothly. It wasn't all sudden and rushed, they built the story up until the end, and then finally unleashed it.\nArt: The animation in Gurren Lagann was fuck-awesome all the way, be it battle animations, character animations, etc. It's drawn in quite a 'rough', rugged form, which many may not truly appreciate, but it was what made Gurren Lagann stand out so much, because it allowed for crazy-ass facial expressions, explosions and fights to look really great. They also used a whole range of colours, making this show a wonderful visual experience. My only pet peeves were episode 4 (I almost dropped it because of the QUALITY animation) and that in a few cases the characters look over-simplified.\nSound: Know what? Throughout the show, the positive, inspirational music gave me the shivers whenever I heard it. It was that awesome. Tracks like Libera me from Hell, Omae no XXX de Ten wo Tsuke!, Sorario Days, they made the anime truly stand out in those instance of manliness and awesomeness. The VAs, especially Kamina's did a fantastic job into putting emotions behind their character's voices (Although Simon's pre-timeskip VA didn't quite have the manly vibe as he did later on).\nCharacter: Yeah yeah, 'they're so cliche'- FUCK YOU. True, the characters seem quite generic, but they often take their cliche and take it to the max, in a positive way. Also, if you look closely, the characters do not totally fit into their cliche, they always have something which defies it e.g. Simon, who was cowardly and pessimistic in the beginning, but did have rare instances where he showed true courage and determination, and he actually became the opposite of what he originally was, and not by a sudden whim (He actually spent 3 episodes going emo before he changed for the better), which made it all so more fitting and natural. The characters were also extremely enjoyable to watch, and likeable, especially Kamina, whose charisma, determinism and manliness made him so damn appealing. The only thing that felt out of place was that they don't focus much on the side characters until near the end, where their unforgettable sacrifices helped the advance the Gurren-Dan.\nEnjoyment: Did I enjoy Gurren Lagann? Every fucking minute of minute, from the beginning to the end. I loved the awesome Ganmen fights, the crazy inspirational speeches Kamina gave, and especially the fucking epic final fight (Throwing galaxies around? How can you get more awesome than this?) I got those shivers every time there was a big fight, and I wanted to shout out and cheer the Gurren-Dan on, because it was THAT enjoyable. This anime simply makes you want to become a part of the goddamn action, and it was the only time I cried manly tears because a character died. I also enjoyed the gratituous fanservice that was abundant throughout the whole show, although I did sadface a bit when it was tuned down during the later episodes. This show is not for the tight-panted, uptight pricks who feel that logic and reason have to apply for everything, and it even declares it itself, ' OVERCOME THE IMPOSSIBLE AND KICK REASON TO THE CURB'. Forget higher thinking when watching this, just enjoy it as much as you can.\n Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is currently my number one, favourite anime. It took manliness, determination, epicness and hot blood all the way to the max. It was so positive, optimistic and hopeful, it's like the cure to all things pessimistic (Ant-EVA much?) It is impossible not to enjoy all this GAR and epic awesomeness which is presented to frequently throughout the series. TTGL is simply a masterpiece, and whilst it is not perfect, it comes damn close of it, and it is one of the few animes which truly deserve the overall rating of 10. Don't believe me? Watch it yourself, I will guarantee you that you will enjoy it (But you'll probably go beyond and fucking love it).  \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=26,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Epic, is probably the word that best describes this anime.\nIt all begins with Kamina and Simon living their seemingly insignificant lives in one of many underground villages scattered throughout Earth.\nThis changes when a huge 'ganmen' (a huge mecha) comes crashing through the roof of the underground village, revealing the surface and opening up a whole new world for Kamina and Simon.\nThe art seems to be an acquired taste for some, I however found it very easy on the eyes and liked it instantly. There were scenes that I didn't like the way they drew something, but this was a very rare occurance and the artwork\n          \n        really fit the show.\n\nThe music is very good and usually fits the mood perfectly throughout the show.\nThere were times when I wished they would've used a different song, but the music was definately top notch.\nThere were alot of very interesting characters in this show.\nKamina, a man willing to do anything to fulfill his wishes (sometimes you'd think he has a death wish that he is trying to fulfill) will instantly draw you in with his fiery speeches and crazy actions.\nSimon, seemingly weak at first, really evolves during the series and you will no doubt grow attached to him as you keep watching.\nYoko delivers fan service, a huge gun, some lovin and has a very laid back attitude, what more can you ask for?\nOverall the character development in the series is very good, you can really tell how they all grow and change from what they've experienced.\nObviously, I enjoyed this show very much and I think anyone who has seen the whole thing will enjoy it tremendously, be you a mecha fan or not.\nSomething I'd like to point out that I liked is that there are some moral/political issues in all of this, while in the beginning of the series you can quite easily tell which side is supposed to be the 'good' side, as the plot unfolds things happen that could make you question what is really right and wrong.\nIt's quite obvious what views the creators of the series have on certain things, and it's an interesting thing to think on if you compare alot of the issues they bring up to real life issues (i.e to kick reason to the curb and attempt the impossible fighting for your freedom or to save as much as you can and keep on living under someone elses conditions.)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=26,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Story: 9/10. Simply Outstanding story! I enjoyed it from start to end. It digs deep (no pun intended) into the emotions and practically rips them out. And I admit that despite a somewhat simplistic plot. You can easily get drawn in it. My only complaint is the final battle in the last episode, and the epilogue with Simon.\nArt: 7/10. The artwork is pretty good. Since Im more used to work from visual novels the score is lower here. The art possessed several qualities from the  last series I watched from Gainax, FLCL, with some enhanced modifications. The artwork definitely captures the heart of the\n          \n        story and the show. While there were some scene that were breath-taking, There were a few areas where the art dropped a bit. But the technique seems up-to-date in almost all aspects.\nSound: 10/10. What I consider a great strength in the show the music was fairly captivating. It seemed to put you in the right mood while watching. It takes the scene and enhances the emotions to leave a more lasting impression for the viewers.\nCharacter: 9/10: Another great strength of the series. I am a sucker when it comes to characters with idealistic dreams and goals. But, the characters also seem to reflect other questions and morals that dig deep into your emotions and has you consider them.\nEnjoyment: 10/10. I simply loved this show from start to finish. I have marked it as my favorite mecha anime of all time. I have recommended it to almost all the watchers I know. And I still enjoy rewatching my favorite episodes from time to time, and enjoyed as much as when I first downloaded it.\nOverall: 9/10~10/10. One of my favorites from Gainax. What I see as a truely a masterpiece of the decade, and probably one of my top choices of Anime of 2007. I will always be a GAR head and a great fan of the series. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=25,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    At first, I was apprehensive about watching this anime because I am not a big mecha fan and I hate kid anime characters.  However, this show really sucked me in after the first few episodes and I found myself wanting more and more.\nThe story is simple and easy to follow.  Kid acquires a special power and progressively gets stronger and stronger while fighting tougher opponents and gaining supporters.  It was very predictable but the story was never intended to be the main attraction.  It was the playground and you were just happy to be in the sandbox with all your friends.\nLike\n          \n        the story, the art was not one of the show's key elements.  A lot of the characters look completely unrealistic and so do the mecha.  It takes some getting used to, but surprisingly, the art detracted very little from the show because the other elements more than compensated.\nFor example, the sound was very good.  A lot of the background music they used really gets you in the mood to go work out and burn off some testosterone.  I was also a fan of the opening song and never skipped the intro all 27 episodes (something I do often).\nThe real attraction of the show is the characters.  They were all so GAR!  Everytime they pulled off the impossible you find yourself cheering for them like you were watching your favorite sports team win a game.  Simon was probably my favorite as I found him to be a very realistic character and could often relate to him.  Watching him transform from Simon the shy to Simon the Gar was one of the most enjoyable transformations I have seen.  He is the Rocky of anime.  Kamina was also a fun and lovable character who you will certainly enjoy if you like guys who act like idiots but have big hearts and charisma to make up for it.  As for the females, Yoko was great fanservice material but also a great character in her own right.  She was complex; she had a tough and tomboyish personality at first but you see that underneath she is such a warm and compassionate individual.  I think she is a great feminist symbol as she is able to balance both very well.  As for Nia, she reminded me of Tessa from FMP.  So smart yet naive and incredibly cute.  Her heart and speeches were very inspirational.  Overall, these characters all added unique dimensions to the series and really attach themselves to you.\nAs for enjoyment, I had to rest after each episode to reflect on how awesome they were because I got too pumped.  It's one heck of a ride and one I would gladly go on more than once.  The action and suspense keeps building and 'spiraling' up.  There were many points in the show where you would think there was no where left to go and yet they keep moving forward.  Each episode topped the previous episode and you just can't help but smile and laugh as your favorite characters grow with you. \nThe bottom line is that if you are looking for entertainment and lovable characters I know you will love this show.  However, if you are unable to look past several of the drawbacks (mecha, simple story, and unrealistic art) then you might not enjoy it as much.  In the end, you will enjoy this show no matter what your tastes are and you will be craving more when you finish.\n"},

I write this review on a purely subjective perspective, but if you give the main character of the show a LITERAL plot device that ensure he wins as long as he believes in himself then that basically wraps up the whole story.

		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=24,   ["text"]="                          \n    This is my first review. \nTengen Toppa Gurren Laggan was an interesting anime, to say the least. It had its good moments and bad moments. Overall I was able to finish it, but it took a lot longer then expected, and at times it was crap. \n\"Kick logic out and make the impossible possible\" \nThat is the motto for team Gurren, and is certainly an understatement given what they end up doing. \nI have to say, for those like me, who focus more on story and character development, it was rather satisfying in those areas, however I disliked the unrealistic components and lack of logic\n          \n        behind almost every decision/out come in every battle. \nStory: 5\nIt had ups and downs, some absolutely brilliantly written and thought out episodes, and then some crappy doesn't make any sense episodes. I prefer animes where logic actually matters and what happens sorta makes sense, rather then beyond beyond the impossible. \nIn fact: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible\ngives reference to it as the only anime to go beyond beyond the impossible. \nArt: 2\nLast time I checked, this was aired in 2007, not 1992. If I am wrong and it was made in 1992, notify me so I can raise this to a 4, for being on par with its time. Given that his anime has nothing but cheesy battle scenes, art is rather needed. \nSound: 6\nfairly good sound track.\nCharacters:\nKamina for his actions in the first 7 episodes and Rossiu for his actions in episode 19 and 20, put them on the list of greatest characters of all time.\nEnjoyment: 3\n3 times while watching it, I put it down for a week, and if it wasn't for my friend pushing me to finish it, I doubt I would have. I like animes that don't have to many unrealistic events, and when unrealistic events come up, characters don't spout **** to explain how they are possible, when they clearly aren't. Its not entertaining to watch the same event happen over and over again, and I dropped Bleach for the same reason that I didn't like this anime.\n\nOverall: 5\nIt was a mediocre anime and I don't understand why its so popular and highly ranked. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=24,   ["text"]="                          \n    \"This is the drill that will pierce the heavens\" and by heavens I mean the anime world.\nAfter watching brilliant animes you get this feeling of \"WHAT DO I DO IN LIFE NOW\" \nWell I've got this feeling at the moment and so I thought, hell might as well make a review on it since I'm so revved up, you get it revved up? drills rev? OHHOHOHOHO. Nevermind.\nGurren Lagann is an evolved product of the Japanese animation industry, setting new standards for the entire industry. It is only fitting that the basic underlying theme this anime tackles is also centered around “progress” and “evolution”. Taking a\n          \n        modest start, the anime slowly grows and develops it story and characters, ultimately building up to a tale of epic proportions. All of this and more is done in the rather impressive and constrictive episode length of 27 episodes, which is an impressive feat on it’s own.\nGurren Lagann has a killer story, but it’s amazing plot would be nothing without it’s amazing cast of characters that take the huge burden of the story on their shoulders and drive it along. It can be arguably said that Kamina himself is the main star for the first few episodes, and amazingly drives everyone and everything in the story. Then the other characters get their own chances to shine as the story continues. Simon, who’s always overshadowed by his “Aniki” (Brother figure) slowly becomes his own man, while continuing the traditions and ideas of his brother, and you see more and more of Kamina in his younger brother.\nMany characters come in, and not one of them feel useless at all. The series is jam packed with lovable characters, both as inspiring heroes and as cool villains. It’s amazing how well all of these characters are maintained, keeping in mind how much they grow and change throughout the series. Even as they mature and change, however, they never stray a bit from their core personalities and that’s an amazing accomplishment in its own right. Some characters earn your respect even more as they perform their various role in the stories, while others become hated for their acts.\nThe sound is excellent. The voice acting in particular, is exceptional. Half the greatness of the characters comes from their dialogue and how well it’s done by the voice actors. Props to all the voice actors in the anime, as they do a terrific job and add a lot of depth to their characters. The music is also exceptionally well done, from the intro music, to the music used during the battle scenes. The sound is as good as it can get with this anime.\nMecha designs and everything also evolves much like the story and general artistic presentation of the anime. In the end, the only real flaw of the art of how it can actually be a reason to put off people from an exceptionally great anime, because not everyone wants pantyshots and 14 year olds with D cups. On the other hand, the trade-off of taking a bit of discomfort in the first episode is the great experience that every anime fan would take way from this show and it’s superb story!\nAs far as the visuals go, Gurren Lagann not only steamrolls through uncharted boundaries, it also makes everything feel completely off the wall. Gainax is still the king of giant robot fight scenes, and goddamnit, they prove it over and over again in this anime. Absolutely no expense is spared in the animation, and the grandiose music definitely captures the sheer magnitude of events.\nProbably the most surprising thing about the series though is that - despite how ridiculous it is - I have found myself getting rather emotionally invested on both occasions where I’ve watched it. The show is unabashedly sentimental, and whilst sentimentality isn’t always my thing (and speeches about how “the human race will triumph” REALLY aren’t my thing) it works for me here slotting in to how over the top everything is. It’s part of the of the odd contradictory nature of what makes the show so good that it can be both a parody (leading to humour and fun) and yet also sincere (leading to sadness).\nIf you are the type of person willing to scream “THIS IS SO EPPPPIIIICCCC” as the protagonist gives a bombastic speech about self-confidence in a massive, sunglass totting robot, then be sure to check out this anime. \nGurren Lagann really did surpass my expectations in every way as I had thought it was just a over-hyped anime and the fact that I'm not an overly huge fan of the mecha genre. It’s not necessarily perfect, but it does manage to make you feel sad,happy and excited in a manner that caught me quite off-guard. It’s easy to see why this series is held in such high regard by the anime community.\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=24,   ["text"]="\n\n\n	If you’re looking to break your record for “shortest time taken to watch a full anime series,” you might be recommended “Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.” It’s enveloping, gripping, sit on the edge of your seat and wake your neighbours at 2 am in the morning screaming “FUCK YEAH” cause you’re the kind of insensitive prick that would do that-awesome. I know it’s not cool to say you love a series, but I loved Gurren Lagann, and I’m generally not a fan of mech shows.\n	To begin, sit yourself down in some bizarre future (does it still count as bizarre if every future that anime depicts is\n          \n        just as eccentric?) where the human race has been condemned to live underground, and meet Kamina and Simon. Kamina can immediately be added to your list of men you’d trade your left nut to become. He’s dynamic, incredible, a truly inspiring leader, and a character that will leave a lasting impression upon you long after you’ve finished watching. Then get introduced to Yoko, who immediately comes off as the token fan service of the show, but swiftly, takes on the role of badass heroine with a gun. With these 3 combined, we can set off on an adventure to crush a world government, fueled entirely (no joke, this is how it works) by MANLY SPIRIT and drills. This series made me realize that DRILLS ARE FUCKING AWESOME.\n	The series follows a liberation movement fighting off the Beast men, current rulers of the planet, to achieve freedom for mankind, in spite of overwhelming odds. The feeling you get while watching this series is similar to the one you get from watching “300.” The protagonists are outnumbered a million to one, yet prevail solely through MANLY SPIRIT (it’d be a crime not to capitalize that). And of course, it’s all done fighting in giant robots with amusing faces. What probably grabs you the most though, is the simple fact that the laws of physics can be overturned by sheer purified and concentrated willpower, and then reconvened in the form of a massive drill which will likely pierce the heavens. And trust me, you’ll never get enough of it. The art style and animation coalesce with the brilliant storytelling and character dynamic to produce an adventure that will leave you wanting more. Gurren Lagann itself is pretty much an internet meme representing unadulterated awesome, and if that doesn’t impress you, you probably lay golden eggs and have flatus that smells like cinnamon buns, leading to a surprisingly pleasant combination of cinnamon bun flavoured breakfasts.\n	There is one main criticism I’d make towards Gurren Lagann though. Midway through the series, you get hit smack in the face with a completely different feel to the story. It’s as if you just beat up a bear with your bare hands (or it’s bear hands, either will do), and then get tossed into a My Chemical Romance concert. You fumble around for a bit, trying to figure out where the fucking door is, and leave as soon as possible. But you’re stuck with the experience, you were there. Your mind will immediately block it out in favour of more epic memories, likely involving drills, but your time spent there still happened.\n	In summary: Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a story of overwhelming odds, overcome by extreme overproduction of testosterone induced spirit. The animation is absolutely stunning, brilliant, awesome, and the characters are dynamic, interesting and loveable. It’s a great series, by far one of the best you’ll ever see, and saying “I can highly recommend it” doesn’t do it justice. Go watch this show."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=24,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Review\nSo rare does an anime of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann's caliber come around, an anime that leaves you on the edge of your seat dying to know what happens next. My journey with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann was a long journey full of emotions. Let me start this review by explaining my reasoning behind my ratings.\nStory-9/10\nThe story behind Gurren Lagann is the classic story of a boy's coming-of-age, dealing with endless trials and ultimately saving the world. The reason I gave this cliched story a 9 is because of the way that GAINAX portrayed it. Each moment is flawlessly executed, never\n          \n        boring you and always gripping your heart's emotions whether that be happiness, sadness, laughter, joy, anxiety, or hate.This cliched and rusted story was formed into a shining drill capable of piercing through the heavens.\nArt-9/10\nThe art style in this anime is a very beautiful style that will leave you gasping and rewinding a scene simply to see it again. However, at times the art can be mildly confusing but even this confusion fits in extremely well with the anime and it is a very brief confusion. I cannot express how beautiful some scenes in Gurren Lagann are. In Gurren Lagann pictures aren't worth a thousand words. They're worth even more.\nSound-10/10\nThe music in Gurren Lagann is mixed in with the art and the story masterfully well. The songs will generate the perfect tone for a scene, and will leave you in awe or get you so pumped up you'll feel ready to take on the world. Even if you don't watch the anime, you need to get it's soundtrack, it's so amazing. Admittedly, some of the English lyrics in the songs don't make sense, but the melody itself will rock you.\nCharacter-10/10\nThis is where Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann truly shines. The characters are, like the storyline, cliched archetypes but they have so much emotion in them that they don't feel like a cliche at all. Unlike many anime out there, the character development in Gurren Lagann is huge and will leave you endeared to each character. Every character is dynamic and has good points and bad points as well as separate motivations for each one's drive. Each character feels real to you, and bad guys aren't bad guys simply because they feel like it. The characters in Gurren Lagann are ones that you will enjoy for sure.\nEnjoyment-10/10\nGoing back to my introduction sentence, 'So rare does an anime of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann's caliber come around, an anime that leaves you at the edge of your seat dying to know what happens next.' it is clear that I enjoyed Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. There is a reason why it is number 1 anime on myanimelist.net, and that is because countless people have enjoyed it and been in awe because of it. My enjoyment of this series is based on everything I've written about, all my explanations of my ratings. Enjoyment is highly subjective however, so it is best if you watch it yourself.\nOverall-10/10\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is packed with action, tears, laughter, sadness, and many other emotions. The story line, art, sound and characters are all amazing and very well done. However, what makes this series a 10/10 is the messages that it sends. Hope for the human race and hope for advancing forwards bit by bit. TTGL also delves heavily into the ideas of evolution and into religion as well. Truely an amazing anime from GAINAX.\nConclusion\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a must watch anime that is practically guaranteed for people of all ages to enjoy. There is more than enough action to keep kids happy, and many ideas that will keep adults intrigued. And lastly, an anime like this is, once again, a very rare thing indeed. I am constantly drifting from anime to anime, discouraged by what I see, constantly searching for one of those rare special anime that will blow me away. Not only did Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann blow me away, it blew me into another dimension. Very few anime can do something like that.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=24,   ["text"]="                          \n    Lemme put in my own opinion...\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is perhaps... Screw that, THE most over the top thing you will likely see for a while. You know that whole 'OVER 9000!!' Meme on the internet? In here it's more like 'OVER 999999999...!' and going onwards.\nLet's get in the meat of the stuff.\n\nStory: The story is basically about a kid named Simon and how he goes from the sidekick of suicidally courageous moron Kamina to asskicker extraordinaire in a journey riddled with Mecha, asskicking and believing in yourself so much that your enemies will be wiped out by your awesomeness. The plot is divided into\n          \n        two parts. The first is about Simon as a young child and growing badass while the second is about Simon as a young adult reaching the pinnacle of his badassedness. Not gonna give any more details in case of spoilers.\nEverything is standard anime cliche take to the extreme, particularly the whole 'DETERMINATION TRUMPS ALLl!' and 'WE ARE THE GOOD GUYS AND YOU ALL SUCK!! MUA HA HA!!!'. This is defined by the catchphrases 'Beyond the Impossible' and 'Kick Reason to the Curb'. I myself have quite the distaste for those tropes and as such found everything involving such as parody and I would describe this as the 'Feel Good Comedy of the Year'.\nArt: The artstyle and animation is amazingly exaggerated. The Mecha designs are unique and weird in a fun  and wacky way. Since this is Gainax do expect the females to have that extra bounce (Giggedy), especially Yoko, whose costume is usually limited to bras and skirts/spanky pants. The fight scenes are incredibly well-done as well as insane. Chances are people watching this will have the reactions of 'HOLY DAMN THAT WAS AWESOME!' to 'DID HE JUST DO THAT?!'. That seems to be the popular consensus.\nSound: There's a lot of inspirational shouting as well as music to pump you up for the mood. A repeated line in the songs of the later parts of the series is 'Row row fight the powah!' which sort of fits into the stuff. Voice Acting is decent enough for the inspirational shouting, with the classic monologues being done by Kamina, whose talents include making big gestures and dramataic speeches and... That's about it...\nCharacters: Do expect some cliches here and there. Kamina is the basic 'Shonen Hero with a will of pure adamantium laced with whatever indestructive material' and is insanely overdramatic. Unfortunately (in my opinion) he lacks the wits for anything and as thus is incredibly reckless and suicidal but has the charisma to have people be as sucidial as him. Simon, his lackey and the true main character of the series eventually takes after him in this effect, but still maintains common sense (which Kamina seems to abhor). \nThere are other characters such as Rossiu, Simon's companion whom they meet and serves as the cool-headed intelligent one, Yoko, the female lead of the series and the provider of approximately 90% of the fanservice since (as mentioned above) she wears nothing but a bra and some skirts/spanky pants, Viral who serves as a rival to Kamina and eventually Simon, Nia who serves as Simon's love interest and a whole bunch of other side characters who I cannot bother remembering. A few tend to serve as 'Guy who is there' and serve no important role save for being part of Kamina/Simon's Redshirt Army so don't bother attempting to remember all their names.\nEnjoyment: Despite some criticisms I had a grand time watching the series. It filled me with an amused feeling that I rarely get from other shows. I'm not going to bother rewatching the series though since I rarely rewatch/reread stuff.\nOverall, this is a fun series for those who are not willing to take everything seriously and just take it as something to be watched for fun. As a non-fan of most Mecha series I liked everything. I recommend it for anybody just wishing to find something fun to watch, though don't try to find any thought-provoking arguments/philosophies behind it all.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    	When I was a kid, I remember my dad driving my family to the Regal theater down the street for another installment of the Transformers franchise (Yes, the one lorded over by the incomparable Michael Bay). My father, a huge Transformers fan since pre-adolescence, followed this same routine every time Bay released one of those movies. I personally loved this family tradition as a child because I thought that the plot was always super-intense, that Optimus Prime was the coolest, that the fight scenes were incredibly dope,  and that Megan Fox was the sexiest person ever. Over time, I matured, my viewpoint of the\n          \n        Transformers franchise becoming more subjective and critical. I realized that the plot leans towards the generic, that Optimus Prime is little more than a rust-consumed relic, that the fight scenes are unnecessarily lengthy, that Megan Fox was a forgettable face in the film industry, and that this whole mess is spearheaded by a financially-insane director who cares more about babes, explosions, and big robot fights than creating a film with real substance. That last part was what ultimately turned me off about the Transformers franchise and the mecha genre itself. For the longest time, I upheld the promise I made to myself to never expose myself to anime titles with a big focus on robots… and then Gurren Lagann entered into my life. At first, I didn’t want to watch this seriously-popular series for three reasons: it’s a mecha anime, one of its main characters (Yoko Littner) has become an Internet sensation due entirely to being a fanserivce tool, and it was produced by Gainax (the same studio that introduced the disaster known as FLCL into the anime world). At the time, if you had told me that I would write a mostly positive review for Gurren Lagann, that I would consider one of the main characters as nothing less than an icon, and that I would praise this anime as one of my five favorite series ever, I would’ve call you crazy.\n	The only reason why I decided to check out Lagann was because I believe in second chances, and that I judged the mecha genre too harshly. What pulled me into this show from the beginning was its spectacular theme song (I love how the theme song ends the same way it begins). After the theme song concludes to begin Gurren Lagann’s pilot episode, the show almost immediately establishes its premise: to follow the adventure towards freedom with the three main characters: (in order of increasing importance from least to greatest) Yoko Littner, my favorite character Kamina (I’ll get to him later; a couple of sentences here isn’t good enough for this guy), and Simon (pronounced “Sea-moan” in the dubbed version). In the beginning, Simon is a young boy in early adolescence, struggling to find his identity and purpose in life, but (unlike all the other main characters in anime that happen to be teenagers) he never digresses into some whiny, pessimistic, angst-machine. At a slow yet realistic pace, Simon develops into a warrior of the highest order; this process is highlighted by Simon’s speech in episode 11 (just an absolute Hall-of-Fame scene, an unforgettable “this is what anime is all about” moment) and concludes in the last seven-or-so episodes in the series, where Simon consistently delivers space-shattering attacks and immortal speeches while donning a visual masterpiece of an outfit. The depth, attention to detail, and passion involved in Simon’s characterization is among my favorite aspects about Gurren Lagann.\n	On the show’s voyage towards freedom, Gurren Lagann brings other characters into the fold. Rossiu is at first this anime’s resident analytical quiet guy but, later on, he evolves into a psychologically tortured do-gooder with a cold-hearted exterior. Nia is the token shy, hypersensitive girl; however, her overtrusting tendencies are what makes Nia unique from the others and this, along with a truly traumatic backstory, is why Nia is my second favorite character in Gurren Lagann (What also helped was Hynden Walch’s angelic voice in her role as the benevolent young princess). Viral throws himself into the show as a supporting character who views himself as Kamina’s foil but he slowly becomes an honorable antihero that establishes a friendly rivalry with Simon (This climaxes at the very end of episode 21, where (together) they pull off a huge speech in preparation for battle). Kittan is my least favorite character, an egotistical blondie who comes across as the poor man’s Kamina (what severely damaged my opinion of the guy was in episodes 9 to 11, where he snatched Simon’s role as captain and digressed into the belittling jerk of jerks) but Kittan becomes his own man in his finale battle, where he screams “I ain’t sayin no showy crap like ‘Later, buddy’ or something lame like that!”. Even Gurren Lagann’s mascot (a mole named Boota that’s obsessed with Yoko’s, um, guns) has a Hall-of-Fame scene (It’s in episode 25, where the show reveals that Boota is a source of what is known as “Spiral Power”). As for the aforementioned Yoko, she’s a fairly predictable character who has the Kiss of Death and who occasionally proves her statement in episode 4 (“I have my moments”) with a handful of cool scenes (highlighted by her “Class Dismissed” moment in episode 21) but she never really breaks out of her role as the cliché tsundere/fan-service tool. Despite Yoko being a member of this show’s cast, that doesn’t prevent me from hailing Gurren Lagann’s collection of characters as among anime’s finest. \n	Like practically every other action series, Gurren Lagann’s soundtrack consists of mostly fast-paced rock; every now and then , it explores other genres of music to complement the mood of the show, like jazz, folk blues, and even opera-style hip-hop (Yes, such a thing exists). Featured in Lagann’s soundtrack are some truly unforgettable songs, like the remixed version of “Row Row Fight the Power” that pops up when Kittan fights Rossiu (just a marvelous display of atmospheric techno-rap) and (my favorite) “Happily Ever After”. It’s a Japanese rock track that plays during Simon’s speech in episode 11, a song overflowing with passion, emotion, and (above all) anger. This anime wouldn’t be what it is without its soundtrack.\n	As much as I love the characters and soundtrack, I have to admit that the animation and the massive amount of style used in the animation is what really separates Gurren Lagann from the rest. In the latter part of the series, there’s a seven-year timeskip; Gurren Lagann adjusts to this by modifying the character designs (specifically Simon and Nia) to look different but not to the point of being unrecognizable. Without a doubt, the most interesting character design belongs to a warrior of the Anti-Spiral race; it’s a black-and-white outline of a body with dark, grainy images quickly flashing across the character’s skin. Among the best instances of this show’s animation are the combining scenes (the scenes where the head of a robot merges with the body to create the titular robot of the series), in which the transformation occurs with rainbow streaks coloring the background. Every now and then, Gurren Lagann uses what is known as “scenery porn”; for example, in episode 21, the show has Yoko and a schoolboy sitting in a tree, conveniently placed smack in the middle of an orange-pink afternoon sun on the left and a beautiful baby blue moon on the right. This show’s simply awe-inspiring animation is the icing on the cake that is Gurren Lagann.\n	 Like FLCL, Gurren Lagann operates with a zany, over-the-top atmosphere. The difference between the two, however, lies in Lagann steadily increasing its amount of absurdity until this exaggerated nonsense climaxes in the beginning o episode 24 with a statement made by Attenborough, the trigger-happy member of Simon’s crew:\n“THERE’S A GIANT NAKED WOMAN FLOATING IN SPACE!”\n	Knowing Gurren Lagann, of course there is. Despite its overly excessive silliness, there are also subtle elements here that help refine this series. There are a couple of moments in episode 11 that are used to address the controversial issue of sexism. There is an underrated sequence in episode 13, where the Lagann robot uses drills to swing over, beneath, and through enemies like an 8-foot tall Spiderman. There are occasional religious references that pop up in the show (Gurren Lagann doesn’t bombard you with them like other titles do) and these give the series a sense of intelligent writing. After the seven-year timeskip, there’s an underlying conflict between Simon, who longs for how things used to be, and Rossiu, who represents the New Age method of operating. The smooth blend of subtlety and silliness doesn’t appear in your average anime title.\n	Gurren Lagann is among my favorite series ever but there are several faults that prevent this from becoming the greatest of the greats. The supporting characters (like the Spiral King’s Four Supreme Generals and the aforementioned Attenborough, for example) are practically walking clichés that receive near-nonexistent depth. There’s way too much fanserivce her for my tastes (Lagann has two different episodes dedicated to the form of shameless pandering (episodes 6 and 12) but episode 12 doesn’t have the bizarre randomness that episode 6 has not the uniqueness or the massive amount of classic scenes, and is ultimately unnecessary. After the seven-year timeskip, Gurren Lagann transforms from a fun-filled adventure with a free-flowing structure to a high-stakes galactic odyssey of epic proportions with a rigid, unyielding purpose. The last seven episodes are where the series peaks in practically every respect but it loses the eccentric, carefree charm that it once possessed. Last but not least, the entire “animals-evolving-into-humans” concept is more than a little farfetched. Despite its flaws, this is a series that places a ridiculous amount of passion into everything it does, that is simply phenomenal by any statistical calculation (It even passes the Bechdel Test with flying colors, and that doesn’t happen often with anime titles), that has among the greatest recap episodes ever (Episode 16 overflows with animation style and replays the series’ classic moments up to that point), and that pushes itself to obliterate the boundaries it has already shattered before (climaxing in the final battle, which in itself is a visual and musical masterpiece). If you decide to check out the experience that is Gurren Lagann, watch it for the theme song. Watch it for Simon’s Speech in episode 11. Watch it for the immortal soundtrack. Watch it for the over-the-top silliness of it all. Above all else, watch it for Kamina.\n“There’s nobody else like him,” – Yoko Littner (Episode 8)\n	To describe the great Kamina as “unique” or “one-of-a-kind” would be a massive understatement, a feeble attempt at hero worship that doesn’t do justice in capturing the essence of this iconic legend in mere words. I (and practically every human being who’s ever existed) am not talented enough to create an analysis of this one-man force of personality but I will try my best. Who is Kamina? With one of his first lines ever (“Call me bro”), he’s introduced as the older brother Simon never had, the easygoing, optimistic slacker with a heart of gold. As Simon hangs around this charming guy, the show reveals other aspects of Kamina’s being. Confidence oozes from the pores of this man’s skin. Kamina’s every word exudes charisma. Simply put, Kamina’s the leader of leaders (You could imagine that if he were a real person, he would dominate the 2016 USA Presidential Elections). Beyond that, Kamina is a fiery fighter in battle that prides himself in his ability to, in his own words, “never give up, never surrender, [and] never back down.” Among my favorite things about this guy is how he uses his blue hair, his goofy V-shaped sunglasses, and his cheesy speeches (you know, traits that would earn ridicule for anybody else), and proudly displays them to further cement his legend, making these things actually cool. Kamina is what Aaron McGruder’s The Boondocks would dub “a booty warrior”, a man driven near-insane in the pursuit of the opposite sex (This pursuit is what he glorifies as “the very essence of a male’s soul”). Kamina is, in other words, a pervert. What truly separates our blue-haired warrior from the rest of anime’s finest is how he performs the unbelievable, the superhuman feats that only he can do, as if it’s routine, like the Spinning Sword sequence in episode 1 (Kamina stomps on a katana lying on the ground. The katana soars in the air, and quickly rotates around his neck before he grabs it in-motion), the “Fighting Spirit” scene in episode 7 (where he restores a critically-damaged Lagann with only his mental willpower), and the surreal scene in episode 4, where he makes one of his signature speeches as an opponent exclaims “Wow! That guy’s awesome!” That’s the one thing that stands out most about Kamina: no other anime character is glorified by the cast members like this guy. Kamina’s crew worships the ground he walks on. Every woman who encounters this charismatic character falls in love with him (No lie). Even Kamina’s worst enemies hold him in high regard. Later in the series, the other characters build a magnificent city in his name (the ultimate testament to Kamina’s influence and importance to Gurren Lagann). One of the saddest scenes in this show occurs when the citizens of Kamina City burn down a statue of their hero. After subpar roles in Dragon Ball Z and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Kyle Herbert unleashes a tour de force performance, an award-winning effort, as the great Kamina, injecting energy, confidence, and pain into his role. It is unarguable that Simon eventually surpasses his mentor by leaps and bounds in terms of accomplishments but he never had as much fun in what he did like Kamina. Every episode, every silly speech, every minute, every second with Kamina is a bonafide guarantee of gloriously over-the-top entertainment. Beyond that, no other character in Gurren Lagann contained his unyielding stubbornness, his uncontrollable sorrow, his cheesy sports announcer voice, his phenomenal devotion to his legion of followers, his ceaseless quest for the spectacular in every he did, his instincts-first approach to life, and (above all else) his selflessness, how he used his larger-than-life personality to set himself apart from the others. Kamina epitomizes the essence of Gurren Lagann and, as far as anime characters are concerned, he is the epitome of epitome."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the anime that made me realize that anime can be just as interesting, fun, and impactful as any live-action form of media . Every single thing about TTGL is perfect, but three things that should stand out to anybody are it's plot, characters, and overall message.\nBEWARE OF MILD SPOILERS\nPLOT\nWhile it may start out as slightly traditional mecha anime, TTGL becomes so much more. One particular episode in the first half of the series (I won't specify which, but you'll know it when you see it) is one of the most incredible pieces of action and storytelling I have ever seen.\n          \n        It shifts the story in such a surprising and believable way, I still can't find the words to describe it. Don't let me dissuade you in believing that there's nothing noteworthy afterwards, because there is so much more.\nCHARACTERS\nEvery character in TTGL bring something unique and enjoyable to the table as they come into their own. Kamina's bravado and inspiration,  Yoko's belief in her comrades, Leeron's humor, Rossiu's somewhat dark practicality, and even the villain's reasoning behind his evil deeds are all masterfully executed, however there is one character who stands above all others: Simon, one of the main protagonists. His character development is one of perfection. He's also the driving force behind the message of the series.\nOVERALL MESSAGE:\nSimon represents many different things through TTGL. Loneliness, levity, a boy becoming a man, and many more, but there is one specific trait that he doesn't possess early on, but becomes the embodiment of down the road, and that is his belief in himself and others. TTGL continually enforces that you should always believe in yourself. A few characters in the series struggle with self doubt at one point or another, but seeing them overcome it is incredibly gratifying every time. The reason the characters in TTGL can continue to push forward no matter the odds is because they believe in themselves and each other. This is an ideal that more people need to reinforce. As someone who struggled with self esteem for a long time, I saw that TTGL displays a very deep and accurate understanding of how tough it is to feel like you have no potential, and also portrays how much more you can do if you believe in yourself. \nTo summarize, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is an insanely amazing action anime, and a incredibly strong, human story that tells it's audience to believe in themselves, and to always push forward.\n        "},

One of the great amines I have seen because of its energy that flows throughout the episodes. . I&lsquo;ve seen Gankutsuou, Romeo X Juliet, FMA, FMP (all of it), Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Ef memories, FSN, DN, and others.  None of these anime have the same power to hit me as TTGL. This show isn&rsquo;t perfect, but then again nothing is. I hope this anime will drill into your heart as it did with me, then you too will be cheering with everyone around the world, Row Row Fight DA\n          \n        Power!!!!!! And if it doesn&rsquo;t, well then you can just suck it :P. \nStory: 9 The story was simple and yet so great due the music and the characters.  Simon has a wall in front of him being told its unbreakable, chances are 0%. He, however, has an adopted older brother, Kamina The Great, who gives Simon the will power to do the impossible. Don&rsquo;t wanna spoil it for you! By now you should have watched it!\nThe way I see it, you can watch it several ways.  Kind of like eating an orange. There are many ways you can eat it. You can eat the whole orange or you can peel it and its sweet center. \nOption A: Watch all of it. ISBIO (it should be intuitively obvious) -_-. \nOption B: Watch 1,2,3,7,8,9,10,11, 14, 15, 16-27. This is pretty much the heart of the anime. This option is like the spark notes version. I did the peeling for you ;).\nOption C: Watch it backwards :D. I don&rsquo;t know. Its your choice on how you like to watch anime.\nI would highly recommend option A, but if for some reason don&rsquo;t have time. Option B would be second. \nAnimation:8 To be honest, some of the scenes look like scribbles. It is a pretty decent animation better than my stick figures :D. The vibrant colors and scenery in some episodes are astounding.\nSound: 10 As I am writing this review, I am listening to &ldquo;Libera Me&rdquo; From Hell from the TTGL OST soundtrack . The music was well thought out and gave additional energy and spirit to the scenes.  It would be impossible to watch without it.\nCharacter :10. The most important reason that makes this anime so awesome. The characters are shway with their gravity defying sun glasses ;).  Sympathy for the characters run though a lot in my mind for being the underdog and learn to understand what the higher power&rsquo;s reasoning. The first episode lured me with Simon and Kamina. Both complement each other. Kamina is a god with his alluring red sun glasses and his diction. \nEnjoyment: 10. This anime was thrill ride for me. I don&rsquo;t see any reason not to enjoy it. It has a  high replay value especially couple episodes.  \n        "},

The story was kind of simplistic it's about a hero that's going to save the world. But that doesn't mean it's bad, quite the opposite. The story paces quite well, there aren't really any fillers.\n          \n        It didn't feel like it was rushed or anything, it had enough episodes to work with. Now I will tell some about the themes of the anime. It's packed with enough fights and action, one of the best fights I've seen. It even has some funny parts even during the fights and they were quite enjoyable. Fanservice was also present, but not the annoying kind of fanservice with 24/7 panty shots. The romance in the anime was also present, but quite annoying sometimes. There was also a character in the anime that solves some problems when the characters are in trouble, but he didn't really hurt the plot whatsoever. The ending was great, it had a close or open ending depending on how you view it.\nArt:\nThe art was great it reminded me of KLK a lot. The mechas were pretty well made. Especially the main mecha. The art style was quite fitting for this anime. I think it portrays the view of the author well, it fits well with the epic fights in the anime. The animation was fluid and the style didn't change throughout the show. The backgrounds weren't really breathtaking. They were pretty well drawn during the last few episodes. \nLet's talking about character designs. I really liked how the author portrayed Kamina with his signature cape, shades and his swords. It matched Kamina's personality quite well, he is also kind of wild and not tameable. He is one of the manliest anime character I've ever seen. \nThe author also gave Simon some yellow shades and it fits and protects him well during his digging. It fits his shy and cowardice personality well.\nYoko was quite voluptuous she had her signature weapon and surprise surprise her shades.\nSound:\nNot much to say about the sound. The OP/ED/OST songs are great, I still listen to them every day. You really feel the emotion when you listen to the opening song it wants to make you kick some ass and it fits quite well with the anime. The background music and the transition music are also well chosen. It even has some English songs.\nCharacter:\nThe character growth is great in the anime one of the best I've seen. When you see the shy main character crawl out of his shell and become a man. You will feel the manliness. The characters were well-rounded the important characters all had flaws and strengths, they weren't blatantly overpowered.\nViral was the foil character in the anime. He is quite the opposite of Kamina and Simon and brings their strengths to the surface. The show had a narrator and when you find out who he is, it's a nice bonus to the story. There were many side characters and they added a nice warm feeling to the anime of having a big and cozy family.\nEnjoyment:\nOne of the best shows I've seen. Even if you aren't a big anime fan you will like this. I enjoyed it a lot. I still think of it every single day. I won't forget it. It left a big impact on me. I will definitely re-watch this anime in the future.\nI definitely recommend anyone to watch this anime you will not regret it.\n"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=23,   ["text"]="                          \n    \"Reject common sense to make the impossible possible!\"\nThat's a quote from an iconic character called Kamina in the opening episode of \"Gurren Lagann\" (or \"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\" to give it its full, grand title) that sums the series up pretty well. It's a philosophy that's not only followed religiously by the characters in \"Gurren Lagann\", but by the anime itself, because \"Gurren Lagann\" is an anime that truly rejects common sense. The series has Gainax's fingerprints all over it - it's loud, rife with phallic symbols, and completely bonkers in a way that's reminiscent of other Gainax productions such as \"FLCL\". And I'll be\n          \n        honest here: I'm NOT a fan of Gainax to say the least, and this offering from them appeared to represent not only everything I dislike about the studio, but just about everything I dislike about anime in general. I didn't like its over the top, nonsensical style; I didn't like its shameless fanservice; and I didn't like its very random, slapstick humour to name just a few things. I can usually tell from the first couple of episodes whether I'm going to like an anime or not, and though there've been a handful of anime along the way that have pleasantly surprised me, my first impressions are very rarely proved wrong. And from the opening episode, I was convinced that \"Gurren Lagann\" is gonna turn out to be another piece of overrated crap that I'll absolutely loathe.\nI'll admit I was wrong.\nIt took until episode 8 for things to click. Before episode 8, \"Gurren Lagann\" had the odd moment of genius (the first time the mechas combined in the anime is outrageously funny), but it never really captured my interest. Episode 8 made me sit up and pay attention though, as some very interesting and unexpected developments in the story unfolded. I suddenly became intrigued as to which direction the anime is headed in, and from then on it seemed like \"Gurren Lagann\" had suddenly become good, though I suspect it's more of a case of me being able to see it in a different light. In my eyes, all the craziness had suddenly become brilliant, self-parodying improvisations, and beneath the craziness, meaningful themes and great character developments began to materialise. It may give the impression of being very superficial most of the time, but there is far more to \"Gurren Lagann\" than what first meets the eye. Though most of the cast are pretty one dimensional (but it gets away with this by giving the appearance of not attempting to go for any kind of depth), there are some fantastic characters in there who are not only interesting, but are also extremely well fleshed out and developed. In fact I would go as far as saying that one of the characters Simon undergoes some of the finest character development I've ever come across. \nThen we have the underlying themes, the most central one of which is about showing defiance in the face of oppressive power, about shaping your own destiny, and walking the path you choose for yourself and not letting anyone get in your way. Sure it ain't exactly original. Similar themes have been done in many other anime before, but you'll rarely find one that does it as boldly and with as much panache... or one that playfully beats this message into your head as hard as \"Gurren Lagann\" does, to the extent that even a viewer as oblivious as myself is able to get it.\nWhat makes \"Gurren Lagann\" such a fascinating anime is its contradictory nature - the fact that it's simultaneously cliched AND original. It's easy to see that's it belongs in the hot blooded shounen mecha genre, with its constant, over the top power ups and \"fighting spirit wins all\" philosophy. But at the same time, it transcends the genre not by doing something completely different, but by taking the cliches to a whole new level, all the while being delightfully self aware. It parodies AND glorifies the elements of its native genre all at once. The combining mecha aspect gets applied randomly and irrationally; the increasingly overpowered super-weapons you see in other shows also exist, but in an even more exaggerated form, with tongue-in-cheek names along the lines of \"Mega Ultra Earth Shattering Giga Drill Break\"; the mecha battles that likes to casually throw out crazy shit like a parody of \"Spiderman\"; and even the endless posturing, whilst being cheesey in the extreme, is done so well that it's also undeniably cool in the extreme. The show is full of spontaneous, joyous improvisations, as though the makers were just making stuff up as they went along, and threw in whatever crazy ideas that popped into their heads, making almost no effort to filter them through common sense first. The result is, of course, a mess... but it's a very brilliant mess.\nThe freshness of the concepts of \"Gurren Lagann\" doesn't just apply to its flashy exterior, it applies to its content and storyline as well. It's difficult to go into detail about what exactly makes \"Gurren Lagann\" different and daring without revealing the numerous massive twists that goes on in the story, but it's safe to talk about some aspects of it at least, one of which is its interesting take on the whole hotblooded hero theme. While the heroes of \"Gurren Lagann\" do a lot of endless power ups like in other shounens, it's different because the show contains this \"spiral power\" concept that allows them to turn the silly abstract concept of powering up into something tangible and work it into the actual story. Here, in the crazy world of \"Gurren Lagann\", there is a proper reason why upping up your fighting spirit will get you results. Not only that, it also provides a contrast in Rossieu who, unlike the rest of the cast, appear to be living in a reality not too distant from our own. He makes rational decisions in \"Gurren Lagann\", the kind of difficult decisions that reminds me of those from the remade \"Battlestar Galactica\" TV series. In almost any other show, these would be tough decisions very well made, but \"Gurren Lagann\" pointedly makes it clear that they are the wrong decisions within its surreal universe - it's basically issuing a forceful statement justifying it's brawn over brain storyline by saying \"look - the rational approach just doesn't work here!\" It's this kind of self awareness and cheeky way of justifying the usual cliches that distinguishes it from your run of the mill shounen.\nIt's obvious that \"Gurren Lagann\" is an extremely audacious project, and it's easy for these kind of projects to become a victim of its own vast ambitions, because it takes something damn special to pull off this kind of stunt. Although \"Gurren Lagann\" undeniably manage to achieve its ambitious goals, it does not emerge unscathed from its struggles to get there.\nFor example, it sets a lofty standard for itself with its craziness and its epicness, but once it had caught my attention with that, it needed to keep doing crazy/clever/funny things to keep me interested (how ironic, given that initially I detested the series for these same qualities), and it's something that's hard to sustain through the length of the whole series. Inevitably, during the episodes where it fails to meet it's own standards for craziness etc, \"Gurren Lagann\" can feel a little flat. I feel that, while watching some of the episodes mid series, my interest in the show was still being fueled by that sublime arc that started around episode 8 rather than interest generated by the new episodes. These episodes, in along with those that feel like they're just about keeping it together simply by piling on more twists, just don't feel solid enough. Also, while the fanservice of \"Gurren Lagann\" often comes off as parodying (especially in the hilarious episode 5), it does sometimes also feel gratuitous and excessive.\nComplacency is a not a word that exists in this anime's dictionary - it's a show that rarely stays still. It's constantly skipping from location to location, timeline to timeline, and even universe to universe. However, I sometimes had trouble getting to grips with the events that were happening because the show moved *too* quickly in places. Perhaps trying so hard to keep the viewer on their toes as much as possible resulted in \"Gurren Lagann\" relying too much on unexpected twists and not enough on solid execution - sometimes it feels like the twists just didn't have a good enough foundation to work from. One example of this is Rossieu's character \"change\" after one of the time skips. It's a change that I initially found to be less than convincing. A few episodes later though, and it all started to make sense, and thinking back on it, I concluded that it probably seemed a little jarring at first because Rossieu is a character that barely featured before that time skip - it's not that he undergoes some sudden, unrealistic change in personality, it's just that we didn't get much of a chance to understand his character before the time skip.\nBut ultimately, \"Gurren Lagann\" hits the mark much more than it misses it, and it's freshness and adventurous approach does more than enough to allow it to stand out from the crowd. While I'm not about go crazy and declare it as the greatest anime ever, it surprised me not only because it made me tear up my initial assessment of it, but also in the WAY it managed to do this. Other anime that won me over after a bad initial impressions did so by tranforming itself completely (for example \"Kimi ga Nozomu Eien\") or by gradually building up momentum and increasing in quality (for example \"Beck\"), but \"Gurren Lagann\" doesn't do this - it's pretty consistent in what it's trying to do all the way through. Instead, it made me eat my words by changing ME. And from my personal point of view, managing to somehow convince a non-believer like myself to buy into its crazy philosophies is arguably \"Gurren Lagann\"'s greatest achievement. To do THAT takes something special, and \"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\" is special.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    STORY: 9\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the story of Simon, a hole-digger who has lived his whole life underground. One day, he and his friend (or as they call themselves, \"brother\") Kamina encounter a giant mecha from the surface, a Gunman, and defeat it with Yoko, a girl who also lives on the surface. The three boys and other allies will go on a quest to save the humans from the tiranny of Lordgenome, the Spiral King who forces men to live underground. This is the story of the first part of the series, but from episode 15 onwards GL changes COMPLETELY and develops in\n          \n        ways you don't expect. Though the story in its entirety is not abslutely original (it's the \"\"\"\"usual\"\"\"\" struggle against a menace to humanity... more than once, in fact) this developement and the sheer amount of epicness which drives it is the thing that makes GL shine in this department. Even the \"message of the spiral\" is a  typical shonen moral, but it's delivered so effectively and epically that it will not fail to impress you.\nART: 8\nThe mecha design is splendid, when not downright CRAZY in a beautiful way (those who have seen the last episodes will know what I mean). Mechas are varied, great to watch and they ooze epicness from every hole, especially later on. The character design is less peculiar, but memorable as well (how can you not enjoy the... ehr, graphical qualities of a character like Yoko? But boobs aside, I mean it), somewhat simple and effective both in serious moments and in comedy. As far as the environments go, it's not all good because we mostly see desolated portions of the earth, a technological city and space. Nothing that special, but not that it really matters, I'm just being hypercritical here. The animation is really good overall, fluid and smooth but most of all CLEAR. The battles are graphically a mess most of the times, but you can perfectly make out the details. Unfortunately there are a couple of REALLY subpar episodes from this POV.\nSOUND: 8\nThis would be a 7 normally, because the songs are good to listen while watching the action but not on the level that they make you want to listen to them in other occasions... that is if we exclude the second ending theme, \"Minna no Peace\", and the awe-inducing \"Libera Me From Hell\", which is the best version of the serie's infectious rap line \"Row row fight the power\" mixed with some epic opera. Those two songs are so great they manage to elevate this category to an 8. Another contribution is due to the fitting sound effects, as well as the excellent Italian dub (I saw the serie in my native language dub).\nCHARACTER: 9\nA particularly strong point of GL. The cast is awesome, with characters full of charisma (to name a few: Simon, Kamina, Nia, Viral, Lordgenome...) and capable of making you empathyze with them. Their stories and resolution are one of the main things that keep the story going. One could object that they are largely one-dimensional (few characters like Simon, Viral, Lordgenome and Kittan do really progress from their first appearance in terms of personality), but truthfully the creators focus JUST on the right characters to develop, while the others still retain charisma through the corality of the cast, not to mention that nearly everyone of them has something epic to do or say in the serie. Last but not least, they made a final villain who is cold and personality-less for plot reason awesome as well, how the hell did they do that?\nENJOYMENT: 10\nI am not gonna lie about this: GL is a serie that you could see in one day due to how hookind and entertaining it is. You start with little, but as the episodes progress it becomes more and more epic, and by the end of part 1 you are thinking \"That's it, they cannot top this epicness\". But they do, and they do it AGAIN and AGAIN up to the serie's finale. It's like a giant matrioska of epicness in which you start from the small one and then witness dolls bigger and bigger. This way, you are increasingly eager to continue the more you progress. This is largely due to the cast, but also to the battle themselves, with dozen of ridiculously large, powerful and/or memorable mechas and villains: by the end of the serie you will be screaming with excitement like you probably did as a young kid when watching Dragon Ball or Saint Seiya. There are a couple of dull episodes along the way, one being a recap of what happened before, but you won't even notice as you will be pushed forward by the massive momentum that the serie has, bigger and bigger until the end.\nAll-in-all TTGL is an awesome serie that everyone should watch, wether you like mechas or not. Technically superb, well written and epic with an awesome cast, the work is a must watch for every anime fan. It has some flaws if you really want to find them, so I can't give the serie a totally perfect score, but it's very close to perfection. At the moment, at the second place of the most beautiful anime I've ever seen. If you haven't, go. NOW.\n        "},

It's not about a logical progression, strategy, conflicts of interests, world building, or even a minimum knowledge of socioeconomic relationships. I usually like smart animes.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Watching Gurren Lagann is a very unique experience that doesn't come along too often.\nYou first find yourself in a very simple world with a seemingly average protagonist until you're suddenly swept away into something larger than life. You're introduced to a large variety of characters from the strong yet vulnerable Yoko, to the energetic and inspiring Kamina, and finally to the hero of our story: the seemingly weak and cowardly Simon who turns out to be so much more than you initially expect.\nThe story of Gurren Lagann is completely ridiculous at first glance but it also holds some emotional depth to it. Like most Gainax\n          \n        series it's a story about growing up at its core ,and I feel like this is one of their best attempts at it. You watch these characters face multiple hardships and find themselves in hopeless situations, but they always keep fighting against destiny and it's honestly inspiring to watch. And maybe I'm giving the story too much credit because as I said, the actual plot is completely ridiculous and doesn't take itself seriously. One of the reoccurring themes in the show is even \"Kick logic to the curb and do the impossible\", but it's that whole \"Do the impossible\" aspect of the series grabbed me hard and has never let go. It's definitely a series that needs to be watched with the heart and not the head in order to fully enjoy it.\nThe animation in Gurren Lagann ranges from really great to painfully noticeable that the budget ran out (i.e. episode 4), but most of the time it is very excellent, especially in the last few episodes which are absolutely gorgeous. The art style is fun and completely over the top and it definitely works well for a series like this one.\nGurren Lagann is honestly enjoyable whether you choose to watch the dub or sub. Both feature solid casts who slip into their roles nicely. However, I am more partial to the sub because I feel like there's a really passionate energy there that I don't think the dub cast quite managed to capture, especially Kyle Hebert as Kamina, but it is still an excellent dub. I also have to give a mention to Yuri Lowenthal's portrayal of Simon's growth throughout the show because it is a truly fantastic performance. The music is one of my favorite things about the series with a killer OST that mixes rap, opera, and orchestral pieces that help to intensify the more serious moments and more often than that, get you hyped up for the battles as they play behind one of the many over the top and uplifting speeches of the show.\nThe characters are hands down the strongest part of Gurren Lagann, delving into some of the best character development I've seen in a long time especially with Simon. It's not afraid to touch on the weaknesses of humans and work to overcome those weaknesses. A lot of series have a problem of backtracking after a character has already developed, but Gurren Lagann still pushes forward, continuing to still exploit weaknesses, but never backtracking. Each character is unique in their own way and they're all memorable. It's a really fun and varied cast that is easy to develop a connection with.\nOverall, Gurren Lagann is a really enjoyable series if you can watch it without thinking about it too logically. It's definitely not going to be the type of show for everybody, and despite its flaws and silliness, it's personally my favorite anime. There's a passion about Gurren Lagann that I had never seen before and never seen since. You can tell that everybody who worked on this series really loved it and put their all into it and that passion definitely shines though in every aspect. It may not be the most serious show but if you can get into it then I feel like you can really take something out of it.\n\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=21,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    To preface this, it has been a few months since I've last seen this anime, though I have seen it twice.\nThis anime is my personal favorite, I'll say that up front. Though I can't seem to think of any part of this show that was top notch (Though everything about it was at least good), it is definitely more than the sum of its parts, and it is by and large the most enjoyable anime I have ever seen. I mentioned that I watched it twice, which, for me, is saying something, as I tend to not re-watch series unless I truly loved them, yet\n          \n        I can see myself re-watching this show several more times in the future.\nHowever, before I speak on anything specific about the show, I will say that it is VERY important to be open-minded with this anime. This show is, above all else, loud, goofy, and stupid. If you are someone who cannot \"turn their brain off\" when it comes to watching anime, this show is likely not for you, as you pretty much need to do so in order to enjoy this show. Explanations for things (Such as Spiral Energy in general) are pretty dumb when taken a closer look at, as are most all of the sci-fi aspects of the show. But if you are able to get past the rather high suspension of disbelief, you'll find a series that has so much heart and embraces its own stupidity so completely that it is simply impossible to not enjoy on some level.\nI would actually say that the weakest part of this show is its story, though, as I said, it is still good. Save one significant event early on, which I will refrain from mentioning, it never really throws any curve-balls at you, though I will admit, the ending was surprisingly touching and rather sad. Still, everything in between was decent enough, with no moments story wise that really stood out as being particularly bad in any way. Though there are many moments that may seem rather deus exa machina-ey, they never really stand out as they seem to fit with the silly and over the top theme of the show.\nThe art is rather consistent throughout, and while nothing stood out to me as all that impressive, it was overall very good. It boasts many varied and memorable character designs and decent use of lighting to accentuate the more serious scenes. However, I will still only rate it \"good\" for one thing in particular…episode 4. From what I understand, there was a guest director for this episode, Osamu Kobayashi. While he has worked on another one of my favorite anime, Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad, along with others, his style is much…well, I'm not expert in art myself, but the term I would use would be \"sketchier\", if that makes sense. The point being, it doesn't match the rest of the episodes, though it is still good, the only difference being the art style, not the quality. However, given how he only directed one episode, it messes with the consistency of the shows animation overall.\nThe sound in this show is rather spectacular. Special shout-out to Kyle Hebert, the voice of the iconic Kamina, for his particularly wonderful voice acting. It takes a special kind of voice actor to make the many idiotic and ridiculously \"manly\" monologues of Kamina sound sincere and entertaining without being too stupid sounding, and Hebert obviously does a great job of it. The rest of the voice cast all had great performances as well, with no real weak links among them. The music is also equally great, the opening theme getting you sufficiently pumped for the episode to come along with decent background music throughout. Also, I don't care what your stance is on rap music, I defy anyone to not have the line \"Row, Row, Fight Da Powah!\" stuck in your head for WEEKS after watching this show.\nThe characters are a big part of what makes this show as great as it is is the characters. From Simon's emotional journey into manhood, the bombastic manliness and stupidity of Kamina, to the badassness and likability of Yoko, and everyone in between, this cast is memorable and lovable from beginning to end. Despite the silliness of what is happening, you find yourself really caring for these characters and wishing them to succeed, enjoying their antics all the while.\nIn the end, what makes this show great is how wonderfully all of the elements come together. With the over the top story, extremely energetic characters and music, and art that reflects both the silly, serious, and just badass moments equally well, this show is definitely a masterpiece by sheer enjoyability alone. With moments that will tug at your heart strings, characters that never cease to entertain, and lines that will be engrained in your memory for years to come, this show is a blast from beginning to end, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=20,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This is my first attempt at a review here on MAL. I'm going to try and not make this review biased. \nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann can simply be described as the best anime that has been released ever. As Biased as it may sound, I cannot find anything wrong with anime at all.\nThe first episode of the anime does not really compare to the other episodes of the anime. Most of time in anime, you may or may not notice that it has it's ups and downs. In TTGL, there really isn't anything like that. One by one, Each and every episode builds up more\n          \n        action and fury.\nThe storyline for TTGL is definetly my favorite part of the anime. Everything in the storyline makes sense, there are no plot holes, and everything follows a sequential order. There aren't many flash backs which is also a plus. As the anime goes on, the main characters keep becoming more and more powerful. There isn't a single instance during the anime where a main character loses hope or loses faith in themselves. There however is one instance during the anime that really catches everyone by surprise. The event that took place was for the better though. It motivated the characters to push forward\nYou may think that the artwork is cartoony... but I say it does the anime wonders. I can't imagine TTGL in an animation style made by someone like madhouse.. it just compliments it perfectly. You may think it make the anime all cheery and bubbly, well there are plenty of bloody scenes and graphic depictions. One of my favorite parts was how some of the scenes looked hand drawn. There would be seriously high points during the show where the view would zoom in on a characters face that looked manga-ized while they were screaming or yelling. It just complimented the anime so well.\nThe sound. Very often you watch an anime and notice repeat sound effects and dialog. There is hardly any of that in TTGL. TTGL was broad casted in HD and the sound that is linked with it compliments it greatly. From the explosive action to the perfect timing with background music. There are a few times when the intro music starts playing and pumps up the hype for what is about to happen as well. \nThe Characters are epic. Maybe not my favorite part of the anime, however they are the best part of it. Half of the characters carry the cure for being emo. You simply watch them and you have to cheer them on while watching. They all play amazing roles in the anime. None of the characters are boring and they all kept me interested. I cannot see how anyone watching TTGL can grow to dislike any of the characters. \nEnjoyment? This anime made me cheer at my computer and yell at high levels. As I said before, this anime can turn any emotionally upset person into a motivated hyperactive nusicance. \nOverall? \n10/10\nIf I could rate it as high as I wanted it to be.. it would be 9000/1\nFrom the artwork, to the sound, to the characters... there is absouletly nothing wrong with this anime.\n        "},

After watching it I did not feel as though my time had been wasted, or would have been better spent watching some other anime.  However, there were a few things I took issue with that had me a bit disappointed after hearing the stellar reviews.\nThe characters themselves are all very charming. Kamina serves as a great motivator--not only for the other characters in the anime, but for the viewers as well. Simon's struggles with self-doubt early on are very believable, and has you rooting for him all the\n          \n        way. Much to the credit of the show, the characters and their personalities are not stagnant, and you see a lot of growth throughout. Simon fills into his role as pilot of Lagan rather nicely, as opposed to being cursed with self-doubt for its entirety. After all, who wants to see some punk who never has any confidence in himself, despite getting plenty of experience?\nI will say, however, that it is rather frustrating the way everything always \"works out.\" The cast constantly faces new, and more difficult struggles, but you can hardly appreciate it considering there is always some \"ace-in-the-hole\" they're sure to pull out along the way. At first it is rather exciting, but by the end of the anime it gets a bit frustrating, and you have to wonder if they'll ever reach the bottom of their hat tricks. I fully understand that the whole point of the anime is centered around evolution, but it's not much fun if the characters always have something new up their sleeves without even having to try.\nNot to mention the mechas (or Ganmen) themselves are constantly conveniently upgraded. After being suppressed underground so long, how can they so easily integrate new technologies? It hit a bit of a sore spot with me, as it was just one more thing that came a little too easily in the show.\nThe artwork itself was refreshing. The Ganmen themselves were very unique, drawn not in the usual, run-of-the-mill way seen in so many other mecha anime. At first I wasn't sure how I felt about that, but in the end they won my heart over by taking a step away from the usual. Yoko is, of course, gorgeous to look at, but the viewer isn't hit with so much fanservice it's disgusting. Simon's design evolves along with his character--using a more childish design at first to emphasize his naivity and lack of confidence, but then giving him a much stronger look later on to better suit his leadership position.\nOverall, I would say Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagan was an enjoyable watch. I probably won't be recommending it to any of my friends as a \"must see,\" but I certainly wouldn't dissuade anyone from seeing it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I’m not sure how it does it, but Gurren Lagann manages to be one of the most perfect anime I have ever seen. It knows what it wants to be, what it wants to do, and then it just does it. In all fairness, it’s not totally perfect, but I don’t think there is an anime that is totally perfect. Still, Gurren Lagann’s flaws are few to none. \nWhile I normally start with characters and story, I’m going to flip flop and discuss the technicalities. Gurren Lagann is one of only two anime that I have given 10/10 for both animation and sound at this\n          \n        point. The soundtrack pulls off this unique blend of techno, hip-hop and soft core metal that fits perfectly. And that’s only the soundtrack. The flair of the sound effects used in action sequences can make the viewer feel like they’re watching Dragon Ball Z all over again. Still, Gurren Lagann would not be able to achieve its insane magnitude without the stellar visuals. Just when you think the animation can’t take it any further, it does, and it does it over and over again every single episode.\nI’ve said it before that no matter how stellar an anime can be technically, it can never make a bad anime good (but if there was anime like that, it would be Gurren Lagann). In its own way, the story of Gurren Lagann is a work of pure genius. Now, I came into the show with quite a few misconceptions. While I was sure it was good, I thought I was going to see an anime with a story comprised of mostly gags and mindless nonsense. This could not be farther from the truth. I’ve heard the word “stu-ffective” thrown around to describe Gurren Lagann, since it is apparently both “stupid,” but also “effective.” Gurren Lagann is smart. Gurren Lagann is dark. Gurren Lagann takes every precognition you develop for it, and burns it up. \nThe initial plot of Gurren Lagann is equivalent to what people would expect. It starts as what could be considered a typical action/adventure anime. I won’t discuss the actual plot much because that’s what the synopsis in myanimelist is for. What unfolds is our main characters embarking on a quest to destroy the mechas known as “gunman” that threaten humanity. After discussing some of the characters, I will elaborate on the plot further.\nOut of the main cast, the most important character is Simon (Yes, Simon is more important than Kamina). In the very beginning, Simon seems kind of underwhelming. Simon tends to take the backseat behind Kamina and Yoko, who are main characters that come off to be much more interesting. Kamina, who is the fan favorite of the cast, is a total boss from the get go. His actions and words are inspiring, and his fire fuels the early episodes of Gurren Lagann. Yoko is a sly badass that provides plenty of cleavage for the male fan base. Between the two, how could Simon succeed? Well, Simon is perhaps the most dynamic main character I’ve seen since Tomoya Okazaki. Going into detail would reveal spoilers, but there is a great coming of age story in Gurren Lagann.\nThere is a very climactic point around half way through the series where the brilliance of Gurren Lagann starts to shine. Characters that only really showed one side for the majority of the series become deeper than what one would expect. The reason why this is possible of course is that the plot of Gurren Lagann gets deeper. I wish I could tell you exactly how Gurren Lagann does it, but you just have to see it to believe it. Simply put, new themes are brought in the mix. Family. Government. Love. What surprised me the most was how many characters that didn’t seem too important suddenly become crucial to the story. Like many other anime, Gurren Lagann takes a couple episodes that aren’t directly related to the plot for the purpose increasing the cast size. Down the line, these episodes feel crucial.\nMy only real criticism for Gurren Lagann is in the character department. I did just say that a lot of not so important characters really shine in the latter portion of the show. Well, at the same time, there are a lot of characters that don’t go through such a metamorphosis. Now you might think, “Well, obviously Gurren Lagann can’t do that for every single character.” That is true. But you see, there are parts of the latter portion of the show where minor characters that aren’t so developed get put on the same pedestal as the main characters. It’s kind of like there are so many shoes that the story of Gurren Lagann needs to fill, and it doesn’t have quite enough meaningful characters to fill them with. This is a very small and forgivable problem, but it did bother me some, and it would be wrong not to include it in my review. The second part of that criticism would be that before some of the characters feel really meaningful in the latter portion of the show, they didn’t feel very meaningful in the early portion of the show.\nAfter finishing my criticisms for Gurren Lagann, I think it’s time to talk about another thing I like about it. Now, every anime takes a while to get going. Steins;Gate takes 9-12 episodes to get to its best, and that’s half of the series. The original Full Metal Alchemist is often heckled for its filler episodes that are only a means of preventing the anime from catching up to the manga. Heck, Hunter x Hunter spends two whole arcs to get to where it needs to be. The first three episodes of Gurren Lagann are great. Four, five and six aren’t that great in my opinion. After that, every single episode manages to be better than the last one. You get through less than a quarter of the way through, and the rest of Gurren Lagann is upwards and onwards. For an anime that is 27 episodes, this is quite the feat.  \nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is an incredible anime that has managed to once again raise my standards for a masterpiece. It manages to consistently grow into a story that is as good as they come, while always being a huge spectacle to watch. Any fan of anime should give it a watch, and many will see is it as a masterpiece as I do.  \n"},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=19,   ["text"]="\n                          \n     Gurren Lagann in a few words can be described as the single most large scale revolution ever put on paper. \nThe Story \nis about a child named Simon and his hero Kamina who are both forced to live in a underground City gaurded by giant robots called Gunmen. Kamina dreams of flying to the skies  while Simon like most kids is terrified of trying anything so daring. For some reasons on this planet human beings are not allowed to reach the surface, and if they do so, they are usually crushed by these monstrous Gunmen robots. So through the use of fear and\n          \n        power, the Gunmen imprison humans underground, so naturally rebellious humans ban together to revolt against these tyrannical monsters. Kamina and Simon eventually meet one of these rebels known as Yoko and begin a long revolution against the king of Gunmen, the stars, and even God himself.\nCharacters \nThis is where I had a huge problem, all the characters lacked development in my opinion. Not one of them was interesting, and the one entertaining personality Kamina was killed off early, so the rest of the show  you have to  put up with a wining baby named Simon as the main protagonist. One good thing about this show is the time skip where Simon and his friends grow up, the bad thing is no one becomes interesting over the time skip. Another annoying aspect of the show is when you know the good guys have the clear cut advantage over the other side, what is the advantage the good guys have? It happens to be this spiral like necklace which can unlock Gunmen&rsquo;s true powers. So when ever Simon finds himself in a pinch, he simply relies on his magical charm to give his gunmen infinite power to kick the enemies ass. What ever you stick this key into becomes an unstoppable fighting machine. This made the show very uninteresting since the main characters toy seemed to possess some sort of immense power that the enemies could never dream to overcome(he defeats GOD with this toy!!!) Certainly who ever possessed this spiral like necklace had a major advantage in battle thus the element of surprise is not their in this anime.\n\nOverall\nNow the story and characters may interest some people, but for some reason I was never swept away by this anime, it just felt like a huge roller-coaster that just never hit full speed.\nEvery episode had a reoccurring theme, &ldquo;Never Give up&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nothing is Impossible!!!&rdquo; or some crap like that. It felt like every episodes message was to tell viewers you can do anything as long as you BELIEVE. Something I haven&rsquo;t  heard since pre-school I might add. Another issue I had with this show was killing off the backbone of the show, Kamina. He had a colorful personality and was not the least bit dull unlike the other cast members. This anime certainly aspires to do big things, but fails at many small things. The show wasn&rsquo;t incredibly funny, dramatic or original but it did try so I would say this anime is certainly not a wannabe anime it just isn&rsquo;t something I found interesting. It felt like a show that belongs on Saturday morning cartoons on FOX. But if your into wacky mecha fighting, large scale DBZish warfare, very good animation then you should try this anime.\n"},

This is the anime to watch\nThe anime progresses very quicky but does not miss any details. This keeps the anime on going with no lag meaning it will not leave u bored 1 minute. The anime is mainly divided into two main settings. Most of the action and comedy happens in the first half of the anime however like i said, it will not get boring because in addition, the second half includes\n          \n        even greater excitment and romance too.\nStory: This story has everything, it will make you use every single slang word on the cyber world, from 'LoL'- 'Rofl'(&lt;== Litterally, falling on the floor laughing) to Tears, From 'Omg' to 'WTF' But believe me, 'Wtf' will imediately become again to LOL or ect...

I hope you would take my advice and watch it for urself, I know some of you are going wow, ewwww its mecha, wtf power rangers looking. Thats what i thought in the first place, But believe me, once you start watching it, You just entered a whole new world.\nOverall: I gave this anime a 10 overall because why?

It goes beyond conventional like and dislike, and more into primal instinct - this show is the best definition of EPIC.\nAs I finished watching it, I couldn't resist the impulse of almost ripping my shirt off - slamming the window wide open (with shirt flapping in the wind for special effect), launching myself on the roof and screaming out: \n'WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM?!'\nNeedless to say it was about 2am in the morning, half the neighbours shat themselves and I\n          \n        quickly made my escape. The police wasn't called at least.\nThe story is as good as you make of it, it's about us as humans and how we push ourselves forward despite the odds - about evolution, advance - and those out to stop us. From the start it's obvious we'll win somehow, but at what price and what consequences? It's good to see a story which isn't afraid of doing anything, if a main character has to die, they'll die. \nWe're talking about a mecha anime - of course expect detailed vehicles and over-the-top explosions which multiply spontaneously to the power of pi. Characters are drawn as detailed as they are important, expect less of a serious face on some of the side characters, replaced with a cartoony visage for the sake of some hilarity. Throughout the series it manages to keep dignity, the art direction is always stylish and fluid - a real stash of eyecandy.\nThe voice acting in this series remains above normal standards, by that I mean, for once i'm not annoyed by any single character's voice. The real part of this 10 comes from the insane soundtrack provided, adding the perfect ambience for any situation - from fighting one-on-one combat with an enemy Ganmen, to the theme song that rolls on the intro each time.\nDeveloping characters takes time, and while I think GAINAX managed to successfully develop most main characters by the end of the show- it still left questions unanswered, particularly the reasoning of the main antagonists.\n(know your enemy, sympathise with them ;) )\nSomething this show will never lack, is enjoyment. Characters you'll love, random mechas smashing each other to scrap-metal, upgrades and power-ups that never make sense, and the pace of the show. Oh sure, try and fit a conflict spanning the whole universe in 27 episodes, i dare you. But they did just that, the speed at which it pulls itself forward is never too slow, and it seems perfect.\nWhy do I give this a 10? Because I can't find any logical reason to give it anything less. If you're looking for a no nonsense anime which gets straight to the point, with a big drill. This is your kind of anime.\n        "},

Also I had three choices for my next mecha anime.\nFull Metal Panic.\nGurren Lagann.\nRahxephon.\nI decided too,,,,, go with Gurren Lagann over the other because at time people told me that the other two mecha shows were average and I pretty much avoided them until winter 16. (BTW those other two mecha shows were actually great)\nNow what do I think of Gurren Lagann? I think Gurren Lagann are a amazing over the type mecha series that I loved but I don't consider Gurren Lagann too,,,,, be a true masterpiece in my eyes unlike Wolf' Children another anime that I reviewed and I consider that a true masterpiece.\nAnime Review 0.7 Ookami Kodomo no Ame too,,,,, Yuki : Wolf Children\nWhy are that? Let's dive it shall we.\n\nStory.\n\nThe story begins with Simon and Kamina living in a underground village where are they forced too,,,,, underground as minors for life\nOne day the protagonist Kamina and Simon decided that they don't want too,,,,, spend they life's underground and start they journey in the surface where they met many allies and enemies along the way in they journey too,,,,, defeat Beastmen and later on Lordgenome the spiral king.\n\nNow Gurren Lagann are spit up into two arcs.\nThe per time-skip arc episode 1-16 and the post time-skip arc episodes 17 - 27 = end\nAm going too,,,,, say this right now I prefer the per time-skip arc over the post time-skip because besides the last couple of episodes I feel like the post time-skip arc are kinda forced in the terms of content more on that shortly.\nI feel that the per time-skip arc has better writing and better content like the first 8 episodes Kamina helps Simon too,,,,, overcome his fears and help him too,,,,, become a man and also the final two episodes of the per time-skip arc was better directed because I actually felt more engaged with the Mecha fights. Don't get me wrong I loved the finale of Gurren Lagann but too,,,,, get too,,,,, the amazing finale I had too,,,,, sit through more serious episode that were unneeded.\n\nWith that amazing story that Gurren Lagann has it also has amazing world building like for example in episode 1 we are shown life of Simon and Kamina living in a underground village as slaves while in the beginning of the post time-skip arc too,,,,, beginning state of Kamina city where Rossui are in control.\nIf I had any real complaints with the are transaction of the amazing well written per-time-skip too,,,,, the more kinda first half of the post time-skip arc because they decided too,,,,, more series and added more romance which it didn't work for the show. I feel like the serious stuff of Gurren Lagann did not work at all and also I feel that the romance of this arc was just forced in.\n\nGurren Lagann explores  themes like puberty and determination.\nYou see at the start of Gurren Lagann you see Simon as this typical pilot whom are scared too,,,,, do anything and he always had too,,,,, relay on Kamina but has the series progresses you actually see Simon grow as a character and he actually becomes a real man. The determination part of Gurren Lagann are basically where all of the character will never back down even when they are in a critical stake.\n\nOverall the story may have issues during the beginning of the post time-skip arc it makes it up with the amazing pre-timeskip arc and the last couple of episode of the post time-skip arc.\n9/10\n\nCharacters.\nThe characters of Gurren Lagann are all around great. some may say that some of the character were annoying but I personally found too,,,,, be really enjoyable.\nEnter our main lead Simon. The main plot of Gurren Lagann.\nHe starts off as a wimp where he just always run away from a fight similar too,,,,, Shinji Ikari but as the series progresses around end of the arc before the post time-skip we see him overcome his psychology issues and he actually grows up too,,,,, become a real man.\nOverall I really like Simon.\n\nKamina are manliest of the group and his very determined.\nWe get too,,,,, see Kamina as the leader of Team Dai-Gurren and he's very determined of taking down the beast-man empire with his crew.\nI personally found Kamina too,,,,, be a great character because I liked his determination and the advice that he will give usually give too,,,,, Simon too,,,,, overcome his fear.\nOverall I liked Kamina but are sad too,,,,, see him go after the first couple of episodes because something happens too,,,,, him which I wont spoil in this review\nYoko are honestly a great character in my opinion because she has great character developed through out the series like for example in episode 7 Yoko are expressing her feeling too,,,,, Kamina and throughout episode 8 she actually wants Kamina too,,,,, be safe after the battle has ended,\n\nHowever my favourite part of Yoko's character development are at episode 12 where at the beginning she doesn't trust Nia and she showed her Tsundere side of jealousy until the very end of the episode where Yoko finally trust Nia.\nI was kind worried at first when she first appeared in the shows because I thought Yoko would be a another sex object type of character that you will usually see in most ecchi/harem anime. This was not the case for Yoko because while having a amazing ass/boobs she are still a well developed character that actually are relevant too,,,,, the story.\nOverall I really like Yoko.\n\nLastly we have Nia whom  are the disowned daughter of Lordgenome.\nI personally liked her but at the same time she's rather off because she may be well developed character due too,,,,, her dealing with the truth like her father just left her too,,,,, die too,,,,, when she learns how too,,,,, socialise with humans in the per time- arc. This are something off about Nia that I notice when watching Gurren Lagann but I have too,,,,, say this.\nNia are a Eureka clone. Why? Nia shows personal traits of Eureka starting from the end of episode 12 when her long hair has been shot up and the very beginning of episode 13 her gets shorten and her appearance are literally ripped from Eureka from Eureka Seven. Not too,,,,, mention that in the post time-skip arc at times she are basically a walking Eureka even tho she has her original moments.\nOverall I enjoyed Nia as a character but not in the same way as Yoko\nThe rest of the characters did great with they roles and almost all of them are memorable for the most part.\n\nHowever out of all of the character I liked and enjoyed theyre are one character that kinda bother me especially in post-time-skip arc of the series and that are Rossiu Adai.\nI am still trying too,,,,, puzzle this because I personally found hes methods on paper too,,,,, be great but execution I found his methods too,,,,, be selfish . I wont go into more detail Rossiu methods because the things that he does are a walking spoiler itself and trust me I want you too,,,,, experience this character for yourself.\nBesides that I personally mixed opinion on Rossiu.\nOverall besides from Rossiu I found this character cast too,,,,, be great and very memorable.\n\n9.5/10\n\nAnimation/Art.\nNow the art of Gurren Lagann for the most part are visually amazing and over the top.\nThe background scenery and locations were all very well detailed for a Ganiax show. It also adds more life too,,,,, Gurren Lagann especially if youre exploring each arc of the show like in Kamina\nThe character designs are surprisingly unique because after all this a Gainax show.\nAm also surprised the amount of budget that Gurren Lagann has because all of the mecha fights were all perfectly animated hell the last episode of Gurren Lagann features the best mecha animation in all of mecha anime ^_^\n\nOne thing that I really adore about the art and animation are different art-style that it uses.\nThe per timeskip arc has the more FLCL style when it comes too,,,,, its animation while in the second half are modernise and cleaner like a adult while Simon was a kid it has a more cartoonist  feel into it\n\nHowever their are one thing that bother me and that art- style at times can like bad at times. What do I mean bad? Well episode 4 had a different director named Osamu Kobayashi whom directed that episode. The action scenes were fine but the art can range from bad too,,,,, downright ugly.\n\n\nThe last time that I want too,,,,, point are the fan- service and I personally think the fan-service was well use and it didn't distract the viewer. Episodes 6 and 12 contain some best use of fan-service I have seen in mecha anime because not only they those two episodes are self aware of the fan-service content but they also manages too,,,,, connect with they story perfectly.\n\nOverall I really adore the art/animation here for the most part.\n9.5/10\nSound.\nGurren Lagann features my favourite anime OST in anime. Some of my favourite tracks include.\n\nGurren Lagann also has my favourite anime opening of all time Soraio Days by and trust me the song itself brings more excitement for this show. While the ending themes are good but not are exciting as the opening in my opinion.\n\n\nGurren Lagann also has some of the best dubs of Mecha anime period because you can tell theyre a lot of effort in the dubbing department. I mean we have Yuri Lowenthal as Simon, Kyle Hebert as Kamina, Michelle Ruff as Yoko and  Bridget Hoffman as Nia (Older)\nGurren Lagann are one of those shows that you should watch in dub over the sub because like other anime like FMAB, Ourlaw Star, Nana, Eureka Seven, Durarara, Cowboy Bebop and Code Geass I feel the dub adds more life too,,,,, the show because dub actors are more relaxed and professional when voicing this characters of those shows.\nIn short watch Gurren Lagann dub ^_^\n\nOne more thing that I like too,,,,, add.\n Gurren Lagann features some of the best anime quotes in anime period.\n\nKamina\n\"Don't be distracted by the what-if's, should-have's, and if-only's. The one thing you choose for yourself - that are the truth of youre universe\"\n\"When we were trapped in that hole...theyre was nothing I could do. But Simon just kept on digging. Believing in my show of courage\". \"In the end, he was the one whom saved me\".\n\"Whom the hell do you think I am?!\"\n“A real man never dies, even when he's killed!” \n\nSimon\n“I will believe! I will believe in the me that believes in us, humans and the future! This drill are my soul!\"\n“We evolve, beyond the person that we were a minute before. Little by little, we advance with each turn. That's how a drill works!\n10/10\nEnjoyment.\n\nWhat can I really say about enjoyment of the gem. It's are a wonderful piece of art that I loved from start of finish expect for the beginning of the post timeskip arc. I just wasn't a fan of that arc in the beginning.\nI really love how Gainax manages too,,,,, handle they budget because the last couple of episodes has some of the best animation quality I have ever seen in fiction. Seriously the animation of the last few episodes put some anime movies too,,,,, fucking shame.\nI personally enjoyed almost every character from Simon whom grew too,,,,, a real man, Kamina while not being in the show after a certain point of the story has inspired Simon too,,,,, become the person that he are today too,,,,, the great Yoko whom I thought she was just a walking sex object but her character development and growth prove me wrong because she was so well written that I wished more female character more like Yoko.\n\n10/10\n\n\nFinal Thoughts.\nGurren Lagann are one hell of a amazing piece of art that I loved from start too,,,,, finish.\nIt may have a few issues like the beginning of the post time-skip arc which the show tries too,,,,, more serious and added in romance that was thrown in but in the end all of those issues are forgotten due too,,,,, the amazing story, well developed characters, amazing off the wall art/animation, a kickass OST/OP and some of the best dubs in mecha anime.\nAs much I want too,,,,, give Gurren Lagann a 11/10 I personally can't because out of everything that it did great theyre are that beginning of the post arc which the show kinda really slow down the pacing and for a show that are meant too,,,,, be all over the top super robot action show with very powerful themes like becoming a man the whole Rossiu thing was really out of place.\n\nI give Gurren Lagann a 10/10 ( A amazing mecha show that should not be missed)\nMy personal Anime Recommendations.\nI will be going all out on this one.\n\nKill La Kill\nEureka Seven\nFLCL\nCode Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch\nNeedless\nNeon Genesis Evangelion\nSoul Eater\nRainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin\nSeihou Bukyou Outlaw Star\nHajime no Ippo\nDragon Ball\nInazuma Eleven\nKidou Senkan Nadesico\nSuisei no Gargantia\nTenkuu no Escaflowne\nHeavy Object\nAnyway this has been TheCodeTrigger and I will see you guys next time.\nPeace.\n        "},

The story follows a conventional premise typically seen in the majority Shounen anime (i.e. a large oppressive force that must be overcome through constant battles of ever stronger adversaries).  The differentiation comes in the form of pacing.  Serving as a predecessor to One Punch Man, Gurren Lagan skips the fluff and drills straight to the point — action!  Leading the charge, of course, is our copilot Kamina, a man who neglects standard procedure and charges forward without a second’s thought.  A perfect symbol for the outward appearance of what the show represents: strong, confident, and above all, awesome!

Luckily for us, Gurren Lagann does just that.\nSurprising to numerous viewers, myself included, the characters in Gurren Lagann possess considerable depth for an action based anime.  Sure, the dynamic battle scenes provide ocular pleasure that serves as the focal point of much enjoyment.  But the development of Simon — particularly after episode eight — gives the viewer a human perspective of our main protagonist.  Being the antithesis of his big bro, Simon struggles to assert himself as a clear and respectable leader among his compatriots.  Battling depressive episodes and moments of lashing out against teammates cast doubts among his friends on his aptitude to manage the elevated levels of stress that come with war.\nDespite Simon’s deficiencies, he soon learns that strength exists in several forms, and only through catharsis can he illuminate his tenacity to conquer any challenge.  This new found confidence serves him well for a period of time, until political tensions come to the forefront, presenting new obstacles that cannot be remedied through might alone.\nSimon’s character goes through a metamorphosis of sorts, as he transitions from adolescence to manhood, growing emotionally by learning from his experiences to become the best version of himself that he can possibly be.  The process is not without its fair share of difficulties, but the eventual payoff is worth the transient struggle.  A marvelous coming of age story if there ever was one.\nSpeaking of transitioning from childhood to adulthood, Rossiu (a grounded, rational character among a sea of gladiators) provides insight into someone that lacks talent for the sword, and instead resides himself to the pen.  I speak, of course, about his ability to handle political situations with nuance and pragmatism, rather than hot-blooded emotion.  Several of his decisions may seem questionable at first glance, but examined from the view of an impartial observer, he did what he considered was the greatest good for the greatest amount of people: a utilitarian approach.\nDespite the outcome of said decisions, one must respect his fidelity to protect the citizenry from — what appeared to be — impending doom.  While not popular among the anime community, he had the best of intentions for his people (and yes, I am well aware of the popular proverb: The road to hell is paved with good intentions).  That being said, determining the correct course of action in a world that is neither black nor white, but countless shades of gray, is beyond complicated, especially with the dire consequences presented to our heroes.  Placing blame on a character that did not seek to enrich himself by means of corruption, nor satisfy his ego through self-aggrandizing behavior affirms that he was only slightly misguided with his decision making ability, yet far from reproach.\nThe remaining cast of characters can be summed up in one word: cliched.  Granted, a twenty-seven episode anime that generates a name for itself by concocting inconceivable battle scenes has limited time to expand upon each character to their fullest extent; however, episode twenty-one, in particular, seemed superfluous to the overall story, missing an opportunity to build upon Yoko’s character, rather than tacking on an unproductive side anecdote.  That being taken into consideration, one cannot be too harsh on the simplistic approach of several characters within the show.  After all, we are dealing with Mecha’s that can merge at the drop of a hat, produce substantially larger drills out of thin air, and can exceed all limitations through sheer force of will.  If we can suspend disbelief for all of these other phenomena, perhaps overlooking some underdeveloped characters is possible as well.  \nIf the various side characters are nothing more than one-dimensional character tropes (which seems to be the case), it is bearable due to the intermittent moments of comedic relief that they provide to offset the non-stop action.\nThe art/animation is sensational throughout the series.  While the battle scenes maintain a fast clip, everything feels smooth and well defined.  Complex movements are integrated seamlessly as they never interrupt the natural flow of the fight.  The amazingly bold color palette creates a vibrant atmosphere, especially the use of red and blue as symbols of strength and heaven (piercing the heavens).  Overall, it is a beautiful piece of art that may feel a bit over the top, but considering the circumstances, fits splendidly within the context of the anime.\nThe soundtrack is an instant classic that belongs in everyone’s personal collection.  One cannot help but feel invigorated by listening to this exhilarating score of vivacious music. \nIn addition, the actors/actresses deserve high praise for their respective performances.  They all seemed to understand the overall tone the writers were going for and executed their vision with superb precision.  Both the dub and sub are equally respectable, in this regard, and there should be no reason to not enjoy both of them equally.\nGurren Lagann is a constant reminder that personal enjoyment should not be sacrificed in the quest for cognitive refinement.  Indulging in “comfort anime” allows you to drift into the temporary feeling of being a care-free child again, forgetting about the importance of substantive story lines, and focusing solely on being entertained.  There are plenty of intellectually stimulating anime that hit all the criteria for eruditely inclined individuals, but few action anime as well done as Gurren Lagann that allow you to recline your chair, grab your popcorn, and have a damn good time.\n9/10 — Top notch action anime\n        "},

That's the Team (Dai-)Gurren way!\"\nOn a lot of people's top ten list, including the top anime rankings list for this website is the show Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. So I took a good look at this show and said why not let's give it a try. However, just like any review on this website, this is just a personal opinion and not factual statements. In fact I will say it now: Go watch this show despite what I say in this review.\nThe art is good...for the most part. Why do I say that? The early\n          \n        episodes are pretty weak in visuals and while there is some great animation here, the actual art of the show is pretty sloppy and often a just a big mess. Often things will happen at once and the colors will be splattered everywhere not giving the time to take in scenery or you know appreciate the animation. The animation certainly gets better as the show progresses but sometimes it become inconsistent and makes everything seem out of any control. The animation is pretty good, I just feel like it needed more artistry and needed to be more visually-stunning.\nSound is a step above the animation. The score provides epic music for those big moments that the show puts fourth and actually does it in a way that will send chills all over the body. The soundtrack is pretty good and yes is probably one of the best soundtracks of an anime. Trust me, after this anime you will not get \"ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH\" out of your head, which is actually a good thing. I did watch this show dubbed which is actually pretty good with strong performances by Yuri Lowenthal, Johnny Yong Bosch, Kyle Hebert, Michelle Ruff (despite the fact that she annoys me a lot), and Steve Blum in probably his strangest yet awesome role. I heard that the subbed Kamina is actually pretty epic but I believe that nonetheless that the show is great in both languages.\nBy this point, you the reader are probably thinking that I really must've liked this show because of how good it is on the technical side of things. Well, all of you who have seen this show, get ready to push the Not Helpful button in 3...2...1...: I HATE GURREN LAGANN. There I said it because to me this is the most overrated anime of all time. I really don't get why this is so critically acclaimed. Why do I hate this show? This story is dumb and things that occur do not make sense at all. You are probably thinking \"Well can't you excuse it for not having logic?\" To which I answer NO!\nWell okay, I do get that a lot of people like this show because of how manly it is and its conveyance the message of going the distance. I applaud the fact that this is a very inspiring story. However, there are so many flaws in this plot that prevent me from taking it seriously. Things just happen without any logic or acknowledgement for the laws of physics, most evident in the climax of the show. A lot of characters are forgettable, and the ones you get to know the most have moments where you just hate them such as when the most likable character gets killed off leaving one of the characters in an unlikable depressed state. Deus Ex Machinas happen all the time and honestly things happen so fast that trying to understand it will take you a long while. It's amazing how something like this gets made without these flaws ever being acknowledged...but despite all I say about the plot, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it at all, in fact it is the opposite.\nAs much as I despise this anime and the disgustingly high amount of accolades it gets, you have to realize, I watched this show till the end. Yes, the plot is god awful and really needed a lot of tuning. However, this show can be very fun to watch and when it is fun, it is really fun. There is one episode that I keep watching over again and that is the uncensored episode 6, which in my opinion is freaking hilarious. When I like the characters, I root for them and I know that's the real appeal of the show, the passion and likeability of the ambition of these characters. There are epic mecha battles here and they are fun to watch. If this enjoyment wasn't swayed by the fact that a lot of things doesn't often make sense, then I would've liked Gurren Lagann a lot, but my opinion is my opinion.\nGO WATCH THIS SHOW! Seriously, if you have not seen this anime then you are missing out. I may hate Gurren Lagann a lot because of it's ridiculous plot, high amount of forgettable characters, and inconsistent animation, but I think just like Neon Genesis Evangelion, a very similar mecha anime that also despite the accolades it gets is also considered overrated, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann should not be passed because trapped in all the nonsensical bullshit there is an inspiring story. I wish I actually did love this anime like the rest of anime fan base but I honestly can't bear myself to believe that this can be high quality show. In the end, this show really should not be passed up by any anime fan because everyone should experience this anime and make up their own opinions.\n        "},

Dispel them. \nIf I could teleport to any person reading this review right now, I would be bowing on my hands and knees for this: I beg, plead, and implore you to watch this masterpiece.\nLet me spin you a tale. A tale of a boy fresh out of high school, confused about the world. A tale of a boy who was unconditionally loved by his family and friends, but still did not have self confidence or self respect. A tale of a boy who, despite his bigger body stature, felt weak and frail. \nThis boy went online\n          \n        one summer night after high school was over, with college looming only a few months away. This boy went to an online chatroom and talked to others about anime although his knowledge on the topic was limited at the time. Someone told the boy about this show called Gurren Lagann, and how the boy should look it up. The boy left the chatroom later on, and didn't think much about looking the show up, until suddenly, the boy's curiosity got the best of him. He watched the first episode of the show, then proceeded to watch the entire show within a span of 2 days. This boy saw the masterpiece, but the masterpiece saw the boy as well. It jumped from the screen and SOCKED him in the face, screaming \"LEMME SEE YA GRIT. THOSE. TEETH!!!!!\" The boy's mind was mixed, his heart jumbled. What did all of this mean? That summer, as the boy went to work and spent his lazy summer days off playing games, all the while he thought back to the show. He wanted to understand it and it's message. After a good long while of pondering, the boy finally felt himself grow, not quite into a man yet, but he got closer. HE PROGRESSED. All his self doubt and fear and confusion dissipated like mist. He spent the next few years remembering the messages and lessons this show taught him as he sapped knowledge from all around him. He formed his OWN ideals, his OWN philosophies, and found his OWN truth. The boy is now a man. And this MAN asks of you: PLEASE watch this show. Watch it, ponder it, re-watch it again. There is much to learn. I am an admin on a Gurren Lagann facebook page with (presently) well near 60K likes. I have conversed with MANY Gurren Lagann fans, and I can tell you this with full confidence: This show has LITERALLY saved lives. Gurren Lagann has saved people from the depths of depression and sadness and uplifted them. It is a wonder. It is an art. If you are struggling with depression or sadness or self-doubt of any kind, PLEASE give this show a chance. It is not 100% guaranteed to help, but there's a damn good chance it will. All you have to do is search and click a few links and watch some videos. Everything about this show is spectacular to me, and it always will be. This show will always be my favorite, no matter what, 'cause it helped my dig through all the negativity and doubt to find myself... the REAL me. You can do it too! Even if you're not struggling with anything right now, check this one out anyway. It's called an anime legend for a reason. It's a must-see. I hope you learn as much as I did by watching this. Drills are the perfect symbol of progression. Bit by bit, they progress. Bit by bit, as do we. May your drill create your tomorrow forever more. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Okay, I just finished TTGL, and I feel like I have to write something about it, so here's my first review. You have to know that I'm french so I may make some mistakes. This review is spoiler free (nothing more than episode 1 or 2).\nThis anime, is the most impressive I have EVER seen. To say what TTGL really is about may be impossible, it talks about how you make your dreams come true, how you fight for what you think is true, how you repel the limits to do the impossible.\nIf you haven't seen TTGL yet, you're going to embark on an epic\n          \n        and unforgettable journey, trust me, you'll never forget this anime.\nSo, to sum up the story very quickly, Kamina and Simon are 2 best-friends that live in a village under the surface. One day, attempting to reach the surface, they meet a girl, Yoko, and will discover the upper world with Lagann, the little mecha Simon managed to find while drilling to reach the surface.\nNow come the rates : \nStory : 10/10\nThe story is really simple, but a major part of the plot twists are still impredictable, and, as you probably guessed, this is how you end up with an amazing story. The anime managed to finish every side story it opened, to end the anime with a very acceptable ending, and, the most important, the watcher never feel lost, because the structure of the story is enough good to guide you easily and unconsciously. But don't get me wrong, the story will definitely not spare you.\nArt : 10/10\nBefore watching TTGL, you have to know one thing : it's context of production. Gainax (the studio) didn't make any really \"hyped\" anime since a while and they feared the bankruptcy. So, they decided to invest a colossal amount of money into one original project : Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, they savior. And what happens when you put together an amazing studio (Gainax is at the origin of the anime Evangelion) and a LOT of money ? You end up with an anime that aired in 2007, with an art just as good as One Punch Man's art.  This comparison is really interesting, because there are a lot of similitaries between the art of thoses two anime, but don't forget that TTGL is 8 years younger than OPM. So, the art is absolutely gorgeous, some times there are exaggerated drawing, you can find some black and white, and some distortions, all of them in an artistic goal don't worry, but never any derp face or any of these little failures showing that the studio rushed the realisation. And during battles, it's soooo beautiful, there's nearly not any, or maybe a veeeery little part of some scenes (I didn't saw it though), 3D animation, everything is perfectly animated, you have to look to your entire screen cause there's not only the center which is interesting. And the action is clear, again, you are not lost in just a big amount of explosions. \nSound : 10/10 \nThe OST of TTGl is pure awesomeness, you find everything. From rap to opera, even the two mixed in one, epic battle soundtracks, emotional piano songs, rock/hard rock tracks, even some tracks that are the definition of hope itself. \nConcerning the voice acting, it is absolutely flawless, from Simon, Kamina and Viral yells to Yoko's charming voice, not to mention Boota's strange noises, it's absolutely perfect. You can feel how the voice actors have invested themselves in this delirious project that is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.\nCharacter : 10/10\nIn TTGL, I can easily name 6 or 7 characters who would have the potential to carry an anime alone, every single character is well developped and extremly itneresting. Particularly the main and close supporting cast, they are numerous but every one of them is perfectly integrated. We don't know many things about their past, except maybe for Simon, but it's absolutely justified, because TTGL never look back, as a drill, the anime never stop to progress, from the ground to heaven. And trust me, you will remember every character of TTGL, because each of them made you laugh so hard that you will not forget. This anime also have the most charismatic character ever, Kamina, incarnation of virility.\nLittle extra : Yoko is god damn hot, and so are (in their own way) the other female characters in this anime.\nEnjoyment : 10/10\nAfter what i said, impossible to give other than 10 to this section. TTGL is the most enjoyable anime I have ever seen. Everything is made so that the watched never feel bored, and is always excited and hyped for the next episode. Truly, I don't know how it is possible to watch this anime while airing, you CAN'T wait for the next episode, even if that involve sleeping only 4 or 5 hours, you just can't stop watching it. \nOverall : 10/10\nTTGL is maybe, even more than Kill la Kill, the most over the top anime ever. Overkill is a thing here. And you'll never regret it. You don't have to turn your brain off to enjoy TTGL, just remember to be open for everything, because you'll get more than you could ever imagine. This anime will made you laugh so hard that your cheeks are going to hurt, and an anime managing to do this while bringing a touching and kind of philosophical story (how you should act during your life, don't worry, it's really light), a killing OST, an Art above everything and finally, charismatics and very attaching characters, I just call it a masterpiece. \nI will finish this review by quoting one of the main theme :\n\"Do the impossible, see the invisible, ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER\nTouch the untouchable, break the unbreakable, ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER\" From OST #22, Libera me From Hell.\nThat's all for me, thanks for reaching the conclusion of my review, I gladly accept any critic toward the writing style of the review or whatever you may think I need to improve.\nThanks, and watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann !\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    We’re all in the ever-expansive process of building and shaping our lives, morphing and molding them to be our own unique journey. Life rotates and expands at its base, constantly digging into treasures and dangers alike, just like a drill. It has plenty of bittersweet moments and suffering, as well as just as many fantastic, wonderful experiences. \nWe have the privilege today, of exploring quite possibly the most empowering “coming of age” epic in the history of anime, another person’s journey that is plenty qualified to influence our own.\n\n---PLOT---\nAll the humans on Earth have been forced to live below ground, fearing for their lives as\n          \n        the beastmen on the surface roam in gigantic, mechanical gunmen, patrolling for any wandering people who happen to escape. A young boy, by the name of Simon, and his brother figure, Kamina, will soon realize their destiny as men fighting fate to pierce the heavens. Simon, while digging tunnels, discovers a miniature gunman of his own, and together, with the young woman Yoko from the underground village next to them, they form the unbreakable team “Gurren Lagann,” and fight for humanity’s privilege to finally live on the surface once more. \nThis anime takes the words “insanity” and “over the top” and smacks them to hell and back. It is absolute madness from start to finish, with hyper-stylized storytelling and visuals. Even if it can’t be taken seriously at face value, is profoundly touching at its core. We follow the characters and their refute against the beastmen throughout almost their whole lives, and watch them form relationships and bonds that are as dynamic as they come. Their likability is only heightened when one realizes that the losses in Gurren Lagann impact the course of the story and the motivation behind everyone on screen. Death isn’t thrown to the side; it is a powerful force that inspires others to live and honor their sacrifice.\nDrill past the wackiness, “kick logic to the curb,” and you’ll see the beef of Gurren Lagann. Gurren Lagann is an allegorical commentary of a young boy turning into a man, and his journey through self-discovery. It is an active satirical parody of the mecha and adventure genres, and manages to present itself as a new rendition of “The Hero’s Journey,” with a coat of paint so completely bizarre that it seems almost impossible for it to be as deep as it is. And that’s really its beauty; it can be taken any way you want to take it. Because make no mistake, it is really, really easy to not take it seriously, especially at the beginning. But then, after a handful of episodes for reasons I can’t discuss, its true potential as a newfound classic blossoms into sight, and that sentiment of it being mindless flips right around. \nGurren Lagann constantly one-ups itself with bigger and better battles and fights that evolve from just a couple of robots kicking it off to having them toss around galaxies and manipulate the space time continuum. These constant increases in intensity symbolize the common boy growing older, and his struggles to become superior to his past self. Strive for your goals, don’t believe in yourself, and don’t believe in the friends that believe in you. Believe in the YOU that believes in YOU. Continue getting better, and never give up! That is what Gurren Lagann strives to say.\nHell, the anime even uses references to Plato’s “Allegory of the Cave” and the “Epic of Gilgamesh” to achieve what it sets out to do. Its messages are the driving force; the rest of the story is completely dependent on them. If it weren’t for its genius disposition as an outlook of a boy growing up, then the plot would be one hell of a stupid wreck. But because the entire thing is completely built upon this metaphor, it isn’t. You don’t have to turn your brain off. You can, that’s definitely a viable option for going about enjoying this anime. But it’s just as enjoyable at its profound core, as it is at its playful exterior. I’d take the former route; being able to enjoy an anime intellectually when it’s labeled as one that isn’t serious is a most rewarding experience. Go into this anime knowing it’s about a person aging through adolescence, and you’ll understand its genius.\nGurren Lagann can be a crazy mecha beat em’ up. It can be a political drama. It can be whatever the hell it wants to be. You can laugh at Gurren Lagann for being the anime equivalent to a B movie on crack. You can sit at the edge of your seat as you watch the fights as they destroy entire planets. Or, you can stare into its vortex of individuality as an anime that uses parody to represent its vast array of themes and insights on the life of a maturing boy.\n---Plot Score: -Amazing- ---\n\n---CHARACTERS---\nSimon the Digger hails from the underground village “Jeeha.” Orphaned due to an earthquake, he’s been called ugly, smelly, and undesirable throughout his whole life. He’s spends his time digging through the crust of the earth with his hand operated drill, searching for whatever he may find, unaware that he’s missing a vital portion of his soul.\nThat one thing capable of filling said gap is Kamina. He’s a wild, egotistical maniac of a man who stands by Simon as his “brother.” After witnessing a volcano erupt and seeing how it randomly exploded in a burst of fiery passion, he thought to himself, “That sounds just like me!” He’s a mentor to Simon, and Simon looks up to him like his own flesh and blood. They’re relationship as companions who will do anything for each other sets up the brotherly tone of the anime and foreshadows emotional events to come. Kamina has an over-whelmingly positive affect on the whole cast, especially Simon, who goes through astronomical growth in character, turning from a frail and timid child into a more than capable, confident, and willing adult. Simon embodies change at its core because of these alterations, and this embodiment spirals outward like a drill that pierces his ever-spinning and evolving story. His gunman, Lagann, is connected to him emotionally, and won’t respond when he’s lost the will to continue. But by the fate of this loved ones being placed in his hands time and time again, he begins to understand just how much will he needs to gather in order to become the best he can be. As his will becomes infinite, so does the potential of his gunman.\nHe might be a horrified little shrimp when confronted by a gunman in episode one, but by episode twenty-seven, he’d be roaring to destroy them all, with a smile on his face the whole damn time. \nThe third main character is a young woman by the name of Yoko, a skilled sniper that hails from the village of Littner. Despite being displayed as generic jerkbait, she’s far from the damsel in distress. While Simon embodies change and growth, and Kamina personifies influence and leadership, Yoko is on the side of determination and willpower. She’s hotheaded at times, and like everyone, occasionally loses her way, but is more than capable of leading entire battalions to victory with sheer persistence. \nAnd they’re not the only fleshed out portion of the cast. Almost everybody else is just as much a driving force in Gurren Lagann as the leads are. Development has not only graced the main three, but it has also touched the many other secondary characters in the anime as well. Their interactions actually take up quite a lot of screen time. \nA good example of a secondary character with tremendous growth is Rossiu. He’s a boy that hails from the overly religious colony of Adai, and goes through fantastic changes and maturities. Introduced as being initially unsure of himself, with the help of harsh reality and the fate of the Earth placed on his shoulders, he transforms into a brilliant leader, overshadowing his once quiet disposition.\nEven many of the villains go through these defined changes. In this tale of growth and maturity, nearly everyone matures in some way. But at the end of it all, the story is about Simon, and his direct relationships that cause him to grow as a human being. And at that, it succeeds without fail.\n---Characters Score: -Amazing- ---\n\n---ANIMATION---\nHere’s a fun game kids! I call it; “Use as many crayons as possible”! Hang it up and walla! That colorful portrait is representative of every action scene in Gurren Lagann, magnified by ten thousand and one.\nThe pallet of Gurren Lagann, especially the gunmen, contains every shade of the rainbow and then some. I swear, someone was sitting there trying to animate this thing and they thought to themself, “I didn’t even know this many colors existed.” \nWith a shonen-esque style, and a brilliant way of going about executing it, TTGL rewrites your original opinions about how epic a fight can be. The rather plain backgrounds make the dynamically choreographed action pop directly out of the screen, and its insanity creates a fantastic atmosphere. Swirls and slashes radiate everything moving, and while the shape consistency is outright atrocious, that’s part of its flashy charm. \n---Animation Score: -Amazing- --- \n\n---SOUNDTRACK---\nThe soundtrack of Gurren Lagann plays… very quietly. My friend actually said to me, “I don’t think there’s a soundtrack at all.” I don’t necessarily agree with him, but I have to come out and say the music is hard to notice with the visuals and constant yelling. But what we do get ends up being Engrish Rap, something perfect for the style of TTGL.\n“Libera me From Hell” is a track that has become famous (along with episode 4, but I’ll refrain from speaking about that visual mess) among the community and fanbase of Gurren Lagann. Ironically, it doesn’t play very much. But when it does, it multiplies the potency of the anime like rabbits multiply their population. Row Row, Fight the Power!\nThe opening is a rare cookie in the giant cookie jar of anime openings; in that it doesn’t change. The anime is split into two parts, so the visuals and verse switch, but not the song itself. Like almost everything else this anime has to offer, Sorairo Days is a powerful opening, and we’re lucky to have it, as well as the two fantastic endings.\n---Soundtrack Score: -Amazing- ---\nAFTER REPORT:\nPROS:\n- Engaging story that while isn’t really complex or original at its core, is entertaining the whole way through, and takes itself seriously while still not taking itself seriously\n- Amazing characters, all of which develop and are personifications of things like change, influence, and so on.\n- Can be brain food or mindless. Really is up to the viewer\n- Over the top visual style and fantastic music\n- Powerful and emotionally engaging metaphor for growing up and becoming a hero\n- Beautiful ending\nMIXED:\n- Brain food route may be hard to actually put to use, this anime would be the number one product at a cheese convention. \nCONS:\n- Music is a bit too quiet, or overshadowed by the scene and dialogue\n- Gets a bit repetitive (though thats part of the spinning drill metaphor)\nOverall: -Brilliant-\nF***ing Gurren Lagann made me cry.\nBecause paired with Simon’s outrageously satisfying character development and the perfectly portrayed story of a “boy becoming a man,” it touched my heart. I related too it, because I’m a boy becoming a man! \nFascinatingly unique and entertaining as all get-out, TTGL is a fantastic anime worth watching for anyone. It has a very broad range of appeal and is surprisingly easy to sit through. Let’s say you’ve been searching for that one thing, that one crazy, over the top, absolute madness and insanity induced ride of an anime. If you’re looking for adventure, initial simplicity that turns into complexity and passion, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is absolutely the pick for you. Go into it however you see fit, watch it however you think is the best way of viewing it, because it’s a rollercoaster from start to finish.\nWith my newfound power, I drill to the score… of 10/10 \nCAUSE JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM?"},

In whole MassEffect series, there is less pathos than in average series of this anime. Speeches in Lord of the Rings look like school drama theater\n          \n        in comparison to Kamina's ones. You think that you already know about struggle? You are wrong! (If you didn't see this series). Kamina, Simon, Yoko - they fight literally Impossible and they never go back and they win. Do the Impossible, See the invisible! ROW!ROW! FIGHT THE POWER!!\nIf shortly, Gurren Lagann is the standard of epic cool story. Heroes speak over-epic speeches, and no one can possibly doubt about trueness of them. Heroes do the unbelievable things. And they do it cool way, MANS WAY. You hit a wall? HIT IT HARD!. Does not working! HIT HARDER! They had bigger mech? Ok, hitting hard will help in this case too, but better bring a bigger hammer. You need to cross an ocean? Take an oar and row like never before. Moon is falling? You still do not understand? Hit it! True heroes do not look for roundabout ways, they strike into the front. And the universe will bow to their coolness.\n--Music and Animation--\nMusic of different genres is connected in this masterpiece. Rock, rap and opera fit so well in this story. Row!Row! Fight the Power! - shows the whole meaning of Gurren Dan. Viral soundtrack - shows the animal strength. Libera me from hell - an epic sound of worlds collision.\nAnimation - fit the story just right. Brutality is shown brutal. Romance is shown romantic. And Humor shown funny. You need something more?\n--Story--\nWho give a ...?\nHumanity must live under the earth, because on surface humans are hunt down by beastmens. This is bad. And some butts must be kicked. Humans can't be stopped by some mortals. Or immortals. Or laws of physics themselves. We are too cool for them all.\n--Characters--\nThey are cool, fun and sincere. And you like them for that. They are not hard to understand, but in the same time, they are not without character. It just simple boys who want to change the world into a better place for them. And Yoko - she is so nice to see and hear. Strong girl with big heart. \nSo buy some ridiculous glasses, turn on this anime and go into the journey that shows the meaning of everything. ROW! ROW! FIGHT THE POWAH!\nP.S. If you try to judge this anime logically it will look something dull. Without a great story, heroes are not the smartest ones, and word \"physics\" or \"logic\" can't be used to describing this anime at all. But you can't watch this coldhearted, this anime must boil your blood and you forget about any minuses of series."},

At first, I think it is the same as others mecha anime: A weak boy find out a robot and use it to fight. But Gurren Lagann's story isn't as simple as I expected.

An epic story presented in ridiculously creative ways, taking you in the cockpit of a machine that will soar through the heavens and beyond!\nOkay, forgetting my attempted humor, TTGL took place on a universe where there is a war of mechas on the outside along with layers of mysteries and plot elements if you look deeper inside. The thing with this anime is the fact that while it doesn't stem from logic, it still somehow succeeded at creating a brilliant entertainment. Sure, there were times where it\n          \n        was anticlimactic or everything went a bit too perfect that lessened up the suspense, but it was still a highly spirited work of fiction. An outstanding feature was the tight-knit group of fun and diverse characters. Everyone had a funny personality and they are supplementary to each other. Though this indestructible relationship allowed them to fight, they also have to test each other out which formed the drama, tragedy and romance. It's the most elaborate connection of friendship I've ever seen. With that in mind, I definitely felt the dangerous aura from the enemies, an actual threat that gets you to fear for your favorites' fate. They possessed common sense and interesting natures, giving way to a focus centering around peace, conflict and survival. To grow up, to become stronger, to survive and learn their mistakes, these factors developed the characters in an excellent manner.\nTTGL had an art which is intrinsic to how it was laid out, that is cartoonish simplicity. This style fitted perfectly with the enthusiasm from the characters and battles. The designs were also great, boasting a cool set of mecha designs that honestly awakened my inner childish soul, especially during transformation scenes. So let's talk about an important factor every episodes had, the battles of mechas. You can definitely say that they were eruptively thrilling, being all fast-paced and such. Each battles were helped by the top quality in animation, making good use of choreography that caused explosive excitement to ran through my whole body. I've never felt bored watching these clashes. Another thing that my other sense, this time the ears, loved is the passionate voice-acting. The inspiring speeches and dialogues that came out of the character's mouths doesn't bore you like something gibberish because human-like qualities such as hope or anger were carried within them. They also made the exaggerated humors even funnier. Many of the great variety of soundtracks go along well with the most emotional and action-packed scenes. Also with the sound effects too, which enhanced many of the scenes that took place in the story.\nDon't even bother finding logic in this anime. Forgetting that will make you realize how unique TTGL was, using common tropes of battle Shonens with a heightened approach. Its uniqueness that contained memorable characters, speeches and battles can describe this kind of show in one simple word. Iconic.\n        "},

This series is coming of age action series that will make you smile, laugh and cry with its insane story full of anime cliches. Its one of these shows that I hate to finish and wish I can wipe my memory to enjoy the epicness all over again.\nThe story follows the exploits and life of a young boy named Simon who finds a very small mech while digging to\n          \n        expand his underground village. With this mech Simon embarks on a journey to the surface with another man who acts as Simons big brother Kamina, A female sniper named Yoko as well as a cast of supporting characters. The journey of Simon and crew has one purpose which is to make the surface habitable for humans by defeating the beastmen who drive their own mechs to prevent humans from going to the surface . \nI give the story a 10 our 10 because its a story with a simple concept presented in an amazing fashion. It carries itself on a lot of humor however the story has the most impact on its saddest and darkest moments which are  delivered well. Those moments are later followed by some of the best mech fights I have seen in an anime. Unlike ordinary fights in mechas these have more passion because things are more personal and the characters are stronger than before. \nI give the art a solid ten for its amazingly done 2d mech fights. I never really agreed with people that 3d mech finds are way worse that than the 2d ones as all seemed the same to me. The mech fights in this anime have drawn me more to the 2d side as these fights where beautiful with the movement of the mechs, the colors, the characters faces when doing epic things with the mechs. The animation outside of mech finds was good when it comes to anime and noting seemed to crisp or smooth. The designs of the mechs and the characters are interesting and pretty unique for all.  \nThe soundtrack for this anime is comprised of a load of action music and music that you would use for an epic moment where someone does something badass. That with the opening you get a decent soundtrack for an action series but not too amazing. \nThe characters of the series where all unique in their roles with a decent level of character development to make you care about them. The main character Simon is a character that gets more interesting as the story progresses. What we see in the beginning is a small kid who is afraid to stand up for himself who later gets the right to stand along the other bad asses he associates and protect the weak with when he turns into a strong character on his own.  \nKamina the man who acts as a brother to Simon in the series is probably one of the unique and manliness guys in anime in terms of personality as he does what he does for the sake of being a man. He is also a very inspirational character who can get people who find him annoying to share his thoughts and emotions and acts as a perfect role model for Simon. Other characters in this series server to be catalyst that help Simon get stronger and encourage to challenge new feats. \nIn terms of my enjoyment of the series I give this show the highest score as I got giddy in the best moments of the show knowing badassary is upon my view.\n\nStory 10/10 \nArt 10/10\nSound 8/10\nCharacter 10/10 \nEnjoyment 10/10\nOverall 9.5/10"},

This anime made me do 50 push-ups then I collapsed at 5 but hell that didn't stop me oh no I was like \"OH FLOOR HELL NO JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM\" as I continued till' I actually reached 50 then i just collapse to the floor then rested there for 30 minutes.\nNow why did I just give an anecdote at the very opening of this review? Well this is an anime where you either think it's a masterpiece, that has transcended all anime and is now in a realm wherein the whole entertainment media as a whole must\n          \n        take on this godlike manuscript as it's bible of sorts, or it's just another over hyped anime which looks childish and overly ridiculous and as my anecdote implies i am part of the super fanboys group. \nTTGL is an anime that defies the modern entertainment media wherein everything supposed to be hyper-realistic, about angsty teenage problems, humans when faced with death psychology, or whatever the fuck is supposed to be popular these days (i dunno twilight or whatever) and instead delivers on the good ol' willpower trumps all and a pissy crybaby gets so much character development that if it was given to a generic cardboard cutout anime MC they'd be 69 times more interesting in the end and would look like chuck norris and not a pussy.\nThe Characters\nNow that being said the characters are a total joy to watch, I mean yes they are quite stereotypical and aren't characters that break from the mold, but they achieve that stereotypical role so dynamically that i never even cared how stereotypical they sounded like because it executed it so well that it didn't feel annoying or tedious and it felt refreshing in some way. The supporting cast were so fleshed out in a short amount of time that they felt so natural and human no matter how ridiculous and over the top they were. God this anime is amazing\nThe Animation\nThe animation was great but better watch out for the dreaded episode 4 that seems to be a problem but everything else looks super duper bad ass and awesome and oh my god This Is The Best Anime Ever! the art is my type of art where it seems sketchy, cartoony and cute but still realistic enough to looks bad ass when it wants to. So yeah great animation\nThe Sound\nThe voice acting was the best in both english and japanese which is a good thing because the english dub is really great for showing to newcomers to the anime family and the japanese dub was as equally great giving the hardcore sub watchers a treat of their own, but in my opinion I'd rather watch it dubbed because it's much harder to jam to your favourite anime when your understanding of the dialogue is largely based on the small words on the bottom part of the screen. \nThe music was very attuned with the atmosphere which is really nice but nothing really amazing to talk about except this \"Row Row Fight the power\"\nThe Story\nNow this is the part where TTGL makes good with because the story is so epic that it made me do push ups but seriously it's story is so simple but awe inspiring, super motivational and will make you feel like you balls shrank three sizes that day just for not being in TTGL. So yeah super influential\nMy Feelings\nOverall this anime is kinky, over the top, awesome and exaggerated and that's just how I like it. Everyone should watch it but if you don't like mindless fun watch it when your drunk but in my opinion everyone who likes anime would probably like it unless their some pompous prick who think their over all this childishness and would rather do more mature adulty things like watch a soap operas then please bugger off TTGL cause' you'd probably find more amusement in designing spreadsheets or filing taxes.\n        "},

You will hear 'My drill is a drill that will pierce through heavens!', or something like that anyway. And it pretty much sums up the whole story. It starts slowly at first, then gets faster and climaxes at the end of the story. You may also think of it as our protagoists start at the lower part of the drill, and make their way to the higher end of it. Only negative thing I can think of it is that it's too simple. The perfect shounen anime where the enemies are strong, you\n          \n        get stronger, then the enemies get stronger and bigger, and you have to get bigger and stronger as well. In the end the Gunman's name has 5 words and the ultimade move has 6 words which they just can't seem to fit them in 10 seconds. Saying the move takes like 15 seconds minimum.\n9/10\nArt: The art is...epic. The characters are well drawn and have smooth colors. I still don't know how the hell were they able to find Nia's eyes. Yoko provides fanservice till the end of the anime and it pleases male viewers of course ^^ The most amazing thing about art is how it goes more 'brutal' as the fight gets tougher. You get to see more black lines, drawings get rougher. But it all seems so natural that it's scary. Speed, strenght and all those screams fit together with the art, perfectly.\n10/10\nSound: I usually recognise the sound in the anime, but this time I don't recall anything about music except for the opening. I rewatched the last episode and then understood why. The action is soo good that the music gets shadowed by it. Of course TTGL wouldn't been as successful as this if the music was crappy, but you can't really feel it like the sound of Bleach or earlier episodes of Naruto. Giving it 9 for the sake of keeping the overall 10, should've been 8.\n9/10\nCharacters: Totally unique. Really! It's not a joke! Kamina is every men's idol, able to overcome everything by brute force and fighting spirit. Simon starts as the little 'wannabe Kamina', but really evolves during the series. He adopts Kamina's signature sentence, 'just who do you think I am!' I first thought that Yoko is included beause you can't make a shounen anime without a beautiful girl, but she really becomes important. Even that forehead guy and all the people Kamina and Simon meets get important. Even if Kamina was the only single character in the anime, I'd still give this a 10.\n10/10\nEnjoyment: What can someone give this part anything besides 10 out of 10? The amazing fight scenes keep you interested and makes you want more. The anime never ceases to make you laugh. I mean, they always use the same move. But when mechas get bigger, the moves get bigger, and so does their name. In the end you can't do anything but laugh at that stupid name XD\n10/10\nOverall: This is your perfect shounen anime. It was nice taking a break from Bleach (already dropped Naruto-they were getting crappy anyway) and watching this anime. Girls, stay away unless you really like mecha. Boys, I don't care if you are 9 or 39 years old, watch this. You'll like it. Now, who was the company that made this?\n10/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Never before have I seen a show so touching, so enjoyable, and so broad in scope as Gurren Lagann.  If your a fan of Studio Gainax, and more recently, studio Trigger, you'll know what I mean when I say its brilliant in the weirdest of ways.  Its effectively a story about will power, human spirit, and evolution, but it can be enjoyed if you only care about mechs beating the crap out of each other.  The style is as over the top and quirky as they come.  Every single good guy is hot blooded and full of fighting spirit, if not,\n          \n        then they'll most likely have a character arc where they learn to be hot blooded.  The art is incredibly expressive and smooth, and there's innuendo at every turn.  Like I said, typical for studio Gainax.  There isn't just one strength that stands out in particular, but every bit of the series feels so well planned out that its nearly perfect.  \nThe story starts out underground, where humans are starving to death, live without light, and can be crushed by earth quakes at any moment.  Sounds like a bummer but the show gives you a beacon of hope and happiness in the characters.  Just ask any one who's ever seen this show-  Kamina is the freaking bomb.  His charisma and hot blooded personality is so infectious that it extends to the viewers, as well as every character whom he interacts with in the show.  He's the lovable, reckless, hero of the story, although it's set from a young, shy boy named Simon's point of view.  I originally dismissed him as a whiny kid, but there's more than Simon than meets the eye, and I eventually grew to love the him as much as Kamina.  There's also, of course, Yoko.  Let's be honest, Yoko and her character design are probably more popular than the show itself.  But make no mistake, Yoko fits in with the cast of manly freedom fighters perfectly, and she gets a mountain of character development throughout the series.  I could of spent ten years of research, but I would never have been able to put together such a perfect cast of character for a show of this style.  Even the minor characters have heart, and lend themselves to the show.  Heck, even characters who only appear for a few seconds have their own fanbase, like Bruce Ironstaunch.  The villains all have interesting motivations, but it never stops you from cheering on the main cast the whole way through.  And while the story itself seems simple at first, things start to take unexpected turns by the end of the first quarter, and the plot really kicks off about half way through, it's hard to talk about without spoilers.\nThere are effectively four parts to the story, each a reconstruction of a different period of mecha.  The first part is fun and lighthearted like those of the seventies. Part two is dramatic and tense like the real robot shows of the eighties. Three is dark and depressing like the Evangelion era of mechs, and the last part does something of its own, hoping to set a new trend for the genre that ultimately never caught on.  Each part is punctuated by a major \"oh crap\" moment and a tone shift.  Its the kind of show that never lets up. I never found myself wondering where it would go next; it was a story unlike any other, and I only wanted to keep watching to find out.  You'll find yourself laughing at every absurd scenario -especially when Kamina's involved-, and heartbroken at every sad  moment.  One moment that I hope you haven't gotten spoiled for you left me so shocked that I had to prematurely end my session that day just to absorb what I'd just watched.  I'm not exaggerating, when I re-watched it with a friend, who actually knew what was going to happen before hand, they were still left in such shock by the timing and effectiveness of a twist that we had to take a walk around my house to cool down. \nI've heard a few complaints about the way conflicts seem to be solved only by willpower and guts rather than through strength or intelligence.  As much as I enjoy smart plans getting put to work like in Code Geass or Death Note, I never felt cheated by this. That's probably because willpower and guts actually have a physical manifestation known as spiral energy in the show.  Fighting spirit literally is a legitimate weapon in this show, worth far more than any Mech. And while we're on the subject of mechs, I'd just like to say that I've never seen robot fights as good as I've seen here. This is all thanks to the smooth animation; most mechas tend to lean more towards grand wars and battles with many soldiers on each side.  That's not the case here, most of the fights are fought only by the titular Gurren Lagann, piloted by Kamina and Simon.  I realize that mecha battles are not for everyone, but I encourage you to give it a try even if your not a fan.  The mechs move with the same agility and movement as a human would in a fight, allowing the fights to have more entertainment value than just shear spectacle.  Some fights are even fought without mechs, and these are entertaining as well. Kamina has a one on one sword fight, and Yoko takes down plenty with just her gun.\nA show as quirky and fun as Gurren Lagann sticks with you, for its originality and bizarre moments. I find it constantly working its way into my head, in fact, there hasn't been a day where I don't think about it since I've watched it (by the way, the soundtrack is also brilliant, and is one of the best I've heard that wasn't composed by Yoko Kanno).  The show plays by it's own rules, and barrows from many different genres.  But honestly, if you only like a specific type a show, like slice of life or serious dramas (not that there's anything wrong with that), you probably wont find much in gurren lagann. And as for its real flaws, there isn't any single one that remains through the whole series.  It could of benefited from an extra episode or two (the creators even said they wanted more), but other than that, its a masterpiece, an absolute much watch.  It's a marvel of story telling, something only anime can do, and its finale has yet to be matched in spectacle or magnitude by anything before or since.  It's my all time favorite work of fiction, and its gorgeous as it is over the top. With something as original as this, you really cant do it justice with words. Just give it a watch.\n"},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="                          \n    Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is one of those anime that you've probably heard of if you hang around anime fans at all or are one yourself. When the anime started running in 2007 the name was everywhere. Mainly due to a large and vocal fanbase. To this day it still has a significant presence in anime fandom. Some call it Gainax's crowning achievement, others say it's an over-rated pile of rubbish. Of course, Gainax's other best known works are Evangelion and Panty & Stocking, so being their crowning achievement wouldn't be much of an accomplishment. In any case, let's take a look at TTGL and\n          \n        see which side is closer to being right. \nThe story is really simple. Humans have been driven underground. In the underground Jiha village, two young men, Kamina and Simon, decide to breakthrough to the surface. But before they can manage the ceiling collapses, letting sunlight in and bringing with it a giant mecha and a young redhead named Yoko. The three defeat the mecha using a machine Simon found while digging and make their way to the surface. Simon and Kamina learn that humans on the surface have been struggling against beastmen and their giant robots known as Ganmen. They decide to take the fight to the beastmen and create a surface where humans can live in peace. From there you get a pretty standard action story. About the only element that stands out is the underlying theme of overcoming the past, while simultaneously carrying it within you. That's the most interesting part of the story. Unfortunately, the ending is pretty weak. A lot of what happens is also heavily exaggerated, often to the point of ludicrous. Which would be fine, except that they try to pull off several serious scenes. Naturally, they don't mesh well with the overall aesthetic and end up invariably falling short. This is also one of those series that doesn't understand evolution, but uses it as a plot point anyway. \nThe characters aren't particularly deep either. Most of them fall into a rather archetypal role and stay firmly rooted within that role. All of the major characters have their own rather trite arcs. All of which are rather predictable and you've probably seen before, and executed better, multiple times. The supporting characters lack even that basic level of development. They tend to have little to no personalities and they just kind of... exist. Most of them end up getting a few scenes, mostly for exaggerated comic relief, but ultimately say and do very little. \nThe art in this is not very good. The character designs are largely borked and kind of silly looking. The action sequences gravitate more towards laughable and over the top in their execution than intense. The final antagonist just looks really stupid. Several of the effects they use towards the end just look bad and the series has ridiculous levels of fan-service. On the positive side, the mecha designs are nicely done overall and the design changes when they do time skips are pretty effective. \nThe voice acting is exaggerated and over the top. Which can get grating at times. There's a lot of shouting as well and the music can get obtrusive at times. The best performance probably comes from Inoue Marina since she's less over the top than most of the other characters and she manages to convey some really good emotional elements, which is really the only element of the serious scenes that works.\nThe ho-yay factor is a 3/10. There is one canonically gay character in this but all he really does is flirt a bit. Unfortunately, he's kind of a stereotype. Although I get the impression that the presentation of his character is less out of malice and more the general trend of not being very well written that's common among all the characters. \nThat's Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, a series that's equal parts machismo, mindless action and over the top absurdity. Is it a masterpiece? Well, no. The art and sound are both rather sub-par. The characters and story are both kind of meh. Is it better than a lot of Gainax's other series? Well, it is entertaining rather than infuriating in its absurdity and it does have some interesting elements. So I'd have to say yes. The bottom line is that if you want something that can give you some cheesy entertainment, this isn't a bad choice. It's not as effective at it as Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, but it comes pretty close. Final rating, 6/10. It's a decent anime but don't expect it to nearly live up to the hype. Well, that's the last review of November. Going into December the request queue is: Psycho Pass, Dennou Coil, Watashi ga Motenai no wa dō Kangaetemo Omaera ga Waru, Kitakubu Katsudou Kiroku & Battle Athletes Daiundoukai. Next week I'll begin with a look at Psycho Pass. If you have a request of your own, just leave me a comment. \n        "},

I loved it. I know, 'why did he give this a low score if he loved it?'\nPeople deciding whether they will watch something or not skip all the tens, and look at all the low scores.  In the case of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann I've selected a 5, because it is the new benchmark by which I judge any anime with\n          \n        an outlandish story of grandeur.\nStory: 10/10. Too many of these reviews incorrectly cite it is a story about beating the next strongest bad guy to become the strongest out there, or a simple 'coming of age' story.  I will not deny its base structure is a coming of age tale.  If it was just that however, no one would care.\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a story about progress.  Not just for you yourself, not one person for other people, but progress in every sense.  It's critical theme is striving forward as much as you can so everyone after you can strive forward as well.  It is a story designed to really let you grasp that your successes are built on the progress of those around you and before you, and you are there to make progress for those coming after you.\nTo break down story arcs, I must stress, watch through episode 9.  My shoujo loving girlfriend trudged through this anime until episode 9.  Then she finished it in two nights while having to deal with her full time job in the interim.  Episodes 1-9 are so-so, even painful.  But, they set the tone.  Episodes 10-15 are one fluid, fast paced sequence of events.  Episode 16 is a recap episode.  After the fast pacing of what happens from episodes 1-15, I don't blame them.\nEpisodes 17-27 could be another show entirely.  I have never seen anything so wonderful as this arc of episodes. It is where this show gets most of my love, and it is where you understand why the characters in the first 15 episodes don't get fleshed out as much as you might like to see them fleshed out.  You see it come to fruition here.  Warriors live the warrior life, friendships are proven again and again and again, and for these respected characters who came from nothing to a place where they have to carry everything for everyone, there is nothing but an understanding that people make way for more people, in an ever striving effort to move forward.\nArt: 7/10. Weakest part of the show, almost made me want to turn it off during episode 1.  Made it through that and watched the whole series the first time in one run.  As it goes along though, it steadily improves, and by the end you understand the art stylization suits it rather well.  It is not beautiful, but Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is not beautiful.  It's truthful.\nSound: 9/10. Other than a few odd music selections from my perspective, the audio is critically amazing at supporting the action or the moment through and through.\nCharacter: 9/10. Almost all of the characters show multidimensional behavior that fleshes out as the story progresses. If I ask someone cosplaying one of these characters to act like the character for an hour straight, they would have a difficult time expressing all sides to a character.  They are not easy to understand when you break down what they do and why they do it, but within the confines of the script, it is easy to see how they make the decisions they make.\nAs to the complexity of the characters, no, there is not going to be some emo goth socially repressed bipolar homicidal bunny lover, but honestly, that is really not a good character.  Good characters are ones that you identify with people that you know in person, yet stand out apart from anyone you've ever met.  This means they've sold you on being human and real, yet being amazing and story worthy.  The reason why we follow a character is they are unlike any we've seen before.\nEnjoyment: 10/10. I don't know why this is really a grading criteria.  This is what you decide after you've watched something, and is totally personal.  For me, this tale of a man's destiny was utterly enjoyable.\nIn conclusion, I may cite 5 here, but for me inside this is a perfect 10.  When you cross combine these elements, you create a perfect blend of balance and correctness that allows you to laugh, love, and cry.  I've seen plenty of anime, and my 5's on my anime list are probably your 7's.  This is a 10 on that list.\n        "},

It is no wonder why this anime is ranked as #1! Tengen Toppa  Gurren Lagann has been, from Episode 1, an absolute thrill ride. Gurren Lagann has it all, a fantastic plot, memorable Characters, genuine comedy, and excellent action scenes. I have been a fan of Mecha since the good old days of Gundam Wing, but Gurren Lagann does something different. It adds a new light as to how mecha animes can be  portrayed. Not only a new\n          \n        light to mecha, but all anime. I heard a lot about Gurren Lagaan, and was intrigued by what I heard and gave the first episode a go, I am extremely happy I did. I have seen a lot of anime, but up until now none of them stood out as the absolute best. Gurren Lagaan changed that. Most anime start out funny and end up being serious, but the problem is how to maintain the level of seriousness while still being able to get a few laughs in.  By far Gurren Lagaan has that perfect median, along with a constant level of action that reminds you that this isn't all jokes and serious matters. Gurren Lagaan will undoubtedly one day become as well known as the other legendary animes, that is a fact. Too bad there isn't a higher score than 10, becuase I would give it a rating of, 'You must be crazy to not love this anime!'. \n        "},

Most people see it simply as a show with nothing but mindless, over the top violence with a boring third arc and two very sad deaths. Me? I see it as one of, if not the best (no, definitely THE best) anime of all time. Over the top action? Check. Sad deaths? Of course. Really good pacing throughout? Yup. A cast full of really good characters? You bet.\n          \n        Mindless throughout? No times infinity. Nearly EVERY moment of the show was in just to show exactly the story the creators wanted to tell, but beyond that, the themes they wanted to show as well. Not only did the show keep going after the time when most anime would have just gone \"done\" and called it a day (when the boy has become a \"man\"), but it kept going, showing that your life isn't over (and you still have a lot to learn) after you've become a man.\nPlus it contains one of my favorite songs out of an anime: Afromania - Minna No Peace"},

I really enjoy series such as Code Geass and Evangelion, but those are on the complete opposite side of the spectrum in terms of enjoyment. Gurren Lagann takes all the things you like about those types of series, and throws them out the window. It doesn't need multi-layered characters, a compelling narrative, or even logic to get its point across. Gurren Lagann relys on 2 things: Feeling and Passion. I have yet to see\n          \n        a show that can match the energy that this show gives off. From its clever and ridiculous humor, to the motivational speeches about the human spirit, and to its balls-to-the-wall action sequences, this show never failed to wildly entertain me throughout.\nStory: 9\n The story, although very simple and cliche, was very effective for the overall feeling of the show. It followed a very basic progression of slowly getting better, and better mechs to finally have a giant face-off to determine the fate of the universe. This simplicity plays really nicely with the overall mood of the show. There was, However, a plot twist in episode 8 that I don't want to spoil, that really caught me off guard for such a upbeat and lighthearted series. Besides that, everything plays out like your normal mecha/shounen.\nArt: 10\nThe animation done by Gainax is breathtaking. The combination of bright colors and fast paces fight sequences made the entire show incredibly enjoyable to watch. For the final few episodes there is a noticeable increase in production value as the finale animation was outstanding. However, there was a noticeable drop in animation quality in episode 4, but it does not take away from the overall quality in animation for this show.\nSound: 10\nGreat high quality soundtrack. Good mixture of hard rock, orchestral pieces, and even some rap. I at first didn't really like the rap section with \"Row Row Fight the Power\", but I got over it after a while. I never found the repetition of tracks to be overbearing like many other shows, and they fit the tone of the show extremely well. I really like the OP song and I really liked how they kept the same song but changed the animation for the OP.\nCharacters: 9\nKamina: Kamina is incredibly entertaining and made me laugh uncontrollably at many points in the beginning of the show. He embodies the mindset of \"do the impossible\" and never backs down from a fight. He may be a 1 dimensional character, but my god does he deliver. Also amazing voice actor.\nSimon: Simon is probably the most developed and well made character of the series. His transition from his shy personality to embodying the mindset of Kamina is one of the highlight of this show for me, and a reason why the final few episodes are so epic. He is a very relatable , lovable, and incredibly bad-ass character who is by far my favorite of the series.\nYoko: Yoko is a a great, strong and independent character. Her temper and attitude are really enjoyable throughout the show. I think they could have toned down on the fanservice quite a bit as it takes away from her bad-assery. However, I really liked her character change after episode 8 as not only did they tone down on the fanservice, but she also got a a good deal of development.\nOthers: Very memorable and lovable side characters, really work well to build up the main cast, especially Simon. \nOverall Enjoyment: 10\nThis show had me dying in laughter, sympathizing with characters, and literally shaking in excitement. I was smiling throughout with how good this show makes you feel. It may not ask the big questions in life, or hold a level of maturity that most other great shows do. But it delivered on a deeper level to me that a review won't do justice. I was reminded what it was like to be like a kid again, and Gurren Lagann will always hold a special place in my heart. I hope that you feel the same way after you watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann."},

Looking deeply into it, it doesn’t look simple rather it’s kind of complicated plot. Also the reason you will\n          \n        be totally attached into it is not because of all the mega robot action fighting scenes, animation, and sounds but the real reason behind it is the perseverance and unique attitudes of oneself to another, ‘hard as a rock’. The enjoyment of each episode is highly connected to the main plot but sometimes it doesn’t give enough enjoyment though, a high – mid feature. It has a fast paced and predictable moment to deal with but nevertheless you’ll never say that ‘oh my, I will never continue watching this because I already predict what will happen at the ending’ and ‘eh? That’s it? I want more!’ because you will surely enjoy each episodes even though it ends quickly and by means that you won’t regret anything about it. Most of all Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann must not be ignored though it’s one of a hell best anime series that was made, its story line is bound with awesome scenes, no long monologue to bore with, pure robot action fighting scenes with lots of guts that will surely give you some intense feeling to your nerves.\nArt, Animation & Sounds:\nThe animation and art is not that perfect and appealing but it fits very well in the series. A goofy and cartoon concept type art with screams and commotions on every character is a very well done. Also the reason behind why Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann will draw you from continuing because it has great animation and amazing BG sound. Machine Robot, technologies, upgrades and maybe some other minor details surely give great pleasure to me. The OP and ED are very amazing, on those hardcore and melodic songs, it surely matched and gave such thrill at the beginning and at the ending of each episode.\nCharacters:\nThe characters here are such fun to watch although they talk serious matters, but they just are on their own self of being happy and energetic. New entry of individual greatly helps to add some enjoyment to it, every individual has a unique characteristic that appeals so much, and it also helps to avoid boredom and to create a special attraction. The character development is quite impressive to think of. On each episode they’re smoothly developing and as soon it goes on, the growth of every character is getting impressive and constantly growing.\nEnjoyment:\nEnjoyment is nonexistent but to recommend this… It cannot be explain into words, but maybe if you watch this you’ll finally understand what it meant. Nothing worse about it but if ever it has, maybe it’s only a kind of a bit glitch. Superb story, awesome animation with a goofy and cartoon concept type art, characters full of guts and nothing will be go wrong if there’s a BG sound that will make you stand off onto your seat.\nOverall:\nOverall, no anime that will be the same level of being cool and awesome of it, since back then when doubting about mecha for some reason made it wrong that this anime is just a waste of time but thinking about now it’s become the opposite of it. Even though it’s predictable and has simple plot elements, for me it’s an awesome anime series. A super mecha action filled anime that will surely excites you up to the end. Now that’s why it’s in the #1 spot because the show will never give you bad impression about it.\n        "},

A lot of the episodes in this show felt like last episodes and when a show is able to deliver episodes of such quality you know you are in for\n          \n        the ride of your life. The story of this show deserves nothing but pure 10/10.\nArt: I was really drawn by the bright colours and easy going animation that Gurren Lagann had, for some reason the animation kinda reminded me of Digimon and the whole goggled main child protagonist scene so it felt nostalgic at first. The many explosions, attacks, beams, were all really cool and really awesome to watch. This show really knows how to keep a good quality in animation despite all the chaos going on.\nSound: The soundtrack for this show is one of the best I've heard, in many other of my reviews I have mentioned I dont really pay much attention to the BG sounds but in this case their songs were so perfect for the moment and so epic that I just couldn't help but listen to it and think \"wow this is just awesome\", with many types of insert songs and epic battle music this show gets perfect score for their music.\nCharacter: Gurren Lagann had A LOT of characters but in reality you dont really care much about any of them except the main characters like Simon, Kamina, Yoko, Nia, and yes I'll even add Viral too. Kamina was just LOL to listen to, but IMO the best developed character in this whole show was Viral, he stats off as a villain assassin but through the events of the series he is in the end destined to fight with those who have humiliated him for so long. Simon is also a very good character since he starts off as a coward of sorts but develops into a courageous fighter in the end, I usually dont like characters that are all 100% justice will prevail but in this case they really did a great job on him as well.\nEnjoyment: I cannot express how much I've enjoyed watching this show, it was so good I still watch it now when I have nothing else to do. Gurren Lagann is deifnitely of my top 5 shows and will proably stay there for a long time to come.\nOverall this show is something that everyone who enjoys their action MUST DEFINITELY watch, it's an adrenaline rush since episode 1 and it's definitely one of the best animes you can watch out there\n        "},

This is an anime that had myself by the face for several months. \nThe storywriting is great. There are a few holes in it, and it does fall into a few cliched tropes, but it pulls them off awesomely. The story's not particularly original, but it's done in such a way that it works so well.\nThe art is simply astounding. From the excellent character designs to the unique and crisp mech designs, there's no real flaw in G-L's art of note.\nThe sound is well done, as well. From the\n          \n        very fitting, dramatically done and professional voices, to the impactful sound effects to the amazing music (such as Shoko Nakagwa's opening theme, Sorairo Days), there's no way you won't like the music in this show.\nThe characters are great, but you can see the effect of the whole mecha genre in it. You have the unconfidant kid, the powerful 'older brother' character, the sexy girl, the moe girl, the cute pet, the political mind, and the rest of the army. However, the characters are all very fleshed out and work well. They're very 3 dimensional and don't fall into the same flat patheticness.\nThe anime really shines in its enjoyability, however. The fights are well choreographed, the jokes are well timed, and the speeches are always full of hot-blood and awesome.\nIf you're a mecha fan, you'd do yourself a great disservice by skipping this anime.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=15,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Gurren Lagann can be described in one word: Fun. This show is damn fun. It's a non-stop action show with an alluring plot, a beautiful gritty art style, music that gets your blood pumping, and characters who have the fighting spirit (or should I say spiral?) of champions.\nThe characters are charismatic; I don't see how you can't like them. Kamina has contagious confidence, ambition, and will stop at nothing to achieve his dreams. Simon, on the other hand, has some growing up to do. Kamina being his \"big bro\" helps him grow up as a man and learn how to carry himself and be okay\n          \n        with who he is. I think a lot of people are able to empathize with Simon, learning how to be okay with who you are and learning to reach for the heavens is something we all strive for.\nThe art style is one of my favorites. I think it looks like a mix between Space Dandy and a more vibrant looking Fooly Cooly, to give you an idea. It's just flat-out cool. The style also adds to each fight scene astronomically, enhancing each punch thrown and each kick blocked in order to improve the deliverance of each episode.\nThe music is also phenomenal. I would often find myself humming one particular song when walking to class or when bumming around in my apartment. However, there were a couple tracks in there that felt misplaced, an opera piece being one of them. Luckily, it wasn't played much.\nThe one and only complaint I have is the lack of downtime. Most of the time in shows, there will be maybe one or two episodes where there aren't major plot developments during it. This lets viewers see the characters interact with each other, maybe throw some jokes around, and just see day-to-day life. Unforunately, Gurren Lagann doesn't have anything like that. Most of the show is very serious, but I suppose that goes with its mantra: \"nothing can stop you, keep going until you make it, be yourself, and never give up.\"\nAnyway, give Gurren Lagann a try if you have the time.

I thought i'd let it all sink in a bit before writing a review.\nThe story is gripping from start to finish, with nice twists and embelishments throughout.

And of course everyone's favourite - 'Libera Me' From Hell, the awesome fusion of opera with rap. Who would of thought that would work? 'RAW, RAW, FIGHT THE POWA!'\nThe characters are all very well designed, balanced, and developed. The time-leap which i mentioned really helps to do this. There are surprises, love stories, broken hearts, comings of age and everything you'd expect, perfectly exectued.\nEnjoyment. Well, i'm gonna watch it again soon and i'm itching for a dvd box set! There's not much more to say than that.\nMaybe another reason i enjoyed Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann so much was that it managed to subtley remind me of other anime that i love, without ripping them off. There are obvious parallels with Neon Genesis Evangelion, and of course coming from Gainax, the craziness and animation style reminded me of FLCL. Bits of the soundtrack reminded me of the iconic music from Cowboy Bebop, and of course the whole 'unite' element of fighting took me back to the good old days of Power Rangers.\nAnyway, this anime is definately one for the history books.

The only way I'm able to type this review is because I spend so much time at the computer that I know where all the keys are!\nGurren Lagann isn't an intellectual show. It isn't a show about strategy or any pussy material like that. It's a show packed with pure and overwhelming emotion, passion, and FIGHTING SPIRIT! In other words, it's purely epic.

We meet again!\nThe characters in this show are the straight out Superheroes! And they are probably the best heroes I have ever seen in an anime. The development, especially for Simon, was absolutely beautiful! We've seen the \"shy and pussylike boy evolving into badass and determined man\" trope a lot, even before Gurren Lagann was a thing, but Simon pulls this off with way more impact than any other main character!\nKamina, the most popular character of the series, is like an omnipotent symbol of hope! It's impossible to get more optimistic than this SOB, for he is the epitome of never give up, believe in the me that believes in you! He probably has the most impact in the entire series, directly and indirectly, making him an overall 10/10 character!\nAlso, can we just say that Yoko's character design is just super damn sexy? As the main source of fanservice, Yoko is always a joy for the eyes whenever she had a scene. Not only because of how she looks, but because she is an absolute badass as well! For those who want more Yoko fanservice, look up the music video with her in it! You won't be disappointed ;)\nAnd now for my favorite character of the series, a character that will make some of you people think that I am some stupid hipster! It's Nia! I absolutely loved Nia! Why? Not only is she incredibly adorable and warm hearted, but her way of not understanding anything, yet her ability to piece things together to understand everything was really endearing. It's like she is the least human, yet the most human out of the entire cast!\nTo sum it all up, Gurren Lagann's character cast? You get a stamp of approval!\nEnjoyment: Unmeasurable\nWhat the hell did I just watch? Well, whatever it was, it made me grow 4 inches, gain a badass beard, deepened my voice, and gave me a harem.

If you're anything like me, you probably started with one of the big 3 like Naruto, One Piece, or Bleach and you didn't realize that there are other anime out there. Then your high school friends told you about Sword Art Online or Attack on Titan and suddenly you were HOOKED on anime. But the problem with us is that we started watching anime in a different era where the art is\n          \n        supposed to meet all of our highest expectations, the characters must always be glimmering in badassness, and our enjoyment comes from nothing but those qualities. \n\"Any show that looks old or dates back to before MAYBE 2010 is bad.\"\nWell that's a load of FALSE bullcrap. I KNOW that there are a ton of you out there who have that mentality. I'm telling you right now to change that mentality and open your mind to mothafuckin' TENGEN TOPPA GURREN LAGANN from 2007. \n\nWe're so stuck on shows that are so visually captivating that we forget about the legends that preceded the shows we love today. Here's why I believe us late-blooming anime viewers need to watch Gurren Lagann:\nStory - 8/10\nThe story is honestly pretty interesting. The overall concept of the setting is gold in my opinion. At first, you might be thinking, \"wow, another mecha anime, what's new?\" But this show goes BEYOND any other mecha anime you have ever seen. The are a lot of things in this show that are incredibly wild and unexplained, but you know, you just gotta \"kick reason to the curb\" for a hot second here.\nArt - 10/10\nThis anime was made in 2007 and is way more visually appealing than a lot of anime that has been produced in 2017. Guys, trust me on this. From a simple sunset to a galactic battle, your jaw will drop at the beauty this show presents to you.\nSound - 8/10\nOkay, the OP is really frickin' solid. It's a kickass song for a kickass show. It gets you in that, \"yeah! I can do anything! Dattebayo!\" type of mood where you just feel GOOD. The rest of the OST was also fantastic and it really brings out the emotions you're trying to hide while watching this. I know I cried like a lil' bitch and you will, too. \nCharacter - 10/10\nThe characters are AMAZING. You'd think that with a cast this big, there would be a couple of duds within the group, but honestly, I felt that everyone that was meant to be important, WAS, IN FACT, IMPORTANT. Kamina, the charismatic older brother, doesn't show much development himself, but that's because he is the catalyst for everyone else's development. And he does a damn good job of bringing out the best in others. Simon, the protagonist, WOW. I felt like I was watching my future son grow up into a man. The shit that this boy goes through is just unreal, and his transformation, both physically and mentally, was one of the most notable that I've seen. Even the members of Team Dai-Gurren show some promise as the show goes on. There are so many characters in this show, and I can't talk about them all, but I can say they each have a purpose. \nEnjoyment - 10/10\nYou will cry because you're happy. You will cry because you're mad. You will cry because you're sad. You will cry because you want to frickin' cry, okay. Just cry and bathe in your tears as you watch this masterpiece. \nIf you don't enjoy this show then something is wrong with you. Call the hotline at 1-800-SUCK-MY-ASS for more assistance.\nOverall - 10/10\nAgain, for those of you that have any inhibitions about watching an anime that's older than most, throw those inhibitions aside and give this anime a shot. I promise you won't regret. Tengen Toppa Gurren Laggan is one of the best shows I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot. It is a phenomenal anime that provides you with insane fights of galactic proportions, emotionally taxing stress, comic relief, and moments of wonder and awe. \n-NeoSeoul out-\n"},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    Honestly, this anime started off really good with its first arc (1-16), then went absolutely down hill with its second arc (17-27). Also, this review contains MILD SPOILERS DURING THE CHARACTER SECTION.\nStory (6/10):\nSo the first arc of TTGL has a pretty awesome story. It's basically adventure as they learn new things about Gurren Lagann and defeat enemies. Enjoyable, and although it may not make you think that hard, it has few to no glaring plot holes. I'd honestly give the first arc a 9 or 10 for its story.\nNow the second arc is where things begin to become a bit bad. A lot of the\n          \n        bad aspects of it are because of the characters, but I'll discuss that in the character portion of this review. We basically get about a 5-10 minute summary of a very very different world from which you've watched in the first 16 episodes of this anime, after which all hell breaks loose. During this arc, it seems like the writers just continue to add random obstacles that make no sense, then pull solutions out of their ass. All in all it's a lot more boring than the first arc.\nArt (9/10):\nNot much to say here. Pretty decent art, and the fight scenes are pretty nice to watch in terms of visuals.\nSound (9/10):\nThe soundtrack is pretty good and I was alright with the opening song.\nCharacter (5/10):\nSimon - The main character of TTGL and extremely interesting during the first arc. He goes through a series of transformations, starting off as a wimpy little kid but progressively becoming braver and more determined. However, during the second arc, he becomes completely static as a character. He basically just becomes a guy with huge balls and never changes. I have to admit though, for the second arc, since it was only ten episodes, it would have been a lot harder to get him through decent character development.\nKamina - Not really much to say here. Although he is pretty static as a character, that's what is required since he's basically made as a martyr for the story. He's also a pretty fun character.\nYoko - Literally just loses all purpose at a certain point in the anime and is replaced with Nia. She starts off as an amazingly interesting character, and was definitely my favorite character in the beginning of the series. However, as soon as Nia appears, she practically becomes useless and a minor character who has no impact in the series. Simon's feelings for Yoko seem to vanish as soon as Nia appears (although it could be due to Simon simply honoring Yoko and Kamina's relationship since he died; not really any way to know though since Kamina dying and Nia appearing happen extremely close together). I found it extremely stupid that she got discarded as a character considering she was such a major character before. In addition, during the second arc for some reason she and Kittan seem to have feelings for each other out of nowhere. This is after them barely ever talking to each other (I think they talked to each other maybe 3-5 times previously over the course of 20ish episodes, none of which were slightly important conversations), and not seeing each other for seven years. Literally what happens is Kittan starts staring at her boobs, and somehow from that they start a relationship. I'm pretty certain that the reason they did this was so that they could make Kittan's death more meaningful, which is why I said above that they added random stuff to the story out of nowhere to create obstacles. Yoko's character practically became a joke.\nNia - Actually, a great character. She goes through mild-moderate character development, stays relevant throughout the series, and is pretty interesting.\nMole - I... don't even know. This makes zero sense whatsoever. So the mole started off as simply an animal that kept Simon company. No influence on the story whatsoever, just a comfortable animal that existed. Then, all of a sudden, he produces power nearly equal to Simon's during the second arc to save them, with the explanation that \"somehow it's contact with Simon gave it power\". I'll give the writer's credit for at least trying to explain this, however this is practically deus ex machina. Later on, Mole even turns into a human, for zero purpose whatsoever than to extend the series for about a minute. One of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen.\nEnjoyment (7/10):\nBattle scenes are pretty sweet throughout the series and there are a few laughs here and there. If it weren't for the characters I'd definitely enjoy the series a ton more.\nOverall (6/10):\nA decent series, with the first arc being memorable but the second arc ruining those memories. It's not that bad, but definitely something one shouldn't go out of their way to watch.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I am a bit late to the Gurren Laggen party, having missed the peak of its popularity by almost a decade.  That said, Gurren Laggen (henceforth referred to simply as \"GL\") is an anime that still ranks competively with the best anime coming out today.\nGL is a cathartic anime in that the characters, situations, and events that take place hit all the right notes in the view to make it an overall enjoyable experience.  The characters are really no frills, very little time is wasted with non-essential backstory, and only the most crucial parts of what is needed to endear them to the\n          \n        viewers are explored.  This works very well, as GL has very few \"filler\" episodes, and only one clip-show episode.\nGL also excels at telling a complete story in only 27 episodes (26 if you disregard the clip show).  This is something that happened frequently in late-90s, early-2000s anime, that modern anime should return to.  Too often, anime in the 2010s try to copy the Western trope of the cliffhanger, leaving their stories dangling with many open ends in the hope of securing future seasons.  Often, however, this does not happen and the anime never wraps up its storytelling as a result.  GL, thankfully, does not do this, and completes its entire storyarc within the span on one series.  Are there more stories that could be told in the GL universe? Absolutely, but the series itself is self-contained with no need to explore anything else to be a satisfying experience.\nThe art of GL is also right on point.  At times, the art seems rough, but as the show goes on, these rough moments are shown to be intentional animation choices meant to highlight particularly emotional or tense moments.  Despite what might be considered the grittiness of its story, GL's art is bright and colorful giving its theme of the endurance of the human will a visual medium along with the dialogue and plot.\nNow, that's not to say everything in GL is perfect.  In particular, GL suffers heavily from a trope of early-2000s anime--the first half of the show is radically different in pacing and story than the second half.  Indeed, one could stop at episode 13 and feel as if a complete story has been told, or pick up and start with episode 14 and think they are on episode 1.  This is somewhat problematic because there doesn't feel like much unity between the two halves beyond the theme of the endurance of the human spirit and its ability to overcome.\nAnother problem with the second half of the anime is that it falls into what we might term \"The Dragonball Z Effect\".  The situations become progressively more ridiculous, the enemies progressively more powerful, and the solutions to problems progressively more reliant on deus ex machina solutions (perhaps literally in the case of GL).   While the first half has some of this, it develops a world and philosophy and pretty much sticks too it--unlike the second half which almost feels inconsistent.  Basically, without spoiling anything, the first half champions the simple attitude of belief in oneself and ability of a clear sense of purpose cutting through what is and isn't possible.  This philosophy works well because it means that answers are not necessary because questions aren't asked.  In the second half, however, questions ARE asked, frequently, and the answers become a muddled mix of pseudo-science, gibberish, and philosophical nonsense.  Yes, in the end, the human spirit and sense of self triumph over the need to answer questions, but because the questions are asked (and answered in some way) it leaves the viewer in the dust.  \"Just punch it in the face\" as a way of solving all lives problems doesn't work when you devote so much time to explaining the hows and whys of the mechanics that make the \"punch\" work.  This is GL's greatest weakness, it is trying to be something it isn't, and in the process it becomes a strange mixture of DBZ and NGE that mix about as well as oil and water.\nAll in all, GL is a super fun anime that will keep you hooked from start to finish and likely stay with you for a time afterwards.  It doesn't break any new ground, nor does it challenge any established tropes, if anything it embraces its tropes and blows them over the top, and for the most part it works very well.  The second half is much weaker than the first half, but not enough to ruin the whole experience.  In the end, I give this anime a 9 out of 10 because the first half is a solid 10, and the second half is more of an 8.  \n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    To simply say that this anime series is great...would be a disservice. To simply say that this anime series is great just because it has giant robot with drills...would also be a disservice. No, what makes Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann a true gem is how it manages to combine years of mecha history, surprisingly good story telling, and pure awesomeness. And somehow, against all possibilities yield an epic masterpiece.\nFrom the surface, this series has the typical trappings of good mecha show. The voice acting is rock solid and appropriately bursting with energy. The animation is creative even if occasionally inconsistent. And it has giant robots\n          \n        piloted by passionate badass heroes. Yet what makes Gurren Lagann truly shine is that while it still has the awesome look and feel of a typical idealistic super robot show, it also includes a smart story with likable characters, an awareness of conventions found in anime shows, and meaningful themes.\nAll of the charactera are developed and memorable even at their silliest moments. Initially they come off as typical stock archetypes with Simon being the crybaby, Kamina being the hyperactive big brother, and Rossiu being the emo cynic. However, as the series progresses, each character reveal additional hidden traits and experience character arcs. The seemingly fearless Kamina secretly feels seems moments of terror yet still persists because of Simon. Simon initially was presented as a crybaby and coward who would snap at every setback. However, with enough encouragement from Kamina and Nia, he was able to believe in the ideal version of himself and become a truly confident hero. Even Rossiu, the doubting strawman who seems out of place in a world driven by badass willpower, is shown as a fully developed figure instead of a nagging caricature. Sure he doesn't stick behind Simon yet he still genuinely cares about helping humanity and even expresses remorse for screwing over others. In fact, even Simon still values Rossiu as a human being and is willing to help him in his moment of despair. For all their over the top quirks, the characters still feel relatable and dynamic.\nIn relationship to other mecha series, Gurren Lagann serves as both an homage and a spiritual antithesis to Evangelion and Gundam (note that this reviewer appreciates the works of Anno and Tomino and does not mean to denigrate their positive contributions). Specifically, Lagann counters the elements of despair in Evangelion and death in Universal Century Gundam. Like Evangelion, the heroes fall into moments of despair with Simon and Yoko suffering from self-loathing and low self-esteem. However, unlike Evangelion, these characters were able to bind together and help each other overcome their problems, thus allowing them to deal with further hardships. Like Gundam, many beloved characters are killed off in unexpected moments. However, even when facing their inevitable deaths, each character go out in a blaze of glory, fighting to the last breath and making the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety of all life. Gurren Lagann addresses these issues such that the characters could work around them in an uplifting manner. In other words, it looks at the world in an idealistic half-full view.\nYet ultimately, Gurren Lagann has some very meaningful messages that help viewers. Of course the reoccurring theme is believing in one another. By having trust and faith in even the least likely person, the heroes are able to overcome obstacles and defy the odds. Given how cynicism runs rampant in many recent works, this theme really add assurance and gives confidence. Yet another important message is how to overcome obstacles to become a true hero. In one of the earlier arcs, Simon falls into emotional despair yet his friends sans Kamina only care about forcing him into Kamina's role, regardless of the emotional strain. However, after meeting the compassionate Nia, Simon realizes that he is not the same person as Kamina and found comfort in a moment of despair. Such that this a gotcha moment: You cannot make someone overcome hardships by force and give them unreasobale expectations. A person can achieve greatness only when given loving support and an identity tailored to themselves. Of course, all of these messages are best summed up by Simon's boast after his character development: \"If you're gonna dig, dig to the heavens. No matter what's in my way, I won't stop! Once I've dug through — it means that I've won! Just who the hell do you think I am? I'm Simon. I'm not my Bro! I'M ME!! Simon the Digger!\"\nIn the end Gurren Lagann works because of how it is an idealistic series that leaves one feeling much better. While the series has awesome action and presentation, much of the idealistic experience comes from its smart story. Each character experiences moments of self-doubt and emotional hardships yet they experience growth and overcome these obstacles. It counters genuine hardships and setbacks one would expect from mecha anime. Yet most importantly, its take away morals can help leaving people rejuvenated and optimistic. In a turbulent and uncertain world, Gurren Lagann provides a genuinely refreshing and uplifting experiences that helps viewers tackle problems in life.\n        "},

One of the most formulaic shows I have ever seen, the same thing happens every episode. Simon screams loudly, his magical spiral thingy goes round and he pulls a drill shaped dildo out of laganns ass and beats the enemy. Next week the same thing happens but the enemy is bigger, so he has to scream even louder and drill a bit harder. Congratulations you just finished\n          \n        the first half of gurren lagann (with the major spoiler omitted) \nNow admittedly I've only seen half of it but I can't see it changing that much given how formulaic it is. Sure what seems like a major upset happens a quarter of the way in but it only changes the show for the worse and it has very little effect on the direction of the main plot. \nOn the plus side the art and music are fairly decent and a few of the characters aren't stereotypical for the genre but it doesn't make up for the boring, repetitive  plot.

		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="                          \n    Not sure where to begin with this. It's frustrating to see such a bad anime get the massive amount of hype it does. Something like Shingeki No Kyojin at least has some merit, but in this case, there's absolutely nothing here to speak of. The plot itself starts out alright, nothing too bad, but not great. After a certain character death, things take a turn for the worst. There's a timeskip here and that's when the shit really starts to stink.\nThe series begins taking itself seriously, but there's nothing to be taken seriously. The characters range from bland to annoying and the fights are good\n          \n        to bad, but more on the bad side as they're just meaningless explosions anywhere which are very reminiscent of Super Sentai episodes. Isn't the point of one of these anime to have fun? Well, I had none. Bear in mind, this is a very docile review, as I could delve into what makes the final episodes overwhelmingly horrendous, but I won't for the sake of time. \nAll in all, this is trash. Over-hyped, and severely over-milked garbage that can only be recommended to the utmost of masochists, or the very simple minded. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    When I watch anime, I want shows or movies to be about epic adventures that makes you forget about your boring life or have deep involving stories with good themes, complex characters and messages or shows that go beyond the laws of physics to deliver incredible action-packed moments. Nowadays, new anime that is coming out is always about cute girls doing school stuff or just a remake of a popular show. There's barely originality in the anime industry and thanks to the show K-On!, it seems that we will see more moe-moe trash for this year. \nIf there's one show that helped me kept my\n          \n        faith in anime, it has to be Gurren Lagann. At first, I was not interested at all in this show since it does look ridiculous, but a friend recommend me this show and I decided to give the show a chance. After watching all 27 episodes of this show, I have to say that Gurren Lagann is... is.... *sigh* Screw it. Gurren Lagann is fucking amazing!\nYes, I just said that out loud. Gurren Lagann is amazing. I love the premise, I love the characters, I love the creative world and it's mythos, I love everything about this show. For me, Gurren Lagann is 10X times better than Neon Genesis Evangelion, where that show has a pretentious ending that made no goddamn sense and a protagonist that made me wanna choke his throat. Yes, it is an important anime, but it is an overrated garbage of a show.\nThe story takes place underground. Why? Because the surface is ruled by The Spiral King, who forced humankind to live underground for all eternity. Under the surface, people called diggers must make new pathways to expand their villages in order for more people to live and one of these diggers is a kid named Simon, who's accustomed to do his job and live underground, but his friend Kamina is tired of living underground and wants Simon's help to get him to the surface. After a failed attempt that gets Kamina locked up. a giant mecha head appears from the surface and starts attacking the village, but Simon shows Kamina the giant mecha head that he found while he was digging and they later activate the mecha with the spiral necklace that Simon found in the first episode. After they defeated the mecha head with the help of Yoko, a sexy chick who knows how to fight with style, they go to the surface, as they admire through the beautiful blue skies and the open vast land of the surface. Now Kamina and Simon must lead a rebellion to defeat The Spiral King and conquer the surface, so that all humans can live better lives.\nAt first, the story of Gurren Lagann is ridiculous and beyond ordinary, but that is what makes the story so damn unique. It has an incredible unique world filled with it's own history, legends and mythos that it's hard to not get invested in the story. It's a story about humanity's determination to make a change into their race and learn to become stronger, so we can lead our loved ones to safer and better lives. It also contains unique twists and major emotional moments that have a huge impact into it's large cast of characters. \nThe characters are strong and enjoyable. Kamina is simply a great character and yes, he shouts a lot of bad speeches, but he convinces the humans to rise up and take back their planet and quite frankly, It is quite amazing on how he pulled it off. Simon is also a good character as he learns to believe in not only in Kamina, but himself and throughout the series, he becomes more mature and stronger than ever before. Every character that gets introduced in the first half of the series goes through mayor changes and I will not spoil it for those who haven't watched the show yet, but all in all, the story has a lot of unique setting and mythos and a huge cast of lovable and complex characters.\nThe action in Gurren Lagann is beyond insane and breaks all the rules of mecha shows. Logic? On vacation. Realism? Nowhere to be seen. Deus Ex Machina? Oh you're swimming at it! You're swimming it in space and your physics? FUCK YOUR PHYSICS!! God I love that line from JesuOtaku. The action goes full-throttle and it keeps getting better and better the further you get into the show. Planets used for throwing at your enemies, the robot Gurren Lagann getting stronger and bigger the more it transforms, it is just mind-blowing that you will crave for more. The animation by GAINAX is amazingly detailed and while there are parts where the animation does get sloppy, the beautiful art and fast-paced colorful visuals. The animation gets even better in the final episodes and boy, prepare for a giant orgasm of colors when the final battle hits on episode 27.\nThe dub for the show is excellent. While Kyle Herbert doesn't give an over the top performance to Kamina like in the Japanese version, it still fits and he gives more human emotion to the character in the English version. Yuri Lowenthal does a perfect job on his performance as Simon, Steve Blum was just akward, but hilarious as Leeron with his crazy sexuality charm  into the character and overall, it is a perfect dub alongside FMA, Cowboy Bebop, Black Lagoon and so on. The music is exciting and gigantic. It offers a fair share of music, ranging from orchestrations to hard rock to a little bit of hard techno and the opening theme \"Sorairo Days\" will get your excitement hyped up until the next episode to come. \nIs there anything in this show that I don't like? No, I don't. Gurren Lagann is a show that has something for everyone. It has a great story, a memorable cast of characters, interesting mythos about these Spirals, Anti-Spirals and the reasons for humans to be underground, the animation of sheer quality and mind blowing action. For me, this show has everything on why i love to watch anime and no small flaw will stop me from enjoying this epic show.\nDo I need to say more on why I still love this show? Just go to Amazon.com, buy Gurren Lagann the complete collection and see the damn show. It's an amazing show that no anime or mecha fan should miss. I hope GAINAX can re-invent themselves again with another crazy show that defies everything that we know about anime. For me, Gurren Lagann and FLCL are one of GAINAX's true works of art and truly represent what the studio really are. Forget Neon Genesis Evangelion, go watch Gurren Lagann!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Every one in awhile an anime comes along that is so game changing, so heart wrenching, and so awesome, that it deserves an absolute perfect score. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (TTGL) is that anime. \nThe story itself is one that draws on a number of traditional ideas, such as the young hero who must come to terms with himself in order to accomplish his goals. It is an engrossing and wrenching story that leaves you feeling like you need to demand more, and no matter how badly you would like to change the endings you know that you cannot, because they are perfect the way\n          \n        they are. The story left me breathless, unable to come to terms with the fact that the show I had just watched was over. It is easy to start TTGL and watch the entire show in a single day. The story draws upon all of your human instincts and emotions and centers them into a single show that you cannot take your eyes off of. The story forces you to feel emotions that you had not expected to feel. You come to love the characters and the show because they portray something that is so human while being so absurd that you need to love them. They bring the word \"awesome\" to an entirely different level while connecting to our human instincts on a base level.\nThe art for TTGL is interesting because, while it uses traditional anime styling, it also has a very original, sketch-artist look to a lot of the scenes. The show has its roots in hip-hop, rock, and folk, and every scene of the show lets you feel what the author wanted you to feel. The sound and art of TTGL draw you in even more to what the characters are doing and how the show is progressing. The show, especially in the later episodes, becomes something that can only be described with the word \"Awesome\", meaning every definition. It's a show that immerses you in itself and refuses to let go. \nI would recommend this show to anyone, be they just starting to get into anime or seasoned veterans. Fans of every genre can come to love Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. It is truly an anime worth of 10/10. \n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="                          \n    It was about a year ago since I watched the series and only now have I decided to leave my review. I know that I will get bashed most likely but hey! That's my opinion!\nAs you can see I gave this series only 5 but before I mention negatives, I'll start with positives that allowed me to give this series 5 and not lower.\nIn comparison to many shounen out there, characters actually DIE here! Be you a good or a bad guy, you won't be saved like for example in Bleach. Series also have some unexpected deaths which will get you suprised.\nLots of action, constantly\n          \n        something is exploding and plot does not stop, it keeps moving. Once again Bleach will be an opposite example where fights lasted for years and barely moved a plot at all.\nLots of characters, some do have interesting and unique personalities.\nA time skip with all grown up characters, you can see what happend to the characters later after they had won the war.\n\nNow comes the time for minuses...\nDespite having lots of action, it also most of the time has NO LOGIG what so ever! Things just happen out of nowhere with nothing to back up the outcome! A small robot suddenly transforms into a giantic space ship and so on, just how did it fit in there?! There is a lot more ridiculness like that! None of the actions have logic behind them (I mean the way fights go, not the reason to why fights happen in the first place), it just happens for the sake to happen and to provide something huge with huge explosions! If that's all you care about... well you will love it then.\nThe fact that there are lots of characters is also a minus because the biggest part of them has no personality at all, they are just stupid and plain, and know only how to press \"FIRE!\" button. How some of them managed to take big positions in councel and stuff is beyond me.\nThe famouse Kamina was a bad ass yet at the same time he did things without thinking and obviously payed the price for that.\nThe famouse Yoko... is there anything good about her except her looks? And she is freaking 14 at the beginning of the series! Yes she did have some nice and cool moments but most of the time she didn't do anything outstanding. Though in comparison to many, she actually had personality and brains which could think off far more useful things than just press \"FIRE\" button all the time so I guess she is not that bad.\nThe famouse time skip... also happened to be a minus... for one, characters and world had developed WAY TOO MUCH in such a short time! It is simply impossible! The plot did try to give explanation to such sudden change but it still does not fit right.\nA lot of characters personalities had drasticly changed and there was never given a real explanation as to why that happened, at least not for everyone. Like for example one of 3 sisters who was all cheerful suddenly became all cold, why? I can't find logical explanation to such change myself.\nAnimation... No, not my cup. For one a lot of characters simply look ridiculous, their faces tend to get disordered and sometimes animation is simply roigh! It doesn't happen always, but most of the time it just looked plain. The only well animated things were probably explosions and some details in Mechas.\nDid I enjoy the series over all? Sorry, but no. There are some scenes I would like to re-watch but over all it is just a waste of time. How this series managed to get to the top is beyond me.\nIf creators tried to give at least some logic to how things were happening, it could have been good then.\nHowever, if you just want to see mindlees explosiots without caring why it really happens, well I guess you'll love it then as many others did.\nBut if you want to see something with logic behind, to look at least a bit realistic... forget it, this series will never meet your expactations.\n        "},

I can put my disbelief on hold to an extent, but you'd have to really be able to do it to buy all the things they try to tell you. Also, I don't buy the ending, not just because of the obvious thing if you've watched it, though that is one of the reasons. I could go into a long rant about it but this isn't the place for it.\nArt - 8\nI don't really have much to\n          \n        say on this category, it wasn't bad, but didn't wow me. It was very colorful though.\nSound -  6\nThis is where Gurren Lagann suffered to me. Very few tracks stood out to me, and I didn't get as pumped by the OST as other animes.\nCharacter - 8\nWell, the characters were all pretty straight forward, I would say Simon's really the only one with evident character growth. Kamina annoyed the hell out of me. Yoko's kind of the poster girl with a large rifle and loses purpose other than eye candy later on.\nEnjoyment - 9\nThe show moved at a fairly rigorous pace so it kept the enjoyment factor up. The show's all about the indomitable human spirit, and that messages resonates with a lot of viewers.\nOverall - 8\nI don't think I can give the show higher than an 8. I honestly don't know why this show is so highly rated relative to other shows I've seen that I would rate equally or higher. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching it and it's not a bad show, but there were just too many things that bugged me about it.\n        "},

This anime impacted me so much, I extremely enjoyed it. Which was to my surprise, because I really dislike mecha anime, but this anime was an exception. \nStory: 10/10 \nIt's hard to talk about the story without giving away spoilers, so i'll try to cover this as basic as I can. The story is really special. It'll take you on a journey, the growth and evolution of the species known as man kind. By the end of the anime, the characters have undergone so much\n          \n        growth, it's like their totally different people. The amount of emotion in this anime is out standing, it lives on it emotion. The emotion is what powers the anime, the growth, its what makes it so great. Anyone who has watched this anime knows what i'm referring to. Personally, this anime left me feeling changed.\nArt: 8/10\nThe art in this anime is good. It's really detailed during action scenes! But, with that being said, there are certain times when the animation does seem a little poor. Just minor moments with characters, it'll lack detail.Nothing drastic at all. It seems to me as if the animation got better as the anime went on, but that's just my opinion. \nSound: 9/10\nThe sound speaks for itself, there's nothing to be said here really. The theme song is enjoyable, the music within the anime itself was good as well. I have no complaints about the music. That also goes for voice actors, they were all perfect too.\nEnjoyment: 9/10\nThis anime was extremely enjoyable. It made me feel every emotion at lease once. It was really well planned out, a lot of work must have went into it to make it as good as it is. The only complaint I have is that the anime doesn't show its outstanding potential in the earlier episodes. Don't get me wrong, they were really good! But for me, I just thought it was a typical \"good mecha\" up until a certain point, then my opinion changed. It didn't get on the road to \"outstanding\" until around episode 10-12. Once again, this is just how I felt personally.\nOverall, I'm obviously going to have to give it a 10/10! I don't like giving out 10's to anime's so loosely, but this anime definitely deserves it. You really thing i'd give it anything below? Who the hell do you think I am!? \nCheers, hope this helps.\n        "},

There's always something to learn and a message to be analyzed and understood and perhaps even put it to good use in your daily life. This is, not so much a review as it is a personal story.\nWhen I first was told about Gurren Lagann I didn't think it'd be anywhere near as good as any sol, drama, comedy, etc. anime I had already seen so I was extremely skeptical about what GL had in it that\n          \n        so many people hyped it as hard and high on the pedestal it's oftenly put up. I mean, mechas, a kid, boobs, action, it can't possible be anything near as moving and satisfying emotion wise. We have seen so many action/mecha animes that this can't be something interesting.\nTo be completely honest and give you a sense of how wrong I was, I started watching it on a Monday after work and university at 21:00 and finished it on Wednesday in the middle of the office at 17:00. The only thing that I have so hardcorely binge watched is Love Live!, which I think it sill is the best thing ever, but barely a hair's width of losing to GL.\nDo not let the images fool you, this is not your common anime. Yes it has mechas, yes it has random tiddies, yes it has ridiculous action scenes, yes it seems cliche. It has everything you'd expect out of your typical shounen, but it goes way more deep and beyond the barriers of what shounen offers to people. This is the anime that turns boys into men so much as the bar mitzvah is for jewish people.\nIt's the story of a boy looking to become a man, looking for his own destiny and fighting his way through life and all that comes with it. It's a story about strength, about perseverance and hardwork, about not giving up your dreams and never give in to any situation no matter how hard and thick the wall between you and your destiny is. Gurren Lagann is the perfect anime for newcomers as well as veterans in anime. All characters have their own story and purpose, all characters have a personality and something to share. Everything in the anime happens for a reason and it's all for the ultimate goal of getting the message across \"your destiny is in your hands, become a man, decide for yourself and never let anything or anyone tell you otherwise\". It sounds cliche and overused, but in all honesty, this is the only the second anime that has managed to get that message across to my head (the first being LL!).\nThe experience that Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is can't be described further in words, it's one of those things that's like \"see it for yourself and you'll understand exactly what I'm talking about\". \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Gurren Lagann just so happens to be my favorite anime of all time. Therefore, my review may be a little biased, but I'll Give it a go anyways.\nStory: 9/10\nThe story starts off with a very odd scenario of a boy and his friend who live in an underground Village. The boy, Simon, is a digger, he digs tunnels throughout the ground using his drill to help the city expand. His friend, Kamina, is a free spirit who refuses to believe the stories that the elders of the village. They insist that there is nothing above or below the village but dirt. However, Kamina knows otherwise.\n          \n        He has been on the surface of the world with his father, and insists that he will go to the surface again. He is constantly causing trouble and being punished for it. However, one day, while digging, Simon comes across a very odd robotic head. The necklace he wears seems to resonate with the robotic head. Within a short amount of time, the ceiling of the village collapses. A gigantic robot breaks into the village and starts to reek havoc upon its citizens. Kamina and Simon try and stop it, and are helped by an attractive young sniper from the surface, named Yoko. Once they defeat the robot, Simon, Kamina, And Yoko venture to the surface and journey to Yoko's village. There they find out that humans are constantly under attack from mutant beast men and their gigantic robots. From this point on the story starts to increase exponentially with bigger and better robots, enemies and allies, until the final climactic battle to end it all. However, I won't spoil the ending for you. Overall, the story is much different from any other anime I have seen. At first it may seem very monster of the week, but it does so in a very unique and dramatic way. A large portion of the story focuses on fighting spirit, a combination of determination and willpower. The characters use this fighting spirit to unlock their true power and defeat their enemies. And let me tell you, the fighting spirit of the show carries over and makes you very, very pumped. In my opinion, Gurren Lagann's story deserves a 9/10 for its uniqueness and intensity.\nArt: 9/10\nGurren Lagann has a unique, colorful art style that is on hand hand, relatively retro, and very modern at the same time. The show's art is a big part of what I liked about it. It was very robust, intense and unique. Other than episode 4 that is, which had a different animator and lacked the same flare as the rest of the show. In my opinion, Gurren Lagann's art deserves a 9/10 for its colorfulness, and its unique and intense style.\nSound: 9/10\nGurren Lagann's soundtrack is overall, quite good. It isn't anything special, as I myself can hardly remember the opening or closing songs of the show, even with how much I enjoyed it. There is however one song that stands out. Libera me from hell. It's iconic \"Row, Row, fight the power!\" is enough to energize and inspire even the laziest person to get up off their feet and be active. Although it is used very rarely in the first half of the show, and only moderately in the second half, it is used at the perfect times. Especially during important battles. The voice acting is extremely high quality and robust, And is much better than average, in both the dub and sub. In my opinion, Gurren Lagann's sound deserves an 9/10 for its above average voice acting and soundtrack, and the standout song, Libera me from hell. \nCharacters: 10/10\nGurren Lagann's characters are what really makes the show shine. They are all unique, and yet, all relatable in various ways. From their motives to their behavior, each and every one of them is given so much depth that you can't help but miss them when they're gone. And oh boy do they go. Gurren Lagann is very Goerge R.R. Martin-esque. It is not afriad to kill off your favorite characters and it will do so. It will make you feel things you though an anime could never make you feel. Because of the characters aforementioned relatableness, you actually feel saddened when they're gone, much like the other characters do. Gurren Lagann is a show with actual sacrifices. The characters have to give up everyone they know and love to complete their goal. The loss of their fellow characters affects them deeply and though at first they may grieve, they use the loss of their friends as their drive and motivation to keep moving. They take their grief and turn it into fuel, into fighting spirit, to help them destroy their enemies. The show makes you feel the same way, wanting all of the enemies to be destroyed. But then, the show turns you on your heads by examining the motives and motivations of the \"bad guys\" and makes you relate to and feel for them as well. By the end your heart is ripped into shreds, but satisfied at the same time. In my opinion Gurren Lagann's characters are what makes the show as great as it is and deserve a perfect 10/10.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nWhat can I say, I'm a sucker for action. I love it. And Gurren Lagann has action. A lot of it. Very intense and extreme action, that makes you feel as if you were a part of it. The show makes you want to grab the nearest evil-doer and pummle him. It makes you want to get off your ass and do something with your life. It makes you want to fight. But not fight just to fight, fight for something, and to use your fighting spirit, your will, your determination to accomplish your goals. I massively enjoyed Gurren Lagann and I hope you do too. My enjoyment of Gurren Lagann was a perfect 10/10. \nOverall: 10/10\nGurren Lagann is in my opinion a creative masterpiece. It is brilliantly animated and written, and has inspired me like no other anime has. Therefore, I give it an overall score of 10/10.\n        "},

Shunned by peers and scared of his surroundings, Simon grew up timid and lacking confidence, with his only friend being Kamina, an ambitious and hotheaded young man who dreams\n          \n        of going up the \"surface\".\nOne day, while digging deeper to expand his city, Simon comes across a small robot that looks like a face. On his way to show Kamina the robot, an even bigger robot crashes down onto their home, and girl named Yoko comes to fight it. Using the small robot (dubbed \"Lagann\") to fight the bigger robot (called a \"Gunmen\"), Simon discovers that he has to channel his determination into something called Spiral Energy to power Lagann. After defeating the Gunmen, Simon, Kamina, and Yoko shoot up to the surface, going to fight Lordgenome, and Simon learns what it takes to become a man and a hero.\nArt\nGurren Lagann uses a very gritty art style to identify itself, which can be seen best in its eyecatches, which have become iconic to the series. For a series that aired in 2007, the show holds up very well and can be compared to shows that aired nearly a decade later. In contrast to Evangelion's infamous budget shortage, Gurren Lagann consistently pumps out top-notch animation and graphics, and they serve the battles well.\nSound\nGurren Lagann has some pretty iconic music to go with it, and almost all of it emphasizes the show's hot-blooded over-the-top nature. Themes like Viral's leitmotif \"Nikopol\", the triumphant \"Pierce the Heavens with your Drill!\", and the pre-asskicking opera rap \"'Libera Me' from Hell\" will stay in your head for a long time.\nEnjoyment\nGurren Lagann has a very, extremely, hot-blooded, over-the-top, and in your face style .Kamina exemplifies this the best, as his hammy attitude and iconic quotes make him a rather popular character. It takes usual negative tropes, deus ex machina and asspulls, and makes them endearing to the point where they actually make the story better. \nThe real meat of the show, however, is Simon's development as a character. Over the course of the story, he grows from an intimidating Shinji Ikari-like character to a brave and determined beacon of hope to his friends. It takes tragedy to kickstart his growth, but it pays off and he is a shining example of an unlikely hero. \nAnother gripping aspect is the overarching message of going beyond the impossible. The aforementioned deus ex machina and asspulls are utilized through Spiral Energy, and the characters' drive to reach their goals turns these seemingly bad tropes into a reason to hope they show up. \nWhat makes Gurren Lagann unique from other anime is the passion it possesses. From every scene, you can tell that the creators, the voice actors, and the rest of the cast put a lot of emotion into their work, and it pays off. \nCons\nMy only real problem with the show is that many characters in the series never change as characters. They exist with little purpose, and it's easy to forget their names.\nAnother problem people have with the story is the arc in the beginning of the latter half of the series, but I found it to be an interesting clash of ideals.\nConclusion\nVery rarely does an anime designed with so much mindlessness and bad plot devices end up as a gripping tale of mind-shattering heroism, battles of unimaginable scale, and overt passion. While not as mind-screwing as its predecessor, Gurren Lagann delivers enjoyment of galactic proportions, and is sure to bring fun to anyone who watches it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    Ill just get straight to the point; Gurren Lagann does a lot of things right and wrong. This show can sort of be described as eating a peach; colorful, thick, and tasty on the outside, until you hit the pit. The longer you eat the peach, the less of it there is to enjoy, until you're just holding the cruddy pit and start to realize just how messy it all was. You enjoyed the first part, but that end is hard to swallow.\nTo truly analyze Gurren Lagann I did include some spoiler information, but for the record, major spoilers are marked. \nGurren Lagann is a\n          \n        show about total human triumph in the face of any odd through sheer willpower and pure masculinity, with enough explosions to power the Sun and enough fanservice to possibly turn a few people. And while this sounds like the brain child of all shounen, Gurren Lagann fully admits to its ridiculousness. It’s a parody of its brethren, mecha or no, with its vast amounts of fanservice, ridiculous character, and deus ex machina moments. Gurren Lagann is 'Go Big or Go Home' to a tee, with a serious quote of the show being 'Just kick logic out and do the impossible'! It sells itself off of being self-aware and ultimately just telling a good story with a ton of cool looking robots, space, and explosions and a message to never give up.\nIts very tasty and fun and has lots going for it, and Ill build up the specific parts of the show I enjoyed and then subsequently tear them down as well at the end, sort of like the show does for itself. The peach, and the pit.\nHit 1: The design. Im talking about everything from character design, mecha design, explosion design, background design, all of it is pulled off flawlessly*. No, its not the most gorgeous anime youre ever going to see, thats for sure, but the art style in itself is still something that is fantastic. All the mechas give off their own sense of personality, all the characters are well defined, have every hair color under the rainbow, and dont come off as overly stereotypical (yes, predictable, but at least here you can think of them beyond The Purple Haired One), plus fight scenes and explosions are all done well, even if there are a HELL of a lot of them. The liberties they took in their art style and even the difference between their characters is really well executed. Aesthetically, it has originality, to a degree that may bother some even, but I wouldn’t say its fair to call it bad. Its just classic Gainax.\n*excluding episode 4\nHit 2: Another aspect that can be applauded is the sense of scale. We're talking GALAXY SHATTERING scale here. In Gurren Lagann, there are four arcs, a pair of 8 episodes in length in the beginning, and a pair of fivers following it, and each catering to a specific character. Through the course of 27 episodes, the show follows Team Gurren, from its humble beginnings to god-only-knows where it will take them once they go from there sad little underground village to the mythical 'Surface' and beyond. There is a true sense of journey, conflict, and arrival with each subsequent boss, base, or arc, in such a way that its exciting to see the changes that take place with each new beginning. Its not even that some huge reveal is made at the end of each arc, but instead great shifts occur whenever the characters accomplish their goals, creating something that rolls over into the subsequent arcs. It also holds a sense of consistency within the arcs as to when they will begin and end, and who is the focus, and what is going on, so you never felt as if one particular section is too drawn out. You go on a journey from one tiny little underground village to a bigger village to a huge base to an even bigger base to the whole continent to the moon etc etc. Witnessing said journey is one of the greatest aspects of the show because its constantly providing something new instead of taking place in just one city, school, or area, and it pulls it off without ever losing sight of previous experiences. Gurren Lagann doesn’t forget where its been. Most settings are not simply brought to the table for one episode and then discarded as the team makes its way. Instead, their experiences and triumphs and feelings follow them on their journey, symbolized in how the team constantly grows, from just the two main characters, to three, to five, and then so on. Events that happen early in the show have a very lasting impact, right up until the end. Even the few episodic instances feel like a well-deserved respites before the journey of Gureen Lagann continues.\nMy final positive is something that I cannot go without talking about, but contains major spoilers. \n*SPOILERS START HERE*\nHit 3: Kamina's death stands as the best executed death of a character I have witnessed thus far (or at least, at the beginning of an anime. Ending deaths hold different weight and intentions). He's not even that great of a person: overly cocky, nonsensical, always putting on a tough guy act. He raised some serious death flags when he made certain promises to Yoko, as well as all the times he said 'I'd be dead now if I didnt have Simon', which is exactly what happened. So its not as if it was uncalled for or shocking. On the contrary, you could just see, tell, feel how much the rest of the team needed him. This death wasnt just an 'Okay, we lost another one. Better move on' moment. Even without Yoko and Simon going into some serious depression, you still could understand what losing someone like that meant for the rest of Team Gurren, and whenever someone said 'That Kamina was one hell of a guy' or 'We're not the same without him', you, or at least I, \nas a watcher, seriously understood that. Not having the Kamina antics and someone constantly yelling to go do the impossible in the way he did changed the dynamic a whole lot. Sure, Simon and the gang can all yell about thinking about who the hell they are and Simons drill breaking through stuff, but no one was ever going to do it exactly like Kamina, with the same audacity and truly self-righteous tone. Whenever Kamina was quoted, it was a memorial to him, not just a battlecry. Simon was apprenticed to him, the one destine to become little Kamina, but even the show recognized that Simon was his own character, not meant to be just a Kamina stand in. And thats what made his death a lasting impact instead of just a couple episode twinge. If Simon had just become Kamina again, the death would have only been for shock value, and then I wouldnt be talking about it here at all.\nNo, the Kamina death showed what death is ACTUALLY like for those involved, in an immediate fashion. For a show that rarely got serious, this section was one that managed to someone not feel out of place. Its possible because it provides a certain sense that, instead saying even overcoming death is possible, it draws a line in the sand. Its not going to joke about death. 'Everyone dies' it says 'No matter how brave, cowardly, flashy, needed or hated, small or big, you will die. And real emotions come with that.' Then itll go right on back to being over the top, like its good at. But in our minds, we all know that within all the crazy is a little grain of seriousness, sort of like that guy who usually just jokes around and has a good time, but can gets really down to earth when shit gets real. Or maybe thats just another stereotype. Who knows? HEY LOOK, MORE ExPlOSiOnS!\n*SPOILERS END HERE*\nAlso its fair to note the very real grieving processes of certain characters, which is also a respectful nod to the producers, and how the show does keep consistent motifs, like Simon being the brains/head with Lagann and Kamina being the body with Gurren, aka the legs that help propel Simon, and then all the drill business, but that in particular is something I cant applaud as much. I could spend a more indepth analysis of those aspects as well, but Id feel like I was beating a dead horse at that point.\nBecause Gurren Lagann is split into two parts, Im equally splitting my opinion of it. The first half, episodes 1-16, is great. An anime that manages to be both entertaining and hold serious value. The parody is great, the action is great, the moment to moment feeling is great. Episodes 17-27 are a different story, both literally and figuratively. The second half pushes the antics a bit too far, when it really could have just stopped while it was ahead: \nStrike 1: First off: The time skip. Totally fine. Great even. It makes sense to have everyone grow up and progress for things to really move forward. Everything slows down and it becomes sort of , dare I, serious. Certain events happen that the show may start taking itself more serious, by turning this show of pure mecha into a pseudo political drama. I mean, THATS A BIG CHANGE, but if everything moves in that direction, and it was built up so the timeskip was expected, it works out. Serious flaws in design are brought up, like the old Super Save Everyone Six team (remember the six guys that all got original looking Gundam and somehow survive every battle but have the emotional depth of a high school Slice of Life? Im calling them the SSS for short now) are now the heads of government? And how Simon obviously misses being able to just fly around and beat stuff up in Gurren Lagann, and now they have to be all 'responsible' and shit? And Rosio becoming the only responsible one in the bunch, and thus sort of looking like an ass most of the time? Things happen that point toward getting to blow everything up as NOT the answer.\nLets take, for instance, the new super robot enemies that come through. While everyone else just tries to be calm and assess the situation, Simon just barges in and destroys the thing in the only way he knows how, with his Giga drill move, something that this time which to blow up half the city (ironically, explosions are now just working against him). The point of the new enemy type came across as a sign; a sign that said the old ways arent going to work the same.  Or the fact that everyone is WEARING CLOTHES NOW? Seriously, the fact everyones chest is now covered up held some serious symbolism, right?\nNO. IM WRONG. Because within the next two episodes of the Kamikaze enemies, the show uses LOGIC to make is so that OH NOW WE JUST SHOOT THEM WITH SUPER BULLETS AND MAKE THEM EXPLODE WITHIN THIS FIELD THING! Everythings fine! Oh and Nia? Lets just screw that with some ANTI SPIRAL LOGIC N' SHIT! LOOK! YOKOS BOUNCING JUGS HAVE RETURNED! Within six episodes, everythings just back to exploding and having a good time!\nSo what was the point of all the melodrama from before? \nNo really, this is a fatal flaw in thematics. YES, that arc was probably one reason that people liked it even more, because of that one arc that posed a serious question of mortality and should one person be able to choose for the lives of thousands. Except, OH WAIT, YOU DONT HAVE TO MAKE ANY CHOICES WITH THE POWER OF GURREN LAGANN ON YOUR SIDE! Seriously, it was like the producers realized nothing had exploded in the length of the attention span of the average ten year old, and so they just went back to what they were doing before.\nStrike 2: And when I say  it goes back to doing exactly what it did before, I mean almost EXACTLY what it did before. Once Simon is broken out of jail, it feels like the entire second arc is sort of just put on repeat just Plus Older and Plus Space.\nLets take it from that first space battle. The team is ambushed on their aircraft carrier by two incredibly large and menacing other ships, and thousands of smaller enemy ships spring out and attack, so the team and the SSS go and fly through with minor casualties while Simon has to sit back for a bit to charge up to transform. Oh no, the team is losing strength! Good thing Simon turns into an even larger Gurren just in time and DRILLS!, saving everyone! Then they go and face off with something that looks creepily like a face and has a bunch of oh look little face looking goons to over power the team. So the team and the SSS go and fly through with momentarily minor causalities while Simon has to sit back and charge up and transform. Oh no, the team is losing strength! Good thing Simon transforms just in time to make their imminent deaths meaningful! And now the team goes and faces off with the final boss over the fate of the world. \nThe biggest differences are how the whole team fights together for the final boss instead of it just being Simon, but the fact still remains that the final blow is also delivered in the exact same manner as before. Oh and boo hiss on the filler instances of them falling into a black hole or frozen in time. While interesting, those scenes only filled gaps in space so the producers were not making the EXACT same show. But seriously, what was even the POINT of the mole being transforming? Instances like that failed to add to the show but instead literally wasted time and characters to a black void of meaninglessness. They fight two larger beings, get bigger, win, go to the second to last large boss, millions of little mechas, get bigger, win, get bigger, and then fly into the final boss. The end.\nWhat did the final arc add to the show that the first didn't, besides more explosions? \nOh, well at least Simon gets his girl in the-\n*SPOLIERS BEGIN AGAIN*\nStrike 3:  If Kamina is one of the best executed deaths in anime, Nia is one of the cheapest ending deaths I know. How can I say that? you may ask. 'Nia's death adds a price to be paid to the entire sequence of events, giving it a deeper meaning and more importance' you may say. And to that I argue: How? For a show that is hell-bent on optimism and has already thrown away multiple lesser characters to its 'cause', what is the meaning of Nia literally fading away besides attempting half-assedly to give the story a grittier ending. Sure sure sure, price to pay, but in what instance was it ever even foreshadowed that Nia's energy ever required the Anti-Spiral's existence? Plot quote all you want, but there was no legitimate build up to her death, and instead a cop out write-in explained away by insufficient logic by the show. There's a HUGE difference from a show building up and foreshadowing the death of a character and then the same show just forcing it upon us without a second thought. The producers obviously knew how to create a meaningful relationship with characters and establish a clean death scenario that leaves a lasting impression. So there is no excuse for the low quality execution of Nia's passing. It's like watching your very well trained dog pee all over your carpet. You know it knows better, but it does so anyway.\nThe major flaw I'm trying to point out, amidst my possible fan-boyish rage, that Nia's death was a thematic disaster. The entire point of their journey, and the only reason that it was accomplished it in the first place, was because Simon was attempting to save Nia. Besides saving humanity, a theme that wouldn't necessarily have carried the show considering its cliché nature, the end goal was to reunite with Nia. We are given the optimistic wedding scene practically immediately following the triumphant return AND THEN-\n She dies. Nearly invalidating his entire MISSION since his attempts to achieve victory were his own undoing, WHICH would have been rather heroic and touching had those rules been set far in advance, and everyone understood the sacrifice Simon was going to have to make, but this is not the case. We are never even mentioned the possibility of Nia being a sacrifice to the cause, and only at the end are we supposed to assume this was the case all along, and that Simon knew as well.\n*SPOILERS END HERE*\nTo conclude this review that is nearly as grandiose as the show itself, I'll sum up with the fact that the first half of Gurren Lagann truly is an amazing experience, one that is gradually overshadowed or outright redone straight into its second half, making it more of a grind to watch the same events play themselves out with no real suspense on the line. And for a show that focusses solely on optimism and the human ability, it delivers an ending that shuns all of that, as if trying to spike the show with a dose of reality that is far far too late. So if the first half is an 8/10, the second is a messy 2/10, giving it a marginal 5/10 at best, based only on entertainment value, and the power of DRIIILLLS!"},

It’s pretty hard to explain this without spoiling some parts but I will try my best not to give any spoilers.\nStory: 9/10\nOne word: epic. The story is great the issues are not trivial as other series where you could easily define who is right and wrong; it’s more like a battles between ideologies since everyone thinks there are doing what is best for all. \nThe story has a humble start: a lonely and poor boy finds\n          \n        a power and decides to use it to archive freedom with the help of his “brother” who inspires him to continue. However, later on the pace starts to speed up until epic proportions (maybe too epic).\nHe lost the point to 10/10 because the world itself is too unreal. There is not even science fiction on it; they just did what they wanted.\nArt: 9/10\nYeah mechas are ugly but that was the point of the artist (or that’s what I want to think). The world itself is like a “joke world” to add extra comedy to the series and the art just fits well for this purpose.\nSound: 9/10\nWell music is good but they lack of the heartbreaking song that every show must have to archive de 10/10 in this category. Other than that you will find it enjoyable not a lot to say here.\nCharacters: 8/10\nDevelopment of the characters is good and there is enough diversity of characters that are mostly well done. Then, why 8? Well it Is simple, the way they behave as “society” is not acceptable for me there are times when you will be like “WTF? Why they’re doing that?” also I can’t give such a higher score to a series where absolutely every main character is an idiot (exept for one or two) at least give them other special ability other than “determination”.  \nEnjoyment: 10/10\nEnjoy it as a masterpiece series nothing to say here.\nOverall: 9/10\nUsually a show lower its score for big problems like boringness or stupidity but this shows lower its score for accumulations of very little things. Overall, it’s a masterpiece with minor mistakes totally epic.\n*-minor spoilers here don’t keep reading if you don’t want to be lightly spoiled-*\nOk to finish up I will add little things for the ones who doesn’t care to be lightly spoiled and want to know more about the score. pretty short.\nThe series is divided on episode 1-15 and episode 17-27 (16 is recap). 1-15 you’ll say: good show! And 17-27 you’ll say: epic!!!!! What is wrong is that 17-27 you realize 1-15 is crap. Also you realize there was an easier route of success but the characters dumbness screw it. Other minor things: the galaxies behave like solid disks, people care more about what they have than their lifes, material just pup up from nothing and others."},

Instead,I got a emotionally moving action packed comedy with amazing characters, unique and cool art, with what I conisder to be one of the best anime sound tracks ever. This anime put me on the edge of my seat, made me laugh, and made me want to go fight the most powerful force in the universe for the dake of freedom. This anime is, to be blunt, absolutely amazing.\nNow, the plot is fairly complex as the idea of it takes\n          \n        a long to to explain, but what makes it special is its such a unique idea. I have never before seen an anime with the major world basis like guren Lagann, one where men are fighting to win their freedom back from an emperor, who is beating them down to protect them. The plot allowed for epic looking fight scenes between huge Mecha, that got so big in the end they could use galaxies like throwing stars. Thats another amazing feature of the show. For all its seriousness, theres an equal amount of ridiculousness in it too. From the beast men, to Kamina  and his personality, to some of random events that make no sense yet still occur. All of this blended toghether to make a gripping story.\nNow, in terms of Sound and Art, I fell in love with this anime. Their soundtrack was amzing, from their openings, to their battle music, to the most inspiring song Ive ever heard in my life, \"Row Row, Fight The Power\". The music in the anime entranced me. Then theres the art. The art was like any other anime, until it got to the commerical picture, or there was an epic fight going on. Then it took on a very rough looking sketchy style, and even though it shouldn't have, it made it look amazing. \n\nNow, for the highlight if this anime, its characters. You have simon, who starts as a timid kid who gains belief in himself through his encouragement and support from Kamina, who believes in him like no one else. Then there is Kamina. A ridiculous over the top character, who also happens to be the most inspiring anime character Ive ever seen. Being able go be ridiculous and funny, and the  at a moments notice be the support for everyone around him,  he makes everyone want to be their best. Theres Yoko, the skilled sniper who follows her own path, and is the equalizer to Kamina. Supportive and kind, she helps make Simon the amazing man he is in the end. And those are just the 3 main chracters. The list could go on for ages. Essentially, what makes this anime special is its characters, who while are ridiculous and strange, yet so awe inspiring and human at the same time.\nOveral, this anime was one of the most enjoyable animes Ive ever seen, and i feel deserves the #1 spot on MAL. Its is simply, a masterpiece. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Ok so here is a golden anime, it has characters, themes, and is very entertaining. it's story is amazing filled with a lot of character development, the art is outstanding with high quality action scenes as well as many screens with pure chaos, meaning that the visuals were very well thought out and planned. The soundtrack of this is so amazing and has many jazz, upbeat, and emotional music. The characters were very well developed and had distinct characterization. Other characters i consider are 2-d characters (characters in which you can't create like ten or more adjectives to describe them), but TTGL characters were almost\n          \n        always 3-D. This anime was really enjoying to me as I saw the characters grow and develop as well as the TRUE MEANING of the anime. Excuse me for being over analytical... but that's what people do... \n*SPOILERS \nThe anime displayed many themes that are both modern and go straight to the insides\nThe anime talks about identity in which simon the digger is finding who he really is (this theme is also evident in almost all the characters) the characters all grow and develop and make their own path. if you can recall the scene were Simon made his speech he said 'he wasn't kamina but instead he was simon the digger'. Throughout the anime Simon portrays many character traits, which show signs of him being a true man. and at the end of the anime he doesn't finish the phrase 'who do the hell do you think I am?', because he finally found his true identity. the phrase who do the hell do you think I am is used also to portray the theme of identity. We can relate this theme to modern day life in which we all try to find who we are and what we are going to do with our lives.\nThe anime also shows the theme of self improvement improvement\nOver time the characters revolved, growing not only in strength but also character. for instance when Simon was in a depression after Kamina's death he finally was able to accept that and was able to believe in himself. 'Aniki is dead. He&rsquo;s no longer here. However, on my back, and within my heart, he lives on in me! I will put a hole in heaven itself. Even if that hole becomes my grave, as long as i break through, that is my victory! Who the hell do you think I am?' the drill also plays a significant role in portraying this theme. a drill is constantly spinning and as Simon says 'We&rsquo;re evolving more with every passing minute! With one revolution, we move forward a bit! That&rsquo;s a drill!'. characters such as Lord  Genome and Rossiu also face a revelation and end up doing the right thing. The anime describes this theme as breaking the heavens, in which the heavens are the limit of your goals. 'with this drill you will break through the heavens' (with your own power you will accomplish your goals) This theme also applies in modern life in which we are all striving to become better and like a drill with each little step we take ... we get closer to our goals. \nthe final significant theme i found was 'ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER'\nthis anime uses this theme a lot in the story. CLARIFY Power= corruption\nIt was first evident when Kamina tried to escape the village. Kamina broke through the leaders and decided to fight against their corrupted idea of the surface and break the top of the cave. This is also shown with the death rule in Rossiu's cave, in which Rossiu and the gang rebelled against this corrupted idea. The corruption of Lord Genome's power was also challenged by the gurren brigade, because the group believed that it was unjust. Like the USA, the citizens reserve the right to overthrow the government if it is unsuitable. This is also shown when Simon was put in jail from the corrupted Rossiu, and fighting against the anti spirals. This totally applies to real life, because revolutionary people  should give out their ideas to make the world a better place. Like dictatorships people who dislike their government should have the right and duty to make things right. \nI loved this anime if you think my analysis was off or anything i really don't care cuzz this was my opinion and how i perceived the anime ... if you think ttgl's main motif is to make people buy drills then go for it... this is my opinion... my review and i just want to say what a great anime this was for me\n"},

Believe in the you who believes in yourself.”\nThere’s always going to be that one (or handful of) anime that everybody just seem to worship, and that all your friends tell you that you NEED to watch, because it’s going to blow your mind.\nAnd it does blow... but not really in the way you'd expect...\nFor me, that anime is TTGL. The way this was described to me by a couple of friends made it sound like the best thing ever; it had mecha, great humor, awesome\n          \n        story & action, beautiful women and everything else you could ever wish for in a series. But in the end, I still can’t see what’s so good about this show, or why people idolize it.\nStory: (3 / 10)\nThe story, is pretty dull, to be honest. It’s nothing you haven’t seen before, nor is it innovative in any respect. A couple of friends find a giant robot and go on to defeat the evil leader. Sure, there are some twists here and there to keep you going “wat”, but in the end it’s your standard “hero single-handedly defeats the enemy against all odds”.\nBut then, halfway through, when you think “Oh, this is it, it’s finally over” they pull a time-skip out of nowhere, and you now have a somewhat different story... To be honest, I thought the second part was slightly better (atleast in terms of story), since it’s more about the intrigue and drama between characters, and the political games and whatnot, as opposed to the over-the-top battles against evil.\nThat is, until the end, where they pull some more twists out of their sleeves, and yet again you’re left saying “wat”.\nArt: (7 / 10)\nAdmittedly, even if I didn’t really like the rest of the series, I can’t say that it was ugly. In fact, the art was probably the best part of it, for me. Most scenes are pretty good quality, with smooth animations, and well detailed characters. However, there are some scenes that change the artstyle into something more... hard to describe... It makes it look a bit more “gritty”, so to speak, though yet again, I wouldn’t call it ugly.\nSound: (5 / 10)\nAs I’ve said before, I’m not one to usually take note of background music, and the few times it was prominent enough I was probably too baffled or annoyed to actually care enough.\nAs for the voice actor’s, I personally watched the dub for this show (so this factors into the score a bit), and it was one of the most annoying experiences I’ve ever had.\nI just can’t stand Simon’s voice, and his constant shouting “Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro!”. I can’t really remember any other VA that really stood out either, but I would highly recommend anyone who wants to watch this to do so with subs.\nCharacter: (4 / 10)\nThe characters were pretty mediocre, in my opinion. I didn’t feel like there was much character development at all (looking at you here, Simon), nor did I ever really care for any character all that much. To be honest, I found most of the characters either stupid or just simply annoying, and since this (atleast the latter) didn’t really change as the show went on, it really ruined the show (further) for me.\nEnjoyment: (2 / 10)\nThis show is a constant mess of over-the-top action scenes, manly screams, fanservice, and bad comedy. Evidently, a lot of people are going to find this show absolutely amazing and hilarious, but in my case.. well, I guess I just couldn’t handle all the epicness.\nStill, if you like all of this stuff, or enjoyed any previous similar works by Gainax (FLCL) you’ll most likely love this as well, but if you’re looking for something atleast a bit serious, then this is not for you... at all.\n"},

I am not a big fan of emotional anime and shit or write reviews, but I like this anime enough to write one. Anyways this anime is different than all the others, Tengen Toppa doesn't get as emo as Naruto or as serious as the Gundam Series. I mean if you like anime with a sad and emotional storyline thats up to you. Uhh, FUTHHERMORE.\nTTGL has the best storyline with the whole 'Up yours' to the enemy type of thing. Not only that but they have the weirest charcters. I mean a pink hair girl sniping with a overly large\n          \n        sniper gun, wearing NOTHING but bras and panties and a overly confidence idiot, Kamina, who has the best catchphrase in the whole anime. AND they have the weirest mecha type machines. Which mades it so freaken funny at the beginning. Its childish, but its better than gundams.\nThe story have so many surpises and when it get intense with the whole battle and stuff, they always have the best moral boost talk before killing the enemy. Watch it and find out.\nBut whats really important is that they have a DECENT ENDING. YES, Like how a anime suppose to end. &gt;_&gt;"},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="                          \n    Ok let me make this clear from the start. I HATE Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. I hate its amount of nonsense, its animation and most of all I hate how unbelievably immature it is (and not in a fun way).\nBefore I start digging the hole,let me name the two things I did like about it. One: The soundtracks \"Nicopol\" and \"Roh roh\" (rap version) were awesome. Two: At the start of the second half of the series, there was some pretty nice political debate between the characters. This barely lasted for 2-3 episodes though, apparently it wasn't \"over-the-top\" enough for the series.\nNow to grab the\n          \n        shovel; for some reason I dislike drills right now. The anime is WAAAAY too over-the-top, to a level where it becomes downright retarded. And I'm not just talking about people shouting with all of their lungs. I'm talking about robots combining (god I hate mechas), galaxies being LITERALLY grabbed and thrown like baseballs, and other equally stupid 2-year-old fantasies. On the bright side, if there is a physics teacher or a scientist you dislike you can simple show them this anime and they will commit suicide.\nAnd then there is the anime's theme. No I don't mean the f@cking mechas, but basically the main ideology that the whole anime revolves around. \"If you have the will, you can do anything.\"... Well that is true, so long as you have the power to do that... For example, say you're headmaster in a school, ,can you expel every student? Yes, because you have the POWER to do so, those annoying little brats! Now say you're a homeless guy who wastes his money on drinking. Can you still expell those students? No because you're a miserable failure with no power over them. For another example lets say you want to change the way a country works. Can you do it as an average day-to-day employee? No because you have no political power whatsoever. But if you were a politician? You can make a worthwhile effort because you have the POWER to do so. If you don't like the amount of power you currently have just work your way to increasing it. The show just straight up ignores this, allowing for stupidities like a squirell becoming human through sheer force of will and fighting an alien head-on, or robots with no compability whatsoever combining. Oh and keep in mind that noone EVER works on becoming more powerful. The closest we get to training is when our stupid protagonist called Simon and the even stupider former protagonist Kamina try to make their robot union technique look cooler in a pathetic attempt by the animators to offer us humor. They NEVER EVER try to imrpover by pretty logical things such as gadget upgrades or perhaps learning their opponents' weaknesses. Force of will people. When someone aims a gun at your head just shout \"who the hell do you think I am?\" and cross your arms. The rest will work itself out. Either that or you will die and the average IQ level of the planet will go up.\nTo make the hole larger... Lets talk about that \"oh my god\" awful animation. I'll not say that I can animate better, but I can easily say that I would animate more... Maturely. The animation reminds waaaaaay too much of a manga for its own good, seeming fake by most anime standards. Hell, Yamishibai's animation is more realistic compared to this. In case the anime itself wasn't immature enough on its own, the animators decided to add the names of attacks or transformations with BIG BRIGHT RED LETTERS that cover half the screen. To me it just made already-rediculous things appear even stupider.\nUnsurprisingly I found myself siding with the anti-spirals most of the time, hoping that they would get those apes to shut up. And to those who say \"you don't get it\"...Yes, I don't get it, at all! This isn't entertaining or smart, it's a tribute to 2 year-old fantasies, where the big robot goes \" vroom vroom!\" and then \"pewh pewh!\", and the worst part is, it doesn't recognize itself as such, but instead takes itself seriously. How does this even have fans?!\n        "},

However, what Gainax does do is execute these ideas flawlessly and that is what counts. \nI also find it to be a more accessible super robot show for just a casual viewer, and hope that this would then lead them onto other shows such as GaoGaiGar or Getter Robo. \nFrom start to finish Gurren Lagann is entertaining and 'fun' to watch, I\n          \n        felt that sitting through the episodes was never a chore like some series manage to make it for certain scenes or even an entire episode.

Could you tell me more about it?\"\nHAR! How long are you going to run? The planet needs you! No, the galaxy needs you!! Screw that, the whole universe needs you!!! A fierce war lasting several years is being fought, resulting in severe casualties. The humans are heavily oppressed on all fronts by endless waves of beastmen, the ominous Lordgenome, and the shadowy Anti-Spirals. They’re in constant danger no matter where they are, be that an underground village, a hot springs in\n          \n        the middle of nowhere, or a city.\nHave you seen the adverts? Heard the rumours? Think this story doesn't make any sense? Well let me just say: Real men/women don't think! They act! This is one lengthy thrill ride, with no time for breaks, so make sure to keep your seatbelt buckled or you'll lose your head! Persevere with your eyes and ears, climb the ranks as a member of TTGL, and you even get to pilot your own Gunmen: a mecha weapon that's crucial in fighting against the bad guys. \n\"Ha-ha, do you really expect me to believe that? What are the action scenes like? What could I possibly witness?\"\nEh? Thought I'd already mentioned some of it. Well, things can get a bit chaotic at times, what with all the heart-stopping action and thrilling explosions going back and forth. But don’t worry, as you should have a clear image of what’s happening most of the time and some of the stuff is pretty spectacular to see! Just avoid becoming too dazzled by the numerous mecha battles and Gunmen designs!\nWhen there's a lull in the fighting, perhaps you could admire the variety of landscapes, which look rather decent but will probably take a backseat to the grand events occurring simultaneously. \n\"Sounds awesome, but I still have some questions about characters and their develop-\"\nHold it. This news just came in. We may not have need for you after all! Ever heard of Team Dai-Gurren before? You have now. Probably one of the greatest bunch of people you can find, who'll throw themselves into any kind of trouble in the coolest manner possible. Simon and Kamina are charismatic badasses who undergo so much growth over the course of the war and learn several lessons in life, of which they're happy to share with their comrades; they're the undisputed leaders of this whole show. \nThink the female members aren't so high and mighty? Bzzt wrong! Yoko Littner is one tough customer who'll kick the crap out of her foes (but don't let her kiss you), whilst Nia Teppelin will do the same but in a slightly nicer way. Assuming you get into Gurren Lagann, there are plenty of other colourful characters to meet, including Kittan, Leeron, and the ever-tiny Boota, every single one of them legends in their own right; you may, however, develop a strong urge to punch that annoying kid, Rossiu Adai. \nHave I discouraged you? Think there's no chance to compete with these guys? Well think again! Go beyond the impossible and kick reason to the curb! That's the Gurren-dan way!\n\"Huh? But-\"\nOf course, to get into TTGL you’ll need to showcase some of your qualities. Heard of the song “Libera me from Hell”? It’s a fantastic piece of music, and one of many, that help to raise morale and increase excitement levels. So put some passion into belting out DO THE IMPOSSIBLE SEE THE INVISIBLE ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER! \nAhem. Pardon me.\nOr perhaps you’d like to try the awesome and energetic “Sorairo Days” instead? You may even want to perform “Minna No Peace”, a song that’s full of spirit and promotes love and peace. It may be difficult, but I believe your determination is one that shall pierce through the heavens!\n\"I have to sing those theme songs in public?! And don't you mean \"drill\" rather than \"determination\"? What-\"\nExperiencing the trials and tribulations of Team Dai-Gurren will no doubt give you a massive rush on more than one occasion! You’ll need to be mentally AND physically prepared. Not only will your body be tested to the limit when attempting to harness spiral power, but you must make sure that the sheer GAR factor belonging to Simon, Kamina, and their friends don't overwhelm you during a battle! If you do, then let’s see ya grit those teeth! \n\"Hang on, I'm confused. Let me-\"\nI hope you'll join our side, which already has in excess of one hundred thousand members! By war’s end I expect there to be blood spilled, manly tears shed, and a severe lack of sleep. But it’s fully worth the sacrifice. You want to know what Tengen Toppa is? What Gurren Lagann is? Embark on this epic journey and find out for your- \n\"Stop! We're talking about an ANIME SERIES here right?\"\nSay what? \n\"Up until now, I've been trying to make sense of what you're talking about. Now then, let me attempt to summarize this series. \nSo the PROS are:\n      ---Fast-paced action with plenty of over-the top clashes between mecha, humans and beastmen\n      ---Engaging storyline with some unexpected twists and turns\n      ---Most loose ends are tied up by the end of the conclusion\n      ---Fluid, stylish animation and varied character models\n      ---Fantastic soundtrack that vastly improves the action as well as evoking emotion among viewers\n      ---Very competent voice acting that's great at bringing life to the characters\n      ---Characters that have depth and development as well as moments where they steal the spotlight\n      ---An abundance of comedy and drama that's well crafted into the show \nAnd the CONS are:\n      ---Elements of the plot can be quite far-fetched\n      ---Expect to see no shortage of Deus Ex Machina\n      ---Series ending may not be to everyone's liking\n      ---Some of the battles on show may cause epilepsy\n      ---Only 27 episodes long\nSo despite starting out as a parody of the mecha genre, TTGL is so epic that it ends up becoming one of THE most memorable mecha anime? Wow!\"\nAre you an Anti-Spiral in disguise?! You think that sums up the greatness that is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann? You know nothing, recruit! Even if there's a fourth wall, we break it down!\nWHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK WE ARE?!"},

This nonstop adrenaline rush is driven by strong characters and mind-blowing imagery. The monster of the week formula the show employs is overshadowed by the insane amount plot movement, character development and creativity. Amazing protagonists are thrown against equally amazing villains in a kinetic clash where self-confidence is all the power the characters ever need. Ignore all the crap that whizzes past your head, the show hits you with such a heavy sledgehammer of epic that all the corny clichés and downright stupid elements seem perfectly acceptable.\nDespite all the\n          \n        show’s accomplishments, it’s not without its flaws. The first fifteen episodes is an amazing display of creative storytelling that has become my personal standard that I expect all future anime to follow. In fact, the first part is so good that much of the final twelve episodes look like a fanfic in comparison. No, the show never stops being cool. In a sense, the show continually grows even more ambitious with each passing episode, but actually accepting the story of the second part requires near brain death (not that this is hard considering how jaw-dropping epic the final episodes turn out to be).\nGurren Lagann requires a heavy dose of tolerance for the absurd. This cup of tea is supersaturated five times over with pure caffeine, so fasten your seatbelts and push your suspension of disbelief as high as it can go. If you are the type of person willing to scream “hell yeah” as the protagonist gives a bombastic speech about self-confidence in a massive, sunglass totting robot, then be sure to check out this anime.\n        "},

At one point I asked the guy that helps me with recommendations about it, and he told me \"it's fun but nothing super, classic over the top Τrigger\", and later added \"it's good for mindless entertainment\". After watching it, I conclude that he was basically right. \nHere's the main problem. This anime is considerably nonsensical and somewhat incoherent. If you are the thinking type of person, you'll encounter difficulties with this anime. I'm not saying this to insult the people that enjoyed it, there's no shame in watching\n          \n        something just for \"mindless entertainment\", as mentioned above. However, for people like me, it's not like that. This anime gives a big emphasis on being cool and flashy, often throwing logic out of the window to do so. If you are the type of watcher that will want explanations for the stuff that happen, you are not going to find them.\nBut hey, don't let that discourage you too much. I still consider this anime to be \"fine\", which is why I gave it a rating of 6. It looks very good, it sounds great, it has an interesting story. There's also the matter of the characters, but unfortunately, the big cast wasn't taken advantage as well as it could have.\nHonestly, I think most people will like this anime. So, don't let the \"6\" bother you too much.  I'd recommend it to most people. Basically, only avoid if you think too much, but even then, it's not like you'll find it to be trash or anything.\nTrivia: The \"When I'm X\" meme originated from here! When I learned that, it was the final push that made me decide to watch this anime instead of any of the other 20 - 30 waiting in my plan to watch list.\n        "},

It may sound corny as it is cliche for protagonists to miraculously turn a lost cause into a victory by never giving up but this particular in its anime, has a loud aura that emanates all the way to the core of the soul.\nThe words and the meaning they hold may be the same but the one thing that made this anime stand out was the\n          \n        sincerity of those words.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    “If you're gonna dig, dig to the heavens”- 10 out of 10\nTengan Toppa Gurren Lagann had the unfortunate timing to be released in 2007, during one of anime’s greatest periods of brilliance. Death Note and Code Geass both were released on TV around the same time, and they (ranked number 1 and 5 in MyAnimeList popularity as of 9/29/09) kept this show generally receiving less attention than it should have had. However, this is one anime that I feel outstrips them both and reaches a plateau amongst the anime heavens.\nWhy is the series so good?  Firstly because the show’s message, a simple and good\n          \n        one by the way, is overtly pounded constantly into your head unlike most other anime. Subtlety is thrown out the window; the characters don’t have time for stuff like that! Basically the message is to be all that you can be. Kamina tells us this, Simon eventually tells us this, and all the characters by the end of the show genuinely believe that the impossible can be reached. That’s what makes people stand up and say Gurren Lagann is epic; the show’s message is universal. Who in their life hasn’t been told that they were not good enough, that they were not liked, or that they didn’t have what it took. The difference in Gurren Lagann is that the characters consistently prove their naysayers wrong and fulfill their impossible dreams. Their fulfillment of their goals makes us feel like we can attain our lofty goals as well. From deep underground to the Earth’s surface to outer space to different dimensions, the characters of Gurren Lagann break through any barrier in their way, and look like Gods among men in the process.\nThe show’s overt message of positive self-belief is epitomized most in one \nparticular scene following a setback for the group. Simon, who in my opinion is the most inspirational character of the whole cast, delivers a monologue for the ages with everything on the line against a powerful enemy. Then he crushes his opponent. The scene is the turning point of the whole show, and I was in awe the moment this particular episode ended. Gainax constructed a perfect scene here, and Simon delivers what I consider my fondest memory of the whole series. Simon’s transition away from feeling worthless to becoming a man is at the heart of why this series is such a success, and although done repeatedly before, Gurren Lagann’s approach to the theme works the best.  The characters, especially Simon and Kamina, consistently defy expectations and vocalize feelings that none of us would have the courage to say in real life to our critics.\nThe second reason why the show is one of the greatest anime ever made is \nbecause the show has amazing plot balance. You truly cannot predict what is going to happen in the show, and that is exhilarating. It is not all brainless mech fighting that would have devalued the quality of the show. You have moments of character development and side stories along with perfectly timed periods of reflection on what has happened previously in the story in case you missed it the first time. During the actual battles, you have clever enemies saying witty words of banter to Team DaiGurren, and you of course have the truly epic speeches that are intermixed with the furious gunmen battles. Gurren Lagann achieves a strong ratio of character dialogue and fighting, and it helps the series avoid monotony to a great amount.\nThe third reason why this show epitomizes anime is because it is simply the easiest anime to watch without thinking. You are able to turn your brain off and simply stare in awe of what you are experiencing on the screen. Moments when the show delivers something complicated that leads you to think you have to start trying to piece things together, the show makes fun of itself with self-directed humor. Yet the show is by no means a simple story. The plot is complex and yet is not needed to enjoy the series. This is not like a chess game anime where deft understanding of one episode is required to understand the next. \nFinally, I would say that this show has some of the most powerful “one-liners”, quotes, and key phrases that keep the show long in a viewer’s mind after he or she has experienced Gurren Lagann. The previously aforementioned speech is one of these, and these nuggets are everywhere in Gurren Lagann, pumping the viewer up and motivating them to keep watching. This is one anime where I would highly recommend the English dub if you can, since I felt this was a strong portion of why I was so moved by the show. I could see US or European viewers not feeling the same way about the show as others simply because they decided to watch the show with subtitles. The English Dub is really that good. Yes, you’ll be thinking hey isn’t Kamina the same guy who did Gohan from DBZ and isn’t Simon the same guy who did Sasuke from Naruto, but I feel the dub added to the emotion of each scene. Not to say watching the show in Japanese is a bad idea; I’m just going from personal experience.\nWhatever you do in life, Gurren Lagann will inspire you to do that task or job with more vigor and ferocity than you ever thought possible. No other anime has the moving power that this show brings to the table, and its enjoyment factor is through the roof. This is one anime that must be experienced to understand the emotions that reviewers pour out when they speak of the show. So what are you doing reading this review? Go out and watch Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann already! Dig a little bit and see for yourself if you find the heavens upon viewing this amazing anime.  I wouldn’t be surprised if you did."},

The only word that I can think of to describe the story of Gurren Lagann is epic.Everything in this anime is epic. \nThe setting takes place in a apocalyptic future from a small hole in the ground, to the wasteland on the surface, to capital cities, to space, to entire galaxies, to dimensional rift in the galaxy that would serve as the battle ground for the final battle because the universe itself is not big enough to hold the final battle. \nThe story has a lot of things incorporated into it. So much action and epic fights and\n          \n        moments with a lot of thought provoking concepts to match. I see so much understanding of theoretical philosophy and science in the story that I love it. The story gets pretty ridiculous as the story progresses (and it makes me laugh sometimes) but generally it makes it better. That is due in my opinion so many philosophical and scientific concepts are being added into this story I can't help but get excited and say\" holy sh&t this is f^%king epic! what are they going to add next to this show?\" because you feel like nothing is too big to add to this show. A lot of people say that this show gets so ridiculous it makes no sense. The show makes sense to me in almost way (my personal rule never say 100% sure unless Im trying to be epic). I think I can understand and explain almost anything that happens in the show and would take on that challenge if I have to.\nThe main characters are extremely likable and epic. Kamina is so manly and dumb that he is one of my favorite characters in an epic and awesome way. The rest of the characters would later all share his attitude including Simon who becomes like a clone of him.\n(Yoko is one of my favorite anime girls so a short description of her)\nThere is also Yoko. Only fan service to some but to me she is the perfect woman. In the exterior, she is a war hardened soldier. She knows what must be done and what is most important which makes her a fine soldier mentally and she is a capable sniper physically making her the only human that can take down a gunman without another gunman (besides from Lord Genome who can take one out with his fist).  On the inside I see a sweet, fragile, and shy little girl that is willing to make sacrifices and leans more to the intellectual side than her surface suggests. She won't show it much as a good soldier won't show their true self but in moments where she let her guard down it is pretty evident. She is loyal as hell, not getting married and even devoting her life to be a teacher to for fill Kamina's wish to protect children. Cute face, long red hair, and a killer body she is an ideal woman. Don't say she is a slut because of her outfit. In their setting clothe could be hard to get. Look at how much clothing simon and kamina wears and she wears what fits the situation. She actually prefers less skin evident in her swimsuit and teacher outfit. Also her loyalty to Kamina proves her to be the opposite to the meaning of slut.

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    A completely preposterous, big-hearted mecha series that does more than just crank up anime action and emotion to eleven--it takes it all beyond the impossible, going so ridiculously far over the top that even as you're scoffing at everything that's unfolding before you your heart is swelling--remembering the first time a mecha series blew you away; remembering what it was like when your imagination was capable of turning a handful of Legos into an epic space battle; remembering what it was like to feel everything powerfully, unfiltered by logic and adulthood. Bless you, Gainax.\nGurren Lagann begins in an underground, post-apocalyptic town, where the brash and\n          \n        passionate Kamina is looking for a way to break through to the surface, and to see the sky. He recruits the young and impressionable Simon in his quest, though it isn't long before they learn that the surface is mostly a wasteland, ravaged by an army of 'beastmen,' who pilot giant mechas. Kamina begins recruiting a rag-tag band of humans to fight back, and once they learn that they can hijack the enemy mechas, their revolution against the beastmen begins in earnest. And then everything blows up from there, so that by the end of the series the kinetic mecha battles are occurring on a scale that puts everything else to shame. Remember the final stage of Katamari Damacy, when even the continents cannot resist the pull of your mighty Katamari? The final battle here dwarfs even that immense scale.\nSome people are going to have difficulty making it that far though--the first 6 episodes or so have some real issues with pacing and quality control. I found that watching one episode at a time was pretty much enough for me--anything more than that and the charm wore off quickly, which the loud and unpleasant characters don't help with. The three leads are the worst offenders: Kamina is every macho-man anime stereotype squeezed into one body, Simone is a Shinji-clone, and Yoko is the ideal of 'fan-service' turned into a character. Fortunately, once the show finds its footing things improve immeasurably, and the characters harbor surprising depths that go far beyond their surface personality, which will morph most of them into truly likable (and maybe even lovable) companions by the final story arc. Of special note are the character designs throughout. Some of them are truly unique, and all are home to a few nice flourishes that help them stand out from the crowd. (Yoko's wide hips, Nia's flower-pupils, Kamina's glasses, etc. My personal favorite is Adiane, who may be my new favorite anime villainess, based solely on looks and animation alone.) The mecha designs, while frequently bizarre or just plain ugly, are also really something else, and as the characters learn that mechas can be combined in various ways the words 'transformation sequence' take on a whole new meaning.\nDespite its heavily recycled plot elements and logic-defying goofiness, the show itself hides some potent surprises: especially brave are its willingness to permanently kill off important characters and a major fast-forward (7 years) that occurs halfway through the series. Seeing all of the characters 7 years older (and their relationships and personalities advanced by seven years, as well) is hugely gratifying, as time-skips like this are something that almost never happens in anime, or in television period. Another, longer time-skip (about 20 years!) happens towards the end of the series and acts as an especially bitter-sweet epilogue--between this and the awe-inspiring (and sort of devastating) climax, particularly sensitive viewers may shed some tears. \nViewers looking for logic or layers of symbolism and meaning to work through aren't going to find much here to latch onto: Gurren Lagann is all about big mecha fights and manly mushiness, and doesn't concern itself too terribly with anything else. The mechas are powered by human emotion, everything is made of explodium, plot contrivances are necessary and frequent, and all known physical laws are thoroughly and repeatedly abused. What makes it such a joy to watch has to do with how expertly Gainax continues to one-up itself as it steamrolls ahead, all while penning what must surely be the greatest love-letter to the mecha genre (and maybe action anime period) ever. That it's got a good heart (you'll actually look forward to the speeches and moralizing in this, trust me) is just the icing on the cake, and for all of its boisterous posturing, it concludes on a surprisingly grounded note that's as triumphant as it is sad. \nGurren Lagann has some problems and won't be for everyone (for me, the biggest problem is the fan-service, which starts out innocent and funny enough, but quickly grows tiresome and occasionally dips into creepy territory), but like FLCL does for some, it perfectly captures a very specific adolescent sort of feeling, and the right audience will find it to be a lively and rousing experience that pretty much kicks all kinds of ass, ever. Recommended--even if it takes you a week to get through the first five episodes.\n        "},

My greatest appreciation goes out to Kamina, who had the largest influence on everyone in the series, and he honestly just makes you feel motivated, even in real life :o \nThe 10's are there for a reason, well deserved, and need to find a way to rearrange themselves into a number beyond comprehension.

She was a shit character from the start, instead why not develop Kamina whose development apart from the actual scenes consists of \"Yeah i was never really sure, all my ideas came to life because of Simon\".\nAlso i really liked those few episodes where Simon acts almost like some typical powerless beta after he witnesses the scene between Yoko and Kamina and then picks up and becomes all mature and great and acts like an OP shounen-protag, but because you see him gain this confidence and strength it's not a bad thing, in fact it's one of the best things about the show. The OST is great and all the art is drawn absolutely beautiful, everything looks Sharp. I'm glad Gainax never lost their touch after FLCL and continued using that amazing sharpness that gives a feeling like it was being made in 4k.

It made just\n          \n        about everything way over the edges. Almost every episode made me laugh so hard, but at the same time they made me think so hard. But Gurren Lagann wasn’t all that crazy humour.\nThere were serious times which brings up questions… what is the purpose of all of this? What is the purpose of life itself? Why there isn’t that kind of people in the real world? Why there isn’t that kind of power of mind, the power to never give up, power of doing just what the hell you always wanted to do. Power… that after losing your loved ones, you can continue your life stronger. That you have the power inside you, you just need to use it for yourself and for good. Well… this anime really gives a lesson about the world and human spirit without screaming it straight to the face (or, well, it screams but… I can’t explain it). Humans truly are interesting creatures.\nFrom now on, there are SPOILERS, so this is SPOILER ALERT! Don’t read any longer if you don’t want to know some major plot twits or how this series is going to end! Because some of you may not read this to the end because of spoilers, I’m going to say here – WATCH THIS ANIME, OR EVEN TRY IT OUT. You really need to.\nThere was times when I cried so much that I hated this. I loved the characters from the very beginning, and the art was really nice. First it was more old fashion and cartoon like, but grown up with the story and characters. Mechas were so awesome and different, it was funny that when people inside were talking then mecha robots mouths were moving too. Those robots reflected their pilots – Simon in Lagann was the BRAINS of Gurren Lagann while Kamina in Gurren was strength. In anime, it felt everything went so crazy fast that you needed to watch very closely to know what was happening and where. There were only few times when you saw characters and their surroundings clearly. Or, this was the case on couple of first episodes, but when the series goes on, you can actually see clearly. I began to miss that “crazy fastness”, if I’m honest..\nGurren Lagann didn’t try to be smart, although there was a lots of contains that would’ve need specific explanations – but because Gurren Lagann didn’t took itself too seriously, that realistic wasn’t needed at all. For example… what kind of flying ship (it should not even be able to fly) CAN kick another flying battleship? Humour was a big part of Gurren Lagann, at least in the first part of episodes. I was sad when that crazy humour kind of disappeared... story became more serious, although people still build a city in seven years, made bio-computer, pulled the real moon out of nowhere and found out that they can even leap through time and space (thanks to that crazy spiral power energy which has no limits at all). Well, I said that it didn’t try to be smart.. and I was glad about it - it was the part that made this series so freaking EPIC. Every battle scene were so epic I couldn’t stand it, the beating in my chest went so crazy that I was laughing like a maniac because Team Gurren was just too overwhelmingly powerful (I think my family were about to send me to mental hospital).\nEnemies became friends and allies in Gurren Lagann. Characters evolved rapidly, although after every hardship they went through. That was one main thing in this anime – all these sad and horrifying things just makes humans stronger, and they really used that power to move on and making world better place to live. I loved all the characters, they all have their meanings, strong points and weaknesses. All the good characters weren’t good all the time, but in the end they found their way back to light. I just had the feeling that Rossiu was one doing awful things in the second part of the series because Simon needed to stay as he was – if he would have been the one deciding to sacrifice all those people when “moon” was about to crush the Earth… it would have taken all the likes and innocence from Simon – but well, Simon also killed beastmens, we just don’t think it’s bad thing because we couldn’t see any blood when mechas were destroyed (and he also killed immortal Lord Genom). Rossius and Virals evolvement were the very best character evolvement in this anime (well, so does Simons.) This series has manly badass power more than we have in this whole wide world.\nOne thing I have learned after watching anime is that the best animes have the crappiest endings, and this ending is one of the crappiest. Why does Simon always get the crappiest things happen to him - it just ain't fair. Simon is so strong, but very sad things happened to him. He lost his parents when he was a kid. He loses loads of his friends. He thinks that he caused the deaths of two of his loved ones, and it really hurts. That hit me, that hit me right in the feels. Kaminas death caused Simon to evolve to a person like him. Nias death felt just sad… it’s like Gurren Lagann tried to add more naturalness in the end but it felt only frustrating and enforced.\nSo, to be completely honest, that was one of the crappiest endings possible... but at the same time it was the best ending this series could have had. Simon saved the whole goddamn universe. The scene where true hero goes somewhere where even his friends can't reach him anymore.... It really hurts but told that Simon just needed peace in his life and mind after all what happened. He deserved it, truly. Leeron was one of my top favorites, too. Blue haired weirdo who didn’t grow old at appearance at all.\nWell, one weird thing in the end was that old Rossiu and Simon looked like the chief in Rossius birth city... ._. and sounded that too! It was just creepy. And too bad we didn't get any information about Kamina's father. But I’m sure he tried the same thing as Simon and others, when they fight Anti-Spiral to save the Earth. I think Kaminas father was the one who that anti-spiral-weird-looking- stick-figure meant by saying: “One was trying that before you.”\nThis anime really made me shed a lot of tears. After watching this, I feel like I can die in peace. All in all, I just really loved this show. I'll be back to watch it again someday, I'm sure of that. But first I have to get over this sorrow... it's really over. I need to take a break, because this really took every energy I possibly had.\nJust who the hell do you think I a- oh, guess I’m only nobody (writing shitty review which is hard to understand because lack of studying)."},

Stop the stagnant life and do what\n          \n        it was that when you were little you dreamed of. just take a second to remember what that was an how much you loved pretending to do it it made you so happy so fight for it do what makes you happy and never give up never let anyone tell you you can't and never give in. When it feels like you are about to and you are not going any where just remember to Fight the Power And you have all your loved ones to help you lend there strength.\nThis is why i like gurren lagann so remember\nRow Row\nFIGHT THE POWER!!!!!!!!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Whenever people recommend Gurren Laggan, they say things like \"Turn your brain off\" or \"You're not supposed to take it seriously\", and to that i say (pardon my french): F***ing Bull***t. People seem to misunderstand the nature and appeal of a show like this and often dismiss it as nothing more than a stupid but fun popcorn material in which nothing makes sense. So i decided to write a review to try to explain why it's not such a show, but a well constructed piece of art that not only stays true to its philosophy the whole time, but also backs up its seemingly simple\n          \n        ideas with more than stellar execution.\nFirstly, let's talk about the story of Gurren Lagann. It is a coming of age story, but more than anythinh, it is also a story about human progress and evolution. The show goes out of its way to constantly reinforce the idea that moving forward and denying the status quo is the only way to progress. This is not only shown through the huge amount of absurd motivational quotes or characters constantly pointing towards the sky, but also through the heavy use of the spiral symbol, which represents the constant need to improve and the spinning of a drill that can only move forward. And the characters follow this philosophy all the way through, even though they might have hated it at some point. Whenever a character deviates from it, they need to be \"woke up\" by another character saying the famous line \"Let's see you grit those teeth!\" followed by a punch to the face, and this technique is always successful. Even the concept itself supports these ideas: the main character pilots a robot that LITERALLY runs on fighting spirit (a.k.a \"spiral energy\"), and nobody questions or tries to explain it, because the show is fully aware of how ridiculous it is.\nAnother famous quote is \"Deny common sense to make the impossible possible.\" Many people think this is a stupid quote and it doesn't make any sense, but it serves 2 purposes. The first is to remind the audience that anything is possible in this universe and the show is fully aware of that. The second is to remind the characters to always stay true to the nature of the show. This is why, whenever faced with a harsh situation, they will never run away and they will never make the obvious decision. Instead, they will always come up with the most bold and unexpected move, usually involving charging head-fisrt into the enemy, even when the more logical decision would be to retreat. However, these decisions can sometimes lead to the death of an important character, which gives a feeling of consequence and makes the stakes feel more real.\nSpeaking of death, i also like how this aspect is portrayed. The death of a character has a real impact on the others and always serves a purpose: either to advance the story or to affect the development of certain characters. The message behind this is that victory cannot be achieved without sacrifice and that you need to honor the sacrifices of your fellow men and keep moving forward for their sake.\nRegarding the fights, they feel very epic, ridiculous and over the top and they usually end with a flashy finishing move. They perfectly fall in line with the message that Gurren Lagann is trying to send. And as to express and exagerrate the feeling of progress, the villains not only get stronger, but also bigger. This way, the entirety of the show becomes a build-up to an epc climax of unbelievable proportions, which in turn leads to a very satisfying pay-off at the end of the series.\nNow let's talk about the characters of Gurren Lagann. The main character, Simon, seems like a typical Shinji Ikari in the beginning, lacking confidence and motivation. On the other side of the spectrum there is Kamina, pobably the most inspirational dude in the history of anime and my personal favorite character from the show. He is a hot headed guy that constantly denies the status quo and doesn't take sh*t from anybody. He is a big brother figure for Simon, but more importantly he is the embodiment of everything that Gurren Lagann stands for. Then there is Yoko, whom many people dismiss as pure fanservice material, but the message that is being conveyed here is that no matter gow big her breasts are, her personality and purpose to the show will never be limited by them. She is a strong female lead that can hold her own, not to mention a true bad-ass in some moments. The supporting cast is very colorful and funny as well, no characters feel out of place, they all serve a certain purpose.\nThe dynamic between Simon and Kamina is what i find truly fascinating. Kamina constantly pushes Simon's development by urging him to take action and believe in himself, while Simon holds Kamina back from being too reckless. And while Kamina might sometimes disagree with Simon's decisions, he is never mad at him, because he understands his feelings and the importance of keepng a cool head in battle. This balance is necessary for Team Gurren to advance.\nJust as much as the characters, the animation is full of style and personality. At first i wasn't fond of the simplistic art style, but then it grew on me and i understood that it actually made the robots feel more unreal and flexible. I also like the use of color in this anme. Each character has their own defining colors and every landscape feels different, from the red tones of the wasteland to the deep blue nuances of outer space. The character and cosume designs are unique and easy to identify, and the effort put into each frame of animation is very apparent (except for episode 4, but we don't talk about episode 4).\nThe soundtack is, as everything else, awesome. the music fits well with each scene and gives an overall feeling of epicness and adventure. One track in particular, commonly known as Row Row fight the power, is a beautiful blend of opera and rap that not only feels pumping and energetic, but also soothing and calming at the same time. It reinforces the idea that you need to balance a calm mind with the willingness to act and that victory cannot be achieved without sacrifice. As you can see, everything blendsin quite well.\nAs for enjoyment, what else could i say? There is never a dull moment in this anime and even the occasional filler episode is entertaining, because by that time you already care for these characters so much that you just want to see them relax for a bit instead of fighting an ever more powerful villain. And because of the ever increasing scale of the fights, the stakes feel huge and the pay-off is even bigger.\nWhen i hear the phrase \"Turn your brain off\" i think of an anme that has no deeper meaning, an anime with lots of plotholes and in which characters make stupid decisions that make no sense in that certain context. Gurren Lagann has no such problems. EVERYTHING makes sense in Gurren Lagann BECAUSE it happens in Gurren Lagann. The reality of this show has it own set of rules and logic, the major rules being that everything is possible and only the most unconventional option is acceptable. And the show never forgets its nature and philosophy. Everything fits in perfectly and serves the purpose of expressing the same idea, and this is what i truly consider brilliant execution. It doesn't matter how deep the themes and ideas of a story are. If the way they are presented is uninteresting and the execution is poor, i will never be able to care about them.\n What i hope you'll get out of this review is that the next time you critique Gurren Lagann for its nonsensical action and lack of deeper themes, you can actually understand why the show is that way and why it makes perfect sense for it to be that way. So don't turn your brain off when watching Gurren Lagann, turn it on to the max so that you can truly appreciate this beautiful masterpiece.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This was it the show that got me back into anime! Gurren Lagann was a adrenaline rush from start to finish, and it offered so much content in just 27 episodes and numerous OVA titles. \nStory: The story of Gurren Lagann is a bit slow to start at first, but once it starts kicking it's hard to look away. In essence Team Gurren is fighting against all odds to preserve humanity; the pacing is good once you get through the first couple episodes, and the story finishes on a good note. The most interesting part of the story to me, was how it scaled in\n          \n        size along with the world when a new threat presented itself. \nArt: The art was spectacular! and mind blowing! Very rich with colors when it came to the Mechas. The style is unique and feels like it's apart of the environment of the story. The action sequences were the highlights; the amount of art detail put into the fights made them incredible to watch. \nSound: The sounds were stupendous and matched along with everything in the show to the action sequences, comedic moments, and dramatic scenes you felt every ounce of it. The soundtrack did everything it needed to do, and it added to the level of emotional feeling that occurred in very high tense moments throughout the story.\nCharacters: The Characters were awesome! I loved how the show really built up it's characters as the triumphed over hardships, overcoming every adversity that came there way. As the show progressed the characters became stronger not just individually, but as a whole and it shows at the very end how the characters are this unstoppable team. \nEnjoyment: I loved every second of the show! It's one of the reasons I got back into watching anime, and i have to thank it for that. The feeling I got after finishing was breathtaking, and I felt like a champion having watched it from start to finish, and enjoying every part of this insane ride!\nOverall: This is not one to be missed, if you haven't seen drop what you're doing and go watch. It's one heck of a journey from beginning to end, and if you're a fan of over top rule breaking, and throwing common sense out the window then this is for you!  \n"},

Since it is probably the highest ranking Gainax anime and I wanted to see why it deserved that ranking.\nAt first I thought it had an over the top story but had a deep hidden meaning behind it (like FLCL). But then I finished it and most people say that it is just as over the top and nothing more. But I think it was more meaning.\nStory:\nThe story of TTGL (Yes, I write it like this. I don't want to write the whole name every time) strats really simply, but\n          \n        slowly it keeps growing in this insane epic chaotic adventure. You can compare it to a drill in some way (small at the beginning and slowly becomes bigger). The story has themes like friendship and 'never giving up!!' and those who have watched enough shonen can understand that these aren't the most unique concepts and can feel very cliché. But TTGL gives the theme an twist to were it really became a story that motivates people. If you want to motivate someone then let them watch some of this anime. \nAlso the construction of the story is very different. Parts of the story that you usually expect to happen at the end of a series, can already happen when only a handful of episodes have been watched. That is what makes TTGL also unpredictable and makes you excited to see what will happen next.\nCharacters:\nCharacters in TTGL are very lovable and colorful. Every person is great in their own way and the characters that you first don't seem to like will develop later in big badasses or at least cool characters.\nEven in a show about being as over the top as possible (I can't emphasize that enough) the character still feel very real and you can relate with a lot of them. That is a strong point in this anime.\nArt:\nMost anime show the typical art style that modern anime is known for. Real slick lines and fluid animation, but some series want to show they're different. TTGL is like that. At epic moments that you expect insane animation you get very dynamic with lines that look like they were made with brushes.\nAll with all I like the series and if you want a show that makes you feel motivated and make you think you can do the impossible, then this is your show!!!\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Overview: My friend Allen was playing some Guild Wars 2 when another buddy and I suggested Gurren Lagann to him, and he told us: “I don't really want to watch Gurren Lagann now”. And what my other friend said next is about the best way I can sum this anime up. “Yes you do. You just don't KNOW you want to watch Gurren Lagann right now.” Truer words have never been spoken, because if you're anything like me, this show just looked way too dumb and over the top to be that good, but I will swallow my ignorant pride, and say this is one\n          \n        of the best shows I have ever seen.\nStory: 33/37\nThe story of Gurren Lagann is great. It's possibly (with the exception of one or two moments) one of the most predictable stories out there, but it's amazing. The show is very much a pump-up show for most of it, although there are several incredibly sad and tense scenes, but generally the main characters just kick so much ass that nothing else matters. Honestly, as much as I liked about the series, there isn't a whole lot to say about the story, other than the fact that it was just really well done, or other generic things telling you that it's good... well except for one thing. There is a point in the middle of the series (you could call it it the start of the second season even), where things just... don't fit in the theme of the show. Gurren Lagann is all about manly men kicking manly ass. But there are a few episodes that just break that theme and try to get emotional for the wrong reasons. Luckily, they rectify this and go right on back to beating the baddies soon enough, but it's enough to seriously disrupt the flow of the story. \nCharacters: 28/37\nThis was an incredibly tough score to figure out. On one hand, 99% of the characters, both good and bad, are just incredibly well done. Kamina, Simone who turns into Kamina, and even their nemeses Viral and Lord Genome are amazing. Kamina is the biggest badass in anime, and Simone is right up there at number 2. Even the female lead, Yoko, who looks like she'll just be fan-service central is a great character. So, why does this only get a 30/37? Two reason, one of which is way more important than the other. While this show gets you pumped up with Kamina, Gurren Lagann then introduces one of the worst characters out there: Rossiu. This guy is just a total downer. He never thinks they can succeed (RAGE NOTE: even though the THEME of the entire series is that effort = success. In fact, the driving force for the mechs in the show is fighting spirit), and is just a big whiner. To make matters worse, he becomes one of the most important characters for a while. And then, instead of delivering sweet justice to this cry-baby, they just try to make you feel bad for him. Nope, not gonna happen. \nRant over, the other bad character is the final antagonist in the series. He just isn't that good. It's not enough to matter in the grand scheme of things since the good guys probably just needed more ass to kick, but he's just kind of plain and boring. Oh well, at least Kamina brings the score from Rossiu (1/37), to awesome (28/37). But seriously, watch this just so you can feel like a loser compared to Kamina and Simore, but still become a vicarious badass. \nArt/Sound: 22/25\nThe art in the series is interesting. The style is almost cartoony, and for a show which puts all of its emphasis on combat, they take an almost comic-book like approach to some of their scenes. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but they really don't try to make it look crisp or realistic at all. But at the same time, this style works because the show is just SO ridiculous, and it needs some black line shading under each upper-cut to the enemy face.\nThe sound is great overall, but not particularly amazing. There are a few things that decide sound for me: the opening/ending (more emphasis on the OP), series soundtracks, and voices/sound effects. \nThe OP is absolutely fantastic (even if the second OP is literally just the same thing but with a different visual background), and the ED is nothing special. However, the soundtracks throughout the show are just plain incredible. I still listen to some of them, and they are some of the best out there. If you can honestly listen to and say you don't like Libera me From Hell, then you are sub human. Sound Effects are well done, and do make a difference, and the Voice Actors are all good, with nothing particularly notable.\nRomance: 0/1\nThis section is basically whether or not there was a romance that I enjoyed. Sorry if this is a spoiler, but I particularly enjoy watching a romance develop, and I wished that other reviews would tell me if I was going to get to see one.\nOverall: 83/100\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is pure testosterone. It does almost everything it sets out to do perfectly, from its intense dramatic moments, to its awesome, badass combat. It's definitely a show for all audiences, unless you're especially pretentious and think that all anime should make sense, and this is too over-the-top. There are a few flaws that deduct points from it, some more glaring than others, and those will be mentioned here:\n-Rossiu is one of the worst characters out there.\n-The first couple episodes and the middle couple episodes (mainly the middle ones) aren't up to par.\nIf you have any questions about my review (or want to talk about anything at all, really), feel free to email me at: nickwillis64@gmail.com"},

He is respected by the village elder as the best of the diggers, but is ostracized by his peers. After discovering a special drill key deep in the ground, he is recruited by an eccentric fellow orphan named Kamina into his group, the 'Gurren Brigade'. Kamina dreams of the surface world, which he visited as a child with his father but had to return home because\n          \n        he was too weak to survive.\nAfter a failed attempt at reaching the surface, Kamina is jailed by the elder and Simon resumes digging, only to discover 'a big face' deep in his tunnel. As he excitedly fetches Kamina to show him the discovery, he is caught by the village elder, but Kamina's punishment is interrupted by the ceiling of Giha Village collapsing as an enormous robot falls into the cavern. A girl named Yoko appears and tries to fight the robot with a large rifle, but initially cannot do much. Simon takes Kamina and Yoko to the 'big face' he found earlier and discovers that the small drill key can be used to activate the small robot, which he uses to end up destroying the much larger robot and effectively break through to the surface.\n(From Wikipedia)\nPersonal Opinion\n... wow...\nThis show completely blew me away.\nGurren Lagann is great in almost every aspect. So I guess I'll start with the design.\nIt seems like as the show goes on... the scale of everything also increases, the mecha, the number of characters, and the challenges.  Indeed the first episode is somewhat of a allegory to the rest of the show. People band together, fight using mecha, and overcome an oppressor.  And just as you think that the scale of everything has reached it's limit... they repeat it again with everything even larger... indeed the first shot of TTGL is from the end of the series... and you get a hint of how large everything becomes.\nAs for the plot... yeah... we've seen it before... some unknown rises up and defeats 'the man'... however... what makes it unique is the way that they accomplish this.\nThe characters are also well made... plenty of unique hot headed people with a soft side that we see on occasion. Simon is a great example of this. Early on, we see him completely idolizing Kamina and striving to become exactly like him. However as the story progresses... we start to see his own personality and traits starting to shine... especially when late comer Nia shows up.\nWhat brings it all together are the shots and the soundtrack. The soundtrack also adds to everything... making this show truly epic.\nThis is 100% a space opera that most people will enjoy\nBy about the midseason point it was already proving to be better than Eureka Seven... but by the end... it had completly blown it out of the water.\nDON'T MISS THIS SHOW!!!!\n10/10\nSimilar to...\n- Eureka Seven\nHad a large cast of unique characters, both take place in the future on a ravaged planet. Also both have mysterious aliens\n- FLCL\nSimilar in craziness... although FLCL was more random, TTGL had insane moments in it as well\n- Gundam SEED\nin SEED and TTGL, the main mecha of the series seem to be able to do anything, and have great adaptability.\n- Neon Genesis Evangelion\nSimilarites appeared towards to end... so I won't spoil\n"},

The enterprising Kamina, a young man with a pair of rakish sunglasses and the passion of a fiery sun, befriends Simon and forms a small band of brothers, the Gurren Brigade, to escape the village and break through the ceiling of the cave to reach the surface, which few believe exist.\nThe village elder won't hear of such foolishness and punishes the Brigade.\n          \n        However, when disaster strikes from the world above and the entire village is in jeopardy, it's up to Simon, Kamina, a girl with a big gun named Yoko, and the small yet sturdy robot, Lagann, to save the day.\nThe new friends journey to the world above and find that the surface is a harsh battlefield, and it's up to them to fight back against the rampaging Beastmen to turn the tide in the humans' favor! Pierce the heavens, Gurren Lagann!\nI will say this once again, I dont like mecha. I hardly ever search for anime's that involve giant robots fighting. But this series was recommended to me a dozen or more times, so I decided to take a peek and see what all the fuss was about. And BOY was I glad I did. \nGurren Lagann is the best mecha anime that I have ever seen, that contained almost ever genre out there. Romance, Fighting, comedy (Oh the comedy), drama, depression, and even hints of shoujo. The story line flows really well, even the 7 year time skip in the middle of the story was fixed in just right. \nIt starts off as a slapstick comedy, with two stupid characters who have lived under ground for all of there lives, and one of them just wants to go to the surface. They find a mecha with a face, and use it to get to the surface. When they reach the surface, after battling another mecha,  they meet many friends, and the plot just gets sillier and sillier as it goes on. Slowly but surely the REAL plot forms and more fight scenes are dropped into the picture... And then BAM. A character death brings it all down. The story, the twist in the story the death causes, and depression. For a few episodes you'll be waiting for the other characters to get back into gear as the plot thickens and suddenly its not as funny.  \nI laughed hard, I was on the edge of my seat, and I cried. Yup. If your a softie you just might end up crying. I know I dd. (And so did my sister who watched it with me the other day).\nArt: 10/10\nSeeing as this series came from the creators of FLCL and Evangelion, I was expecting nothing less that fantastic art. And thats exactly what I got! The character designs where my favorite part of the art. I loved Nia's design the best, before and after the time skip. Simon's bothered me though. Even though they were not related, Simon ended up looking exactly like Kamina in the end. Which I didnt like one bit. The Mechs were awesome looking, but The Gurren Lagann Combi looked a little too much like Transformers. The animal designs were great too, I mean, what could be better than a grape hippo? Oh yeah. That would be Viral. (BTW The beast men were AWESOME looking). \nCharacter: 10/10\nI think Gurren Lagann pulled off the best character developments Ive seen in YEARS. Simon started off as a weak coward who relied on his bro too much, but in the end he turned out to be a strong hero who wanted nothing more to fight and protect. His development was the biggest and most significant to the series, since he was the lead. A lof of other characters grew up too. Yoko, Viral, Gimmy, and Rossiu (Who I still hate though...), all went through the same hells Simon did. The development just need a kick start, and the shocking death is what does it. The death also causes a landslide of plot twists and creates the best anime Ive ever watched. \nSound: 10/10\nI didnt recognize a lot of the seiyuu for this series, except Saiga Mitsuki (Since I can spot her voice a mile away lol), so hearing voices i wasnt used to made it even better. The casting couldnt have been done any greater than it was. In fact, Im terrified to hear Yuri Lowenthal ruin Simon's voice in the english dub. BTW Just heard their character songs and WOW. Just amazing. \nThe music by Meg Rock was awesome, as always. Her voice and lyrics fit perfectly for the shows theme, and how it turns out later on. The BGM was cool too, I always have fight the power stuck in my head. \nEnjoyment: 10/10\nI rented this series from the library, so I had a very limited time to watch it. BUT Im glad I watched like I did. It was SO very addicting and I couldnt stop wanting to watch more. I find it strange now that its changed my views that Mecha is all fight no story. \nGive it a spin. *reffering to the Drill theme of the show*. You may love it. XD"},

You need to watch Gurren Lagann.\nGurren Lagann. What a ride it was.\nTo be honest, I'm not a big fan of the mecha genre. I've never seen the big appeal in it, but the animation and action is usually good enough to keep me entertained, even if I don't care for anything else.\nGurren Lagann is a special kind of mecha anime. Not only is the art/animation absolutely phenomenal (as expected in an anime such as this), but\n          \n        so are all the other components. The story is gripping, the sound design (both the ost and voice acting) is great, and the characters are relatable and massively enjoyable. \nStory: 9\nThe story in Gurren Lagann was something special. Gurren Lagann's motto seems to be, based on comments I read in the forums during episodes and my own conclusion, \"Throw logic out the window and do the impossible!\" - and while normally this would be a problem for me, it just seemed to work flawlessly for it. The exaggerated, absurd nature of so many of the things you see makes Gurren Lagann a truly memorable and special show. However, don't think that the story is just purely exaggerated and ridiculous, scenes - there are some surprisingly deep scenes and underlying conflicts that will unfold to shake things up.\nThe first 2/3 of the show are basically setting up most of the characters, providing amazing action and battle scenes, and humor abound. There is a brief lull in the middle where things slow down severely, but it was necessary for the story to progress. Other than those 2 episodes or so, Gurren Lagann moves at a breakneck speed that will leave you speechless and entertained. \nThe final 1/3 of the show is, without a doubt, one of the most epic arcs I've seen in any medium ever. Every episode ratcheted up the tension to unbelievable levels, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. Throughout the course of its 27 episodes, you experience all sorts of battles and trials with the main cast, and by the end, I can guarantee you'll share in both the elated feelings of accomplishment in the face of the greatest odds, and be punched in the stomach by the emotion present in other, simply put, beautiful scenes. While not a sad anime, certain scenes in the last few episodes left me tearing up because of the brilliant art direction, score, writing, and voice acting that formed an amazing combination.\nIAmSovereign said in his review, \"The show that turns boys into men,\" and I have to say that I wholly agree with this statement. At its core, this story is one of growth, of the main character Simon breaking out of his shell as a 14 year old boy and becoming someone else, someone more mature. But he's not the only one to experience growth - basically every significant character throughout the series experiences wonderful and relatable character development, and I can guarantee that by the end, no character is the same as they were when they were first introduced.\nIAmSovereign (go read his review if you haven't, it's very good) also said it best with \"An endlessly thrilling ride from the most humble beginnings to the most fantastic of ends.\" I couldn't agree more with this line. The escalation of the intensity and story is quite remarkable.\nAre there some issues? Sure. Sometimes it feels like the mechas gain certain powers for the sake of advancing the story or convenience for the characters, and some plot devices aren't fully explained (well, they are explained, just much later than one would expect - but at least even some of the crazier things get some logical explanation as the meanings behind things are revealed. It's pretty impressive that just about every absurd plot device/hole is explained later on in a way that makes sense). But when the story is just this much FUN to watch, you can't let these things detract from it too much.\nThe themes throughout the anime are ones of companionship, growth and maturity, and courage and sacrifice, and the way they stay consistently present over the entire duration is truly remarkable. The ways that each character comes to terms with these themes is a joy to watch, and I feel like I myself understand these values more having watched this anime.\nIn summary, Gurren Lagann's story is a fast-paced, breathtaking, enjoyable romp through the space time continuum that can only be summarized in one word: Epic.\nArt/Animation: 9\nThe art in Gurren Lagann is also quite good. The character animations are good, but what really shines in a show such as this are the very frequent battle scenes. The animation in these scenes is spectacular, and left me in awe at some of the pure insanity going on on-screen throughout. Emotion is portrayed well, and every character has a significant trait that defines them. One of the best things about the art direction was the way two main characters were paralleled in design towards the end, and I guarantee it has the potential to choke up even the most toughened veterans of the genre, and anime in general.\nSound: 10\nThe OST in Gurren Lagann is nothing short of amazing. The OP and ED were perfect choices that just ooze epicness every time you hear them. Every time the OP came on, I got pumped up for the inevitable chaos and rollercoaster of a ride that each episode was. The score is perfect - some songs fit more towards funny scenes, others toward serious scenes, others for casual scenes, others for development and speeches, and others for the most epic scale battles of all. As I sit here listening to \"With Your Drill, Pierce The Heavens!\", off the OST (the 3:38 version), I'm on the verge of tearing up as I remember the journey the characters went through, the lives that were lost, and the scenes it was played in (it is a prime example of a perfect OST song). Other standout tracks include \"Viral's Theme\", \"With Your Drill, The Heavens...\" (a beautiful song from one of the most emotional scenes of the entire show), \"Adai Village's Decosuke\", \"Sorairo Days\", and \"To Hell With Gattai\".\nNot only was the OST amazing, but the voice acting was also brilliant. Having compared both the sub and dub, I can say that regardless of which method of watching anime you prefer, you're in for a treat - though I must say that this is one of the best English dubs I've heard - every character was cast absolutely perfectly and brought to life, especially Viral, Simon, Ron, Kamina, and Kittan.\nCharacter: 10\nThe characters of Gurren Lagann were simultaneously some of the funniest, most relatable, and most entertaining characters of any anime I've seen. As mentioned under the story section, there is significant character growth, and the way each character grows and changes will leave you satisfied. The personalities of them are so diverse, and yet each one was perfect in the overall picture. The sheer cast of personalities that make up Team Dai-Gurren leaves me impressed and cheering them on every step of the way.\nThe writing of the characters was amazing, and the dialogue they delivered was nothing short of absolutely spectacular. There are so many quotes that I was jotting down throughout the show, especially in the first few and last few episodes. \"Just who the hell do you think I am?\", \"Believe in the me that believes in you\", \"Let's see you grit those teeth!\", one of the final speeches delivered that I won't post here... all are quotes that will stick with me for a long time. The way certain quotes were repeated over the course of the show, like the three listed above, also just raised the meaning and impact behind them more and more each time.\nI was attached to each and every character, even the minor ones, down to the last seconds of the show and even now, after having finished it. I feel like I can't do justice describing just how wonderful the characters are. You need to watch it to understand how I feel about them.\nEnjoyment: 10\nFrankly, you just need to watch it. This was one of the most entertaining animes I have ever watched, and likely ever will watch. The story is so, so entertaining, the art and animation are amazing, the sound design, from the OST to the voice actors, are perfect, and the characters make up one of the best casts of any anime to date. If any piece of my review has resonated with you or piqued your interest, you owe it to yourself to give Gurren Lagann a shot. You won't regret it.\nOverall: 9.5/10\n(Note: When originally writing the review, I rounded down to a 9, but after the lasting impression it's given me over the past 2 months I've decided to round it to a 10).\n(To the \"helpful\" and \"not helpful\" voters out there, feedback would be appreciated)\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    \"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\", one of the more recent anime series by Gainax shows a return to the giant mecha genre for the studio, but weaves in a lot more crazy ideas and puts it in a way-post apocalyptic setting. While it's in part a straight up light-hearted homage to the sillier elements of giant mecha anime, the film makes an about-face twist halfway through (or possibly one quarter through, depending on your perspective), turning the whole thing into a much more serious affair, while still retaining elements of its sillier side.\nThe initially centers around Simon, an expert digger in an underground village. He's a\n          \n        little weak-willed and cowardly, but, being underground, digging is important and he's the best as it. He's looked after (and dragged into trouble) by his self-appointed \"big brother\" Kamina, a hot- headed, ridiculously self-confident man, who is bent on making his way to the surface. One day, Simon discovers a strange little head with arms and legs while digging, but also gets locked up with Kamina thanks to their plot to escape the village. Then, the vault over their underground township breaks open and down falls a giant malicious looking mecha, which looks like a large mechanical head with some smaller appendages, followed shortly by a scantily-clad, rifle-wielding woman named Yoko. In the panic, Simon and Kamina discover that Simon can somehow pilot the little mecha head, dubbed Gurren, and they destroy the threat and make their way to the surface with Yoko, where they discover that the beastmen have been oppressing or eliminating the humans that attempt to live on the surface. And so begins a journey to make the surface inhabitable by defeating the beastmen and their Spiral King. Or so they think...\nThe overall series has a two-part structure with each half being predictably tonally different, with a more fun and lighthearted first half and a much more serious second half, bridged by a recap episode right in between (by the way, I hate recap episodes). Overall, the series has the simple theme of the hope, drive, desire of the indomitable human spirit, originally embodied in Kamina, which effectively spreads to the other characters. Despite the light-hearted nature of the first half of the series, it doesn't hold back from tragedy and our main characters will see a large share of tragedy before the end of the series, but I appreciate the emotional depth afforded to most of the characters, even as Simon threatens to fall off the boat of caring due to his intense whiny angst a quarter into the series. But he gets better. And the series gets increasingly epic, to universe- threatening levels, a feature found in a number of fantastic science fiction oriented series like Gurren Lagann. Fortunately, the pacing for the series is pretty tight and while there are slower more anthology- oriented episodes, no episode is wasted in terms of moving the overarching story along, especially insofar as it explores the themes as embodied by the different characters that are introduced throughout the stories. The ending fortunately avoids the fate of being a total mindscrew and leaving everything unresolved as Gainax has been known to do, so in that sense, it's a wholly satisfying watch.\nAnd this production is very clearly a Gainax production, boasting absolutely gorgeous art, whether it's being fun, funny or aiming at ultra-cool mecha combat goodness. Like the story, the design aspects are often heavily exaggerated to proportions (especially the size of the mecha Gurren Lagann's drills) that would be laughable if it weren't just so ridiculously awesome at the same time. Likewise, Gainax's non-stop love of fanservice is present in the super-skimpy string bikini that Yoko sports without a reason or rhyme. The artwork style also follows the first/second half division in the story by presenting goofier art in the first half and much more intricate and serious designs in the second, without losing the link between the two.\nI only had the opportunity to watch the English dubbed version and I will admit that the voice acting, especially early on, was quite uneven and sported the same cast of voice actors you hear doing practically every English anime dub ever. I wasn't terribly impressed overall, but it wasn't bad enough to be distracting, although the mixing into the rest of the soundtrack did leave the voices seeming unusually flat. I'm curious to see how the original Japanese soundtrack sounds.\nUltimately, Gurren Lagann is a wild ride. While the story is plenty predictable, borrowing from the larger tropes present in its boy- oriented mecha genre anime, its willingness to just go with its guns and embrace ridiculousness with gusto turns it from being stale exaggerations of the genre to awesomely fun, even if the overall story is simple. And the simple story has merit, making a statement about the power of (not necessarily religious) faith, but not in simple terms, showing both the boons and the losses of a life led in the pursuit of greater things. Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann, then, is everything it aspires to be: one heck of a good time with giant robot battles, shonen- styled melodrama, wacky characters and serious characters, and a willingness to go overboard for the sake of cool. And in its genre, that's better than a lot of its peers can even aspire to. It's not a transcendent work, but it easily earns its praises by providing heaps of fun. Good stuff for people that like boy-centric anime. 9/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="                          \n    *Note, this was written for another forum. \nThis anime is seemingly high praised across the internet, so as this is my first review, I thought I may as well review something that a lot of people have heard of. Let it be known that I will say at least a couple of controversial points in this review. You have been warned.\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann(meaning Heavenly Piercing Crimson Lotus Enveloping Face), follows the story of Símon, a boy from an underground village who finds a mysterious mech(collectively termed \"gunmen\") while digging and is whisked away from his home by the seemingly badass Kamina and a young\n          \n        girl with barely any clothes named Yoko. They're swept along into a resistance force to take down the Spiral King, the guy behind the people being underground in the firs place, with Kamina at the front.\nThe biggest gripe I have with this anime is how juvenile certain parts are, and it's kind of jarring to see these things juxtaposed with some actual mature themes. This is one of those animes where every \"move\" has to have its own special name which must be shouted at the top of their lungs, because everyone knows that when you shout and add random adjectives to things then you automatically do more damage.\nAnother element which I found kind of childish was the fact that near the end of the series, they started to make up a lot of science for no real reason than for the protagonists to somehow break these laws. I wouldn't have minded this, a theme behind the anime is about breaking all barriers, never giving up and confronting things head on, but honestly the science seemed kind of redundant and it didn't make any sense half of the time.\nThen of course is the casual male pandering. The show doesn't even try and hide this. It's jumping up and down shouting \"Look! Boobs!\". Go search for \"Gurren Lagann yoko\" on google and you will see what I mean. I would say that this anime is being incredibly self aware and is actually poking fun at shounen anime in general with it's childish elements, but it comes across as a little too stupid for that.\nHowever, the show confronts these childish elements and uses it to it's own advantage, to create an emotional impact on the viewer. You expect everything to always be great, but then bam! Something happens and of course I'm not going to disclose what, but because the anime has been kind of childish up until that point, it will hit you like a hammer.\nNow, lets get to the technical elements behind Gurren Lagann. The art has some truly impressive moments, the animation is great throughout the anime(aside from episode 3 which was animated by somebody else) and this all culminates into a pretty awesome looking anime.\nOn the musical side of things, all I have to really say about this is \"ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER!\". Just remember that line, you'll hear it, and it will be awesome. A kind of mix between rap and opera, and interestingly, it actually works.\nA worthy note would also be the voice dubbing. If you're going to watch this program, you may as well watch the dub, because it has one of the most impressive lineups of voice actors I've seen in a long time. I was going to give you a list to probe my point but it ended up being too long so I deleted it. Needless to say, if you've ever watched Code Geass, Ergo Proxy, Naruto, Bleach, Durarara!!!, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya or a load of others than you will notice recognise a lot of the voice acting cast.\nThis sounds like a pretty mixed review. Did I like it? Simply put, yes. It wasn't deep or really moving at all to me, but it was interesting and moved at a fast enough pace that you'll never get bored. It's technically great and the story is quite good(if you've ever read the Mistborn Trilogy by Brandon Sanderson, you'll find the story oddly reminiscent).\nThis anime is not without it's flaws. It's not as good as some people on this site make it out to be, but it is definitely worth a watch.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Let first of all tell a little story. Im on the Internet on the website anime news network. i seen TTGL with a high score. On a anime forum i see people talking about this and say how much the like this. i also say 'i never seen a ep of TTGL' then someone else quotes that and says 'i hate you. until you watch TTGL'. A also went here and i saw that TTGL is ranked as the best anime as all time. Then before i started to watch i said this on the forum 'you guys overrated TTGL so much it makes GTA\n          \n        4 look like nothing' when i finished i thought to my self 'boy was i right'\nI really dont see what TTGL has done to make everyone like it so god damn much. and dont believe the lie of this place is not the best anime ever made. Anyway lets start reviewing \nStory: The year is XXXX on planet X which later turns out to be earth. Mankind lives underground in small villages fore some reason. Everyone seem to be fine with this but not everyone.Villages have no contact with the surface world or other villages. Because frequent earthquakes damage infrastructure, the villages must constantly extend deeper into the earth &mdash; individuals relegated to this task are known as diggers. In your story we follow Simon from Giha Village. A 14 year old kid who&acute;s parents died in a earthquake. Should also mention hes the best driller in the village .One day he finds a drill key and decides to keep it. Not long after that we are introduced to Kamina. Kamina dreams of the surface world, which he once visited as a child, though he had too return home as he was too weak to survive there. So he get some crazy as plan to get to the surface and he needs Simon&acute;s drill to help him with that. And it fails. Kamina goes to prison while Simon goes back to digging. He later find a face in the tunnel and the key he found reacts weird.Simon gets happy as hell and he watns to show Kamina the discovery, Simon is also caught by the village elder. Fortuitously, Kamina's punishment is interrupted by the collapse of the ceiling over Giha Village, as an enormous robot falls into the cavern. A girl named Yoko appears and tries to defeat the machine with a large rifle, but to no avail. Simon takes Kamina and Yoko to the 'big face' he found earlier and discovers that the small drill key can be used to activate a small robot, named 'Lagann', which he uses to destroy the invading robot and effectively break through to the surface. and then some stuff we dont care about and he get to know that the big robots are called Gunmen&acute;s that are piloted by things called Beastmen. .We get to know that Beast men takes order from 'the Hexer King' also the Best men kill any humans that get up to the surface. Kamina later get his one robot and then decided to go with Simon and defeat the king so that human can live on the ground.\nAnd thats all the story im going to give you. Its not anything new and groundbreaking it just fucking standards. Moving on now it time fore characters\nSimon: a 14 year old kid we dont care about. Yet he&acute;s the main character. But he makes a good work out of it but he&acute;s dont know how to stand up fore him self so he takes order from everyone. But somewhere after ep 5 something will happen and it will make him a better character. It will get tougher and he will become a good leader \nKamina: He&acute;s a GAR. do i need to say anything more? well yes. He is extremely impulsive, His plans are rarely well thought-out, often relying solely on brute strength and determination to win, but for some strange reason or another, they seem to work most of the time. It is revealed that Kamina's impulsive confidence is mostly a show to give Simon the courage to act. He believes that in reality, all he can do is give Simon the motivation to 'reach the heavens'; he couldn't do it himself. To Simon he is the symbol of courage and determination.\nYoko: A really hot big breasted girl. Like we haven't seen that before. anyway Yoko. Yoko is a really skilled with the a rifle that and she falls in love with a character later on in the story. She is useful to the story and ....well thats about it. \nThere are more character&acute;s but these 3 are the main one. And yes the characters are great and all but its nothing new. It just stereotypical Shōnen characters.\nArt: Now here is a thing that makes TTGL one of a kind. the animation. it new and it fells good watching it fore the 26 times as it was fore the first. \nSound: Now the soundtrack could have been better. i like the opening song and thats about it. There are some other tracks that i should mention like the one where they say 'row row fight the power' but its hip hop and i hate hip hop. \nEnjoyment: ok this might be what is making everyone like TTGL. Even after all these problems i mention it still enjoyably as hell. Sure the fight fell&acute;s like the where taken from a Gundam but due too animation and sound it makes them really fucking good to watch. the characters are stereotypical but the way the act, talk and the relationships makes it fun to watch. \nOverall: 8/10. Its full of stereotypical and soundtrack could have been better. But its still enjoyably as hell. Its fun to watch and the last fight is the only thing thats one of a kind in this anime. Also remember this is not the best anime ever made. There are better like Neon Genesis Evangelion, Monster or Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen. How people can think that this anime is the best anime of all time will always be a mystery in my head\n        "},

Reader Discretion is advised.\nCritic's Log - Earthdate: March 12, 2013. Review #39: Gurren Lagann\nA year ago, I wrote my first review and posted it. That review was Cowboy Bebop. Soon after, I started writing, posting, and doing more reviews ever since. A year has passed and I plan on continuing this hobby of mine. This review I have now is for an anime that has broken through the surface with its badass style and strives to PIERCE THE HEAVENS! THAT ANIME IS\n          \n        GURREN LAGANN!\nWith that said, here's my review of Gurren Lagann! JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM!?\n\nIn their closed-off underground village known as Jeeha Village, Kamina and Simon (pronounced \"Shi-moan\" in Japanese and \"See-Moan\" in the Dub) attempt to break out of the underground at the limits imposed by the village elder because Kamina is determined to make it to the surface. The attempt fails and Kamina is sent to the underground's stockade without food and Simon is let go because it was obviously not his idea. Yet all this will change, when Simon stumbles across a big metal face - just as the village's peace is broken by a violent intrusion. A gigantic Gu... You know what, I'm ending the little plot sypnosis right here and now, I'm going to tell you the more technical stuff and all the juicy bits too.\n\n\nTo be technical, Gurren Lagann is a Studio Gainax production and you can tell that they are shoving this anime at your face to the heavens and it works. The animation is badass and kicks ass when it can in ridiculous over-the-top proportions. It's so over the top that it's proportions of being over the top is over the heavens. Okay, spare me for just saying that. To make things easier to explain, the animation is really cool and it doesn't waste a second of the show's length, except for one particular portion of the series... and that is Episode 4: Does Having So Many Faces Make You Great? I don't know if it's just me or something... but the facial expressions are drastically different than the previous three episodes that came before it and this is the only episode that has this...Thank God.\nI can honestly say this while trying hard not to piss off the fanbase for saying this but... I felt the facial expressions in that episode were terrible and this is quickly redeemed with the episodes that follow. putting personal nitpicks aside, The animation is vibrant, energetic, and in your face that you would not care if the animation had some quirks like...Episode 4 for an example. The animation will simply kick your ass and will make you cheer with indominable spirit after watching certain spectacles known as \"moments\". To put it simply, the animation is a blast and ridiculously entertaining.\n\nThe music by Taku Iwasaki contributes in all that \"In your face\" attitude that the show carries. The way the music is done in this show is astounding and definitely worth listening to with or without the show. There's some techno, hip-hop, rock, orchestra, and it even has a little jazz. The music will grab your attention and it succeeds full-front on that. Taku Iwasaki really struck all the chords right on Gurren Lagann and has had a pretty good resume ever since. He would later be the composers of such animes like Soul Eater, and Black Butler. Extra kudos goes to Iwasaki-san for combining Opera, piano, and Hip-hop all in one song during a particular moment in the show. I mean, Opera, with piano and hip-hop really don't mix too well. It just so happens that the impossible was made possible in this show. The opening is catchy and the closings are also great in the show.  The soundtrack is great and pierces some unconventional barriers in one particular moment.\n\nWhen it comes to voice acting, The Japanese cast is pretty damn good. Katsuyuki Konishi is terrific as Kamina, Tetsuya Kakihara is also terrific as Simon, Marina Inoue is pretty good as Yoko. Yukari Fukai is great as Nia, Mitsukia Saiga is also great as Rossiu, and Nobuyuki Hiyama is a blast to hear as Viral (pronounced \"Vee-ral\") The standout extras in the subbed version include Kisho Taniyama as Kittan, Masaya Onasaka as Leeron, Jouji Nakata as Magin, and Michiko Neya as Adiane (pronounced \"A-dee-neigh\"). On the English Dub side. Kyle Hebert is terrific as Kamina but he does lack the energetic manly passionate attitude that Kamina's seiyu nailed in just right. If there is someone that got the attitude right, it would be Yuri Lowenthal as Simon and he plays the role terrificly. Michelle Ruff is great as Yoko. Hynden Walch is... *Record Scratch* Wait... The voice of Starfire from Teen Titans? SHE'S ON HERE!? *Ahem* Hynden Walch is great as the younger Nia while Bridget Hoffman is also great playing the older Nia. Johnny Yong Bosch is also pretty damn good as Rossiu, and Sam Regal is alright as Viral and his performance is drastically different comparing Viral's Seiyu. I'll let you be the judge of who you like better. The standout extras in the dub are Jamieson Price as Lordgenome, Paul St. Peter as The village chief in the first episode and Thymilph, Derek Stephen Prince as Artenborough, and then of course there's Steve Blum\n\n(Duhuhuhuh *shiver*) Yeah, Steve Blum... and he voices Leeron. I am not lying when I say this, his voice creeped me out when I first saw and heard this guy and my mind was blown at the time when I found out that Steve Blum voiced this flamboyant gentleman. I mean, he was the badass voice of Spike Speigel from Cowboy Bebop, Darcia from Wolf's Rain, and many other roles before and since. The guy is pretty damn talented and he sure made the character funny whether you were uncomfortable or bursting with laughter. The Japanese cast is great and so is the dub for what it is. Tony Oliver may have not made the English dub superior to the Japanese cast but he did do a superb job as the ADR director for this dub.\n\nThe characters themselves don't disappoint greatly. Kamina (in some way) is a badass and he's also damn hilarious when he gets some funny moments. When I watched this the first time, I actually found him to be a total douche, But that was because I was watching this dubbed in which Kamina's seiyu didn't really portray him as a douche all that much. But as time came by, I actually found him pretty cool. Simon is a character that's easy to latch on to. Yoko is obviously in the show for fanservice but that was intentional from the beginning but she has some good qualities in her character. Rossiu is an interesting case, and so is Viral. Nia is also an adorable character during the first half. Other characters that are great would have to be Lordgenome (because he's kinda cool) and Leeron (because he's really damn funny at times), and Kittan (Because he was a bit of a douche but got away of it for being a douche, he was also pretty cool too). Like I said, the characters don't disappoint greatly. The characters make the show extremely watchable.\n\nNow that I've mentioned that Gurren Lagann has cool animation, a great soundtrack, A great Japanese cast, a solid dub, and extremely memorable characters. I have to address one thing about a certain factor in this anime and that would be the story. If you are to take the story seriously, you are screwed...WITH DRILLS! To be perfectly honest, the story is extremely dumb in epic proportions. Here's the catch! IT WAS INTENTIONAL! In a metaphorical sense, this show shouts out \"FUCK LOGIC!\" and it even plays the Deus Ex Machina card a few times. The use of cliches is also intentional as well. Hell! The fanservice is also intentional that even drills will get a hard-on. It even has EXPLOSIONS! That's right, Gurren Lagann has both fanservice and explosions and this anime could possibly put Michael Bay to shame. The premise and approach is extremely a bit silly and over-the-top but what this anime promises is that it will get guys to cheer on for the characters. Another strength to Gurren Lagann is its humor, this show has some really damn funny moments as well as funny one-liners.\n\nSpeaking of one-liners, this show does tend to get quoted quite often from people after they see the show, so expect someone to say \"Just who the hell do you think I am?\" at a convention or from one of your friends that has seen the show. Even with the story having a silly over-the-top approach and premise while being actually decent, what I find astounding about Gurren Lagann is that even with a ridiculous premise, the creative staff still found a way to make it extremely entertaining with an apparent passionate mindset of making the impossible possible. When it comes to the writing process, this would be one hell of an accomplishment for Kazuki Nakashima. I should also note that the director of the show Hiroyuki Imaishi had a bit of a interesting resume after I did a little research. Before he directed Gurren Lagann, he was the key animator for the movie The End of Evangelion, and the second and fifth episode of FLCL. Both Gainax works yes, but FLCL and Gurren Lagann were both extremely over-the-top in their premises and I guess Imaishi-san was a fitting director for this show. Now that I've said that, I should say one more thing before I start wrapping up this review. So, here goes! *ahem* If Rainbow Dash is 20% Cooler, then Gurren Lagann is 20% Epic, 20% Badass, 20% silly and 20% more cooler than Rainbow Dash. If Kamina were a pony, he would easily be the best pony out there. Also, I'm a Brony. and if you got a problem with it, JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM!?\n\nGurren Lagann was available from Bandai Entertainment until they went under. Unfortunately it went out of print. The manga written by Kazuki Nakashima and illustrated by Kotaro Muri was available by Bandai Entertainment and it was dropped because Bandai Entertainment went under. The manga is also out of print here. The light novel series written by Kurasumi Sunayama and illustrated in parts by Hiroko Shinagawa was never released stateside. A couple Gurren Lagann video games were also never released stateside. Last, but not least, there are two compilation movies of Gurren Lagann that have some moments and additions that were never in the series with the first movie called \"Childhood's End\" and the second being named \"The Lights in the Sky are Stars\" are available from Aniplex USA.\n\nWith all that said, Gurren Lagann is obviously a guy's anime, there's just a lot of elements that are very manly. Besides that, it has pumped-up energetic animation, A great soundtrack, A great Japanese cast, a solid English dub, extremely memorable characters, Kickass action scenes and EXPLOSIONS! and hilarious humor. Gentlemen, this is an anime to watch with your heart and not your mind, and certainly not your dick... Ladies, this is an anime to watch with your heart, not your mind, and definitely not your boobs.\n\nI give Gurren Lagann a 9.8 out of 10, it is EXCELLENT!\n\nFeel free to leave a comment, and believe in the you that believes in you! \n        "},

If you view it after you have seen the classic shows of super robot anime (Mazinger series, Getter Robo, etc) or even lesser known super robot work (Zambot 3 especially in this case) you see a series that a lot of times feels as if they took one idea from one show\n          \n        one idea from another and just combined them.

Normally I wouldn't attempt a review in this state, but i just want to express what an amazing experience TTGL was while it is still fresh. So, without further adieu, here goes nothing..\n\nThe story in TTGL was simply phenomenal. It honestly took me from beginning to end, entranced by the ongoing passage into maturity that Simon embarked upon from that faithful day drilling in Jiiha village. \nThe thing I enjoyed\n          \n        most about the story was how it went from absolute simplicity in the beginning to the grandeur of the final few episodes. It is truly a work of art in the respect that it accomplishes this feat in such few episodes and remains very true to the storyline and quite fluid for the most part. \nI must say I'm also a fan of the lack of filler episodes present. As the majority of anime I've watched as of late are a concoction of great episodes true to a main story line wrapped neatly in a mountain of fillers. TTGL is not. Each episode, with the exception of possibly two, are vital to commit your attention to if there is any hope of following the fairly complicated, ever-evolving plot. In all, TTGL is a prime example of the phrase, 'Why write a paragraph when you can say the same thing in a sentence'. \n Gurren-Lagann is a mech-based anime, which I'm not the biggest fan of, but it didnt feel like a confined mech anime to me. There are heaps of humor, drama, mech-less action, and an overwhelming concept of the infinite power of human beings. \nOne of the only problems I found while watching TTGL was its lack of loveable characters. Maybe this is just me, but I found myself asking, 'Who is this person again?' often toward the end of the series for many of the characters in the main cast. Although, those I found worthwhile were very demensional and undoubtedly well-developed.\nOverall, any fan of mechs, drama, adventure, action, large scale battles, and anime in general should devote some time to Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann. It is fair to say that it is the epiphany of anime fan's goals for what an anime should consist of a presents these concepts very well. Needless to say, TTGL is a true masterpiece.\n        "},

While I think there's no doubt about this show's status, It's smarter than people give it credit for. I often hear Gurren Lagann described as a \"dumb feel-good series.\" and have heard plenty of reviews say that there isn't much depth to the show, despite it's entertainment value. I can't disagree more. While the show does excel at being a fun and outright inspiring adventure show, it has some deeper philosophical commentary that I found hard to not catch on to in the later episodes. Its not like 2001 space odyssey philosophical (thank god) and I wouldn't call it\n          \n        perplexing in anyway, it just struck me as not what people told me about the show.

I could write an essay on this, but I'm a college drop out, so I'm not about to write an essay ever again.  \nNot a particularly indept review, but I don't see the point in one when every anime focused youtuber already has a video on this show. Just wanted to throw in my 2 cents that this show has a little more depth than it leads on. \n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    This review has spoilers. Since TTGL is incredibly well loved in the anime community with most people rating it a fun/10, I would suggest that anyone who wants to watch the show to definitely watch it before reading this review. \nTTGL begins with one of the most chaotic pilot episodes ever, similar to Space Dandy. The show sets the rules and tone early; there is a lot of action and comedy with little logic. After defeating their first enemy gunman by yelling and throwing themselves recklessly at it, the adventure begins with our main trio; Kamina, Simon and Yoko.\nKamina embodies the main themes of the\n          \n        show; courage, bravery and confidence against all odds. His lack of intelligence allows for plenty of jokes and comedy, making Kamina the most entertaining character. Some people may dislike Kamina because of his constant yelling and stupid ideas, but he is used by the show to be the hero that everyone strives to be. If you find yourself disliking Kamina you might struggle to enjoy the rest of the show.\nOn first impression, Simon is a shy kid who looks up to Kamina, while Yoko is a scantily clad teenager with a giant sniper rifle. As a trio for the first few episodes it's entertaining watching them take on bigger and harder foes in a comedic fashion while gaining new fighting abilities with each episode. When they're losing a battle, all they have to do is believe in themselves and they gain some new power to win the battle and come out unscathed.\nThese episodes all lead up to the epic battle of episode 8. Here is where the show makes what I believe is a decision for the worse. At the end of episode 8, Kamina dies. Now, I have no problem with characters dying, however it is clear that this death was done for a symbollic reason only (for Simon the step out of his shadow). But without Kamina, 90% of the comedy in the show is lost. Hence, TTGL becomes less enjoyable. \nKamina's replacement is Nia; the pure-hearted daughter of Lord Genome, who for no reason at all, has complete faith in Simon's abilities to save the world. Similar to Kamina, she isn't very perceptive so there is some comedy from that, but these moments are rare. However, other than being Simon's cheerleader, she doesn't really do anything other than provide an exposition dump in the later episodes. It also doesn't help that her inclusion takes focus away from Yoko who's character seemed to be going somewhere. \nAfter having seemingly won the war, TTGL then makes an odd decision to have a time skip and a sudden weird shift in tone. For approximately 5 episodes TTGL attempts to become a serious drama, conflicting with everything that has happened beforehand. These episodes have no place in the show and actually seem more nonsensical than the battles beforehand (for example, blaming Simon for the antispiral invasion of Earth after he just saved everyone from them). This especially feels out of place when it is followed by a mech-fight involving throwing galaxies around. Some of the characters change completely for no reason (and the show even pokes fun at this in one scene). All these factors put together make these episodes seem like a completely different show. The attempt to be serious and add variety to the show is appreciated, but it did not work in this case.\nIf there is one thing the show did right, it is the animation. From beginning to end, the animation in TTGL is insanely impressive. The mech battles are spectacular with an incredible array of colours and quick movement. This is backed up by a score that will have you feeling pumped up in every scene. Of course, the iconic \"Row Row Fight The Powah\" must be mentioned since it has managed to capture the love of every fan of TTGL (myself included). \nHowever, even with the well choreographed mech battles, the fights end up being repetitive. The stakes increase but it's the same formula; enemy is cocky, enemy starts losing, enemy gets serious, Simon starts losing, mechs fuse, Simon wins. Hence, the final battles are straightforward to the viewer. This doesn't mean the show would be better off without the second half since it does add to the plot. \nHaving said that, the new perspective the second half brings to the show has its problems. To claim Lord Genome was simply jaded after losing the war with the antispiral doesn't explain why he created evil generals to \"keep humans safe\". This is the problem with the narrative, and symbolism use in TTGL; everything is done in extremes. The idea of coming out of the shadow of a role model to be yourself is a great message, but it doesn't require the death of the role model for that to happen. The message of falling in love with the right person has good intentions, but it doesn't mean the character needs to have 100% blind faith in the protagonist to show they're a good fit. If these aspects were dialed back the messages would have more impact due to being more grounded.\nTTGL is a series that is fun enough to keep almost any anime fan watching. It is a mech/shonen with a little more depth and uniqueness while having amazing animation and sound. For most anime fans, this is more than enough, which can be seen by how highly rated this show is. Therefore I would recommend this show to every fan of action. Younger teens will especially enjoy this more simply due to being able to better identify with Simon.\n"},

It's often disregarded as just a fun, dumb, manly show, but I think there's a lot more to it than that.

I've never seen anything like it, and, (with the exception of Kill la Kill) i don't think we'll see anything else like this again any time soon. \nGurren Lagann is, in short, pure, unadulterated over the top insanity, mixed with themes of the transition between childhood and adulthood, and even a little bit of philosophy (i kid you not, Google \"the Cave Philosophy\")\nThe show's message is simple: You can do anything you set your mind to. However, weather than getting all sappy over this moral, TTGL delivers it with an extra helping of \"Fuck you, I\n          \n        do what I want.\" \nThe story Focuses on Simon (SEE-MOH-N), a young boy raised in a very \"City of Ember\"-like underground village. Simon, at the beginning of the series, is reminiscent of Shinji, the protagonist of Gainax's OTHER insanely popular Mecha series, Neon Genesis Evangelion. He's Shy, easily frightened, and doesn't know how to stand up for himself. TTGL is the story of Simon Going from some awkward kid living in a hole in the ground, to being a world wide symbol of hope, and eventually the universe's hero. \nThis show is completely Over the Top. That being said, it's not written realistically. It requires the viewer to suspend their disbelief a bit to fully enjoy it, but the payoff is immense. \n        "},

It constantly dances on the line between awesome and utterly ridiculous.  The story is total nonsense--there are no rules or structure to how anything works.  It's all magical pseudo-science, and the more determined you are, the more butt you will kick and the more magical power you will have.  Both obstacles and solutions seem invented on the spot by the writers.  The characters are mostly walking archetypes with a few minor tweaks to make them more interesting.  The emotions fall a\n          \n        bit flat, and big tragic parts tend to come and go with only a ripple in the pond.\nAnd yet, despite all of that, it's still somehow watchable.  I think you have to give a lot of credit to the sense of humor, which pokes fun at the very tropes it relies on, to the fantastic music, and most of all, to the excellent art design and animation.  The best word for it all is kinetic.  Gurren Lagann's infectious enthusiasm comes through in all aspects of the production, absolutely carrying a show which defies any kind of positive analysis of the story or writing.\nIf you're in the mood for some junk food, turn off your brain and turn on Gurren Lagann.  If you're looking for a series which even attempts to have a serious storyline, look elsewhere.\n        "},

Honestly, not sure.\nStory : 7\nTTGL is pretty... nuts, frankly.

Nothing outstanding but it complemented the anime.\nCharacter : 7\nI like a lot of the character tropes used, but honestly... it's basically a cut and paste job from every shounen ever- and sometimes even within TTGL itself. The creators have at least tried to deepen several of the characters by giving them meaningful relationships but they've basically failed at any kind of realistic character development. Even Simon, who starts off as a wonderful character in Part One, develops... into an exact copy of his hero. The anime doesn't even acknowledge this! But surely everyone IRL would be concerned if a boy, absolutely destroyed by grief, deals with it by essentially BECOMING the person he's grieving. By Part Two's end, 3-4 characters might as well be That Person's replicas. Anyway, I like that character so I shouldn't complain but when all the characters are starting to act the same...\nEnjoyment : 8\nNot gonna lie - almost dropped it a few times in Part One, but I'm a sucker for major space battles and mecha.

It's imaginative, cartoon-esq, and generally speaking, a lot of fun!\nThe premise is Gurren Lagann's strong suit, as i found the underground beginning, and the way that such large congregations could simply be unaware of the antics that go on \"where the sun shines\", to be genuinely intreeging. It all invokes a sense of wonder, that captures the attention, particularly of our childish side. So at a glance, the whole thing seems to shape up pretty well.\n          \n        \"Mechas, Action, Comedy, Vibrant art, What more could you want?\" is something i remember quoting about it...\nBut after the novelty of all of this wonderment wore off in 5 episodes, i came to realize that i did want more, and that the show was severely lacking in many areas. Now, readers should be advised, that with Gurren Lagann, it's usually a love/hate scenario; but although i didn't love it, i can definitely appreciate its overriding fantasy appeal - which is why i don't despise it either. \nGurren Lagann is a show that doesn't take itself too seriously, and i mean that in every tone of voice. From what i would consider, a relevant amount of watch time, i came to find that i retained little to no attachment between episodes. Even at emotional landmarks where a more sensitive approach would be appropriate, Gurren Lagann's seizure-esq, headache-inducing, action-packed, comical animated style drowns out the possibility of feeling much sentiment, or impact - that isn't the impact of a Mecha slamming into another. This is because EVERYTHING is presented in an immediate scope, to satisfy the thrill seekers, and appease the action fans, and generally, the show progresses too fast for one to be able to properly process all of the \"what's, why's, how's\" and emotional stances incorporated. (kind of like how you were about to suffocate due to that last sentence's extensive length)\nI feel that there is a distance between the viewer, and all of the characters besides Simon - who's character development is the best, as he's relatable and realistic. As for almost everything else though, in my opinion, GAINAX for whatever reason decided to rush through almost everything. In an attempt to maximize the show's intensity, and with little regard to setting the scene - immersing the viewer more. Crucially, this rushing meant cutting corners with the introduction of not only each character, but even the setting... As there's always so much going on, so much jumping into battle that you don't get a sense of the world's atmosphere, and the cast's personalities beyond the war aspect.\nFor me, this all created a distance between myself, the characters, and even the premise that i was initially taken by. I can appreciate the abundant action, and the creativity, but as i couldn't really \"get into\" or \"become attached to\" any part of the show... Characters and the Very one dimensional story line included; i saw no reason to continue, as nothing told me, \"hey, this getting good, let's watch more!\".\nEssentially, the overriding childishness of the show kills the deeper, passionate, often motivational deeper meanings...\n"},

For me, that is Tengen Toppa... That is Gurren Lagann! A ridiculous series about shouting morons piloting gigantic robots.\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a tale of becoming the master of your own destiny. The cheezyness of the show and how it embraces that makes its cliche message all that more heartwarming and motivational. Gurren Lagann weaves its narrative around its characters, using them as a drill for digging it's way to your heart. Breaking\n          \n        down these drill parts makes you realize how it uses very common archetypes, but builds extremely believable characters around them. Take Simon for example; A shy kid growing into a man who never looks back, yet understands how he got where he is, never letting go of the memories those made him the person that he is. Even the supporting characters are incredibly detailed, most of them could have been half as developed and still have passed as great. The depth behind each character and even more so the development of all of them makes the character section of Gurren Lagann top notch.\nThe show is most often said to consist of two story acts, the first half and the second one starting at episode 17. However, I disagree since dividing the show in three arcs, each representing a character central to Simon's growth makes more sense. Kamina is Simon's soulbrother, kicking his adventure into motion with burning passion. The first arc of the show makes Kamina almost seem the main character. But the one who gives meaning to his empty bravado is Simon, later realizing the errors in Kamina's way and surpassing him. The second story-arc focuses on Simon's second love interest after the first crush of his wasn't interested in him, in favor of Kamina. The romance-side of Gurren Lagann is never the central focus, but instead lingering in the background almost the whole way through. The third arc happens after a 7 year timeskip. If used carelessly, it's a cheap plot device developing characters and their situations, without actually doing so. Gurren Lagann pulls this off great. The characters have matured during the 7 year time while nothing too interesting has happened. When things start going south, the show's focus shifts from BOOBIES and EXPLOSIONS and AWESOMENESS into a more of a subtle commentary on the human condition. The show still feels essentially the same, but grows far more interesting. And then the final 5 episodes feel like pure GAR again, while retaining the slight maturity gained during the last arc in the background. Although it is still a shonen saturday morning cartoon, even if in Japan only.\nOn the technical side of things the show is solid. There is an episode long dive in the quality of the visual side of things, but when the show looks good, damn... It looks soooo vibrant and alive. The character designs are simple but extremely memorable. Even the mechas look organic enough for punchy comedic effects, while still retaining the mechanical detail. That makes watching them explode and lose limbs all that more satisfying. The OST of the show does the impossible, combining the usual symphonic soundtracky stuff with rap, jazz, rock and even opera into a delightful mixture of different vibes and moods. A memorable OST for sure. Both the japanese and the english dubs are solid, blahblah all is great I promise!\n\nScoring breakdown\nArt Section 7/10 (5% Of the overall)\nGeneral Artwork 4/5, Animation 3/5 \nSound Section 8/10 (15% of the overall)\nVoice Acting 4/4, Music 3/4, Effects 1/2\nStory Section 10/10 (40% of the overall) \nPremise and its execution 4/4, Pacing 3/3, Conclusion 3/3\nCharacter Section 10/10 (40% of the overall)\nPersonalities 5/5, Developement 5/5\nOverall Score: 9.55\nGurren Lagann is the best anime, no the best thing ever. Never has any other piece of media made me cry and laugh so hard, or bad, never has any other piece of work make me analyze it on a weekly basis, even only if in my own head. I have watched the series 4 times, and I plan doing so again. The show has genius narrative and succeeds at saving ani... succeeds at everything it seems to try pulling off. A modern classic for sure.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    I just have to thank the team behind Gurren Lagann for doing me a favor. In 27 episodes, I have re-experienced a great deal of my favorite childhood moments. It has moved me in a way I haven't been moved for a very, very long time. For someone who's seen many of the highs and lows of anime/cartoons that's a very tall order to fulfill.\nGurren Lagann knows what it is and doesn't deviate much from it's intent. It's an awfully childish indulgence, but one that you shouldn't pass up. If you aren't completely repulsed by mecha, and still have some ability to be a kid\n          \n        again, then do so for that kid's sake. Don't compare this to Evangelion, don't expect it to be better than Scryed or worse than Full Metal Panic.. just let it do it's thing and entertain you.\nLet yourself indulge, \"kick reason to the curb\" and tell your adult self to shut up for a while. Be that little kid again who anxiously awaited next week's episode of your favorite anime or cartoon. The kid in you will be happy, sad, angry, anxious and thrilled (often all in the same episode). The adult in you might also smile a little, even if it's to see how far you've come since you were a kid.\nTruth be told, almost everything conspires against Gurren Lagann. It has some blaise early episodes and way too much \"stuff\" is going on (too many characters, too much story at once, etc etc). It also has some slightly excessive eccentricities that can border on the distasteful for people who are too sensitive to excessive fanservice (ie, onsen episodes) or the occasional trophic homophobic reaction. But who really cares when you are having this much fun? I'm willing to forgive a series it's few low points when there so many highs.\nProduction-wise, everything is where it needs to be. Everything seems engineered for maximum emotional impact. The music is cued and suits the mood incredibly well so that it helps pull at your heartstrings. The visuals and \"artistic flare\" are also very effective and tend to suit the moment. The plot is so insanely arrogant and stupid that it collapses under it's own ambition to form a singularity of win and awesome.\nThe characters are purposely one-dimensional, yet feel more three-dimensional than they probably deserve. Perhaps that's because they are intended to *epitomize* heartwarming stereotypes, not transcend them. If you give them a chance to do what they are designed to do, you might actually start to care about them and what they represent.\nBut what gets me the most is that while the kid in me was greatly entertained throughout, the adult in me actually cried during the last episode when Simon realized what his victory would cost him. I also almost cried a second time in the ending teaser when you see the aged version of Simon gracefully accept that his role is over.\nAfter the rollercoaster ride, Gurren Lagann still had the decency to bring me back to reality with a suitably epic ending. It had the tact to end up more than a mere kid's show, and not make me feel like I had wasted 27 episodes of time just for a cheap thrill. Frankly I appreciate that, even if many other people don't seem to like an ending that doesn't cheapen the \"values\" the show was constantly rubbing in your face.\nOverall, watching Gurren Lagann for the first time I realized how much I genuinely miss well-done cheeseball action stories. You are completely missing the point if aren't watching this like a kid hungrily waiting for the next week's episode of their favorite show.\nFor being able to entertain both the child and adult in me, and satisfy both of them, I cannot give this show anything less than a 9. The kid in me wants to give it a 10, the adult in me wants to give it a 7, and I think I'll let the kid win for a change!\nPS: The OSTs are fantastic, I'd rather them up there with Cowboy Bebop and FLCL. \"Omae no XXX de ten wo tsuke\" is phenomenal!"},

First and foremost, this series is just a ton of fun. It is always entertaining and always manages to never repeat itself. The animation and action is UNBELIEVABLY FANTASTIC. Its not Gundam or Evangelion type mech action, instead, its more like FLCL mech action. The animation styly is simple and stylized at the same time, and watching it in motion is fascinating and beautiful. Let me put it to you this way, the action is so epic, that the final battle of the series, makes the word epic, sound irrelevant.\nNext, the plot\n          \n        is outstanding. It's not like a philosophical Eva type plot, but it manages to be both original (particurally during the second half of the show) and familiar at the same time. Most of all, its just really exciting. The characters are all really likeable, even the villians. Simon, Kamina, Yoko, and Nia are all VERY good leads, each with their own flaws and uniqueness. Even the supporting characters are all well defined and original. Rossiu becomes more and more interesting as the series goes on, as does Viral, one of the top-ranked Beastmen (Ganmen pilots). The characters all evolve at a natural pace and are all great.\nIts almost impossible to really say what's wrong with Gurren Lagann, if there is. Um...episode 16 is a recap episode, so its kinda useless, and it may take some people 3-4 episodes to be really sold on this series. But other than that, I really can't say there's anything wrong with this anime.\nIn conclusion, Gurren Lagann ranks right up with FullMetal Alchemist, Spirited Away, and Death Note as on of the top 5 best animes of this decade. It doesnt do anything radical, but it is done in a very unique way and it is so incredibly well executed, you wont even care. This ranks in my top 10 anime of all time easily.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    After hearing everyone tell me how good this was, I decided to watch it. And it is a good anime...just it is not the greatest anime. \nThe story is a story about a young boy named Simon and his \"bro\" Kamina. They meet Yoko, and the trio start fighting mechas and whatnot. The series proceeds brainlessly just with Yoko jiggling around, doing nothing and Kamina doing most of the work, since Simon is snivelly as well.\nBut then, when THAT happens (and those who watched this know what I am talking about), the series just gets worse. But at least Simon gets better.\nThe characters are a\n          \n        mixed bag, because there are some cool ones and then there are characters like Nia, who is basically a retard. \nThis anime is all style, no substance. It must have distracted people from its averageness by all the loud screaming and cheezy pep talk. \nBELIEVE IN ME WHO BELIEVES IN YOU WHO BELIEVES IN YOURSELF...or something like that.\n        "},

Believe in the you who believes in yourself.\" - Kamina\nTengen Toppa Gurren Laggan is a show which defies everyone's expectations in the best way possible. At first glance you think it's going to be a cheesy mech anime with an average plot. But in reality Gurren Laggan creates it's own genre and I would have to call this\n          \n        stufective (term coined by GRArkada) which is the combination of stupid and effective.\nStory: 9\nGurren Laggan is one of the only shows that really doesn't give a fuck about what you think. They let you know that in the show when they pose and a giant explosion goes on in the background. The plot itself is interesting enough, human's are hiding underground from this half-human animal hybrids which are exterminating them in Giant mechs, this seems like it actually be a pretty serious series but you realize a couple episodes in that it really doesn't expect you to take it too seriously, the show wants you to just sit-back and enjoy the ride. Gurren Laggan does a lot of things you won't expect because they are either too ridiculous or too awesome; Gurren Laggan makes even the ridiculousness good, it's like Gurren Laggan is an unknown phenomenon of goodness.\nArt: 10\nFor Tengen Toppa Gurren Laggan's time the art is actually ahead of it's time and the animation is great to look at, though disappointingly it's only in 480p on CrunchyRoll but that doesn't make this series any less deserving of your undivided attention. All the character's have a very unique design, after all these people also created Kill la Kill. Sometimes the animation switches medium all together to make scenes more entertaining and badass then if they were simply just animated.\nSound: 10\nThis is one series where you can watch either the sub or dub because each are absolutely amazing, I must applaud the voice actors of this series because you can really feel the emotion in the characters coming to life. Another highpoint of this show is the amazing soundtrack, Row Row Fight the Power will never fail to get your blood boiling as it sets the pace for the entire \"Do the impossible, see the invisible. Row Row, fight the power!\" If I do have to give a personal preference for me on this anime I would say the subbed version because I tend to just like the Japanese language in anime overall.\nCharacters: 11/10\nDefinitely the strongest point this series has to offer is it's characters. Gurren Laggan has three lead characters all of which are perfect imperfections in their own ways. Kamina is the leader of Team Dai-Gurren and to put it lightly he is a badass and will motivate even the viewer with the cheesiest lines that he some how pulls off; I don't believe I'm exaggerating how awesome he is as a character probably because he made it onto my top ten favorite characters list, I'm a fanboy for Kamina. Than you've got Simon the younger brother of Kamina who by the end of the series you see how much he's matured as a character, you can't really categorize his personality because he isn't a static character he is changing throughout the show being molded by the events and the people around him. Last and definitely least is Yoko, she has huge boobs and a very large sniper rifle. She is the eye candy of the series and is usually wearing a bikini top. There is a very large list of side characters who are pretty interesting like Viral the beastman and Kittan who is also a badass but annoying at times.\nEnjoyment: 10\nYou'll definitely enjoy this series and if you don't then you must not enjoy life very much. Even the least interesting parts of this series are enjoyable,   I've never seen a series so stupid do everything so right. The fight scenes do get a little repetitive, but they still got me hyped up for some reason.\nI don't always watch stupid anime, but when I do it's Tengen Toppa Gurren Laggan.\n\"Your drill is the drill that will pierce the Heavens!\" - Kamina\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    \"Do the impossible, see the invisible, row! row! fight the power!\" OH MY \nGOD GET OUT OF MY HEAD!!!\n[LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD]\nAside  from that bit, Gurren Lagann is an spectacle to behold and \nsomething I really wish I watched sooner. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is \na fantastic entry in the mecha genre that arguably has some of the most \nentertainment value in any anime to date. Whether that be inspiring \nspeeches from the characters to the over the top action scenes that reach \nludicrous levels of insanity. Overall, Gurren Lagann is an enjoyable ride \nthrough and through.\nStory: 8\nAs many people will tell you, Gurren Lagann\n          \n        is one of the anime that you \nshould \"Turn your brain off\" to enjoy it the most. I will not deny that \nstatement, and the story is the one to blame for that.\nGurren Lagann starts off in a setting in which the human race has hidden \nunderground from their beastmen oppressors and their mecha gunmen \nfor longer than anyone can remember, the surface world long forgotten \nand people who wish to go there are labeled as \"Suicidal\". One day, our \nmain protagonist Simon was doing his normal duties and digging \nunderground, but he stumbled upon something strange that not even his \ndrill could pierce. This was later revealed to be a mecha that Simon, \nKamina, and their friends used to defeat a beastman, now with a fire in \ntheir hearts they set off to reclaim the surface world for humanity.\nThe story starts out literally from the ground up, and overtime grows into \na show in which just it's size and scale alone completely crushes most \nother anime in that respect. If your mecha's ultimate form's little toe is the \nsize of the whole milky way, you've gone a little overboard. But it's the \nstuff that the show spouts at you that makes it so you can't take it too \nseriously, from your emotions powering your mecha to something called \n\"Anti Spirals\". There is not much literary credit to be had with Gurren \nLagann, but that's okay because that's not the reason why you watch this \nshow in the first place.\nArt & Animation: 9\nThe art and animation is one, if not the highest selling points of this show, \nas this is the main reason why Gurren Lagann is balls to wall awesome. \nThe animation directing was done by almost 20 people switching \ndirectors for each episode, this gave the art style and animation variety, \nwhether this is a good or a bad thing is still up for debate. \nHowever since it's been about 10 minutes since you've last heard this, I shall natter on about episode 4. Gainax brought Osamu Kobayashi to animate episode 4, who's past works include Beck, Paradise Kiss, and Sweat Punch. He has his own animation style that works for other series', just not Gurren Lagann. \nComparing the animation quality in episode 4 to the rest of the series is \nlike comparing Fate/Zero to Fate/Stay Night. Sure they're the same, but \none is amazing and one is kinda shit in comparison.\nBut other than the atrocious animation of episode 4, the animation for \nGurren Lagann is amazing and over the top, they have an art style that's a \nlot different than recent anime entries and it combines really well with \nthe over the top nature of this show.\nSound: 9\nThe music direction was done by Iwasaki Taku, who's list of works I don't want to get into because of how large it is, but he has a tendency to make these scores that just grab you by the balls and yank them a little bit. Gurren Lagann is no exception to this as the tracks in this series are plentiful and amazing, whether that be Sorairo Days setting the scale of the series or Row Row Fight the Power playing towards the end to make the scenes even more epic, Gurren Lagann delivers on all fronts in this regard.\nCharacters: 8\nAnother big factor in why this show is amazing is the characters \nthemselves, because you know you're doing something right when a \ncharacter who died early in the series is still the fan favorite character by \nfar. \nLets start off with our main character, Simon. Simon is shown in the \nbegining of the series to be a fairly cliche protagonist that's weak gets scared and anxious easily. However unlike most protagonists who stay like that the whole series, ala Shinji Ikari, Simon's personality does a 180 flip during the course of the show. From being scared and hiding behind people's backs to being the man who leads the charge and isn't afraid of anything.\nThe main reason for this flip is our second character, Kamina. Kamina is one of the manliest beings you will find this side of Dragonball and is the one who inspires Simon and everyone around him to fight the beastmen and take back their freedom. He has unlimited amounts of charisma and has the balls to stand up to a gunmen alone with only a sword in hand. He is also the one responsible for creating Team Gurren consisting of their friends and a rag tag team of individuals who all want their freedom back from the beastmen. However early in the series in one of their battles he is unfortuneatley killed, but with his death, rather than the team disbanding over the loss, they are instead inspired by his death and causes Simon's character the way it did. \nI shall save mention for the rest of the cast besides one person, Yoko Littner, or Yoko Titflop if you prefer. Yoko is one of the characters that people dubbed \"The Fanservice Character\" when they first saw her, and I can't really argue with that. But even Yoko's character develops greatly over time, sure she's still a pair of tits on the screen, but it's not the same pair of tits you started out with.\nEnjoyment: 10\nGurren Lagann is a brilliant piece of entertainment that you can turn your brain and enjoy it.\nOverall: 9\nGurren Lagann stands as one of the most entertaining series I've seen to date, while it doesn't have a deep story or a narrative that will keep your ears glued to your speakers, it has over the top action, a ridiculous amount of size and scale, and complete insanity.\nDid you find this review helpful? If you didn't leave some feedback as to why so I can use your advice in my next review ^.^\nRating System:\n((Story) + (Characters x2) + (Art x3) + (Sound) + (Enjoyment x3)) / 10\n        "},

(6)\nSPOILER: The hero always win, most of the time in half of an episode each, there is no hard time shown, no loss, wtf if the best loses sometimes, this makes the anime so childish, so naruto, actually worse than naruto since he actually loses to ppl. \nin conclusion ths story is very overated, definately not the best\n          \n        story I seen, even vandread tops the anime's story \nART: ok, not so good, but no so bad either, its pretty good but it feels so 20th century, the graphics definately cant match those of FMP or Gundam. good try though.(8) \nSound: good, really good sound, but most animes have at least ok sound, no suripse here (9) \nCHARACTER: good characters, only thing good about this anime, the character is very deep and is very interesting unlike some animes, the character is plain and simple, but the only thing is the hero is like naruto with more luck and bs talent. that ruin the perfect score, but the other characters are definately more interesting than at least half of the anime i seen. \nEnjoyment: no, not too good, when i watched this i skiped parts to make it god faster. only anime that i do that in is the ones i seen or the ones that i think is boring and childish.. definately not good as other mecha animes, such as vandread, FMP, gundam, even neon eval. is better and thats like 10 years old... \noverall: mmhm ok not so good, seen better, seen worse, give it like 70%, it still watchable.. \n        "},

Mankind's history is full of it. Humans trying to gain power from other humans. But what if humans weren't the main power on Earth? What would you do? Would you stay underground and accept your fate or would you fight it and try to rise up? Would you believe in yourself and believe in the people what believe n you? That is the story of the MS (Mecha Suit) anime \"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\" or Gurren Lagann for short.\nStory: 9/10\nThe story is a story of a Man's fate as he shapes his own destiny.\n          \n        Living underground their whole life's, Simon and his older blood-brother Kamina set out to the surface world above ground with their companion Yoko. Along the way they build a team known as Team Gurren and using machines known as Gunmen fight for humanity's freedom against The Beastmen and their leader the Spiral King.\nCharacters: 10/10\nThe show has a wide range of characters ranging from young to old, strong to weak, and brave to scared. Simon, a fourteen year old boy is the wielder of a powerful Gunmen known as Gurren. He is very timid and often runs from a fight. Unlike his heroic, brave, and somewhat dense blood-brother Kamina. Kamina is a \"Man among Man\" and is the leader of Team Gurren. Along with the smart sureshot Yoko, they make a team with many humans and fight for what they all believe in. A Better Tomorrow.\nSetting: 7/10\nThe setting is on Earth. Because the Beastmen are in control, the humans are all forced to live in underground villages while the Beastmen thrive above ground. Now the surface is very barren. It has all become a world of nothing. The only cities that remain are Beastmen cities. The setting gets a eight because the cities are usually powerful Gunmen that Team Gurren must face. Besides that, there isn't really much to look at. Just the same land over and over again.\nMusic: 9/10\nThe opening song titled: \"Sorairo Days\" by Shoko Nakagawa is the only opening theme used for all twenty-seven episodes. But halfway in the series they use the second verse of the song instead of the first verse as they did in the first half. There are also three ending themes used.\"Underground\" by High Voltage. \"Happily Ever After\" by Shoko Nakagawa, and \"Minna no Peace\" by Afromania. During the show, the music and themes as well as the OST are amazing and fit what is happening the show.\nFinal Statement:\nThis anime has a reasonable length of Twenty-Seven Epiosdes. It is a mecha anime so if you don't like animes such as Gundem they I would advise you to stay away from it. But with it's action, romance, surprise twists, and interesting colorful characters, it is an anime worth watch even if you aren't into Mecha. Below is the trailer of the English Dub. Enjoy and hope you all give this amazing anime a chance.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVb8nKj6iYo"},

It's art style looked pretty simple but modern, ( in some cases, the show purposely showed etches on the character, but that's to make it look all gangster-y and hip-hop-ish) but their simplicity really suited the anime.\nSound: Again, the music was simple, but modern. And again, unlike most anime I've watched, TTGL maked use of BOTH stanzas of the same opening song. The overall music is hip, modern, and with pretty cool beats I can appreciate. Also the occasional rock music to increase the tension, and the slow opera, to release tension and just makes you cry.\nAs for their sounds...get ready for repetitive screaming from the characters and explosions.\nCharacters: AWESOME. The characters were the best! Simon: once timid boy to self-confident man, Kamina: most outrageous, but most amazing, Yoko: smexy as hell ( a must for the male audience XD), Leeron: just...funny XD.  If you're looking for a hot dude to go fan-girl on (i.e. shoujo animes like Special A (Kei! XD)), Gurren Laggan is not for you, but if you're looking for explosive characters to idolize, Gurren Lagann is a must!\nEnjoyment: all TTGL episodes were just like consecutive mounds of volcanoes ready to erupt, and when you pass right through it..KABOOM! action! adventure! romance! drama! and comedy! (all but one compilation episode at least, but you have 26 episodes of hardcore action, give yourself a rest XD). If in the language of books you have a \"page-turner\", in the language of animes you have a \"play the next episode!\". And TTGL is definitely a \"play the next episode!\". It took me a lot of will-power just to turn off my laptop and save he rest for another time XD. \nOverall: TTGL is a must-watch for everyone! Don't be a loser and stay behind, join the Gurren Brigade now!\n(p.s. This is my first review. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann was just so good I HAD to review about it)\n        "},

Enjoyment- the entire experience is just enjoyable and 2. MANLINESS- The manliest anime there is(in a good way).\nSo why is it great?  Well here are the many plusses.\n+The art is original and very colorful.  It starts out great and only gets better from there.\n+There is loads of action in every episode, and no fillers or wasted time.\n+It is very optimistic and uplifting, a very refreshing break from the many other thought-provoking, dramatic, and sometimes even downright depressing shows.\n+Its impossible not to\n          \n        feel for the main character, even when the show doesn't spend 10+episodes on his past.  The events that shape his life happen DURING the anime, so it removes the need for needless flashbacks.\n+It has an over-the-top and in-your-face attitude that just makes you want to scream HELL YEAH!!! about 4+ times every episode.  Your testosterone levels will skyrocket when you watch it.\n+Very quotable.  You'll understand when you see it, I don't want to spoil it for you.\n+Has a great ending, you won't feel shortchanged(this is very important for me).\n+Yoko is a babe.  They even say so.\nThe negatives-\n-The battles aren't complex or tactical like lets say Code Geass(which I also liked).  They are mostly focused on the manliness and courage and \"fighting spirit.\"  Most of the battles play out the same way(btw it didn't bother me that much, but I'm mentioning it because it might bother others)\n-It isn't very realistic.  Let me expand this.  They don't spend the time to explain \"why\" lots of things happen besides AAAAAAARRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!  If they tried to explain why everything happens and make it look \"realistic\", then we'd be watching a tv reality show!  It keeps the pace fast, but again, some people might be turned off by it.\nConclusion...\nI sincerely believe that this anime epitomizes the word shounen.  If you like action animes, then stop thinking about it and just do it.  You won't regret it.\n        "},

I find it interesting that this particular bit of dialogue I’ve quoted goes relatively unnoticed, as I think it sums up the show rather well. Taking hold of the sun and harnessing it may sound glorious, but the undertaking carries a hefty price. TTGL (the show) reminds me of the Greek myth of Icarus; the boy who flew too close to the\n          \n        sun on wings of wax that melted, and plunged him into the sea. This show also reaches for greatness, and inevitably, it experiences it’s own fall.   \nThis is not to say that it’s a bad show. It isn’t bad at all, in fact, it is usually entertaining; and doesn’t lack a certain flair that instantly separates it from anything else. Style is where this anime really shines through, and in that respect, it has few peers. The fast-paced storytelling and over-the-top action of the first episode gives you an idea of how the show will play out. There will be surprises along the way, but in the end, the story never really does evolve too far beyond that simple premise of mecha, guns, explosions, and action. Characters do develop over time, and this growth is usually logical; but will always lead back to more fighting with bigger and better weapons. It’s a simple formula, and in this case I would say that it was successfully executed.   \nContrasting with the static setting is the primary theme: the evolution and the inevitability of human growth. And all the prices that come with it. It presents us with a detailed picture of our own expansionary tendencies, and instead of condemning them, makes a rather profound argument in their defense. Serving as a symbol for our ability to grow and evolve, the drill and spiral are both commonly seen throughout the story. The spiral: twisting ever upward and outward, always circling back around it’s point of origin, repeating itself evermore on ever-grander stages. The drill: a single point that pierces whatever boundary it meets, and a spiral behind the point that pushes open an ever-widening path through those boundaries. The ideas of historical repetition, destiny, inevitability, and choice are all explored through the interactions of the characters and the events that they partake in. And this is all reflected in the repeated use of larger and more extravagant drills and spirals. \nWhile this theme is complex, and the argument presented is thoughtful; there is some problems in the execution. Stories need good, clear themes to be good stories, but they also need good direction, pacing, and dialogue. Symbolism and ideation are necessary, but not enough. The first act felt rushed, and left some key story-elements unexplained. More problematic was that it gave the following act a brooding sense of finality. One is left wondering, to some degree, if the show should not have simply ended there. I believe, with some simple tweaking, that it could have ended there, and might have actually made for a better show. But alas, I am not the creator, and that was not their choice. \nThere is a third act, and it is that part of the story that felt the most out of place, and unlike the first act, was far too long. In some senses, we feel that characters have grown too quickly; but in others we feel that they haven’t grown at all. Consequently, the static setting is no longer ironic, but in some ways: dull. The repetition of action and even of dialogue, while appropriate in some instances, was eventually reduced to a string of bland nods at revelations long since achieved, and problems long since resolved. The emotional weight of the first act and second acts drags at the third act, and results in a kind of hollowness in the events and characters. \nHowever, for all its flaws, the finale is appropriate; and the epilogue does, to some degree, wrap up the show in a pretty decent and conclusive way. Thankfully the show retains its style and flair throughout the end; but both are notably extinguished when compared to the grandeur and promise of the first and second acts. Whatever failures the final act does have, I don’t think that they outweigh the successes of the beginning and middle. I would recommend the series to pretty much everyone, but would also leave him or her with a word of warning. You will probably like the show, and you might love it, but you also might be disappointed by the last eight or nine episodes. \nOverall, it’s a very interesting show that I’m glad I watched. I like it more as time passes, but I also wonder if that’s because I’ve forgotten about the worse parts and remembered the best parts. Maybe someday I’ll give it a rewatch and see how I feel. For now, I feel comfortable in saying this about it: \nGreat Idea + Average Execution = Good Show\n{{ Specific Ratings:\nStory: 7/10\nArt: 9/10\nSound: 8/10\nCharacter: 7/10\nEnjoyment: 7/10 \nOverall: 7/10 }}\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    Note: this is after a first viewing and I might change my opinion after a second viewing as it happened for Kill la Kill. Consider this review temporary.\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann has been consistently compared with Kill la Kill ever since I can remember hearing about the latter. Usually in TTGL's favour.\nNow having gone the wrong way in and watched KLK first, I expected different things than what others did, and I must say that no, I do not find TTGL to shine as much as I was told. It may just be my complete disinterest in mechas, but mechas are a tool to tell\n          \n        a story as, and they aren't the only point in this anime. This is more about the characters and story.\nArt: It's ok, I guess. Except for Yoko's bounciful bouncyness of boobage nothing really struck me stylistically. Again, coming from Kill la Kill which is an onslaught of visual style and design madness and creativity, TTGL looks less flamboyant, less fantastic, less everything in comparison. Yoko's as sexy an anime girl as it gets, I remember Nia and Kamina as looking pretty good, and my opinion on the mechas is nonexistent. It's a solid 7 but I really have nothing all that fantastic to say about it. Even the main visual and philosophical metaphor of the series, the Spiral, I don't think is all that brillant. It's good, it works, it is competent, moving on.\nSound: Again, KLK first, have to compare the crappy rap opera that's supposedly the best song from TTGL with the great soundtrack from KLK. Or even with other animes honestly. I can like a lot of little things, I love the openings and endings from cheap shows like Dagashi Kashi or Himouto Umaru-chan and I just can't remember a really strong song from any part of TTGL. No, that Row Row Fight the Power didn't stick, it just made me wanna listen to something else. Voice acting in all versions that I saw(japanese, english and french) is brillant and deserves a great note, and general sound design is fine, but I really can't imagine ever trying to look out for the whole OST of TTGL and listening to it. 6.\nEnjoyment: It was okay, good most of the time, but some things just confused me, especially with story design. 7.\nCharacters: This is where I'm gonna take some time explaining my issues with TTGL.\nBecause beyond the comparison with KLK and the fact that KLK was literally no substance and all for style, I find TTGL to be a bit...odd. TTGL isn't, like I expected, a style over substance, it has style and substance. So that's an obvious plus, correct? Well yes and no. To be honest after watching TTGL I understood why the makers of it would do KLK as a no-substance show: because's that's clearly their greatest talent. TTGL has some great stories and core ideas, it has solid characters and in general it's a monomyth story done with gusto and style. It would be a truly great anime if not for several problems with the general design.\nLet's talk characters and pick out 5 for a bit: Kamina, Nia, Yoko, Roshiu and obviously Simon.\nEach of them has his own part in Simon's story. Kamina has the timeless \"if you can't believe in yourself, believe in me, who believes in you\", he acts as the motor of Simon's natural abilities. He serves a purpose in Simon's life by teaching him courage and confidence by example.\nYoko's part in Simon's life is to teach him love and sexual attraction. She's nice to everyone, including him, and also ridiculously attractive. She falls for Kamina(which could have been better portrayed but w/e) and she teaches Simon (and the audience) the pains of teenage love and rejection, in an interestingly intricate situation, too.\nNia's part in Simon's life is to teach him a more mature love, based on common values and life goals. It's a more adult love about commitment and understanding rather than boob wiggling.\nRoshiu's part in part 2 of the anime is to show Simon his own weakness in constantly trying to solve everything with his strength and the strength of Gurren Lagann instead of cutting corners and doing the harsh, difficult decisions that might end up sacrificing a lot of people for the sake of survival of the most. Sort of a political motto, \"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of all\".\nNow with that list compiled, I want you to try and think about which part of these characters actually had an arc that properly ended except for Kamina's.\nKamina's arc ends in the most endy of all endings. So that's settled. But what about the others?\nNia's personality is heavily overcome, so she can count as dead/gone for most of the anime.\nBut what about Yoko and Roshiu?\nYoko gets horribly lovescarred, that's fine, but what comes after? Does she ever go on to have another love story? Does she ever move on from her emotional state? She does get over the pain, a little too quickly if you ask me, but that's not the point I'm trying the make. \nThe point I'm trying to make is that once her love triangle with Simon and Kamina is gone, there is literally nothing going on with her as a character. She keeps shooting some more things and disappears for most of part 2, and when she comes back she shoots some more and gets kissed by Kittan and then it's the end. She does get that whole Yoko episode where you see what she's become, but I only saw that episode as being an open admission that she was completely stuck as a character and they didn't want to write anything else for her. What makes a coming of age story or a conquest story really good is what the characters discover, and what changes about them during the process of growth and discovery. And the thing that by far made me scratch my head the most during TTGL was the fact that once the characters had ended their direct relationship with Simon, either through death or because Simon's arc with them was done, they were basically put aside and never evolved again. Yoko loves Kamina, Simon loves Yoko. Kamina dies and Yoko, whose love triangle is over and who never gets into a romance with Simon, basically never evolves again until the end of the story. Her teaching bout is just about as distant from evolution as it gets, it's like she's 20-something and yet has already decided on her entire life course and  will never change again.\nThe same applies to all the other side characters. Breaking down the entire story arcs, I always come to the conclusion that the characters bring something to Simon, and once that's done and they cannot directly influence Simon, they just leave the spotlight, making a very large cast entirely Simon-centric.\nStory - And this is where we talk about the story. A lot of it is character driven and since characters and their evolution always revolve around Simon, it's basically a long Simon monomyth of how the wimpy talented brat became the hero. In part 1, you start in the underground and end up defeating the Spiral King. It's almost a videogame story, go from dungeon to dungeon and fight whatever's there, usually with Kamina as the knight/hero/loudmouth, Yoko as the support/helper/white mage and Simon as the talent/problem solver/black mage. It's simple and works, even if it is blatantly obvious to me that the makers are better at giving a brimming style than at telling a multithreaded story with lots of character arcs at the same time. \nPart 2 is about understanding what the Spiral King was  and why, and then about fighting the fight he had been fighting all along, with him transformed as a galactic tourist guide to boot.\nOf Part 1 I have the general sentiment that they are trying to tell a lot of little things but again, it ends without really ending, characters just stop being useful to Simon or Kamina and then they just sort of get dropped. It's still mostly fine.\nBut of Part 2 I have a lot more to say, and now it's time to talk about Roshiu as an adult.\nRoshiu in part 2 gets to a point where he essentially understands the dangers that all of mankind is facing and is trying extremely hard to deal with it in the only way that he sees fit. By itself, his decisions are rational, make sense, and are very difficult to make. Roshiu's tale in part 2 is the tale of one who has to become Caesar, he has to become the dictator and to do so has to cross every Rubicon in his way, including letting hundreds of thousands die and reject all his friends and former fellow fighters. His tale should have been extremely interesting because he is the voice of Reason and Logic at every step: do what is sensible and coldly necessary and ignore all your feelings and morality, painful as it may be.\nThe problem is, exactly like with Yoko's part in the story in part 1, all of Roshiu's actions end up not being of any use to Simon's personal story anymore. It boils down to all his cold decisions being pointless because Simon just pulls Gurren Lagann and destroys all opposition with brute force, like he intended to.\nThis part honestly baffles me because it means that:\n-We follow Roshiu's painful decisions for over 5 episodes to a point that's absolutely nil\n-Cold, hard and difficult choices are made, only to be literally annihilated by anime rules\n-Why would  you spend so much time making a character's story arc so deep and then undo it all with a simple \"just make a bigger mech and rekk them all\"\nVery much like Yoko's part, Kamina's part or any other character's, I feel like Roshiu's part ended at the precise moment where Simon didn't need him anymore. Simon needed Yoko to know love and its pains, Kamina for confidence, and in Roshiu he needed to face Reason and the pains of doing what's necessary. Except it WAS NEVER necessary, since he could just pull a new mech out of his butt and instantly defeat the adversity! If you look at the facts, Roshiu's arc could have entirely been him sitting at his desk sipping tea telling everyone \"it's all gonna be fine, don't worry\" and let Simon talk with his mecha fists and the result would have been almost EXACTLY the same.\nAnd that's by far my biggest problem with Gurren Lagann. I get the sense that for a large and wide mythological story done with mechs, with heroes, fallen ones, kings and gods(the antispirals are definitely godly), love and its pains, for something so grand in scale and so powerful in its themes, almost everything it does is sacrificed on the altar of Simonmaking. Make Simon confident, make Simon sad, make Simon great, make Simon the Hero...\nIt feels like 50 threads were given to me and whenever the threads were split from the main \"Simon's story\" thread, they were just cut off. How do I feel about Yoko never growing out into a new relationship or story after Kamina? How do I feel about watching Roshiu try and take all the world's weight on his shoulders for a lot of episodes then just get it all undone because Gurren Lagann is there to save him? I feel wanting, and incomplete. I wanted to see Yoko end up somewhere nice, not go live like the love of her life was gone and nobody else ever came up so she'd just live taking care of kids instead. I wanted to see Roshiu's actions get given results, painful as those might've been. I wanted to not see Simon smiling it off once Nia's story ends and going \"ah, we were expecting it anyway\"!\nIn general TTGL comes off as daring and as a modernization of an almost greek-mythology epic, which I absolutely love, but I can't help but feel extremely wanting. I wanted endings for all those side characters, I wanted all the things that were launched to end properly, I wanted to see something else than to see Simon and Yoko living to old age without any real changes or growths to the characters they were when they fought with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann at the end!\nAnd I got none of it. I'm not disapointed, but I just feel like it fell short of its potential in too many ways to not feel itchy at all the parts that should've been properly done if this was indeed a large mythical epic and not just Simon's mythical epic.\nOverall: As I said in the beginning, watching KLK and then TTGL made me understand why KLK is so shallow. Because that is by far, in TTGL and in KLK, the greatest suit for their makers. TTGL may give me a lot of threads that get cut, and it may have lots of parts that have left me wanting, but the over-the-top style and love of exaggeration and going beyond the credible is something that is a complete success in both, and is easily the most faultless part of TTGL. The mech growth in size and levels of craziness especially in part 2 are a testament to that.\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann may have let me down in quite a few ways, but it is still daring and tries a lot, even if it's too Simon-centric. It has qualities in spades, I just wish that it had properly taken care of all its interesting and attractive side characters.\n        "},

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (or TTGL) was something that just blows you off and hopefully will make you all remember of this great anime.\nStory: 9\nUnexpected. Although I watched Kill la Kill, this was a different type of outrageous anime. The story just leaves you with a [b]BANG[/b] and it's really hard to describe the depth of this story. Mainly, it is divided into two parts where you can watch them as a standalone if you prefer. Trying to make this\n          \n        an no-spoiler review is really hard, but I can tell you that you will be riding the roller coaster in this story and you won't take your seat belt off. It is just too breathtaking. No confusing order in the plot, no plot holes (maybe there is if you question life too much), and most of all no cliffhangers for the ending. I assure you, TTGL is worthy to watch partly because of the story.\nArt: 8\nMaybe I should have rated it higher, considering it was a 2007 anime, but still, gotta be critical. Good design for the characters though, they look lovely, and no bizarre outfits or so. The animation is quite thrilling, with over-the-top qualities, and fast-paced movements. The slight problem for this anime is the fight scenes. Although they were greatly made, it wasn't as smooth as I expected and the picture becomes kinda blurry or so. Overall, for the animation, it gave spectacular sightings in the anime.\nSound: 9\nAll the soundtracks and every bits of music played in this anime were timed really well, and fit perfectly. The OP, the OST, and everything just fits so well. They add drama and revs up our perspective on how motivational this anime is. Especially the soundtrack during dramatic moments, (Row Row Fight the Power!) that's the one thing that kept me going. Although I got demotivated during some times in the anime, the moment that lady starts singing that opera part, you will lift your head up. Yup, the sound plays a great role into making this one of the best anime so far.\nCharacter: 10\nDo I need to explain? A long ass description of each character won't help. Kamina, yes, my nigga Kamina and his one-liners, that's what makes the 1st part of the anime so meaningful. A RL Kamina would do this world the greater good, but in the anime, TTGL will be nothing without him. Other characters that are influenced by him, such as Simon, Yoko, Kittan and others, he's the sole support of the character development in this series. Same as what Yoko said [quote]If Simon is pulling us from above, you are pushing us from below[/quote]. The characters, yep this is what makes TTGL worthwhile.\nEnjoyment: 9\nNever have I ever been so deeply moved in my dull life. Ever feeling down? Watch it now.\nOverall: 9\nLong story short, although quite over-the-top, TTGL is the man when you need to know the meaning of life.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    There is a lot I want to talk about with this anime but fortunately for you I can’t in a review like this. I'll give you a general version for those who just want to know briefly what kind of experience the show is, and for those of you who are interested in my rambling are invited to read the whole thing.\nGENERAL VERSION (spoiler free if you haven't watched and are considering watching)\nStory 10/10\nThe plot was amazing.\nThe mechas I watched growing up were all Gundam so I was expecting something war themed like Gundam or Code Geass. This was not what I expected for a\n          \n        mecha. Most mechas I've seen were about war and how meaningless it is and how killing each other is necessary / not necessary to achieve peace bla bla bla main character doesn’t kill bla bla bla etc.\nThis was not about your typical stupidly pacifistic protagonist realizes he needs to fight to protect something. \nThis is the story of a man who rose up to his fate, didn’t like it and so he drilled a hole through it.\nI saw a lot of detail put into the plot of the anime. There were a lot of little speeches and interesting details that I found very thought-provoking, and it made me sad to see reviews criticizing Gurren Lagann as being mindless action. It was not mindless action, and if you’re interested in why I say that I encourage you to read the “epilogue” found after the general section of this review.\nThe style of the mechas and fighting are what I would describe as \"hip-hopping, falcon punching robots in outer space\", so if you're looking for laser blasting magnificent engineering masterpieces (Gundam, Code Geass) or gritty full metal gunslingers like other mechas you've seen before, you will be disappointed.\nArt 10/10\nI found the art style to be really cool. My favourites were the little outros and intros for supposed commercial breaks, which were graffiti style murals presented with a short hip hop beat. \nThe mecha and machine style of Gurren Lagann may seem odd to people who are used to other mecha anime’s but I actually liked how they followed through with it. All the technology had a recurring theme of giant faces from the battleships to the gunmen to the buildings. I haven’t decided on my opinion on why they did this yet but because of the amount of detail put into the plot I don’t think it’s simply an art style. \nMost of the time I'm not a fan of fighting in anime. My only exception is if the animation quality is high like it is in something like Fate/ Stay night or Avatar. That being said, Gurren Lagann's fighting was awesome. It wasn't a high frame rate or flashy special effects that attracted me but rather the fighting style and straight up absurdity that made it interesting. It was creative and really original from my perspective, and watching the gunmen fight was blood-boiling and made me want to get up and fight too.\nSound 10/10\nThe opening theme and closing themes for both arcs were pretty amazing. I was really impressed with the transition between story arcs, which used the same opening music but had different animations. I'm not usually a fan of rock but I was pretty impressed and hooked by the ending theme of both arcs so I found myself watching it throughout my marathon.\nThe entire anime featured a hip hop beat with the lyrics \"fight the power\" which was really appropriate to the themes. I really like hip hop so if you’re like me you will appreciate the background music.\nCharacter 8/10\nThere were a lot of characters in this anime; so many that I honestly didn't know a lot of them. A lot of the characters were just filler characters which is what lost points with me. I was going to write about this really generally but after reading some of the other reviews I'll go through a couple key characters so you can have a good comparison.\nKamina:\nThe Legend. To me Kamina was a pretty awesome character. You can read a bit more about him in my \"epilogue\". For now I'll say that he is a really charismatic character that is able to lead people by giving them hope, which is pretty powerful in humanity's time of despair. He fights recklessly and he'll come up with the most ridiculous plans and the best part is they work. A great leader in the time of despair.\nYoko:\nThe Sniper. Yoko was a bit of a let down for me. I appreciate the extra time that the animators dedicated on her boobs, but apart from that she sort of fell off with development. Yoko’s role in the story diverges from the main plot which involves Simon and the universe, so watching her significance fade deeper and deeper into the background was kind of disappointing.\nSimon:\nThe Digger. Simon was constantly under the spotlight, and I really liked how he was developed. He’s the trooper that you can always rely on, but he only does one thing: dig with his drill. The way that the writers used this theme of Simon’s drill was pretty creative so when you’re watching just remember that “you can always count on Simon’s drill.”\nRossiu:\nRossiu took an unexpectedly interesting turn in the later episodes. I thought he would be a minor character but he was soon given the spotlight as an important figure. He’s the kind of person who makes all the right choices when faced with difficult decisions, but ultimately his fate isn’t a path of glory. He's a pretty realistic person during a time of peace (by peace I mean not war).\nViral:\nThe Warrior. He's the one that won't back down from a challenge and will refuse any method other than the most honourable one. He reminded me of Ned Stark from Game of Thrones, and his role becomes pretty interesting as the story progresses. His voice actor is also very good at screaming and such talents contributed significantly to my enjoyment.\nThere are a couple of other interesting characters that I won’t mention here because of spoilers. The majority of characters were just filler characters and unfortunately I just didn’t buy into them, and served about as much purpose to me as trees in the backdrop of a play.\nEnjoyment 10/10\nI had a great time watching Gurren Lagann. I’ve recently been on an extended anime marathon and honestly gotten kind of bored of generic anime’s, but this has been a ray of light through the clouds. The ending was satisfying and I would recommend this series to anyone, especially those who enjoy plot driven action.\nMORE IN-DEPTH REVIEW (brief discussion of things I found interesting)\nWARNING: The information I included in the following section is all information that could possibly go in a synopsis, but I can’t guarantee that it is 100% spoiler free. The best way to go about it would be to maybe watch the anime and come back to my review after establishing your own views (that's wishful thinking). Read at your own risk.\nI'll start by pointing out that the premise of the story doesn't really make much sense. Simon is a digger who digs holes to expand their underground village when Kamina suggests that they use his drill to pierce the ceiling. \nWait…..\nDrills are designed to dig tunnels downwards underground, not upwards, so already there is something that doesn't make sense with this. The backwards trend continues after they reach the surface. Throughout the entire series Simon is constantly digging upwards with his drill, starting from underground (the bottom) and ending up in the cosmos (now we’re here). \nI don't think that this is a coincidence: I believe that the writers intentionally used the symbol of the drill for Simon to take and use completely backwards. The drill was also cleverly incorporated with their symbol for evolution: the spiral. \nI won't go into the detailed features of the spiral, but I will say that its power has some interesting interactions with the concept of belief. There are a lot of details and examples about the theme of belief throughout the show, so I'll just bring up my favourite example. The following has some explicit plot content, but nothing that will ruin any plot surprises.\nThis is the story of where Kamina got his faith in Simon. Kamina and some of his followers, including Simon, were tunneling underground when they get lost. Nobody knew where their home village was or if they would ever return to it (for those of you who have played minecraft you know this feeling). In Kamina’s version of the story, everyone was about to lose hope after hours of digging when he saw Simon hunched over; Simon was the last one still digging and the last to give up. Seeing Simon’s perseverance after everyone had given up gave him the strength to cheer everyone on and restore their hope. Soon after they were able to find their way back to the village. The interesting part is that in Simon’s version of the story, Simon was the one about to give up when he was cheered on by Kamina and found the resolve to continue digging. \nSo let's think about this: Simon was going to give up until Kamina supported him, and Kamina was about to give up until Simon supported him. So who believed in who first? Where did their hope come from? The answer is nowhere. Thinking logically they made something from nothing and the story itself is a paradox. Simon dug because Kamina believed in him and Kamina believed in Simon because he dug. The two of them share this irrational belief in each other which really wouldn't have worked if they had known what the other was thinking at the moment and the result is that something was made possible out of a paradox belief system: impossible.\nThe entire series is themed around making the impossible possible by believing in something that doesn't necessarily make sense. You will see this with not only Simon, but other characters as well. The plot is really creative in that every time Simon is faced with some kind of ceiling he uses his drill to pierce it (the characters will sometimes even explicitly say “hey that looks like a ceiling”), so see if you can spot what kinds of ceilings he breaks through with his drill as you watch the anime. \nI was also very interested in the design of the Gurren Lagann (robot). \nLagann was the first to be discovered underground and one of your first impressions of it as a viewer is how small it is. The Gurren is a typical Beastman gunmen, and has the characteristic large face on its torso and no head. When they combine, Simon’s Lagann takes the position of Gurren Lagann’s head, and the face where Kamina sits is the position of where Gurren Lagann’s heart would be. Their positions in the Gurren Lagann reflect Simon and Kamina’s personalities and relationship: Kamina is the heart that burns with passion while Simon is the head that makes the heart’s desires possible. You can see this kind of relationship between the two of them in later fights as well.\nYou could say that I’m overthinking things, but these were things that naturally came to mind while I was watching. Whether or not you buy into them is up to you.\nI think that's all I'll cover for this review. I found a lot things within the anime that referred to human nature and the human spirit, but I won’t talk about it here because it may reveal some plot spoilers for you. My hope for this review was to encourage you to think critically about the content and to show you that Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is far from mindless action."},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    If you decided to watch Gurren Lagann based on what you've heard people say, a warning: lower your expectations. Gurren Lagann is not a bad anime - far from it - but neither is the masterpiece that people claim to be.\nThe story begins very slowly. The first episodes only serve to introduce characters and concepts that may / will be important in the future. There is a lot of explanation and protagonist speech in the beginning, so it takes patience.\nThe characters have the personality and speeches clichés of a shōnen, but are well developed throughout the story.\nThe animation may bother you a bit. She is\n          \n        inconsistent; at times - especially during battles - the scenes are fluid, well-designed and especially beautiful. At other times the scenes look like scribbles, as if they were made in a hurry.\nIn short, Gurren Lagann is in fact an anime that is worth taking a look. The story just gets better with time, the characters are fun and the music really makes you feel part of that world.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    Gurren Lagann is arguably one of the greatest anime series of all time, and for good reason. I just started watching it yesterday. And I got through all 27 episodes in the course of the past thirty-six hours. It was that freaking good. There are so many things that have been said about this anime that I know when I say them they will sound repetitive, but you hear these things for good reason. This is a series that as a fan of anime, I can safely say has something for everyone.\nStory\nGurren Lagann does not have the greatest story of any anime. The situations we\n          \n        see in the series are exciting and well thought out, but the story isn’t the strongest point. It starts with a post-apocalyptic sort of survival story, an uprising of humanity that is a common theme of science fiction stories, but it is done in such a spectacular way through the giant robot battles and ultra exciting war-like fights that are bigger than any fights in any anime. Part two takes us seven years in the future where we see a much more renaissance-like version of sci-fi that works fantastically with the previous arc. Without spoiling anything, something heads for Earth, we see a distinct change in humanities priorities and we encounter what is essentially God. This isn’t untold of in a Gainax anime, I knew from the start that something religious-like would happen. Not that it is in your face and quite as prevalent as that of Neon Genesis Evangelion, but it is still there if you look into it a bit.\nThe story shines in the politics of the second half and what happens there, but otherwise it is a lot more character driven than story. Though I must say that the background story is fleshed out well. But overall, I wasn’t sticking around for the story as much as the characters.\nAnimation\nSome will hate the animation style, some will love it. I personally found its’ bright colors and smooth animation to be great. It’s supposed to invoke in you a nostalgic feeling of eighties mecha anime and it does that. But it also maintains a bit of that modern feel with how vivid the colors are. The Beastmen and robots look great.\nSound\nThe sound is fantastic. The voice actors are all great for one thing and convey emotions well. The music is great, the opening music being catchy and a good start, the ending music being good as well. The music during the show helps pump you up during fight scenes and convey the mood of the characters during sadder scenes. The explosions are fantastic sounding and I can’t find a single problem with the sound.\nCharacters\nYou keep watching this series quite simply for the vast array of well thought out and typically well fleshed out characters. Every character is distinct in their actions, voice, and mindset and as the series progresses each one is pushed to the limit and also show their true colors. Even the bad guys are fleshed out well. Each character reflects humanity in a different respect. It’s just hard to describe the characters without giving away a spoiler or going through each character and who they are. I did not dislike a single character. Of course, throughout they become bitchy or whiny, but they act like humans would act. If Gainax got one thing right with this series, it was characters. I’m going out on a limb, but I’m going to say it:\nGurren Lagann has the best cast of characters ever.\nI went and did it. Take your teenage angst ridden robot riders elsewhere. While some of the characters do act like wusses at points, it’s because seriously terrible things have happened. People actually die in this series and it hurts the person watching, as well as severely affects the characters. This series gets characters right and everyone will find a favorite.\nOverall\nI’m going to say something about reviewing anime real quick. It’s tough to rate different anime on a 1-10 scale because there are all different kinds of anime. I rate this close to Ghost in the Shell but that’s not to say this will be better liked than Ghost in the Shell because these anime cater to two different crowds, have two different styles. It’s hard for me to convey in reviews how much somebody else may like an anime because everyone has different things they like. I love my adult techno-thriller and hardcore sci fi kind of anime. But this is not exactly for those kind of people.\nYou see what I’m saying? It’s hard to review Fruits Basket on the same scale as Gurren Lagann because they cater to two different audiences. It’s the loophole of being a critic. You rate on the scale that the complete opposite is reviewed on.\nAnyway, regardless of what you like, there is something to like in this. There’s romance, mechs, action, some deeper psychological thinking, hard science fiction, fantasy elements. It mixes all of these with great characters, fantastic dialogue, amazing action scenes, a great animation style, and it wraps up in a satisfying (though sad) conclusion that doesn’t leave any plot threads open for you to have to think over.\nGurren Lagann is now one of my favorite anime. I can never pick a number one favorite anime because I like stuff catering to different audiences and it’s hard to choose one over the other because of how different they are. But this is most definitely one of the best anime I’ve ever seen.\nWell met Gurren Lagann. I’m sure I’ll be coming back for a reacquaintance sometime soon.\n        "},

Want an awesome mecha? Let's make it even better by fusioning it!\nWant an awesome attack? Let's find another that is way more cool.\nFighting an enemy? More like fighting the impossible!\nMaybe i see this anime too subjectively, but to be quite frank, It is one of the most badass anime you can find ever around. Sure, maybe its drawing is a bit old (especially for an\n          \n        episode, where the art is very different than the rest of the show) and the story that is very straight, without too many plot twists. But what i will call its lack of refinement, is what makes it awesome. You don't need to think. You don't need to see logic. You don't need to analyze the characters. They are what they are, and the show is what the show is. \nIf you love seinen and psychological or sad animes, pass your way. You won't find something interesting in it. But if you love shônen, and love simple things that get awesome, you'll find one of the most interesting anime. \n(Also you'll repeat over and over the characters lines, as they stick with you wherever you go. It's just that awesome.)\n        "},

Gurren Lagann ranks among those shows. Much like those shows it shares a very well written story, a theme about the enduring spirit of humanity against the odds and an incredible ending. \nHowever, this is a Gurren Lagann review, so now we shall focus on the 6 main tenets that MAL categorises its shows in:\nSTORY:\nThe guidelines say to not write a synopsis, so I won't, but what I will say is that few shows can keep the levels of insanity rising like Gurren Lagann does and still stay to the same standards. Every veil that is lifted has another behind it, and another behind it. It is only by watching to the end that you will see the truth, the true glory of this show, 10/10.\nART:\nThe animation is incredible, the transformation scenes are utterly insane, the characters emotions reflected perfectly through the art and later on some of the art becomes almost too good for its time, 10/10.\nSOUND:\nFor a show with a lot of screaming, it (unlike Black Clover) remains very tolerable. The voice actors do an incredible job and the music complements the general uplifting feel of the show very well, 10/10.\nCHARACTER:\nIncredible, 10/10.\nENJOYMENT:\nBlu-ray disks of this show could be given as anti-depressants. Moving ever onwards, in spite of any adversity that may come your way, staying strong and pushing forwards forever more, what a message, and what good feeling, 10/10.\nOVERALL:\nOnly Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood has ever gotten me angry in the same way. Angry that MAL doesn't have an 11/10 or something. This show is a masterpiece. Go watch it. \n(P.S. If I did have one problem with the show, it would be the fate of one of the characters, but apart from that I had no complaints)\n        "},

Nay, they are tears are of enjoyment and satisfaction. These tears represent a love for a story that really hit me personally in the heart.\nLet's get started.\n Gurren Lagann is about two brothers who live in an underground settlement. A war of sorts has occurred on the surface which has pushed everyone underground, and fearful of the surface. Kamina, the eldest, and his little brother Simon hate their jobs as diggers and one day\n          \n        stumble upon a mech whilst digging. This helps due to the fact that another mech is attacking the underground settlement, also, a female (who's name I will not mention) has chased down the rampaging mech. Simon and Kamina make haste to help her eliminate the threat, but end up thrown to the surface hundreds of feet in the air. Thus begins, Gurren Lagann.\nKamina, Simon and, (if you haven't guessed which female I was speaking of) Yoko travel back to Yoko's village on the surface. Many adventures are held and a squad is formed to stop the main threat of the show. By episode 8 the show has it's foundation.\nPost-episode 8 the show turns into a Starfox meets Starwars feel.\nThe characters, you really feel for them. And you will cry.\nBy the end of this show you will stand up, clap your hands, and shed some tears.\nGive her a watch."},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Warning: contains light spoilers.\nIf I had to sum up Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann into one word, it would be ignorance.  This is the message that the show preaches consistently, urging the viewer that they should abandon all thought and reason and fight for what they feel is right.  This is the epitome of ignorance, blindly fighting for something that you don't completely understand and being content with knowing nothing.  Multiple times throughout the show, the characters purposefully do stupid things in important moments in order to demonstrate that the will to survive matters more than making smart decisions.  Don't get me\n          \n        wrong, this show is definitely good and this message isn't always a bad one, but in the specific context of this story, the characters are fighting to preserve humanity, when preservation of humanity literally results in the death of the universe eventually due to the spiral nemesis.  This basically boils down to the following logic.  I am fighting to save myself because I want to, and in doing so I am ultimately killing myself AND everything else that would have a chance of surviving if I wasn't doing this.  So not only am I achieving the exact opposite of my only goal in the long run, but I am also dooming all other lifeforms that exist in this fictional universe for no reason at all.  \nThis series repeatedly throws children at your face as it's main justification for taking over the universe.  The desired thought process is, \"look how cute and happy this kid is, humanity must be worth fighting for,\" *turns off brain and goes on killing rampage, ultimately dooming the universe.*  In the shows defense, one could argue that humans are naive and ultimately, extremely ignorant.  Thus, the show is attempting to convey this in a very extreme manner, but I really don't think that's the case as it's main message is \"it doesn't matter if you don't understand something, be a man by screaming really loud with fiery passion and punching whatever feels like it needs punching.\"  If this is the very foundation of humanity, then by God, this series has captured humanity's essence perfectly and I suppose that may very well be the case, sadly enough.  It doesn't exactly leave me with a good taste in my mouth and for as much as I enjoyed the ride, the ending just completely dashed all of my hopes for the plot of this series.\nLet me put it this way so it's easier to understand... Gurren Laggan preaches that grit, perseverance, and heart will allow you to keep on moving forward and achieve your goal.  Through manly spirit and love you can conquer any task.  In doing so, they're basically glorifying the mechanisms by which the goal is achieved, not the distinct goal itself since they don't even tell you the real goal until the end (other than the blanket statement of... fight the power!).  These traits are not inherently good or bad, what makes them good or bad is what they are used to achieve.  You will cheer on a warrior protecting his love interest by slaying foes that threaten her, because this action is good.  But you will not cheer on a criminal as he craftily slinks his way away from the law all the while committing murder, rape, and abuse.  Both of these actions require grit and perseverance; you don't see many hardened criminals who are wimps.  I know, I know, I'm missing the point, right? They are fighting for humanity!!!!!! Well, humans are horrible sometimes, that's just the truth and renders the ultimate message as pretty meaningless, honestly.  I'll say it is optimistic.\nWhat is the result of all this? The result is that I find myself rooting for the villain.  It is so blatantly obvious that you are supposed to hate the villain in this series and root for your gritty protagonists to succeed but to be blunt, taking into consideration the circumstances of this universe I would say that this \"entity\" is not only justified in doing what they did, but that I felt sympathy for them.  Much like Rossiu, they did what needed to be done and everybody hated them for it.  I guess that was technically another theme in this show.  Hm... maybe it was deeper than I thought. Anyhow, anybody remotely rooting for your protagonist isn't going to see it that way, so I would just say the intent of the series has confused itself in that light.  It's preaching one main message that is in direct contraction with another much less significant side message that is probably just supposed to reinforce the main one somehow?\nI suppose the only remaining possibility is that Gurren Lagann is displaying the primal nature that lies within all of us and demonstrating that we will got to any means necessary in order to survive, even if it means our ultimate demise (analogy - a lion extincting its food source in an ecosystem by eating too fast or by some other form of ignorance).  And this would make sense... except, once again all of the messages in this show revolve around valuing humanity, here's to you numerous imagines of crying children.  So no explanation I can come up with really makes sense other than fight the power!  Because all power is worth fighting, right? As long as I feel subjectively oppressed.\nStory (4/10)\nThe story didn't really do anything.  It is best described as a telegraphed journey that basically escalates until it self-destructs.  It was fun, high-octane action but it didn't really have much substance.  The space aspect was pretty cool and there was some decent sci-fi elements thrown in but the show would just make fun of them as being \"stupid\" immediately afterwards so... eh?\nArt(8/10)\nThe art in this series was fantastic.  There was a large amount of high speed animations that were very fluid.  There is also a sense of grandiose present at all times in this series and I think that is one of the reason why it is so loved by many.  Made me feel like a kid again.\nSound (7/10)\nThere's definitely some good tracks here, but they do get overplayed to the point of being annoying.  Still generally enjoyable though, not too much to say here.\nCharacter (10/10)\nThis section gets a 10 simply because of Kamina's existence.  My. God. I will never meet a character like that again.  Props to the character developer for this series, exceptional work.  The large majority of the protagonists are extremely lovable and are handled with care.  They are dynamic and grow from their experiences, the viewer gets to see a generation as well as a family develop, quite heartwarming.  Granted, this family's entire existence is because of Kamina. <3\nEnjoyment (7/10)\nI definitely enjoyed this series. It was nonsense, but it was fun nonsense.  For all of its flaws, it had heart and that is what really defines Kamina and team Gurren.  If there's any non-conflicting message you can derive from this show by ignoring the plot, its Kamina is awesome and fun and you will follow him to the ends of the earth... or space?  \nOverall (7/10)\nThis series would have been absolutely fantastic if it had a real plot that synergized with its message and resulted in Kamina becoming GOD OF THE UNIVERSE... hey, a man can dream, right?\n        "},

And after watching all 27 episodes, you will never forget this name: Kamina.\nHe possessed such strength abd inspiration to everyone he knows and loves. What broke my heart was after the first 7 episodes, the ultimate groundbreaking plot may make the story at loss, then will eventually make sense as the story goes along, thanks to his presence....at everyone's hearts.\nI also like to add that Simon had gotten the most transformation throught all 27 episodes. Well done giving him that many, especially thru the very last episodes!\nOverall, its a 10 from me.\nWhoever still needs to watch Gurren Lagann, do urselves a favour, and get the chance.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    Introduction:\nOn April 7th, 2007, Gurren Lagann aired its first episode on TV Tokyo in Japan. A couple months later Gurren Lagann finished airing on September 30th, 2007. Afterwards the series became hugely successful in North America with critical praise and raving from fans alike. So how does it hold up? Well that's what I hope to answer; on with the review!\nActual Review:\nGurren Lagann tells the story of Simon the digger and his friend/bro Kamina, who have both lived underground for their whole life. As Simon continues to dig, Kamina encourages him to explore \"the surface above the ceiling\", but despite repeated attempts they never succeed\n          \n        in getting anywhere. Then, one fateful day, a huge mech falls from above along with a beautiful girl named Yoko. During the chaos, Simon finds a small mech called Lagann which they use to destroy the evil mech allowing them to escape to the surface; where they see not everything is peaceful.\nNow the story of Gurren Lagann is a little hard to summarize because of its remarkably fast pace. Events happen at lightning speed in this show, but luckily it never feels disjointed or rushed. It's not hard to understand what happens and it all flows naturally, which makes it easy to marathon the series as much as you want to. The passion and style of the show should also be mentioned because every moment of Gurren Lagann feels fiery, confident, and full of exuberance. You can tell the creators of this show had a passion for what they were making, because the whole show oozes love and personality.\nThis leads me to talk about the biggest flaw of the show, it's writing. As the struggle of these characters builds and builds, the show gets progressively more and more illogical. Whenever a problem needs to be solved or even when they need something to drive the plot forward, the story relies on heavy doses of plot-convenience and deus ex machina to save itself. Sure it may come up with some explanation later on, but those are rare instances and even then they usually defy the laws of plausibility. That makes it so anyone watching the show can't apply one brain cell to it, because if they think about what they are watching for one second, the plot will most likely implode. The show also delves into its cheesy lines and crazy screams of anger every once and a while.\nHowever, despite this massive flaw, Gurren Lagann still overcomes that problem with its passion. Like I said before every frame is full of love and personality. In fact one ending about halfway through the show is laid out over concept art, showing that they have been obsessing over this project for a long time and were quite serious about the show. It takes classic tropes from all sorts of old mecha shows and puts them together into one big explosion of stupid awesomeness that always works because of this. As team Di-Gurren says, \"We try to make the impossible possible,\" and the show does exactly that, overcoming some of the plot structure problems. So overall, Gurren Lagann's story is passionate, fun, and is able to get past most of its plot convenience issues. \nNext we should talk about the soundtrack, which, like the rest of the show, is full of bombast. Pop artists and others flocked to the show and produced many great tracks for it. Along with that, the show has a lot of nice orchestrations and consistent melodies to hold it together. One moment it will be a rap song and the next it will be an epic fighting song. It all depends on the moment and the score is varied enough to where it can fit every single one with a different song.\nThe Openings and endings however are not as varied, they all have a similar tone of, \"WE CAN DO IT,\" but don't do anything outside of that. They use one opening song the whole way through, and like the show it's full of passion and confidence; with the song and animation. The Opening also has a nice touch where whenever a major plot event or character gets introduced, they change the animation for the opening to reflect what's going on in the story, it's minor but nice all the less. The Endings are pretty similar, though they don't offer much besides nice stylized walking animation. However the second ending always had me bouncing along with its \"Love and Rock, Love and Rock Peace,\" lyrics. Asides from that though their pretty standard Endings for anime.\nFinally, we have the animation which is great about 95 percent of the time. This was produced by Gainax and, despite the show maintaining its budget well throughout most of its 27 episodes, still has a few scenes and episodes filled with sloppy, goopy animation. The style of Gurren Lagann is a colorful, vibrant one, so when the animation gets bad it looks even more messy than what the last two episodes of Evangelion (Which weren't that bad thanks to Hideaki Anno's direction, but you get my point). However otherwise it's stunning and often very pretty. Action scenes are frenetic and fun, and the motion and cartooniness of it all reminds me a lot of a Saturday morning cartoon. In the end, Gurren Lagann's animation has great style, motion, and nice to look at... Most of the time.\nVerdict:\nGurren Lagann is a great show, but not in the normal way most good shows are. It's plot convenience and cheesy writing should bring the show down to a low status, but thanks to the passion and love behind the scenes the show is able to become a stunning, epic, and fun watch. Gurren Lagann was available from Bandai Entertainment, however since their demise the show has been picked up and redistributed by Aniplex. The same thing also happened for the two movie adaptations Gurren-hen and Lagann-hen, which are retellings of the two major arcs of the show. However, they're not any real substitute for the show, but they do contain a few cool extras so check them out after seeing the series if you want to.\n        "},

I’ve come across a number of such titles, and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann falls into that category. The problem with heavily hyped shows us that you never know if it’s going to live up to all the bragging you’ve heard about it. And I heard a LOT of bragging\n          \n        about this show before I watched it. If you’ve read any of my other reviews, you’ll know that I don’t always enjoy the heavily hyped shows. However, this one deserves the hype it gets…well, mostly.\nBreakdown:\nStory (7/10)- Tengen Toppa Gurren Laggan (hereafter referred to as TTGL) starts off with humble beginnings, following the story of Shimon, a kindhearted boy who drills for his underground village, and Kamina, as hot-blooded, aspiring young man, who dreams of leaving their underground village to see the world above. The village leader tells them that there is nothing above the surface, and they’d be better served to simply dig their holes in the ground. But one day, an enormous machine crashes through the ceiling of their underground home, and proves that Kamina had been right about the existence of a surface world. The plot moves pretty quickly afterward, and soon had Shimon and Kamina are fighting for their very freedom against forces much larger than themselves.\nSound a little cliché? Well, I can assure you that it’s not. While the theme of fighting for freedom has been used a lot, TTGL puts a spin on the idea that I had never seen before. You’ll hear the phrases “fighting spirit” and “spiral power” popping up a lot in this show, which are basically references to the human will, and how it always struggles to survive against all odds. It’s very well done, and had me more or less hooked from the first episode.\nNow, you’ll notice that I only rated the plot a 7 out of 10. What I found with TTGL was that the first half was excellently, and I do mean brilliantly done! The show had me invested in the characters from an early moment, I loved the action, and the theme of “fighting spirit” had me feeling very inspired. After the first half of the show, I found myself thinking “wow, how can this possibly get better”? At this point, I had rated the show at a 9 out of 10, but decided to reserve my final judgments for later.\nWhen the second half of the show opened, something felt…different. It was hard to place my finger on it, but let’s just say that TTGL didn’t pull of a time skip as well as I’ve seen many shows do. It’s hard for me to expound upon why the second half of the show felt so different without spoiling anything, so I’ll have to be vague. Essentially, you’re still seeing all of the same characters, and watching the same show, but everything else seems to have changed. The entire world has become a different place, and it is very different from the TTGL that I grew to love. However, I kept an open mind, and kept watching, figuring that it would eventually be just as good as the first half.\nBut as the show went on, I never felt that same spark of “magic” that made me love it. It certainly wasn’t bad, but it just wasn’t as good as the first half. The second half of the show often repeats the phrase “absolute despair” and becomes rather dark at times. This just didn’t quite sit with me, as the first half of the show was optimistic and over the top, where the second half was depressing and over the top. Eventually, the show became so “over the top” and happened on such a large scale that my brain could barely wrap itself around what was happening at the end. I’m sorry I can’t be any more specific, but it would spoil basically everything if I was.\nI just felt like the show got worse, rather than better in the last few episodes, and ultimately I very much disliked the ending. To me, the ending basically contradicted the entire theme of the show. I felt like the entire show was screaming “You can do anything if you refuse to give up!” But then the ending said “except for this one thing that you can’t do…”. I know that a lot of avid fans will disagree with me, but I really didn’t feel like the ending honored the overall feel and theme of the show.\nThe plot was still very good, especially early on, but it just seemed to decline toward the end…particularly the very end.\nArt (9/10)- I don’t really have a whole lot to say here, other than the art was very good. It was smooth, and drawn in a way that was evocative of the crazy, over the top themes that the show carried. Excellent job, overall.\nSound (9/10)- Very good voice acting, and excellent opening and closing themes. The music toward the end of the show did a good job of conveying the emotions that the characters were feeling, and set a perfect mood. Great sound overall, just not quit deserving of a 10.\nCharacters (10/10)- Who can resist the over the top, never-say-never, “I can do anything” attitude of a character like Kamina? Kamina did so much to influence TTGL in so many ways, that his importance cannot be overstated. In fact, Kamina’s role in TTGL may influence anime characters of the future—he’s THAT big of a character. Really, any shortcomings that the rest of the cast had are almost eclipsed by how brilliant Kamina was in this show.\nShimon, the protagonist, is a bit passive at first, but is later forced into positions of leadership as the show goes on. He eventually takes up Kamina’s mantle, and does a marvelous job of it. These two really make quite a good combination, and make up the heart and soul of everything that TTGL is about.\nNow that’s not to say that every character is as important and moving as Shimon and Kamina (I’m pointing my finger at you, Yoko). Some characters are really just there to fit their specific stereotypes, and others are purely there for fanservice (*cough* Yoko *cough*). And now that I’ve probably enraged every fanboy who reads this, I should make my point. My point is that most of the cast is well done, and has enough personality to fit with characters as big and overpowering as Kamina, however, there are a few exceptions.\nI’d say Yoko is one of these exceptions, not because she’s an annoying or unlikeable character, but she’s portrayed as a main character, and she doesn’t really do much to advance the plot at all. She’s certainly not as useless as, say, Sakura from Naruto, but they easily could have replaced her with a character showing less cleavage, and still told the story perfectly fine. In fact, the character could have been male, and not much would have changed. Yeah, she slings a big gun around, and helps Shimon and Kamina out, but aside from that, she was wasn’t all that remarkable of a character. I suppose nobody is above fanservice anymore, but regardless, I’ve made my point.\nEnjoyment (7/10)- I absolutely loved the first half of this show, but I just felt a steady decline as the second half progressed. Once again, this is only my opinion. Plenty of people enjoyed the second half, and some even like the ending that I thoroughly despised. Once again, I feel like the hype I heard about this show may have actually detracted from my enjoyment of it. My expectations were so incredibly high, that they would have been very hard to meet. This show did meet them for awhile, but fell rather short by the end.\nOverall (8/10)- So is TTGL worth your time? Absolutely! Despite the problems I pointed out, I still very much enjoyed the show. I would only warn you to set your expectations at manageable level, otherwise, you may end up disappointed, as I was. This show does have a lot of redeeming qualities, and I can objectively say that it is very well made, despite my opinions about the plot and ending.\nIn short: definitely above average, but not the anime god that it’s made out to be."},

Now I must suggest, and I will say this at the end of the review, that you go watch this anime. Now then on to the review.\nStory:\nNow I will not even tell you a synopsis of the basic storyline for this anime because it would sound to uninteresting. The anime itself is set into three parts that dissuade any synopsis I can give. The first part is the introduction to all the main characters it lets you get a feel for their characters with many good\n          \n        fights and lines from one specific character. Now I just realized that I forgot to mention that this is a mecha anime. But its a mecha made by Gainax so it isn't your usual mecha story but an alteration of the generic real robo story. I had to explain that because the second part is where it starts to actually resemble a mecha in story to me. It is where the main crew of characters figure out who their antagonist is and go to defeat him. It shows the main character go through changes in his character that no one saw happening as fast as it did. the last third is the wrap-up/epilogue of the story explaining what happened a few years later. This is where some of the most epic scenes and lines emerge. I personally watch the last three episodes at least once a month and still it is as epic as the last time i saw it.\nArt:\nI'm a fan of Gainax's and some of their over the top character designs and mecha designs. This was also my first Gainax anime so after watching Gundam the Gunmen look so off but they grow on you. If you want to know this anime's spokeswoman go google Gurren Lagann and go to images. Don't worry I'll wait. Yeah she gets lots of fanshots, if you know what I mean. Now that has got any guy ready to watch this anime. If your a girl and want to know what this anime has for you. Uh, um, well I guess the guys are mostly never wearing any shirts, I don't know what it is your looking for. I've had like four girls watch this anime and not a single one got it. So, yeah this is mainly made for the men.\nSound:\nOh man, after my fifth time watching this I went and downloaded the OST. It has some of the best songs ever like Viral's Theme, or their main fighting theme. It has the only rap that I will stomach and has the best metal in anime. The sound effects make it sound like a Gainax anime whit mecha's tearing each other apart and all the random explosions going off in rapid succession.\nCharacter:\nThe characters of this anime are mostly in one of two categories. One their meant to be serious at parts and make the hair on your neck stand on end. Their the ones that get all the best lines and make the cool speeches. The others are part of the comedy reliefs. Now almost every character is part of this, including the ones in the first category. But they had to make it humorous. Without characters, like the gay mechanic, the story would have resembled Neon Genesis, and that is something that we didn't need.\nEnjoyment:\nThis is a riot of an anime. You'll watch it, wait a week, then watch it again and still find the jokes funny and the speeches epic. If you know anything about scientific terms you'll laugh at all the random mish-mashing of  the laws of physics in the third act.\nOverall:\nWatch it. NOW!!! If you read this review and didn't watch it I will know. I will then come down to your house with my box set. Strap you down to the most uncomfortable chair I own and have you watch all 27 episodes. Hope you enjoyed my first review.\n        "},

Equipped with the spiraling power of evolution and a mysterious robot, a young boy and his badass \"older brother\" burst from the depths of the Earth and set out on a journey to change the universe.\nIt's hard to say too much about this anime without giving away parts of the story, so I'll just tell you the most important thing, this anime is perhaps the most epic thing ever created. Period. \nStory-10\nGurren Lagann's story is a thing of beauty. This is a story that\n          \n        would be entertaining in any form, any form at all. It's just a huge bonus that someone decided to turn it into an anime. The plot has everything: action, humor, romance, grief, mechas, hot anime girls, super-manly men, and super epicness. It also has some of the best dialogue that I've ever heard. Trust me, you will be quoting from this show. \nArt-10\nThe art for this show can seem pretty crazy at times. There's speed lines and distortions everywhere, but the style really fits the story and adds to the feeling of out of control action. I loved the character designs and the mechs looked amazing. This show is a real eye pleaser.\nSound-10\nOk, sound is not something I really pay too much attention to when I watch anime. Aside from the opening and ending songs I'm usually to engrossed by the show to worry about sound effects and the like. However, Gurren Lagann really made me sit up and listen. The opening and ending songs are the same through the whole series, which is pretty rare for a 27 episode production. Both songs are great, but what really caught my attention were the in-show songs, for the characters and for the background music during important moments. This is an anime that you definitely want to really listen to.\nCharacter-10\nThis is probably the area where Gurren Lagann shines the most. While some of the characters are over the top and there are even some that I downright abhor, for the most part the members of team Gurren are an inspiring bunch of people. The show really does a great job of showing the development and relationships of the characters. The main character especially undergoes an amazing amount of character development. It should be almost impossible to not like at least one character in this show.\nEnjoyment-10\nObviously I really loved the show. Gurren Lagann had me shivering with excitement almost the entire time. The pure epicness of this show forced me to come write a review about it as soon as I finished it, just to get down all the intense feelings that were felt as I watched it. Unfortunately it's hard for me to convey how amazing this anime is. Needless to say, if you haven't seen it you should go watch it immediately. Like now.\nOverall-10 (Obviously)"},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    When I first read the reviews and the ratings, I knew this was a series that I had to check out for myself. The first few episodes didn't appeal to me at all, but I figured the pace might change later in the series, but no, it does not happen.\nIf you don't like the anime in the first 5 episodes, you won't like the rest of it. It's the same repetitiveness with more explosions, different enemies and more allies.\nI think the anime is extremely overrated. Albeit, that doesn't mean it's bad. It was enjoyable, but it didn't put me at the edge of my seat\n          \n        at all. If you're looking for a fun, wacky and all-out anime with crazy sh*t, this is the one for you. If you're looking for a deep Anime that leaves you psychologically and emotionally scarred, this won't do. TTGL is as bland as it can get. Reminds me of dragon ball... Power ups, Never giving up, Fighting new enemies, protecting your friends and planet, etc. Dragon ball was one of my favorite series, but maybe I outgrew that type of genre.\nStory: 7\nDecent story. Few twists here and there. Sometimes it felt too ridiculous and exaggerated.\nArt: 7\nThe characters and mecha are beautifully drawn, however the drawbacks were the battle visuals. They recycled a lot of the same drawings and many battles looked sluggish with weak transitions\nSound: 6\nAverage overall\nCharacter: 7\nThe good old cliche characters. The scared kiddo turned hero, the fearless idiot, the big-breasted airhead, and other typical sidekicks. It's something you would expect out of a wacky anime like this.\nOverall: 7\nIt was fun, but FAR from being a master piece. Overrated in my opinion\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    After having read the synopsis and seen screens from it, I just couldn't understand why this was the number one anime, especially after having watched Death Note and experienced the geniusness in that show. So I decided to watch TTGL, just to see why it was soo popular.\nI had my expectations, but I have to say that I was really poisitivly surprised. The first 10 episodes was pretty good, but nothing special to me. But after the 10th episode I was slowly getting taken by the series and was completely with the story at the end. \nI can't really point out, like I think many\n          \n        of the others that enjoyed the show also can't, what makes this show soo exciting and good. It is like the Gurren brigade, they don't analyse and calculates, they just do. Cause the show doesn't bring anything innoative to the table. The story is pretty similar to a lot of animes in this genre and the characters aren't perticullary deep. But it gives you that FEELING when you are watching. Maybe your head isn't always in the series, but you're heart is, and it gives you that spectacular feeling when the big battles come up. The music is a little bit repeteative trough the series, but it underlines and strenghten the 'TTGL-feeling'. The story moves fast and direct which suits the characters very well. The story mixed with a lot of colours seems fresh, and even if doesn't have any big twists, you really enjoy it. \nEven though I personally don't think this is the best anime out there, I can say after having watched this, that I can understand why it is on the top. It attracts a wide range of viewers and are spectacular in many ways. Even though you may not be sitting with anything new after having seen it, you will be entertained, and then I mean you really will be entertained.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    So actually I rate this anime a 9.5 but since MyAnimeList doesn't do half-point increments you'll just have to know that I rounded up.\nStory: 8/10 \nGiant fighting robots. Not the most original of concepts, but seeing as how this was originally intended as a parody of the mecha genre, it can be forgiven. \nWhat I especially liked about the story was that it started big and ended even bigger. The characters started with lofty ambitions and by the end it had changed into something completely else. It reminded me of Kill la Kill in its final episodes with over-the-top fighting sequences and outer space battles.\n          \n        And by that I mean that it was fucking amazing. \nArt: 9/10\nConsidering this aired in 2007 and probably in production a couple of years before that, the art style still holds up rather well in today's terms. Nowadays, I'm sure Gurren Lagann could be remade with Attack on Titan-style 3D battle scenes with camera angles spinning into the fifth dimension, but there isn't any reason to remake what was already just about as perfect as you can get.\nAnother thing I noticed was that for the first half of the show, the battle sequences cut quickly from one thing to another, probably due to the difficulty of animating such things. But in the second half, the show suddenly pulls out all this CGI and draws out battle scenes without cutting the camera, so to speak. Either the makers got a bigger budget for the second half, or they saved it so that they could stun us.\nReally, the only problem I had with the art was the excessive amount of fanservice. If this was intended to be a parody, the fanservice is probably self-explanatory in that regard. However, there was still quite a lot of it, yet not enough to be over-the-top like Kill la Kill. Gurren Lagann toes the line between \"enough fanservice to not be fanservice\" and \"too little fanservice to be seen as cynical.\" Am I making sense here? Probably not. This show doesn't make much sense anyway, and I mean that in the nicest way possible.\nSound: 10/10\nThe opening is great, the endings are catchy, and the OST is awesome and, for lack of a better word, epic. My personal favorite track was the one that played during fight scenes in the first half of the show, with all the violins and stuff.\nCharacters: 10/10\nNo way could this be getting anything other than a 10 out of 10. Each character, no matter how small their role in the story, left their mark. Yes, even all those members of Team Dai-Gurren whose names I could never remember. All of the characters in Gurren Lagann were memorable. Now, this isn't Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood where each and every character is essential to the story. Yet despite the fact that not all of the background characters were crucial, they all had developed personalities and each character was so awesome that it's hard to pick a favorite out of the many wacky characters of the Gurren Lagann cast.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nI only meant to watch the first episode the night I started it (I actually wasn't planning on watching it for a while due to saving the best for last). Somehow that one episode escalated into the first seven episodes, and it just went from there. Gurren Lagann kept me glued the whole way through, and I really liked how in the first half the show would throw out interesting new characters every single episode.\nOverall: 9.5/10\n9.5/10 for me is much closer to a 10 than a 9. It didn't quite hit the mark of a 10, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it immensely. Gurren Lagann had one of the best climaxes of any story for me, even though it was completely over-the-top like the rest of the show.\nI can see why people wouldn't like the show due to being so unbelievably outrageous, but if you give it a chance, the show draws you in with its infective energy and the thrill of \"What will happen next?\".\nIf I had to describe Gurren Lagann in one phrase, it'd be \"over-the-top.\" Everything was exaggerated and yet somehow still absolutely amazing.\ntl;dr: Watch Gurren Lagann. It's completely outlandish and extremely extravagant, but still manages to make you feel like your heart was ripped out at some parts. And hey, it's on Netflix.\n        "},

Being 20 years old, It felt as if I was simply just too old for it. But I was wrong. This anime's awesomeness increases exponentially as the episodes go. \nI'm really really glad I didn't drop this and sat trough the first 14 episodes, even though I did not like them as much.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    *SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\nWhen I tell someone to watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, they look at me like I'm some kind of retarded monkey. If you haven't seen Gurren Lagann(Or TTGL) then you are missing out on an essential part of human life. If you haven't seen it yet, you can't call yourself a dedicated anime fan.\nStory:- 7.5\nWhen I try to describe TTGL I call it \"Power Rangers on steroids and testosterone\". Every episode has crazy fights with large robots, called ganmen, fighting each other and then rinse and repeat, at least until episode 16.\nAfter episode 16, the anime tries to become serious for a change.\n          \n        This part of the series is the part with some depth to the story, this is seen as the worst part of this series. The decision of whether the serious arc is a good arc or not would depend on the watcher's mentality. In my opinion, the serious arc is not as \"crazy\" or \"fun\" as the first 16 episodes, but it is a good arc if it's not compared to the rest of the show.\nOverall the story is overdone, but is extremely unique in it's own right.\nArt:-8.5\nThe art style throughout the show, is one of the most unique art styles ever in anime. There's a flurry of flashy and quick animation revealed to your human eyes. If you're a seasoned anime veteran and are seeing this for the first time, it might throw you off since the style is so much more different then most other anime.\nThen we have the infamous \"Episode 4\". Episode 4 was an episode which was directed by a man called Osamu Kobyashi. His work is arguably watchable, but for the case of his work in episode 4, it was a disaster. I have, personally, not watched this episode many times during my re-watches of TTGL.\nOverall the anime had a brilliant and new style of are that would've gotten a 10 if not for Osamu Kobyashi.\nSound:-7.5\nI know I might be belted for this, but I didn't find the music in TTGL to be anything outstanding. There were 2 songs that really stand out from the anime though:\n1. The first opening: \"Sorairo Days\"\n2. The famous \"Libera me to Hell\" or better known as \"ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWA\"\nAside from these 2 there are really no outstanding tracks in TTGL.\nAs for the topic for dubs and subs, both are amazing. Every character is near perfectly portrayed in both the sub and dub.\nCharacter:-9.0\nI could just leave this part of the review at \"Who the hell do you think they are?!\" but that would be lazy. So let's go into detail to why this anime has one of the greatest roster of characters.\nSimon:- This is our main protagonist throughout the story. He's sort of a non-bitchy Shinji Ikari(From Evangelion) if you can imagine that. During the first 13 or so episodes, he is basically a toned down version of Shinji. But after those episodes he becomes an amazing and leader-like character. His growth is one of the best examples of great character development.\nKamina:- This is our other sort of main character. In one sentence he is \"The manliest character ever\". Although later on in the story he's used as a tool to allow other characters to grow. He is the father figure for many in the series specifically Simon. Without him this anime couldn't have been as good as it is an Simon would've turned into a copy of Shinji.\nYoko Littner:- Yoko is an... \"interesting\" character. She is really badass at somemoments and at other times she becomes a classic fan-service character. Her character is constantly messed around with throughout the show and it feels like the writers couldn't decide what personality to give her. So overall, she was a badass mess of a character.\nSide characters:- There are many side characters in TTGL. These side characters are usually comic relief characters. There are many brilliant characters in the supporting section ranging from a \"homosexual\" man to a badass villain to a watered down version of Kamina. There is at least one character for everyone to enjoy in TTGL.\nOverall the cast is one of the best casts in all of anime. There is no character who I flat out hated and there were many whom I adored.\nEnjoyment:- 10\nThis is an anime that you really can't think about. There is NO underlying or deep meaning. There is no logic to the story. You need to switch off your brain to watch this and enjoy this. If you just watched something like Code Geass or Death Note before this and then try to watch this, you will hate it. This is an anime that you watch when you just want to have fun. It's not complex, deep or even heartbreaking, aside from a few scenes in the series where you'll almost shed some manly tears.\nIf you don't find this anime good that's fine. But it is definitely one of the most fun and unique anime you will ever find.\nBecause when your characters throw around goddamn galaxies.. You're in for one hell of a ride.\nOverall:- 8\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    Im very confused with this anime. I dont know how I can recommend it, but lets start like this. For fans of mechs. For fans of epic fights, fearless characters and achieving impossible things, this may be a spectacular show.\nFor me though... well I can say I am not amused. Lets start with this. From what I see the anime is divided into three parts. First part being from episode one to episode fifteen. I can say I enjoyed this part. It was fun, it wasnt burdening at all, the characters were silly but funny. There were many flaws but the fact that actually a\n          \n        character died was a big plus for a story like that. Overall I could give this part 7/10. Fun to watch, not burdening, mechs. Overall worth watching. The second part being from episode seventeen to episode twenty two (skipping episode sixteen as it is recap). The secont part went deeper. The characters grew up, got families. They were faced at problems much more complicated than simple fighting. The reason behind everything was revealed and the bigger picture became clear. Overall the story grew up. It became simply awesome and I thought to myself \"Wow. Well this is something. Such an awesome continuation\". This part was simply epic and I would give it 8/10. Not because I didnt like it but simply because this is how I rate. 9/10 is incredible 10/10 is personal score so 8/10 for me who is not the greatest mech fan is as far as I can go. But after this... oh boy the things that happened next. Part three, as I divide them, from episode twenty three to the last one. This was the most ridiculous thing Ive ever seen. Every single logic they put before, every single physics or any law they showed working in this world was shattered. Nothing mattered anymore and they started spitting the words \"spiral\" and \"anti-spiral\" to excuse any bull crap they threw at the audience. Thing after thing they threw away anything they taught you in the previous episodes. And they were repeating the same thing over and over again. Our guys are becoming stronger, and stronger, and stronger, and stronger... over and over. And the reason was \"because determination, power of will and spirals\". Seriously? At the very end I was simply laughing begging them to stop. They were throwing galaxies at each other for F's sake! I just cant give it more than 4/10. It wasnt good for me. I didnt know what I was even watching towards the end.\nOverall the animation was pretty good. I was happy with the style and the quality. The sound was awesome as well. The characters... well they were likable at times, annoying at other times and ridiculous, in the funny and in the bad way at times. Overall I cant say they were very good.\nBut how should I rate it when the quality fluctuates so much over the episodes? My final score I can say is affected by the fact that the ending was really bad. The ending is very important because this is how you make the point. This is where you make a recap of what really happened in your anime. And the ending episodes were simply saying \"Screw everything. Let them throw galaxies at each other and make them fight with big drills because it was cool. Nobody cares about anything at this point anyways.\". So my final score is 5/10. Watch it only if you are big fan of unimaginable fights, or huge fan of mechs. Otherwise the ending will disappoint you so much, that you will not be wanting to watch any anime anytime soon.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Mech anime has always been a divisive genre for me to watch: on one hand, they can have interesting premises and plots that rise above the mech fights themselves to craft more memorable moments for me, but on the other focus too much on mecha battles and hurts its overall plot and pacing. It's a happy sight to see though that Gurren Lagann is able to balance mech fights with plot and pacing surprisingly well that I feel compelled to commend it as the finer mech animations out there. \nThe constant moving and pacing to the show is fantastic, leading to no slogs or crawling\n          \n        that gives energy to fights. The characters all have an air of confidence, courage and freedom to them that makes them likable and engaging. The first part half of the entire series is near perfect with its execution and art style. The music that plays coupled with the voice acting really makes the tone and spirit pierce through (no pun intended) the conventions of mecha shows. Sure, there's a good deal of that in other mechas that have a similar effect, but Gurren Lagann nails it by having strong characters pilot them.  \nThe risk that was taken to kill off such a great character could easily have been a disaster for the show, but in the process made Simon become more endearing and attached to the point where by the second half of the series he holds on to Kamina's legacy and embodies his very soul. The scene with Simon talking to Kamina is one of the most heartfelt and tonally outstanding moments in the show and is one of my favorite scenes in anime. \nThe criticisms I would have for Gurren Lagann (as anything should be criticized to not seem biased and constructive) was the second season/half rushed it's story and went far beyond the scope of what it was trying to say. The grounded world that was in place prior to the Spiral King's defeat was able to make our characters feel like champions in the face of near impossible odds. Now they have conquered, grew a civilization and the plot becomes forced for a new reason to have mech fights. This is of course not entirely bad because the best part about Gurren Lagann is the determination mentality it has: it embodies the spirit of motivation and liberation and through that allows the second half still feel great to watch despite the rushed plot and idea. I'd say as another nitpick is some sacrifices made in the second half didn't execute as well as they should and partly is due to the once again rushed plot and premise.\nDespite said issues, Gurren Lagann is wonderful to me because it burns with such a energetic enthusiasm and delivers great mecha fights that it surprised me almost everytime while also having a great character buildup of Simon throughout the series. The ending is marvelous, emotional and yet hopeful, the art style is creative and great and the music is amazing. With such a achievement under it's belt, Gurren Lagann stands tall among not just mecha anime but alongside all anime for delivering a story of heroism, courage, and hope.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    Giha is a cozy little egalitarian village out in the middle of nowhere.  Nestled underneath a vast, arid desert, this little hole in the ground...  Which, by the way, is a literal hole in the ground...  is the lifelong home of a community of diggers and Pigmole farmers whose lives are occupied with expanding the terrtiry, raising livestock, and living in fear that every single tremor they face could bring them one tremor closer to being crushed to death under a massive Earthquake.  Most of the residents of this piece of prime real estate have resigned themselves to their fate, like\n          \n        the young orphan Simon, who finds comfort in the freedom and artistic expression that his prowess with the expansion drill offers him.  But every peaceful community has that one non-comformist outlier, and that’s where Kamina comes in.\nKamina is your proverbial big fish in a small pond...  He refuses to believe that the surface world is uninhabitable, or that humans weren’t meant to dwell there, and his frustration over the issue leads him to get into quite possibly more trouble than he’s worth.  He’s basically a Reddit conspiracy theorist, and while simon doesn’t necessarily believe in the older boy’s insane ramblings, but he does find a certain reprieve in the boy’s charisma and fortitude.  One day, he uncovers a tiny glowing drill and a giant robotic face while on his latest digging job, and just as he’s about to break Kamina out  of jail to show it to him, a new giant robot comes crashing down through their ceiling, bringing a scantily clad babe with a long sniper rifle, inviting the enire underground populace to witness theiir struggle.\nThe girl, who introduces herself as Yoko, accompanies her new friends in digging up Simon’s giant head, which turns out to be a small but formidable Mech suit that takes his tiny drill as an ignition key!  Squeezing into the cokpit with Yoko and Kamina, Simon the digger defeats the intruder and bursts through the dirt ceiling to enjoy his first ever view of the outdoor sunlight...  But life on the surface is far more dangerous than it had seemed, as Simon and his mutually adoptive big brother must face this bleak terrain with a few friends at their back and an entire organization of humanoid monsters in his path, each of which piloting a mech of their own, and each of which is dedicated to either stomping out the uprising humans or pushing them back into hiding from wence they came.  Having made an enemy out of seemingly the entire world, can Simon hope to overcome the trials and tribulations of the surface world, or will it’s sacrifices become too much to bear?\nI’ve reviewed quite a few Studio Gainax anime in my time, and the word I seem to keep on coming back to is ‘inconsistent.’  Well, I’m simultaneously pleased and horrified to say that Gurren Lagann blows right past that handy descriptor with a level of quality that I can only reasonably call bi-freaking-polar.  When Gurren Lagann looks good, it’s top tier stuff, with fast-paced action, brilliantly integrated CG, and a cool, confident sense of style in it’s presentation and cinematography.  Since these breathtaking turns take place during giant mech battles and all-out space wars, you could easily say that the money was spent where it needed to be spent.\nHaving said that, when it’s bad, it’s hideous.  I’m not the first person to point out how ugly episode 4 looks compared to the better moments of the `series, and yeah, that entire episode...  Mech content and all...  Is a noticeable blemish on the series.  Gainax does sometimes have a penchant for outsorcing it’s work, and that entire episode was directed by a different person from the rest of the series...  And the results probably played a huge part in him not being invited back.  But it goes beyond just that episode.  Throughout the series, but particularly in the first third, the budget saving tactics are embarassingly obvious, running the gamut between broken frame rates, talking heads and key frames, and I hate to say that even the giant mechs suffer from this from time to time.  000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\nThe animation gets better as the series goes on, to the point when we reach the explosive galaxy-hopping climax where I swear to God everything finally looks as perfect as the creators probably wanted it to since episode 1.  It doesn’t make up for all the shortcomings that came before it, but you know what?  The over-all look and design of the series kind of does.  I don’t think I can name any other series that had this inspired of an aesthetic before.  The look of each character speaks volumes about who they are and what they’re like, and while this element isn’t taken to the same kinds of extremes that it was in Utena, they still look really cool.  Remember what I said about Kiddy Grade’s side characters looking like they got taken out of a drunk artist’s notebook?  Imagine that, but with focus and a distinct sense of direction, and you’ve got the characters from Gurren Lagann.  The robots look awesome too, just as diverse and interesting looking as the people who pilot them, from a two-faced Optimus Prime with shades to a supporting mech that looks like a cross between Staryu and The Dancing Banana.\nThe soundtrack is surprisingly diverse, hitting unerxpected genres as jazz and operatic/rap vocals mixed among much more common shounen orchestrations.  All of it is loud and attention grabbing, none of it is subtle or underplayed, and yet it’s all used with consistent perfection.  I’d fall back on the old cliche that there’s “something for everyone” here, if it wasn’t for the fact that I feel like most audiences would eat up the entire damn score.  The jazzy funeral music is a nice somber listen, but if I had to pick a favorite, it would be the theme song of antagonist Viral, which has to be one of the most pulse pounding fight songs I’ve ever heard from that side of the ocean.  The op and closing themes are disappointingly standard by comparison, but they’re not bad by any means.\nThe english dub, on the other hand, is not without it’s common complaints.  The biggest one comes in the shape of Kyle Hebert in the role of Kamina, and honestly, I don’t get the hate.  He’s nowhere near as inspirationally insane as the Japanese actor, but he holds his own adequately enough.  Give the guy a break, he had a tough act to follow.  It’s not like he sucked up the joint.   Then again, Yuri Lowenthal had a muchtougherthey  job as simon, and he nails it with flying colors.  You can generally 4441111111111111111111111111111111111xpect a character who ages through out the story to havfs lots of character development, and he has no problem sticking with his character through the whiny early years and into the much deeper and more masculine adult years.  Michelle Ruff gives a very subtle performance as Yoko, and while she of course knows how to hit all the notes perfectly, she also knows to keep a lot held back in order to complement the forces of personality that she’s been paired with.  Steve Blum playing an effeminate gay man is so, so perfectly beautiful a thing.\nJohnny Yong bosch does a good job as the pragmatic Rossiu...  Because of course he does...  But he’s a bit over-qualified, and it feels like his talents were being under-utilized.  Maybe if he’d been the one to play Kamina instead of Hebert, this dub would be more popular?  In any case, Jamieson Price plays one of the main villains, which you know damn well is a good sign, and while I appreciate the fact that most actors here kept their roles past the time skip, Nia didn’t.  She’s a very inquisitive character who doesn’t know anything about human society and has millions of questions to ask about it, which is why it was so perfect that they hired Hynden Walch, the voice actor behind similar fish-out-of-water Starfire from The Teen Titans, and having her grow up into Bridget Hoffman was a stroke of genius.  There’s a very large cast in this dub, and while it never really gets bad, it’s still nowhere compared to the original sub.  If you’re a dub fan, this one is perfectly fine...  But otherwise, I’d have to recommend the original version based on the strength of Kamina alone.\nBefore I go into anything else, I’d like to start by addressing the one thing everybody seems to agree with in regards to this series.  It’s something that critics and fans alike are quick to point out, to degrees of pride and shame that would quite frankly surprise you.  That fact is that Gurren Lagann is one of the stupidest anime ever made.  There is nothing in it that makes sense, from the basic mechanics of a drill being used to combine machines all the way to some game changing plot revelations in the final arcs, there is not one solitary moment where it feels like the writers actually sat down to decide how the universe works, except for the explanations so out there that they give serious cred to the age old excuse “A wizard did it.”  Now, I’ve ripped apart plenty of anime for being stupid, but in Gurren Lagann’s case,m is it really such a bad thing?  Well, yes and no, but to 11qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqexplain why, we’ll have to explore the positive and negative aspects of it’s b1qrainlessness.\nAll right, what’s good about Guirren Lagann being stupid?  Well, a lot of things, really.  Gurren Lagann subscribes to a binary that valueus belief over doubt, and in support of this, it openly and proudly embraces ignorance and stupidity as the ultimate solution to overcoming the impossible.  The world it takes place in quickly begins to feel like a world where virtues such as strategy and reason are valued substantially less than masculinity, courage, and balls-out bravado, and the reason it works so well is that, for the most part, it’s consistent enough in execution that it believably becomes the law of physics in this particular canon...  Which is all well and good, but you could say something very similar about the first two seasons of RWBY, which did nothing for me.  \nOn that note, the difference between RWBY and Gurren Lagann can be summed up by examining a few key ideas, my favorite of which is an idea RWBY had called The Forest of Forever Fall.  Basically, it’s a forest that’s in perpetual autumn, with leaves always flowing to the ground.  Logically, this makes about as much sense as hippos evolving to be covered with giant grapes, like they did in Gurren Lagann, but how is it used in the story?  Well, the Forest is used as a backdrop for the character development of Jean, who’s turn towards manliness thanks to the conquering of a few bullies has NOT been brought up since, nor has the Forest, and to my recollection, neither have the bullies.  What puts Gurren over RWBY is that while it had a lot of crazy ideas, it never feels like it crowbarred them in just to waste your time.  The grape hippos are livestock and meat, nothing more.\nSo what’s bad about this show being stupid?  For one thing, it robs it of any substance or depth.  Gurren Lagann is pure spectacle, and if it wasn’t for a few saving graces (One of which I’ll get to later) I would honestly consider it the anime equivalent of a Michael Bay movie.  I’ve tried analyzing it, and aside from it’s basic coherence to The Hero’s Journey story structure model, the drill symbolism and genetic metaphors seem to be hinting at the message that you should be proud of your dick.  The issue of over-population comes up a few times, but it’s treated as bullshit at every turn.  Beyond that, the story is very simple, and there’s a lot of room for stupidity...  Up until the story arc directly following the time skip, where our heroes have aged by seven years and established their own goverment.  The story tries to be all serious and political here, but the only feeling it elicits is a constant string of “WTF”s as it tries in vain to utilize concepts it’s not mature or intelligent enough ot understand.  \nBefore I could even come to terms with the idea that this advanced, futuristic society could have been erected by humans with little to no experience with above-ground architecture in only seven years, not even bothering to explain where all the materials came from out of the vast wasteland they had to work with, or how this team of fighters were somehow all suited and qualified to run a government in the first place, I was forced to swallow the idea that a leader making one simple, understandable, honest mistake that anybody could have made that caused a ton of structural damage but no specified human loss, could turn the public against him so quickly that he gets sentenced to death and they wind up falling back on the classic imagery of a dictator’s statue being pulled over.  Thankfully, this arc was mercifully short, and Gainax decided to rush through it to get back to the stuff they were good at in the first place.\nSo yeah, the plot is stupid.  The story is stupid.  For better or worse, everything is stupid, stupid, stupid.  Well, aside from the political missteps, the character writing is anything but dumb, and it’s easily the strongest element of the series.  Gainax has always loved writing coming of age stories that showcase the growing pains of male characters, and while Gurren Lagann’s not really their best show, Simon the digger is probably the best character that they’ve put through that formula.  I’m not gonna lie, there’s some Shinji in his early episodes, but it’s not unwarranted Shinji-ness.  He goes through some shit that would make YOU emo for a few days, too, from seeing his crush hook up with his best friend, to overhearing someone close to him emasculating him in conversation, to...  Um...  Spoiler stuff.  He starts off as a tag-along, perfectly happy to be the sidekick of one of the most charismatic leaders in anime history...  I’ve spoken about this at length in my Top Ten Siblings list, but he idolized and idealized Kamina to the point that when it was time for HIM to step up, he found himself unable to do so, until something amazing happened.\nI’ll spare you the spoilers, but to paint it in broad terms, Gurren Lagann fills out Simon’s character arc by taking one of my least favorite pieces of stock advice and making it work.  I think I’ve always hated that old mantra of “Just be yourself,” because it’s dishonest...  The sad truth is that society does have expectations, people do expect you to follow basic social norms, and unless you’re already the kind of person who fits them(or breaks them in superficially appealing ways), you do have to adapt to avoid being a lonely loser.  Gurrem Lagann takes that phrase from another angle...  Growing up doesn’t mean becoming like the heroes and role models from your childhood, it means breaking away from them and being the best YOU that you can be.  You don’t have to become your idealized icons to be a good person.  you don’t have to wind up with the pin-up models you used to idealize when there’s a down to earth, sweet girl right under your nose.  Stop trying to aim for your role models, and become one yourself.\nUnfortunately, as perfectly complex and fulfilling as Simon’s development is, everyone else seems to exist in service to it, which I’m kinda okay with.  This is HIS story, and to that end, I don’t really think anybody was underutilized, with the possible exception of Yoko Littner.  She was a really cool and interesting character, who was competent in a fight, kind and generous, and wasn’t afraid to admit or pursue the things she wanted, but as soon as the love triangle was resolved, she basically got demoted to secondary character so a new main female character could enter the story...  One with a much more interesting backstory, granted, but one who would be fridged towards the end of the series due to some random bullshit that came out of nowhere and was completely unnecessary. adding emotional stakes to a story where the very existence of humanity was already on the line.  Still, for there to be even one complex female main character who’s treated fairly and with respect in such a testosterone fueled dick fest, let alone two of them, is still pretty amazing in it’s own right.  \nEvery character in the cast has something to offer to it, even if it’s not so evident right away.  The stereotypical gay character is never painted as a predator, but actually acts as the engineering genius of the group.  The hot blooded cocky dude who acts as a rival for Simon’s leadership steps aside as soon as he knows he should, and genuinely feels like he cares about everyone.  Villains working under the Spiral King have their very own co-worker dynamic, and the political mini-arc is almost saved by the emotional turmoil that the bureaucratic character goes through as he lays down the law.  I guess it’s hard to feel sad watching side characters die when they barely had any lines up until that point...  And one of them has a wife and kid who’s reactions are never shown, which I’m sure was an honest mistake by the writers...  But I still cared so much about the main cast that I felt every loss, and in a cast this huge, that’s saying something.\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is available from Aniplex of America, which unfortunately means you’ll be dealing with a distinct level of scarcity from it.  It’s out of print, and the dubbed version can cost you a pretty penny on Amazon, which is why I’m pleased to report that there are some pretty damn good deals available on Ebay, where you can get the thinpack Brand New for between 20 and 30 dollars. It can also be found for streaming on both Crunchyroll and Netflix.  A follow-up manga adaptation is available stateside from Bandai Entertainment, but the light novel unfortunately is not.  Two movies were released in 2008 and 2009 that retold the story with better pacing ARE available stateside from Aniplex, but they’re just as obscenely expensive as the series can be, and I hate to say it, but Ebay isn’t gonna help you with that one.\nWhen I realized that my 50th official review would be dropping in Studio Gainax month, I knew that I had to review one of Gainax’s big three titles.  I picked Gurren Lagann not only because it’s arguably their most popular, and not only because I had the most to say about it, but because it’s right in the middle...  Better than Evangelion, but not quite as good as FLCL.  It has it’s fair share of problems, as I’ve no doubt proven by now, but what Gainax show doesn’t?  The way it’s able to work most of it’s worst aspects to it’s advantage suggests that there might actually be method to it’s madness, and an intelligence lurking below it’s stupidity.  Even if I’m wrong about that, it’s still one of the most fun, passionate, energetic, and over-the-top anime out there.  It takes a lot of confidence to boldly champion the values of dumb machismo, and it takes nothing but pure sincerity to back it up.  I give Gurren Lagann an 8/10.\n        "},

TTGL not only deals with real things, but with real things that only a show like this can really express.

Some surprises will await, but this is not that complicated as far as stories go.\nBut people watch this show for the sheer energy it gives off, rather than the actual events that take place.\nAnd I don't blame them: look at all these\n          \n        people with their sunglasses piloting their mechas and spouting one-liners like their lives depend on it.\nUnfortunately, the best part about this show is also a double edged sword. \nI occasionally find it difficult to take story information in because I just feel so drained after watching all these battles.\nThe show is more balanced than I'm hyping it up to be - it isn't constant brainless fighting.\nBut it just sucks out my energy after a while, and I just can't take it.\nThis shouldn't put you off though. This show is all about empowerment, and it can do an excellent job with that when it wants to.\nAs far as art and sound go I'm pretty impressed.\nThe art is very stylised and distinctive. Like a perfect marriage between a western action comic and a traditional anime - it fits the show perfectly.\nAgain, the double edged sword strikes back. Sometimes it looks a little too stylised for my tastes and almost appears dated as a result. But that's more of a personal gripe if anything.\nThe music and sound are also up to scratch. The VAs are fine, the soundtrack works and the OP is catchy as ever. I knocked off some marks for constant reuse of a certain rap-opera song in the last few episodes though. It sounded great at first but the constant repetition of it eventually ruined my experience of it.\nThe characters are one of the best bits of the story. All the development and plottwists happen here - and they happen well.\nEverybody is a badass in this story, or rather - everybody becomes a badass.\nThere are plenty of backstories and motivations to keep you interested without disrupting the flow of the plot.\nNo character is incredibly deep but they don't need to be. They're just constantly evolving people. Even the ones that don't fight do a good job of balancing out the story. \nSome of them do annoy me but it's not enough to bring this down. I like these characters, they're just too cool.\nSo to wrap it all up, I very much enjoyed Gurren Lagann.\nIt's a little exhausting at times, but I'm pretty sure most others will endure that.\nPerhaps it was the pacing that made me feel that way? Maybe it's just because I was out of my comfort zone.\nIf I had watched this show when I was much younger, I have the feeling I would've enjoyed it more.\nAt that time I loved this kind of stuff. Now I'm simply not energetic enough to enjoy such a show as much.\nI respect Gurren Lagann a lot, and I reccomend everybody new to the mecha or action genre to watch this.\nIt doesn't suit me entirely, but it was a proper thrill ride.\n        "},

When Kamina cheers you on you cheer up, when everyone wins\n          \n        you feel like you've won too, when everyone cries you feel like your heart is being torn out.  And boy, episode 8 really goes for the metaphorical jugular of feels.  I could not stop crying at the end of episode 8.  Prepare yourself for that because this anime does a great job of building you up and then ripping you down violently and without mercy.  Episode 8, man.\n-Art-\nSo amazing and fluid!  Very interesting style of having the faces of the mechas in the body.\nThe second season utilizes a bit too much panty and butt shots in my opinion, but I consider than a sort of occupational hazard when you call yourself an anime geek.  \n-Sound-\nAwesome!

I've already seen two great ones in Code Geass and Neon Genesis. Then came Gurren Lagann a very beloved mecha series that I haven't watched til bout a few months ago. After watching it in English Dub here are my thoughts.\nStory: 9/10\nStupid but VERY effective. The plot is epic, filled with energy, humor, and just very fun. It also had some unpredictable moments that added complexity and delivered positive messages w/o trying to preach. However it doesn't get a perfect score cuz there was a time when the series tried to\n          \n        enter the serious route and it just didn't work and starts to drag things down. But overall it was very inspiring and well executed.\nArt: 8/10\nThe designs were great in particular, the Mechas. The animation was also for the most part very smooth and made the action and movements look great. It also got better as the series went on However it wasn't always consistent as there was an episode where it threw me off completely and it just didn't fit well with the remaining episodes. The visuals would also throw some people off as it will take time to get used to it.\nSound: 8/10:\nThe biggest standout here was the voice acting. Majority of the characters had their voices fit them like a glove, plus they were speeches that were well handled thanks to good dialogue and good delivery. The music wasn't anything special but were used great for the battle scenes. If there's one thing the music did do it was get \"Row Row Fight the Power\" stuck in my head.\nCharacter: 10/10\nW/o a doubt the best part of the series. The character development for this cast was perfect. So many likable characters with each given their moments to shine. Kamina brought so much charisma to the show and was very influential. Then u had Simon who imo is one of the most well developed characters in ALL of anime. Started off as a shy and humbled kid who relied on others to being his own man. Almost everyone matured and change as the series went on while still keeping their core personalities which made them even more likable. Plus the villains were pretty cool.\nFinal Verdict\nGurren Lagann is an anime that's not meant to be taken seriously. It's an anime that mainly focuses on being entertaining and it DEFINITELY did that. The characters alone would were just good to watch and they were so worth it. But it wasn't just fun, it was overall a great anime series and it's one of the best mechas an Anime fan can watch."},

That has to be a mistake nothing is really that good right? Well you are mistaken my friend this show gurren lagann is a one of a kind. Literally it is an original work with no source material, that is just impressive. The art in the series is a beautiful, playful and unique style. It has a lot of colour and bright transformations. The music is really engaging and helps set the scenes which I find quite rare in a\n          \n        lot of other shows. Now the meat of the anime is in the story and the characters. One thing that must be acknowledged is after the halfway point the transition between the halves is huge. I personally found the fist half less engaging and honestly almost stopped but it was way worth it to finish the story (Im not gonna spoil it). So our leads Simon and Kamina are the bro'est of bro's. The manliest of men. The most passionate and tough. Now yes Simon is whiny and complains a lot but Kamina is there to guide him through the tough times, and they come out stronger for it. Later they encounter Yoko (not the on that dated John lennon). Basically a love interest/fan service, come on you've all seen that bikini. Our trio of characters take on the coolest most bad ass journey in almost any anime I've seen. Now I could talk about this show for hours but I don't have that kind of time. If you're reading this to see if you should watch this then my answer to you is WATCH THIS. Any of your typical shounen, or mech, or story driven fans will love this. And personally this is one of the few must watch shows everyone has to watch in mt own biased opinion of course. And if you haven't watched this anime yet? Do it now.\n        "},

The characters start at the lowest of the low, living under constant oppression beneath the ground. They find a\n          \n        tiny mecha about the size of a washing machine and a tiny drill which functions as an ignition key. By the power of determination, friendship, and believing in themselves, they overcome every obstacle thrown at them. They go from underground dwellers to the Earth's surface, where they must fight increasingly bigger and more powerful enemies with even bigger mecha, to the limits of the imagination of the show's creators.\nWhere this show excels above the rest is in that it is actually very entertaining. There is no fat, it has an excellent pacing. It manages to use all of its cliche and its simpleness to its advantage to deliver a very exciting experience without any complexities from start to finish. \nThe show is all about teaching you to believe in yourself and never give up no matter what destiny throws at you and how impossible the obstacles are to overcome. It's cliche, but the show delivers that message very well because it does it with a lot of heart. It will pump you up. You will buy it.... You will buy it all,  including the characters, who despite that their character development is just growing in confidence and determination, cliche romances and camaraderie, I became very fond of them all.\nThe presentation is very well done too. Despite it being 10 years old, it looks as good as anything there is today. The artworks and sound are very well done. I know for some it is a sacrilege, but I recommend the English dub over subtitles because it is also very well made.\nOverall, this show was very entertaining from start to finish. Watching it left me very pumped up, with a feeling that I as well can grow a pair and overcome anything. It most likely will not be the greatest show you've ever watched, but I would recommend anyone to see it. I think very few will regret it if they do.\n        "},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I already know before I opened this tab, before I opened google chrome, and before deciding that I would review Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann that this would be a controversial review simply because I do not think it is an \"outstanding\" anime. For a lack of a better comparison, I feel like the hype I received to before watching this anime was similar to Citizen Kane or Lord of the Rings- this was an anime that was considered untouchable, bulletproof in a way. As a person who hates things being hyped up to critical status for me, it is entirely possible that the reason I\n          \n        didn't enjoy TTGL was simply because people wouldn't stop talking about it to me. I watched the first half of it and was quick to dismiss it because I felt it dragged on and was in a bit of a sour mood about the whole thing, but shortly afterwards I watched the whole thing in one sitting and enjoyed it more than I expected, but still found some problems with it. So lo and behold, I don't think Gurren Lagann is \"untouchable\" or \"outstanding\", but it's pretty damn good.\nIt's really hard to go into great depth with the details in this anime without indulging in spoilers, so I will steer far clear from trying to deconstruct this anime and rather tell you how I feel about it and what you should expect going into it. Another point to pull is to mention that I'll be referring to \"first half\" and \"second half\" a lot in this review, because a lot of my opinion revolves around the differences between the two.\nSTORY: 6\nA lot of interesting things go on in Gurren Lagann's story, lots of twists, interesting decisions, specific moments- but nothing really culminates into a whole well. While the ending is extremely impactful, it is more a testament to the character's improvements and their dynamics rather than the story surrounding them. It almost feels like you have real life human beings thrown into a world of cardboard cutouts, a cast of amazing well rounded people bouncing around façades of actual plot development just so they can improve themselves. You'll meet a group of characters with amazing expression and complicated backstories, but the way they meet is usually a complete coincidence without any real effort in tying the strings together except a lazily slapped \"Oh uh, I guess they just stumble upon them in the desert\".\nThe plot also feels like a straight line. There are a few bends, but no real complexity. This is somewhat relieved in the second half of the anime, where all of the character's interactions and what they've done up to that point culminate in what is for lack of better words, completely epic- but the first half being literally \"stumble upon some characters, then shoot stuff\" is extremely bland, boring, and drags on for way too long.\nThere's a lot of depth in Gurren Lagann, but not in the plot of the show. It all belongs to the characters and who they are.\nART: 8\nStudio Gainax never seems to disappoint in the art department. And while to date, I think this is their least appealing anime in terms of art (ok, I'm not counting the budget-cut episodes of evangelion) it still completely blows my mind out of the ground and makes my eyes bleed. There is always something flashing, something spinning or blinking, the lines are very sharp and defined and there is explosions all over the screen for most of an episode's runtime. Despite all this, the downsides revolve around a lot of the anime falling into \"good animation, generic setting\"- while the world is set in a post apocalypse of sorts, the what I like to call \"Dragonball Z Rock Desert\" setting is rather boring most of the time and doesn't compliment the amazing art style well. This is amended in the second half however, and only then I can say that this anime is a true beauty to look at.\nOh, I almost completely forgot about the title cards. I want each one in a massive print hanging around my house. They're that good.\nSOUND: 7\nLots of people say that this is the best soundtrack \"of any anime, ever\", But they only ever seem to bring up \"Libera Me From Hell\" and \"Sora Iro Days\"- which brings up the point that in my opinion, the soundtrack is completely hit or miss. When the music is good, it's absolutely amazing. Those two tracks mentioned above are some of the most inspiring, pumping up music I've heard in an anime- enough for me to say that they almost carry the entire 7 points on their backs alone. That's not to say the rest of the soundtrack is awful by any means, but it's completely forgettable and not really unique to any sort of style or taste. I could listen to a song (except the two mentioned above) from the OST in a cafe and not recognize it as a Gurren Lagann song, and I could listen to most of the songs and completely forget about them 5 minutes later. They're just really bland and while each one fits the mood for individual aspects of the show, I would never really go out of my way to listen to one except the two mentioned above.\nNow the memorable songs from Gurren Lagann are so good that I would actually give this category a higher mark than 7- but the voiceacting still stands. And no matter what version I watched, I thought it was simply just passable. For every great voice, there is a weak one- Kamina's dominating strong voice is countered by the annoying shrill tones of Simon. Yoko's voice bounces all over the place and frequently goes from annoying to soothing, and the minor characters are hit and miss as well.\nCHARACTER: 10\nI've already touched upon the characters in the \"story\" section of this review, but dear god are they amazing. Each character has complex motives, an interesting backstory, and a deep interaction with each other character. Every character acts like you'd expect them to, but it comes off as a human expectation rather than just a bland soup of stock (soup? stock? get it?) characters. Each character has expectations, and their moods fluctuate in ways that few animes dare to tread- lasting several episodes based on recent events revolving around them and how they feel about them. Despite all this complexity, you don't need a manual or guide to each character as it is laid out simply and perfectly for you in a way that I cannot describe short of excellent. But the crowning achievement above all of this is the character progression. I literally cannot step into this category without spoilers, but the way the second half gathers up all the characters, what they have gone through and what they are now and bundles them up in a small space together to interact is beautiful and something I have never seen before.\nENJOYMENT: 7\nWhile there were times where I was awestruck in how much fun I was having with TTGL (mainly in the second half), there was almost an equal amount of time where I spent kind of twiddling my thumbs waiting for the anime to hurry up. Mainly the first half seems to almost get TOO formulaic near the transition to the second half, to the point where it's completely predictable and doesn't leave any surprises or joy to be had. There was also a few episodes that seemed out of place (I'm looking at you, hotsprings and random animation drop episodes) but other than that I mostly had fun with Gurren Lagann.\nOVERALL: 7\nTo sum up all I have ever thought of Gurren Lagann after watching the whole thing, the first half is a solid 6/10 and the second half is a complete masterpiece. That being said, the first half is essential in introducing us to the fleshed out cast of amazing characters and in a way that makes me resent the boring, predictable nature of it even more. If there were a way to inject information straight into your brain without having to watch the first half, I would definitely recommend a skip to the second half. But as it stands, the second half is not nearly as impactful unless you experience each character for long enough and truly get to know how they work and how they think.\nI would definitely recommend TTGL. But I wouldn't hype it up for people like others did for me. The times I have recommended it I have only mentioned \"I think you'll like it\", not this impenetrable halo of ultimate fanboyism (I apologize for using that word) surrounding it.\n        "},

This story is about a timid and shy boy grasping his fate of living underground and drill it through toward the sky!! With the help of his sworn brother and the people he meet along the way.\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann captivates the essence of an anime. It combines many different genres and incorporates it into a single anime. It is a piece of work unlike any other and it could get you from feeling all pumped up to all \"tingly\" inside in an instance. Although that is its strong\n          \n        point, it is also it's weak point, the director may have gotten the feeling across but didn't prolong it long enough for it to reach the maximum potential. However this one unique point made this anime into one of a masterpiece in many different aspects but it has some loopholes.\nThe first half starts out really fun to watch. It all packed with energy, action scene, punk and mecha to hook you in to its deepest core. Mecha battle one right after another it packed with witty, simplistic quotes that really echos through out the entire anime.. like the phrase they said at the moment of proving oneself to the world \" WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK WE ARE!!\" That one really stick with me. This adventurous anime really take you to the distance without holding anything back  which make this absolutely exhilarating!! But that one for the first part. Where you have a typical anime. A party of rebels gathering together to confront the king who has condemned them live underground. \nThe first half reminded me of Mobile Suit Gundam Seed where we have a timid guy who doesn't like to fire, but fight for others and then he meets the princess.\nIn some sense it is very similar until the second half uncovers\nThe first half is fun, entertaining and adventurous. In the second half it evolves into something much for deeper and grand but this is not the only big difference and that is that they had a 7 years overlap.  They went from young adolescences to mature young adults. In the second half many characters stayed the same but many have changed. Like Yoko, she was a most developed character with here playfulness and general attractiveness, but a character of her caliber and existence was treated with unfair judgement. She disappear for the beginning of the second half and then when we needed her the director gave us a quick summary of where she was at. Kamina was another character that was well liked, because of his charisma and fun personality. However if he had not died in the early series, Simon wouldn't have evolved and the story wouldn't grow as well. Having a strong character to start is a complex production that needed to be executed well to make it successful if the character was kept alive, but since they took the alternative route, they story took a different, which still made it look strong!(impressive)\nThe drastic changed in anime style between the first and second half differs from survival of the fittest where power is all the matters to brain is now essential. They went from fun and exhilarating to serious and  complex then back to fun and entertaining. It's like two people are working on the script experimenting and failed for a complete change!\nThe music in this anime isn't epic enough to make it shine. The anime is epic already with the art of draft-like pencil scenes to sharp and bubbly. However with the general BGM inserted it still made it work, so no complaints there. \nAnyway.. i guess the lesson or message here is that those who refuse to change will not see the essence of life. Gurren Lagann is a very fun anime to watch, its far from perfection but have very few flaws. It has a little something for everyone, from A little Romance, to Friendship, brotherhood ,Adventure, lots of Mecha Action, a little comedy and \"bad-ass-ary\" so I would recommend it for everyone. However I personally would say this particular piece of work is more appealing to male audience, but ladies give it a shot.. because you never know~"},

To say anything else would really be a disservice to the series. In it, the action and characters shine  above all else. The series may not have many cards to play as a whole, but what it does have oozes quality and dedication that few other series can match. \nThe weakest part of the entire series is the plot. Basically, there isn't one in the long run. It boils down to a formulaic pattern. Characters roam for adventure, characters find a problem, characters solve the problem (usually in defeating\n          \n        the bad guy). Thankfully, this isn't really the point of the series though. Honestly, the very simple plot keeps the focus on the points that do matter most to the series: characters, art, and sound. \nBesides a hiccup on episode 4 (i don't even know what happened there) the series is consistent on art quality. It handles the fast paced action excellently. Every action feels like there is weight behind it. The strength and power of the blows and actions are translated well. The later episodes present a unique twist and flair to battles and environments as they get bigger and in completely new areas. It truly is one of the best action oriented art i've seen.\nThe sound is top notch as well. The actual amount of variety that the series offers is pretty low compared to other series, but the amount of ways they use them is impressive. One song can serve for an emotional scene, suspense moment, and more. On a smaller scale, the battle sound effects are great and the voices match their personalities. Even the intro and end scene songs are great. It all just meshes well. \nThe absolute strongest area that the show has is in the characters. The characters shine above the rest even with the other excellent pieces. The actual character progression is outstanding. Simon in particular starts as a boy and becomes a man by the end. He quivers and shys away from a fight and just can't believe in himself. But despite this, Simon grows to understand himself on a deeper level and works through his problems. The better part of this is that all the characters grow in their own way. They deal with deaths, tragedy, success, and their journey together and show their unstoppable determination. I could write so much more on this, but that would take all day to finish. \nThis series probably deserves a more in depth look on every level. My love for these characters translates far beyond just watching the series. It inspires one to go beyond their own expectations and to aspire to be better in every way. It shows how people step up and makes the hard decisions. It shows how humanity isn't bound by walls built by others, but that they can reach limits the defy logic. It leaves me inspired and rearing to face the world. My only hope is that this review does it justice. \n        "},

My friend doesn't really care for the show all that much and he simply cannot grasp the reason behind why this show is so popular and adored by many.  With this in the back of my mind, I started off the show with a slight bias.  However, that bias soon disappeared and I realized that perhaps my friend and I are not\n          \n        so alike after all. I'll mention my reasoning behind this later on in the review.

This kept the story simple, to the point, and easy to fully enjoy.  \nArt- 10: I loved the animation and you can tell (except for a few small things) that the animators put a lot of work behind the animation of this show.  Towards the end there even seems to be a slight increase in quality which makes the fight scenes that much more amazing to watch.\nSound - 10: I am not an expert when it comes to sound (or doing anime reviews for that matter) but the I appreciate the OST's used in this anime.  The BGM during certain fight scenes feel heroic and superman-like. At the same time, there are other songs that are surprisingly good at setting a more depressing tone. I also loved the opening of this anime. Really fits Gurren Lagann as a whole.\nCharacters- 10: Most of the characters in this show are likable and have their own unique, fun things about them that make you enjoy watching them. I felt bad for Yoko in a sense because she pretty much had to take the brunt of the fanservice responsibilities. Haha\nEnjoyment- 10:  Okay, I have always felt that it's not the anime itself that you are scoring when rating an anime, it's the impact it's had on you.  Before watching Gurren Lagann, I was prepared to fully accept the fact that this anime will disappoint me and was just watching it to see why it is raved over so much.  However, Gurren Lagann was one hell of a ride.  I really enjoyed this anime.  It's been a long time since I've been so pumped up while watching an anime.  It makes you feel like you are on top of the world at times and that nothing will ever stand in your way.\nOverall-9: Gurren Lagann is an anime that was not meant to be taken seriously.  The show doesn't even take itself seriously.  This show is so extreme and over-the-top that if you tried to take it seriously, you will only be disappointed and probably hate this show.  With that said however, this silly, simpleminded, parody of an anime is what makes it so great.  It's simplicity is what allows the doors to be opened to display the true beauty and epicness of this show. Getting caught up in the complexities of the show or trying to hang onto every little word is pointless. This is not really an anime that you need to hit the rewind/pause button in an effort to understand what is going on when something \"complex\" is being said. Just give your brain a rest, relax, and let Gurren Lagann take care of the rest. I usually do not use words such as \"epic/epicness\" or \"badassery\" when describing a show but these are the first words that come to mind when I think of Gurren Lagann. This show is also , IMO, the epitome of a shounen.  It's testosterone-crazed main characters, epic galaxy-sized mecha fights, memorable bad ass quotes, and the \"never give up\" attitude perfectly defines a shounen.\nAnyways this anime will always be a favorite of mine and I highly recommend it to everyone. Mainly guys though. Lol. This was my first review so I hope everything seemed concise and organized and not so much like I was rambling."},

Although I like art style with a more mature feel to it and am not really a fan of mecha animes, there are three artistic aspects this anime is probably one of the best at. \n1) Humongous super epic battles..things get more and more massive, and just as you think, you can't get bigger than that, they prove you wrong...time and time and time again. The scale of actions in this anime is truly second to none. \n2)Explosions- there are only so many ways you can make explosions interesting...TTGL probably used every artistic tool out there to make explosions look just plain beautiful and interesting.\n3)Superpowers-every time you think they're done for, they'll pull out a new totally unrealistic but nonetheless super amazingly awesome superpower and kick everybody's ass...well almost every time...but no spoilers...you'll have to see it yourself to be surprised.\nCharacter design as well as some parts do lack animation though...I heard 40% of TTGL's humongous budget was spent on a few last episodes that are absolutely gorgeous, but some episodes are just good, about hald are masterpiecelike a quarter very good and a quarter good ones(judging by art quality only. Characters seem unpolished and whether it was meant that way or not that was one thing I was unhappy about.\nSound 9/10:\nAmazing explosions, great theme song great voice acting, overall flawless sounds. 9/10 because I don't give 10 for something less that outstanding, and masterpiece like(which would require being perfect + something fresh/unusual) But you should now that I have the soundtrack on my phone and periodically listen to it....raw raw fight the power!\nCharacter 9/10:\nBeautiful...you have the teenage boy, learning to be a man, you have single most manly man in history, a cool and sexy female sniper and a lot of trustworthy friends you can entrust your life to. The aspects that made this anime great were the contrast between the Kamina with his unbreakable optimism, mabliness and later revealed weaknesses and the weak, normal, anti-hero like Simon, who hopes to one day be like Kamina. There is also the pragmatic no it all, that does the most rational thing with best intentions, but in the world of TTGL its THE FIGHTING SPIRITT that decides it all. (you'll understand me after you watch the anime)\nAgain for such a great anime, the character design used was such a shame...so I'll take one point away here too...\nEnjoyment 10/10\nThe whole thing...is definition of the word epic. By the end of the anime, you'll love all the characters(or almost all) even the villains.\nI loved it.\nOverall 10/10:\nDefinitely a masterpiece. I'd even give it the rare 11/10 if it wasn't for the crappy character design.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    bratty, hyper-active shounen show about a group of humans using their spirit power or whatever to overcome any and all obstacles. The humans are forced to live underground thanks to some unknown force, but our young heroes manage to break out almost immediately, and not only that, form a sort of ragtag rebellion just in the first few episodes. The series' strengths rely solely on making you turn off your brain and marvel at how badass everything is. It mostly works.\nImaishi brings his chaotic, energetic style (Dead Leaves) under control for most of it, but unleashes everything he has during the battle scenes. Compositions are\n          \n        frequently dynamic and aim to bring out the often ridiculously exhilarating nature of the mecha fights. In Gurren Lagann, nothing is subtle, and as such, its animation and composition follow suit. There is no logical progression to any of the battles. Everything is predetermined. Because our characters have \"spirit,\" whereas our villains don't, everything is resolved thru yelling loudly and \"feeling\" things more than the opponent does. It isn't a drawback of the series, though; it's more like a philosophical viewpoint. Because to be human is to be reckless, emotional, ever-changing.\nHad some other notes about the first few episodes being a secret remake of FLCL (with the drills, erections, boobs and teenage confusion), but it only extended to the first few episodes, so I didn't bother thinking more about it. Although, as a Gainax show, it's playing around with the mecha formula, but this time taking it to different, more operatic heights.\ncopied/pasted from my blog: thenextthingblog.wordpress.com\n        "},

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is absolutely obnoxious. It is the definition of over-the-top. At the start, it comes across as downright stupid. So, how has this anime won over the hearts of so many? All the reasons I just listed; it draws you into the ridiculousness that it is. \nThe Story (9/10) is absolutely great - fantastic, really. The first 7 episodes aside, the over-the-top style gets progressively MORE over-the-top over time, a difficult (or near impossible) thing to get away\n          \n        with without near-perfect pacing thereof, which Gurren Lagann delivers flawlessly. \nThe Art (8/10) is nothing all that special, though it does have its own unique style, just like the rest of the show. Personally, I wasn't all that impressed by it, but I found nothing wrong with it either. \nThe Sound (10/10) is brilliant. The voice acting in both the original Japanese and the English dub are fantastic. The soundtrack is an absolute gem - no other series could pull off opera fused with rap, but there it is near the end of Gurren Lagann; the soundtrack was so good I was left grinning from ear to ear like an idiot in the middle of several episodes near the end. The music may seem repetitive at first, as the same thematic material is used throughout the entire 27 episodes, but the impact of these themes, as with most of the show, gets better and better as you approach the end.\nAs for Enjoyment (11/10), I cannot begin to describe (or understand why, for that matter) how enjoyable Gurren Lagann is. It draws you in like a cult and builds itself up in the eyes of the watcher exponentially. \nTo be perfectly frank (and cheesy) this anime is about feeling - by the time you get to episode 20, you feel the NEED to keep watching - what originally seemed over-the-top (and still is, in hindsight) is absolutely enrapturing. Say what you will, but this anime is easily one the most entertaining ever aired. Be warned, you may hate the first few episodes; I myself had a hard time getting through the first 8 episodes. From there on, however, it really does get good quickly. The story of the man whose drill will pierce the heavens is a great one - don't miss out. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Seeing this anime on the top of the list rated number 1 made me watch it just to find out what people considered number 1. After I finished the series I was confused by its placement because I consider many anime such as Hajime no Ippo, Monster, and Paprika to be better. While I do not think it is number 1 it is still a worthwhile anime to watch.\n     The best part of this series is easily the characters and the art design that immediately draw you in and keep you wanting more. The story is somewhat lacking to me with\n          \n        a reoccurring theme that begins to get very annoying and repetitive during the final episodes. But the overall theme is something that can relate to everyone and that is, \"changing fate\". So this anime has a wide fan base.\n     So overall if you are looking for the number 1 anime look elsewhere because that is not what you will find. But do not let that stop you from watching this anime, it has some of the most memorable characters and overall is good. Just gets a little annoying at the end.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This will not be a college essay,but i tried my dam hardest to write something fairly long and deep in order to satisfy the need for something longer. its still a bit short compared to most other hella long deep reviews, but you end up losing people if theyre too long.  Time to start the epic.\nThis anime just oozes epic.  When the main song comes on \"FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT THE POWA\" you just get these chills and know someone is getting their ass kicked today.  \nThe Story:  I was actually really impressed with the story.  Its very inspiring.  The\n          \n        story is essentially about humanity being oppressed in some way and trying to break their constraints in order to decide their own destiny and just kick some enemy ass. Im going to stay away from the characters in this part because I'll talk about them later.  The Story has two parts and not to spoil anything for you, all im going to say is that there is a before and after.  The story will make you laugh, cry, get excited, and just not believe what just happened.    \nCharacters:  This is probably one of the main draws to this anime.  Kamina is the definition of man.  Beats everyone up, never backs down, and hes just manly.  Simon is the complete opposite and hes a pussy (he soon becomes much more manly later on) and the two different personalities work together very well.  Then there is Yoko.  In every epic space opera there always has to be a hot babe.  Shes not just for the looks and has an interesting back story and serves the plot well in how she physiologically affects the other characters.  But honestly do I care that much?  HELL No, shes just one hot babe that can bring a can of whoop ass to any party.  There are characters that you will love and some that you hate, such as Rossiou (he turns into a little bitch).\nThe Art:  Cant really say much about the art because im not some art connoisseur, but it does look pretty.  Its easy on the eyes and it looks good and thats awesome in my book.  \nEnjoyment:  FUCK YEA!!!  Excuse my language, but that's the only way i can express my enjoyment for this anime.  As i did say before you will orgasm or at least feel some chills at the tip of your hairs from this.  This anime just keeps on getting bigger and bigger.  You start out small and you always want to see how they can top it.  the mechs get bigger the action gets more intense the stakes are always higher.  Once they started throwing galaxies at each other i was just floored.  \nThe Sound:  There is a really good sound track in this anime and i enjoyed nearly all of them.  The main thing that stuck with me was the fight the powa rap/opera/classical/action packed song.  It always just inspired me and gave me the sense that there was still hope in this hopeless battle for humanity.  YES IT IS THAT DEEP.  Also the dubs were excellent for this dub.  Kamina, Simon, Rossiou, Yoko, and Lord Genome, even the anti spiral had some of the best voice acting that i have heard in a long time.  \nSPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!! (not that many)  SPOILER  SPOILER SPOILER\nVillains:  I just had to add this section in.  I just loved the villains as they were some of the manliest villains in the world.  What i found interesting is that no one ever truthfully felt as if they were a bad guy, but that they were killing people for the betterment of the universe.  Lord Genome and the Anti-spiral are just some of the coolest villains in the world.  They think that they are helping humanity by killing humanity, but its just so satisfying seeing the battles between them.  \nSPOILER END SPOILER END SPOILER END SPOILER END. \nOverall this anime was a gem hidden underneath all the stones.  I loved nearly every facet of this anime and when it was all over i was a bit sad that the fight for humanity was over.  This anime defined being a man for me and you cannot truly become a man or a woMAN until you watch and enjoy this anime.  \n        "},

Yours is the drill that will pierce through heavens!!\"\nThis anime is something truly unique, you dont see anime like this alot, and for some it may seem to much of old school to watch, after all you got main characters that Don't take SHIT! They make a stand up to the enemy,  scream with all they might and bravado, and though they get hurt, and might die, giving up is not a option, even if covered in fear, they laugh at the fearsome, and break through (most of the times overdoing it all the way!! xD), so\n          \n        they can create a path, for those that follow, a path for a better tomorrow!! \nMost anime are the opposite of the realistic, but this series, it picks up the laws of the universe and reinventats them for they own will of survival. Impossible will become possible on Gurren Lagann, and OVERKILL is a word that as never as before I associated a to a anime. Some may be disconected from the anime after reading the sypnosis, because they wont take the show seriously... a silly one they may think, WRONG, this is one hell of a ride, ignore common sense, and see the impossible happening!! You will love this show, certainly itself, it overdoes things, but that in Tegen Toppa Gurren Lagann, is EPIC, EMOTIONAL, FULL OF LIFE and it is very well done, where others may fail, the anime prevails and kicks the curb, the boundary to levels I never have seen, overdoing it marvelously!! ROW!! ROW!! Fight the POWA!! (aka POWER!!)\nSTORY: Itself the story may not seem too deep at first, humanity is locked underground and the series is initially about they struggle to reclaim surface from the Spiral King, being this only half of the story (that itself has much more meaning and detail to it), it doesnt stop anywhere there, and keeps suprising you with twists and epic quests!! And in the end when you look back and you see how far everything as come to, you realise the show was aiming for much more than what you first thought it was. Also the story may have its cliches, but they were all well done, to the point of feeling something new.\nART:Animation, scenarios, characters design, everything is outstandingly done, there may be something that maybe a bit less in quality, if there is, I never noticed since the pros were so many and well done.\nThe fighting scenes are so fluid and vibrating, the colours used especially on the transformations and special effects stuff, are great, and the anime itself has lots of background and scenarios that are beautfill, and sometimes sad, but noneless a joy to watch, it will beautiful set pieces, like being so high in the sky that you can see both the sun lowering and the moon rising. Some of the stuff that happens at screen, explosions, fights, really shames other anime and even movies, that came after, and we are talking about a anime from 2007, for what they done at the time, I was pleasently suprised and couldnt take my attention away of the screen!\nSOUND: Brilliant!! The anime makes the viewer experiencing many and varied, different kind of emotion situations: loss, finding of yourself, fear, sadness, despair, joy, laughlable moments, love, friendship and power of will, will to change the reality, to bend the curve, and accomplish impossible goals against the odds! The OST of the anime covers every one of these situations, with great quality and detail, being musics like \"Libera me\" From Hell and other great ones, some of my favorites (and I have already listened to many different great anime OST) ! \nAlso every bit of sound is placed right, when the moment demands it, and it all helps to give more meaning and immersion to everything you experience.\nCHARACTERS: Kamina, Simon, Nia, Lordgenome, Viral, Yoko, Kittan and many others. Itself it is full of great characters that have more deep than what it initially shows up. The reason for the anime being so damm good, is the characters themselves that are the support, of what the anime is built into, it is their stories and hardships their surpass, their fates, that gives a path for everything that I meantionated before about the anime to take place. Lots of different personas, Kamina, the Bravado, that finds the strength to endure and go forth on Simon that initially is shy and unsecure, and unware of his own potential, which latter growns ups to something BADASS, and more I wont say.\nPutting it \"on the naked\" you see this show for its characters, and you scream, cry and have good times, thanks to them. And there will be alot of those great moments!!\nOVERALL: Through willpower, power of believing and of kept on going on, a grand journey waits those that give it a try to this masterpiece of creativity production. Every aspect of the show, I love and held in high regards, comedy, drama, action and romance, from start tp finish, it just keeps pushing and pushing to new heights, it never gets boring, there is always something interesting happening, from beggining to the end, never a let down moment. At first it may seem that something wasnt done well, or that, that thing shouldnt had happen. But it had to reach to the finale, \"No pain, no gain\"!, every aventure has its costs. Even with this said, the anime manages to be very colourfull and not so dark as some others, but the sadness and pain, are there, it is all a pattern of life, and you should go and make use of the opportunities others gave you to dig your way out of the darkness to a better light, to a better destiny. People come and go, and create a cycle of paths and changes, that we should take on, and use, to create paths for those that are to came, to walk through.\nI highly reccomend anyone to give the anime a try, and prepare yourself, maybe there are only 27 episodes, but compared to many other anime longer and shorter, it does things they never done with 27 episodes, or will do with whole seasons! A classic.\nThis is a story of a quest, for hope of a better future, a adventure of meanings, of feelings, of emotions, manliness, of unbreakable souls and desires, and in the end, you will have characters that you will never forget, for the rest of your life, because you were there, when everything seemed impossible, and in the end, even the universe was possible!\nA masterpiece of its own genre, and one of the best anime I watched in my life!\nThis is TENGEN TOPPA, THIS IS GURREN LAGANN!!!!!!

The sounds were pretty damn amazing although their are some parts where it sounds like WTF was that it was still alright. The characters were awesome each one of them  has their own role and the story also focuses on some characters not just Simon. THE STORY plot WAS one of the most amazing I've seen. Sure the story might seem dumb at first but if you actually take the time to know it and enjoy it a little then next thing you know you'll be on the last episode.

Anything I say will not do this show justice, but I will try my best.\nGurren Lagann is a very personal experience. It is about emotion, drive, and passion. It elevates itself to the point that certain moments in the show are nothing more than pure unadultered emotion flowing out of your television or computer screens. But Gurren Lagann is more than just a damn fine super robot show. It is way more.\nWhat attracted me to Gurren Lagann, more than anything, was the premise, and the true love between the characters. A small digger, underground,\n          \n        is inspired by his \"spiritual brother\", an outspoken and radical man who follows his passion, however insane it is. The rest is an amazing coming of age story, filled with moments to laugh about, moments to jump out of your seats, and moments that fill your heart up with a bittersweet feeling. You can shed tears over a moment and remember it two years later (which I have).\nYou can notice the subtle things in the show that let you know that it was more than just a money grub. Things like how the track that plays while Simon is first digging is left unfinished at around the 2:10 minute mark, and is then continued and completed in the 26th episode, in the culmination of Simon's character development, in a very deep and reflective scene. There are many, many, many, other things like this.\nI could tell you that the art is absolutely spectacular (especially when it reverts to comic-book style art at the most powerful moments), how the main theme is in my opinion the greatest and most inspiring song ever created, how all of the characters are awesome as hell, and how the story has twists and turns that you won't believe- but I won't. I'd rather tell you that Gurren Lagann, personally, for me, showed me the meaning of life. The search of heart, the search to be free- the search of inspiration. Gurren Lagann is about going above the impossible, forgetting statistics, and following that stupid voice in your heart, no matter how helpless things get. And if things get worse, you keep going. If they get worse after, you still keep going. And even if after all that you're sitting in a jail cell while the earth leaves without you, you're damn sure you keep going after that.\nThis is the greatest show I have ever seen, and it has changed the way I see the world. Don't believe me? \nJust who the hell do you think I am? \n        "},

It's basicly an insperational storyline. It's beautiful. Some people may be turned off mainly due the fact that it's a mech anime. But trust me, the mech thing is not the most major thing about this series, it's the story. The story goes through a timeskip during midway, which isn't a big spoiler but it does change the tone to the series. It goes from a journey to defeat the Anti Spirals to well...you'll find out when you\n          \n        see it. It has a unique charm to it with it's characters, some of which get MAJOR character developments. Mainly the main character, Simon.\nOverall: 9/10\nArt: The art is great, with the exception of episode 4, it has fantastic art all the way through. Especially the last episode. The character designs are fantastic and so are the mech's(although King Kittan looks like a robotic banana). They really put effort into the art.\nOverall: 8/10\nSound: Music- The music is pretty good. Some of the songs like \"Sorairo Days\" the opening theme which is very energetic. \"Row, Row Fight the Power\" I believe comes later on in the series in some of the more serious scenes and is also pretty darn awesome. Overall it suits the theme of the show.\nVoices- Sub: I haven't seen the japanese dub alot. But from what I've heard so far it's pretty good. Didn't like some of the voices but those are just a few nitpicks. It's ok I guess\nDub- I've seen the entire series dubbed and it's EPIC. Yuri Lowenthal was great as Simon espicially during episodes 11-15. Tony Oliver did great as adult Simon too. Kyle Hebert was a voice some people thought was bad, I thought it was pretty good. overall it was good. \nOverall- 7/10\nCharacter- I'm guessing this means how much I enjoyed the characters. The character development was brilliant for Simon. He's the character that's grows the most throughout the series. Especially after episode 11 or so. Not gonna say much about this though.\nOverall: 8/10\nPros: Great music,art and character development, superb voice acting and one of the few series to get a timeskip right.\nCons: Too short :P Stretches the fanservice XD \n        "},

But here I am, and I can proudly say that Lagann is probably the most well written, well thought out, and just plain enjoyable thing I've watched since Cowboy Bebop so many years back. \nSTORY AND CHARACTERS\nWhere so many anime fail is managing to have a great story and ALSO a great cast (see Attack on Titan). It seems like it's always one or the other, which is unfortunate. However, Gurren Lagann blows it's way into the\n          \n        anime medium with a cool and exciting premise, as well as one of the best and most varied cast of characters I've seen. What makes these characters special in my opinion is how they change over the course of the series, Simon in particular. Gurren Lagann is a story about moving forward, evolving, doing what you never thought possible the moment before, and this is reflected perfectly by the fantastic character development. Every scenario Team Gurren faces helps to shape Simon's character, and change him away from the shy coward he is it at first, into more and more of a bad ass. It's simply amazing to watch as the show and its characters change so much over the course of its 27 episode run. Many dislike the changes made in the second half, as things get a lot more serious then they were before, (and arguably more boring) but I personally found GL to be 100% pure entertainment from beginning to end. \nThe enjoyment levels of this show is off the charts. That is, if you find huge and ridiculous looking robots beating the crap out of each other in the most creative and crazy ways possible entertaining. If you don't, you might want to try to avoid Gurren Lagann. Yes, at the heart of all this great character development and awesome story, is a whole lot of dumb. A WHOLE lot of dumb. That's only if you want to call it dumb though (I personally prefer the term \"Crazy Awesome\"). There is very little about GL that doesn't have some other significant point. This makes it rather hard for me to find a flaw in this series. Every time I think I've found one, I realize that the creators seem to have done it on purpose just to prove a point, and I can't fault them for that.\nFor example, I could complain about the rampant fan-service in the early bits of the series, but it's so blatant that it almost seems like the creators were parodying other shows for there ridiculous fan-service, especially since it fades to a point of barley being noticeable rather quickly. I could also say that the more serious bits of the series later on were not as enjoyable as the   \nearlier episodes. But yet again, it's as if they intentionally made these episodes slower so that they could come back later and show how much more entertaining crazy epic action is then the political drama (and my God, they do.). \nSOUND\nIf there was one thing about GL that wasn't amazing, it would probably be the soundtrack. That's not saying much though, as the music is far from bad. There are a few tracks that really do stand out, but as a whole the soundtrack wasn't too much to talk about. The english dub on the other hand, was excellent. Every character was portrayed perfectly, and they really bring life into these rather deep and likable characters. If you prefer to watched dubbed, this one has my absolute recommendation. \nART\nIt also goes without saying that Gurren Lagann looks fantastic. The large scale mech battles are the core of the  series, and the only fault I can find in the animation is the entirety of episode 4 (you'll know why when you see it) Other than that, I can't think of any place in particular where it seemed Gainax cheaped out of making it look absolutely extraordinary. What I like about the action side of GL is how it takes the mech genre and does something new with it. Yes, Gurren Lagann is a mech show, but it's so much more than just boring looking robots shooting each other. Most of the battles actually involve melee combat more than ranged weaponry, which keeps a personal feel to the encounters. And boy, are there some crazy encounters.\nOVERALL\nGurren Lagann is a difficult show give a proper recommendation, due to how drastically things change as the series goes on. If you don't like the ridiculous over the top stupidness of the first half, you still may enjoy the more serious and emotional second half, or vice versa. All I can say is watch it, you will either love it, or hate it. I don't think there can be an in-between for Gurren Lagann. But as for me? I loved the hell out of it. \n9.5 out of 10 \n        "},

Everything about it was phenomenal. Very few animes draw you in on such a level. The story and characters are, in my opinion, its best aspect.\nThe story is very different, combining mechs, comedy, a post-apocalyptic feel, romance, action... it is so diverse. The sense of personality that each of the characters had gave me a connection to them. They felt so real, and I genuinely cared about what happened to them.\nI also love the art style! I know it has older animations; however, it is unique and fits everything\n          \n        else wonderfully. The action scenes flow well. The only complaint I could see is if someone prefers sharper animations. But if you are open to any style, this is wonderful. \nThe lessons Gurren Lagann teaches you... are beyond beautiful. It teaches you to believe in yourself, keep fighting no matter what, always have hope, and about the bond between friends and brothers. If you have not seen it, I highly recommend it. After seeing Gurren Lagann, I can say without a doubt: This is a masterpiece.\n        "},

It's actually hard not to see it as a parody of epic mecha action, at least on some level, but is works well on it's own merits.\nI was surprised at how deep the backstory was. It's certainly no Evangelion, but at it's core there are interesting philosophical questions about human nature and ambition. The more\n          \n        surfacebound storyline is a beast that builds and builds, and I'm blown away by how Gainax managed to fit it all in 27 episodes, together with all the action and character development (yes, there is even some of that).\nAll in all, a very good anime. Over the top and über-epic, but quite intelligent, and very funny to boot.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Gurren lagann, and anime that is infamous for it's over the top fights and manliness. An anime that is also deeply rooted in a lot of people lives, mine included. This anime is one of a kind and there will never be anything ever like it again, which is awesome while also being depressing. But why is it like this? What makes it the masterpiece that it is and how come there isn't anything else out there like this? That's what a true masterpiece is. It is something that can't be re-created, something that is etched in time itself. This is an anime that will\n          \n        be talked about and always be watched by people for many many years to come. I will keep anything remotely spoilery out of this review since this anime is special to me and I want anyone that reads this to enjoy it to it's fullest capacity.\n\nStory- The story in gurren lagann is an evolving one. One where the main goal is always changing and therefore the overall plot is pretty much non-existent. It's about a small group of people, Kamina, Simon, and Yoko with very important side characters being Kittan, Rossiou, Viral and lord genome. There is a main villain that later establishes itself, but I won't spoil who. The way Gurren Lagann tells it's story would best be described as \"it gets bigger every episode\". It's hard to explain, but it feels like every new episode tries to top the last episode making something bigger and more manly happen. Now this escalates beyond what any anime, movie, or piece of any fiction has ever done before or will ever do. It's a very simple concept, yet nobody has really done it to this extent before. This isn't to the detriment of character development or story-telling though, which is the awesome thing. There is more conversation and character development happening than there is fighting, at least early in the story. The other awesome thing is that a lot of the character development and story telling happens during some of these fights.\n      The story does have many, many plots twists, character deaths, points of weakness and also points of happiness in it. It is definitely an emotional roller coaster. Just because this is an anime that you should kind of turn your brain off in order enjoy doesn't mean that you don't feel for or get attached to any of these characters though. There are some very hard deaths to accept that happen in gurren lagann, some that don't seem real. Some that just seem out of place, but maybe that was point? Not everyone is as they may always seem. Gurren Lagann does things that most conventional anime are afraid to do. It has real plot twists that happen, not stuff that is believable or stuff that you could ever really see coming and that is why this anime seems fresh despite being an older anime. It doesn't follow any path, it carves it's own path and basically says fuck it, which is a good thing. There isn't enough originality out there anymore and Gurren Lagann is definitely original in every single category, including it's story.\nArt- The art style of Gurren Lagann is epic. It has awesome looking mechs, very well animated and well drawn for it's time and it just bleeds originality. The animation holds up even today, hell it looks better than some anime that have come out recently. It's an anime that you can easily go back and watch and it won't seem old or worn out. \nSound- The intro and the battle music....Gurren Lagann is infamous for two things. One being it's over the top fight scenes and the other one being FIGHT THE POWAH! It has quite possibly one of the catchiest and most empowering battle-tracks in existence. Anyone that has watched Gurren Lagann would tell you the same. The song \"Libera me From Hell\" has got to be one of the most well orchestrated music pieces ever made. I would tell you to go and listen to it but it would be better to hear it in the anime first. It's so fitting and the funny thing is that it's a mix of opera and rap, both of which I usually don't like and really despise and yet libera me from hell is one of my favorite songs of all time period. Now, libera me from hell is one track that is amazing, but what about the intro and outro? Well they're also very well done and awesome. Both are very fitting and equally as catchy, right up there with libera me from hell. \n\nCharacter- I already partly mentioned this in the story section but, all of the characters both main and supporting and extremely well done. Some of them might fit into certain tropes, but they all do something different or irregular to separate themselves from that trope. Kamina for example is your standard ultimate badass, but he's also a very caring older brother to Simon, one who talks to him on the same level and also tries to guide him on the right path and cheer him up. That is just one example, Yoko is kinda like the fanservice of the show, but she's far more than just fanservice material. Sure she's sexy, but she's also a pivotal part of team dai-gurren. No spoilers but, she does help Kamina and Simon out in a big way. All of the characters are like this in some way, they're all very well thought out and realized. Now, the character progression. The character progression in Gurren Lagann is very good as previously stated, but why is that? Well the characters are realistic. Yes they may fight against overwhelming odds sometimes and truly do the impossible, but that doesn't that they aren't scared or nervous about doing that. They show emotion while doing everything and not only that but they learn from their mistakes and grow as characters and they are always growing even until the very end. The characters are what make the show in Gurren Lagann.\nEnjoyment- This anime was made for 100% enjoyment, if you're a goddamn man that is. It's over the top, has very, very enjoyable fight scenes and even though it focuses on these it might also teach you something by the time you finish, I definitely know it taught me something. If you enjoy any kind of fighting or action then you'll enjoy the hell out of  this, but you'll also enjoy it if you enjoy seeing character growth or want an over the top story that is also well told and realized. It's a very enjoyable anime and is definitely one of the best if not the best in it's category.\nOverall- Overall I think you get where i'm going with this. Among all of the so called masterpieces and 10's people give out this is a true 10 and a true masterpiece hands down. I'm not one to argue on the internet, I actually hate it, but i'll defend the legitimacy of gurren lagann as a masterpiece until the day that I die. It changed my life for the better and if it wasn't for gurren lagann I don't even know if I would be where i'm at right now. It gave me the power to fight, not other people, but life. I won't go into detail but my life is shit right now. Has been for a while and the memories I have of watching gurren lagann a year or so back still ring so strongly in my head it feels just like yesterday. It's very enjoyable and well made it just might also change your life for the better. If my opinion alone isn't good enough just ask anyone else that has watched it, they'll tell you the same. \n    Now this is for anyone else that wants to read it, the review is pretty much over, but I feel like writing this right now since it is kind of fitting. I want to talk about the feeling anime gives you. Everyone has experienced this at some point while watching anime, hopefully at least. The best way of describing this feeling would as a high or sort of euphoria I guess. Gurren Lagann gave me this ten times over by the end. It takes a lot for something to truly change someones entire life style. To put it kinda shortly, i'm a shut in, I use to hate the outside world, never wanted a job, never wanted to ever get out there, use to even be afraid of being outside in general, but gurren lagann changed that. Something about the way gurren lagann most have done it or said it made me realize that I was wasting away my life and that i needed to fight back against myself and at least believe in the me my parents believed in. It might sound silly, but it got someone that lived in a basement for many years to finally get a job, and one that requires me to be around many, many people at that. Gurren Lagann might seem a but childish to some people, but it has some strong messages in it and I hope that some people like my review enough to go and watch it and hopefully it influences their life in a positive way. That's all I have to say about gurren lagann really. No words could ever truly explain how amazing gurren lagann. Watching Gurren Lagann isn't like watching a normal anime, it's more like an entire experience. Like traversing the woods at day break, feeling the cool breeze on your skin, hearing animals fluttering about. That is an experience to me and that is what gurren lagann gave me. Now go out there and experience everything gurren lagann has to offer. "},

Even though this may be a \"refraining factor\" or in reason to not complete it, I can assure that the results of the show are beneficial towards its theme and story.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a show in a league of its own. However, I suppose that I should explain my reasoning behind this statement. Before reading below, please be aware that this will contain some spoilers for the whole show (I'm trying, but I can't truly express my feelings towards this show without discussing events in later episodes), and should be read at your own discretion, though I advise against it. You should watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann in its entirety simply due to the fact that it is a masterpiece before reading this review, or for that matter, any other reviews, articles, or\n          \n        otherwise on this show.\nThe story of Tengen Toppa Gurenn Lagann is a relatively simple one. It is arguably the most unfiltered example of the Hero's Journey that defines other stories and shows from Homer's The Odyssey and the myths of Heracles to Code Geass (2006) and Boku No Hero Academia (2016). The show stars Simon, a young digger, and his quest throughout his life to save the world. This is a relatively easy to grasp concept, but is executed to the best of the ability of Studio Gainax and director Hiroyuki Imayishi. The story is extremely clean, clear, and concise, there is very little confusion within the plot, and the ending ties up everything extremely well, leaving nothing else to be desired.\nThe art is absolutely stellar. The animation is consistently amazing throughout the series, whether the setting is in the dim darkness of the underground caves, New Kamina City, or the universal stage of the fight against the Anti-Spiral. All of the characters look unique and powerful, and they all move cleanly. I have to give extra praise to the fight scenes, particularly the fight between Viral and Kamina in the beginning. Everything is choreographed perfectly, and we are made to feel the epicness of every fight that happens.\nThe music does exactly what it needs to. There was no moment in the series where the music felt out of place or unnecessary. However, I was never particularly knocked off my feet by stellar sound design like that of Death Parade. I have absolutely no problems with the sound, but I have no outstanding praise for it either.\nIt's truly a shame that the scores only go up to ten, because if I could have scored higher for both characters and enjoyment, I would have. The characters are undeniably the best part of Gurren Lagann. In particular, the characters of Simon, Kamina, and Viral deserve to be immortalized. All of the characters undergo transformations that not only befit their roles in the story and their personalities, but also seem very real and human. For instance, Rossiu's change between the large timeskip seems believable, and is probably a transformation that many responsible government or high-management officials undergo throughout their careers. Finally, the ending scene expresses the final side of Simon, who has become a man weary of all of the stress of life and tragedy after losing both Nia and Kamina during his life, and just wants to be left alone. It rounds out one of the most complete characterizations of a character that exists, and is amazing for it.\nFinally, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is just extremely fun to watch. There isn't anything complicated behind this reasoning. All there is is the fact that all of these aspects combined lead to an extremely enjoyable viewing experience. The characters have extremely good chemistry and the dialog is well-written and always feels believable for the character. The action scenes are monumental, and the epic final fight between the combined Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and the Anti-Spiral just oozes scale. It gives the impression that everything really is at stake, and sucks us all into every swing.\nIn conclusion, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is nothing short of a masterpiece. I have seen no other show be as successful attempting anything even remotely similar to this one, and I tend to enjoy, or at the very least appreciate, pretty much everything I watch (I do currently have an average rating score of around 8.5/10 at the time of writing). My overall score for Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is 10/10, and it is a true shame that the system won't let me tack on another 5 points. Everybody needs to watch this masterpiece. I sure as hell didn't regret any minute I spent with the show, and I hope nobody reading this review regrets their time with it either.\n        "},

Being from Gainax, sometimes logic is just kicked out to the curb.  This is a good thing, though, as it is something that Kamina tells Simon to do anyway.  This sense of not caring much about how things would actually function also fits the art and sound.  The art is done in such a unique and interesting way.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    So. Gurren Lagann. Gurren Lagann is a bit of a mixed bag in my opinion. While when it's good, it's really, really good, when it's bad, it's equally so. At its best, it's a show about believing in yourself and being the most epic thing you will ever watch. At its worst, its a show with a generic concept and a worn-out formula\nStory: 6/10\nThis is not a complex story with a ton of hidden messages. It doesn't have a \"deeper\" meaning. It says what it wants to say and does it well. Other than its messages of perseverance, determination, and growing up,  it's just\n          \n        meant to be is a fun, balls to the wall, insane, 26 episode thrill ride. And when it sticks to that, the show works beautifully. Unfortunately, it kinda forgets that halfway through. And at this point, the show's stupidity becomes painfully obvious. Because none of one character's actions make sense here. in any way. \nHowever, the show gets back on track quickly, only having a couple of episodes of angst and idiocy, although it does feel like an eternity. After that is when it truly shines IMO. \nArt: 8/10 \nThe show doesn't have the greatest art, at least by today's standards. However, it does have a certain charm to it that makes it endearing. The mechas are ridiculous, a few of the characters more so, and it's all fine and dandy, episode 4 nonwithstanding. (I think it was episode 4 at least) The colors are nice, the animation flows nicely, and the show just looks good.\nThe fight scenes are something else entirely. They're gorgeous to watch, full of different colors and weapons. They're always epic, and kudos to Gainax for making them work that well.\nSound: 7/10\nNow, the soundtrack is pretty good. during epic scenes, the soundtrack has a suitable level of epicness, while it's subtle enough during the show's few quiet moments. \nThe one opening the show gets is filled with hype. it gets you pumped up for the show, and sounds good doing it.\nThe dub and sub are pretty much on par. While I do like the familiarity and understandability of the english voices, the Japanese ones do a more than excellent job themselves.\nCharacter: 8/10\nOne of my favorite anime characters, Kamina is the self-proclaimed manliest of men. He's loud, arrogant, and full of himself. At least, that's what he'd like everyone to think.\nSimon starts out as shy, merely following his \"bro\"'s lead. But he quickly matures, and by the end of the series he's just as awesome as Kamina, which is very clearly intentional, given how his design changes.\nYoko is the final main character, and while she starts out as apparently just a way to deliver fanservice, she develops a lot over the course of the series, and ends up being a pretty well-rounded character.\nThe supporting cast is great too, ranging from the flamboyant Leeron to the adorable mole-pig whose name escapes me.\nThe one exception is Rossiu. I cannot stand this character. none of his actions make sense in any way, and I can't see how he gets the kind of support he attains in the series. \nEnjoyment: 10/10\nWhat Gurren Lagann lacks in depth, it more than makes up for in sheer ridiculousness. The fight sequences are superb, and, that hiccup in the middle aside, it's always a pleasure to watch.  I've watched the series twice as of this review, and have full intent to go through several more times before I die, which hopefully shouldn't be for quite a long time.\nOverall: 10/10\nGurren Lagann is not the best anime out there. Nor is it the most complex. It is however, the most badass thing you'll ever watch. It's incredible when it's good, but it can be frustratingly stupid when it's bad. Luckily the latter is short-lived. \nGurren Lagann, spin on!\n        "},

As someone who's watched his fair share, I'd say it deserves a lot of the praise it gets if I'm being completely honest.\nGurren Lagann wouldn't have nearly as much of a special place in my heart were it not for a good friend of mine who recommended it to me back in early 2009, but I couldn't access the show at the time (I refuse to subscribe to Netflix and I had no idea it aired on SyFy). This guy was one of my best friends and\n          \n        would go on and on about how I'd love the series, and I've been unable to contact him for the past few years, so going back to finally watch it in early 2015 held even more meaning to me.\nAaanyways, let's look at the individual categories seeing as how they're listed above.\nStory: Don't worry, I won't spoil anything too pertinent. Gurren Lagann follows the story of soul-brothers Simon \"the Digger\" and Kamina. The story does start off somewhat slow and even when it first starts to pick up, it relies more on character development and interaction than the actual things going on, but if you know anything about Gainax, you know you're in for some mind-blowing twists and unique story elements if you stick around long enough. I've said too much already!\nArt: At first, the show seems pretty standard fare for an anime, but the artwork is well done nonetheless. Aside from a certain infamous episode that almost brings the likes of ATHF to mind, the animation is overall solid. One thing I like about it is how lively the animation is! The characters are very expressive and something is always moving onscreen. I feel this is refreshing because a lot of modern anime and western animation feels very \"static\", if you get me. The pre-commercial eyecatches are somewhat famous for their unique artwork. Visuals get pretty crazy during fight scenes and I absolutely love it.\nSound: Let me get this out of the way; I am in no way a sub-elitist. I prefer dubs, sorry. That being said, this show's English dub is one of the best I've ever heard. This show features an all-star voice cast with the likes of Kyle Hebert (Son Gohan, Ryu) and Yuri Lowenthal (Sasuke Uchiha) as the main duo of Kamina and Simon, as well as Michelle Ruff (Rukia) as Yoko, among many others such as Johnny Yong Bosch (Ichigo Kurosaki). The music is another strong point. While I find the opening theme \"Sorario Days\" to be more or less a generic anime opening song, themes such as \"Happily Ever After\" (which only plays twice in the whole show and I think should've been the opening instead), \"Ten Wo Tsuke\", and \"With Your Drill...\" have stuck with me consistently. Of course, I couldn't talk about music in this show without mentioning the famous track \"Rap Is A Man's Soul!\" This is something you've probably heard of even if you've never heard of this show thanks to its widely quoted hook of \"Do the impossible, see the invisible, ROW, ROW, FIGHT THE POWER!\" The song itself is performed by Japanese rapper Tarantula and features a catchy beat and lyrics that reflect the theme of the show well.\nCharacter: This show's characters are one of its main strong points. Everyone is incredibly well-defined and three-dimensional. I won't describe them any further because it's better to get to know them yourself. Everyone's interactions are entertaining and realistic, and seeing the characters team up for an attack or something is a great time. My personal favorite character was that of Adiane, with her lively animation, unique design (an anime girl that doesn't look like a twig? Whoa!), reckless personality, and phenomenal voice work provided by Megan Hollingshead.\nEnjoyment: What can I say here? There was nary a moment in this show that I didn't enjoy watching. Gurren Lagann doesn't care too much about real-world physics and essentially runs on a belief-based engine which could bother some people, but this only enhanced the ride for me.\nOverall, while I don't find this show perfect, it's by far one of my top 5. One thing you must realize about me is that fictional works rarely illicit an emotional reaction from me, and this show was one of the first to do such a thing, and that is where Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann succeeds where many, many other anime and shows in general fail. The emotions you experience while watching this are by-products of the character interaction and flow of events within the story, unlike many shows (particularly the ones worshiped by Tumblr) which intentionally pander to the \"feels\" crowd and comes off as forced. I personally feel that any anime fan should at least give this show a try despite its somewhat \"overrated\" status.\n        "},

This show is easily the most entertaining of all shows, and mech anime to ever grace the world of TV. This show is balls to the walls amazing! However if your looking for a deep plot with mystery and all that, you might want to look somewhere else. This show is pure popcorn matireal and nothing else, it just packs a punch few can match. so let's get started\nThe story of Gurren Lagann is actually pretty epic, mainly man is forced to live underground, because beastmen have taken the land with their powerful fighting monster\n          \n        mech's, gunmen. eventually the three main characters, Simone, Kamina and yoko, make it to the surface with a small gunmen named lagann, and begin the fight to get man back to the top of the food chain. The story of Gurren lagann is simple yet absolutely amazing, because, it knows exactly what it is. This show never tries to hide what it truly is, but it does change for a little bit when the show makes a huge time gap, and everything is  taken seriously for a little bit before getting ridiculous again. While some people find this to be the boring part of the show, i thought it just made the show that much better. In a show like this, it would get boring to see nothing but absolute insanity all the freaking time, in the end it just kind of showed you that this show was able to be serious when it wanted to be, and be able to be as nuts as possible when it wanted to be, which fear not it is is absolute insanity more than 2/3's of the time, hell more like 7/8's of the time, because that serious part people keep complaining about is really not bad at all. \nThe animation for Gurren Lagann was done by Gainax and they gave something really good this time. They have a look they always use, and it fits Gurren Lagann perfectly. However their animation has never been something to say OMG to. But this one being the special anime that it is, the last few episodes were absolutely astounding to witness. The only episode that is BLARINGLY obvious that it looks horrendous, is episode 4. Episode 4 was handled by someone else and whoever he is, made that episode look horrible, it just didn't fit gurren lagann what so ever. I would love to forgive it, but this episode introduced a very re occuring character and his enterance looked terrible. So aside from that episode, everything else ranges from decent to absolutely amazing.\nIn the sound department of things, everything plays smooth, and every scene has just as epic music as it does fight scenes. The oh so popular song row row fight the powa! is a song that is the definition of Gurren Lagann. The opening as it were is also in the same category, and it gives you a Gurren Lagann feel to it, and I'm very happy it didn't get changed, because it's an opening that didn't need to change, and most anime openings that are great, but one of two, usually the second one sucks in comparison anyway, so thank god it stayed until the end, you'll thank me later. As far as dub vs sub. you can go either way on this one. The dub is very well done this as Yuri Lowenthal doesan amazing Simone and Kyle Herbert is amazing as Kmina as well, perfectly displaying the mad man on screen in english audio. The sub is very fitting as well, as no matter what audio i watched this in (yes i watched way more than once), the show always had that epic feel to it, and being that that's what the show went for, i really don't see why to pick one over the other, so it all comes down to personal preference in the end of the day.\nThe characters of Gurren Lagann are probably the best part of this show, so this should be sweet and quick. We have Simone, who goes through many changes and gets much character development, we have Kamina, just gonna have to watch to understand him because my words can't do him justice, and yoko who gets just as much evolution in her character as Simone or anyone else in this show, and the list goes on and on and on and on. The character roster for this show is so big I'd be here all day is i had to describe every character, so just take my advice and believe me they are awesome!\nNow overall, this show (aside from the crappy episode 4) is an absolute classic, and a must watch, even if your not a mech fan. This show is so hard not to enjoy, the hardest thing to do is to not enjoy it, because it is an amazing piece of work that no one should miss.\n        "},

(this is my first review, so bear with me)\nStory: 10\nThe story was absolutley amazing and kept me on the edge of my seat basically the entire time. Throughout the 27 episodes, you can clearly see the main characters get better and better. Not only did it make the story line even better, it made me want to give it it's full attention, to the\n          \n        anime world!\nArt: 9\nthe art is a little old in this anime, but that just makes it a classic and even more enjoyable. \nSound: 10\nThe sound is unlike something i have never heard before! i was caught off guard when i heard the intros, commercial breaks, and outros of the show. It made the whole show it's little unique thing\nCharacter: 10\nNot only is there a ton of character development, you will find yourself loving each one! *potential spoiler* TTGL showed the main characters from being kids and 'young' to being 'old' adults! Their characters are very likable!\nEnjoyment: 9\nThis show kept me guessing at what would happen next, you would never even think of something like 'that' happening! The only thing, is that too many of the characters that i loved died, in my opinion. \nOverall: 9\nThis anime is by far one of the best shows i have ever watched. i have seen a lot of anime, and i didn't think i would see a good one ever again until i ran into TTGL\nTo my surprise, the anime was so beast! So, if you are pondering if whether or not you should watch it, WATCH IT! you wont regret it! no matter what genre you favor, TTGL lives up to expectations and beyond. \"have you forgotten? this is the drill...That will pierce the heavens!\"\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I usually don't watch animes, due to their usual theme, i have a few favorites such as Neon Genesis Evangelion and Akira, but the cliche typical shonen junk isn't my type. I dislike everything about them, so its still very surprising to myself, as to why i absolutely love Gurren Lagann. Read on, and find out.  \nOne of the most surprising animes i've watched in a long time, my expectations of it were low considering the art style, and the overall feel of it. To be honest, i wanted to quit after episode 9, and almost did. But a couple of days later, i\n          \n        decided to continue watching it, out of boredom. In the end, i slapped my self to wake up, because now Gurren Lagaan is, surprisingly, one of my personal favorite animes of all times. \nWhy i love it? Its basically a story were it tells you that you can do anything, if you have perseverance, faith in yourself and never give up on your dream. Even though there may be bone wrecking difficulties on the way, as long as you keep your head up and fight the unbelievable odds, you will succeed. There are many memorable quotes, such as:\n\"Believe in me, who believes in you\"\n\"Believe in you, who believes in yourself\"\nAnyway, the characters are great, not one-dimensional as other typical shounen animes, the story's progressive nature is wonderful, the action is fantastic, and the musical score is beyond incredible. \n27 episodes of pure enjoyment. If you plan on quiting, at least try to watch until episode 8. I know it'll seem overrated at first, but trust me. This is one incredible piece of art that is actually underrated. \n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is probably the most unique anime I have ever seen. The ways it presents itself and explains itself are as if they don't really care about your opinion of it. Gainax has made this anime and boldly (and I mean boldly!) shoved it into your face. A lot of people can be put off by this but also many people enjoy this aspect of Gurren Lagann. If I were to show someone, who has never seen the series, one of the ridiculous fight scenes they would probably laugh at the ridiculous or just push it aside as something silly. In order\n          \n        to enjoy this anime (like most animes) you have to start from the beginning. I know this is true for nearly all anime but this is greatly emphasised in Gurren Lagann.\nFirst of all, this is a mecha anime but also very different to every other mecha anime ever. There are a few reasons why this is. One of them is that the robots in this don't seem to be as significant as the mechas in, let's say, Gundam. The mechas aren't the main focus of this anime. Another reason is that there is little or no explanation that goes into the mechas. You don't need to know why Kamina randomly spawned a huge ass drill out of his robot, I was wondering where he even got that drill. The last reason is that what wins fights in this anime is not because one team has better mechas but because of the pilots themselves.\nStory:\nThe story is relatively simplistic. You know, basic rebellion type story to fight against some evil ruler. However, this simplicity fits quite will with the anime. If it was any more complicated, the story wouldn't support this boldness. It is quite fast paced and there could have been atleast 10 more episodes but if it was too fast, viewers would get disinterested. Not much to say about the story, the pre-timeskip story and post-timeskip story are fairly similar except that the atmosphere of the post-timeskip is quite different and you could say this part is more romanticised.\nArt:\nThe art is good and slightly more cartoon like (in my opinion anyway). The animation is very fluent, especially in the fight scenes which makes them more epic. Some of the characters support the ridiculousness of the anime simply because of they way they are drawn. The art of characters like Kamina or Simon (later in the series) emphasise their manliness even further than they are portrayed.\nSound:\nThis anime's soundtrack has a large variety of music. Many of it supports the build up of the anime and also supports the 'epic' or 'manly' scenes. Although the pieces are amazing, like the story and art, it suites the anime well. The opening theme, once again, supports the large build up and 'epicness' of the anime. 'Sorario Days' redone to suite Gurren Lagann. Overall, the music is average but unavoidably engaging when in this context.\nCharacters:\nThis is one of the strong points of Gurren Lagann. The main character, Simon, goes under quite a lot of development and seems to become a completely different person by the end of the series. Simon is constantly pushed by his 'bro', Kamina which seems to be the most popular character in the series. Kamina is the physical embodiment of epicness, manliness and fearlessness. He acts like some unstoppable force that continues to support Simon until the very end. Yoko, at first, seems to be there as a source of fan service and is often overlooked as a character. She also develops as a character quite a bit and takes a role of responsibility. Nia is an interesting one.\nEnjoyment:\nOverall, I enjoyed Gurren Lagann quite a bit. The key to the enjoyment is to not be put of by its boldness and ridiculousness. At first, my friend was put of by this but I forced him to watch the series and he thoroughly enjoyed after looking deeper into it. If one just watches it solely for the ridiculous fight scenes, galaxy-sized mechas and huge ass drills they will most likely become bored of this repetitive behaviour. Luckily, after watching the first episode or two, it is easy to see the other important aspects of it. This anime appeals more to the male audience because of the male gender roles and overall boldness displayed in the series.\nThis series can be really enjoyable if you ignore that fact that it makes absolutely no sense. You can just laugh and cheer along as the characters whip out massive, overpowered weapons. The funny thing is, that after experiencing an unrealistic scene, another one will pop up and be even more unrealistic (this eventually leads up to the characters piloting galaxy-sized mechas).\nIn conclusion, many of you will check out the series solely for the bold ridiculous fight scenes and perhaps the fan service but you may accidentally become engrossed in this continuous spiral of epicness growing larger with each revolution (drills are the overused metaphor in the series). I know I did and many I know did too. Just beware of the unrealistic aspects and hype. \n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    Very disappointed.My friend got me to watch this series claiming its better than Code Geass. Its rankings (on myanimelist.net) would also back that claim up, along with a couple quick Google search. \nHowever, after watching 5 episodes i was not impressed. This series is very similar to that of Pokemon/Inuyasha. New Episode, new day, new village, same enemy. The conflict/enemy is resolved at the end of the episode and thus our heroes continue their journey towards the destination. \nI told my friend this, and he told that episode 8 is epic. So I skipped 6 and 7 only to be disappointed again. \nI wrote this\n          \n        review after watching only 6 episode because I feel that this series, like Pokemon, will continue down the path of predictability.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    FUCKING AMAZING.\nDo you think I'm lying? \nWatch the first three episodes.\nSeriously though, this is the most over-top-super-over-done-awesome-anime ever. Every episode is a ministory from start to finish, a very awesome story that peaks, but never declines. The series never has any declines in its awesomeness as well. Let me explain this. There is something in the shonen anime I like to call the awesomeness factor. This means, the level of amazing power that the main character (or supporting character) unlocks as time goes on. Usually with a series this power caps off at a certain point, or may even decline. However, with Gurren Lagann, the\n          \n        awesomeness level takes a constant, fullspeed rise to the top, and explodes with spiral energy. The main character quite literally goes from being a poor digger to being the master of the universe. \nAlso, there is another thing I like to call the bitchassness factor. Usually in shounen anime, the main character is a BITCH. He'll have the power to always save the day, but he always will need his friends to push and prod him to do it. Or the bitchassness factor could get so bad that he'll spend quite a few episodes complaining about not being able to do his best (Eureka Seven *cough*). Gurren Lagann manages to keep the bitchassness to a minimum, and even while it occurs, the story still manages to progress and take sharp turns and plot twists, so the show still manages to stay interesting.\nLet me put this in technical terms, Gurren Lagann's Awesomeness level: Over 9,000\nGurren Lagann's Bitchassness Level: 5\nIn layman's terms, this Anime is FUCKING AWESOME\n\nwatch it :)"},

The plot is simple but well executed and unpredictable, and most of all, it wraps itself up.  By the end of episode 27 you know that the story has come to a satisfying and complete end, none of this half assed 'the end... or is it?' stuff that most other series of this length employ to arouse hopes for a second season.\nArt:8\nThe general style is unconventional and over the top, and can take a bit to get used to but is ultimately very good.  There are\n          \n        a few times when sequences are obviously recycled to save on production costs, and there are times during fights that the animation is going to fast and crazily that you can't tell quite what's going on without rewinding and watching again.\nSound:9\nGood soundtrack, the songs from Shoko Nakagawa are catchy and very fitting, background music is always appropriate for the mood (loved Viral's theme) and flows nicely throughout the series.  No complaints, but why not a 10?  Because in ten years I don't imagine that the music will be among my favorite anime soundtracks of all time.\nCharacter:10\nPerhaps not completely original and new character designs, but nuanced enough to feel very unique.  Gurren Lagann has some of the most memorable characters out of all the series I have watched.  Simon and the Gurren-dan represent the purest essence of the burning resolve that all of us wish for at some point, and yet for their greatness and heroism they are very much human, emotional, quirky, and lovable.  I'm usually a pretty detached viewer but I know my heart burned for their victories and inspirational speeches, and ached for their hard-hitting sacrifices.\nEnjoyment:11!\nThere's some magic about Gurren Lagann.  It's hard to say where it is, and the show doesn't break the mold in any one category, but as a whole, it is an extremely memorable and unbelievably enjoyable show.  Remember the first time you got hooked on an anime?  Maybe it was the first time you saw Goku go super saiyan years and years ago, or maybe it was something else, but just imagine reliving the sheer excitement and awesomeness during each of the last 15 episodes.\n        "},

I Loved it. Loved every single random moment and every facepalm and every time i laughed so hard i had to pause.\n          \n\nUntil i hated it. Hated since the death of Kamina. Since the first unfulfilled promise and heartbreak of Yoko. Since Simons breakdown. Not one moment since then was fulfilling and balanced. Something seemed out of place all the time, like Simon in the politics, like Black siblings so far apart, like Yoko, the hot and powerful Yoko as school teacher, like countless Lagann transformations (Seriously? he was standing on a fucking galaxy??? o.O), like fucking Viral as co-pilot, like so many deaths, like second broken promise to Yoko, and second time breaking her heart into pieces. (Yeah, i really felt for her). And here they go, defeating the final boss come back to Earth, and there, the gentle second Simons love Nia dissapears at the very tender moment of her life, saying the words of love as a goodbye.\nIf you think about it, noone from the very first Gurren squad (Kamina, Simon, Yoko, Ron, Boota) reached their happiness, except maybe that damn half-gay fish looking Leeron. Don't get me wrong, i think he/she's amazing, honestly. Just general hate.\nAnd there, all the yesterdays heroes shut themselves in nearly soltitude and slowly spiral their way into their doom. Well. Fuck. Where's my fucking happy ending with shit and giggles??!!!\n        "},

This beats em all, because the mechs dont do the same thing over and over. Like in Full Metal panic, gundam, and Etc., they just have guns and explosives. Yet Gurren Lagann had drills. And they had fusing. Which was pretty cool. The main characters were good. But the supporters are like filler characters. Didnt really do anything. The art isnt bad, reminds me a little of old school animes art. The story was pretty good, i think it couldve had a little\n          \n        more though. Overall a 9 i say. I would recommend this to almost anyone, mainly the mech fans!\n        "},

The smooth animation combined with its heart gripping story makes one of the best anime ever. The relationships between characters are very deep and their personalities stand out effortlessly. \nStory-\nThis is the best part of the whole anime. The story is by far one of the most unique ones out there. The oddest part is that its rather short, but it feels very long. At first look, it doesn't seem very good, but it doesn't take long for you to get sucked in. The story progresses very quickly\n          \n        but it doesn't lose any of its rush. Each and every character has a role and they each give something important to the story. It's a story about friendship and the struggle against power. \nArt- \nThe art is amazing. The animation is so smooth that it feels more like a movie than an anime. The artist was able to truly capture the feeling of being in an vast world, yet at the same time it felt empty.\nSound-\nThe music in this anime was superb. It matched perfectly with the theme of the anime. The VA and sound effects gave a realistic feeling to the show. The music was a big part in making the anime feel epic. It was full of emotion and excitement.\nCharacter-\nEach character is connected to each other through relationships with other characters. Theres a broad cast of characters, each with a unique personality. Bonds and rivalry are what make this anime so great. \nOverall-\nI'm not a big mecha fan, but this anime was so perfect that it didn't matter. The shear Plot is enough to satisfy any anime fan. It's dramatic, emotional, funny, and kickass at the same time. It's an adventure comprised of an epic story with great characters and awesome music. \n        "},

Well, TTGL isn't one of those anime's. No, this one is even greater than those. I can assure you that TTGL will completely blow you away. \nTTGL received several achievements in 2007 like best action, best soundtrack and surprise hit and i'll tell you this: It totally deserved it! Though it just missed the price of 'best anime' since Code Geass was the winner\n          \n        in that category. But don't be mislead, i've seen them both and in my personal opinion it's a status quo. Code Geass is a lot more 'serious' than TTGL. The atmosphere is darker, political situations are worked out in depth, even the artwork is a lot more 'mature'. \nBut this is why TTGL is, pure enjoyment-wise, superior. The art may look childish at first, the characters and storyline may come over as shallow but nothing is less true. As you continue in the story you will notice more than once that you are completely intrigued, sucked in. The characters that looked shallow at first grow and develop throughout the story and you will certainly grow along with them. Every problem they encounter, every tear they shed and every laugh they utter.  None of it will leave you untouched. The art isn't an obstacle for that at all, on the contrary. The overload of colours and flux of images contributes greatly to the 'feeling'. Especially during the action and comic scenes you will notice how great the artwork actually is.\n'Best action 2007' it said. But still it took me some while to actually begin with TTGL because i'm really against mecha action normally, I had the same with Code Geass. But seriously, don' t let that stop you if you feel the same about mecha. This is mecha on a complete new level, stop thinking gundam 'cause this ain't nothing alike. The mecha action in TTGL is both comical and astoundingly spectacular at the same time!\nOf course there has to be some great OST's alongside such a great anime you think? Well, yes indeed there is. Especially during the most critic events in the story the music will grasp your breath while you are still in awe of what is actually happening. \nI know this review is very general but i can't go in details without giving spoilers and that's something what i won't do since the surprising plots are one of the main factors which make this anime so great and unique. To finish I just want to remind you guys that this review is completely subjective, so don't come bashing on my profile if you have a bad taste and dislike TTGL. But i promise it won't come to that, trust in my words and just go check out TTGL and you'll find out that this anime has the greatness to pierce through the heavens !!!"},

It goes from drilling little holes on soil, to battles that involve attacks that equal the burning hellfire of the universe's creation. (No joke). Lots of mechas, manliness, epicness, cool sunglasses, physics breaking, epic speeches, some fanservice, over the top fight scenes, and did I already mention epicness? It's one of a kind, and the very definition of epic.\nIt starts slow though for the first few episodes, and there was an episode with terrible art but if you stop there (which I did at some point), you will regret it (and I\n          \n        really did fking regret that I put the anime on hold until I was forced to watch it again).\n        "},

Just recently announced apparently there is going to be a \"new adaptation\" of Gurren Lagann, so us \"Dai Gurren Lagann\" fans would be absolutely hyped beyond the roof of to space!!!!!!!!!!\nOkay sorry i think i should get on with this... but one quote from the Anime us\n          \n        fans would remember is... \"RAW RAW FIGHT THE POWER\"\nStory 10/10\nThe story like i said would \"blow your mind in to tiny particles\" its a masterpiece. Gurren Lagann is set in a post-apocalyptic future where people live underground, because of the Spiral King. He forced these people to be isolated underground and adapt there, so as i watch i think to myself \"what's the point of life then\". People dig and dig to expand the area, people have to sacrifice their lives to maintain the village population underground, so \"what's the point of life?\" and \"Why do us human live?\"\nThis is what our Main Character thinks; Simon... He has no family, all he does in life is dig and dig...\n\nBut however his so called \"older brother\" Kamina is his only friend in the village, together they want to go to the \"surface\" and explore the lands, but obviously this was not going to occur, due to the village elder opinion... but SUDDENLY one say disaster strikes in the isolated village and this gives the chance for both Simon and Kamina to escape, as well as with Yoko, explore lands and fight against Mechs called \"Gunmen\" and slowly discover more unexpected mysteries... theres more to this anime than the synopsis...\nArt 10/10\nIts unique, Cartoonish and colourful, like what else is there to say? Its done by studio Gainax so obviously is different to other shows.\nThere are really unique shots that are really calming to see. so yup what else is there to say?\nSound 10/10\n\"RAW RAW FIGHT THE POWER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Best OST i experienced for ages, I adore the OST for fuck sake, i got all it downloaded on my phone !!!!!! The opening and ending themes matched with the whole Post-apocalyptic theme of the Anime as well as the OST, so what else am i going to say... \"RAW RAW FIGHT THE POWER\"! THATS IT!\nCharacters 10/10\nI get really emotional when it comes to \"characters\" in Gurren Lagann trust me...\n:-; i don't want to go further in to the characters, each character in the series has an astonishing, unique personality... the feels...\nEnjoyment 10/10\nThere may have been \"minor flaws\" in this series, however you shouldn't really take that to consideration as well as the fanservice, because generally all the enjoyment you experience should nullify both the flaws and fanservice, just in general you would be HYPPPPPPEEEEDDDDD!!!!!!!! through out, if you are not well for fuck sake you are an \"elitist\" or just not in to the genres of the greatness.\nOverall 10/10\n\"DAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIII GURRRRRRRREEEEEEEENNNNNNN LAGGGGGGGGGGGAAAAANNNNN\"  Gurren Lagann is also very inspirational as well, in my opinion, RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!!!!!\nPros\nEverything\nCons\nPositives obliterated the Cons\nArigatou senpais for reading my review!!!!\n\n"},

The pacing is fine and applies constant action; however, this doesn't take away from the shows ability to make you care for its core main characters. Young Simon is spineless and weak, but his idol and Giha Village idiot Kamina tries to force Simon to pierce the heavens as the show itself opens up. I love the first half of the series and how it opens up into a much more complex story than we originally believe to be. The character development that ensures is quite genius. We fall in\n          \n        love with the MIGHTY KAMINA leader of Team Dai-Gurren as it looks like he will likely be the normal fired up main character. We follow his ups and downs in every epic manor leading up to where the story opens in to a larger more purposeful theme. With fighting robots, different dimensional beings (spiral and anti-spirals), and an incredible sound track there is little room for anything boring to be filled in. If you're looking for something not too short, but short enough to exclude filler this seems like a perfect fit. \n        "},

The magma of our souls burns with a mighty flame! Gurren Lagann! Just who in the hell do you think we are!?” - Kamina and Simon....Ill never forget these words...kamina-san u know how to make a man cry...achieving excellence.\nSupp guys back at you with another review here. Now before I get into things I will give you guys a quick rundown of the plot. \nOur MCS Kamina and Simon are raised in a deep underground village thats hidden and basically people have been\n          \n        told that going to the surface is dangerous and so they must stay inside and live dull boring lives without a sky to look up to. Kamina however is a free-spirited loose cannon bent on making a name for myself while Simon is a timid young boy with no real aspirations, while digging he comes across a an ancient war artifact of war which duo calls lagann. Using their new weapon they defeat an enemy that suddenly attacks their village and a long with this enemy comes another character Yoko Littner who is a pretty good female character in my opinion. After the three defeat the enemy they escape the village and behold fly onto the surface as their jaws drop hanging because of the beautiful blue sky while the sun sets and thus the journey of the gurren lagann brigade begins!\nNow Gurren lagann is a action mecha comedy anime. The anime has a pretty unique art style and actually consists of a lot of shounen elements like power of comrades and never giving up strong MCs and such. But gurren lagann uses these shounen typical elements very well to make the anime shine by making the viewer feeling attached to characters through not just badass fights and victories but also through tiny things like quotes a good example being: “Believe in yourself. Not in the you who believes in me. Not the me who believes in you. Believe in the you who believes in yourself.” - Kamina. On the other hand the anime actually spares no mercy in killing major characters of the anime but in perfectly good scenarios where you expect them to not survive as you would in a shounen anime, wont be going into much detail of who dies and not as that will just spoil it for you souls. As for other elements of the anime TTGL  had decent soundtrack which I think could had been done better but the animation during the fight scenes was very good and entertaining to see. Finally the anime had romance elements which were quiet key to the anime in my opinion as our main characters use their feelings of their loved ones to grasp on to a better tomorrow and move on in the future rather than dwelling and crying over their loved ones. \nHowever TTGL does have its weak points and lets dig right into it. First off from episode 1-8 Simon is a complete worthless drone and has zero personality always relying on Kamina to help him, motivate him and keep fighting him. Also I feel like episodes 1-7 were very dull and boring as it was the same thing happening over and over again and there was no real character development it was more of introducing different characters and a build up for one of the main events that would change the entire anime in just one episode. I feel like gurren lagann is a bit too heavily focused on fighting spirit nakama and never giving up as I would had loved to see Simon go on his journey and come back to save mankind from being extinct but the way how Simon evolves in the anime was much more fitting to a good dumb action anime.\nLastly, even if you are not into mechas I highly recommend it as TTGL is different from other mechas and has its own unique but over the top flashy way of grabbing viewer into its world, so you can together with the characters experience joy,sorrow,love,hate,despair and a fight to the end where humanity stands on their own two legs and uses their own two arms to fight against the evil that awaits them!\nThanks yall for reading the review...until next time!\nCiaoso!!!\n"},

Just like what the creators intended you to do. You do it with the feelings! It is freedom itself, it will make you laugh so damn hard, make you cry and make you dance! ( Because if you watch this anime with your brains on, you'll be bashing this show instead )\nThis anime is really unique! If you have an idea, like your logic and you force it on the show, it will just tell you to shut the fuck up and believe in the power of will! The show is actually illogical, but its illogicality is the core of this show. it's so illogical that it's so damn good!\nthe characters were fun! very fun to watch! there are so many characters that I'll just put the 2 main heroes here.\nif you want a character who doesn't falter even for a millisecond then this Kamina guy is the embodiment of it all! He is not the kind of character who is smart, he is the the character who makes his own almanac! the embodiment of confidence, fuck-logic -I -have- my -own and pure awesomeness!\nSimon is like us watchers before watching the show. not confident in ourselves, just idolizing someone and just on the background to support our idol. But when you put Kamina in it, it makes us believe ( in a good way ) that when you believe in yourself anything is possible ( literally )\nthe ops and ed were great! they really fit the heart-thumping and adrenaline aspect of the show.\nthe only problem I had in this anime was Nia. I only liked her because Simon liked her. and I was a chick-Y x shota-S shipper.\nafter you have finished watching this anime, this epicness will be etched in your heart that when you hear the word \"crazy \" you will remember this journey for a very very long time albeit forever.\n        "},

Now, that's not to say it's perfect writing just because it's over the top. Even though I love this anime with a passion, I feel like I should try playing devil's advocate here, and then I'll tell it from my honest point of view.\nI have to admit, the first time I heard about this anime was way after it had finished it's run. I'm talking as far back as right after I'd been fed up with Elfin Lied, my first anime ever. My friend introduced me to this\n          \n        anime, and because of my prior introduction to anime, I was more than a little sketchy. At first, I watched the first episode with my friend and didn't really find it too appealing. As a matter of fact, I wasn't a big fan of Yoko either when she showed up initially. And yet, about a half-year or so later, I picked it up again on my own. The rest of the show was great...with the exception of Episode 6, I mean. Seriously, Episode 6, looking back on it, can easily be skipped.\nHowever, past that point, the show took a risk and had an amazing plot twist. No spoilers, of course. But the show just became so good so quick that it was my new favorite at the time. But it wasn't long before I stumbled upon other anime such as Sword Art Online, Black Butler, and many more following them. In other words, this show was my first introduction to the good side of anime.\nIn summary, while this show had maybe 3-5 bad moments, the rest of it was just amazing. I definitely suggest you check it out if you like a good story.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    TTGL, the classic, hailed masterpiece by many, felt like a long journey to me. \nIt was an anime that has surprised me and disappointed me at the same time. I haven't seen an anime which left me conflicted in quite some time. Had I watched 10 years earlier, I would have gave nothing but praise to this anime, as it has explored concepts that were never explored by anime during this time period.\nSo is Gurren Lagann a \"classic masterpiece\"? In short answer, \"No\". The longer answer, \"it depends on how you look at it\".\nBut why a such low rating (6/10)?\nFirst of all, I tend to\n          \n        give an average anime 6/10, so that places TTGL in the average section for me as of right now. It's has an interesting story but full of just flaws and character archetypes I couldn't stand.\nIt is also an anime that gets away by the phrase \"cuz it's anime\", which I generally don't like.\nJust as a reference, I dropped this anime a few times in the early episodes then later decided to finish the anime. I finished the last three quarters of an anime in 3 days, and binge watched the second half in one sitting. \nStory: 5/10\nThis was the hardest section for me to rate. TTGL had iconic quotes and masterpiece episodes which I would easily give 10/10 (episode 8/9), but also subpar cliches and character archetypes which I would place in the lower half.\nTTGL is a story about a boy's journey to discover his existence, the universe, and all else beyond the horizon. It starts off comedic for the first quarter, delving into the adventures of a young boy Simon, and his idol Kamina. It soon turns into a battle for existence and the search for the human soul, adding on to the philosophical question behind meaning of life, something never really explored inside a shounen. However, the execution of this sagacious subject is below average.\nThere are just too much cliche character archetypes and stereotypical anime routines such as screaming for power or fan service plot or the classic power of friendship and on and on and on.\nIt's not that I wasn't a fan of quick transitions to the next battle, but how generic the transitions and the tension was. \nAnd I just felt like that some side characters were being killed in the last battle to evoke a sense of emotion.\nTL DR; Amazing concepts. Poor execution due to cliches.\nArt: 8/10\nI can't judge art. But solid. But was sad that my streaming service only offered 480p.\nSound: 5/10\nAn anime that excels in this department would be the Monogatari series. There are various theme song all evoking different emotions adding on to the layer of perfections. TTGL, however was meh in this field. I couldn't notice the soundtrack adding on to the layer of emotions (which could have been due to the story). And it had some mismatched timings for the opening theme song placement in my opinion. \nCharacter: 7/10\nWell characters in TTGL are mostly either way above average or cliche and subpar.\nKamina, despite feeling like a stereotypical careless hotshot guy, is far beyond that. He is a symbol for much more; he is definitely one of my favorite characters I have seen so far.\nSimon is also a likeable character; although he may be the stereotypical \"coward\" character int he beginning, watching his growth was just satisfying.\nAnd this show has a complex villain which we can relate to, which I never expected from an anime made in 2007.\nAnd there are the cliche characters...\nKittan, is the stereotypical hotshot character in any shounen anime.\nThe missile launcher guy is the stereotypical anime guy who gets the main character into troubles.\nLeeron, is a character that works as a plot armor.\nRossiu is the stereotypical \"I can't bend the rules\" guy.\nYoko felt like a fan service character to me... and was solely there to add romantic elements without depth.\nAnd these cliche characters archetypes just wasn't an element of masterpiece.\nEnjoyment: 6/10\nI found myself skipping some section near the end due to cliche plot elements. But there were just scenes in which I could not take my eyes off from. The episodes are mix of 10/10 and 2/10s and kinda kept me alert to watch more. But I was kind of disappointed by the hype the name TTGL had in the anime community.\nTL DR; TTGL is full of complex thematic elements with a mix of masterpiece and cliche archetypes.\nIt is not \"classic masterpiece like Cowboy Bebop\" due to inconsistent execution.\n        "},

The character's all have personality's that are really hyperbolized, the story gets really confusing in the second act with too much information, and the fight scenes get really big. That's also one of the main reasons I like this anime so much. It may not be the best, with an ending so crap I would almost pass some other anime endings off as good. Its the fact that it knows what it is, and uses that to its advantage. The first fight is about 10 minutes\n          \n        into the episode. The absolute moment a giant robot fell through the roof it was clear that this was going to be an interesting anime at the least. Then it proceeds to just get larger and larger till your wondering how big it'll get. I also enjoy the semi unique art style. at first I thought it wasn't an anime to begin with until I got further in. I say this is worth watching if you have the time. the first few episodes are a bit quick but then it slows down a lot. it does get a bit quicker by that point and then you sorta get the gist on where it will go. To date my favorite anime. It is one of those things where if you stop on the third episode you will hate it. BUT if you can stomach the first 7 episodes it will get better. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I had extremely high expectations of this series going in. It's got a great rating and it is highly regarded by many anime enthusiasts. Having just watched Kill la Kill and being extremely entertained for most of it, I was expecting Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann to show me more of what I loved: a blitzkrieg of absurdist comedy and stylish characters. It does pretty well for a while, with successful comedy and characters and big, beautiful action. But after some time it sort of... takes a dive and loses a chunk of what made it special.\nI think TTGL is a fine show. It's just a\n          \n        show that also happens to suffer in plot and characters pretty irredeemably. Half of the show is about plot and drama, so this is a pretty serious issue. Regardless, the art is great, the spectacle is fantastic, and there are plenty of feel-good moments. \n\n[Rating]\nStory: 6\nArt: 10\nSound: 7\nCharacter: 6 \nEnjoyment: 8\nOverall: 7\n\n[Story: 6]\nThe story is a just a classic coming-of-age story, which of course there is nothing inherently wrong with. There's also tons of commentary on the power of the instinctual improvement, determination & emotion, and being human. I was hoping that this might be a point that inspires me to actually do something with my life, but the plot only gets less convincing as it goes on. It is structured as a plot that constantly tries to one-up itself, where they are brought to the brink of despair but somehow pull it out by being cool. That isn't something I mind, and it provides some pretty good forward momentum, but the show even acknowledges that this is how it's going to go, so the 'tension' isn't really there. It's not bad, but the characters can't always carry the plot so well, especially near the end where the audience can predict the ebb and flow of events. The characters that carry the ebb and flow of events get gradually worse.\n\n[Art: 10]\nGreat style, amazing spectacle in action scenes, gorgeous color palettes, willing to experiment with artistic styles, strong use of light, often good shot composition, strong character design.\nSometimes animation gets a little lazy when characters are far from the scene, but happens infrequently.\nLet's just... Not talk about episode 4. For anyone who didn't know, they put a different animation team on  E4 with intention of rotating teams over the course of the series. E4 got such a negative reaction that they were canned immediately. What an eyesore, jesus. \n\n[Sound: 7]\nNothing to see here. Totally decent sound work. Doesn't really do much wrong, but doesn't do a whole lot to enhance the work. Doesn't really go either way.\n\n[Character: 6]\nThe character cast is big. That is something that the show succeeds at. Many of the throwaway characters are have funny little quirks that the audience is always happy to see. Some characters that aren't main characters turn out to be awesome later on in the story, like Kittan and Rossiu. The roster has awesome breadth. However, the depth of the main characters is the biggest issue.\nAlright, you've got Kamina. Kamina is the man of men and is a great character, should be no surprise. \nYou've got Simon. Simon is... In the first arc his development is satisfying and his interactions with Yoko and Kamina feel totally on point. In the second arc he's just a 'let's do it!' machine, which is pretty uninteresting. Especially because his main motivation in the story is based on his relationship with Nia... and Nia is such a shitty character, but we'll get to that.\nYou've got Yoko. Jesus Christ they completely sidelined this character. She had great potential due to her place in the first arc. She feels like a compass and an anchor for Simon, something that would say \"I want you to do the best you can and belong in this weird world, but I also want you to be more like Kamina\". She balances and frames Simon and Kamina pretty damn well. Then in the second arc she is just a girl with a gun and fan-service, with no real impact on any of the characters. She becomes equal to all the other throwaways. I would've liked to see Simon and Yoko develop their relationship more, in whatever capacity. \nThen we have Nia... Nia is a big part of the second arc. Nia sucks. Outside of her visual design, she is just a girl who talks softly and strangely, doesn't know much about the world, and believes in Simon. That's it. She yet she is a focal point of the plot since she is strongly tied to the events in the second arc and has a strong relationship with Simon. This is the kind of thing that not only bogs down the story but also cripples Simon's character. Why should he care so much about this loser? Is there something wrong with him? \nI also just don't understand the point of having Viral in the story. He is more prominent than the other backgrounders, but never really does anything... nor does audience ever believe that he will do anything. My guess is he serves as a sort of measuring stick for how Simon does at fitting Kamina's image, but there are other ways of doing that with the rest of the cast (like by using Yoko).\n\n[Enjoyment: 8]\nThe art alone makes the action fun to watch. It isn't well-choreographed or anything, but the sheer execution of the spectacle of it all is definitely satisfying. Hell, despite the obvious oscillating nature of the plot, the spectacle had me pretty excited and eager to see what was next.\nSeveral great character moments, though moreso in the first arc.\nI'll say that one of my favorite parts of the series, in the beginning, was the creativity that Kamina and Simon had in dealing with their opponents. It feels more like a comedy/parody of the mech genre, the kind of visual comedy I loved seeing in Kill la Kill. However, as the series continues, this sort of stuff gets replaced by boring, predictable drills and a lot of the comedy is lost.\n\n[Overall: 7]\nStory and Characters take a big dive in the second act. This doesn't completely kill the series by any means since the action is still beautiful and there is a decent amount of forward momentum, but many of the main characters just don't really offer anything by the end of it. I still had a good time watching and would recommend it to anybody who is into this kind of stuff. Maybe I'll be able to look back on it for advice in growing up.\n"},

It puts every little effort into making each moment and detail as fun and exciting as possible. The story is a simple hero's journey, split over two different arcs separated by a time skip. It follows Simon, a boy forced to live underground his entire life, making his way to the surface with his spiritual brother Kamina and a surface dweller named Yoko. It does its job in moving the characters forward which is all it needs to do. Gainax Studios are at their absolute best here, with one\n          \n        of the single most aesthetically pleasing art styles I've seen across animation backed up with a killer soundtrack, great voice acting, and fluid movement in every frame. This show is not \"objectively\" the greatest. Its themes are rather shallow in depth, and character development is handled very straight forward and predictably. But it's simplicity done to near perfection. Every major event for Simon's character growth is handled perfectly, hyping the viewer up beforehand and riding that high for the entire scene, whether it be a fight, a kiss, or a simple line or two about his bro. I'd be shocked if anyone watched this show and found zero enjoyment in it.\n        "},

The character development in this anime is something I have never seen before. Not only the protagonists grow... You grow with them. And at the last chapter you feel different, realized. It is a unique experience.\n10.\nThe music makes the evironment even better. You start with the amazing Sorairo Days theme, you pass through Happily Ever After, Rap wa Kan no Tamashii Da and Libera Me\n          \n        From Hell, and then you finish with more amazing songs.\n10.\nThe animation is delightful. Classic style from old Dragon Ball days, with a minimal use of CGI. Every single frame is a piece of art. The eyecatches brings you a feeling of... Mhm... \"A badass comercial cut\".\n10.\nAll of this, of course, could mean nothing if the action wasn't so great. Do not expect to watch a new Evangelion, because this is other level of mechas. The big machines called \"ganmen\" in the show move like persons and they don't use guns. But why? Well, because a ganman is the representation of the spirit of the driver. That's why Simon and Kamina fight together... Because they are one with Gurren Lagann, the main ganman. This brings a sentimental touch to the action scenes so strong you can easily cry at the last episode while they are fighting.\n10.\nOverall, this TV show is everything you can expect of a masterpiece. An anime so unique and powerful that you will never forget it, either you like it or hate it.\nGive it an opportunity, you will not regret it.\n        "},

The entire series revolves around fighting an enemy, losing to said enemy, but then, magically, finding a solution and winning!

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Ok I'm gonna be quick with this one. The story is about Simon and his friend Kamina who strives to seek the surface. One day Simon finds a giant head and a tiny gold drill and a mecha called a Ganmen attacks their village. It is then that they meet Yoko, discover the power of Ganmen and break free from their village.\nThis anime is filled with a lot of hope and fighting spirit. Pretty much everything is way over the top which makes it more enjoyable to watch. Sometimes the most unrealistic things can get your blood pumping the most, and that's what TTGL does.\nIt's\n          \n        a simple plot really, destroy the enemy and regain the surface. It is also incredibly cheesy. It's so cheesy it's ridiculous but it's still funny. Some episodes are repetitive which can make it tedious at times. The series was put on hiatus for a while coz I just couldn't be stuffed watching the rest. However, if you do get to that part, fight the urge of dropping it. It's really worth watching the whole thing.\nSo the plot is simple but it has quite a few twists and turns that will shock you for the entire anime. It did for me anyway. Even so, the twists develop the characters greatly. \nThe cast is just great. I love them all. One of two I found a tad annoying but pretty much, I loved them. The minor minor characters don't get a lot of screen time but you still get attached to them. TTGL is definitely a character-driven anime, no doubt about it. I'm a fan of character-driven anime so it's a bonus for me. Loved the cast.\nArt was smooth and just pretty. I don't usually have much to say about art but if I like it then it's good. I'm quite picky with the graphics. I loved the sound. The OP is just great. The sense of hope in it sends shivers down my spine. I only skipped the OP a couple of times coz I wanted to finish the anime a couple of minutes faster :P The EDs weren't really to my taste. Just not my style of music I guess. Second ED was more endurable for me. BGM really gets the blood going. I loved the BGM, the music was placed at the right scenes and really brings out that sense of hope. It also really suited the setting of the anime as well. It was just great.\nI loved TTGL. Sure it can get a bit iffy at times but do watch it till the end. It is really really worth it. It's epic. It's fun, over the top and cool which makes it epic. The fighting scenes are awesome though tedious. Oh yeah, I also really liked it because everyone had an opinion. It wasn't 'oh he's the leader, let's follow him and not think for ourselves'. Nooo no no, everyone thinks differently and their ideas on saving the world is different. I just find it amazing. Sure it was kinda frustrating coz I wasn't sure who to root for but in the end, you just gotta lay back and watch it. Opinions are harsh to this anime. It doesn't need or want it. It just wants you to have a good time and make you realise a couple of things. \nTTGL certainly wasn't the best but it was pretty damn good. I recommend it to everyone really. You just can't miss out on it. It's be like missing out on Haruhi. I haven't finished watching that but it was pretty big when it was released and is on my 'to finish' list.

It's a show that really grabs your soul and sets it ablaze. If you&rsquo;re ever entering a battle or sporting event, I highly recommend watching an episode or two of Gurren Lagann before hand to pump your self up, it's totally inspiring.\nStory wise, when you begin watching the series you initially think that it's not supposed to be taken seriously. However, after a few episodes the sheer 'epicness' of the plot and characters pulls you in and it becomes the ultimate story which must be handled as a serious matter.\n          \n        It's also something that borrows, or rather parodies other mech and apocalyptic series. Even so, it incorporates these elements in a way that only contributes to its originality. It's everything you've come to expect from Gainax (FLCL, Eva, Abenobashi).\nThe characters really are the soul of the show. It could be said Gurren Lagann is plot driven but it would also have to be said that the plot is character driven. I swear that you will fall in love with Simon, Yoko, Kitan, Viral, and yes, even sweet sweet Kamina.\nThe music of Gurren Lagann is another key draw. Songs like 'Sky-Blue Days' and ''Libera me' from hell' do more to contribute to the enjoyment of this series than the characters or plot do for many other shows that have been released recently.\nAnimation wise....IT'S GAINAX!!! Their name has become synonymous with beautiful animation. \nOverall, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is series that will reaffirm our faith in Japanese animators. It shows that not everything of late is formulaic crap. Thank you and FIGHT THE POWER!"},

In a way it comes off as a stylistic tour-de-force like FLCL, and in other ways it manages to hold on to its plotline much better than said anime.\nThe first 5 episodes really put me off, as they seemed like the generic monster-of-the-week, loud-mouthed screaming of valiant sentences and slapstick-humor kinda deal. Not only that, the monsters were ugly as hell, the mechas seemed over-the-top cheesy (in this day and age), and it just seemed like the whole thing would go down the drain in a bravado of klich&eacute;es\n          \n        and Fischer-Price mechanical constructs.\nHowever, somehow along the way the show manage to evolve, things start to get serious, people start to die, something that one will be screaming for at that point. Politics starts to press in on the juvenile spirit that dominated the first part, and starts to transform the show to a more dystopic outlook.\nIn the end the show literally takes off into space, and starts to go deep with alternate universes, the human condition and more abstract topics (wonderfully done I might add), and explodes in a grandiose hommage to that wonderful japanese concept of 'The Fighting Spirit', with all the cheesy loud-mouthedness that goes with it, and yes, here it fits in.\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Ok, so I'm giving this review, for if nothing else, because this show simply doesn't get enough non- ten out of ten reviews.\nFor one, I enjoyed this anime. For several reasons. But in no way would I ever consider this the best anime I ever watched.\nStory: I'm going to be very generous and give this a 9 out of ten. I really feel like I could give it an 8. Actually scratch that, I'll make it an 8.\nThe story itself, if taken seriously, is not the most breathtaking or in my opinion, anything short of silly. Now not that most other anime is particularly more\n          \n        realistic, but they really went for the zany with the drill power thing. But part of I think the reason the drill power idea was was chosen was to help with that overall fun theme that this show does have and does well. Not every serious part of this show is to be taken absolutely seriously. It is supposed to be fun. And if the main theme weren't so zany in some ways, it would take away from the overall feel of the series.\nI think what does make the story good and is it's plus point, is it is a little bit zany and funny the whole way through. While being epic enough in moments to make you actually take it seriously. And a good pacing, what really makes this anime good more than anything, is the pacing. It gives you several different elements and manages to pull them together in a very good way.\nAnother thing about it and that whole thing is that it pulls in to being a very feelgood uplifting story that will give a person courage.\nStill not deserving of a 10 out of 10 though.\nAlso along with that, this is about the closest thing to a Dragonball Z mecha that will ever come to be. It is WAY OVER 9000!! So those who are starved for an anime truly paralleling the content overwhelmingly epic power growth and mind shatteringly Godlike power of DragonBall Z, this show undoubtedly has it.\nArt: Now this is a real selling point. That artwork is really sleek and just purty even while being what might be called superflat. It shows that anime artwork is still ever evolving and growing. Even if there's some things I like about other styles better, boy is that stylish. No problems here. Not one.\nSound: Well, I'm not that fond of some of the music, and more fond of other. There's nothing particularly lacking about the music or the sound effects, but it's not the best anime soundtrack I've ever heard by a long short. And ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWA gets real annoying real quick.\nCharacters:\nIt only covers a few of the bases in my mind.\nFor one, for those with a homosexual attraction to really many men, you've Kamina. \nAnd even a homosexual. Though not the type one would usually choose for a yaoi slash fic of any type, it's nice that gays get representation in anime.\nPersonally I found the best of this characters fixation with manliness to be a humors silly part of the show. But at other times it felt annoying. You know there's only so much zany humor I can get out of a GAR.\nIf there's any one thing that I could take about his and most characters personality in the show, it was the hope the inspirited. Kamina was an emotional guy, not a logical one. And I don't think this is a spoiler. And so his emotionality of being an emotional, positive guy, made him and the other characters he influences, feel really fun.\nSo you don't have to be homosexual for manly men to like this guy. Looking past that, if you just like happy-go-lucky, emotional, bright eyed characters, he can be fun.\nThe rest of the characters are pretty cool, better so that Kamina, but no one particular memorable that I would ever even close to state was my overall favorite anime character of all time. Personally but, they all have their own charm. No problems, but they're not the greatest cast of all time.\n8 out of 10.\nEnjoyment: \nEnjoyment is actually a 10 out of ten, even though overall this show is an 8 out of ten for me.\nReally, this show has perfect pacing, despite it's flaws. It's very easy to marathon and enjoy for me. I did not feel this huge\nOverall:\nI think despite it's really good aspects, this show has it's flaws. And it is no way deserving out of a ten out of ten or a number one ranking on My Anime List. This is undoubtedly one of the most sickeningly overrated anime shows to ever come out. And I really enjoyed this show.\nBut in the end, it is only like a amped up Outlaw Star to me. And personally, there was even some things I liked about Outlaw Star better. I would say it is only a few points above exactly what Outlaw Star was, and I don't mean rating points.\nNot saying this show is bad, and I've both said a lot of good things about this show and given it a impressively high rating, and I think you should see this show if you actually haven't already. But the idea that this is the best anime show of all time just makes me *facepalm*. So hopefully even though this review is likely to get lost in the sea of reviews, hopefully maybe someone may come by it as a moderately rated and slightly less fanboyish review(I couldn't think of a better word) and have a more general medium idea of it, and not be so disappointing as I was when watching it. Don't go watching it because you think it'll be the best anime of all time, because you'll be disappointed like me, quite possibly.\n        "},

Be careful or the monster that talks to you with not one mouth but two will attack you with ravings of how TTGL is one of the best animes ever. What? Oh yeah reviews. TTGL is just about as over the top you can get, humans live underground and drill to find more drills, all the mecha are different animal heads, there's a lot of flashy explosions and punching, intentionally emphasized character designs, and that's only scratching the surface\n          \n        (I just vomited at my own pun) of this ridiculous show. The action is the draw of the show and during the first episodes I thought I'd just be in for a typical action show, but as the show continues it has a constantly progressing plot that made sense. Seeing Kamina rally everyone around and pierce through the heavens was a really awe inspiring part of the show that stayed consistently good even after, well I think you catch my drift. My favorite part of the show was seeing Simon grow into a man and eventually become a bold leader due to Kamina's influence, and seeing him act against all odds with team Dai Gurren in the second half of the show was great too. However of many good things I have to say about this show, it's important to note that despite the great action and surprisingly plot/character development, there isn't much left to the imagination to ponder with this show, so I wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone looking for something serious or thought provoking. But in terms of entertainment, you're in great company.\n        "},

Let it burn brightly in your heart, and carry you on the wings of freedom.\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the 4th anime I've ever watched, and it is an amazing one in my opinion. The story is told of two boys, Kamina and Simon, living in an underground village in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic era where creatures in Mechs rule the surface, keeping human population and rebellion in check. The duo has\n          \n        the ambition of reaching that surface, and is aided by a girl from another village, Yoko Littner (Or, Yoko Ritona.)\nThe anime has a phenomenally executed storyline. It carries a heavy theme that blood and tears will carry oneself in his or her rebellious endeavors, through all the living hell that someone can possibly go through. The characters are certainly interesting, each having a quirky or not-so-exciting personality, each of which ties in well with the plot. \nThe second arc takes place after the events of the first, in a time many years later. To think a story could still be present makes you feel cautious, yet the creators do not disappoint. Plot twists and different plot development always make you eager to watch the next episode, sitting on the edge of your seat in anticipation.\nPersonally, I may have tried to oversell it, but this anime deserves the astronomical fanbase that it has. The magnitude of thrilling random, exhilarating, and almost insane storytelling makes it almost a necessity to watch a second time; it's much more fun to pick up on everything you may have missed the first.\nThanks for reading, hope I've helped anyone who hasn't watched this take that step. Definitely put it on your queue!\n\"Just who the hell-... Heh. Guess I'm not anyone anymore.\"\n        "},

I also was one of the ones who considered Gurren Lagann overly hyped. But boy, how wrong was I. \nYou will see action each episode and epic ones of course. The story is the strongest point of this anime and the reason is, there is a logical explanation for everything. So I have to strongly disagree that this show \"ain't about story but kickin ass\". It does still kick ass big time but the story is\n          \n        also very good. The story is well paced and \"stuff\" start happening since the beginning. The story gets a heavier atmosphere as it progresses. \nThe art is outstanding. Epic. You will repeat scenes and that PrntScr key on your keyboard will be pressed more times that you have ever pressed it in your life.\n\nThe sound is epic but it would have been better if there was more variety. Still its epic. \nCharacter development is the strongest base of this anime. You will see. \nYou will enjoy it 100% guarantee. \nOverall, you should watch it. If you don't and die, then your life's been a waste. \nAnd to all the haters out there, I was once one of you. Go watch it before you judge it. It's not unlikable.\n"},

Having watched Code Geass, which was a perfect anime in my opinion, I found several suggestions online on  which animes to watch next. Some animes included much of the Gundam franchise, Guilty Crown, and of course Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. I am so glad to say that I was proven wrong. Right from the get-go, Kamina's charismatic and often lunatic personality snatches viewers' attentions and sets the pace for the rest of the anime: you'll often find yourself laughing at\n          \n        the hilarious moments in this anime, nearly tearing up at the sadder moments, and stupidly laughing too yourself at the over extravagant and exaggerated moments. \nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is not deep. If you watched something like Code Geass, Hyouka, or even Stein's;Gate, depth is something you will definitely not find in this story's anime. Honestly, any mecha anime plot shouldn't include much plot because action is definitely one of the core elements. However, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann still retains an excellent storyline. The story centers around several extreme themes, such as vast character growth and epic battles of ridiculous proportions. Through a very rough transition after the first arc, the plot remains strong and downright crazy, but again, this anime is not meant to be deep but instead exists simply for the viewers to enjoy. Despite being the story's biggest problem, the plot still remains simplistically strong and should be thoroughly cherished as it will definitely draw out many different emotions from time to time. \nWhat can I say about the art other than \"Wow\"? It's vibrant flow of colors (especially Nia's hair, damn what's up with that?) I definitely won't say that it's the best I've seen out there; in fact, it's kind of cartoony (not the same as Panty & Stocking). A lot of the scenes seem like it popped out straight from a comic book. However, I absolutely love how the art stresses the reoccuring theme in this anime: it over exaggerates and portrays the silliest things in a serious light. So many of the battles are shaded so much and you can't help but enjoy and sometimes chuckle just because of the art. The mecha designs are fantastic and I love how everything flows together to form a seamless anime. \nThe art may be a great representation of the anime's themes, but boy wait till you hear the sounds of the anime. The OP is a great way to get your blood pumping, and viewers should definitely try to listen to it instead of skipping it. The voice acting is incredible! Kamina's voice is portrayed wonderfully and is the embodiment of life and enthusiasm (\"Who the hell do you think I am??\"). Simon's voice is also extremely suitable; it really showcases his growth as a timid and quiet boy to a bold, brash, and motivating leader. The many voice actors are absolutely wonderful, and it's incredible how much they bring this already invigorating anime to life. The last thing to note is the sound in the ludicrous fights that take place. The music is already amazing during exciting mecha battles that motivate and excite viewers, but what makes it even more incredible is how it adapts to situations. For example, during the sadder moments, the music will change to represent a slower pace, and viewers will hardly notice the smooth transition the sound makes during many of the scenes. \nI already talked about the extraordinary characters, but it's impossible to not stress their amazing prominence in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. How the characters interact with each other, their logical thinking, and their expressions really make this anime what it is. From the crazy yet lovable Kamina viewers build an attraction to the anime. Simon is the epitome of remarkable growth and his interactions with other characters demonstrates his capabilities as a remarkable leader. The boobalicious Yoko serves to offer much-needed support at times and is a crucial character to help many of the others grow. Nia is the motivation that Simon needs and their relationship really showcases how much thought the people at Gainax put into this anime. Overall, my favorite part of this entire anime is the cast of characters.\nEnjoyment is something abundant in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. The anime is overflowing with it. From hilarious scenes such as the awkward mecha combination between Kamina and Simon, to tense scenes such as Simon's personal and internal conflicts, to absolutely ludicrous scenes such as galaxy-sized mechas literally using galaxies as shurikens, this anime offers it all. The story, art, sound, and characters make this anime what it is, and you will enjoy everything this anime has to offer. \nOverall, this anime is brilliant in nearly every aspect. This anime has it all: word play, large galaxy mecha battles, hilarious moments, inspirational speeches, everything. Quotes such as \"WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM\" will forever be etched in your memory and you will enjoy every minute that Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann has to offer.\n        "},

And yet, it is oh so fitting. \nWelcome to Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (TTGL), a ridiculously epic action adventure anime that is so borderline over-the-top at times that you might wonder why you are watching it in the first place. And yet, it is precisely because of that that you are so enthralled in the whole thing. My first advice for new viewers to the show is, don't think, don't judge, just accept it for what it is. It isn't trying to act fancy, deep, dark, and cool. It\n          \n        is a straight up adrenaline filled anime with big fight scenes and loud, in your face characters and personalities. Also, on another note, even though I was never a mecha or shonen fan, I loved this show, so don't brush it it off because of that. \n~Story~\nFrom the dream to travel to the surface, away from the enclosed tunnels and isolation, to an enemy that seems invulnerable and omnipresent; this is the tale of TTGL. With small time beginnings, this epic show takes you on a roller coaster of adventure against enemies and forces that seem unbeatable, and the characters who never give up. Buckle in your seatbelts and enjoy the ride.\n~Cast and Characters~\nWhile the show does have a large cast, there are a few who take the spotlight and shine. Most notably the star of the show, Kamina (◥▶◀◤), who embodies basically everything the show stands for; courage, resilience, standing up for what you believe in, and never giving up. Other major members are Simon, Kittan, Viral, and (sigh) Yoko. They are all different personalities and the one of the show's strength is mixing such a diverse cast and showing off their quirks and growth.\n~Art/Animation~\nThe art and animation were sort of immature and unrefined, but that suited the style of the show. The fighting sequences and some other events were verrrrry well done however, with an explosion of color and animation. \n~Sound~\nNo qualms here. from regular scenes to the epic battle moments. It synthesizes a mix of rap, chorus, and other sounds to get you in the mood. \"Libera me from Hell\" is the most well known track and it's great. \nOverall, this anime is great. It has all the elements I would want in an action anime, and it really pumps you up when watching. It has everything I would want in a proper shounen, but its more than that, anyone can watch and enjoy this. While there aren't any super deep meanings or themes, it encompasses the idea of fighting for your dreams and doing what is right while never losing hope. \n        "},

The best part is that it does all of that and more without holding back; by that I mean it looks exactly how a true anime should look: giant robots, over-the-top animation, a little sex appeal, and battles on a galactic scale.\nThe three major characters - Kamina, Simon, and Yoko Littner - are some of the best that anime will ever see.  For Yoko, it's not just the aforementioned sex appeal.  And for Kamina, it's not just his incredible masculinity. \n          \n        It's about the both of them helping our young protagonist Simon grow up from a timid digger into a dashing hero.  Along the way, we learn with Simon the importance of drilling a hole into tomorrow for our future, rather than staying buried in a pit of despair for the rest of our lives.\nIf you have yet to watch this, you should be aware that while TTGL starts off fairly straightforward, it does start to get a little confusing halfway through the series.  Prepare for some twists and turns.\nUnfortunately, the second half hasn't been received as well as the first, and understandably so.  I said I wouldn't spoil anything (and I won't) but keep in mind that TTGL unnecessarily tries to become something that it didn't start off as, before going back to its roots at the very end.  This could be an unintentional form of symbolism: Simon - following in Kamina's footsteps - tries to live up to everything his \"bro\" became.  Somewhere in the middle he forgets his destiny as a digger; not as one who drills down, but as one who drills up towards the heavens.\nTTGL isn't a true masterpiece, as many make it out to be.  Personally, I believe that it's become pretty overrated by the fans here.  If I were asked to list the top ten anime of all time, Gurren Lagann would certainly not be included.\nThat said, it's still a must watch.  It not only redefines what we think of mecha anime, but it's also one hell of a ride.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    Gurren lagenn is a pretty damn cool anime series that really goes into the action and brings the animation into a whole new level of craziness. I quite enjoyed this anime and it's themes about courage, self sacrifice, and the fighting spirit surly does make it an anime to root for. I admit I'm not a big fan of the mecha genre but i will consider it one of the best out there and recommend to any anime fan. Despite its greatness, I have to say its quite cartoony almost like western animation and honestly it gets way too overboard with action and explosive animation\n          \n        that you can't get a grip onto. Also the whole themes get really old by the end of the first half and I know they are trying to motivate you but like I said, you just role your eyes when they start blabbing about courage, heroism, and all that crap. Another thing too is that many of the characters have two dimensional personalities especially kamina who tries to act like a heroic and fearless man but to me he sounds like an arrogant and narcissistic jerk with a annoying attitude. But the anime had an awesome storyline which led to fighting beastmen on the surface and facing off with aliens in outer space and ultimately led to a sad but satisfying ending for the audience. I also liked the series villain the Anti Spiral who had a weird appearance and was trying to destroy the world not out of cruelty but to save the universe and in a way made him more of a tragic hero than a real villain. The series was great and I liked it very much for great action and story as well as the cool mecha but the animation gets tiring and the themes need to be a little more realistic so we can relate to the characters and they won't get boring and some of them just look ridiculous. The anime was good but tragically flawed and messy, so I give this series a 7 out of 10, so read my review if you have the chance thanks. \n        "},

Honestly, the series is pretty weird, the way it tackles with the mech genre, things like hunger can affect your mechs performance or you can literally just combine two crappy mechs to a more powerful one, but it's that weirdness that makes it AWESOME.  The series is also filled with extreme manliness, it separates the men from the boys (and the gays) LOL. The story of the anime is pretty much complete: there's a major\n          \n        character death, a plot twist, a time skip and a great ending.  \nArt - 10/10\nTTGL artstyle is probably the most of unique in all of anime.  It's probably this aspect that will introduce you to this series.  Animation is also over the top in their designs that adds to the excitement of the series. The reason why TTGL is called the 'father of over the top animes.'\nSound - 8/10\nTTGL opening, in my personal opinion is the best opening of all time.  The song gives you the mood for the upcoming episode everytime it plays and I'm just grateful that the series did not follow the 2 opening format for a 27 episode anime, instead they changed the visuals three times just to indicate present situation of the story and sticked with the same song.  Because the song defined Gurren Lagann itself.  While the rest of the OST, I was not a big fan of it the reason for the 8/10 score.  \nCharacter - 10/10\nFor me, TTGL has 4 main characters - Simon, Yoko Littner, Nia, and Kamina and also supporting characters such as Rossiu, Kittan, and Viral.  While Kamina is the most popular because he's the most badass character not just in the series but all time, because of his fearlessness, he kind of reminds me of Sinbad from the Magi series.  But my favorite of the series will be Simon because he is the most developed in the whole series.  Yoko is also a great female character, knows how to fight and defend for herself and her team.  Nia, on the other hand, is the opposite of Yoko, but her influence gave a great impact to Simon, making her a good character in some aspects.  Kittan, one of my favorite supporting characters in anime,  is like a rival to Kamina in terms of bravery and badassness, indeed fitting of the title 'Space King Kittan.'  The series also gives great antagonists, the best among them being the Anti Spiral King.\nEnjoyment - 10/10\nYou can just check my top favorite anime list in my profile for you to see how much I love this series.  The reason for my love of this series is the lesson of true bravery from the characters Simon and Kamina.  It also give the greatest speeches out there, and also delivered in the best way the Japanese dub can.  Overall, I give the series a perfect 10/10, for my personal pick as the best anime of all time.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Overview (5/5)\nAnimated by Studio GAINAX, written by Kazuki Nakashima and directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi, Gurren Lagann is a stunning display of brilliance with its art style (1, 2, 3), character and plot development that was filled with dramatic highs and lows, plot twists and ability to pull on the heart strands of viewers by touching on philosophical aspects of fate and existence while incorporating well choreographed fight scenes and dialogue. \n\nStory (5/5)\nThe story is a supposedly simple progressive campaign from the \"depths of underground\" to the \"heavens\". The initial start of the series quite standard as it provides no reason beyond \"I want to\" for\n          \n        the start of \"adventure\". Quite substandard for such a well writ anime, I thought. I quickly realized that this progression is consistent with characterization (Kamina) and with the \"drill\" motif carried through the rest of the series.\n\nCharacters (5/5)\nThe characters in this series are brilliantly done, not just complex and deep, but rather have intimate understandings and interactions with surrounding characters. Key characters I'd like to focus on are Kamina, Simon, and Viral. I'd like to also comment on the Helix King and romance aspect of this series. \nKamina, is by far the most \"manly\" character in the beginning of the series, prior to Simon 'becoming' Kamina. The importance of Kamina's drive in life, realization of purposefulness, leadership capabilities and ability to inspire people drove the series forward for the first section. His character is important in the development of Simon, Viral and pretty much all the other characters. \nSimon, the protagonist of the story is just swooning in Kamina's shadow for the first bit of the anime leading me to care little of his existence (and even blame him for Kamina's death). The establishment of Simon as the scared digger who needed someone to support him. In an early struggle, Simon's depression made him an even less notable character aiding the introduction of Nia into the plot and making Nia, in contrast, even more lovable (and whose death more sad). The transformation of Simon into the more boss Simon makes this series particularly interesting as it parallels the how humans develop. We need leadership, we encounter loss and being lost, then we find our light and move on. The beauty of Simon's development and the re-establishment of a \"main\" character who epitomizes \"epic\" makes this series even better.\nViral, the immortal beastman who turns good, is another interesting character who begins as Kamina's rival, but only fights him twice. Viral expresses a \"younger\" Kamina, the one with drive and passion but not know where they are going. Opposite to Simon still. The development of Viral's motives and ideals make this series more of a charm to watch. This transformation mirrors Simon's but in a different direction and parallels humans who may not be \"learning\" but rather are \"learned\" and \"comfortable\" with life not seeing the more far reaching impacts. \n\nAnimation (4.5/5)\nThe Gainex and Imaishi combination proved very successful as anticipated. Animation I found was relatively high quality and consistent compared to other series out there, but not even close to Shinkai's. This consistency and ability to create nice backgrounds and realistic character developments (ageing of characters) made me like it. The unique style reminiscent of Evangelion, but also hinting at the styles at the later \"Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt\" further drew me deeper to appreciate it. In conclusion, I found the anime style very attractive with the majority of the series well done and engaging. \nSound (5/5)\nThe sound aspect of it was well done, and unique much like the animation. The pseudo hip-hop influence really carried the rash personalities and spontaneity of the characters and plot other than that there is little to comment on. \nFor a more comprehensive review please visit:\nhttp://randomryanreview.blogspot.com/2011/12/qerqewrqewr.html\n        "},

There were just a lot of things about the anime that felt distinguished, that stood out, and the characters themselves were a blast to hear, as well as perform from each episode after each episode. It has that certain sense of flare, excitement and animation that makes it not only appealing, but also makes it spectacular to watch as a whole. I'd caught this back in '07, when it first came out, and already, just from the first episode, I was just hooked\n          \n        in right away, with the way how it was crafted, constructed, and very much brought together, to create a sense of such greatness in the making. \nSTORY- 9/10 \nThe story, is pretty amazing by far. At first it may seem a bit simple, but there are a whole bunch of twists and turns, that just take you on a ride, in ways that's just amazing in how it crafts itself from each episode after another. The themes in the show, are also just as compelling, as they teach about going above and beyond, and valuing the people you care about in your life. \nART- 8/10\nThe art style in the show, is very good. While it looks like it's a bit loose and out of place, it still feels authentic, and just cohesive as a whole. I can tell that there are some scenes, where yeah, it feels a bit out of place, and the animation and/or artwork sometimes, looks a little cheap, but it definitely does feel, for the most part, pretty amazing in how it's really nice and compelling to still look at the character's design, in the way how their drawn, as well as the different mecha designs. \nSOUND- 9/10\nThe sound is one that I would give praise to in the series. The soundtrack for the series, is very amazing, with the way how it's made, composed, and there are just a whole punch of awe-inspiring tracks, that just pumps you up, and makes you feel as though, that you can do just about anything. The character's themes, fits well with their personality, and the opening theme song, just feels right with the beginning of each episode, every time. \nCHARACTER 9/10\nThis is where it also shines strongly with the show as well. The characters, in my opinion, feel like archetypes, but with a few twist of different personality traits, that don't feel all that stereotypical. The three main characters, are still hands down my most favorite characters, because they're just fun, amazing, and very enjoyable to watch...even though something happens to one of them, that's just moves the story in such a different direction. Watching these characters, throughout the whole 27 episode series, was just something that I'd found myself immerse in, from their personality traits, their abilities, and just how they just drive the story as a whole. \nENJOYMENT 9/10\nThis is one of the only few animes, that I'd actually found myself re-watching the second time around, in '11, because of just how amazingly enjoyable the whole show is as a whole. Even the story seems a bit simple, the twist and turns, the different personality traits in the three main characters, the entire artwork and soundtrack, just makes them highly enjoyable, and finding myself already reminding myself, from four years ago, of how much I love this show, and how it's just definitely a classic show. \nOVERALL 9/10 \nThis is definitely a show, that you want to put on your shelf, as one of the few greatest mecha anime out there. It's even more enjoyable than Neon Genesis Envagelion, which even though that show is still a classic mecha anime, this one surprisingly just beats it a little bit for me. Definitely worth having on your shelf for this one. Even though, most animes these days, aren't being up to snuff in terms of high quality, as this and a few others shows does. \n        "},

Humble beginnings quickly turn into an over the top adventure where the fate of the world is ultimately thrust into a child's hands. \nThe relationship between the protagonists Kamina and Simon is the one of the strongest I've seen in any media and the two's dependence on one another drives their characters to reach greater heights. When thrust into this brand new world Simon must learn to grow rapidly to protect those he cares about.\n\"Believe in the me who believes in you\"\n          \n        and \"Who the hell do you think I am?!\" are just some of the lines you'll hear in the show that carry surprising weight. For a show about giant robots fighting each other the messages that are provided are mature and meaningful ones. No matter how powerful the enemy, never back down. If you don't believe in yourself, do what you can for others who DO believe in you. That is Gurren Lagann.\nThis series is full of fluid action, meaningful messages, epic music and a whole lot of heart. You can tell the staff at Gainax put their all into this show.\n        "},

While some people think that in order to watch this show you have \"turn your brain off,\" there are others who have even proclaimed the episodes 17 to the last one as a \"study on society.\" I respectfully disagree with both viewpoints; to me, the former underestimates the anime and the latter overthinks it. The thing about TTGL is\n          \n        that it is based on a very stupid concept; that is, gigantic mechas fighting other ones in epic battles which, fortunately, the anime doesn't hesitate embracing. However, if the story has an emotional core, you can violate -although not that much; you have to first establish the rules of the world you have created- laws of reality. There's a certain point in the show, which is one of the most criticized, where it skips seven years; nevertheless, what people seem to not understand about it is that the point of the whole sequence is to establish that the characters have grown up in their own way. There is no need to show what happened throughout those years if there is no development in the characters to convey the show's overall message. If you manage to express values, you can use whatever concept you like, be it dumb or something more grounded.\nHaving said that, and one of the reasons why there is an incredibly polarized opinion, the show is not consistent with its quality. This anime has managed to make me quit watching it for more than six months, but it has also managed to give me one of the best episodes I have ever seen (which is, by the way, episode 26).  There are times where characters develop amazingly, but there are others where it is soulless. This is why, personally, the episodes after the 16 one, albeit not perfect, are just awesome; because we see characters grow and mature. Before episode 16 there are good episodes too, but most are shadowed by one thing: battles. Do not get me wrong, the battles in this anime are visually amazing. Despite the great artistic value on them, it is such a shame that most of them have almost no emotional impact on the characters and thus no impact on us. Haikyuu!'s \"battles\", which are way less epic, against other volleyball teams is more engaging than most battles in TTGL because they showcase conviction; it has a soul, an emotional core. TTGL is amazing when characters develop, not when sudden battles take place; TTGL is even better when characters develop in battles, a thing that rarely happens.\nOne the greatest pros about TTGL are their characters. I will talk about the most important ones in general terms since I think they are the best part of this show, hence why I do not want to give away that much.\nYoko is such a badass, and of course, one of the most interesting characters in this anime. It is needless to say that Yoko, for most of the time, does not wear a lot of clothes. In spite of that, Yoko as a character is not downgraded to \"a pair of t*ts,\" she is treated with respect; actually, I think she is one of the greatest \"f*ck you\" to the typical brainless female character that the anime industry is infamous for by making her wear even more clothes on a certain and obvious occasion. Definitely one of the greatest characters, she is worth watching.\nOur protagonist, Simon, is one of the most complete ones out there. He has a special place in my heart since he reflects so many things about myself, so I might be biased. His \"destiny\" in the anime is simple and obvious from the start, but what shines about this character is the adventure we endeavor with him. I did grow a gigantic sympathy for him thanks to the so many things that happen throughout the story.\nThe other characters are cool too, I just wish we could have more time with them so we develop more empathy. It is a shame since they are interesting too.\nAnd then Kamina. I left him to the last part since, well... you will know. Hopefully when you find out why you will understand why I wrote the following. To me, Kamina, rather than being another character, he is more of an ideal. This \"character\" doesn't develop that much since his establishment from the beginning is pretty strong. There is not much you can add to this \"character.\" On a side note, while I think he is incredible, I just wish viewers focus more on the other characters too.\nEven though most episodes have something I dislike, overall, the pros outmatch them depending on which episode you are watching. I definitely recommend it, maybe not for conventional reasons though. I value entertainment by measuring what values and virtues it tries to convey. I love this anime because it conveys a lot of them.\nP.S.: Pardon me if I have done terrible grammar mistakes. My native language is Spanish, therefore I am not that proficient in English. Can you comment on this thing? I am kind of new here... anyways, I would like to know your thoughts on my review and on the anime. Thanks for reading!\n"},

This show kept me interested from the get-go. The story was simply amazing. The creators made it relatable, action-packed (some of the coolest action I've seen), humorous, and emotional.

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    ***THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW***\nIt is an overused phrase but it fits this show so well; you have no idea what you are getting yourself into with Gurren Lagann. I for so long tried to understand the support and hype behind the series. I wanted to believe in this mystical, unicorn present from the fabled studio Gainax. It pushed me to try to watch the show over and over and over again. I had failed to finish the series nine times and was ready to give up on it completely. Luckily I have a group of peers that pushed me to get past the\n          \n        first chunk of episodes (which is what was holding me back) and boy am I glad I got to the meat of this series. \nStory: 2.7/10\nSo here's the thing; if you dislike it when shows/films pull shit out of their ass to make sense of something (the Deus Ex Machina plot device) then you are going to hate Gurren Lagann. This normally bugs me but given what the show is, I was able to level out my suspension of disbelief. The show just piles more and more mombo jumbo especially in the final episodes. It is however these final episodes (and honestly the whole second half of the show) that really hooked me. Hell we (our watching group) watched the last twelve or so episodes in one sitting. The flow of the episodes continuously rose in hype and suspension to a point where universes became weapons. It was quite the spectacle.\nAll of this however does not save the show from its horrid start. Like I mentioned in the first paragraph it took me ten tries to actually finish the show. Nine of those tries had me dropping the show after either episode three, four, or five. The problem I was having was finding a reason to care about the cast. I loved the characters (really meaningful character designs) but the plot was so centered around something that wasn't grabbing me. It wasn't until later on (I think around episode six or seven) that I finally got attached to what the humans were trying to accomplish. The start, middle, and end are all important and to have such a horrid start really makes me sad. The middle and end are a mess storytelling wise but you are not really watching this for a cohesive narrative. \nArt/Animation: 10/10\nThe general art direction in this show is astounding. Every aspect of it is perfection. The color design matches every emotion, tone, and character trait. The character designs are both attractive and has meaning for each character. Their personality screams out from their designs and dialogue. The scenery (both early on and in the future stuff) is so well done. The desert feels like a barren wasteland and the future city/space stuff feels grounded yet mystical at the same time. Everything about the art is just so fantastic. It's been awhile since I've enjoyed such masterful art work (can see the studio Trigger screaming from this show).\nAnimation is just as impressive as the artwork. The scenes that need the expressive movement absolutely has it. The important action shots are so beautifully done especially the shots in the ending 8 or so episodes. Like holy fuck the line art is insane. Speedlines everywhere. \nSound: 9/10\nWhat impressed me the most about the sound design for this show were the miscellaneous noises. How the robots expressed themselves via sounds, how the characters moved around, the city sounds, the noises attacks would make both on the ground and in the super all-out robot battles, all of these environmental sounds just fit in so well. The music was quite fitting though some of the pieces got overused towards the end (loved the OP too). The voice actors did a very good job though I really detest the whiny MC trait both in this show and in others. Simon was absolutely getting on my nerves in the starting episodes. Everyone else (and Simon after the sixth or so episode) however did a really good job. I quite liked Nia's VA the most because of how well she was able to bring out Nia's innocence.\nCharacters: 8/10\nThe characters just work so well with each other. The bromances, the friendships, the bickering, it all comes together for a great time. There were so many scenes that were carried by physical humor and it was possible due to how tight-nit the cast was. My favorite friendship comes towards the end of the show between Simon and a previous “bad guy”. The way they bonded was very enjoyable to watch. Also the growing closeness of Simon and Nia was really cute. \nOverall: 7.4/10\nThis show really provided a unique experience for me. Never have I tried so hard to get into a series. I wanted to experience the greatness that everyone else on the internet had apparently experienced. I know understand what they saw in this show. I felt that jolt of greatness that I had read in so many reviews, I felt that feeling that BestGuyEver (Nate) described over and over again in his video series. I get it. I think this is a show that every anime watcher should get around to trying out. I also think you should finish it. Yes I too have a stern drop rule (the start is as important as the middle and end) but the middle and ending really are galaxies ahead of the start of the show. Give this show a real shot and you might just lose some good sleep because of it. \nEnjoyment: 7/10\n        "},

However, I am an avid scifi and fantasy books reader and watch most of the blockbuster movies in the genre. I have to say that I haven't watched a story as good as this one. The Deathstalker novels by Simon R. Green come close, but they lack the boyish feel of innocence which this anime has, despite its many tragic moments.\nI fell in love with the characters.

He is much like Naruto except less bullied and alienated. The nice thing is he is so average that everyone can relate like super basic character yet they made him uber. The main character seems like it is is his older friend who he rides with but his older friend believes he is the main guy.\n          \n        The older guy says \"You don't have to believe in yourself, believe in me that believes in you\". I will never forget this for the message. Anyway the story is about a kid who lives in a village that just drills lower and lower in to the planet. The boy dreams of going up saying their is a surface. He finds a mystical spiral necklace while drilling and a robot you can ride. He is older friend also agrees their is a surface and his father has been there and is waiting for him. The village thinks the two crazy and doesn't support their ideas. One day mecha from the surface crash down into the village and the boy uses his new robot and friend to fight off the creature as well as a girl who landed in with the creatures but is fighting against them. The 3 then goto the surface to take it back and they go on a crazy adventure to take back the planet. Sounds like a basic story for the most part but towards the very end it picks up a lot.   \nPros:\nLots of inspirational quotes. \"With this drill I shall pierce the heavens!\" So much fun to watch. He is a hero who is super basic yet you can really believe in and fall in love with. The audience can envision themselves in the character. \nCons:\nKinda of really slow paced.

Do not expect edge of your seat actions. The fighting scenes were pretty bad.

The relationship between Simon and Kamina is heartwarming considering it isn't confirmed whether or not he's his brother or not. (I did learn a new Japanese word from Simon, you can probably guess what it is.) Though many of the side characters aren't really don't get as much development. You really cheer on for all these characters like I did once when I watched this. OUT LOUD\nFINAL VERDICT\nThere's something in this anime for anyone. If you haven't watched it, drop everything, watch from episode one and see how satisfied you are when the final episode closes\n9/10\nNot a masterpiece, but entertains until the very end\nRECOMMENDATION: VERY HIGH\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Gurren Lagann is one of the few series I have ever watched that will forever be engraved into my entire being. Every fiber of my soul has been affected by this series. That's how great it is. People who haven't seen this series don't understand why this anime has such high praise and such a faithful following.\nThe first episode I popped on I felt like it would be a fairly generic anime. For the most part it was, it wasn't until a few episodes in that I could tell this was going to be something special.\n-Story-\nThe story itself progresses at almost the perfect pace. Any\n          \n        slow portions in the series are made for information or emotional boost. The rapid progression through some parts made it flow naturally instead of downtime taking away from the story.\n-Art-\nThe actions scenes are smooth and impressive. The character designs are pleasant and appealing. The level of animation quality is highly impressive. Throughout the whole series, whenever the scenery changes, you feel at awe at the level of detail.\n-Sound-\nThe soundtrack for this series is probably one of my all time favorites. When it comes to music and soundtracks for an anime, the music should be able to emphasize the feeling of the current situation. In sad scenes, the music stabs your heart, in action scenes it makes you wanna take up a weapon and fight. There was never a moment where I skipped through the opening theme.\n-Characters-\nTo make characters that people truly love, you either make them easy to relate to or make it so everyone wants to be just like them. Most if not all the characters in this series were just that. There was either so much badassery or so much empathy that if you can say you only liked less than five characters in this series, you have to be lying.\n-Enjoyment-\nI've watched this series several times over already. No matter how many times I watch it, the sad parts make me sad, the happy parts make me happy, the climax is always exciting. This is one of the few series I have watched that will remain forever a part of me.\n-Overall-\nIn all honesty I feel as if it should be a crime to have never watched this series. If you haven't watched it you are missing out on easily one of the greatest series of all time. That being said, I'll end this review so you can be on your merry way to watching it.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    A few months ago, I hit a little bit of a lull with anime. Nothing that was getting put out at the time really interested me, and I couldn't find anything among the classics to get me back into the medium. I really was just going through the motions at that point, just catching the new episodes of the series that were airing at the time, but not really doing much on the side. A friend of mine, in passing, recommended that I take a look at Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. I was skeptical at first, because the mech genre had not been something that\n          \n        was particularly interesting to me at that point, especially with all the buzz that I had heard about it, some good, but mostly bad.\nI went into the show with lower expectations than I normally would, but about the time in the first episode when one of the two main characters, Kamina, was introduced (AKA, about five minutes into the episode after Simon finished his monologue) I was hooked. \nMyAnimeList has very nicely laid out each of the categories that a review should cover at the top of the screen for me, so we'll start there.\nIn terms of the story, I found the anime to be extremely fast-paced and it always kept the viewer guessing. A few twists down the road ranged from gut-wrenching moments of disbelief, and tearful moments of happiness and triumph. \nHowever, it wasn't perfect. A few episodes into the second cour, if I'm using that term correctly, the story seems to focus more on a power struggle between a few of the main characters. Without spoiling anything, the events that transpire just felt very alien to the series, and it almost seemed as if the series had gotten a new writer who had felt that the series was too light and happy, and wanted to add some angst or something. I dunno. For those of you who have seen the dub of Code Geass, though, these few episodes should provide some inside humor as well. I'll speak more to the dub later.\nOverall, the story was an enjoyable, fast-paced, and over the top tale with a few twists to keep the audience guessing, but was bogged down for a couple episodes as the series tried to get back to its roots after the first climax. I give it a 9/10\nAs for the art, the show was animated with a style that I don't see too often. It wasn't particularly realistic, with some proportions and character designs that were obviously there for eye candy (Hello, Yoko), others that looked just comical, and others that just looked strange altogether.\nAs for comparisons to other anime to get you an idea of what I'm talking to, the animation of Kill la Kill, and the movie Redline come to mind. The action scenes were colorful and vibrant, and the gunmen are very well detailed as well. The only blemish on this otherwise beautiful show is the fourth episode of the series. Apparently, a guest animator and director named Osamu Kobayashi, directed the episode and used a different style of animation. Since the release, the animation of said episode has been almost universally panned by critics across the globe. This includes myself. The animation just seemed off and very strange altogether, and this was especially disappointing, due to the events in the episode.\nOverall, the animation was really a treat for the eyes. All the action was fluid and the characters, although goofy at times, fit the overall tone of the anime. What I mean by this specifically, is that if you were to take the character designs of TTGL and put them into a show such as Attack on Titan, it wouldn't work at all. But, due to the absurd nature of the show, absurd character designs fit right in. Overall, due to a blemish in episode four, but the rest of the series being very well animated, I give a 9/10.\nFor sound, I'll be speaking both about the soundtrack and the dub. Although fitting for the anime, was somewhat disappointing to me in that aside from two tracks, I'm yet to find any piece of music in the anime that I can listen to on its own. And with a large soundtrack like TTGL's, this is somewhat disappointing. However, this does not impact my enjoyment of the music in the show, and thus cannot detract from my overall opinion thereof. As I said earlier, the soundtrack works very well within the show with the very upbeat and sometimes strange tracks fitting in nicely with the over-the-top and bizarre happenings of the characters. But where the soundtrack truly shines is in the scenes in which the anime takes a slightly darker tone, specifically in the battle scenes. Of all these tracks, Libera Me From Hell is a personal favorite, as it conveys a very uplifting message in a very strange way, which is indicative of the nature of the show. I mean, opera over rap? What?\nThe dub is great. There are very few shows that I'll watch through a second time, merely to hear some of my favorite voice actors. Simon is done my Yuri Lowenthal. His voice, although fitting, couldn't stop me from bursting into laughter almost every time he got serious, due to his uncanny resemblance to Suzaku Kururugi, the main \"antagonist\" of Code Geass. This is due, of course, to the two characters sharing one voice actor. Michelle Ruff does a very good job conveying both the carefree, jolly side of Yoko, and the sometimes Tsundere-like angry side of her simultaneously, and the other characters are also done well by their respective actors. Overall, a great soundtrack and a fantastic dub, 10/10, already did watch again.\nAnd then there's the all-important enjoyment factor. This anime was downright hilarious and action-packed at the same time. Each character had their own distinct voice and message to show the audience, and the intertwining of those voices and storylines was done very well and made for an extremely enjoyable experience. The overall message of the show impacted me as well. The whole \"You can accomplish anything\" slogan that we hear so frequently today is told in a light that not only presents another seemingly impossible task each time the previous one is completed, but does it in a way that is not too cliche to not work, yet just cliche enough to be easily understood as a basic value of the show. Because of all these things, this show was an extremely enjoyable and emotional experience. 10/10\nOverall, the show is amazing. Stellar animation with colorful characters, each with their own personality, combined with a fitting soundtrack makes for a great overall experience. I give this anime a full recommendation to anyone who's looking for something fun and fast-paced to get them through some boredom. If you liked Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, check out Kill La Kill, which boasts a very similar animation style, sountrack, and over-the-top nature. Oh, and it shares higher-ups with TTGL, so that may have influenced it. Just a bit.\nHappy watching,\n-Xenon\n        "},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    Gurren Lagann is one of the more “artistic” anime series.  The animations help to bring some intensity to the series.  The plot is decently constructed but may be a bit confusing at times; due to odd timeline placement and a confusing setting.  Even after watching the series one is left clueless to whether the setting is supposed to.  A time line is given throughout the show but does not seem to always match up with character development/growth.  Regardless of the timeline issues the character development is solid; plenty of comic relief is provided throughout the series: often at the expense\n          \n        of Yoko’s boobs, or Leeron.  Dialogue through the show is overly “epic” but this is clearly done on purpose and provides for some extra amusement.  The voice acting is some of the best around; Leeron’s voice is played especially well.  Gurren Lagann is a solid series and worth watching if you are looking for a new series to watch. \n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    When you think Mecha anime you think of horrible story and characters and mediocre everything but with Gurren Lagann its a whole new plane of anime. I was a little hesitant on watching this but as soon as  started watching it, I was hooked on it until the end.\nStory 10/10\nNow there are two arcs to the story in total. The first last from episode 1-16 and the second arc is every episode after. The first arc tells the story of Team Gurren  attempts to defeat the Spiral King which gives you a little taste of what will lie within the second arc. Just\n          \n        the way the anime presents it story line makes you feel so satisfied when the power of the drill is used its just so damn epic. The story couldn't get any better than what this told.\nArt 9/10\nThis is a very bright anime. Wonderful display of vibrant colors and downright amazing animating scheme. Characters and mecha's were made to be pretty rememorable for future watch. I almost everything about the designs for this show.\nSound 10/10\nThe OST for this show could not be more fitting for such an epic anime  OP and ED got me real hyped to watch this show even more and who could forget Row Row Fight the Power. I watched in English Dub so not sure how the sub will compare but the voice acting was pretty rich for this series.\nCharacters 9/10\nNow there was a few characters I did not really like such as Kamina and Leeron but I gotta say the were all so fucking badass and have some good quotes. The  series first arc helped build on the character development going into the second arc. Most of the characters developed from what Kamina did in the anime as a  reckless badass but always keep a fighting spirit. The characters taught me to always believe in yourself and kick logic out and do the impossible which in my mind couldn't have been more deeply demonstrated by this any other show.\nOverall 9/10\nI really loved this show and every moment about it and can't wait to watch maybe the movies or Parallel Works. If your one for total badassery, gigantic mecha's clashing heads, and heart warming morals than this show is right for you. Even if none of this applies this is still a must watch for any group and I highly recommend it to anyone out there.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I gotta admit, I myself was never a big fan of mecha animes in the past, but from all the recommendations from other people that had watched it, and from the artwork, I felt that this was an anime that just couldn't suck. So I decided to give it a shot and watch it. And this baby even blew my already high expectations. Why is this such a fest of awesomeness, you ask? Well, where do I begin?\nAs for the story, I can say that it is extremely simple. The performance of this, however, is what makes it so awesome. As soon as the main\n          \n        characters reach the surface, everything keeps getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger. And yet the heroes can manage to overcome any of these by sheer willpower. In fact, the ganmen used by the protagonists wouldn't even work if without willpower. The villains have strong motivations to do what they do, while the heroes have a damn good reason to oppose them. In fact, the heroes even go so far as to destroy whatever motivated the villains to do what they did in the first place. All with a huge amount of testosterone slammed in to make it even more awesome.\nAs for the art direction, I say it very raw and rough, but that is what makes it fit so well with the story of the anime. Especially in the most intense scenes. One can really see how it really goes to the extreme in these moments, reallyn capturing the awesomeness of said scenes. I can truly say this is the most raw art styles I have seen in any anime to date. That is part of why it stands out so well to many other animes.\nAs for sound, I really think the soundtrack is really diverse. The opening song got stuck on my head immediately after I heard it for the first time. I swear, they went over the top to make sure the music didn't get played too often, a good thing I really do appreciate. It is rare to hear a song played more than once in an episode, which means that a song doesn't get too repetitive after a while. And with such a diverse soundtrack, I must say it is kinda obvious. The tunes vary from rock to rap to a little bit of anything, really. That makes the musical score pretty much appealing to any taste.\nThe amount of characters is huge. Most are part of the Dai-Gurren Brigade, and I must say many of the characters feel like they are there to make the Brigade feel as big as it is supposed to be. Many of these characters have just about as much focus to make interesting side characters and comical relief, but they do feel like they have their parts in the anime. The main character, Simon, while starting out as a bit of a shy dog looking up to his adopted brother, Kamina, is a true example of a man who takes a grade in manliness and willpower and evolves beyond the impossible to such a degree that he himself becomes unstoppable. And he still doesn't beat Kamina, the true beacon of awesomeness in the series. Believe me when I say that you'll want those shades when you have watched this series. As no series would be complete without some female flesh, the series has two main female characters, Yoko and Nia, action girl and love interest respectively. To not get into spoilers,  I can only say that Nia herself is a pretty sad character in my opinion. Yoko, however, feels more like a major link in the brigade, acting more like the team's major action girl, and a secondary leader of the crew for large parts of the anime. The villains themselves are pretty awesome. At least the major ones. I especially like Viral in this regard due to him being a major rival for the main chararacter, and is probably one of the most interesting of the villains, seconded only by Lord Genome, who in himself is an extremely manly example of manlyness found in the villains. I would like to discuss some more of the major characters in this anime, but I think I will stop here to get on with the rest of the review.\nI really enjoyed this anime. It might be a bit too early to talk about it in a more criticizing manner for me, but this is really the kind of anime you want to watch if you want to get an overdose of manliness. I really was satisfied pretty much non-stop while watching this, and it had a good share of manly tears, screams of awesomeness, and motivational kicks. I can truly say, this is a masterpiece. Maybe there are better animes aout there, but damn, I don't think you can find anyone that's more awesome, because this is awesomeness incarnate.\n        "},

It drives to make 'the impossible POSSIBLE!' as quoted by one of the main characters. Though the story was incredibly simple, and the art was very reminiscent of Furi Curi, the show itself  NEVER failed to engage me in a gripping experience. It deliverers a wonderful blend of humor, drama, and action all in one. I don't really know how else to describe it, except that it never fails to give me this warm feeling inside as though nothing is out of reach if you strive for it and 'believe\n          \n        in you who believes in yourself.'

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    ::::Overall 9/10::::\n\nI bet most of you have heard about TTGL in one way or another, but here&rsquo;s my view of the anime:\nStory: The young boy Simon and his &ldquo;aniki&rdquo; Kamina lives in a village underground, but dreams about seeing the sky and live on the surface. They meet new friends and together with them they create Gurren Brigade, a force against the beastmen who rules earth. \nAfter half of the series have passed, there is a time leap, seven years ahead, and the characters have developed when it&rsquo;s time to meet humanity&rsquo;s greatest treat. \nArt: They know about their special effects, the anime has great\n          \n        colours but I&rsquo;m simply not found of how they draw the characters. Even though I dislike them, they seem to fit in rather well with the whole style of TTGL.\nSound: I can&rsquo;t complain about the seiyuus, but none of them were extraordinary and stood out. They had the same opening during the whole series (but with a different animation after the time leap) and two endings. None of them something special. The BGM was in one word terrible. In the last epic battle they played a remix of opera and rap. Not a success, at least in my opinion. \nCharacters: Sure, they get caught in a clich&eacute; or two but they succeed with developing the characters during the series. They are affected by what is happening: some dies and some fall in love just to mention some things. And in some way, the interplay between the characters is logical most of the time.\nEnjoyment: It swung between an eight and a nine during the time I watched the anime, but at last I decided up on a nine. I enjoyed the series, even if there were a few things I would like to change, but that&rsquo;s how it uses to be when I watch an anime. Unfortunately, the ending was worse than the rest of the series."},

The plot is revolting as the series procceeds and the story arcs are very interesting  but still you will not watch this anime if you want a serius plot as a lot of ridiculus staff are going on in there. But one of the most epic quoutes that this show has is; '' reject common sense to make the impossible possible'' so you have probably understood what this is alll about. Also, at first\n          \n        this anime may look silly and a little bit boring but if you bare with it untill episode 8 (where a great plot twist happens) after that the anime gets serius and later a little bit more dark.\nArt: Just AMAZING. The animation is beautifull and the fighting scenes are perfect. I loved it.\nSound: The music is really good. Especially the OST's of this show. The opening was good but a little bit boring in my oppinion. I was surprised with the endings as they were all really good. Especially the second one was really catchy. All the voice actors did a remarkable job especially Simon's and Kamina's voice actors.\nCharacter: The main reason to watch the anime. They are all very loveable and you simply can't hate ayone. Simon the protagonist is going through a great evolution trough the series and same goes also with the other characters. The only reason I put an 8 is because some of the characters like Lordgenome's the first main villain aren't  explained very clear.\nEnjoyment: If anything else I really enjoyed this anime. Even though I got a little bored of it with the first episodes when the storyline became solid it just got me really hooked.\nOverall: YOU SHOULD DEFINETLY WATCH THS ANIME. If you are looking for an anime with not a very serious plot, with badass characters who laugh at the sight of death and generally an anime that you will have a great time with it the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is for you.\n"},

It is by far one of the best in existence, and I don't think I could list all the reasons why it was so great in even one thousand pages of writing.  I will attempt to review it as a whole, and describe just how great of an anime Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is.\nStory: This is one of the high points in the entire series, and I must say, it was done amazingly well.  It connects at all the right points, and it truly grips you as you watch.  You'll\n          \n        find that Gurren Lagann is easily able to keep you watching well into the break of dawn.  It's truly mind-boggling how gripping this anime becomes after the first few episodes.\nArt: A fantastic blend of visual effects and extremely detailed characters and mechas make the art of this series a sure-fire win.  The lights and explosions that the action scenes of this series deliver are just out of this world, and careful attention was given to each and every character in this anime.  The art style is amazing in all respects, and I personally think that the Gurren Lagann's design is ingenius.\nSound: Suprisingly, I loved the music for this series.  It was catchy and epic a the same time, and it completely fit the series as a whole, especially towards the finale of the last episode.  The music is certainly iPod worthy in every way.\nCharacter: Another point where the series shines.  Character development is at it's maximum here, and it's clear that every character does in fact change throughout the entire anime's run.  Simon's character begins as timid and shy digger boy, but slowly grows up and in fact becomes a mirror of the very person he wanted to emulate the entire time.  I would tell you who, but you need to watch it and see for yourself.\nEnjoyment: I found myself spending hours watching this series in blocks, so the enjoyment value is defintiely up there.  This is also DVD-worthy, and I could definitely go through this series again, as it was just fantastic and magnificent the first time around.\nOverall: All in all, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann earns a perfect 10/10 score.  It is a must-watch, in fact, it goes beyond just simple anime.  It is a truly amazing tale of one man searching for his destiny, and it is beautifully imagined and executed.

Highly developed characters and great animation are certainly nice, but they don't matter it the show isn't enjoyable. \nLuckily, \"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\" is the kind of show that DOES have great characters, animation, and much more, while still being an exciting and entertaining watch all the way through. Here is my review.\nStory: \nI'll keep plot description short here, but basically the story revolves around a wimpy and timid 14 year old boy named Simon, and his \"soul brother\", the loud and over the top\n          \n        Kamina living in an underground shelter, the same kind of shelter humanity has lived in for years. One day they get the chance to go the surface, where they form a resistance to defeat the oppressive gunman forces trying to keep humanity suppressed.\nAlong the way many new characters are introduced, and they all grow in some way throughout the show. The story in this series is fast moving, hardly ever giving you time to catch your breath before it keeps moving. In short, it's a vicious romp, through endlessly creative battles, with an incredible feel of just plain \"awesome\" coursing through it the whole time, while also occasionally stopping to show you a sadder, more serious side of things, all with a coming of age undertone to it.\nThe story is one the best parts of Gurren Lagann, always offering new situations and playing on all of your emotions at just the right time. Just when it feels like the endless battles may get repetitive, it hits you with something tear jerking, but never without having something awesome waiting for you at the end of the tunnel. \nThere are only two parts when the story slows down, and even these have their silver linings. The story does slow down at one point, offering less over the top fun that was given prior, but the story itself does get a bit more interesting. Also, at the end of the show there are some things that are completely inaccurate \"laws of science\" wise, but many great moments would not be possible without these things.\nAnd unlike some shows, you don't have to worry about a confusing or unsatisfying ending for this one. Everything comes together in the end while also providing a shocking twist, providing for a fulfilling, bittersweet ending that will be sure to stick with you.\nArt:\nTo put it simply, the animation in Gurren Lagann is fantastic. Quality control is never an issue as Gainax is infamous for, and every character, robot, and location looks crisp and unique. The style of animation isn't anything groundbreaking like, say \"Gankutsuou\" (another show worth watching), but it is pleasing to the eyes.\nThere is one episode, where the animation falters though, episode 5. This was done intentionally by Gainax to parody older shows where animation quality would randomly fluctuate between episodes. It was admittedly an interesting idea, although it just didn't turn out well in the end.\nSound:\nFrom music to other sound effects, Gurren Lagann hits home. From the beautifully made opening theme, to the epic, blood pumping battle soundtracks, all the music hits home for the given moment, even including some quieter, more subdued tracks, and another, vocalized song that plays during some of the more important moments.\nSound effects work just as well as the music, and while there aren't any particularly memorable sound effects, they all work just fine, and the amazing music more than makes up for the lack of anything special here.\nI can't speak for the Japanese seiyuu, but I can assure the the English dub works very well for the series, and all of the voices fit the characters perfectly, especially the main character, Simon.\nCharacters:\nAh, the characters. There are many, many things I could say about the characters in Gurren Lagann, but I'll keep things simple. There are 4 \"main\" characters in this show, and each one of them is unique and enjoyable to watch. They all change and grow over the course of the show, and by the end you really will have made an attachment to them.\nOther than them there are roughly 10-12 other side characters in the show, some of them more important than others. The great thing though is that even if the character doesn't seem important at first, by the end of the series, every character will have gotten the spotlight at least once, and you will go out of the show remembering most of them.\nEnjoyment:\nAs I said at the beginning of this review, a show is all about how enjoyable it it, and quite frankly Gurren Lagann is the most purely entertaining anime I have ever seen. It's not always though provoking or deep and complex, but it has great, over the top and epic mecha action, interesting and well developed characters, high quality animation, and an epic soundtrack to go along with it.\nIt would be easy to make a list of top five moments in an anime, but for Gurren Lagann I could make a top five list for every episode, and I would probably still have trouble deciding what would make the cut. I think that's just a testament to how great this show is. The story does slightly falter at some points, and there is one instance where the art is lacking, but those parts wouldn't even be noticeable if everything wasn't near perfect at every other moment, which is why I'm still going to give this show an overall rating of 10 out of 10.\nOverall: 10/10, Perfect\n        "},

One that exceeded my expectations like no other show has, and one that excels at almost everything it tried.\nI went in expecting a show similar to Kill la Kill, and what I got clearly surpasses it by a shot so long it could reach the heavens. It may not be the most original anime ever, but it is definitely one of the most unique.\nStory: The story isn't much as it is. It starts as a very generic \"freedom\" story\n          \n        (as I like to call it), and increases in intensity until the very end, but the thing that makes this section great is the way the plot unfolds. Every episode is a fast-paced thrill ride that never stops, and keeps bombarding the viewer with crazy battle scenes and few, but great plot twists.\nArt: Excluding episode 4, the animation in GL is gorgeous. The mechs and characters look very good, and the energy in every frame is incredibly potent. It's very flashy and over-the-top, which works to the anime's favor.\nSound: First, the soundtrack: it's simply glorious. As I listen to them while writing this, I notice the orchestral songs are filled with outstanding emotion. The opening and endings are very well chosen as well; they end up growing on you.\nThe seiyuus also do an amazing job at conveying the necessary power or sadness of the characters. Everything feels natural, and that's what counts.\nCharacters: I found myself loving almost every single one of these characters. There was only one that I strongly disliked, and that was Nia. I won't go into detail here, but let's just say she was a one-dimensional, walking plot device. Even still, she wasn't enough to bring the entire cast down.\nEnjoyment: Only watching one episode of this show is an experience. The mix of insanity, comedy and action of this show has to be seen to be believed.\nOverall, Gurren Lagann is a show I can recommend to anyone without a second thought. No words can properly express how much I love it. Even if you're not a fan of mecha anime, this is an anime no one can afford to miss.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Whether you like the genre or not, the mecha genre will forever be associated with the medium of anime, featuring revolutionary series such as the Gundam franchise and Neon Genesis Evangelion. Another anime that redefines the genre is 2007's Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. After putting this series off for two years, I finally managed to finish watching it, and it was well worth the wait.\nThe story of Gurren Lagann was inspired by the giant robot shows of long ago. Despite that, the show takes concepts and themes that avid fans of the genre know well and executes them in ways that make them seem fresh\n          \n        and new. This almost makes it seem like you're being introduced to the mecha genre all over again. I'd also like to point out that the anime is divided up into two halves, making it seem like you're watching two different anime. The first half of the series sets everything up for the second half, which provides most of the substance for the story. Those halves eventually connect with each other through various scenes, with the second half clearing up any plotholes that may have been brought up in the first half. This excuses the thinness of the first half's plot as the story progresses. Speaking of which, the story isn't without its flaws. Since the series is based on old school mecha anime, it occasionally borrows chiches and recycled plot points from said genre (i.e. save the universe, save the hero's girlfriend, transforming robots, etc). Even with the way the story is executed, these aspects of the plot can't be avoided by those that are well-acquainted with the genre. The series also makes plenty of use of drills as symbols to help move the story along, such as going from the main character's lowly tool as a digger to an object of strength and hope as well as coupling with the series' recurring theme of history repeating itself. Gurren Lagann may not have the strongest plot, but for an anime like this with a lot more things going on, a light story is decent enough.\nIf Gurren Lagann's story isn't strong enough to stand on its own, then the events of the series have no other choice than to be supported on the shoulders of the characters. I don't think I've seen a more likable cast of characters in an anime. Just like the story of the series, the characters of Gurren Lagann are based on previous character archetypes seen in previous mecha and GAINAX anime: the busty female lead, the shy hero, the animal sidekick, etc. These archetypes aren't exactly played straight, proving that there is more to this anime than meets the eye. The character development doesn't really start until after a devastating turn of events in the series. It's then that these characters really start to change. The bashful hero gains the spirit of a lion, the female gunslinger acts as an older sister to the cast, and so on. Even Nia, a character who appears later on in the series' first half, has the makings of a Mary Sue character but defies that character trope by being a total airhead. Like I said earlier, the second half of the series is like a different anime, down to the characters that you come to know during the first 16 episodes. These character changes may cause you to like certain characters that you didn't like before and vice versa. The characters may not be realistic or complex, but they fit nicely in Gurren Lagann's energetic world. They're the heart of the show, the kinds of heroes you might have looked up to as children, and the ones that make the show as lively as it is. Don't be surprised if you find yourselves cheering for them until the end.\nThe animation in Gurren Lagann is nothing short of outstanding. GAINAX has proven once again that they are the go-to studio for producing high budget mecha anime. The epic feel of the show comes from the high production quality of the animation. The buildings and the rocky terrains don't feel like drawings done on paper, but a living, breathing world that the show takes place in. The battles that take place every few episodes or so are so well-choreographed that they all feel like the climatic battles that take place in every mecha series. The final battle, however, is an event of universal proportions. Despite this show being an animated work of fiction, the sheer scale of this battle is overwhelmingly large, and it is as epic and grandiose as everyone says it is. The series even switches art styles every now and then to set the mood for certain scenes. These shifts may seem random, but they're done for the sake of the story. The art style in general is very cartoony. With a show as ignorant to logic and reasoning as this, that kind of style might be the only way to capture the events of the series. The character designs couldn't be more representative of what the anime style is, but they're so distinct that you can describe a certain character to someone based on appearance and that person could probably guess who that character is. The robots also have interesting designs themselves and often represent the kind of people piloting them. In short, if you ignore the wart that is episode 4, the animation in Gurren Lagann is flawless.\nIwasaki Taku has to be the most overrated anime composer within the last decade. With that said, I find the Gurren Lagann soundtrack to be highly overrated and overpraised. I admire the soundtrack's variety, but the majority of the tracks featured in the show are forgettable. Whatever few gems can be found on the soundtrack truly shine, such as the triumphant \"Pierce the Heavens with Your XXX\". Viral's theme sounds very much like a scrapped Linkin Park song. It's interesting at first, given that the band's music is often used in AMVs, but it gets annoying very quickly. The opening and ending themes for the show also grow stale very quickly. \"Sora-Iro Days\" eventually reveals itself to be a dime-a-dozen mecha anime theme song and the ending themes aren't to my liking, since I'm not all that into punk rock music. Although the soundtrack is just o.k. on its own, the music succeeds in highlighting the series' more important events.\nHaving only viewed Gurren Lagann in Japanese with English subtitles, I found the voice acting to be generic and just passable. There were several stand-out performances scattered across the series, but nothing really worth noting. Seeing as how I'm used to women voicing shy young boys, I was a bit surprised to hear Kakihara Tetsuya voice Simon in both parts of the series. He managed to give two different performances while adding subtle details to ensure that they were both the same character. I was also expecting Nia's voice to be extremely high-pitched, but it was soft and pleasant, a nice change of pace from all the other \"moe\" characters I'm used to watching. One problem that I did find with the voice acting is that the constant repetition of catchphrases helped in no way to develop the characters or advance the plot. It was as if the writers had various cases of Writer's Block and decided to stick some catchphrases in if they couldn't think of ways to continue the story. The phrases made their impacts the first 3 times they were said; I really didn't need to hear the words \"Who the hell do you think I am?!\" 5 more times. The audio aspect of the show was passable at best.\nGurren Lagann may be one of the best anime epics to come out in recent memory, but saying that it'll stand the test of time like Evangelion and Gundam may be a bit of a stretch. It may not be as huge of a hit in 5 years as it is now, but it does have the makings of a truly memorable anime. If you're planning on jumping into this show, be prepared to throw any sort of real world logic out the window. That doesn't exist in the world of Gurren Lagann, and that's what makes the show as fun as it is. If you want to witness a large-scale anime experience, the key word being \"experience\", then I recommend this anime.\n        "},

It is epic because every episode of the series introduces something new and kicks it up a notch. The pace may be a little fast for some, but it does not ruin the story that it tells.

That it's simple storyline leaves it flawed and wanting.\nI...disagree. It's true that it has a simple storyline, and it does indeed have some superbly animated action sequences (barring, of course, the infamous episode 4). \nBut ultimately, Gurren Lagann isn't trying to weave deep, complicated storyline - rather then deconstructing something, or making a psychological statement, it takes the tried and true formula of the generic Shonen storyline, and brings it to an entirely new level by focusing not on the action - though it does\n          \n        have great fighting scenes - but on the characters. When you look at Naruto or Goku, they're basically the same in personality as they were in the beginning. In Gurren Lagann... this is not so.\nThe entire story revolves around Simon, and his development as a character. Initially, he is rather similar in personality to Shinji Ikari - hesitant, scared, reluctant... but still willing to try. Gurren Lagann, however, mixes things up by introducing what seems like the epitome of the stereotypical Shonen hero in Kamina. Kamina is everything that Simon is not – brave, hot-blooded, strong, and…well, stupid. Not that Kamina isn’t intelligent, but he’s willing to set aside his intelligence in favor of whatever his manly spirit demands of him to do. Really, what else could you expect from a man who’s always spouting on about “kicking logic to the curb and doing the impossible?”. From a certain point of view, Kamina is a parody on what happens when you take a Shonen hero’s determination to do the right thing no matter what the odds to it’s logical conclusion… at least, that’s what it seemed at first.\nYou see, Gurren Lagann isn’t about Kamina. He certainly seemed to be the hero at first… but only at first. While I won’t go in depth, Kamina’s presence is what drives the show, but not as it’s protagonist. Kamina becomes something more than a man; an inspiration, an ideal.  Gurren Lagann revolves around Simon surpassing Kamina in every way, becoming everything that Kamina was… and even more. It’s the ultimate coming of age story, embracing clichés and making them fun again. The character development feels very organic and real, and it's easy to connect with the cast. The music is quite good - the famous \"Libera Me From Hell\" excluded, there are pieces that give an uplifting, inspiring feeling, pieces that feel very mischievous, and the music conveys what's going in the scenes very well. The story, simple as it is, is still compelling when combined wiht the characters. The animation is really quite nice, barring episode 4. \nAll in all, Gurren Lagann is, a very good anime.\nI don’t really know why I like Gurren Lagann so much. There isn’t any one answer, but the sheer passion and enjoyment you get out of watching it… there’s a reason why so many people loved it. \nIt comes down to this, in the end.\nGurren Lagann… it’s not a smart anime. It’s not something that’s logical, it’s not something deep. If you’re looking for something that waxes philosophically about the meaning of life, if you try to over analyze it… you probably won’t find what you’re looking for. Gurren Lagann is all about passion, and excitement, and feeling. You have to turn off your brain and feel with your heart. If you can do that, if you can just accept it for what it is? You’ll love it. "},

From beginning to end, each episode stands out as unique and none of them will bore you. Yes, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a series that every anime fan should watch, especially if it's your first time watching an anime series.\nStory: There are only two complaints in this section. The first one is how ridiculous the plot is. WHo would ever expect a miner who hasn't even seen the surface of the Earth to be the hero of the entire universe? The second complaint\n          \n        is the pacing. The very first episode, in the very first 5 episodes, the protagonist is able to create a whole army against an enemy that he only met about a week before making the army. Gee, that's kinda fast. However, even though I have two complaints, the series still works. The plot is so ridiculous, it actually makes it better. Who would want to see two series with the same plot? Also, the pacing cuts out a lot of unnecessary scenes or just boring scenes. So, even though I have complaints about the story, its still used in a good way\nArt: Unique. That's the only way to describe it. The artwork is colorful and the environments, are beautiful to look at. Also the design for Gurren Lagann was pretty sweet. Enough said, moving on.\nSound: The theme song is great. The voice acting is great with the exception of one character, Nia( she doesn't even sound like a girl. She sounds like a man trying to sound like a girl.) Arguably, the best voice actor of the series is Viral, which many of you might know him as Ikkaku in Bleach. Both Ikkaku and Viral have the same personality and therefore the director chose a wise decision to put the voice of Ikkaku on.\nCharacter: Every character in this series from the first time you meet them, you fall in love with. Each character has a different mind and personality so that each fo them will be memorable. Even Nia, whose voice I couldn't stand, as much as I disliked her, I did enjoy seeing her playing a major role in the second half of the series.\nOverall: If you aren't hyped up or if you are bored after seeing one episode of this series, you need to be slapped. From start to finish, this series kept me wanting another episode to watch after finishing the previous one. The art is great, the voice acting is top-notch, the characters are memorable, and even though it was ridiculous, the story was awesome. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann by all means should be watched by any anime fan out their. There is no one I know of that shouldn't see this series.\nOverall:9/10\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    After watching this anime, I can only say that fate is in place so it can be shattered by our hands.  The thought of trying even if we know it to be futile is what keeps us alive and all bound by a similar purpose. This concept is what drew me to Tengen Toppa in the first place. I'll go on a template of how they have the ratings set out. First, is the story:\nAt first, I was shocked at the depth of the show, for being a mecha as a primary base, it went about re-doing the mecha genre so that even people\n          \n        who dislike mechs could enjoy the series. Whereas the mecha oriented genre usually uses said items to move the plot of the show, Tengen relied heavily upon relationships, and the very nature of humans to survive, damned be the consequences. That type of a hook drags me in and doesn't let go. I don't know about you, but I've often felt like I wanted to shatter my own fate too.\nUsing the mechs they were able to accomplish what was though impossible: they broke fate itself. Yup, they shattered it like an expensive vase and ensured the survival of all human kind. Along the way, you grow engaged along with them, which is the mark of any halfway decent anime. You laugh with them, you cry when people die, and you want them to survive as badly as you want to help them. On this front, the show was a smashing success, and hence why my rating of a \"10\" as outstanding.\nThe art in the show was gritty, sub-part at best, animation. While they tried to pull of their own style, it kind of at times looks like the animators just got mad and threw their pencils at the storyboard. But this is also why the show was as good as I gave it. Even though my rating of a \"7\" on the art, it managed to pull it off and this show remains firmly at my #3 on my top five. it doesn't look too horrid, it doesn't look fantastic or \"Animated with Class\" as say death note, or speed grapher who did their style in a very highly refined medium. It was refreshing but like I said, at times sub-part at best.\nThe sound in the show is the same as the art, rating of 7. It's good, it's not bad. The opening and endings are suiting, whereas the actual in-anime music was lacking in spots. Sure, when the epic fight music came on, it didn't instill that \"oh man, SOMEONE'S going to get OWNED hard\" feeling that say DBZ brought to the table. But when it needed to be good, it was. Like whenever Kamina or Simon were doing their epic speeches, that music got me pumped. I guess you can't win them all.\nCharacters were awesome. You loved them, you cried as they died, you laughed at their antics. In this respect, this is why I rate it a solid \"8\". The other reason it did not achieve a  9 or 10 was simply they did not develop enough of their characters to a satisfactory point for me. People like Kittan ended up like clones of Kamina, and only a select few like Yoko and Simon grew at an outstanding rate. I also liked how Rossiu came to the forefront, and took on the aspects of the father that led his underground village. I found that fitting. But like I said, there were a lot of character and very few grew to be anything decent, but such is the problem with any anime that has tons of people in it.\nEnjoyment was a solid 10, there was in no way any episode in this series I disliked at all. Even the filler episode where they were at the beach, I felt like it just fit into the series as a whole, and gave that rounded-feeling to it. I usually dislike filler 100%, but it worked for a very rare change.\nOverall, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann was an epic ride of even more epic proportions (I mean come on, how can you get more epic then chucking galaxies as throwing stars?!) and the scale of the fights just shot up and up and up and never stopped. Sure, the anime started out slow, but once the Genome saga finished and the second part of the show started, it exploded onto the scene. This is why I solidly rate this show as a \"9\"\nIt's also the reason it's #3 like I said, on my all time top five list. I'd be hard pressed to kick this off the list anytime soon.

This show is ridiculous. I can’t even begin to explain the things this show does and gets away with in order to move the plot forward, and still expect you to take it seriously. And this starts early on too. I watched an animal lliterally rip his tail off in order to satiate the pilots' hunger and provide them with the energy they needed to pilot their respective mechas… and it worked. By the\n          \n        end of the series, the mechs grow and learn new attacks like Digimon, tromp all over the laws of physics, biology, time, and space, what have you, and you’re supposed to nod and say “yeah, seems about right.” \nTechnically, Gurren Lagann has a lot of great things going for it. The music is one of the most excellent aspects of the show. Several of the songs were written specifically for Gurren Lagann and they’re very catchy ((row! row! fight da powah!)). Design-wise, all the characters, the robots, and the villains are are varied and extremely colorful. I really, really like the visual style in the series. Very cartoon-y and over the top, but dynamic just like the show itself. In my opinion, most of the mechas look pretty silly, but I’ve got to give it credit; too many times mechs, Gundams, and Transformers, all look the same; here they’re all very original, and instantly recognizable, even if it looks like they’re not even remotely physically and mechanically sound.\nAnd while the robot fights are cool and all, and despite being utterly ridiculous, the series about so much more than that. At the forefront is the lead, Simon; originally shy, annoying, and afraid, Simon, with the help of his stronger and more competent friends, learns to man up and develops into quite the protagonist. His big bro, Kamina, serves as the brave, brash, and berating voice of inspiration—one part cool, one part sincerity, and three parts complete lunacy. All of us at one point or another have felt scared, or unworthy, or hopeless; when Kamina steps in and literally slaps the sense into Simon telling him to believe in himself, it’s as if he’s speaking directly to all of us. It’s Kamina that first unlocks the hidden potential in Simon. Yeah, he’s kind of a weenie in the beginning of the series, but he’s supposed to be. The point of the show is to watch how far he develops as a character from beginning to end as a symbol of the potential of the human soul and spirit to achieve anything. \nSo where Gurren Lagann manages to hook you, despite being completely implausible and repetitive, is with your emotions. Think you don’t care about this side character whose name you probably don’t remember? Guess what—they make you care. Sure, we watch for the cool robot battles and to see how the heroes will evolve in order to triumph, but like I said, it really appeals at times when Kamina speaks to us, when Yoko makes a new life for herself, or when Simon mans up and kicks ass. The show directly appeals to every person’s belief that anything is possible—their dreams, their inspirations—and the deepest, best, most whole-heartedly good center of human nature. Deep down, everybody wants to believe that they are capable of doing anything; Gurren Lagann began with a whiny nobody, and we got to watch him become a true, strong willed, self-sacrificing, hero. \nBut that’s the thing about this show—everything is developed exponentially—the characters, the plot, the mechs, the deus ex machina, and the true extent of human capabilities. In the same way the spirals around Simon’s dream begin small and tight, and expand outward, they symbolize the way every element of the series progresses. Simon began as a drill digger, and every arc of the story, he becomes something greater than he ever imagined he could be in the previous one. Unfortunately, he’s one of very few characters that get this treatment (the pig-mole is another one), but it doesn’t mean that their actions and emotions don’t strike us as genuine and again, put us right behind the team as they go in for their next epic battle.\nIt also pushes the plot as far over the top as it can go; the point is that we are capable of doing the impossible—it only seems ridiculous when our rational brains place these limitations on ourselves. That’s why you have to turn it off. Going into the show, watching Simon and Kamina explore the surface world for the first time and fight for the right to win it back, I had no  idea I’d end up where I did, and how emotional I would be when I got there. \nIt might sound as if the show is being manipulative, and it might be, but I never felt animosity toward it for making me care. You can just feel that everyone putting all their love and passion into this show really believes in their message—that we are capable of anything. And you can tell that they truly admire and wanted to pay homage to the classic mech shows they drew so much inspiration from. For those of us who grew up with 90’s mecha anime, it’s fun to catch the tips of the hat the series gives to the old Gundams or Evangelion ((I squee’d a little when I caught one straight from the last episode of G Gundam)). \nI said you have to go into this show with your brain turned off, and that’s mostly true. That being said, despite trampling all over science, and without giving anything away, along with human potential, there are overlaying themes tying in with “Biology” and Darwinian evolution. It was rather enjoyable for me as a pre-med nerd to catch the bio-related nuances, and I’d rewatch the series for no other reason than to find them all.\nMy only real issue with this show was the pacing. The series was 27 episodes long and roughly broken up into four story arcs (6-7 episodes long). This means it moves at breakneck speed, especially as the story becomes ungodly complicated. Given, if you look at the genre for the series, its a mecha action adventure, it’s also a drama, a romance, a comedy, it has a lot to fit in in its short series length. Again, it’s not a huge deal as I don’t like it when my anime run forever, and it also adds to the madness and greatness of the show.\n        "},

And I think this anime after watching it a second time deserves that. You must understand Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is not your casual everyday anime, I'll not try to make it something it is not, but I'll tell you for what it's worth. Tengen Toppa gurren lagann is the best story out there that I've seen in all the anime's of the genre and possibly of all that I've seen. The characters are something so endearing and they take you all onto the biggest journey into beating\n          \n        (spoiler) existance into oblivion itself! I watched it once a few years back and the sentiment I got from it was one of the hardest I've felt for almost anything I've done in my life. The story sure it's not the best AT THE TIME but once you look back at it you feel like it couldn't have been possibly made better by far. The art is so colorfull and grey sometimes which is kinda how life is also somedays. The greatest feeling I have about it, did it the first time and now I have it again. Is that, even when you finish watching it, you don't feel that whole in you stomach or in your heart, because they don't drill that into you, they teach you a lesson and you keep it with you forever. This are my two cents :)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    Using the word “EPIC” to describe this show would be cutting it short. Very short.\n“Gurren Lagann” is one of those shows that’s best just accepted instead of questioned. If you look for logic in a lot of events that happen here, you might as well be a pompous douche and write an essay on why time-travel in “Back to The Future” is illogical. Granted, it’s not a particularly clever show. In fact, it’s very stupid, but I can’t call it stupid for the simple truth that it knows what it is very well. So “ingenious” is the word I’ll use. Simply put, “Gurren Lagann” is\n          \n        the most epic anime show I’ve ever witnessed, and I mean in scale and sheer scope. There’s really nothing else that comes close to the ludicrously gigantic nature of this series. So when you have robots so big, that they’re literally throwing around entire galaxies like frisbies… yeah, that’s just the tip of the iceberg.\nGoing hand-in-hand with this show’s “so epic, it will kill your grandchildren” factor is the insane action. The action is fast-paced, incredibly animated, and very fluid. I can’t describe the action much more than that because it has a very unique sense of style to it, almost like a manga artist that tripped acid and decided to animate it. It’s balls-to-the-wall, gut-wrenching stuff. Seriously, there’s points where I could’ve easily facepalmed at how far-fetched the concept tends to go, such as a giant robot piloting a giant robot that’s piloting an even bigger robot that’s piloting the biggest robot you could possibly imagine on a universal scale. But the show convinces you of its ludicrous nature so well, that you just begin to accept it at some point and go along for the ride.\nCharacter-wise is also where this show ultimately shines. Simon, our main protagonist, is a lovable little loser with emotional issues in the beginning of the series, but as time progresses, we witness him turn into one of the most badass characters in all of anime (takes notes, Shinji Ikari, pre-Evangelion 2.0). He easily has one of the most compelling and outright awesome character arcs I’ve ever seen, and his development is like watching your own child grow up. Then there’s Kamina, Simon’s older brother (kinda), who looks out for him but also has balls of steel. Hiis impact is felt throughout the entire series as characters constantly remind us why he was so bloody awesome. To be honest, he really is. And while I didn’t find him as great of a character as Simon, he gave the show a much needed emotional weight, especially when… you know… I’m just gonna stop talking about him now… Yoko is the final character of the main three. I personally didn’t care much for her character. Ultimately, while she does have plenty of relevance to the first half of the show, she just eventually amounts to a pair of boobs bouncing around the screen for the sake of having all the manly testosterone balanced with fan service. Also, she gets thrown around as a love interest more times in the course of the series than a stripper on a busy day, making her a seem very unmotivated for the most part. Anyway, she serves her purpose then leaves, so we can instead focus on Simon being a badass.\nAll in all, I had great fun with “Gurren Lagann”. It does come with it’s flaws, such as a few characters who are just flat-out despicable (*cough* Rossiu *cough*), but in the bulk of the things it gets right, these flaws seem like fickle nitpicks. When the show wants to be awesome, it transcends everything you’ve ever likely seen before, and presents some of the most gravity-defying, genre-breaking action. It shoves a middle finger in the face of logic, and you should too. Because “Gurren Lagann” is EPIC. EPIC. EPIC. Even saying it three times in caps lock doesn’t seem to cut it either… \n        "},

I had just finished watching some crappy anime and was surfing the web for the next anime I should watch.  I read the synopsis and I have to say it just seemed like the same old boring mecha anime with a hot girl.  \nWithout any other anime series to watch I bit the bullet and watched the first episode... then the second... and before I knew it, I realized I was watching the best show I've ever seen.  That's right.

I try to watch it no more than once or twice a year so as not to ruin it for myself.  Do yourself a favor and watch this anime.

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    Just thought I would share a couple thoughts about how u felt about the anime. \nI watched it on Netflix and chose it because I recognized the Kamina  and Yoko characters from pictures on the various websites. I figured since I've seen them so often lots of people must have enjoyed it. \nI really enjoyed the first half of the series. The main cast were entertaining and made me laugh the adventure the heroes found themselves on was varied and upped the ante as they battled the beast men and the spiral king. \nA unexpected event towards the end of the first storyline was\n          \n        pretty unexpected to me though the eventual ending to the first story arc was ended a little to abruptly. \nIt was the second half of the series that felt like the series had lost some of its charm and focus after a seven year time skip. It was nice to see how some of the characters grew up and what they did during that time but the eventual battles against the anti spirals felt unperilous and repetitive. Some of the plots such as the execution sentencing of Simon was out of place and almost infuriating. As the battles became bigger and bigger as their mechs grew bigger and the arenas went deeper into space is found myself caring less and less for the what was happening. I would have liked to see a longer episode or more of the last one focus on the epilogue which takes place 20 years later. \nMy only other nitpick is the constant use of still pictures with no animation. It just seemed a little lazy. Overall I enjoyed the series and would happily like recommend it to others. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    There are many things that can be said about an anime like Gurren Lagann. I've heard people tell me that the anime is perfect, I've had others tell me the hype is what killed it. Without any bias, I can honestly say that this is one of the greatest shows, let alone just anime, ever created. Though not to say it's perfect.\nFor one, the story is simple enough, and even follows the hero's journy extremely closely. The way that it progresses feels like Gurren Lagann is trying to stand up as an epic tale, like the ones of old passed down from person to person.\n          \n        Tales like Beowulf. And if that's what it's trying to do, I love that idea. And it certainly feels epic. It takes the ideas of what can be done to new heights, with the main focus of the show being about the power of the human spirit and going beyond our own capabilities. Sure, we've seen that a lot, but I don't think we've seen it like this.\nThe characters are all identifiable and given time to shine, at least the ones we're supposed to focus on. The treatment of the side characters is one of the few flaws the show has, but the main characters are fantastic. Of course we have our main trio, Kamina, Simon, and Yoko, who are one of the best main characters to grace an anime. Simon is one of those characters who at first seems like he'll be one of the weakest elements of the show, but thankfully evolves into something more; his own man with his own rules. Kamina is a very larger than life character, constantly spewing his own ideals and mottos down other people's throats, but that's honestly what is so great about the guy. He is so memorable and likable, while still being very stubborn, while also making a huge impact on everyone else. And then there is Yoko, who I've heard people call 'fanservice' or a 'mary sue' (If anything, Nia is more of a mary sue). But, I disagree. She's a strong, independent character who deals with reason and thinks before she acts, but is allowed to be angry and jealous. All the other characters who show up and leave an impact like Nia and Kittan are also great.\nThe music is very epic and boisterous, fitting the theme of the show. I have no complaints, I just really like the soundtrack.\nThe animation and the style is completely insane and balls to the wall. The action is exhilarating and over the top. It is epic madness, but the madness is infectiously fun. The animation is fluid, intense, and it all looks really good.\nOne of the greatest things about the show is just how much fun it is, how much it can not take itself seriously and just be a damn fun time. It has plenty of homages and references to other sci-fi anime, feeling like an open love letter to classic mecha, while also standing on its own as a unique product. That is very commendable.\nWhile you might not agree with me, Gurren Lagann is not perfect, it has flaws. But, I'd hate if it was flawless, it would feel too alien. But because it has flaws, combined with an epic story, larger than life characters, an epic soundtrack, and inspiring themes, it has risen to become a beloved classic to many, and has a special place in my heart as my favorite anime to date.\n        "},

Sad moments are going to make you cry manly tears (even if you're a woman) and hype moments will blow your freaking brains right in front of your face. I can barely think of any characters I disliked or hated (that weren't redeemed eventually) and don't let the alienated internet fool you, the female lead has a strong, independent\n          \n        personality despite being the series eyecandy.\nThe mechas (for the most part) felt more like \"character amplifiers\" rather than your regular (dull) protective shells, pilots' facial expressions and gestures can be understood without having to show inside their cockpit sometimes, but more importantly, mechas won't No Sell everything beside other mechas, although mechas remain the predominant fighters.\nThe art style can and will get a bit rougher at some points, but I believe that only serves to emphasize the roughness going on. Several songs got permanently stuck inside my head...\n        "},

Most people say that his show is just dumb fun, and you should just turn off your brain, but I am here to say that Gurren Lagann is a very intelligent anime. \nStory 10: You know how in Naruto and Dragon ball Z it seems like the characters just get strong and STronger and STRONGER, well it is almost like this is a satire of that genre, but not.

Watch this show, and love this show for what it is... its' own thing.\n A Masterpiece doesn't mean that there are no flaws, a painters life achievement may still hold flaws, but those flaws can't hold a drill to the beauty and that is tengen Toppa GURREN LAGANN.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    There are few anime out there as chaotic, exhilarating, blood pumping, and surprisingly meaningful as Gurren Lagann. It's infamous for its overly manly and high octane and at time ludicrous action. Some call it childish, obnoxious, and even stupid. \nThen, suddenly, the anime flip turns upside down and becomes one of the most serious, gripping, and compelling sagas I ever witnessed. \nSee, Gurren Lagann isn't about the story really, even though it is an amazing one. Gurren Lagann is a strikingly deep and rich tale of a boy and his life. The anime progresses through the stages of boy and eventually manhood. It starts obnoxious\n          \n        and high octane because that's the life of a boy. By the time the protagonist and focus Simon is an adult, the anime has sobered up, and shows its true colours. This causes a great division in the fan base. There's those who obsess over the first half with its ridiculous action and humour and then forsake the grim, dark, and serious middle, and then go crazy over the truly insane finale. Then there's those who love the middle serious part, think the beginning is okay, and the finale unbelievably epic. I fall in the middle. The finale is of course my favorite, but I truly love both the beginning and the middle for what they both offer. \nThe story is of Simon and Kamina, two brothers who dig their way up to the surface of Earth to discover it is ruled by Beastmen who pilot mecha known as Gunmen. Kamina is the embodiment of Man while Simon is a timid and at times angsty teenager . They meet a band of humans, including Yoko, the 13 year old voluptuous sniper badass. I can't continue with the story without spoilers. After Episode 13, it cuts 7 years into the future, where all the characters mature and become different than their childish pasts. After this serious break, the anime's insanity returns and increases the stakes by about 52.8 billion lightyears (Those who saw the anime just chuckled) \nGurren Lagann takes every cliche trope there is and ramps it up to 11, in a way that it feels strangely new and enjoyable again. If I could describe this show in one word, it'd be \"ridiculous\", and I don't mean that in a bad way in the slightest. Yoko's beyond curved yet she has one of the most developed personalities of any female lead I've seen. Dai-Gurren's deck resembles a massive erect penis. It takes the idea that anime needs to escalate to new extremes. Gurren Lagann is the type of anime where the heroes must find an enemy, blow the CRAP out of it, and then move on to the bigger and badder villain. I don't consider this spoilers, but the anime just keeps escalating and climaxing to the point where the final enemy....is the Universe itself, with all of its stars and galaxies. That's about as big as you can get, and Gurren Lagann knows it. It shocks you and grabs your attention with nothing else other than its unique spirit and confidence. I makes you feel like a kid again, only to have you slowly mature. \nThe anime, hilarious and action filled as it is, hits the emotional notes rather strongly, specifically in the final episodes. As the stakes rise, so does the peril we see these characters get into. Despite the ridiculously awesome final fight, Gurren Lagann sweeps in with a conclusion that is an emotionally perfect end to the cast of characters whom we all end up cherishing. It's perfectly fitting with the theme of the anime, that this is the final stage in manhood, a bittersweet conclusion to all that we knew and loved. Gurren Lagann isn't for those soulless bastards who hate well made fun. The very premise makes no sense whatsoever, and the finale is one of the most nonsensical and mind boggling out there. This may scare away some, but please, just have ah eart and find enjoyment. There's a reason Gurren Lagann is a Bro Favorite. \nAside from the abomination that is Episode 4, Gurren Lagann is a tight rollercoaster from beginning to end, with an ending that will break the heart of anyone who watches it. It also contains some of the most beautiful and absolute good themes in any anime I have seen. It's a saga of heroism, triumph over the most impossible of obstacles, being who you are, and achieving that ultimate pursuit of happiness and entitlement. \nTo say Gurren Lagann's cast is massive is an understatement. Despite the ridiculous size of Team Gurren, nearly every characters is fleshed out, likable, and well developed. When I think of crap characters, I can only really think of one, Rossiu, whose bullshit ideology and epilogue force any viewer to hate him. No character fades out of the spotlight and everyone is constantly thrust back in. Fan favorites will include Kamina, who is still to this day one of the most iconic and beloved male protagonists of anime history, Yoko, whose mocking satire of fanservice is backed up by her excellent and subtle personality, Simon, whose overcoming of despair will inspire any viewer, and Kittan, whose Devil-may-care attitude makes him easy to root for and even easier to weep for as his ego is always tumbling down and rising up (My personal favourite)\nSimon is a powerful protagonist to say the least. He begins as a lowly teenage digger, but through various hardships he is FORCED to become a manly leader, but even then he faces even greater challenges and the fear he is actually a failure. I can't go much into him or his older Kamina without going into heavy spoiler territory, so I won't. Their chemistry together is phenomenal, with Kamina's overly manly ego being the perfect balance to Simon, and stands as his idol throughout the series, bringing in family drama and conflict when Simon begins to diverge from his own worshiping of Kamina. Nia, Simon's love interest, is the single character who I can truly say is just an awful character. She is flat as a plank and really doesn't contribute anything until the finale, and even then just kinda stands aside. She's a Mary Sue at worst and a plank at best, which sucks because she's one of the primary characters. \nHoly. \nFucking. \nShit. \nThat's the only way I can describe Gurren Lagann's animation. I have a huge respect for hand drawn animation, and it is one of the reasons I have a strong prejudice towards newer anime. There's something special watching something drawn on PAPER by HAND, not drawn on a computer drawing software. Gurren Lagann was painstakingly hand drawn for the most part, and though it's not nearly as smooth as say Cowboy Bebop, it's still art on its own. The beginning's jagged, exaggerated, and angled animation fits with the angst and testosterone of the beginning. The middle is when the animation REALLY steps up, rivaling most anime today. HOWEVER, IT'S FUCKING FINALE! WOW! 40% of the entire anime's budget went into just the animation of the final 3 episodes. That's SOMETHING, and WOW does it show. Have I hyped the finale too much? Well it delivers, and more.\nNow for soundtrack. Well, the OP's are killer, Libera Me From Hell is an audio orgasm, but nothing else really stands out and it all sounds rather generic. \nTTGL is one of the few shows I have watched that had me wholly gripped and had my hype increasing steadily throughout. This is an anime one HAS to watch in one sitting to fully appreciate that feeling. By the end, it'll make a Man out of you too. Since Evangelion, Studio GAINAX seemed hellbent on creating that one perfect anime that was equally enjoyably fun and striking deep and philosophical. Evangelion sacrificed the former for its finale and being a little TOO direct and obnoxious with the symbolism, FLCL totally ditched the idea of a coherent and enjoyable plot but got the sublime imagery and philosophy perfectly. It seems finally with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann that they found that equal balance, with a plot based around its desired themes of maturity, perseverance, and manhood. It may be VERY stupid at some point (How the Hell does Team Gurren breathe in space?) but it's still one Hell of a roller-coaster. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a towering and roaring success a modern day classic, one that should be enjoyed through the ages by anyone and everyone willing to give their time to it. "},

It's the Mecha of Mechas. Watching this anime alone has been proven scientifically that you could bloat your testicles if you have one, and if you don't, then be prepared to wear a bigger pants because your junk will be satiated and grown to form a bulge, metaphorically. Just when you thought, \"Oh man can't we have a much profound symbolism in Mecha nowadays?\n          \n        It's always about fighting and getting about boring dialogue\". ALTO! Hold your tits you little runt, cause Imaishi had just climbed up into the producer's desk and shook his testicle and thus given birth to the best thing that could be animated in the screen and for us to enjoy, (no sexual innuendo here)\nIn an hindsight, there are many themes concurrently conjugating and weaving together in this anime. You can't vouch to say which one is the profound among the rest. There are Friendship, Spirit and determination, Human's Comportment and of course dealing with your life when nature decides to screw it. One way to see it is that this is an all-round anime without irregularities when forming the circle. Anyone can just sit through the whole series without feeling bored.\nIf I were a father, I would force my kid to watch this as an early media for them just so that they can soon grow to be a REAL MAN! (keyword : If).\n1. Story\nBasically, the whole anime is mainly about growing up and dealing with the dead-ones and move on. You must think, \"Oh c'mon, we already have buttloads of that Anime scattered around already\" which comes to my gratitious reply of \"Do they have a fighting mecha?\". *Angels descending with an inscription of FTW behind me*. I don't want to provide spoilers, but I'll leave this an ambiguous case to anyone who haven't watched it yet. This anime takes a whole new step in killing many characters in the show. Nope, they won't come back. Once the living were grovel down six inch feet, there's no way that they could resurrecting them to live again unless of course you got Phoenix Down (won't work with Aerith though), convinced Jesus to do it or some dude tuning in to the Thriller music. But I digress, this is almost the same par with George R.R. Martin styles of writing, cause the next time you like the character, THINK IT OVER!\nIt's not just that, the Anime also prevails our Human's core to the deep root. I never liked one of those anime that starts with the dialog, \"In the beginning, there was a big bang.. then human starts to killed each other\",\nuhh.. am I watching Nova science show or an Anime. Gurren Lagann makes its grand debut of how this stuff should be pulled off by any story-writer without lodging 3 ass episodes on some crappy philosophy that any nards of homeless man can conjured up or  some cheap ass stuff that you could enumerate in reddit or 4chan but a tip of your ingenuity of creativity to display it. When humans starts to yonder ways of thinking, their mind will tremble in fragility. If you think you're civilised enough, well.. again, THINK IT OVER!\nSounds like a deep Anime? Well, this is not your EVA's slice where they spent the ending worth of whole 20+ episodes on something stupid and irrelevant like being inside  of Shinji's mind or what-not. Rest assured, Gurren Lagann have its ending, and its worth it. Sad? Happy? WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK THIS ANIME IS??! WATCH IT NOW!\nI would like to think the truest and stands above of all themes of this Anime is purely of Spirit of Unity. Standing together no matter what with a like-spirited group to defeat the odds.\n2. Graphics and Animation\nLittle sunny-side to a western animation, methinks? The Key Animator should be showered with all sorts of praise after what he had done to the Anime. The graphics and animation are still good to date, if you like the robust and funky style of fighting sequence from FLCL (Fooly Cooly), Fullmetal Alchemist and Kill la Kill, then you are on a roll. The same funky and fun to watch theme were being implemented in Gurren Lagann. They went from being a normal mecha fighting to a cuhrayzee combination and nonsensical name till the end. Will it intercede the enjoyment? Oh please, this is like the best thing in the Anime actually.\nI think Imaishi, the Key Animator has a quite distinct style of any anime that he handled upon. Anyway, apart from 14 years old growing a huge jug of boobs, the character design of each of them were unique. The names are easily remembered and you could really tell apart each character even by their personality and characteristics and this isn't even with the inclusion of their design yet. The characters in this Anime are rich and for each time-skip between events, you could really tell that they are growing and thus developing more pronounced facial features like Simon had. There are little to no CGI in this Anime except for some Mugann during the human extermination thingy going on during a certain period of Fighting Session which is easily blown up by the lagann, this fact remains the obvious answer to why it's CGI-ed and not hand-drawn. So, you don't have to grit your teeth and keeps thinking if there's any choppy and awkward CGI to be blended in the Anime.\n3. Characters and Characteristics\n\"Aniki~!!\" -Simon\nJust hearing this, greatly reminiscence me of how great David Hayter's VA in Metal Gear Solid where he shouted, \"FOX~!!\" before Gray Fox charging in to destroy the radome and put it on huge disadvantage point. Just pure VA skills could sewed a tight fabric of bonding between 2 characters. This is what it means by VA skills. You could tell what they have been through before just by hearing their calling to each other. In a sense, it has a best VA to date, not your usual cutesie and plain acting, but a lavish at its finest. I dunno, it's just that vibration in their voices that makes it memorable to me.\nThe protagonist and antagonist have a very clear reason to fight between each other, a solid reason and each of it were being explained to dot of why they're doing such action. It's never the reason like, \"I have to fight you Naruto, cause the fans demand it and we're having more pages to waste at the ending of this volume..\".\nThat's another thing about Gurren Lagann, it's not about the main crux or themes that they are trying to present but rather elaborating the deep brotherly connection to each other and how good they are connected to the extent of goes full vendetta on the king himself, oh and when I said \"KING\" in this anime context it could mean 'God'. Yup, they take the whole phrase of \"Our drill will penetrate the heaven\" too literal I think.\nMany Anime did tried to produce the same theme but fails for  the outcome. Gurren Lagann did it without being too cheesy and in the end, you felt bad for the character and roots for it 'till the end of the series which is rare occasion to a man like me.\nP/S: You'll be surprised at the ending just to see who's the narrator actually for the whole time of the Anime.\n4. Sound and OST\nThis goes without saying that this anime has one of the best Musics and OSTs. Have you heard the music, 'Thrust through the heavens with your spirit'? Have you heard the OP and ED? They are just vernacularly AWESOME! The OSTs are fitting on each scene and flows with the atmosphere. Wants to jam along when these Lagann are threshing the bad guys? sure.. wants a motivational soundtrack to raise your chin up from depression? HELL YEAH~!\nNote: I think I might be elaborating about sound and whatnot on other sections above, so I'm not gonna re-iterate.\nOverall:\nThere are 2 ways that you can watch this Anime, one would be its idea and story about humanity and the other is of course, the cuhrayzee battle sessions of each lagann. Of course, you could just watched the series to ogle at Yoko's boobs but really, there's crapload of H-portal for that. Either way, this is a splendid series, I think they done every explanation that is needed and some of it are left to fans speculation especially about some elements in it.\nI'm sorry if there's any misinformation or grammar mistake(s) in this wall-text and I have tried my best of not putting any spoilers in it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I finished Gurren Lagann not too long ago and decided to make this anime my first review... So here I go. I’ll start off by saying I was pretty much forced into watching TTGL by my cousins who were all into the hype (and still are) years ago. At first I was pretty iffy on the anime being a mecha and all- a genre that I don’t come across watching too often. But surprisingly I enjoyed it, overall giving it a rate of 9. \nStory: 8 < I have to admit that I wasn't exactly drawn into the anime from the first episode. Personally it\n          \n        was a tad slow in my opinion; however, at episode four I became more the interested. It's hard writing about the story without giving away spoilers so I'll leave off with that. \nArt: 9 < The art seemed pretty basic to me at first, but throughout, the animation seemed to get better with each fight. There were vivid colors crafted into the show which really set the scene with a ‘fiery’ mood within characters to mecha battles. The art runs smoothly from each event to the next in a way that didn’t allow me to take my eyes off of the screen. The details of the animation went above par with anime of those created in the year of 2007.\n Characters: 9 < The characters outcome of TTGL were far from being dull. About each and every character had undergone excellent development throughout the series. From the start, Kamina, a particular character shines out with an inspiring attitude which ‘contagiously’ spreads to other characters most obviously affecting the main protagonist Simon. The characters play an important role in the motivational theme of the story. All in all, the character development of Gurren Lagann was superb and definitely topped most anime in my opinion. \nSound/Music: 10 < Instantly after I finished the last episode of Gurren Lagann, I downloaded tunes on my phone right away. From opening, ending, to soundtracks the music of TTGL blew me away. Although it may not be everyone’s cup of tea, the sounds in this anime left me breath taking and never failed to leave me pumped up and ready for more. Music surely assisted the epic battles and created heartfelt moments which left me with a feeling an emotion too hard to describe.\nEnjoyment: 9 < Simply put, I really enjoyed this series and unlike most anime I watch that leave hanging endings, Gurren Lagann gave me a sense of satisfaction. \nOverall: 9 < There were a few minor things that held me back from giving this anime a 10 but overall Gurren Lagann is an excellent show I would recommend. It didn’t fail to give me what I had not been looking for at first. Very inspirational quotes and characters I couldn’t help but fall in love with which ties in with why I like this anime so much."},

(OH and the monologues sound pathetic and corny in english so be sure to watch it in Japanese with subs)\nFirst off I just have to say that every time the heroes in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann got stronger, I FELT LIKE GETTING OFF MY CHAIR AND BREAKING SOMETHING. IT WAS JUST SO UNBELIEVABLE, I WAS CHEERING AND SHOUTING  WHILE WATCHING THIS SHOW. The message this anime sends manages to convey something that no anime, movie, or television show, has ever done.\nStory -  After\n          \n        seeing the first 10 secs of this anime i was hooked. The way it was presented and the monologue that accompanied it was fantastic. Just when you think all is lost the 2 main characters develop into unstoppable forces. This is a show about believing in yourself to break down walls, and climb endless mountains, in order to fight for all that is good and stave off despair. \nFirst off the story is set in a post-apocalypic world (I know doesn't sound very original). But as the anime progresses the secrets of this world are slowly revealed. The most AMAZING BITCHIN story ever. A boy who discovers his destiny is to save the earth, humanity, and the universe from oppressive tyranny! \nThe main weapon of this anime is the drill (sounds pathetic), but surprisingly enough the drill turns out to be a creative weapon that represents more than just a weapon in this anime (hint hint).  \nArt - At first glance the art seems pretty average. Plenty of animes like Death note and Samurai X have higher quality animation. However, when someone does something incredible in this show, the animation style instantly changes. Lines streak across the characters face and body creating new textures previously unseen in this anime or any other anime ever created. These streaks give the characters a new badass look (if your confused you'll know what I'm talking about when you watch it).\nSound - What can I say. Music can either make or break an anime. This anime would have been terrible had the music been awful. The intro song is excellent, so no worries there. The music played while watching the anime successfully creates the correct atmospheres at the proper times. I found myself admiring the music as much as the story and animation. And the second half of the anime has a song that is a combination between rap (the rap is in english) and opera. They actually compliment each other very well. I have no doubt you will feel you need to download this song after watching the anime.\nCharacter - The characters are well developed and you come to love them all. Kamina has the most unique personality ever. He has a demeanor that makes you want to go out and beat the hell out of all the pansies in the world.\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann breaks anime boundaries and goes beyond the norm. I highly doubt there will ever be another anime like this. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    In a world where spilling blood is seen as grotesque, where characters are seen to have died randomly when they were made for that very purpose, where ass pulls require a scientific explanation; Gurren Lagann stands up and says F*** THAT!\nTry asking someone to explain the whole of Gurren Lagann to you. Before long you'll find them fumbling over their words and ,not soon after, slip into an incoherent psychobabble. This is why Gurren Lagann is so great. The show goes all out from the first and never really steps down from its stage or slows down even in episodes that are meant for development.\nIt\n          \n        is hard to try and review Gurren Lagann for its plot, setting, character development or anything that you were forced to dissect an enjoyable book into a chore to get your hands on in high school English. All it is, all it is about, is fun and without saying to much this becomes very prevalent in the later episodes.\nA lot of stories seem to think that ass pulls; those story breaking scenarios/powers are okay as long as they are justified through lore or science however I believe this is insulting. Viewers are smart enough to know when something shouldn't or couldn't happen and trying to convince them, hoping they haven't sat high school science, with bare bones reasons is really insulting and breaks immersion horribly.\nHowever Gurren Lagann doesn't have this problem. The creator gets you're here for fun not for a science lecture. \nWith that said I do not believe there's really much else to say about Gurren Lagann. It's purely for fun, not to be artistic so dissecting it into an essay about animation quality, sound quality, story and whatnot would be pointless.\nYou'll either like it or dislike it but if you like it you'll really like it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    \"My drill is the one that pierces the heavens! Even if that hole becomes my grave, as long as I break through, I shall be victorious! Who the hell do you think I am?! I’m Simon! I’m not my brother Kamina! I am myself! Simon the digger!\"\n~Simon\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, in many ways, is a parody of a typical shounen mecha show that breaks out of the genre to become something else entirely.\nIn a post-apocalyptic world, humanity is forced underground to escape the beastmen, ruled by the Spiral King, that hunt them on the surface. Underground, the humans dig tunnels and live in peace. The\n          \n        best digger in the village, Simon, discovers a golden drill, and awakens an ancient mecha with incredible power. Using this mecha, Simon and friends decide to rebel against the beastmen and the evil Spiral King to save humanity from subjugation. \nFrom this point the show quickly locks itself into a simple formula of setting a goal, beating up that goal, and then finding a new goal. While early on the plot can be almost episodic and there is no clear direction, the show quickly gains a clear and defined point B.\nThe characters are pretty typical but the main cast do receive large amounts of developments. Best example is probably Kamina, while absent for the majority of the series his impact on the rest of the characters in the show, even characters he never interacted with, is astounding. Early on Kamina is a somewhat annoying and headstrong take-no-shit character. Over time though you realize and even appreciate what he did and stood for.\nYoko is your typical fan-service girl with guns, but even she has a rare amount of depth to her. Simon starts off as the simple timid and wussy mecha protagonist but quickly comes into a league of his own and is easy to cheer for.\nAs mentioned Gurren Lagann often parodies other shounen mecha shows. Often not caring about explaining the aftermath of fights or character motivations and simply decides to fix everything with explosions. This formula is shattered around the midway point of the show with a time skip. The show quickly becomes dark and starts talking about serious themes such as war crimes and political ramifications.\nWhile some people question it’s relevance in a show like Gurren Lagann, my issue stemmed not from it’s sudden change is direction, but with how contrived and broken certain plot elements and character motivations became. Certain events have an outcome and consequences that don’t make any sense and seem to conflict with what would probably happen if the world were real. It ends up coming off as an attempt to shove superfluous drama down your throat.\nHowever, the show then quickly kicks itself back in gear and goes back to it’s “explosions fix everything” mindset, that culminates in one of the most epic conclusions I’ve ever seen in an anime.\nOn the animation side of things everything is done well, except for episode four. The fight scenes are wonderfully animated, the mechas look great in motion, and the characters are easily recognizable.\nThe sound on the other hand leaves something to be desired. I’m not much of a hip-hop fan, so the main track that plays later on in the series is more irritating than enjoyable, regardless of how catchy it is. The OP and EDs are well done though and have a song attached to them that you’ll most likely be hearing in your head long after the show is over.\nOverall Gurren Lagann is a fantastic show that shatters the norm most people are accustomed to. It’s fast paced and it’s scale eventually becomes super-massive. The show is quite the enjoyable ride.\nGurren Lagann is a show that most people consider a classic, and after having watched it I can certainly see why.\n        "},

He eventually finds love and works hard to protect her along with everyone else.\nI finished this series and had to write a review right away. To start what upset me the most was the character development, the character relationships are almost nothing like what you may hope for, while you may not be looking for a harem the main character in this anime is almost completely neglected and leaves a lot to be desired.\nSecond most upsetting was the ending, for whatever\n          \n        reason they decided on an ending that is neither tragic nor leaving a \"happy\" feeling, you end up feeling upset that there is nothing new in the development in fact something is even lost at the end.\nAfter the 27 episodes it takes to finish this (which honestly gets dragged out pretty far I had trouble focusing on finishing the last couple) you should just end up feeling cheated and disappointed. I do not recommend this show. \n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    I'm going to keep this review very short because most of what I want to say about this fantastic show has been said already.  \nThis anime, like many of Gainax's works, is an emotional roller-coaster that will have you at the edge of your seat with anticipation of what will happen next.  Which is somewhat funny based on the fact that this is basically the epitome of a super robot anime.  When I say this I mean that the action is so completely overblown that it stretches the boundaries of what a super robot can do.  As I said earlier people\n          \n        have already said what I want to say in other reviews, so i'll just get on with addressing the criticism.\nI feel that one of the reasons this anime is criticized so much is because it combines a ton of story elements from previous robot animes!  putting aside things like Gunbuster and Diebuster that were made by the same company this show borrows heavily from older shows such as Getter Robo.  People tend to get caught up in this and dismiss it as a clone of these super robot shows.  That is not the case, TTGL is meant to be an homage to the super robot anime genre as a whole. it takes alot of the best elements of various super robot shows and crushes them together which, you may think, would result in an entirely unoriginal anime.  This is not the case as TTGL embraces these elements and ends up making them its own.  It takes the familiar and modifies it into something unique and original.\nThis show also gets a lot of hate for its mecha designs.  Before I had watched this series I had given the mecha designs a look and hated them!  I love the more realistic designs from shows such as Gundam and Code Geass, and at the time the design of the gunmen looked stupid.  However after watching the show they began to grow on me and now Gurren Lagann might be one of my favorite mecha designs of all time.  They are an acquired taste but certainly shouldn't put people off from watching this fantastic anime!\nIf you can get past both of those things definitely give this show a chance. Its a fantastic super robot spin on a boys ascent to manhood and all the challenges that come with it. \n        "},

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is one those rare mecha anime gems that may be over looked by many people due to its mecha genre. When I hear the word mecha, I think of gundam and its epic space battles. However, its plagued with mundane talks of politics and other nonsensical subjects that may drive some viewers insane. TTGL is different. It is an adrenaline pumped, tear jerking, and hilarious master piece that should be watched even if you hate mecha. It gets into a some politics, but its\n          \n        values are very simple to understand. Most episodes are a blend of epic robo battles and light-hearted comedies, but don't misunderstand. This anime has tear jerking moments that will keep you hooked for the rest of the ride. Don't worry, these tear jerking moments aren't one of those weird squeamish moments you find yourself in when watching anime, but more practical and understandable. Also, the character and story development is one of the best I've ever seen. Some lines said by characters and story situations may seem like a parody because of its sheer ridiculousness, but this is the charm of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagaan. I forgot to mention that the animation in this series is top class it is smooth. It's funny ,epic, and heart warming till the very end.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\nOK, I have to admit that I was honestly taken back by this. I'm not big on mecha anime so I wasn't expecting much of this anime (Code geass was an exception) but frankly it wasn't bad at all. the plot is deep as seen in the first episode, Simon the young timid boy who dug tunnels and his badass, loud soul brother Kamina who struggle to make it to the surface in an era where humans know only despair and oppression. That plot was very well thought. the story develops more when the boys get their hands on the weapons called\n          \n        'gunmen' and start their rebellion against the tyrant king. I think the show was doing very fine up until Kamina's death, I think it was a good turning point (but it was a bit rushed, like in episode 8!! and he was my fav...) the time skip was Ok as well, showing how humans evolved and built cities, however, the struggle continues on and on...and problems keep on growing like mushrooms.\nOne of the points I thought of as one of the cons was making time skip Simon completely badass, it felt kinda forced, sometimes I think it doesn't feel like Simon anymore as if the essence of the character is lost, I know a death of a comrade should change his character but I think it was too drastic. Another thing, Nia, the daughter of the spiral king, the cute and 'perfect' princess was a very lame character imo, I guess the writers thought of her as a reason to make simon keep on fighting and no more, their whole romance thing was just not very well made, Yoko is a much better leading female character.\nThe ending was pretty much expected, a death of some dai-gurren members and the survival of others, it was kinda nice seeing how the survivors grew old and continued their lives.\nThe sound track of the anime was a killer! the heavy guitar just fits the fights and gives the chills, however the choices of opening and endings was weak, especially the opening used in the final episode kinda ruined the atmosphere.\nall in all, it's a very enjoyable anime with funny moments, great cast of characters, an overdose of machoness, coolness, overreaction about boobs  (you'd be pleased if you admire such things...*no wonder this anime was highly recommended by many males, that's what I noticed at least*) and a well-written plot. If you're a mecha fan then you shouldn't miss it, and if you're not, you might wanna give it a shot. it's worth the while."},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Gurren Lagann is a mecha show by (the revered) GAINAX. By now, you've either stopped reading my review in disgust or you've stopped reading my review because you know already that you'll like the show and my review will do you no good at all. However, I shall press on for those that remain. To any extent, the show is a much greater endevor - and a largely successful one at that - than simply calling it 'GAINAX's new mecha show' would suggest. First, and perhaps most importantly, the story is different and diverting. What begins, in many ways, as an ordinary mecha show quickly\n          \n        takes various surprising and unforseen turns that serve to keep you into the show and interested wholly. The largest strength of the show is, indeed, in the writing. The show turns what could be an average mecha show by all accounts and morphs the plot, takes it in directions that you didn't expect. Its full of surprises, to put it in short. The action is swift, frentic, and fun - like a manic homage to the era of mecha shows gone by - and yet, the show doesn't disolve into pure homage at any given point either. Nor does it rely entirely on its action sequences, for that matter. The characters are the real stars here, as they interact with each other in various human and emotionally powerful ways. Fair warning, there is a good deal of angst in this - angst that feels both appropriate and ripped off from an older and possibly better Gundam series. That being said, it doesn't detract from the show besides. The art serves this purpose well. Granted, the beautiful and the cheap do mingle pretty freely here - in true GAINAX fashion - but the scenes of stock footage (its a combining mecha show, folks) or otherwise cheapies do not detract from the show enough that you'll probably notice or care. This is especially the case when the money saved on some scenes seems to be put to use creating other very beautiful ones. It all balances out somewhere, I imagine. And the art is indeed stellar. Its shiney and crisp, when appropriate, but it is also deep and professional when necessary. The show is able to carry the aforementioned pathos very well in this way. There is a good bit of fanservice - mostly at the less than serious moments so its not too galling. And uhm...well, the art is really good and the fanservice looks really nice so I can't fault it too much. In comparison to other GAINAX shows, this is also not as fanservice-heavy besides. Again, the story and its characters take center stage here. The music deserves a small nod as well. Seemingly taking a cue from American movies, the mecha fights are lined with rock music. It actually works rather well, and I can safely applaud the series for it. Another success feather in its cap. It certainly isn't the deepest show to come around the block, but it is certainly one of the best put together as it marries all the important elements an action mecha show could have and creates something shiney and wonderful, even unique, with it. The pieces of this quilt may appear ordinary but they're actually made from quality material and its all stitched together so well you'll be on the edge of your seat begging for more the entire time. Almost good enough to forgive GAINAX for their past misteps.\n        "},

Its a great story with not many flaws, but there are some. such as the endless cliches that appear in the 2nd half. The art is great and the final battle fills me with glee. N lets talk about music. Tengen Toppa has a very interesting score, but no the best, I found the ops to be annoying (IMO i know lots of people like them), but Libre me from hell was a master piece. Characters were all in all good, but the adding of characters annoyed me,\n          \n        and some times the interaction was repetitive. These are flaws i only noticed from 2nd watch, and thus the enjoyment for a 1st time watched is probably 2nd to few. Over all Tegen Toppa Gurren Lagan is an Amazing show filled with comedy at first, but the switches to a semi serious tone by 2nd season. With its flamboyant characters and over the top action and comedy, you shall enjoy this roller coaster of laughs and \"WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AMS\".

Humanity has been driven underground following a war with an overwhelmingly powerful species.  We start with our two heroes Simon and Kamina, the latter being a trouble making teenager and the former being the young boy who worships him.  They find a mysterious robot while digging rocks, and use it to escape their underground prison with the help of Yoko, a girl who arrives from the surface.  From there they engage in a thrilling adventure filled with fun characters, dynamic fights, and a certain vigor that can only come from the honest\n          \n        enthusiasm of the creators themselves.  There is heartbreak a few episodes in, and I must admit I did not see it coming.  It really serves to compel the audience to see it through to the end.\nHowever, once the show reaches the halfway point everything goes immediately downhill.  They end the first arc by defeating the main villain, and it seems like the show is over... until they do a time jump to about ten years later.  From here the story enters a long, rapid downhill spiral, ruining certain characters, introducing ridiculous plot elements, and frankly feeling awfully exploitative for what started off as such a fun series.  The last half may just make you angry that you didn't stop half way.  It certainly did for me...\nIf you watch just the first half of this anime, it's actually quite good.  Just make sure you stop after the first arc, or all that goodwill will quickly evaporate.\n        "},

Well, they were right. I never really thought much of this anime until I started watching it, and I don't regret a second of it. Although this anime was obviously aimed at male audiences, it still seemed to draw me in more and more. \nI'm not usually the type of person who likes mech anime, but this anime was so beautifully put together and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time watching. There is so much to the story of this,\n          \n        and some parts of the anime are extremely touching. It really makes you understand how the characters are feeling while watching. Some of the characters are connected deeply with each other, and you really come to like them more and more as the anime progresses. \nThis anime combines many genres, and all of them fit together perfectly. It goes from soft romance, to epic battles, that are extremely unpredictable and you'd never expect what happens to actually happen. There is a lot of fighting, but every battle is different, and catches you by suprise in some way. \nThe art in this was quite unusual, I liked it a lot. The characters are drawn in different styles, and most were done extremely well. In some parts of this, the artists drew the scenes in black and white. This was extremely clever considering what was happening in the scene itself. \nI thoroughly enjoyed the music in some scenes. The use of almost \"epic\" music during battles really brings the scene to life. It seems to make the moments you are watching seem more and more amazing as you listen to the songs played. Even the opening of the anime was well done, it makes you want to watch the anime thoroughly if you have not already seen it. \nAlthough this anime is one of my favourites, I thought that the amount of explosions in the anime was too much, especially in the last few episodes. Most of the male fanbase would probably appreciate this more. \nOverall, I thought this anime was perfect (Aside from the amount of explosions!). I thought the ending was absolutely stunning and well thought out. I have not seen many animes with a proper ending, but this one seemed to fit just right. If you have not seen this already, you must watch it. Like people told me, you will not regret it...Not for one split second. \n"},

By far the best first episode I've ever seen in ANYTHING, and it only gets better.\nI can say, without a doubt, that it is one of the most overall impressive and enjoyable animes I've ever seen, with the absolutely most satisfying ending to a series there's been yet.

Sim claro que tem, só que mal aproveitados e um pouco mal desenvolvidos como por ex.\nYoko pq primeiramente o fato dela virar professora não combina nem um pouco com a personagem que virou de fodona badass com uns peitão\n(que diga de se passagem só o Boota aproveitou) pra uma bonitinha e compreensiva professorazinha de uma ilhasinha que ninguem se importa,\ne pq diabos ela foi pra la sendo que eles pudiam ter aproveito o fato dela não ter se encaixado na cidade grande para sei la se tornar uma grande lider de\num vilarejo subterranio rebelde serve? E segundo o fato de toda hora ficar empurrando no primeiro arco um suposto interesse de Yoko no Simon só pra ficar\ndespistando o verdadeiro interesse dela, mas ai eu penso poxa eles vão aproveitar isso no segundo arco pq mesmo com Nia aparecendo deu pra ver que ela teve\numa ponta de ciumes ali e pelo menos esperava eu que se resolvessem sobre aquela noite onde Kamina morreu que ficou meio atravessado na cabeça dos dois,\nmais não eles simplesmente cagam pra isso (e se isso te soa meio cliche foda-se, melhor um cliche bem resolvido do que essa bosta que ficou). \nE finalmente eu aceito o fato de vc autor filho da puta ter matado o primeiro interesse romantico da Yoko, tudo bem é compreensivel pra jogar um pouco de \ndrama na historia, mas vc fazer isso duas vezez ai sacanagem né, e tua acha que eu queria ela ficasse com Kittan? Foda-se o Kittan, era pra ela ter morrido no lugar \ndele, daria muito mais relanvia naquele momento sendo ela fazendo isso, pela fato de uma personagem que esta desde o começo do anime sem fazer quase nada de relevante\npra historia, a desculpe, o fato dela ser uma profissional de primeira sendo cabeleleira e Professora torna ela uma personagem muito relevante para historia sim.\nO Kamina é um personagem confiante e esperançoso até de mais que chegava irratar, que vc não conseguia encontrar um erro sequer nele fazendo ele parecer o personagem menos\nhumano da historia e por consequencia no meu caso não conseguindo ter tanta identeficação com ele, não é personagem ruim ta longe de ser, mas não vejo o pq seria um personagem\ntão interessante a ponto de colocar ele como um dos meu favoritos como outras pessoas fizeram, mas é aquela historia né gosto é igual C*. Mas o engraçado e que foi o personagem \nque foi o melhor desenvolvido onde sua morte foi bem trabalhada tanto que ela deu sustenção para o 2 3 4 arco da historia.\nE Simon grande homem, que de grande e homem só foi duas vezes na vida quando foi para derrotar o Boss pq tirando isso pouca coisa se salva, a palavra que eu tenho para\ndescrever Simon no 3 arco é um cara \"Frouxo\", pq pelo amor de Deus como tu deixa aquela merda do Rossiu fazer oque bem entender com cidade onde vc perde o poder tão rapido \ne facil quanto tirar doce de criança, e essa é só uma das minhas queixas sobre o 3 arco que logo logo eu chego la.\nAgora vamos falar de um tal menino chamado Rossiu que é um dos personagens mais lixos e inconsistente que ja vi na vida, a traição de Rossiu deixou o anime um saco,\nnossa, vontade de explodir a tela do pc, lixo de personagem, lixo, lixo e lixo, não aprendeu nada com a \"Grande Brigada Gurren\", tornou-se apenas mais uma porcaria\ndesnecessária no anime, deveria ter conseguido se matar. Pq acompanhe comigo a seguintes palavras ditas por esse lixo: Comandante supremo Simon, voce esta preso. \nWhat?

Se for colocar ele como vilão coloca de vez onde ele não se arreenpenda de nada\ne chegue a até as ultimas consequencias de sua decisões.\nTem gente falando que o terceiro arco é bom, mas eu super discordo a cidade muito sem vida e chata, habitantes sem gratidão nenhuma onde esqueceram facilmente o \nque Simon fez por eles opoiando aquele lixo, e um golpe de estado totalmente sem nexo nenhum. Eu esperava que eles explorasem e tirasem boas historias dos vilarejos Subterranios\nque foi muito pouco aproveitado nesse 3 arco por esse pulo da historia de 7 anos. Alguem me diz oque tem na cabeça de uma pessoa falar que o 3 arco é \ninteressante de alguma maneira?\nE aquele final bosta onde os dois personagens que tinham um potencial e enorme acabaram depois de tanto sacrificio um sendo um andarilho e a outra voltou para continuar\nsendo a professorazinha de uma ilhazinha que ninguem liga.\nResumindo por incrivel que pareça consegui extrair sim algo de bom, pontos que precisam ser ressaltados são as lutas contra Lord Genome e Anti Spirais que são vilões digno \nde respeito e tambem nada gerericos, tendo uma historia com altos e baixos mas que pra mim acaba pesando a balança mais para uma boa historia no geral, tiveram sim \no queijo e a faca na mão para fazerem uma obra prima mas por problemas ja listados a minha nota é 8.\n        "},

It is, however, an almost perfect recreation of the imagination of a preteen/teen boy, with all the good and bad that entails. I was a teenage boy once (technically, I still am), and Gurren Lagann is exactly the kind of beautiful, over-the-top nonsense I'd dream up in my spare time. Ridiculous action that escalates beyond your wildest imagination? Check. An earnest belief in the power of humanity and one's inner strength as the driving theme? Check. Badass macho posturing so self-assured it'll make you\n          \n        bleed testosterone? Check. A complete lack of interest in its female cast beyond jiggling boobs and support for the male characters' emotional arcs? Unfortunately, check.\nThat's the kind of story Gurren Lagann is. If that's your cup of tea, dive right in and enjoy. There are worse things in life than seeing the world through the eyes of a teen boy for a few hours.

However, I chanced upon a clip online that sold me for the fluid animation. \nAll in all, this series is like, a tad of shounen, mechs, fanservice, and \"if Michael Bay directed anime\" for explosion scenes. The pacing was alright since it was 27 episodes, but I would have preferred if they made the series longer, for more development i.e. during the 7 year timeskip.\nTo me, the series is broken down to four parts: Adventures above the surface\n          \n        and formation of Team Gurren, Taking down Teppelin, Evacuating mankind and finally taking down Anti-Spirals. Each part focuses on a different concept and idea. As the series moves on, we mature along with the main character Simon, and the themes tackled gets more mature and adult-themed as well. I particularly liked the arc that slightly antagonised Rossiu, for he was the only one with the rational mind and the strong heart to make hard decisions. I liked the fact that the show not only portrayed humans truthfully (to put someone in the blame after something major happens), it also depicted the harsh reality of leadership and politics. Being at the top and satisfying everyone's demands is never an easy feat, and this show reminded me of this fact.\nThe concept of \"drills\" is also such a well-written theme. Starting off as Simon the Digger and how he was good at digging, it evolved to not just an action, but an adjective that represented the very soul of Simon. \"My drills would create the heavens\", \"My drill is my soul\", these words repeatedly being uttered never failed to send chills, and it filled the characters and the audience with so much hope. Yes, there are moments when life tries to send us to utter despair, but you have to believe, believe in the people who believe in you, and stand up there with the strength to take down the sky, the universe. It is this spirit that bonds and spirals everyone together, for them to overcome the anti-spirals and take down the ultimate antagonist. And I really loved this revolving theme. Adds a lot of good quotes to my list ;)\nFinally, the animation. Oh boy. I only know Gainax from NGE, but bOY was the animation for this SOLID. There is never a moment of sloppy animation, and the staff honestly put in so much effort to delivering the most quality sequences. They do defy laws of sciences, but let's be real. This is a fiction, and this is animation, which allows freedom of exaggerations that live actions can never hope to achieve. And it gives such a human essence to the mechas, and I honestly love it for that. If I find an art book in the future, I'm definitely buying it. "},

Who the hell do you think I am?!\nTo be clear, this anime has it's flaws, but it embraces them and doesn't try to hide them, in fact, it often parades them around as if saying \"and what are you going to do about it?!\" It's an anime that has a deeper meaning, and shoves it down your throat every chance it gets, but it is also a very mature message and takes the time to properly build that message and it's characters. So\n          \n        let's break it down.\nStory: 10/10\nThe anime does a tremendous job developing a worthwhile story that is both incredibly enjoyable and also a valuable life lesson. The plot is shot with holes like material being born literally ex nihilo, or later on, quantum theory very terribly (and wrongly) explained, but then it shoves your face in each hole and asks how it is important to the development of the story...and you really don't have an answer so you shut up and wet your pants in awe.\nArt: 8/10\nFor the most part, the art is beautifully done, and the proportions are all good (mostly) but it becomes obvious when there is an episode they don't particularly care about, or a scene that was rushed. So I can't honestly give this section a 10. That said, when the art is good (it usually is) it's great, down to the small details.\nSound: 10/10\nI watched the dubbed version, but I had subtitles, and I have to say, the dub was done remarkably well. There were a couple lines I can remember where I wish they had kept to the original words, but that is entirely excusable. The voices were all perfect fits for the characters, the sound effects were fittingly overdone, and the emotions were well expressed. The opening and endings were also both very good and well choreographed; they were very fitting and set the mood well.\nCharacter: 9/10\nI instantly fell in love with Kamina. He was the perfect overbearing older brother type. My love for Simon came slower, but his development was handled well, not so slow as to become painful, but not so fast that i don't have time to care. Yoko was kind of in the middle, it took me a few episodes to warm up to her, but she proved herself invaluable as well (being a tsundere helped too). My only qualm with the characters was that more could have been done with Yoko and a few other key characters, but no harm, no foul.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nMy beard danced when they were happy, and my chest hairs receded when they were sad. I don't think I have seen a show with such a direct line to my manly heart like this one. When they were depressed, I almost wanted to stop watching, and when they weren't I couldn't put it down.\nBut seriously, watch this show\nSide effects may include: premature puberty, beard growth in women, increased sperm count in men, increased sperm count in women, and death.\n        "},

Well, I DO SO MANY TIMES. WHENEVER I WATCH GOOOOOOOD ANIMEZZZ AND SUPERB ASIAN DRAMAZZZ, I ALWAYS WISH LOCAL CHANNELS HERE IN THE PHIL. WONT HAVE ANY INTEREST ON THESE SHOWS. YEZ, I KNOW, THESE GREAT SHOWS DESERVE A GREATER AUDIENCE TO APPRECIATE THEM AND EVENTUALLY CREATE A HUGE FOLLOWING, BUT, I KNOW I'M ON MY SELFISHNEST WITH REGARDS TO THESE..\nGreat anime and dramas became highlights of my happy memories that is why\n          \n        I don't want these shows to be taken for granted.....BUT..........NOT WITH THIS ONE....Ya, DEFINITELY, not this one!\nTENGEN TOPPA GURREN LAGANN deserves to be told to the whole world. Its story is  history itself. It surely is why OSAMU TEZUKA-SAMA created ANIME. Titles like TTGL is the reason why ANIMEZ KEEP ON ROCKING.....ROCKING OUR LIVESSS! AND I KNOW EVERBODY FEEL THE SAME WAY TOO. \nGurren Lagann, yeah as you know, started with a sssssssuuuuppppperrrrrrr sllllooooowwwwwww pace. And thanks to all reviews (all positive reviews!) that I've read for this one, I kept holding on until I figured out the cause of all the hype from this anime. I've also read a spoiler that one of the main characters will die, so I'm always on the look out for that one....but I, MYSELF AND I, was so SURPRISED AND TOTALLY HAD A GOOSE BUMPED when that dying scene came right in front me. MY GOSH! Why does such a thing happened when you're starting to build up a particular center of attention that will make you want to watch it more, I mean, you know the chemistry between the-great-ex-hero of the show and Yoko-oneechan....hUHUHUHU....i totally cried when that unexpected battle cry came out. Though it was a really very upsetting moment, I know to myself this is where the REAL JOURNEY BEGIN! And so it goes...\nWe came to meet Nia-chan. I actually liked her character because she gave another spice to the story although she had her own ways of annoying me, though I can't think of any in particular. But whenever I see her Picture, I can't help myself remembering that very bittersweet moment at the end.. Yeah,,,FYI, I'm now beginning to cry....I'm gonna tell you now my general reaction to the show...\nGurren Lagann, is kinda 2 seasons in 1. Because, there was the obvious building up saga before the grown up era. But, of course, you wont realize it yet before you could actually get into half of the story. While watching the show, I kinda had a thought and question in my mind.......HOW COULD SUCH AN ANIME COMBINE ALL THE GOOD ELEMENTS OF AN INTENSIFYING SERIES INTO ONLY 27 EPISODES? and another season wont be of any necessary? \nThat was then I came to remember all the animes i used to watch in the afternoon when i was still in elementary and were always in a hurry just to never get late watching them. These hard-core animez include GUNDAM WING, yU YU hAKUSHO,Gundam G, bTX, tHUNDER jeT, dRAGON bALL, NInja Robots, and so many animes full of my good memories..***sigh*** That is why, I think Gurren Lagann must be a source of a good memory also to others, especially those who are otaku-in the making. I want this one to be a part of the afternoon-must watch to the younger generation of my country because mine's was so special and I want them to feel it too. \nNow, after that suppppppppperrrrrrr sllllllllllllooooooooooooowwwwww beginning of the series, I couldn't believe I was really taken aback. I slept last night still thinking of the bittersweet memories from this anime. And yes, it was really enough reason to become proud of your SPECIAL TITLE - OTAKU! \nI'm sorry I couldn't write any particular things about the anime: the story, the characters, the sound and other etcczzz..Because I was lost...really lost...can't just simply put it into simpler terms or digest it into particular category...its effect was really overwhelming, words of surreality are only coming out from my mind.\nSo superb. period.\nP.S.\nI like to see happily ever after at the end of each story, because fantastical sweetness still lives on me. But, after watching the Endless Love series, I found another meaning of sweetness. Love doesn't have to be lived by two persons physically because love grows over longest distance, may it HEAVEN or HELL. Love Moves In Mysterious Ways. Though, I dislike seeing those sad endings, it creates a more tender and deeper meaning of LOVE.\nLONG LIVE SIMON AND NIA!!\nFrom a-proud-to-be-otaku!,\nMe ^_^\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This is my opinion. I know there are people who are disappointed about his anime, but this is what I must say.\nThere is nothing I disliked about this anime. Everything is well made and there is nothing that can match its hype. At first I got curious about it and began watching it. I have regretted not watching it earlier. I loved it from the first episode until its finale. Fans of mecha animes will definitely see something new about it because of the fact that every robot in this anime has a big face. Gainax really made it well which I think to make\n          \n        up for Neon Genesis Evangelion which for me sucked too much.\nIt is something that I have never seen on any anime so far, It has the right length of episodes and not something that will take years to be completed, The pace is just right and doesn't bore you, and finally, it is the most memorable anime I have ever seen so far.\nStory\nJust one word, \"SIMPLE\". It is simple to understand and doesn't irritate viewers. Some animes out there have very complicated story line that irritates the viewers but this anime has very simple story which maybe a bit predictable but then again fun to watch as it doesn't really need to explain a lot.The first episode is epic which will make you crave for more. \nArt\nThe art is a bit cartoony but this is what separates this anime with the others. The robots have freaking huge faces which is one of the charms of this anime, characters are well drawn and animated. It doesn't need 3D animation or cel shaded graphics, it is simple and entertaining. \nSound\nThe opening song sticks to your head the very first time you hear it. I even have the whole song into my MP3 player and became no.1 most played. Libra me from hell is amazing. Ending songs mix well with the anime. The music captures you the first time you hear it.\nCharacter\nThere are only 4 at most memorable characters, Kamina, Simon, Nia, And Yoko. Others are well support types but everyone of them has different personalities which compliments the other. The most memorable as you have read the other reviews is Kamina. He is the only character that really makes an impact throughout the series as the leader of the Gurren Brgade.\nEnjoyment\nI really enjoyed watching it. It has the right amount of humor, romance, action and tragedy which really made the anime an epic. The robots can show emotions which really can make you laugh at times. Gurren Lagann's main weapon is a drill really separates it from other robots because usually they use a sword as a main weapon. I mean when is the last you've seen a drill as a main weapon in an anime. Mine was when I was watching Steam Detective.\nOverall\nThis anime is an epic. Everything from characters to robots is memorable. For me so far, no anime in this time has ever matched it well. This is must watch anime.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Do you like giant robots, exaggerated explosions, and manly dialogue? How about egregiously large amounts of fan service, unique character designs and adrenaline-pumping music? Then Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann might just be the anime for you. I could vomit out a million praises in pertinence to the greatness of Gurren Lagann, but for now let's slow things down a bit and cover each area one by one, shall we?\nFirst of all, let's begin with Gurren Lagann's story. To be honest, the story is a typical \"Coming of Age\" tale, and wouldn't exactly be anything special if it weren't for the fantastic staff of characters. It\n          \n        also follows the very cliche idea of a hero saving the earth from some insurmountable danger; however, this is not to say that it doesn't pull this cliche off well, because, quite simply, it does. \nI mean, if it's not broke, don't fix it, right? (I'm sure that phrase alone has slaughtered the creativity of many individuals, many times.)\nAlthough Gurren Lagann's story in itself is nothing spectacularly unique or awe-inspiring, the many sub-textual messages delivered throughout the course of the story are pronounced and undoubtedly profound. I found myself noticing a very humanistic side of Gurren Lagann at some parts, and at others an obvious message of unwavering perseverance. All of these elements melt together to make what we know today as Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann; however, the story is only a portion of what makes Gurren Lagann a masterpiece. The art of Gurren Lagann also plays an important part.\nThe art in Gurren Lagann is epic. Everything seems to follow a not-so-subtle \"drill\" theme, and the art is no exception. Mechs sometimes have so many drills that you're wondering why they're even necessary, until you're drilled into an awe-inspired silence. Then you willingly suspend disbelief like a good viewer and enjoy the rest of the show. \nNonetheless, even with this odd theme, Gurren Lagann's animation is smooth, impressive and, at times, stunning. There are several points where the art style changes, but there is only one instance I can recall in the entire series where this is a bad thing; however, this one instance is enough to bring the score down to a nine. After this event, the art simply returns to normal, as if the series had never experienced a lapse in animation quality.\nIf you can't quite rip yourself away from that one instance in the anime where the animation is lacking (Episode four, if memory serves), awkward, and, quite frankly, dreadful, then you're soon silenced by the overwhelmingly emotional soundtrack that Gurren Lagann has to offer. The musical pieces in Gurren Lagann are always well placed and never seem intrusive to any event in the story. The opening and endings for the series are enjoyable and downright catchy. You will undoubtedly find yourself becoming very emotional listening to some of the songs on this soundtrack, whether it be the hot-blooded musical piece that plays at various inspirational points in the series, or the sorrowful, tear-jerking piano that plays at others. However, glorious though it may be, even Gurren Lagann's great soundtrack pales in comparison to the single most attractive feature of the series--the characters.\nThe characters in Gurren Lagann are so large in number, so lasting in memory, and so vivid in expression that I'm eager to say that they are some of most developed, likable characters in any anime that I've seen. Boasting a large staff of twenty-five characters (not counting antagonists), Gurren Lagann has some of the most unique characters to be seen. At many points, as I was re-watching Gurren Lagann, I would mutter quietly to myself or to a friend of mine that \"this character only gets more awesome later.\" And it's true. Every character has some important role to play in the series. Some are exclusively comic relief, and some are your typical fan service suppliers, but all of them work together to make an inseparable, unforgettable cast. I still, even as I write this, marvel at how amazing some of the minor characters were, and how impressive and influential the main characters were. \nOf course, like any anime, the characters played a major hand in how enjoyable the series was overall. \nAnd how enjoyable was it? I'm not afraid to say that it is the single most enjoyable anime I have ever seen. At some points I was so emotional that I thought I could cry (admittedly, I did), and at other points I was so riled up that I yelled out loud in my bedroom; much to the dismay of my family. (I believe my exact words were something along the lines of \"F*CK YEAH!\") There were no points in Gurren Lagann where I was dissuaded from watching the next episode. Even the aforementioned lapse in animation had its humorous points that kept me watching. \nOverall, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is great for any avid anime viewer. It's like you're in heaven for 27 episodes (and hell for one), but then you realize that Gurren Lagann is much too large to be constricted to mere celestial environments, and you find yourself looking up as it continues to rise, without hesitation, to the realm that all great anime eventually end up in. \nSo, if you happen to see Gurren Lagann at a store, or even online, I urge you to immediately indulge yourself and experience one of the more recent jewels in anime history. And if you find yourself sad when you finish the series, don't worry! There are a couple of movies, too! Both of which recap the series with even better visuals, manly dialogue and fan service! \nI hope this review has persuaded at least a few of you to consider watching Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann in all of its mecha splendor, and if you happen to dislike Gurren Lagann for some reason, I hope you don't hold it against me. \nThat being said, enjoy!\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    One of the biggest flaws of this anime is the plot. The ideology that Gurren Lagann proposes is that if you yell and scream with blind passion, you will overcome all odds. This is shown first with Kamina, his facade of confidence and certainty is what allowed everybody - Simon, Yoko, the Gurren Brigade - to defeat their enemies time and time again. Simon transitions into a similar role as Kamina's. There are many moments in this anime where success seems impossible, yet Simon yells and becomes confident in his own success, and somehow he becomes successful. This success is noted as being the Power\n          \n        of the Spiral, but the further I went in to the anime the more and more I saw Simon and the Gurren Brigade overcoming these impossible situations. I feel the creators of this anime made the plot unbelievable in order for the Brigade to be successful, which I feel is the biggest handicap on the anime.\nThe plot is only one segment of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, and I must say that I really did enjoy this anime. The characters, especially Kamina, are really fun watch. The boldness and confidence of these characters when they really should have none is what makes them so interesting. There are also some very interesting views on humanity and how we act, one of which being the protest scene with everyone demanding compensation for their homes from the government, as if the government was responsible for the damage.  The midway intro/outro art is very cool. \nOverall, this is a feel good not to serious anime where you just have fun with it. You don't need to become depressed with sad story lines or confused with the the complexity of the plot, all you have to do is have fun. I recommend watching it, you'll probably enjoy it.\nOverall: 8.5\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I...... Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is no doubt my most favorited anime, ever. Yes I dare to say ever because.... because.... this anime is just so unique in his own way. And in one series, 27 episodes, I can swear I could feel almost every emotions got mixed up in my mind. Everything-- sad, angry, touched, happy, laughing my ass out, mindf*cked, super shocked...\nSo what qualities does this anime have, that makes me regard this series so highly? I'm gonna describe every single thing.\nFirst of all, it's definitely the story. The main plot looks pretty original to me; a group of people staying underground while\n          \n        some rebels declare that someday they're gonna go up and see the sky! I got easily hooked after I watched the first episode, and what happens next never disappoints me. After they finally go up from the underground, lots of things began to happen (I'm not gonna spoil anything). The battles are just interesting and makes us eager to watch more. Moreover, it's not all about mecha, fighting skills, fantasy, or man-to-man bond, but we also have some of....... romance! Yes, romance! To me, romance is never boring (even though there's always these typical triangle love or something), but instead it makes the story becomes more interesting and the bond between the characters eventually grows. Even though romance is not particularly the main plot of the story, the romance becomes more important as the story goes on, and thanks to the romance, watchers could relate themselves more to the story, and results in making the story even realer! Without romance, this story would be just plain and... tasteless. Whoops, not gonna spoil anything. Just watch and you're gonna understand.\nBesides romance, every scenes in this anime are just-- awesome. In 27 episodes, they could divide the stories into some parts with just the perfect length of episodes that no scenes are too long nor too short. Everything is just perfect. And even though the story could be considered complicated (and might be frustrating) in the middle til the end... you can just sit back, relax while enjoying the thrilling sensation and your wild heartbeat. This is the real thrill!\nSecond, is the art. The art is so clean and, to me, beautiful. The robots look cool-- yes, every robots. The character design is also awesome, with cute girls and macho boys (even though there's these slight fanservices of our main woman character). And... let me spoil a little bit, because in the end TTGL battles would be presented in outer space, the outer space was also cool! It's like looking on the night sky, with dark surroundings and sparkling stars. And all the mecha-related stuffs were also great.\nThen, the sound. Nothing much to say about the sound, but I really like the opening and ending songs, especially the 2nd ending, Minna no Peace. The seiyuus were also good, they fit the personality of each character.\nThen we have... characters!! Characters is the second best aspect of this anime after the story. Well like some other series, we have Simon, a timid guy as our #1 main character with his companion whom he calls Aniki-- Kamina, a strong and a brave man. Kamina is a really interesting individual, because he's.... the manliest among all men!! He's so brave that sometimes he becomes reckless, and he is willing to do anything to reach his goal. He's no doubt Simon's role model (because Simon is like 180 degrees different from Kamina), and Kamina also taught Simon lots of things. One thing I personally like is his wondrous quotes-- some of them are the common one like 'WHO THE HECK DO YOU THINK I AM?' until the most original one, \"Don't believe in yourself, believe in me who believes in you!!\". There are still lots and lots more of his quotes that you'll get to find out when you watch this.\nBesides Kamina, we have Simon. Simon's personality and existence doesn't particularly stand out because of Kamina, but as time goes on, he began to mature himself and becomes a true man. Even though he's sometimes intimidated by Kamina's super power and great leadership, and also lots of things happen in his life, he took everything that he had experienced to his strength and then becomes stronger, stronger, much stronger, that in the end he is completely worth to call this anime's hero. Surely, he had ups and downs, but he's still an awesome man that has been through everything and stands up in the end as a respectful leader.\nThe last, enjoyment is top notch. Because; this series will get your emotions mixed even if you're not as emotional as me. There will surely be a time that you'll get so touched that you cry, you're so pissed of that you're screaming, you're so hyper that you're laughing out loud, you're super confused, mindblowns, etc. To me, the feeling I had when I watched this was the best feeling. So, I gave overall 10 out of 10 to this stunning masterpiece.\n        "},

BUT once again she doesn't get on your nerves because she constantly believes in simon and is pretty damn strong on her own.\nthe only possible weakness for this anime is the music, but even then it surpasses most.  the songs by shouko nakagawa don't sound like anything special, but the opening eventually grew on me (it could be the awesome graphics that went with it).  the background music for this anime though is AMAZING, which is why sound earned a 9 even though i didn't like the openings and endings that much (they're still on my ipod though...haha).  i LOVE \"Libera Me from Hell\"...it's such a fitting and great piece for the intense action scenes.  \nactually, you know what, im giving sound a 10 after all.  i just love \"libera me from hell\" that much.  \nStory - 10\nArt - 10\nSound - 10 \nCharacter -10\nEnjoyment - 10\nOverall - 100000000000000000000\n        "},

Compared to some other animes, this one should be at the top. It is very interesting and anyone will just love it.\nThis anime takes place in a barren world, where humans are forced to live underground. The protagonist, Simon, and his soul brother, Kamina, break the ceiling of their village and reach the surface. A new friend, named Yoko, helps them a lot throughout the adventure. It is very tasteful in some parts, and very funny in others.\nThe art in this anime is amazing. The artist adds some techniques not\n          \n        seen in any other anime, and it is very effective. The fight scenes in TTGL are very nice, where in the last few episodes, much of the producing money was used for the animating.\nThe sound is very nice. Some sounds could be tuned up a bit, but overall, it makes the anime awesome. They even put music in the final scenes, and that makes it all the better. The opening and ending songs are very good, and I enjoyed all of them.\nThe characters are some of the best ones I've ever seen. Simon was developed very well. First, he was very nervous and relied on Kamina. Then, he started to grow up and become braver. At the end, he was out-going and brave like Kamina. He even did some things better. Rossiu started out like Simon, and then he became wiser, except when he did some things that he shouldn't have done :D. Yoko did not develop that much, but she started out very demanding.\nI enjoyed this anime a lot. The best part of this anime is the overkill. The giga drill breaker, the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, the sheer size of everything is what makes this anime enjoyable. The size of many attacks are just overpowered, and the size of some bots make everything epic and top of the line.\nOverall, this anime is my top anime. I still cannot find an anime better than this one.\n        "},

I started as a mere normal boy who had only been exposed to DBZ on Toonami and Pokemon on Cartoon Network.  Most people start out at anime level 1-4 for their first, and apparently I started out with probably the most stereotypically anime anime in existence.\nThere was enough cheese to sustain France for 2 centuries, but\n          \n        by god it was the tastiest cheese I have ever had.  It was like the anime version of the heavy metal band Manowar:  Utterly shameless in how indulgent in cliche it is, taking itself seriously only just enough that it can put out an excellent product and then go \"Look at how batsh*t insane this is, and enjoy the living hell out of it because that's what it's here for.\"\nTTGL is an epic, unrestrained romp from one immensely entertaining trope to the next with total disregard for what anyone might think of it to the point where that is one of its most endearing features.\nI'd watch it again, I really would.  It's just a blast.  You let go, stop caring, enjoy the endless tsunami of cheesiness and grab on for the ride, because by the end of it you'll just be awestruck that you are where you are considering the starting point.\n10/10, complete s***storm of epic\n        "},

Couldn't ever know an anime would be so epic with such few episodes, this is the real thing! This Tengen Toppa!\nIt all starts with Simon and Kamina, brothers in soul, both willing to understand reasons of being imprisoned underground. Questioning their lives, they struggle everyday to see the light of day and when that happens, oh boy, things begin to get to a totally different level.\nAt first, battles are focused on survival, but soon more and more reasons appear and getting answers is a priority. As humans discover their fighting potential, they\n          \n        become able to defeat more and more beastmen, after stealing their mechas (gunmen), expanding the small group created by Kamina and Simon to a huge army.\nFormidable foes appear one after another and the main mecha, Gurren Lagann just keeps evolving over and over, getting stronger and more stronger. Power doesn't have limits, just put your faith on it and no one will ever dare to challenge you!\nAnd when the plot changes, that's where my rating went straight to 10, because it simply turns into an incredible masterpiece. When everything looks impossible and all hope is gone, a way to win the battle and keep fighting is found, so never give up!\nAll those unique, classic looking mechas, simply amazing! There are tons of intense, explosive battles, who doesn't like that? And seeing how Gurren Lagann turns itself into an incredibly powerful mecha... Priceless! And the ending? Well, just the best I've ever saw! Surely, epicness in here may be much more than what you would be ever able to find on any other anime!\nSacrifices need to be made so others may continue their journey, so yes, sad moments are obviously present in here and I got my share of tears on this one...\nSo, if you still didn't watch TTGL, what are you waiting for? Join me on this epic adventure, where boys become men, searching for something they should never know, just on an attempt to live and see the world as it really is! Simply the best!"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    From the makers of FLCL, brings us Gurren Lagann, a mecha anime that I thought had one of the best written anime stories of the decade (2000-2009). The story really has three big acts. The first one (eps. 1-8) being the best, the second, (eps.9-15) and the third (17-27) being very good. Episode 16 is a recap.\nWhere most of humanity is trapped underground, two orphans, Simon and Kamina, find there way towards the surface, along side Yoko Littner, a girl who has lived there for some time team up with a large group of friends they meet along the way. Together they are determined to\n          \n        defeat \"beastmen\", non-spiral beings who are capable of controlling Gunmen, the robots that make this a mecha anime. The \"beastmen\" are lead by Lord Genome, (Spiral King). He was the guy who created them, and was the main antagonist for most of the time in the series.\nIn the second act, Theres a lot of good drama. We see Simon being very confident in what he has to do and Yoko being very sad. Also, Simon kind of has a love interest as well with a mysterious new character Nia, who is suppose to be Lord Genome's (Spiral King) daughter. The big and best battle begins when Simon fights against the Spiral King.\nTowards the end of the series, things get a little weird but still maintains its awesome-ness. There is a time lapse where our Simon has grown into a man. His girl Nia turns into a psychotic android who wants to destroy all of the spirals, the fictional energy that everybody has. Rossiu is an idiot and Viral, a beastman, turns good and fights with Simon. And best of all Yoko is a teacher!!\nThis is definitely one of my favorite animes of all time. I loved the characters, the relationships, and most of all the story. The only criticisms I'd give it is that the music could of used some improvement and the animation may be hard to follow for some. But again, it was amazing. Even if you don't like mecha anime, you should watch it.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Thought writing a review might be fun, so I stepped up to the challenge. I'll try to keep this short and sweet.\nStory (8/10): The series as a whole was enjoyable, however I believe the main flaw of the story is that it is too predictable. Enemies that were not eliminated will come back later in the series stronger yet to take you on again, or join forces with you. When one gets taken down, an even stronger one awaits the protagonists. You know they would win, but it was only a matter of how they go about it. \nArt & Sound (10/10): No flaws to\n          \n        point out. I truly enjoyed this style of drawing. Sounds were amazing as well. I always am waiting for the intermission (in the middle of episodes) where they would flash two artworks and play some really catchy tune.\nCharacter (8/10): Throughout the show, the only thing TTGL keeps reminding me of is Haru from Accel World. Simon may not be fat like him, but personality-wise they always have to take a real harsh beating before getting into “ragemode” and then trashing their enemies. Perhaps this is the “Spiral Power/Human Spirit” that fuels them, but it feels a little… cheesy, no? \nEnjoyment (9/10): Even with the main flaws I pointed out above, I found the show extremely enjoyable to watch. Many times I find the show childish and cliché (like “Who the hell do you think I am?”), but some of those scenes place a smile on my face. If I had to point out the most enjoyable part, it would have to be the second arc where the main characters have grown up with slight changes in personality and a bit of politics incorporated into the show. \nOverall (9/10): All in all, I would give it a 9/10. I would definitely recommend this to a casual anime watcher or someone who just started watching anime, because this show doesn't look serious, yet is, when the time comes."},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    (warning possible spoilers ahead)\nThis won't be the greatest review of this show ever, but I feel like this is a point I have to get across. For quite some time, Code Geass Season 1 had been regarded as my favorite anime of all time. But after finishing Gurren Lagann, my opinions started to change. There is something about this show that 'drills' a nail into my heart and leaves me with a sad, but happy feeling inside.\nThe characters you come to form relationships with in Gurren Lagann start off living their lives underground. They then start to live there lives as surface dwellers and after\n          \n        seven years or so, they then end up in space. I can't help but feel both sadness and happiness in this case because the characters you meet accomplish so many things and go through so many changes. They go from living in the dark ages to living in a more futuristic setting.\nSpeaking of characters, I would say that is Gurren Lagann strongest point. The people you meet. Kamina having to be my favorite just because of the impression he left on me as a whole. Everyone needs to be like Kamina. He had dreams and he went for them. He inspires everyone around him, and hates to see peoples confidence downgrade. Simon (I'm not gonna lie), I couldn't find him interesting until around 8 episodes in. By that time, Kamina dies and Simon's left wondering about how he guides himself in life. He gets over Kamina's death eventually, which shows his character developement and as a result, I found Simon to become a more interesting person in general. Yoko is also another charming character along with Roissu, Viral, Leeron and even Kittan. \nThe music is fantastic. You will grow to love Liberia From Hell, because trust me, you will not get the Lyrics \"RAW RAW, FIGHT THE POWER\" out of your head. I can't exactly remember what this track was called, but there was a scene where Kamina and Yoko kiss ontop of a cliff and that piece of music right there was enough to convince me that the soundtrack was phenomenal. Heck the scene got to me even more when I found out that Kamina gets killed off about 10 minutes later. Without a doubt my favorite piece of music.\nThe art style was certainly different from other anime I had watched like Tokyo Ghoul and Assasination Classroom. I more talking about the intervals between the show. They show off this cool and funky picture of whatever is happening in the show currently. There's not much to say about this picture, its just funky! \nThis show is intended to not be serious and had me laughing from beginning to end. Everyone should be treated to this show if they haven't seen it already, because it truly is special. Would I want to see a second season? Absolutley not. For how amazing this show is, there isn't much left to tell after the final fight. Life goes on for the rest of the cast members and were all left looking back on how far these characters have come. Do not over look this Anime. You will heavily regret it if you do!\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="                          \n    Gurren Lagann simply gets better as the episodes progress. Not because of exponential growth of the various \"arcs\" (starting from an underground shelter to fighting in various spacial dimensions), but rather because of the contagious kickass spirit that penetrates throughout the entire anime.\nI'm not gonna lie, the first 4 episodes were quite boring, and I had the show on hold for quite a while. However, once I started watching the show again, I fell in love with (most of) it.\n---SPOILERS BEWARE===\nKickass Kamina - what a fucking character. Now, I really, really hated that they killed him off early on in the show because I thought\n          \n        that he was the only character worth watching the show for. I changed my mind. Not because there are other characters who surpass him, but because his death actually had a indelible effect on the anime. But the more the show goes on, the more you grow to respect Kamina and miss his limitless inspirational aura. \nDeath - A lot of good characters end up dying in the show, all till the every end. Now, the deaths aren't especially grim or bloody like some other shows. Rather, for a show that I thought was made for 6 year olds, these deaths go quite far in demonstrating the fickleness of human life. In other words, despite the love and attachment that you have for those alive, that can be taken away instantly without any purview at all. And all you can do in those situations is live on.\nNo evil - Kind of a side observation on my end, but there really is no evil side in the show. Once the explanations begin to happen after each arc, you see that both sides always have good justifications for their actions. \nOverall, I really love the can-do attitude in the show. \n\"Go beyond the impossible and kick reason to the curb! That's how Team Gurren rolls!\" - Kamina"},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="                          \n    There will be spoilers, so just be warned:\nThis was an anime that came highly recommended from a few friends and to be honest despite its popularity I had never heard of it before. It's critically acclaimed by a lot of anime fans and I can understand why but despite how beloved it is, it did have its problems but thankfully the problems were so minor that it did not ruin the anime for me.\nLet's focus on the bad first, and then we'll move onto the good.\nMecha based anime tend to be my favorite anime of all time. Personally I prefer anime that focuses on mecha,\n          \n        power suits, or futuristic machinery. I've watched quite a few mecha based anime and it is safe for me to say that I think Gurren Lagann has some of the most ugliest mech designs I've ever seen. I feel horrible for saying it, but I just couldn't get into the giant faces that a lot of the mecha had. In all honesty the only visually appealing mecha was first form gurren lagann or the gurren lagann mecha that the little kids were using in the second half of the season. I think the story was too big to cram into 27 episodes. There was a lot of story to tell, and it completely took me off guard and to a point annoyed me that at around the halfway point, they fast forward 7 years. Like what the hell. I will be the first to admit I did enjoy the first part of the series much more than the second part because at the beginning I was getting into it. It was fast paced, it was hilarious, and just a lot of the character chemistry was really well done, and I was well on my way to giving this anime a perfect score. The villains were established, the goal was simple, all the characters were likable to an extent, and every episode just left you with a good feeling by the end of it. Then a character died in the series, way way too early if you ask me. This is one of the reasons why I would of rather preferred if this anime was put into two seasons instead of just one. This character death literally deflated the energy of this anime so badly. It was full steam ahead and when this happened, it completely took me out of it and it really took a while to get myself interested in it again. Was this character's death needed in order to progress the plot and give the characters more depth - absolutely, but it simply came way too early in the series. It also didn't help that another one of my favorite characters in the series died at the very end as well. It was hard to feel sad about both characters deaths because I felt they could of used more time to develop their characters better, but rest assured whatever screen time they did have - they definitely took advantage of it. I think the final gripe I had with the anime was the final battle. It got really silly, I know at the end they had to save the universe and the entire universe was their battlefield, but using planets as bombs and entire galaxies as destructo discs - give me a break. There's absurd which is totally expected in anime, but then there is stupidly absurd which is exactly the best way to sum up the final battle. Those were my main problems with it.\nLet's focus on the good.\nThe biggest thing going for this anime is that despite the fact that I did not like the look of the mech designs, it does have some of the best mech fights (minus the final battle) I've ever had the pleasure of watching in any anime. Gurren Lagann's drill mechanic was an interesting touch on developing his attack moves and it just made the fights that much more enjoyable even though there were times that I felt Gurren Lagann was simply too overpowered for the rest of his competition. The fights against the four generals and in the first half of the season were some of the best action packed episodes in the entire series compared to the anti-spirals in the second half that lacked any real imagination. Despite the fact that I would of enjoyed the series more if it was two seasons, the pacing of this anime was incredibly well done even during times of tragedy where the episodes were a little slower - probably some of the best pacing I've seen out of all the anime I've watched. Simon was okay for the main character (He had some good moments but he also had some intolerable moments as well), but he was completely outshone by other members of the team. Despite the unexpected time jump, the overall message of the anime, and its philosophical messages about our place in universe blended in really well with the underlying plot and the second seasons transition of how truly large the world is and our importance in it gave a great sense of scale when it came to what was on the line and what needed to be protected. The opening song is a great song, but i wasn't particularly fond of the ending songs in the anime. Despite not liking the final battle, it did end in a really great way because there were a lot of deaths in the final few episodes of the anime and they were absolutely needed because it showed you what people were willing to do in order to win this battle. I really loved the the final few scenes in the series and its probably where I liked simon the best because it fast forward much later in the future and I really liked simon's approach to the life that he wanted to live.\nMy favorite episode is the episode where after the first war against the beastmen, yoko decided to settle down and become a school teacher and despite this episode being a little light on the action. It had a lot of heart behind it.\nMy final verdict:\nFirst Half (Funnier, Better Action, Better Villains, Better Pacing) > Second Half (More Philosophical, Grander Scale, Moodier)\nMost Favorite Characters: Kamina, Kittan, Yoko\nLeast Favorite Characters: Rossiu, Leeron\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Famous and terrific Studio Gainax hit big with this anime. This is the same studio that brought the world top anime such as Evangelion (1995) and Gunbuster (1988). Tasked with directing this action packed show was Hiroyuki Imaishi whom is a long standing key animator on a slew of shows ranging from Evangelion to FLCL. Needless to say, this guy knows his action and crazy lighting. The real question now lies, how could a super robot show be any good outside of the 1970’s?\nGurren Lagann begins in an underground society where human basically live like moles. Our story’s main hero is a young boy named\n          \n        Simon. Together with his adopted emotionally eccentric big brother Kamina dream of going to the surface. Well, Simon is rather timid without aspirations in life other than digging, but idolizes Kamina and what he represent. One day, a beautiful spit-fire girl named Yoko busts into their society from above revealing the surface and the world outside. It is then and there where Simon and company must fight off a mysterious enemy and ultimately save mankind.\nTo put it simply, this is a super robot show that is very self-aware. Each episode is essentially a monster-of-the-week formula, but does it in a way where it is just plain fun. It really revives the formula of what made the super-robot genre so popular in the past. The story is split into two halves. The first is the discovery and gaining back the surface from humanoid animal creatures known as “Beastmen” whom control giant beast robots. The second half is a time-skip where the same group from the first half slowly unravel and fight off a mystery involving the universe and destruction of mankind.\nAnimation throughout Gurren Lagann is smooth and glossy with a lot of vibrant greens to show off. This is not just another mecha series. Sure, the series gets downright ridiculous at times, but with one simple solution it all makes simple sense. The Beastmen and their robots all vary giving a constant fresh take on the fun battles. The characters in the first half all have unique characteristics and small developments here and there. \nHowever, the series faults heavily in the second half where the cast and best characters are thrown away to the side in order to focus solely on Simon. Not saying the development of Simon and the story unfolding is not something great. It really is fantastic to see how a wimpy shy little boy overcomes hardships and becomes stronger and bleeds confidence. It truly is one of the best male protagonist development present in anime even though it is based on a simple concept. \nEven as the story gets more and more out of control, the viewer cannot help but join in on the crazy. The roller coaster keeps twisting and turning giving more and more. It is just a massive shame and negative mark on what made the cast of characters so enthralling in that first half is seemingly dismissed into convenient plot points, fan service, and weak writing.\nAs much cheese as the series has and the fun little plot twists, Gurren Lagann does do a well enough job explaining everything without introducing stupid new out of nowhere elements to advance plot. Even the ultimate climax is super-over-the-top leaves a bit of a shocking result.\nWhere the series ultimately is at fault is the weak character writing. Simon’s eventual love interest is awkwardly introduced after a pivotal character moment and plot line for the main cast. The story becomes awkward in itself around Nia as well instead of focusing on the mystery around her. A pivotal character is taken from the audience way too early in the series basically killing emotional lasting impact. Even another pivotal character disappears after the time skip only to be incredibly awkwardly introduced with a story halting and clashing flashback written into terrible convenience. \nUltimately, is Gurren Lagann a fantastic piece of anime? No, but it is the anime equivalent to an energy drink thrown into a giant robot with a crazy amount of catchy one-liners. It surely is an anime for everyone that just wants to have fun without having to worry about mind bending plots. Just believe in the me that says this is anime series worth watching.\n        "},

Gurren Lagann is like a dog owner who feeds his dog medicine by wrapping it in bacon: the show has an extremely powerful and important moral theme that is wrapped up in seemingly lowest-common-denominator-esque action in an effort to get us, the viewers, to hopefully digest what the show REALLY tries to tell us.\nThere's going to be a lot of coming-of-age themes and male anatomy metaphors in this show, and there will even be a minimal amount of fanservice. All of this easily distracts the typical viewer, including myself for the\n          \n        longest time, from the greatest aspect of this anime: it tells the quintessential story of a conflict between the progressive ethic and the conservative ethic. \nYou have a story in which a small population of people are kept in perpetual darkness, both literally and figuratively. All of their attempts to breach either darkness is met with hostile retaliation. The tone of the story is very reminiscent of Stark Trek in the idea that the characters are always reaching for newer frontiers, and how the greatest possible enemy of people in this show's universe is ignorance. Gurren Lagann is even optimistic like Star Trek despite having its dark moments and dark characters. \nOn top of it all, the show has an amazing, no-complaints ending. It's hard to find THAT in an anime. So go watch it already, or watch it again, then a third time.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    There were a few factors that compelled me to pick up this anime and start watching it:\n1) Mad Friends - when you're part of a small anime club at uni, and a bunch of your friends are raving about something, they're either very asian and nerdy, or they're actually onto something big.\n2) Gainax - haven't found anything by these guys yet that's disappointed me. 6 episodes of FLCL and a bunchload of EVA made me a happy chappy, so I thought Gurren Lagann would do the same.\nAnd to no surprise, Gainax shows off an amazing anime once again. \nYou might think, \"wow, just another mecha\n          \n        anime.\" True, Gurren Lagann utlises giant mecha as the form of combat in the story. But it's not all about giant robots of good and evil beating the crap out of one another.\nStory:\nUnlike FLCL and EVA, Gurren Lagann is an anime that has a start and a finish to it, which is clear, concise, has it's twisted moments, but is really fun to follow. \n   The story starts off in the underground world of a young boy (how predicatable, right?), Simon, who's only job everyday is to dig dig dig, expand the underground village. His parents were victims some years ago to the frequent earthquakes that occur in the underground communities, but is harbored by Kamina, a fellow orphen, who claims himself and Simon to be brothers by nature (not by blood). Kamina has an ambition to reach the unknown surface world, but due to the underground fear of the surface, Kamina is prohibited and restrained by the village elder. Things take a sudden turn when Simon discovers a spiral 'key' and a giant 'face' deep underground, and a giant 'ganmen,' a large, powerful, destructive robot, comes crashing through the roof, along with Yoko, a soldier of the resistance against the surface forces. The spiral key Simon discovers, actually powers the giant 'face' he found underground, along with his positive emotions. The face robot dubbed \"Lagann\" by Kamina, manages to defeat the violent Ganmen, and powers through to the surface, exposing Simon and Kamina (along with Yoko) to the magnificence of the surface world for the first time.\n   By the 3rd episode, we've already discovered the fusion power of the Lagaan, as well as capturing a bunch of other Ganmen. By the 7th episode, we've got a final boss in mind, a bunch of team mates, a laughs coming out of your ears. Ganmen are actually piloted by Beastmen, who are created by Lord Genome, who has a motive to keep humans in limited numbers underground. What could be the reasoning behind that?? \n   What's more with these robots, they seem to get....bigger. And bigger. Think russian dolls growing outward. Just prepare to laugh xD. The story definitely moves fast, as we see Simon overcome his boyish fears, the experience they all gain through fighting, and the realisation of the inner feelings we have for people we never thought we did. \n     Because the story manages to move so fast, the series is sort of split into two parts. Episodes 1-17 and 18-27 are different parts in time of the same story. That's right, they keep switching locations, and even time frames. Of course, you could probably guess already that the big bad Lord Genome is taken down by Simon and the like, but it seems trouble doesn't stop there =O! The second half of the series occurs seven years later, where our favourite characters are older and (hopefully) more mature, a great city has been built above the surface, and all Ganmen have been destroyed to  maintain peace. But a new intergalactic invasion of earth becomes apparent when the population of humans breached 1 million inhabitants. Why must humans be exterminated? Where did Simon's love go? What will they do?\n-> get bigger robots and head to outer space of course 8D! \n   Twists galore. But by the end of the series, you look back all the way to the start, thinking how far the story stretched. It covers a whole lifespan, and you see the growth and development of a boy, and how he helped the whole world around him follow suit. A resolved ending? Something like that.\nArt:\nYou get to witness all of Gainax's robotic awesomeness within the fight scenes, and colours of the lanscape within the emotional parts of the series. The only thing holding back a perfect score, was the general simplicity of colouring given to those slower parts. While this is very suitable for the anime and much easier on production schedules, it just bumps out the last little oomph. Artwork is still far above a majority of other titles.\nSound:\nI'm one of those people who like to experience English dubs as well as the Japanese original recordings of voices. Believe it or not, i'm very impressed a lot of the time with English dubs. This time around, this was the case.\n    Pulling back the 10, was the actual sountrack, however. Brilliant as it was, it was one of those soundtracks that I liked the more I listened to it, rather than getting a forceful surge of HOORAY the first time I heard it. Other than that, I love the music now xD.\nCharacters:\nDespite the large lack of female characters in this series, each character is given their very own personality we all adapt to and enjoy. From the shy Simon, to the spunky Yoko, awesome Kamina (no other way to describe him), committed Viral and the seedy/howthef*ckcanyouthinklikethat??? nature of all the villians. Each character is well defined, cleverly portrayed and skillfully illustrated.\n     Another thing I really enjoyed in terms of characters, was Simon's character development over the entire series. Very few story's are able to stretch out a personality change successfully over a long period of time - usually the character just hits a defining point in their lives, and suddenly their mentality is different. Simon changes bit by bit, every event has a consequence on his attitude. Kinda like what Shinji-EVA fans would've liked to see. \"Man the hell up and get on with it!!!!\" You gotta watch this, then =).\nOverall Enjoyment:\nI'm very pleased to say, this is one of the most enjoyable anime series i've had the pleasure of watching. From storyline, to character development, to artwork, action scenes, twists around the corner, and just overall unpredictability of what happens next just compelled me to keep watching more. Of course, likable characters made this very easy. \n      Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is one of those \"must see\" things you have to watch. \"I'll get around to watching it eventually\" you might be saying. Get the first episode, watch it right NOW. You won't stop until you reach the end =).\n        "},

This anime would literally leave  you  gaping and drooling and at the end; that's for those of you who do not shed manly tears or womanly. \nStory\nA few minutes into the first episode and I thought where would the story come from. I was thinking to myself perhaps this Mecha or \" Mecchi\"  anime was simply overrated like some few I have watched. Of course, I continued watching nonetheless, and each episodes kept me wanting to watch more. The story kept\n          \n        plunging in deeper and mystery kept building up, there was no way for me to stop. There are truly sad moments, epic ones and really funny moments in these anime. I am trying not reveal anything because this is anime has only 27 epic episodes , and that's what makes it brilliant( the suspense, mystery,comedy all  in 27). One more thing: you would really enjoy this anime if you like short fighting scenes. \nSound \nYou know those anime where the story is great and all that, and the sound or sound track is not so impressive, well (of course) this is not one of them. With each spectacular scene, comes a really fitting soundtrack; the kind of which gives you goose bumps and I am not exaggerating. Also, you know that intermediate breather  which anime take within episodes, this one has an amazing one.\nArt \nThe art is a simple and yet it really fits and kind of asserts the story-line and the characters as well\nCharacters \nI think every recurring  character in this anime has an endearing character so much so that I cannot say who my favorite character is. \nOverall, this anime isn't one those mediocre anime which a person manages through to the end. Since  One Piece,  I have not felt so emotional or engaged with the characters until this; I give it a nine not ten, because I don't think anything is 10/10 .\n        "},

A shy  young boy named Simon along with is very egoistic and manly friend Kamina, yearned to escape this underground to find this ‘surface’. Due to a number of events they befriend a girl named Yuko who came from the ‘surface’ as well as discover a robot that\n          \n        is known as a laggan. Finally being able to escape to the surface they discover that the surface wasn’t exactly the safest place to be and along with some new friends they fight to save humanity.\nOkay so it may sound like a pretty cliché story but trust me there is a lot more to it than it sounds there a lot of really inspiring quotes in this animation and the characters are all so flash and unique that you can’t help but love the artist the sceneries as well as the fighting scenes between the robots are really well done for a 2d animation and there were a lot of scenes that I thought the animators captured the moment perfectly. The English Dub is okay… but I personally thought the Japanese voice actors put more emotion into the acting.\nYes there is a bit of fan service for you guys who like boobs so don’t worry. =_=\nTears came trickling down my face countless times throughout this animation. Although some people may complain about the fact that the series was too short or too long or that plot unravelled way too quickly; but personally I thought they evened the story out rather well. it didn’t have any unnecessary scenes and I think if it dragged on any longer they would have ruined the ending.  Overall the animation was serious with just enough comedy to even up the tension and is recommended to teenagers and up because I think children wouldn’t really understand the content in some of the scenes.\n9.5/10 \n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Alright where to start, epic, bloody epic. Its an all out hype up action mecha anime done right. Personally I see this anime as a product of everything awesome Gainax can offer, its like evangelion, flcl and abenobashi blended together and fused with more greatness and the result is this, gurren lagann. Yes I enjoy this anime very much and this maybe exaggeration in my part but this anime will absolutely not disappoint any mecha fans out there who are unfortunate to have not experience the joyride this anime has to offer. What convince me to realize my love for gurren lagann is the effort\n          \n        poured into its production. Watch the 1st episode and you will realize it is a beautiful anime, the overall art, character design, the sound, the amount of soul the animators try to inject into the characters is just so right. Honestly I was hesitant when I first saw the cover art for gurren lagann, I thought the mecha looked ridiculous and I completely underestimated it until of course after watching the 1st episode. The story and the action in the anime just goes so well together, often you will come across anime with good action with an unfitting story line, but this, this is good. You have awesome action, some comedy to relieve the intensity of the drama and a pinch of romance. The secret to a successful anime, in my opinion, is how you can balance out action, drama, comedy and romance along the storyline, and gurren lagann did just that. So more on the characters, I will just mention the few main characters to avoid excessive exposure of any spoilers. Alright, so you have simon, kamina and yoko. Simon is a typical low self esteem kid but can be surprisingly resilient and his enthusiasm just separates him from his wimpy self, completely, that is when you will like him, his confidence is usually driven by kamina who holds as the character you find hard to hate because he is awesome. Kamina is the eccentric and too big of a optimist type of guy, and that is fine, perfect actually, together with simon you will acknowledge and learn to accept the differences and the similarities along the way and then you will understand why they both have such good chemistry with each other. And now yoko, one of the primary female protagonist in the story, a girl that is kick ass, kind, and very well composed when face to face with serious situations. She will be depicted as the love interest of both simon and kamina in the beginning but there is more to it and I will just leave it at that. Please note, these are very brief and obvious depiction of the 3 characters mentioned, you will get the impression from the very beginning, just want to give an rough idea on what sort of characters you will be expecting from the anime, perhaps it is too vague from my description, the point is watch the anime and you will find a barrage of interesting characters. Again I would like to emphasize on the hype up action you will get from this anime, it is wonderful, if you are the sort of person who pays attention to tiny details during action sequences you won't be disappointed. The mechas may not be the prettiest, but it suits the gurren lagann theme and during the action sequences you will be impressed, nothing less. gurren lagann also feature a pretty decent soundtrack, and the sound effects are properly done. Overall this is definitely a high grade anime, its an anime with sufficient budget injected into it and the result is evident. Finally, do not judge this anime before you watch it, I did, and I hated myself for that because I simply love gurren lagann. \n        "},

To clarify this is the anime where there are universe sized robots throwing planet's at each other, the one liners are difficult to comprehend yet extremely awesome, the mention of kamina's name can turn the most \"dedicated spiral warrior\" into a burst of tears, the humans are represented by spirals,the first bad guys are animals,the second bad guys explode into exploding squares. The kind of anime that is.........SO CRAZY AWESOME YOUR BRAIN CAN'T EVEN COMPREHEND IT. It makes you want to wear\n          \n        triangle shades and spew crazy liners for the rest of your life. I can't exaggerate how good it is so go and watch it.\n        "},

It no only tells the tale of a boy's journey filled with tragedies and despair and how he overcomes them but the subtle message of human's ability to overcome challenges and grow stronger.\nI loved the character development that is included for not only Simon but also for\nTeam Dai-Gurren. It gives a strong message but this anime should not be taken too seriously and should simply be enjoyed. The first couple episodes don't really give a true feeling about what's to come but i highly recommend you keep watching all of it. Gurren Lagann is simply an\n          \n        incredible anime filled with epicness and should be a must watch for anime lovers everywhere.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    First thoughts going into Gurren Lagann, was that it was just never going to fill the gap that Full Metal Alchemist left in me. This anime left me stunned. The Comedy is so hilarious because of how attached you become to the characters. The romance, is just perfect. You start rooting for characters for who gets who. Best of all the series leaves you completely satisfied! Wonderful combat. This series is great and i recommend it to anyone, average anime watcher, or diehard otakus!\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    This show by far has manly written all over it i mean if you like giant mecha robots with exploding volcanoes in the background for no apparent reason then this would be the show. One thing this show does great is when your feeling down and kinda depressed it picks you back up on your feet and makes you feel like you can do anything. The story could have been more in depth and maybe drawn out the fight scenes more but overall this is a great show and has some pretty funny parts in it. This show also has a good amount of \n          \n        fanservice to it. The soundtrack is another thing that makes this show awesome it has the perfect beat for the fight scenes and makes them feel like nothing can stop them. Overall it is a great show and i highly recommend it \n        "},

Tengen Toppa Gurrenn Lagan, like a rollercoaster where I never know where I am gonna go. \nStory\nThe story of the rise of the humans, the spiral race, Lugann is a story that is very deep, you're always wondering, is this the last enemy or not? This drives the plot forwards at an immense speed, giving you emotions that skip from amazing to utter sadness. A masterpiece in way of using your feelings against\n          \n        you, by sometimes smashing you into a wall, like the death of a certain big lead. Or maybe your screaming with thrill, at Gigabreaker. Story is a worthy 10. \nArt\nThis show came out in 2007 and still looks absolutely beautiful and intense, has some of the best explosion scenes ever made. The series also sometimes is a little artistic and strays away from it's main artform. Just a beautiful, touching use of diversity among the plot characters and leads, makes this an artwork. Art is a cultured 10. \nSound\nExplosions. Explosions. EXPLOSIONS. This beauty of a classic, just keeps pumpng those sweet sounds into your ears, making the series psyche you up more and more, until your shouting out: WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I AM?\nCharacters\nI will not go deeply in on my special depiction of the characters themselves, since to me that's like cursing in church, we all have our way of picturing Simon, Kamina, Yoko and everyone else. So better that just stay that way. \nThe characters rise from zero to hero, is to me, what makes this series. The characters have really awesome personalities, that you bond with, as if they were your own friends, and it hurt's to see them go. I feel that's all that's needed to justify a well polished character 10. \nEnjoyment.\nThis is the easiest to answer. Just an utter rollercoaster ride of feelings. It just speeds up and never stops making you go berzerk with screams. 27 episodes, gone before you know it. \nOverall. \n10/10\nThis is a series that has elevated my bar of anime. Cause TTGL just made me a believer.\n        "},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="                          \n    Story)\nThe story is a definite week point to the series since it is completely basic with out much detail put into it beyond fighting for human survival. The story focuses on the rebellion during the first half with little complexity but picks up more in the 2nd half. The entire idea of \"Spiral Power\" is completely basic on its own. The series does not really try to be complex though and prefers to be simple and extremely over the top all the time which is easy to do in the mecha genre. \nArt)\nThe design of many characters is not too much to talk about as\n          \n        Gainax studios tried to do one of the more unique styles they use in their series such as FLCL and Panty And Stocking With Garterbelt. The designs are fine and a good example would be the unique look of the mecha's called Gunmen who do not look like anything else. Also, the design of Yoko has had her regarded as one of the sexiest femals in anime today.\nSound)\nThe series does have very good sound as it uses an opening theme that is highly regarded as a pump up type song. However, the true greatness of the music is the use of the back round music which sum up characters really well. The themes of the characters Kamina and Viral are particularly good as Viral's theme is a pure adrenaline rush while Kamina's applies rap and rock along with the classic \"fight the power\" line. The music was good enough for completely music side story videos to made of the series after its completion.\nCharacters)\nThe most notable character of the series is Kamina who is one of the most popular characters of all time. Kamina is a very simple character for the most part but is very brave, brazen, entertaining and has the innate ability to inspire all that come in contact with him to drive to new heights and go far beyond there own limits. Another interesting character is the smaller character of Leeron who is voiced by Steve Blum in 1 of his more unique voices as 1 of the incredibly few homosexual characters in anime outside of yoai. Beyond that there is the character of Rossiu who begins as a simple boy but evolves into a very smart character who must try to make difficult decisions and is gone between hated and loved. The main problems with the characters is the main character himself Simon. Simon begins as a character with absolutely no guts at all even for the situations he's in and is easily dislikable. During the 2nd half of the series he improves but only to become a rip off of the more successful Kamina character.\n        "},
