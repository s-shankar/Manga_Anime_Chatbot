    Simply put, Ashita no Joe is nothing short of a timeless masterpiece of a manga. This really is likely to be one of the greatest manga creations that has ever been created as well as one of the greatest that will ever be created. In every single medium, whether it be in literature, film or anything else for that matter, there are a select few creations that manage to transcend the media in and off itself and become something truly epic, truly beautiful and truly classic. Ashita no Joe manages to pull of this staggering feat. It manages to go far beyond being just another\
          \
        inspirational story about one scrappy young lad's rise to the top of his particular sport. Ashita no Joe is a grand story about the entire life of it's main character, poignantly detailing all of the excruciating pain and suffering, expressing every thought and every action with moving and genuinely emotional realism. It is for this reason that anyone with even a modicum of admiration to the thing that we call manga owes it to themselves to check out this series at one point or another.\
It wouldn't exactly be wrong to say that the story of Ashita no Joe starts out in a fairly cliche way. The protagonist of this sports manga starts life as some no name punk who wanders around the streets as he has no place to belong but then that all changes when he comes across Danpei Tange who is a failed boxing coach turned drunkard who spots Joe's innate boxing talent and proclaims that with his training Joe's fists will someday conquer the boxing world. While this may sound similar to things you may have seen in other series it must be remembered that Ashita no Joe is one of the pioneers for the genre and that most of those other series are actually just inspired in one way or another by this series.\
This being a sporting based series the plot has that tendency to progress in a very predictable manner. There's a fight announced, a rivalry develops, the two rivals finally square of in the ring and after the fight ends the cycle begins once more, but I would just like to say that the plot in the series is really anything but conventional. There are many unexpected plot twists and I can guarantee that certain events in this story will simply leave your mouth agape and you'll find yourself nearly paralyzed by the shock of what you've just read, yes really, things really are that intense in this manga.\
Unlike many other manga series that come under the category of sports, Ashita no Joe is not exactly a cheerful or uplifting series. At points it's very brooding, the atmosphere is dark and serious and often sombre and melancholic. This series takes itself seriously and the story of Ashita no Joe is a very serious one. The heavy tone of this series separates it from others and is very important in getting across the importance of the story and the severity of life as a boxer as well as life in general.\
While structurally speaking the story of Ashita no Joe may be described as being simplistic the delivery of said story is terrific, the plot is rock solid, the interactions between characters is deep, insightful and meaningful and the progression of the story is without a single flaw. But what I really think sets Ashita no Joe apart from other similar series is how the writer's message transcends the sport of boxing entirely. This is a story about one man's life and his struggles and this is what makes the core of the story and it's the messages that can be found within that makes this story nothing short of masterful.\
Moving on to the thing that connects everything and brings the story to life for the readers; the characters. The characters in Ashita no Joe are spectacular to say the least. Let's begin with the main character, the wild brawler Joe Yabuki. Joe starts life as little more than a piece of human garbage drifting through the slums of Tokyo. Nothing but a wretched orphan that cares for nothing but himself, a prankster that gets his kicks from making the lives of those around him a misery, a rebel that goes against everything that modern society stands for. A directionless punk with no prospects, Joe would have simply wasted away if it wasn't for the interference of the stubborn Tange who would do literally anything within his power to turn Joe into a boxer. Joe's life as a street punk eventually comes to an end when his actions finally catch up to him and he's thrown into juvie. Within the confined space Joe's  only salvation was the boxing training he received from Tange that kept him going.\
Joe's passion for boxing was then finally ignited once and for all once he met his greatest rival, Rikiishi. Riikishi, while also spending time in the correctional facility was the complete opposite of Joe. He was a fine upstanding man that was destined to become a great boxer. And well it's at this point that you could say the story really starts. From this point Joe Yabuki, the wild beast that defies the very logic of the world of boxing begins to charge forward recklessly, never letting anyone interfere, never letting anyone stand in his way, never once compromising, never going against his principles as a man, even if it would lead to his own destruction, Joe lashes out against his opponent who stands on the other side of the ring.\
There are many characters in this series that I'd like to talk about in depth but I feel as though I shouldn't because I feel like I'd be spoiling things for those who've yet to read the series, so I'm just going to tell you flat, the cast of characters in this series are magnificent and are one of the many, many things that make the series so great.\
Now, I suppose many people who are thinking about reading this are probably being put off because it's too old and the artwork may not be up to the standard of more modern series. But frankly speaking the artwork is great. Granted the designs of the characters are outdated but the actual level of expression in the faces surpasses many modern series and also the level of detail put into the background goes far beyond most anything you see these days. Also the fight scenes are all brilliant to read. While initially the artwork may be a tad polarizing, all you need to do is get accustomed to it, so just give it a chance.\
The enjoyment factor in this series is a little difficult to sum up. This story is very heavy and it doesn't hold any punches. At times it is very emotive and at times you'll just feel bad and depressed once you finished a volume but that is really the strongest point of the series. It never set out to be a happy story in the first place. It's an emotive story that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster ride. And it's exactly because of the nature of this story that it is just so much more impactful than damn near anything I've ever read.\
So if you are still wondering whether or not you should read Ashita no Joe then let me just say yes definitely. I mean don't even finish this review, just go read it right now. If you're worried about not having enough knowledge about boxing then that really isn't a problem. Personally I only watch boxing a couple of times a year. I'm definitely no expert and yet I had no difficulty with this series.\

    The intense aura of a wild groan overwhelmed the whole hall, as the two gladiators standed between each other in unsteady gaze. The coach pushed your back, as the 10th round got started, by the decisive ring of the bell, crucial for recognizing the winner during the next 3 minutes. This local hall never felt such big applaud, yet couldn’t predict, that someday it would hold a world title match for their local hero. You can’t recognize anything from these mutters. As a matter of fact, you can not feel anything anyway. There is no fear, no strategy, no meaningless thoughts. Just pure descent into\

        madness, as the only feeling you can name for a while, the only thing that matters in this world is – your burning flame, once replenished never turned down, once your heart’s volcano errupted with it’s magma, it never stops exploding until it elevate your will, right with your flaming gloves into the Pompeii of your rival. And at the end the only thing that remains, is pure white ashes… \

Ashita no Joe is a work such underrated and unpopular, despite of it’s uproar back in it’s days, when it was published in late 60’s - it’s utmost sad, no one recognizes it anymore. I could have never stumble onto this if not for mere coincidence of noticing it on this site. This work is like an old man, ready to tell a quaint story from his days, yet there is no one to listen to him, as everyone are concerned with things more important or more interesting to take care about. It’s a work that – for me, as a boxing fan – replenished my love for the sport once more. A slow descent into the most obscure corners of Tokyo’s slums, where people trying their best to survive with their family can not think of anything else, as utter desperation and injustice at the world surrounding them. We did not want the war, why do we have to endure it’s consequences? Yet among them are people, who did not lose their spirit, they are ready to defy their fate and challenge the world, giving everything they can, to put up a fight and strive for more than just surviving – for Tomorrow. \
\
Joe is a short-tempered, rude  and defiant teenager. Ready to solve every problem with fists, he does not feel any empathy nor humility to anyone. Full of egoism and spite, not think about anything nor anyone, than just his own survival in this messed up world, no matter if it’s by theft, crime or at cost of someone’s own safety. What remains true to Joe is – there is no one for him. Fleeing from orphan, in which he grew since he could remember, he never had a chance to feel love nor friendship. During his lone wandering through the slums of Tokyo, being a frivolous boy, he engaged into a fight again. What remained more shocking to people watching was, that Joe could handle everyone at himself, despite of being enormously outnumbered. Danpei used to be a boxer himself. However, after the loss of his left eye, he was forced to give up on his own boxing career, aiming to become a coach instead. But due to his violent, strict, passionate and even desperate approach in training, his proteges couldn't take it and abandoned him for better gyms. as he became jobless and eventually a homeless alcoholic. A cathartic moment, bombastic realization of Danpei Tange’s  problem was finnaly understood by him, when he saw that boy fighting, as he could see with his very own eyes him standing on the top of the boxing world. In order to give Joe a training placement, Danpei tries to build up a low-standard boxing gym, for which he takes up a job in the mine, where he works horrendously long shifts – for Tomorrow. Despite of Danpei’s dedication to his plan, he could not hope for convincing Joe ,  he does not feel the need of listening to some crazy grump, nor some stupid-ass sport – as he does not listen to anyone in this world, which tries to preach him. Joe, due to his shameful conditions and constant crimes he commites, Joe goes to a juvenile prison miles away from Tokyo, where he meets Rikishi Toru – a boxer prodigy, who as the first one in Joe’s life could outclass him in his violent way of solving problems. Being at the verge of desperation, due to his lose, there is a tiny fire released in his heart, an uncontrolled passion of rivalry, which forces him to face Rikishi again, hence why he spents all nights in juvenile prison hitting his filthy mattress, according to Danpei’s training tips sent by letters to him. Where the boxing tournament is organised in the middle of juvenile prison, every uncontrolled delinquent faces a big change, a pure passion which can only be embraced by fists. \
\
Ashita no Joe is not just a story another inspirational story, following the same trope from zero to hero, rising to the top of his particular sport. It’s a story about the whole lifetime of it’s character, an as introverted, lonely and unstable human garbage, who cares for nothing but himself, that makes the lives of others a misery, that goes against every modern civilization rule, yet we see how he changes to a person, who is not good at treating women, who does not try to understand him, yet how he grows to appreciate his new friends and rivals. gaining empathy, learning how to check his temper and how to morally define the world around him. We observe his every thought and move, every expression of his suffering and his solitude and as the story progresses his pride, determination and uncompromise. It’s at no means lightheartening nor cheerful in it’s delivery. It’s a heavy collapse into the harsh reality of a boxer, where nothing is predictable and no one is truly safe, between the four corners. Mililiters of sweat, fear, anger, pride and the blood on gloves. Ashita no Joe is never going to lie about the harsh reality, nor going flashy about the confrontations of them and does not hold punches for a reader naïve enough to think of it as a game. People in this world can lose their health or lives, as what they can receive is far more meaningful, as Joe’s only salvation in his life was passion he gained by training boxing. Later on, the story gets extremely grim and does not hold any shock factor nor depressing motives, as what only remains in the end is white ashes…\
\
As how Ashita no Joe’s ending remains one of the most iconic moments in the anime history, I won’t hesitate of spoiling it. During the literature’s history, certain works or genres are often defined to their specific times, representing it’s values, motives and bright impact on the history of art, such as timeless Shakespearean tragedies, romantic poems or moving war diaries. Next to them, there are timeless pieces as Ashita no Joe to it’s nation’s history, while could be described as a sport series or a story about one man's life and his struggles, the writer’s message throughoutly transcendents the world of boxing and only the life of the protagonist - even the work itself, placing itself as one of the biggest cultural impacts manga has ever recorder, directly inspiring many boxing stories, as more famous Rocky Balboa and being the target of countless refferences in the anime medium. During the ending of the first season of anime adaptation airing in 1970, there was a special funeral for Joe’s rival – Rikishi, where about 700 people packed the streets dressed as Rikishi in his training suit. I could never feel so much emotions for a fictional character as much as I did for Joe. I loved Joe, i saw him grow from a snotty 15 year old to going toe to toe with the world's best boxer. When he finally finished the match and sat down on the chair and died, you could see he was happy... This scene is what made cry a lot of men throughout the 40 years from it’s publishing up to now and  this work is what made me love this sport once again. \"Ashita\" in Japanese means \"Tomorrow\", when bringing out the whole title could be free-translated to \"Tomorrow’s Joe\", as Joe represents the struggle of the lower class of Japan, during it’s economic transformations, where in spite of hopelessness and vain ordinary people faced, there were people like Joe, who shined a light, giving hope and doing impossible, a story not only about boxing and Joe, but about people, who did not lose the sight of what remains true to them, aiming higher and putting up a fight with all their might… for Tomorrow!",

    There are so many manga easily available that as a reader it is hard to decide which one to read. Many are just good, some are very good and sometimes we start reading something that we don't want to finish. Rarely we come across a manga that transcends time and brings joy and tears to the reader. Such a manga can be called a Masterpiece. Ashita no Joe is one such manga.\
This is the story of a boy who became a great boxer. If I write like this I won't be able to convey my feelings and anyways the summary has been provided. Many a\
          \
        times summaries can be deceiving and reviews too. \
What I can tell you for sure is that there is lots of action and drama in this story. The story is gripping from the first page to the last and keeps the reader spellbound. The characters are real and relatable. You fall in love with them.  \
The art is beautiful. The expressions are conveyed clearly and the story really flows from page to page. That is to say the direction is extraordinary. Subtle marks on the page give meaning to it and this happens often in this manga. Some may say that the style is old, but all I care for is value. If its good I'll like it no mater what time it was drawn in.\
As for enjoyment this manga is the pinnacle of enjoyment. I can not ask for more.\
So, in a nutshell what I want to say is that:\
1 This is a Masterpiece.\
2 This is a must-read(especially if you like drama, sports and action.)\
You can not go wrong by reading this manga. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",

    Most people haven't read this, which is a shame, because its simply amazing. Its impact and influence on manga is so incredibly massive, that the number of anime and manga that reference it or pay homage to it cannot be counted. That being said, it is referenced and paid homage to so many times that many people will already know the ending despite having never read it. For example, the ending of ashita no joe is a recurring theme and symbolism throughout Bakuman, but I wont say the ending because I dont wanna spoil. \
STORY\
The story was great, following Joe Yabuki taking up boxing in\
          \
        the late 60s in Japan. My one problem with the story is that it took a while to get to any actual boxing, but there is a good reason for it, and it helps the story and characters develop.\
CHARACTERS\
There are quite a few characters in the series that have a serious amount of development. whether its Joe, and all of his rudeness and depth, Danpei, and his passion and nostalgia, and so on. The characters are great. The one problem I have is the amount of misogynous . The reason its there is kind of unfortunate, with the author being a well known misogynist.\
ART\
this is to be expected. Mangas in the 60s and early 70s all had very similar artstyle to each other, without many variations. I was never a big fan of it.\
ENJOYMENT\
I loved it\
In conclusion, this series is fantastic. it has some shortcomings, yes, but it has aged well and is a fantastic read\

    Before I begin my review, I want to say that I am not the most serious critic. I only state my opinions in my reviews, and I don't shove false facts down peoples throats saying the show is bad. With that out of the way, let me start the review.\
\
Woah. This series is... something. This is really something. Ashtia no Joe filled my expectations to the max, not even that. Probably past the max. Ashita no Joe  will probably make me read more manga series, to find a manga series as great as it. Hajime no Ippo is probably the new era's Ashita no\
          \
        Joe, but in all seriousness, Ashita no Joe is still the greater.\
I mean, Hajime no Ippo is a great anime/manga series, don't get me wrong, but I don't think that Hajime no Ippo will pass Ashita no Joe in terms of story. Let's do a comparison for a bit, Hajime no Ippo's story is about a boy who got bullied a lot, while Ashita no Joe's story was about a guy who ENJOYED fighting a lot. So, there's a big difference there. The greatest thing about Ashita no Joe was Joe's character development, but, let's keep that until later.\
Story: 10/10\
As mentioning before, Ashita no Joe's story is truly fascinating. One of the most greatest stories I've ever come across, even if it's simple; a man enjoys to fight. But, that's not it. The story develops a lot, and Yabuki accidentally kills one of his opponents (might be a spoiler, but I didn't mention his name) and he can no longer fight for a while until he comes across a gangster guy who encourages him to continue to box. The story develops even more as Joe fights even stronger people, and works his way up to fight the champion of the world, Jose Mendoza. That begins to be Joe's only goal, to fight Jose Mendoza.\
Art: 7/10\
Since this was made in the late 60s, it actually doesn't have that bad of art style. The art style looks like something that would be made in late 90s, early 2000s. The art style actually fits the manga and I really like the type of art style. It's awesome, especially for a 60s manga.\
Character: 9/10\
Let me say this; Joe Yabuki has the best character development, but I love almost everyone in the show. Including the people from the Prison arc (what I'm calling it), Aoyama... and... uh, forgot the others names. Nishi was a big part of the series until Volume 8, where he started to stop boxing, and wasn't a big thing in it anymore. Shiraki Yoko is probably my favorite female character of all time; Reason; no idea, she's just fascinating in all ways. Her character doesn't develop the best, but it's pretty decent.\
Overall: 10/10\
Ashita no Joe is a masterpiece of the past. A true gem that needs to be recognized by more. People should not avoid this manga just because of it's age, in fact, that is the reason why they should read it. Ashita no Joe is a true gem of the past, and I recommend that anyone with a passion for boxing, or not, should read it.\

    Ashita no Joe/Tomorrow's Joe is without a doubt one of the greatest and most powerful manga ever made, and its ending alone sets it among the most amazing stories there is...but it is old, and time has hurt it a bit.\
Story: 8 : Some punk ass teenager who packs a serious punch and has a severe inferiority complex meets an old drunken and retired boxer who decides to teach him how to make a living through his craft.\
This setup might seem like the buildup to a powerful relationship between future student and master, but it really, really isn't.\
One of the first things Joe's future trainer,\
          \
        Tange Danpei, has to do to teach his wayward punk of a student is get him sent to juvenile detention...\
Joe's history before and during the vast majority of this manga is about fighting, scamming, and trying to pick more fights with pretty much everyone he finds. So when he's offered to be taught boxing to make a living, his only answer's a middle finger and the only way to tame the beast is to send him to juvie, where he meets an actual boxer who will really kick joe's ass and open his mind on boxing a little.\
Only then does he accept Tange's education in boxing, and even then, only so very little of it...\
Art: 4 : Harsh note I suppose, but it's...well it's really old and art in manga just has evolved so much past this that it kinda stings my eyes to see some things. The faces may be very expressive and the technical aspect of the fights may be mostly good (as in you understand what's going on on the ring), but I still can't find it in me to call this good-looking at any point. Usually when beauty's lacking I look for style, but even then, apart from the two main characters' very expressive faces, most people look like a ton of other people in other manga.\
Character: 7 : Let me expand on the \"Joe accepts so very little of Tange's education\" statement.\
Joe is, and that's not really baffling for such an old manga but it's certainly something you wouldn't see today, a complete shithead. And I insist on that. He's not your typical cocky shounen hero or someone who has \"problems\" of some sort.\
He's just a shithead. All he cares to do is beat people, scam people, or spit at people's faces, and ignore the kindnesses done to him. The fact that he's an unabated moron, and a teenage one at that, certainly also doesn't help. \
Many, many times throughout this manga, Tange will attempt to push Joe to do something smart, and Joe will angrily tell him to shut up. And when I say many times, I mean about 5 times per tome at the very least.\
Worse is that the dynamic that would exist in later manga where the estranged but like-minded master and student slowly open to one another is also completely absent. Tange does pretty much everything he can to get Joe out of the gutter he loves to drown himself in, and all he gets as thanks is disrespect and bratty selfishness.\
This is something that needs to be understood: this is not a nice manga. It's not hardcore gore although the blood is plentiful in fights, but more than anything it's not meant to be nice. Characters don't grow to like each other. Assholes stay assholes. This isn't a tale meant to show how to become a responsible and gentle adult. It's a tale for the sake of the tale.\
Or rather, for the sake of the flame.\
None of the characters in Ashita no Joe ever change or grow much. They simply each have a purpose and serve it to their ends. Joe wants to prove to himself that he's his own boss and nobody ever orders him. Or even offers anything to him. Tange wants to make Joe a great boxer despite Joe's bratty attitude. Yoko Shiraki wants to make Rikishi and Joe great boxers. Rikishi wants to reach the boxing heights.\
The last paragraph was the entire plot, character design, and purpose for everything in Ashita no Joe.\
It's hard to explain since modern manga seldom ever have that principle anymore, but this truly isn't trying to tell you anything. It's not about a good or a bad story. It has no philosophical message or deep immersion into complex concepts like you could find in modern shounen or seinen.\
It's just...just a punk that becomes a boxer and keeps acting like a punk. Just a drunken old fool who wants to coach a great boxer and keeps drinking.\
Just a few people trying their hardest to do what they want to do in life, no matter the cost.\
Enjoyment: 10: why 10, I wonder as I write this. It's not a 10. It's not even close. I didn't enjoy this nearly as much as many other things. \
But I'd feel like it's a misnote if it's anything but a 10.\
Beyond the issues I've cited, I could add on Ashita no Joe's problem pile that it starts off awfully slow and that you spend way too many tomes not starting the story of a boxer who's stuck on the streets or in prison. Joe's personality(in case I wasn't blatant enough about it) is obnoxious and it never lets up for almost 20 tomes. \
Ashita no Joe may not have any of the qualities of more modern manga, but if one word defines its main appeal, it's no doubt \"desire\". \
The extreme boredom at the start took nothing out of the powerful desire you feel from everything in this manga.\
Joe's story, beyond being a punk, is about giving absolutely everything he has to win. No matter what. Tange, in a much wiser way, is also the same. It's what I mean when I say \"desire\" defines this. Nothing in this manga seems to matter, not the characters yelling at each other all the time, not Joe being a complete dick, not the side characters, not the girl, not even the opponent. All that matters is that Joe and Tange will do anything, absolutely anything, to reach their goal.\
Some people will call Ashita no Joe timeless, and I can see why, although to me it's strongly implanted in the 1970's Japan and postwar Japan in spirit. It's timeless because it's not about a character, setting, or even its sport. Boxing could easily have been replaced with another bloody sport. It's the flame, the unbendable desire to conquer everything, that makes this manga so good. It's not just about winning the matches or Joe's arrogance and violence, it's about consistently doing everything, from the ridiculous to the insane to the hateful, to conquer, to win, to prove to yourself and others that you can do it. The driving force behind both the storytelling and the general structure is this tremendous flame, this burning ship that pays no heed to the storms and sails away carrying its flame, not caring if it sinks. It's when Joe falls again and again and gets back up again and again. It's when Tange yells and yells and gets yelled at and doesn't kick Joe out. It's when through all the fights, the fears, the traumas, the self-hate, the rivalries, the nightmares, they still push through like a train off its tracks speeding with a thunderous noise through the night.\
If ever there was a manga where everyone gave their all, apart from Berserk's Guts, it's Ashita no Joe.\
Conclusion: 9: hard to truly judge with numbers a manga this flawed. I picked it and sort of forced myself to read through the long, long and pointless pages of juvie. I hated many parts of it and wished Joe would get decked one good time or two and perhaps learn to think of something else than himself and his complex. I was awed with how many stories ended for many boxers. I was entranced by the manga's end. I looked at the fights like every fight was the final one. And while many, many mangas have been far more fun, or emotionally involving, or more interesting, none have reached the extremism, the investment, the burning need to give everything away for victory, than Ashita no Joe. Its main purpose may make it a difficult read, but it is a masterpiece in what \"giving it all\" means. \

    Simply put this manga is amazing and aside from a few pretty inconsequential problems I had with it this is gonna be nothing but praise.\
At the core Ashita no Joe is a character driven drama about Joe himself, people around him and they they go through their difficult lives. As such I don't you can't talk about story without talking about characters and you can't talk much about characters without spoiling manga. \
What I can say though is that impressive how much nuance the main cast has. Aside from some supporting characters that don't play a large part in the story everyone has a very\
          \
        believable multifaceted personality and over the course of their arc you learn about who they are, how they act and how they change as well as what causes it. It's a long, difficult and a very tragic story in a way that's not immediately obvious or rather it's never thrown in your face. It's practically overwhelming how much there is to say about Joe's and his passion to fight until he burns up his youth, Tange who relives his former glory by guiding Joe to success while trying to contain his self-destructive habits, Yoko's subtle attempts to straight out Joe's character or special bonds shared between Joe and most of his opponents. The manga is brimming with countless interesting and intricate character moments. Because of this it can be slow at times which is one of the minor problems I had when reading it but what it gives you in return is so satisfying that it's hard to complain about.\
It's probably a disservice to talk so little about this aspect of Ashita no Joe for how strong and prevalent it is but I feel like going into more detail would just turn into plot recap or character analysis. \
As far as complaints go I have only one that in any way affected my enjoyment which is Harimau, from now on it's gonna be spoilers so if you haven't read the manga skip this paragraph. I know why Harimau was part of the story, I know his purpose and as far as that goes he served it well but reading 19th volume was hard at times just because of how ridiculous he is. Most of the manga is fairly down the earth, there's little exaggeration when it comes to abilities of the boxers and no any real melodrama but then comes along a tribal boxer found in the jungles who was raised by animals and could kill anything in the jungles by the age of 12. Some time later by random chance he's discovered by an english explorer and taught how to box however it's later revealed his boxing is lackluster and he only wins thanks to being wild, strong and tough. This could've been more or less fine if he was just kind of dumb but strong and aggressive slugger that forces Joe to revert to his old self but the guy is literally acting like an animal which Joe notes in one of the panels. Not only his character is fucking absurd his fighting style is not any better. The man jumps from rope to rope like a kangaroo delivering strong punches and his other signature attacks are jumping above someone's head and hitting them midair or doing a fucking double backflip while uppercutting his opponent each spin. It's dumb and I could've bring myself to like any of that.\
That concludes the story part. What remains is art and I loved that too. I'm usually not too keen on most very old manga/anime because of seemingly common overall unimpressive simplicity and very cartoonish designs which can ruin any scene with serious tone, but I feel like AnJ hits the sweet spot. There's plenty of detail in backgrounds, occasional spreads as well as bodies and faces while still mostly cartoonish are not comically exaggerated save for a few examples and can covey a large array of emotion, sometimes even fairly subtle ones.\
Overall it's a great manga that's very much worth a read, especially if you're into having well written characters.\

He is fond of sake, being overly cheerful when drunk which contrasts with his strict everyday self. He is also very polite when talking to people that hold higher ranks than himself, something that annoys Joe, who doesn't care for such things. \
 Prior to meeting Joe, it is stated that Danpei used to be a boxer himself.\
 However, after the loss of one of his eyes, we learn that he was forced to give up on his own boxing career, aiming to become a coach instead. But due to his violent, strict, passionate and even desperate approach in training his boxers (who couldn't take it and abandoned him for better gyms) he became jobless and eventually a homeless alcoholic.\
 \
 After meeting Joe and claiming that he has massive potential for the sport, he gives up on drinking due to the former's aversion to alcoholism (only drinking on special occasions) and vows to train him to be Japan's or even the world's best boxer, with the hope of a better tomorrow for the both of them.\

 Not long after birth he found himself in many orphanages and facilities. However, he quickly grew tired of the boring life and frequently escaped, eventually finding his way to the Doya Town the story takes place in.\
 \
 Joe is rude and quick to fight, but he can also be very frivolous at times. Because of his rough upbringing he is a delinquent who likes his solitude, but he later grows to appreciate his new friends and rivals. He is not very good at understanding women, and essentially only treats them nice out of obligation.\
 \
 As a result of Rikiishi's death he temporarily suffers and cannot hit people in the temple, but he later overcomes this.\
 He is a bantamweight and his specialties include the cross counter and the No Guard stance. He has extraordinary punching strength, fortitude, and fighting spirit, often standing up after taking killer blows and has been known to counter cross-counters (a double-cross), possessing a raw, natural talent for the sport. He has even countered double crosses with a triple-cross, implying he has high-level technical abilities. Following his fight with Rikiishi, he begins to better develop his guarding.\
