In the 22nd century, Japan enforces the Sibyl System, an objective means of determining the threat level of each citizen by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their Psycho-Pass. Inspectors uphold the law by subjugating, often with lethal force, anyone harboring the slightest ill-will; alongside them are Enforcers, jaded Inspectors that have become latent criminals, granted relative freedom in exchange for carrying out the Inspectors' dirty work. Into this world steps Akane Tsunemori, a young woman with an honest desire to uphold justice. However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns that the Sibyl System's judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.

Likewise, I also feel sorry for anybody who didn’t, because Urobuchi Gen ripped their hearts out.\nThe series is set in the near future in which it is possible to instantaneously quantify a person’s state of mind, personality, and probability of committing a crime, all recorded on an individual’s “Psycho-Pass”. When their “Crime Coefficient” index becomes too high, they are pursued and apprehended by police officers known as Inspectors, and their ‘hunting dogs’ the Enforcers; in this way, order is maintained. Unit One of the Public Safety\n          \n        Bureau’s division of criminal investigation, navigate the system to uphold justice in their seemingly Utopian society.\nBefore anything else, let’s address some reasons the show received heavy criticism early on, and was subsequently written off because of it.\nInspector Tsunemori Akane: As a frequenter of tumblr, I saw so many people dismiss the protagonist of the series immediately after episode 1, and to that I say shame on you. She got a lot of flack for being naive and idealistic, but that was the whole point of her character development. Even more egregious was how much hate she got because of her design, and again, shame on you. Both the director and the writer explicitly stated that “moe” would be completely omitted from Psycho-Pass; there’s a lot of back and forth between whether Akane is or isn’t moe (though the pink jellyfish comes close), but you don’t hate on a character because of their haircut. And personally, I think she’s cute.\nToo slow: I understand, the series does take it’s time in the beginning. Psycho-Pass doesn’t really reach the heart of its story until about episode 10. However, everything before this is time spent establishing the cyberpunk setting, the relationships between the characters, and setting up for an unbelievable payoff later. Every reveal in the series speaks to something that was established earlier (yes, even the HyperOats) because the writer is a master at foreshadowing and bringing his stories full circle. It is well worth wading through the cases in the beginning to reach the core of the story later.\nPsycho-Pass is a ripoff of Minority Report: a 2002 film directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Cruise based off a short story of the same name written by legendary science fiction author, Philip K. Dick. And honestly, to this I have to say… so what? Having only seen the trailer, I could just as easily say that Pacific Rim is a rip off of Evangelion, but that doesn’t say anything about its merit on any level. So even if the series is derivative (and what material isn’t these days?), the two focus on different themes and tell totally separate stories; Minority Report is a commentary on human free will and choice where Psycho-Pass is a revenge story at its core and an examination of justice, taking place in the same kind of setting.\nAnd the joke is on you, because Philip K. Dick’s work is actually mentioned in the series. It’s obvious, to the point of near literary pretentiousness, how the series pays homage to the themes and philosophies found in great written works. I can see how consistently name dropping George Orwell or Jonathan Swift might be annoying, but as a total classic literature nerd, it made me excited to pick up what they were alluding to in the books I have read, and inspired to hunt down the rest so I could understand the series even better (hard copies— because e-books lack character). Besides, an image of Heart of Darkness conveys just as much as a long-winded discourse about the descent into darkness and the true nature of humanity would. It isn’t always subtle, but it is challenging and elevates the show to more than just another crime thriller anime.\nBefore I continue lauding it, let me clarify: Psycho-Pass is bloody, violent, and disturbing, and not for the weak-hearted. This anime has cruel scenes, both physically and mentally, and the director joked that he wanted the kids in the audience to sustain trauma for life after watching. O_O But that is not why your heart will be ripped out.\nYour heart will be ripped out because Urobuchi Gen helmed this.\nUrobuchi-san (Fate/Zero & Puella Magi Madoka Magica) is known for writing dark, nihilistic themes and tragic plot twists into his stories, earning him the affectionate nickname “The Uro-BUTCHER”. Back when I wrote my original Madoka review, I had no idea who this man was or what he would do to my emotions. Lobotomizing yourself with a spoon would be less painful. If only I had known then…\nThe reason Urobuchi-san is capable of writing compelling stories is not because he’s heavy handed with the nihilism or because he shies away from current trends in the anime industry. There are two very good reasons.\n1. He knows how to write people— realistic, human characters with attributes and flaws and personal motivations and incredible development (see: Ginoza Nobuchika). The audience doesn’t suffer because tragic events happen, but because they happen to these characters, whom you have grown to know and love and sympathize with (see: Ginoza Nobuchika).\n2. He never writes standard black and white conflicts. The system in place which monitors people’s mental states for the sake of safety arguably takes way their free will, but without it the society plunges into chaos. The Enforcer seeks to bring down the main antagonist for personal revenge, not for the sake of justice; and yet if the anarchist wins, in theory, people’s wills are restored as long as they survive the crumbling of the system. As you watch his series, you might not know who you want to win, or whether they should, and it makes for deeply thought provoking entertainment. (The “Psycho-Scan” aspect of the series alone is provocative when you put it into the context of how mental health is approached in Japan.)\nThere’s a lot of commentary on human nature, the natures of societies, law and governance, good and evil. There’s tons of brain-candy to chew on here; Psycho-Pass is not a series to watch if you travel into anime to escape or like to keep your mind turned off. Although it shares similar themes and story telling elements as something like Madoka Magica, the complexity, the science fiction crime mystery genre, and integration of philosophy and literature makes it less universal in appeal, but all the more appealing for someone like me.\nKnowing Urobuchi’s previous work had me worried. Hearing that the entire staff cried over the final episode had me very worried. But even with his bloody reputation preceding him, Psycho-Pass has proved that Urobuchi-san is master storyteller capable of being twisted and incredibly emotional, as well as demonstrating diversity and restraint. His name is one I’m sure to be following from now on.\nOh, and it also looked great. And sounded great. Production I.G.’s work here is wonderful, and they’re generally a top notch studio. Production knew when to hold back, so they could really deliver where it mattered later (the dog hunting scene was very dark and difficult to see, but “The Gates of Judgement”? that three something minute fight scene was unbelievable). The backgrounds were incredibly detailed and the series has a great look, managing to be extremely colorful and yet very dark. The integration of CG was also very impressive, and I’m glad to see they pulled it off so successfully  since technology is a major motif in this 22nd century world. I might just be drawn to the style, but all of Amano Akira’s character designs look great (yes, even Akane-chan’s).\n*jumps onto the soapbox* Episode 18, “Promises Written in Water”, came out totally derpy-looking because of scheduling issues. Even the director apologized, saying that in order to get the episode out on time, it would air incomplete. This is not just an acceptable drop in animation quality like we typically see from Gainax or Gonzo, just an honest to goodness time issue. Production on the episode will be finished in time for the home media releases and it will be just as quality as the rest of the series. *hops off the soapbox*\nThe score was varied, very synthy and they played around with different types of sounds to add in, but fitting with the futuristic setting and dark tone of the anime. There are some standout pieces on the OST, I’m rather fond of the main theme and a very pretty and somber piano piece reserved for the quieter moments. Psycho-Pass is guilty of playing Bach, stealing a leaf out of Evangelion’s book, but at least the high-brow pretentiousness makes more sense here. All the OPs and EDs were similarly successful, sporting beautiful animation (and a bit of foreshadowing), not to mention that many of the songs were written for the specific characters. “abnormalize” speaks to Kogami’s character, where “Namae no nai Kaibutsu” should be listened to with Makishima in mind. Also, I don’t think the fanbase will ever get tired of “cause I feeeeeeeellll” or “your never walk alonee” and neither will I.\nIn general, I struggle watching shows week to week because I prefer marathoning my anime and when I really get into it, I am incapable of doing anything else while waiting in between episodes (should have seen me after Ep. 19, it was baad). And I haven’t done this with any other anime of 2012, so it speaks to how stellar Psycho-Pass really was when I say it was the highlight of my week, every week, until the end. I’m going to go out and buy Proust right now. What an incredible ride.\n"},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=387,  ["text"]="                          \n    I heard great things about Psycho Pass and it being compared to Death Note, I thought it would be great. But I didn't find the anime to be anything more than your run of the mill dark themed series. Before throwing off my review as a hated one, I would appreciate it if you guys just took a couple of minutes to read what I thought of Psycho Pass\n\nStory - 7/10\nThe setting of Psycho Pass is a futuristic one in modern Japan, where people who have a high and cloudy Psycho Pass are either adjudged criminals or potent criminals. The ones who have a Psycho\n          \n        Pass of above a certain rating are criminals who're judged dangerous and have no hope but the potent criminals can work as Enforcers with the police in order to catch the other criminals. \nThe reason I gave a 6 in story is because the first few episodes were pretty blatant with no real relevance to the plot. The episodes in itself aren't irrelevant, its rather the amount of episodes they wasted in doing so. But the story starts getting good around the 8 episode in the show and continues to be a good one till the 16 episode or so. Around that time, we have a confrontation between the protagonist and the antagonist. The show should have ended there with a few prior things explained before that 16-17 episode mark. The next 6-7 episodes are just stretched out and completely based on plot devices. I think I have spoiled enough for you.\nArt - 6/10\nThe art of Psycho Pass is okay; it's nothing special really. It isn't overly good for an anime released in 2012. Compared to some of the other anime of that time, the art is not up to the mark by a long way. It gets really choppy at times and makes you wonder if this is an anime released after 2010. \nSound - 5/10\nThere isn't really any memorable soundtrack in this anime. I've watched the anime just a few days ago and I can't remember even one theme of the series. At best, there may have been a couple of decent soundtrack, but that was it. If there was one thing good about the sound of Psycho Pass, it would be the voice acting which was pretty good.\nCharacters - 5/10\nThe characters except for the villain, Makishima Shougo were shallow and the character that I hated most, the female MC, Akane Sunamori was just a jackass who got a sudden personality change in the last few episodes. She got a perfect opportunity to overthrow the Sibyl System but she doesnt do anything. She gets the chance to kill the antagonist 3 times and she's just too weak to do it. It was just plot manipulation to me. People say that she got a lot of development but she didn't She had a stale, weak personality throughout the entire series and suddenly becomes all brave and decisive in the last few episodes.\nThe male lead, Shinya Kougami is a smart guy who does what he wants for most of the series except some occasions where Akane tells her not to. At all such instances, he sighs and does what she says even though he knows that the opposite should be done. He doesnt listen to anyone and somehow listens to Akane from the beginning. (He doesnt have feeling for the girl either so that's not why he listens to her).\nThe antagonist is a good character but he is a Gary Stu. He is intelligent, thin but yet somehow manages to overpower Shinya multiple times even though Shinya works out and has a really good build. He also has surprisingly great endurance, healing really quickly without any supernatural powers. But compared to others, he's the best character and you're questioned whether his actions are good or evil.\nEnjoyment - 6/10\nOverall, I enjoyed the middle episodes of Psycho Pass the most. The start was okay but the ending was just ridiculous. The middle episodes were really good though, with some exciting scenes. The first few episodes were slow, boring, mostly irrelevant to the plot and completely illogical. The same with the ending. As I mentioned a few times earlier, this show should've been around a 14 episode show. It never really needed 20+ episodes because it was dragged on too much in the end, leading to a nonsensical ending and the episodes which preceded the conclusion to the show didn't have anything to write home about either.\nOverall - 6/10\nThe show could have been really a lot better if there weren't so many plot devices involved and if they would've finished the anime around that episode 16-18 mark where both the males were brought to near death. Also, Akane really started to annoy me when her personality suddenly changed. I like character development and she didn't get any. Her character just took a huge jump in one episode from being a weak, scared officer who can't even use a real gun to shoot the enemy to a brave girl who's strong enough to make her own grave decisions. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=336,  ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    There is nothing more undefined, blurry, and vague than the line that separates \"good\" from \"bad\". What complicates the matter further is the question of \"is said action more bad/good than another?\" Why do we consider the murder of an innocent person a worse offense compared to something like a bank robbery? Is a doctor who saves hundreds of lives more \"good\" than a simple volunteer at a homeless shelter? While Psycho Pass may not be a realistic representation of today's societal state, the observation of human morals, psychological concepts, and fluctuation of emotions can all be applied to our methodology of thinking and our\n          \n        outlook on life itself. \nThe premise of the show poses an interesting scenario: what if we lived in a world where it was possible to determine the potential of a person through a simple cymatic scan, and judge/assign that person accordingly? You would be told your aptitude for certain jobs, the extent of your latent abilities, and the likelihood of mental instability and the capacity to commit crimes. This is the world that Psycho Pass is set in. The show follows the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division and the various cases that are assigned to them. Through their work solving crimes, we delve into conflicts of morality, the battle between the righteous and injustice, and the clash between different ideologies about the Sibyl System that made this whole lifestyle possible.\nThe strongest selling point of Psycho Pass is its cast of well developed and intricate characters. We have Tsunemori Akane, a new Investigator of the Criminal Investigation Division, and her beliefs are what is most commonly defined as \"righteous\". She is the representation of the ideal yet naive mindset that justice is absolute and criminals must be punished. She holds the law close to her heart, and while very young and inexperienced, she is an intelligent person and attempts to see the good in people. Through her exposure to the more sinister side of society, we observe if she is able to withstand the challenges to her beliefs and how she changes as an individual. \nHelping her solve crimes and doing most of the \"dirty work\" is one of the Enforcers under her, Kogami Shinya. As one that is familiar with the darker side of society and has accumulated a plethora of experience in dealing with criminal minds, he is calculating, intelligent, and physically adept. His outlook on justice and the nature of other people differs from Akane's, and this difference serves as a driving force for the show. While he is normally collected and logical, his emotions do cause him to act irrationally and puts him in precarious situations. His resolve and detective skills are put to the test and we are shown the lengths in which he will go through to reinforce his beliefs. \nIn addition to these two, we have Ginoza, a veteran Inspector with some very firm and rigid beliefs on criminals and potential and Masaoka, an experienced Enforcer who was a detective but was deemed a latent criminal and is a bit old fashioned. We also are introduced to Kagari, a easygoing Enforcer who was marked as a criminal at the age of five and has been an Enforcer ever since and doesn't think too highly of the Sibyl System and Yayoi, a former guitarist turned Enforcer trying to prevent others from ending up as criminals similar to how someone dear to her did. Rounding out our Unit One, we have Shion, the Bureau's analyst that aids the unit in solving crimes, and Joshu, the enigmatic Chief of the Bureau. The fact that none of these characters are insignificant or unimpactful enough to dismiss is quite a feat, but Psycho Pass gives each and every character depth and relevance to the main plot. \nA debate that has stood the test of time is the question: are humans innately good or evil? Do we strive to side by justice because it is in our nature, our personalities, our entire being, or do we do so in order to simply create the facade of appearing as a righteous person? Are our actions a culmination of self interest, in that we do everything for personal gain? Forging relationships, creating bonds; are they simply methods to reach the end goal of personal satisfaction and happiness? Psycho Pass portrays and addresses this issue through excellent storytelling, proficient pacing, and a cast of realistic characters. From watching Akane attempting to defend latent criminals and trying to give them a chance to prove their innocence, to Shinya's drive based on personal revenge and his definition of justice, Psycho Pass keeps its audience consistently alert and interested, with plot twists and shifts that are unpredictable and wholeheartedly intriguing. \nThe art is bold and catches the eye's attention. From the casual conversation scenes to the dynamic and high tension fight scenes, everything is animated with a finesse that is incredible. While some may dislike some of the characters design, that is ultimately personal preference. The sound is appropriate for a sci-fi show. The OP and EDs are upbeat and catchy and will stick with you even after the conclusion of the show. They serve to build suspense and set the mood, and everything fits into the whole picture to deliver a well coordinated show.\nPsycho Pass, I believe, can be considered a masterpiece. With thought-provoking dialogue and plot, an amount of drama and tension that is neither excessive nor underwhelming, and a group of characters that are just as complex as many of us, Psycho Pass delivers an action sci-fi show unlike one we've seen before.\n"},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=266,  ["text"]="                          \n    First of all, I'd recommend you to read another review if u want to get an overview about this series. \nSince most of this is somewhat my biased opinion about my anger and how the story felt. Its not to see as a recommendation for anyone, more like some ideas to think of. If u are still interested, u can keep on reading.\nBefore reading this you should be prepared for spoilers and bad mouthing, since thats the only way i can describe a few things. \nThe series first episodes remind me of cowboy bebops style of showing episodes. It describes a few things beforehand. After\n          \n        a few episodes the anime changes its style, from daily tasks for the police to a longer task.    The \"main\" antagonist is getting to the center of the show, Makishima. Ill describe him a bit later.\nThe series Main Character (MC) Tsunemori is a girl working for the Police in a time where a so called Computer System called Sibyl is ruling over the people.\nFine, but there is something wrong about Tsunemori. She can unconsciously control her Criminal Coefficient -->\nThe Criminal Coefficient, A Parameter on whom people get judged by with the Sibyl system. It doesnt matter if u did a crime or think about a crime, it represents your state of mind and your feelings, the Sibyl system measures that and gives out the Criminal Coefficient. UHHH, Minority Report, anyone???\nThis control of the Criminal coefficient reminds of the main antagonists characteristics, which became more and more clear ongoing in the series.\nAfter all, those people are special.\nThe main thing that pissed me off about the show was the main characters bahaviour. She keeps following the Sibyl system, that betrayed all of her ideals towards the end, protects it and keeps dreaming of ideals like the System will vanish if something changes humanity. \nAwwwwh come on, please, this is bullshit. Following the System, that is meant to judge all humans is build on murderes and criminals with this special power to ignore the criminal coefficient. Tsunemori gets to know this and is \"of course shocked on that episode with an extremely shocking reaction\"... nothing. she just accepts it towards the end. Yeah why not?\nLet the system be built on around 250 mass murderes and criminals minds because they are \"Special\". Just ignore it tsunemori \"GOOD JOB,GOOD GIRL\"... \nThe reason why? Because the system is protecting humanity and delivers them happines.\nYeah my ass. Half of the people are in a cage, a few are living life like rats running away and the last few are people, ignoring everything like a murder in this one episode where the girl gets  Hammered in her HEAD. Easyyyy\nAlso those special people robbed her of her best friend, lets ignore that the Justice System is build on people like that. What ever, want to hear my advice?\nGo down there with the EMP Grenade and shut down the cage, melt the brains, free the Human birds since living in that cage will mean hell for most of them without themselves knowing it. Killing all their emotions and living a meaningless life, decided by the System.\nThe only points the series managed to grab from me came from the Antagonist Makishima. His appearences in the series gave this anime a future. Unluckily , he was robbed of his \"Zero Requiem\".\nWhat could have been done? \nAfter the failure from the hacker guy, just end the series with a cliffhanger season. Go on with season 2 and build up an insane comeback, what else? Or you could have done it in this season with more episodes, not a weak ending with a pathetic lead to the 2nd season.\n\nMy final thoughts:\nOf course this series is not bad, its the opposite but it does not deserve his position in the 8.5~ rating. its rather Fine(6) to Good (7) after destroying the deepness in the characters and the epicness in the makishima scenes. \nLike wtf? The hacker guy and his 3 other morons could have easily dealt with that idiot and revealed this bullshit... The old lady would have killed the other ones after the vidoe was uploaded but What ever.\nI watched it, i liked the first few episoed, i had high hopes and they got crushed by the computability of the story.\nOn normal terms id go with an 8 since compared to other animes this has just more quality but nah im sticking to my biased selfish opinion and going with 5!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=126,  ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    After watching this series twice within a short amount of time (a month or so) and still enjoying it to the fullest, I felt compelled to finally write my first MAL review. \nI will not bother writing a plot summary, you can read the essentials a little further above. I will, however, try to rate the plot. Psycho Pass will sometimes be referred to as PP.\nPlot: 9.5/10:\nThe series is most of all a police-sci-fi set in near future. This sounds rather cliché put Psycho Pass manages to mix in a variety of genres in a non-confusing way. The near-future/sci-fi is at all time present, whereas\n          \n        the police-element is sometimes very prominent, making the series almost a crimi/detectives series, and at other times more in the background, the series then focusing on either characters or the way the PP world functions. Likewise is it with the action, coming more in small bumps rather than being all-time present. The series offer only a limited amount of humour as well as a discreet hint of romance, but you can find these things in the series. However, if you're searching for romantic comedy PP is not it. Drama is often quite intense, sometimes even heartbreaking, this making it easier to both relate to the characters and understand the more complicated parts of the story.\nThe plot of PP consists of smaller arcs focused around the same villain. All of these arcs are quite flawlessly done and come together in the end in an almost perfect way. PP is a series with a masterful plot (imo nearly as good and well-written as Death Note). In PP things seem to happen for a reason, not just randomly. A few times it might get boring, but generally PP has a good mixture of genres in the right amount. PP is also a series where you, when watching, will have to focus. The story is definitely complicated and does, as every other really good series, leave you thinking. I sat all the time thinking 'would I want society to be like this?'. Your definition of justice is also something you might reconsider after watching PP.\nAll in all amazing plot, one boring ep. draws down, making it 9.5/10 for me.\nArt: 9/10\nArt is something I have a really hard time rating. For the character design itself is a matter of opinion, not fact. Therefore an anime's art must mainly be rated on scenery and the flow of the animation. \nThe scenery in PP is very beautiful. Buildings, parks, light, everything is done really great. The visuals will often leave you stunned. But even if it's very good, I have seen better (but not often in a series with such a good plot as well), therefore the scenery can only get somewhere between 8 and 9 from me. \nThe animation flow, on the other hand, is quite simply outstanding. Maybe I've not seen the right animes but never before have I seen as good 3D-look-a-like animation as in PP. Square objects are animated in a way that almost make them look 3D, coming out of the screen. Also the way it's sometimes insignificant everyday objects that are animated flawlessly, is both peculiar and perfect. Honestly, I found the animation breathtaking. \nAnother thing I noted, watching PP a  second time, was the light reflection. Oh, it was beautiful. Often in the ending we see light hitting water, looking almost like a blazing sea. But it was not this that had me spellbound. It was the way the light reflected in the Characters' eyes. The light sometimes even changed he eye colour, giving the animation a very realistic touch.\nReally, PP has some dazzling art if you look at the details.\nNow on to the sound (what a huge review I'm making xD): 9.5/10\nWith openings and endings can be said the same as with character design, value is based on personal opinion, and therefore OP/END cannot be rated. I can, however, rate the lyrics and fitingness of the music, which I'll try to do.\nWhether you like the songs or not, the openings and endings can objectively be said as to fitting perfectly with the series. Especially the first OP and END which I think is the most well-fitting pair of songs I've ever seen/heard in an anime. The lyrics were probably made for this series. I mean, seriously, they're just too well-fitting. In the first op the question of society, which is also asked throughout the whole series, is brought up. In the ending we get a song most well fitting for one of the characters.The fast pace these two songs also fits the action of the series, building up even more tension. \nThe next set of songs are good as well, but take on a more quiet, romantic turn, which I do not find fitting for the series.  \nNext up is the background-music. Generally the tracks are both good and well-fitting. There's one which is a bit out of place, and this definitely draws down on my sound-score.\nLast is the voice-actor cast. Actually I don't really feel skilled enough to rate this, so I'll just say, that I was generally satisfied. I think most voice-actors delivered a great performance and the voices fit the characters. I will say, with my limited skill, that Makshimas' actor did a greeeat job. His voice was a perfect fit. \nA last remark on sound is another bonus: something rarely seen, the ending-video not being the same each time, but not only that - different parts of the song were chosen to make the most perfect fit - and also - talking in-between two parts of the ending song. What I'm trying to say; the video and song was each time composed to fit the plot flawlessly. That also means: Watch the ending EVERY time, there might be important plot in the middle of it.\nLast up is characters: 9/10:\nThe protagonist of this series is the young female inspector, Akane Tsunemori. Akane seems to be the standard cry-baby, full-of-justice, irrational, emotional, very annoying character. But I can tell you, she's not. Akane is a human, who acts very human. Who, for instance, is affected by stressed situations, and, who sometimes lets emotion cloud her judgement. Akane is bright, and has a strong believe of what is justice. She's a genuinely good person, who believes in this world, and for that, I don't think she should be punished. She is a newbie, who has to learn, and she does. The development of her character is different from what I usually see - and different from what I'd expected. She is not flawless, and yes, she's (as a character) a little cliché, but she's not stupid and her development is rather original.\nThe male hero of the story is probably Shinya Kougami, a subordinate of Akane and a latent criminal. Even if the story  focuses on Akane, the real plot unfolds around Kougami; thus making him almost more of a main character than Akane. Kougami is on first sight, our typical strong, badass, grumpy male-hero. But like Akane, Kougami surprises. I will not say there's much development to his character, it's just us getting to know him. Kougami quickly turns out to be quite the genius, who is certainly skilled at his work but his life is solely focused on his own agenda. Kougami is hard to understand, and even harder to declare as good or bad. His decisions will leave you wondering about the very nature of his character. Even after watching PP twice, I'm still not sure whether I should call him villain or hero. But certainly, for most people, he is a very likeable character. \nAnd then to the villain, Makishima: \nI cannot say much about him without spoiling all of the plot. What I can and will say is that he fights for his own sense of justice, and therefore - as with Kougami - it becomes hard  to declare him good or bad. He and Kougami are in some ways very a like.  Makishima is a bright, interesting and also  annoyingly likeable villain - he can maybe be compared a bit to Light ( of Death Note). \nThe rest of the characters are supports, and I will not write about them individually. As a whole the supports are, as usually, very different of personality. Therefore there is a character for almost anyone to like - and also the characters supplement each other nicely. Kagari, for instance, creates the bit of humour PP has got. I also think there is an appropriate amount of supports, enough to make the story coherent and few enough to not make the story confusing.\nThe characters have a few seen-before elements, but are all in all both likeable, sensible and make the story move forward = 9/10.\nI will not put enjoyment as part of my rating, but I will say that I enjoyed the series a lot. Psycho Pass has become one of my fave series and is definitely worth a watch. \nThank you if you took the time to read this abnormally large review :), I apologize for any clerical/grammatical errors, I am not english XDD.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=114,  ["text"]="                          \n    Crime is a constant in human civilization. Theft, murder, and countless other atrocities have been committed  by people in every civilization throughout history; try as we might, humans have always had trouble preventing crimes from happening, let lone eliminating them completely. However, what if advancement in technology eventually provided a system that could accurately assess a person's capacity to commit a crime? That is the question posed in Production I.G.'s dystopian sci-fi crime thriller Psycho-Pass: a searing, violent, and ambitious exploration of crime, justice, and the system that judges which is right in a society. Filled with interesting concepts, it is unfortunate that the\n          \n        show ultimately falls short of its great ambition.\nSome have dubbed Psycho-Pass as the 'Minority Report' of anime, a very justifiable accusation. The basic premise of a system that can judge if someone might commit a crime before they commit it is something that Psycho-Pass shares with that Tom Cruz Sci-Fi flick (which itself is based off a short story by Philip K. Dick), but the systems in the two are quite different. Minority Report has psychic 'Precogs' that have prophesies of the future. Psycho-Pass has the Sibyl System, a grand sprawling technological network that monitors everything in Psycho-Pass's futuristic Japan through scanners and patrol drones. The Sibyl System scans and determines what are the 'best' courses for the lives of the citizens that live under it. In addition to that, the Sibyl System also scans peoples' mental health, tendencies, etc. to measure their probability of committing crimes; called their \"Psycho-Pass\". This is a complex, well detailed set-up that harkens back to classic dystopian sci-fi. At the same time, given how much control the Sibyl System has over this futuristic society, it could be argued that it is also too self-aware of a set-up. Despite so many of the characters saying how the current peace would be impossible without the system, it reeks of oppressiveness from the first episode.\nThe MWPSB is the law enforcement in this futuristic version of Japan; composed of latent criminals called 'Enforcers' and high ranking Inspectors that keep the Enforcers in check. The story centers around a new Inspector, Akane Tsunemori, and one of the Enforcers under her command, Shinya Kougami. While at first Akane seems rather uninteresting as the milquetoast rookie, she develops greatly as the show progresses. She starts off  as wide-eyed, naive, idealistic but unsure of herself; surrounded by characters that look like they will outshine her throughout the show. However, as she becomes more acquainted with the uglier side of humanity through her work in the MWPSB, she begins to see that the system of justice she serves under is far from flawless, yet sees its necessity and can't find it in herself to outright  betray it. She also struggles with the relationship between Inspector and Enforcer, as she learns from and values Kougami's input even as those around her  advise her against it. Kougami's development is less remarkable. While he is certainly one of the more interesting characters in the show, being a resourceful and very capable former detective with a dangerous mystery to him, his development is limited to his growing obsession with the show's antagonist, Shougo Makishima.\nMajority of the characters suffer from the same lack of complex development. Not to say they don't get any development, in fact many of the Inspectors and Enforcers of the MWPSB get plenty of scenes and in some cases complete episodes dedicated to developing them. However, just as with Kougami, most of their development is too narrow in scope. To be honest, many of the characters are given too little to do, making any development they do get feel kind of extraneous or irrelevant. The silver tongued antagonist Shougo Makishima is an exception. He is well read, charismatic, and completely ruthless; in love with the ugliest facets of human nature. Makishima justifies his actions with a twisted rhetoric that the Sibyl System forces people to deny their inner desires and so those who live under it are not truly living; a somewhat convincing argument given how much control Sibyl has over society. Even still, he brings out the worst in people, convincing them to do the most horrifying of crimes.\nWriter Gen Urobuchi pens the series with the sadistic shocks and twists he has become known for. With an intricate dystopian setting to serve as his playground, 'Urobucher' concocts many twisted scenarios; from a case that involves a disturbed 'artist' who makes her works from the bodies of her victims, to a demented game of survival in a subterranean maze. He then goes to grander mayhem of civil unrest and armed uprising, while simultaneously delving into sinister coverups involving the Sibyl System's true nature. It's unpleasant and discomforting in the best way; it is hard to turn away from the violent atrocities taking place before your eyes. However, Urobuchi's treatment of the show's themes is very heavy-handed. As mentioned earlier, the premise itself already makes the Sibyl System an oppressive force; Urobuchi pounds this in unnecessarily. When people are so brainwashed that they wouldn't recognize an act of violence before their eyes without help from the Sibyl System stretches believability of the situation. It doesn't help when the show (mostly Makishima) starts quoting classic books and poetry without giving a clear context to them. Some of the conversations between characters can at times also be a little convoluted, sounding less like natural dialogue and more like the writer trying to make a point of the conversation. This isn't to say the show's ideas are poorly handled, Akane's predicament and actions after she finds out the truth of the Sybil system proves the contrary, however it could have been handled with far more nuance.\nPsycho-Pass is solid on the technical side of things. Production I.G. is known for well produced shows, particularly well produced sci-fi shows, and Psycho-Pass follows in that tradition for the most part. The character designs by Hitman Reborn mangaka Akira Amano are attractive, though heavy on the bishounen look. The high tech metropolis looks impressive as one might expect, filled with technological marvels and innumerable people. An early scene of Akane getting ready to start the day in her apartment showcases how advanced and integral technology has become in this future society, as well as being a pretty flashy scene on its own right. The visuals also often feel fittingly oppressive, with mechanical observers keeping an eye on the subservient populous. When the story calls for it, the visuals can be shockingly violent, depicting beatings and murders with visceral detail. There are a few production hiccups, most notably an episode which the show's production staff actually apologized for, but overall it is a really good effort visually. The music is mostly intense orchestrations with a few classical pieces (notably Beethoven's Ode to Joy), which serves the show's atmosphere very well. Though, there are times the music becomes overenthusiastic, blaring out and over-dramatizing a few scenes. The ending themes by Egotist are nice on the ears and are usually transitioned well at the end of an episode, but the two openings are more notable for their visuals than the songs they feature.\nPsycho-Pass is a fine example of high concept sci-fi. While the futuristic setting has a decidedly dystopian feel, it is still very interesting and provides some nice food for thought. The show's attempt to explore the concepts of crime and justice through the overlord like Sibyl System is an admirable one, and through its central character Akane it draws some fascinating conclusions. Which makes it a shame the show can too often be needlessly heavy-handed, leaving the feeling that the show could have handled its themes with more grace and would have been better for it. The underwhelming development for characters other than Akane is also a bit of a detriment, especially since some of these characters get a good amount of screen time. Even still, Psycho-Pass is certainly worth the watch as a bleak, visceral, wickedly  entertaining thriller.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=107,  ["text"]="                          \n    Hey you, turn on the news. \nWhat might be the first thing you see? It might be something like, “today in this peaceful community....police are looking for your help in identitying this suspect wanted for […]. If you have any other information, please contact your local authorities”. \nSeriously, how often do you hear that? Most people who tune in the news daily probably would be half a dozen times a day. In the world of Psycho-Pass, the series takes crime to a whole new level with its advanced technology. Yet at the same time, hope and justice exists as the Enforcement Division uses technology of\n          \n        their own to apprehend criminals and eliminate them as a threat to society. \nPsycho-Pass is an original series that debuted on the noitamina network featuring a setting of a dystopian future. The series may be synonymous to the term, “psychopath” that reflects on a twisted individual's state of being. But any rate, the series takes place in a future where it has become possible to instantaneously measure and quantify a person's state of mind and personality. For that purpose, the term “Psycho-Pass” is used to refer the measure of an individual's being. In such a world, those with high Psycho-Pass levels are considered a threat to society and it is up to the Enforcement Division to eradicate them. \nWe need to think about this though:\nHumans aren't perfect and we are all capable of making mistakes. The degree of these mistakes varies but all have consequences. However, should we really be punished before the action is committed? Should we be judged based on a system rather than morality? What if there is a flaw in the system and something goes wrong? It seems that some of these questions/ideas becomes a conflict for those who follows the system. \nEssentially, the series makes an excellent pilot episode as well as the main themes of the series. The way Gen Uroboichi (PMMM, Fate/Zero S2, Phantom Requiem) handles this series traces down some of his other ways of dealing with his previous works. The themes of dealing with the future and thriller like moods are both present and beautifully executed. In fact, the series follows what police and the government can do in the future with technology like we have never seen before. It is quite an enthralling idea. Just think about it: reducing crime or rather, eradicating it before it even happens and prevent the damage. Maintaining public order in a dystopian world is never easy but the Enforcement Division is there to tackle the job.\nUnfortunately, the series' themes tries a bit too hard occasionally with its philosophical and confusing speeches. In particular, the seemingly antagonist of the series stays in the background most of the time. More precisely, he is shown to be a humanist who embraces the idea of cruelty and the dark side of the human mind. It is possible that he even views himself as an immortal with the way he handles torture of his victims, either physically or mentally. He even makes twisted dialogues portraying a lot of old culture and seemingly becomes a distraction in occasional episodes with his Shakespearen-like monotones.\nThe themes of the series are also not new or too original as some people may think. The idea of a dystopian setting and working for a government in a futuristic setting can be traced in other anime series such as Ghost in the Shell and Ergo Proxy. In fact, viewers might even find some of its similarities so similar that it's almost like a season 3 of GiS. As such, police drama with cyberpunk and mysteries are involved. Even in live action movies, themes similar to Psycho-Pass exists such as those in The Minority Report, a film loosely based on Philip K. Dick. The point is that the although promising, it may or may not be new for veteran anime fans into the franchise. Regardless though, the series' idea is still interesting with its dark backgrounds and writing courtesy of Urobutcher.\nAs mentioned before, the series takes off with an explosive start and shows that such a dystopian world is truly dangerous. It does drag off balance a little though in the beginning episodes that seemingly may distract the viewers a bit. Examples of this includes the seemingly virtual world, stage attacks, and those fan service bits of Akane. However, it still maintains a high level of interest for viewers especially later on when new characters are introduced and some intertwined plots become connected through the criminal activities and mysteries. Some of the thriller endings are also capable of keeping a viewer at the edge of their seats as they make a viewer wonder “what will happen next?...”\nPsycho-Pass continues to maintain its balance of character casts. They work together as a team with the unit because in the end, it takes teamwork and skills to finish the task. (and with a little help with the Dominator of course)  \nThe main male protagonist in the series is a young man named Shinya Kougami who is tough, independent, and skilled in what he does. Ironically, he has a high criminal mentality himself but circumstances has allowed him to become part of the solution. Working with him on various assigned tasks is the female protagonist of the series, Akane Tsunemori. She joined the department for a different reason than Shinya but otherwise becomes part of the solution as well. Unlike Shinya however, she is more delicate who makes up the team with her intelligence rather than brawn. She seems to serve as the foil of Shinya and possibly even become a future love interest of his. The two shares an awkward relationship but it is clear that they care for one another, especially Shinya who seems to go his ways to help and protect her. The other characters of the team and cast also plays various roles although their spotlights are lessened in the series. Yet, they do balance out the team. We have the enthuastic and outgoing Shuusei Kagari who often makes jokes during the job that brightens the mood of the story. On the other hand, Yayoi Kunizuka maintains her calm composure during any situation and shrives to get the job done right. Then, there's Nobuchika Ginoza who has the most experience on the team and thus serves a sort of mentor for the others in order to ensure the success of a mission. Others such as Tomomi Masaoka and Shion Karanomori also play their roles. Ultimately, it's up to the entire team and their skills collectively as well working together to make the city a better place to live in.\n*****WARNING***** \nThe series is quite violent both physically and psychologically. Even in the very first episode, the criminals are shown to be merciless and violent. In fact, the very first criminal in the series that we see is a kidnapper, potential rapist, and possible murderer. It is no wonder his criminal mentality level is so high. The psychological part of Psycho Pass exists as well especially involving the main antagonist with his way of speeches. The way he talks through metaphors and expressing his ideas while having an English song being played can be a bit disturbing. It's not exactly something a viewer should watch before they go to sleep at night.\nThe way the series handles the fates of criminals with high level of Psycho-Pass is also brutal. Every time the Dominator claims a new life breeds a new scene of gruesome death, where the body splatters  upon impact. The blood fills the screen and employs those shock values of violence and gore. Even when the target evades the move, it makes it seem it's just a matter of time they meet their ultimate fate. It doesn't stop there either. Fan service are also present especially with Akane and later on at school where artwork is seemingly portrayed as a way of sexualizing dead bodies where even cases of necrophilia is present. At some point, viewers will realize the various shock shown and what Psycho-Pass is as a series: a dark and gruesome presentation in the dystopian world.\nThe point? DO NOT WATCH if you can't take this. Trust me, you won't make it. \n*********************\nThe artwork of the series is quite dark and I mean it literally. Even in the beginning episodes, it's hard to make out what exactly is happening until you take a closer examination. This shouldn't be a surprise though as in most dystopia series, such visuals are used to convey the serious mood and dark backgrounds. Koji Eto (Fate/Zero, Garden of Sinners, Steins;Gate) serves as the art director and the man gets the job done with his talents. With his already talented skills in crafting and directing darker themed series, Psycho-Pass brings those backgrounds of violence, cruelty, and darkness into the series quite well. The CGI usage of those dominator also shows the technology side of the P-P world. It's quite enthralling to look at and see how far everything has come through in such a futuristic dystopian setting. \nLikewise, the soundtrack makes an impression. Yoshikazu Iwanami (Another, Koi Kaze, Deadman Wonderland) orchestrates the score and makes his skills known throughout the eerie sound rythyms in later episodes. In some of the scenes, English folktale music is used to reflect some of the moods of dark violence that expresses itself metaphorically. An example would be in one of the arcs where “Rule Britannia” is seemingly played during a rather disturbing scene. Employment of this is rare in anime series these days and makes some of the arcs that much more darker.\nThe opening song is performed quite well in general. Abnormalize by Ling Tosite Sigure plays a montage of the gruesome backgrounds of the series with some montages of the main characters. The lyrics “secret kills for you” is occasionally heard that brings the haunting words to life in the anime series. Likewise, Egoist makes their name known for their talent in both of their ED songs. Although not too realistic, it is catchy and fits within that P-P way, just the way it ought to be.\nUltimately, Psycho-Pass is a blockbuster series that can be quite a blast especially those into a futuristic setting involving police detective fiction. It's hard to say that the series is really for everyone especially those who have problems with the violence, gore, and psychological thriller themes expressed. It looks like P-P does try quite hard occasionally, but in such a world, there needs to be order. The series makes a great usage of its dystopia future while staying to the point without going off track too much. Science fiction often incorporates the package of alien invasion, going into a virtual world for conquest/domination, or time travel. Psycho Pass takes that genre and transforms it into a product that is appealing with its dynamics beyond those typical themes. However at many instances, I do feel that the series falls apart with its plot. Still though, it was a nice watch for me. \nNow, what that's being said and done, season 2 may be on the horizon. Crime coefficient levels? Hell, if I'd know. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=93,   ["text"]="                          \n    It has been a while since there has been a dystopian, psychological, police thriller of this popularity since Ghost in The Shell first aired. Writer Urobuchi Gen, famous for his works on the Fate/Stay Night series, and Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, decided to use his deft hand at writing and give us his own twisted version of the future. Psycho Pass is a dystopian crime thriller, centered around human morality. Is it right to sacrifice individual freedom, for safety? Is it right to condemn someone for something they might do? \n Sadly, Psycho Pass falls short of greatness due to uneven pacing, some pretty poor\n          \n        character development for certain characters and what I find to be a lackluster conclusion. \nStory(7/10)- Psycho Pass is set in the future, where it is possible to measure the \"soul\" of a person using a device installed on each citizen called the 'Psycho Pass'. Using an advanced A.I. system called the ' Sybil System,' the police are now able  to measure a person's mental state and the chance that they will commit a crime. \nThe first episode starts off very strong where we see the female protagonist, Akane Tsunemori, tackle her very first case and particularly gruesome one. The viewers are introduced to the obvious flaw of the Sybil System, that people under significant psychological stress are criminals. The episodes after that are very slow moving. Most of these story arcs are dreadfully boring and seem to drag on forever. It isn't until episode 8 where things really start to pick up when we are introduced to the antagonist, Makishima Shogo. It is only when he appears do the themes of Psycho Pass solidify and we see the potential this show truly has. Sadly, the poor ending ruins what could have been a great series. The producers of the show obviously wanted to leave room for a second season if the show did well enough, and that was to the show's detriment. \nNow, I must give psycho pass credit, because all the themes were implemented flawlessly. For example, a big theme in Psycho Pass is emotional repression. The people in that society view expressing an type of emotion as negative out of fear that they will be punished by the Sybil System. As a result, the society is in a vegetative state, and act almost like zombies. They feel no empathy towards each other, they do nothing to help one another, all they are concern is about the state of their Psycho Pass.  The world in Psycho-Pass is fleshed out to the point of believability. \nArt(6/10)- The most obvious flaw has to be the animation. In this day and age, there is no excuse for the animation to be like this. It is often very choppy, and there are some poorly drawn characters. This does not make the show unwatchable by any means, heck sometimes the show looks great like in the first episode, but those moments are few and in between.\nSound(7/10)- The BGM wasn't very noticeable, and when it was, it didn't really add or take anything away from the scenes. The Opening and ending songs are very catchy though.\nCharacter(7/10)- In a show like Psycho-Pass, characters are essential to moving the plot forward. If the characters are bad, then the show will fall flat on its face. Luckily, the cast of characters aren't bad but they are not as developed as I would have liked them to be. First we have Akane Tsunemori, a new and heavily idealistic detective to the police force. In early episodes, she comes off as a ditz, and relatively boring. It isn't until the midway through the series she starts to develop. Her confidence emerges as she becomes a more experienced and competent detective. Sadly, in the last few episodes, her personality does a complete 180 and she regresses to an even worse state than she was at the beginning of the show. The other protagonist, Shinya Kougami is literally nothing more than a foil character. He does cool things from time to time, and can spew George Orwell quotes like no tomorrow , but he is a relatively shallow character. He seems stuck in the past, but it is debatable whether the writers did that purposefully. The rest of the cast aside from the villains, add little to nothing to the show.\nThe crown jewel of this series has to be Makishima Shogo, the \"villain,\" of the series. I put villain in quotes because it is up to the perspective of the viewer to decide if he is truly evil or not. His motives are always shrouded in mystery, making it hard to know what he will do next. He is calm, focused but never carries an air of malevolence like most of anime villains. Shogo vaguely reminds me of Johann Liebert from Naoki Urasawa's famed manga series, Monster. And that is no little accomplishment. It is a shame that his character was dragged down by the end of the show.\nIs Psycho Pass a masterpiece? Not by any stretch of imagination. Is it a bad show? Absolutely not. Psycho Pass, if anything, is a sign of things to come. It is a sign that, hopefully, that there will be more anime with a message rather than generic harem or romcom shows. I give Psycho Pass a 7/10. \n        "},

		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=86,   ["text"]="                          \n    Urobuchi Gen certainly made name for himself during last couple seasons. Known for his dark and edgy, sometimes nihilistic approach to writing that leaves trail of bodies and broken characters, it's hard to overlook his works. His works of Fate/zero and Madoka, that definitively left impact on anime scene for better or worse, coupled with Production I.G. creative history of making Ghost in the Shell franchise, made me hope that we would get darker, more Urobuchi-like version of GitS, something I would definitively enjoy a lot. Unfortunately, it didn't take too long to me to get disillusioned that such dream wouldn't come true due to\n          \n        flawed logic and broken foundations of society that entire Psycho Pass world resides upon. Review will contain spoilers of series, so if you don't wish to be spoiled, turn away.\nPsycho-Pass starts out nicely, introducing us to rookie Inspector Tsunemori Akane venturing into world of Public Safety Bureau, unit specialized for apprehending criminals and suspects judged by all seeing eye that is called Sibyl System. Under supervision of very same system, Bureau works to discover potential threats to society and solve various cases where rules of System have been broken. Hierarchy in Bureau is very clear; Inspectors, such as Akane supervise Enforcers such as Kougami Shinya, former convicts or outcasts of society that Sibyl System decided to recruit as manpower in upholding order. \nSeries continues in episodic way introducing us to world and some specifics in line of work of Bureau such as reliance on Enforcers' ways of solving cases; it takes a dog to hunt a dog. Another nice catch in dog-master relationship between Enforcers and Inspectors are Dominator guns, designed to target only people with high crime coefficient judged by Sibyl. That way it is ensured that dogs remain dogs and cannot rebel against System or endanger innocent people, while Inspector can always point gun towards Enforcer and pacify him due to his high crime coefficient. Psycho-Pass does a great job of introducing us to dystopian, or even utopian world, depending on interpretation, as well as people's concerns over it, both inside of Bureau and in outer world, such as when Akane's friends discuss about their concern with career that is predetermined by System.\nUnfortunately, as series progresses it becomes clear that only way Psycho-Pass will hold viewer entertained is by adding body count. People we know nothing about, we care nothing about are killed by the same people we don't know/care, whose motives are vague and deluded, in horrible ways, kinda Urobuchi's trademark, but relevance of these events is practically nonexistent except perhaps explaining motives of Psycho-Pass main antagonist, Makishima Shogo and his views on current state of society. Show keeps on using shock elements, such as brutal murders, public chaos, blood and gore to keep up  entertainment value. And it does its job well. On the flip side, it adds no intellectual or emotional value to story, but only pictures Sibyl System and Bureau as incompetent bunch, not being able to handle even minor riot started by bunch of renegades immune to Sibyl's judgment. Dominators, their first line of defense against chaos are worthless. Such system maintains lives of countless people across whole country and yet as very smallest problem and it becomes unsolvable until fatal damage has been dealt. But I'll get to juicy details of Sibyl being fundamentally flawed later. For now let's talk characters.\nSeries and Bureau have rather wealthy cast, and as such, it's not possible to fully develop every single one of them. There is more focus on our love triangle of Makishima, Akane and Kougami while rest of the cast are there merely to present view on Sibyl, or sometimes they even receive some development, but it's nothing to write home about, except Ginoza that receives some good development by the end of the series. Akane is easily best character in show and her development is well done. Transformation from rookie with shaking knees into full fledged Inspector with strength to stand for herself, being a guide to future generations of Inspectors to come is really impressive. Makishima would be so proud of how much she changed since their first meeting. Speaking of Makishima, I'm kinda iffy on him. He does represent man with strong sense of individuality, wanting to liberate people from System's *evil* control. If that's the case then what is point of enjoying watching people suffer and messing with others' lives? And on occasions he transforms from *poet* into mindless shounen antagonist wanting to kill everyone in his path. Inconsistent characterization much? What could have been great character was reduced to your random unmemorable guy. Kougami also received great deal of exposure throughout the series and his character is well built. As he degraded into state of mere hound he relies a lot on his instinct when solving cases giving series a lot of dynamics. Coupled with aggressive, if I may say rash approach in solving cases and strong believes towards his own justice rather than relying on Sibyl's judgment, he is definitively entertaining character to watch and works well as main male character overall. One character that I found to my liking despite having lack of screen time is Tomomi Masaoka. He represents the old way of thinking about detective business and due to him being unable to adapt to Sibyl he became Enforcer. High crime coefficient or not, he still remained good person despite Sibyl's tag on him and a good father. This is way to off character and have impact on viewer, (as well as Ginoza) not some nameless, faceless dolls that served no purpose in the first place. \nThat being said, there is one hidden gem in characters, one that deserves special mention for breaking the show. Yes, it's everyone's favorite Sibyl System itself. We can tag it as character, no? It is understandable that Sibyl wants to recruit people that they cannot judge as it would add another dimension to understanding similar type of people as well as lengthen duration of System itself. Brains don't last forever after all. But how in the world would such system came into existence in the first place? From what I see recruits and members of Sibyl are people with strong individuality, different view on world or in another words, social outcasts, people that must not exists in world by Sibyl standards. Such people, treated as junk, criminals and defects would then form a cornerstone of what is meant to watch over country and ensure that everyone is judged by same standards with fairness? Really? After all, same society treated them like trash, and now they are here to ensure those very same people live happily ever after? Did Urobuchi become too soft or what? If I were one of them I sure as hell know where I would send them to. And even if what I said is hypothetically not true, we have living recruit of the System. What did Makishima do when he was invited to join? Yeah, exactly that. Smacked Kasei, broke few bones or circuits and gtfo'd away. At this point in series I was actually hoping Makishima would join into Sibyl and work against it from the inside rather than trying one man army entire System himself. It would make sense seeing how much freedom is actually granted in system just by talking with Chief Kasei, who was his old apprentice. He could have noticed that man behind mask isn't collective mind of Sibyl but rather an individual that he actually knows and can recognize his personal traits. He could have easily seen that individuality still exists inside Sibyl and work from there, especially considering how much authority is given to you, going as far as to change Dominator readings, as seen when Ginoza was meant to shoot Kougami. Easy way to mess up entire system in eyes of common people, working from inside. But no, he decided to solo the world, and that task was pretty easy actually, considering 99% of food for country is produced on one field and he only needs to mess food production. What was purpose of this again? To make one mutation or one disease (or one Makishima) to wipe out entire food supply of a whole country? I call that sloppy writing. And how did Sibyl ever come into existence? Following the same trend – sloppy writing. \nSloppy writing aside, technical parts of the show are ok for the most part. Animation, albeit inconsistent at times does its job well by showing Psycho-Pass world as it is. Action sequences are well done, not much complains. Character designs are fitting to dark mood of series and technology is designed pretty well, especially Dominator guns. Sound is another strong point of series as all openings/endings are catchy themes with fitting lyrics to set mood of show and are also choreographed well. Sound throughout the series is good, from sound of bones breaking to musical background fitting to scenes and it's used well to improve overall atmosphere. Special award for best voice acting goes to Hanazawa Kana for voicing Akane. From her shaky starting lines all the way up to her confident self, voice acting remains great and always fitting Akane's character.\nEnding of series was done very well with some things left open to interpret as seeing fit, but after dust settles all we have is another sci-fi anime that didn't use its premise well, but rather used fanservice named gorefest and Urobuchi's name to sell. If you like to see body count rising and people suffering, chances are you will end up loving Psycho-Pass a lot. Police business and individual cases are interesting, and it's fun to see how characters have to actually use brains here and there to solve cases. Action is decent throughout the whole show, and overall experience of show is pretty positive, but if you actually wanted something that can use full potential of given setting, you might be a bit disappointed in presentation. I only hope that Urobuchi becoming too mainstream won't affect his writing too much in his future works, but seeing trending of mainstream things, inside or outside anime industry, it feels like rather ominous sign. Then again, it might just be me reading into it too much..."},

What matters is that you come to that decision yourself. That you agonize over it and eventually accept it.\" -Akane Tsunemori\nPsycho-Pass is essentially a psychological-action anime with a sci-fi based setting driving the story line. \n\nThe Story: 9/10\n-------------------\nPsycho-Pass is set in the future where you are able to easily see the mental state of one's mind. This is given a number, a number relating to one's contingency of creating a crime, called the 'Crime Coefficient' if it is over the normal rate. These persons are apprehended, if not disposed of if reached too high.\n          \n        Inspector Akane Tsunemori and Shinya Kougami are both part of the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division, which is in charge of maintaining order with the use of the Sibyl System. Sibyl connects with the Dominators Enforcers and Inspectors use to hunt for the latent criminals. On her first day Akane Tsunemori meets with Inspector Nobou Okura and the two, with the Enforcers are labelled to take down the cause of the Area Stress level. Nobuchika Ginoza, Shinya Kōgami, Shūsei Kagari and Tomomi Masaoka are introduced as the first Enforcers seen in the story. \nIn the first episode, you will feel slightly information-dumped with the expectation that you will remember each person’s name. After getting into this series a bit more, you will conveniently find that this is not the case. The producers have made it very clear and easy who’s communicating to whom. The rules or what you can and cannot do with the Dominators are shown over time in the series and the motives characters are very well defined in the story. There are small side stories within the anime, but they all intertwine at a point within the series in some way or another. The links between each case is put together very astutely. Execution of this concept is what made the story very interesting in such a way different to other anime with a mystery and crime genre. There are a couple of episodes slightly not as fulfilling, maybe only two. But don't let these ones deter you away from the anime, they're just very dialogue driven and provide more insight into the characters.\nThe Art: 9/10\n----------------\nThe animation here was very well done. Background effects brought a dark feel to the even darker plot. It enhanced the experience of the story in such a way that it felt very real. Either foreground of background the designs of objects, characters and material were very well done. Character designs in the anime were all very different. None of the characters art looks like it had its shape copy/pasted and put different things on. This includes the supporting characters- of which there are many. Dark color shading to every object will undoubtedly annoy some people to not see a change in texture, but because of this the theme of Psycho-Pass is reinforced. \nThe Sound: 8/10\n--------------------\nThe sound here seemed to have high audio quality. EGOIST and ryo are great choices for creating the composition for Psycho-Pass. The visuals to make the OP for Psycho-Pass must have, undoubtedly taken quite a bit of time. The meaning behind the lyrics is very deep; it accompanies the art used to make the opening and ending scenes substantially high in quality. But, despite this it isn’t as addicting to listen to after finishing the actual anime. To get a clearer picture, you really must have the visual aid of the music segment while listening to enjoy it to its full extent. The voice acting was favourable, despite the voice mostly being in a serious tone. Understandably, because Psycho-Pass has a dark theme, there wouldn’t be any times when main characters were lively. In turn the voice actors could not express their skill fully in the anime. \nThe Characters: 10/10\n-------------------------\nAll of the main characters have their stories straightened out in Psycho-Pass. There is none, or, at the least very little times that you would question the past of one of the main characters. Shinya Kougami. He's the main male Enforcer in the story where there are 5 other Enforcers and 2 Inspectors working with him. He's enemies with Makishima, actually the villain of the story because of his connection with the Specimen Case. He tries to guide Akane onto the route of being a good Inspector while also looking after her- even saving her at times while trying to hunt for Makishima. He’s not much of a diverse character. Once he has made his mind of doing something he sticks with it. Akane is a bit of a tricky one. At times it seems like she has ‘feelings’ for Shinya and other times not as much. Her past is clearly defined in Psycho-Pass. She's a good strong one, who just needed a kick start to developing into a versatile character. One thats progress throughout the story can be seen very clearly. Makishima Shogo is the main villain in the story. He’s a sadist to the extreme degree, while maintaining his twisted views on the world where they would stay at the same point. His choices are well characterized and his logic and thoughtfulness put into each of these is very intriguing. The side characters are all entertaining and likable in some form. Each of the members in Unit One contributes greatly to the story line and helps to push it forward, while also relaxing tension in between scenes.\nThe Enjoyment: 10/10\n-------------------------\nOthers who enjoy a morbid feel in anime will most likely enjoy this. Personally, watching this was something new to me as I had not explored this genre before. I’m surprised how amazing and tense it can make you feel. I’ve only watched this series once through, and a couple of sections while writing this review. To me, it feels like a one-time-only anime. Unless you like to re-watch things, re-watching this won’t bring anymore enjoyment or chilly feelings as much as going through it the first time through. It would be a lot staler in its mystery and plot twists, as well as those climatic moments. After watching this quite a while ago, I can safely say that it’s actually not that memorable. After the first few days, for sure it will be in your mind after watching. But this thought will soon go away.\nOverall: 9/10\n----------------\nOverall with the solid ending and neat epilogue it makes this anime very worthwhile. As this anime has a very unique setting and plot, it’s recommended for those who can bear the heaviness this anime has."},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=82,   ["text"]="                          \n    The Butcher strikes again with an intense action set in a chilling dystopia that, regrettably, is one of his weakest works.\nSPOILER-FREE™\nIn early 22nd century Japan, it has become possible to analyze a human mind with a startling degree of accuracy using a network of scanners and an incredibly powerful supercomputer known as the SIByL System. To this end, the judicial system is no longer required for law enforcement. Police use the SIByL System’s abilities to judge a person’s mental state and depending on the situation, either arrest them so that they can undergo therapy, or carry out executions on the spot. Into this world is\n          \n        thrust the brilliant but inexperienced Inspector Tsunemori Akane. We follow the inspector and the rest of the Public Safety Bureau as they investigate the tenacious shadow of crime that haunts Japan, and learn more about the truth behind their “paradise.”\nOne thing that caught me off guard, which viewers should be aware of is that despite being an anime about police detectives, it is most definitely NOT a mystery. The pawns and masterminds of crime are made known to the audience quickly (read: in the intro). This is a fast-paced action anime much more than it is a mystery. An action anime that is quite dark and violent at times. Although Psycho-Pass does not thrive on gratuitous gore for shock value, it’s definitely way too much for younger audiences or those with a weak stomach.\nThe first thing you will notice about Psycho-Pass is that the story is served up on a silver platter of fluid animation and solid, yet disquieting music. Psycho-Pass’s presentation of the future transitions between sleek and gritty, but never boring. Be it the character designs or some high-tech contraption, there is always something pretty to look at. It’s no secret that Production I.G has a lot of money, and they obviously dropped big bucks to make this title look good. Unfortunately, Production I.G has acquired a nasty habit in recent times: making some parts of anime dazzling (especially the beginning) and hiding some less-than-outstanding work throughout the series as it goes on. This creates the perception that an anime is gorgeous, and once people have that impression in their minds the studio is free to be a little lazier when nobody’s looking. You can see this habit at work in other anime like Suisei no Gargantia and Shingeki no Kyojin. I noticed several conspicuously still backgrounds and simple designs especially in the middle-late part of the anime. These are the sorts of things I would consider run-of-the-mill in a typical anime, but it is precisely because Psycho-Pass is such an attractive anime that these lapses are so irritating.\nBut the substance behind the style is what really makes, and breaks, this anime. The setting of this anime is particularly excellent. The society we see at the beginning is safe, happy and free. But as Psycho-Pass continues, we learn that the pillars holding these values are actually rather fragile. Social problems, isolationism, unreliable technology and oppression lurk in the unilluminated shadows. This dystopia is definitely authoritarian, to the point of dictating possible jobs to people based on their abilities. But there are several examples of how it is not an Orwellian “Big Brother” society. The citizens are happy, without being brainwashed, quite reminiscent of Philip K. Dick.\nTherein lies the problem, Psycho-Pass is the world of Philip K. Dick, if they didn’t flat-out admit it in the anime they might almost be accused of plagiarism. Psycho-Pass is brazenly derivative of several other works, even anime. More than once I had to ask myself if I wasn’t watching Ghost in the Shell or reading Gulliver’s Travels. Psycho-Pass doesn’t even care if you know, in fact it wants you to know; it’s positively stolid.\nThe setting may be a little stale, but Urobuchi makes it work, the real point is what goes on in that setting. The Public Security Bureau may be the sword-arm of SIByL, but they do their job because they care about protecting people. As they are faced with a string of brutal crimes, it gradually becomes as obvious to them as it is to the audience that there is a connection. The focus of Psycho-Pass is not so much what is behind these crimes, but why. At first, it seems the only motivation is the sadism and insanity of distasteful malcontents, but the more complex picture is gradually revealed. In this sense, the story is very well put-together. Forced storytelling is nowhere in sight; I was fully expecting one of the detectives to produce a totally rectally-derived solution to an investigation, but to my delight, it never happened. There are no plot holes and the elements of the story come together strongly as nobody is “right” or “wrong.”\nThe characters are flawed and very compelling, compounded by excellent voice acting across the cast. Even side characters have believable thoughts and motivations. The three main characters are all superb. Tsunemori’s development can be a little jerky and opaque at times, but she shows tremendous, yet believable, strength of character. She is presented with several difficult decisions and her reactions are all reasonable, earning her praise and scorn from others. Kougami struggles with his ideals against his feelings and past, which is satisfactorily explored without being too excessive. He has little faith in the society that shuns him, but embittered though he is, he tries to do the right thing.\nMakishima is a spectacular villain. At first it seems he is merely an evil psychopath, which he most definitely is. However, his motivations and methods reveal an intricate character, almost noble in some ways. Some viewers may even root for him at some points, and not just those who support the bad guy to be edgy.\nOne of the biggest problems with Psycho-Pass is the sometimes incomprehensible rationale behind it. The science (often pseudoscience) of the show is extremely confusing at times. The technology is especially baffling, particularly the Dominator weapon system. I will refrain from spoilers, only I think that it must be designed expressly with storytelling potential in mind, with any practical concerns neatly cast away. There are also a few times when the characters are equally obtuse. I recall a small squad of police bursting in on an injured and unarmed criminal and shooting him without hesitation. One character promptly wonders aloud who the criminal was talking to and whether he was working alone. Apparently it never once occurred to him that he might get that information from the man himself. This infuriating quirk only gets worse as the anime goes on.\nPsycho-Pass is very pretentious at times. It asks some moderately philosophical questions, but like the setting, nothing even approaches originality. It wants to provide dumbed-down action without sacrificing its air of deepness. Psycho-Pass isn’t a “bad” anime by any stretch of the word, in fact it is quite entertaining. But it isn’t nearly as intelligent as it thinks it is.\n        "},

I will try to fix that as I continue to grow as a writer!*\nBy now I have watched many anime shows that covered almost every theme you could possibly think of, almost. Yeah, I say almost because once in a while an anime show in particular rises above them all. A show that introduces an idea in a new way. A show that diverges from the other dozens of shows that air along side it. But what makes an anime stand head and shoulder above the others? Could it be the story, characters, or (if you are like me)\n          \n        even the soundtrack that makes an anime outstanding? What if there was an anime that incorporates all of the above? Now that is an anime worth anybody's time.\nAnd that anime would be Psycho-Pass.\nSet in a futuristic Cyberpunk setting we dive into a high-tech and self-sustaining Japan where law and order are maintained by an all-powerful supercomputer dubbed \"The Sibyl System.\" By this system all people of Japan must obey and follow its every command and judgement, whether you consider it fair or not. However, all governing bodies aren't perfect. Everything has its flaws and imperfections, but when the very people who uphold this system's \"justice\" start to find out about these imperfections what would happen?\n=====\nStory\n=====\nPsycho-Pass starts off by introducing Tsunemorie Akane, a new Inspector for the Public Safety Bureau which upholds the laws set by the Sibyl System. The system that runs the country by judging every human mind individually, evaluating its talents, weaknesses, and even its potential to commit crimes. Through this system life is practically dictated to the civilians of Japan creating a Utopian society devoid of criminals and even potential criminals. But when Tsunemorie and Unit 1 stumble across a case that blatantly defies that very system they swore to protect all hell breaks loose as the very foundation of society is shaken by one man. \nThe story of Psycho-Pass is the meat of the entire show. The common theme of what's right and wrong is tossed around quite a bit. Even with that common theme being the backbone of Psycho-Pass it still found an entirely new way to present this overused theme. If society accepts or allows certain things does it make that certain thing right? Good? The Sibyl System just sounds too perfect...\nIf we all followed something unquestionably than wouldn't that make you no better than a pet? An animal that simply listens to what it is told? When man loses his will and ability to decide for himself can he truly be called a human? All these themes and questions ring loud and clear in Psycho-Pass. It was a true joy to see these old themes dressed and presented in new and compelling ways . Ways that would make me bite my nails and rock my chair back and forth until the next episode. \n=======\nCharacters\n=======\nBeing a show with such a deep, dark, an mature story we are given a cast that really showcased just how much potential the show really had. Shinya Kougami was that classic old-school protagonist that you just couldn't help but admire. He just screamed Spike Spiegel to me (which is a really good thing). An old-school classic character is always welcomed, but I always wanted to watch a show that had an antagonist that was cool, level-headed, dark, sinister, but yet a man an audience can sympathize with. \nEnter Shougo Makishima. \nNow I know plenty of you guys went through that, \"Hey! They totally stole my idea!\" Moment at least once when you watched a movie or show, well when I saw Shougo in his full glory in episode 11 I couldn't help but scream that out at the end of the episode. I finally found another show that diverged from those cookie-cutter antagonists that were always evil and had no sense or reason. Shougo had his reasons, and they were pretty damn good reasons too.\nBut we can't forget the mighty Akane Tsunemori. Though she played a small role for the first half of the show she finally had her due spotlight at the closing of the show which I greatly appreciated. She was a good breath of fresh air from all those other female protagonists out there (Yes! I am looking at you Inori). But I know half of my love for Akane comes through her God-like seiyuu, Hanazawa-chan.......I am a softy for cute and soothing voices, which are very much welcome in such a show as dark and gloomy as Psycho-Pass.\nAlong with the other inspectors and enforcers the cast was a big reason for this shows incredible story. (Give a shout out to that Yuri love with Shion and Yayoi!.....Sorry, I just couldn't let that go unsaid)\n============\nMusic and Animation\n============\nIf you haven't guessed already I tend to put a lot of value into animation and soundtracks. What makes those climax scenes, transitions, fight scenes, and even scenes with characters randomly staring up in the sky even more epic? Get Yoshikazu-sama to be your Sound Director! Come on people, this is the guy who had his hand in Baccano! The Main theme for Psycho-Pass is played through out the show on a piano, violin, and synthesizer. Each version played with their respective scenes flawlessly. The soundtrack gave so much life and definition to the anime that it just couldn't be ignored. Animation goes hand in hand with the music and Psycho-Pass hit it right on the nail. Though the art got choppy in later episodes (for understandable reasons), both were produced to masterful levels of brilliance. When the I saw the Dominator in action I couldn't help but desire one for my own personal use. Along with those artful explosions of blood and guts, we tend to see the insides of many people. This is rated R for a reason people, so try not to watch Psycho-Pass during your lunch break because you just might get Dominated! AHAHAHA, classic...Ahem, in any case,  Bravo Production I.G. \n=====\nOverall\n=====\nWhen an anime presents us a strong and emotional story line complimented by intricate and complex characters backed up by an art and music style that resounds with epic simplicity but yet amazing profoundness we find ourselves with a jaw-dropping anime: Psycho-Pass. The story and characters flesh out what makes a man a man. Conforming or reforming, mature themes that are tough to swallow. With a story that has so many things going on we can't really see the line of good and evil. That's were the beauty of Psycho-Pass lays hidden. This isn't a show that tells you what is right and wrong, this is a show that makes you decide. Decide for your own life, don't blindly follow things or people without reason. It is a good reminder to not get lost in today's world with so many conflicting views and accepted norms. What makes you human? Your Psycho-Pass? Or what YOU make of YOURSELF? But then again\n\"The SIByL Still Continues...\" \nA sequel that has the possibility of retaining or even surpassing it's predecessor? Sure as hell hope so.\n*This being my first review I thank you for reading it. Feedback and friendly criticism is welcomed! Once again, thank you.*"},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=50,   ["text"]="                          \n    To me, Psycho-Pass was great largely because of its world. The basic premise is \"What if we could tell criminal minds apart from normal ones?\", and in the show, the conclusion of this is that the governmental Sibyl System aggressively monitors your mental state, so that they can arrest or execute you provided you are sufficiently criminal. \nUsing the same scanning techniques, the state is able to assess your aptitude for different types of work and employ you accordingly. This is all nice on paper, but quickly leads into murky waters - is it really fair to deny someone the opportunity to try their hand\n          \n        at (say) forming a band because you know they wouldn't be any good at it? If this makes them unhappy and eventually criminal, is punishing them really completely fair? \nTo its credit, Psycho-Pass does raise some of these questions. However, they are usually avoided because most of the show's criminals are portrayed as complete monsters for the sake of narrative convenience. When the show raises the question of whether we can equate the Sibyl System with justice, it is somewhat hard to take it seriously, because virtually all the criminals we have seen at that point are completely without redeeming qualities. I feel like the show could really have used a few down-to-earth criminals with relatable motives.\nMy second main problem with the show is its main story, and specifically the ending. Obviously I can hardly go into it without causing spoilers, but put shortly I was really disappointed by how some of the final reveals were resolved. Also, I really didn't care much for the main antagonist. Despite occasional flashes of brilliance, he struck me as a worn-out mix of standard anime tropes.\nThough I guess I have been mostly harsh on the show, I overall quite liked it. The world itself is immensely interesting, and my main problem is that I hoped the show would do more with it. Even though it doesn't, though, it still manages to pull off 22 very entertaining episodes with virtually no downtime or filler, and it makes for a very satisfying mix of action and horror. Provided you aren't looking for a hugely cerebral show, I would definitely recommend Psycho-Pass.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=41,   ["text"]="                          \n    When I started watching Psycho-Pass, I knew next to nothing about the series, save for two things: One, that it was made by the infamous Urobutcher, and two, that it came highly recommended all around. This conflict puzzled me to no end, but soon it all became clear...\nLet's talk about the story. My favorite genre is sci-fi/cyberpunk, so it's no surprise, that my favorite author is Phillip K. Dick. I've read every single one of his books/novels, so it's kinda strange I didn't realize until the last few episodes, that Psycho-Pass is a homage to many of Dick's works, most notably \"Minority Report\" and \"Do\n          \n        Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?\". Aside from the main plot, there is a strong underlying theme questioning the nature of human existence, reality and society. Psycho-Pass introduces a \"perfect society\" where the populace is fully controlled and sedated into a constant state of complacency by a totalitarian artificial system. Free will is all but abolished, the central system SIBYL decides everything for everyone including aspirations, job aptitudes, entertainment, it practically plans your future for you. Everyone is monitored via the \"psycho-pass\", a system that constantly monitors every person's state of mind and stress levels using a color and hue scale. The system also calculates the person's \"crime coefficient\", a number that predicts the chance of the person committing a crime, so the authorities can remove unwanted and dangerous elements from society BEFORE they commit said crimes (much like in Minority Report). Everyone, who's psycho-pass levels deviate from the norm at any time (their passes become \"cloudy\") are sent to therapy and in extreme cases even incarceration or execution. The system's judgment is absolute and there is zero tolerance or chance for appeal. Once you are deemed a danger to society by the machine, you are labeled as a \"latent criminal\", even if you haven't actually done anything illegal in your life. But, what happens when the system fails? What happens when it doesn't?\nIt's very hard to admit, but Urobuchi Gen is the perfect person to bring Dick's world to life. They share the same nihilistic, ambiguous view on right and wrong, human existence/behaviour and they both question the values of society. Psycho-Pass spends an equal amount of time on fast-paced, gory action and drawn out dialogues and moralizing, which this time around are both integral parts of the experience and never overpower each other.  Many people criticize the pacing of the story, but there is actually way more in the \"slower\" episodes than meets the eye, and all of it is part of the build-up and character progression, and it all ultimately leads to a satisfying payoff in the end.\nPsycho-Pass is a heavily character-driven piece, and many things can be said about the \"Urobutcher\", but he is without doubt a master of writing intriguing, life-like character-world integration. The characters themselves standing alone are nothing special, even bland and empty, but when placed into the world, they \"click\" into the story like missing puzzle pieces. As in Dick's stories, there is no clear cut \"Good vs Evil\", the protagonists and the antagonists are all well-rounded characters with their own goals, motivations and reasons for doing things. A story about beautiful lies and ugly truths, deplorable heroes and noble villains and you are never exactly sure which is which. It keeps turning the tables on the viewer as the story progresses and you get to know more and more about the characters. It's refreshing to see a series that keeps you on your toes, where you can never be sure what's behind the corner.\nThe art direction seemed a little weird at first, especially the characters themselves, but it quickly grew on me. The mix of CGI and traditional animation is very well suited for the sci-fi/cyberpunk theme, and it's never obnoxious or overbearing, all firmly rooten in a realistic setting. There is a huge attention to detail regarding the world and it's inner workings. All the technology and the environments seem plausible and doable with enough research, there are no \"magic wands\" or \"deus ex machines\". It's nice to see a grounded sci-fi every once in a while. The sounds and the music is pretty unremarkable but serves it's purpose.\nAll I can say is, that I'm eager for more, and I'll be waiting for the second season. I'm very intrigued as to where this story will go...\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=35,   ["text"]="                          \n    In short, \"Psycho Pass\" is a weak, pretentious and utterly misguided show. There are two main reasons for that. First - very general failure of the show in constructing a sensible futuristic vision and second - its not exactly superb writing.\nAt first Psycho-Pass looks like a clinical example of a generic work. It rips off \"Minority Report\", \"Dredd\" and many other SF stories. It has generic dystopian setting, generic art style, generic soundtrack - neither of these special nor particularly bad. Just not very promising. But then the basic premise of the story degenerates quickly. Decent dystopias in fiction generally should be at least marginally\n          \n        plausible and even if they are extremely bad place to live in it should be shown that they benefit at least some individuals in some way. Or at least it should be revealed gradually that they are nightmarish, nightmares being hidden behind idyllic appearances.\nIgnoring that, Psycho Pass from the very beginning presents its world as pure hell on earth. It is a close relative to Nazi Germany, apartheid South Africa and Stalin's USSR. After realizing it I counted on some in-story justification which would make me believe that this world (overseen by computer algorithm called Sibil System), evil as it is, has any sense. None was provided. The citizens of this world have absolutely no reason to endure living in such place. There isn't even any privileged caste who benefits from the system and there is no overwhelming force which keeps everyone in check. Literally nothing holds the system together. In any even marginally realistic scenario it wouldn't stand a chance of going on for longer than a month without big social turmoil and bloody rebellions on a massive scale. \nAnd it should be apparent not only from the outside perspective, to the viewer, but, inside the fictional universe, also to the characters themselves. In fact the entire cast of protagonists not only should notice on rational and political level how evil is the system they are protecting - the story gives them also every emotional, ethical and psychological reason one can think of to openly rebel. Yet they don't, they choose to back up the system instead. Which makes them automatically unconditional villains. And simultaneously complete morons, their choices and actions are so thoughtless and harmful to themselves it's almost beyond belief. It's also the reason why one loses all interest in their fate and in their fight against so called crime.\nThen we meet an antagonist. For a change, he rebels against the system. By being a psychopathic murderer with a higher goal. As a result he is moron as well - many of his actions are done only for the fun of bloody carnage and are actually harmful to his ultimate plan. Although he is better and a little bit more relatable character than protagonists, still in the end the whole story is about moron villains fighting other moron villains. I simply could not care less.\nAll of that alone wouldn't sanction such a bad rating. But, as I mentioned, on top of that the show was really badly written. Some characters are portrayed inconsistently - our main male protagonist oscillates between an apathetic cynical criminal, hunter obsessed with only one goal and sympathetic obedient detective entirely on the whim, without any justification given by the story. Causes of his intense hatred of main antagonist are also left unexplained, as are many reasons for his actions. Similar applies to main heroine, but because she is a rookie, it's justifiable to some extent by character development. The relationships in the hierarchical environment of police force are portrayed equally incoherently - the superiors and inferiors interact with each other from scene to scene so randomly one gets the impression writers haven't thought it out at all. The show has many underdeveloped characters and plots which looked promising, were played with but were ultimately abandoned in favor of the main story. There are some twists and climaxes later on, but they are unconvincing or fail to incite any emotional reaction. The latter is actually inevitable when you have unrelatable characters. Oh, and the series' lackluster ending is a sequel hook.\nThe other glaring flaw of the show is its frequent violation of the \"show, don't tell\" rule. It spends  enormous amount of time on explaining to the audience what exactly is going on, on delivering pompous speeches on philosophical topics and on quoting famous works, does it have a sense or not. \"Psycho-Pass\" insults the viewer with its explanations so many times that at some point it even begins to be funny. \nAnother problem arises every time when show tries to be insightful. The writers are trying to discuss serious issues, but everything they achieve is scratching the surface of the problem. The aforementioned pompous speeches are pretentious, shallow and often without actual content. It also looks like writers couldn't decide what exactly they want to discuss, they often raise an issue and then  almost immediately forget about it.\nNevertheless I hesitate to call \"Psycho Pass\" a complete shit. It really tried hard to be non-trivial, mature and thoughtful. It tried so much that although I really didn't like the show I finished it anyway.  Unfortunately all of its strengths lay in its potential, actual execution is a miserable failure. All what is left for the viewers is to hope that Gen Urobuchi will write some day as good story as he once did.\n        "},

Such is a world governed by the Sibyl system. \nI have rated this series 9 before and after rewatching the new edited version I give it 10, simply because the extra scenes are very important and add great context to other scenes and flesh out characters better.\nPsycho-pass is a crime fiction thriller whose idea is highly influenced by Philip Dick's \"Minority Report\" book series. Now despite the basic plot, this series is full of implications and hints. The writer does not give you what you want on a silver plate, he\n          \n        does not let you see what's truly going on, he wants you to see it and comprehend it on your own. \nThis is a very complex show, but where does this complexity lie and how do you find it?\nThe staggering point is that in a cyberpunk futuristic anime, what is most emphasized here is the hatred for technology. Technology stripped the world of meaning, stripped the world of values, stripped the world of genuinity, originality,creativity. Humans lost the motives to seek their most cherished ideals, purpose.. freedom.. truth. This is the most important concept that is implied within the show.. It's not about applying justice and eliminating crime as most people might think, it's about the foundation of human nature.\nAnother important argument is the free will debate, this illustrates our misapprehensions about ourselves; \nWhat are we after all if we don't act on our will, what is our worth, are we still human individuals, or are we then sheep within the herd..?\nAre you still authentic if you don't act from your own center? \nNow i know this might sound like I'm throwing all Makishima's thoughts onto the writer himself.. But as i see it.. I would say Makishima is Urobuchi's mouthpiece in Psycho-pass. The complexity and uniqueness of Makishima's character demands a great devotion in thought and effort.. Most of the episodes in the uncut version starts and ends with Makishima's words..\nAnother main character is Kougami Shinya.. He is the ultimate badass of the show but he's no hero. Kougami has a sense of justice but does not believe that the law is just, and thus he wants to act on his own to conquer evil.. Yet somehow, deep down, he doesn't think Makishima is evil.. deep down he knows how right Makishima is even if he doesn't agree with the latter's ways. He knows how similar they both are, no matter how much he denies it on the outside.. \nKougami's strength is \"anachronistic and classical\". He is far more deep than the abyss he eternally gazes into..\nI want to point out one other thing.. why the main female character who \"supposingly\" the story revolves around, acts in certain ways throughout the series, is because of her character not a plot flaw.. In the beginning she behaves like an inexperienced little girl because her character is an inexperienced little girl. although she undergoes a good amount of transformation, she still makes mistakes based on poor judgement and concrete idealism. Nonetheless I think she's very relatable and honest.\nI find the characters well balanced and interesting. The gore isn’t gratuitously silly and serves as an excellent plot device. Both the OST and voice acting are amazing.\nAll in all I think Psycho-pass is an outstanding anime because it delivers so many expensive thoughts and concepts and still leaves room for more thought. This anime is both a serious work of thoughtful art and a wild entertainment."},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=25,   ["text"]="                          \n    Criminals who babble philosophically will always be present in fiction. It’s an acknowledgement that mere sadism isn’t enough. Even if a person is a sadist, there is more going on than plain cruelty there. If we can answer what makes a man start fires, maybe we won’t need fire extinguishers. Too often these stories are too fascinated with the idea of the underdog taking revenge at society. He may lose, but awareness that he’s wrong doesn’t make it any less of an escapist fantasy.\nThe person’s actions should follow his worldview. If they contradict that, then this contradiction must be addressed. People are messy so of\n          \n        course they will contradict themselves. If they do so in the story, it’s because the author made it so. If he made it so, he needs to connect it. Don’t put contradictions where they don’t belong. People don’t always contradict themselves.\nThere’s a scene where Makishima gets into a fight and we see he’s a professional. It’s like before he went to star in Psycho-Pass, he stopped at Naruto and learned the ways of the ninja. I was supposed to be impressed, though. Not only is Makishima pretty and can predict people’s actions, he’s a champion at MMA.\nIt’s hilarious. It reminded me how Lisbeth solve an equation in the middle of the climatic fight. It’s so easy to give your character skills. You just look up the cheat codes, write the lines that say “add 50 points to Melee Skill” and you’re done.\nJust because your character is skilled at a lot of things doesn’t mean the author is skilled. Character skills are often substitutes for personality. Makishima is your stereotypical Pseudo-Philosophical Villain. Forget about how the series quotes a lot of books. None of Makishima’s speeches are related to his actions.\nAll of his actions involve death and destruction. He gives people who want to hurt others the means to do so. When Makishima does something of his own, it’s also to cause hurt. The dominating theme is hurting others. He gives them the freedom to hurt others, but that’s as far as it goes.\nFor freedom to be a theme, it needs to be expressed in different ways. The only freedom people gain is to hurt others. The violence is more varied. The characters include a bullied man, a girl sucked in her art and a person who loves the thrill of the hunt.\nMakishima is not very differernt from the Jigsaw Killer. Despite talking about appreciating life, his traps were so dangerous (some can’t be complete without somebody dying) that it’s obvious he doesn’t value these people’s lives. Makishima babbles about freedom and the prison of the Sybil System, but he’s fine with killing an innocent person. There’s no worse way of ripping freedom from someone than killing them.\nIt’s all shock value without substance. The result is entertaining at first, but goes downhill fast. The anime goes south when it expected me to stare at a helpless, half-naked woman begging for mercy and take the villain seriously. It’s not dark, because true darkness is understandable. A villain whose motives we can comprehand and find reasonable is scarier.\nIf Makishima tells people to live free or die, how much of a choice is it?\nWhat a shame. The series never chose whether it was a thoughtful story or a wild, exciting one. Either of these would’ve been fine. Being pretentious is the valley between the two.\nThe other side of the horseshoe fares better. The Sybil System is questioned, but it never becomes a strawman. The System is totalitarian, but it’s not an evil regime bent on oppressing everyone so the protagonist will have something to fight. Every system of government comes to power because it benefits someone.\nThe System doesn’t just benefit the Rich & Powerful. It benefits the simple people. The society has order, but it’s good order that leaves a lot of room for joy and wonder. Creativity may be restricted, but creativity isn’t everything. The artist may want to draw violence and the rocker wants to tell everyone to fuck off. Some would prefer to have a steady job and enough money to go for drinks with their friends.\nThe System also presents an alternative moral system to current society. We live in a society that praises people for getting money, having a lot of sex and being physically fit. Somehow all these promises of sex and money don’t prevent the high rates of suicide. So Sybil is not very friendly towards outcasts and has less room for creativity, but what if it’s a price worth paying for mental health?\nIt’s a society where you see advertisements for ways to improve your mental health. Everyone is talking about their Hue and Psycho-Pass. If you think this is going too far, then take a look at our own society. We do the same only for physical health. Physical health is a giant industry of protein shakes, gyms and promises of social status.\nNo system exists without its outcasts, and Sybil has its own. Only how it casts out people isn’t so different than ours. We rage against models who aren’t stick-thin, as if being fat is a moral offense. Later, we’ll hang out with sexual harassers just because they’re charismatic. Sybil is harsh to the mentally ill, but forgets about the actions.\nFor a    series where mental health is a big issue, it’s surprising how lacking it is in character development. A flashback tries to develop one character. All it tells us is that she used to play guitar. Why did she take a different road than her friend? Why are their worldviews so different?\nAkane gets some development, but she’s an archetype they play with rather than a psychological portrait. Ginoza is slightly better, but everyone else spits exposition without modifying it. There’s a wild card, a bisexual analyst, a cliched noir dude who remains tough and an old geezer. Their personalities clash more than your average detective story, but there aren’t even hints towards a psychology they didn’t have time to develop.\nPsycho-Pass has interesting ideas and a pretty fun story, but it has Makishima. It’s a pin in the tire that let all the air out. The ideas are too undeveloped and there aren’t enough of them to make up for this. It’s not a case of a series that’s too short, but a series that focuses on the less interesting parts.\n3 dominators out of 5\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=38,   ["text"]="                          \n    I'm gonna keep this brief: Watch this series. Fortunately I wasn't someone who started watching the show when it first aired, because goddamn, the hype and cliffhangers from episode to episode would have driven me crazy. Anyways, if I need to justify why this series is very good, here ya go. \nSTORY: Set in a futuristic city, 99 years in the future, the mental health of citizens can now be measured through Psycho-Pass, where it can be quantified. High Psycho-Pass means you're more likely to commit crime, low Psycho-Pass means the latter. Something that pleasantly surprised me was that the series deals with morals and\n          \n        philosophy quite a bit, it really felt well geared for the kind of show it is. The Sybil System which is an AI that looks over the Psycho-Pass of everyone in the country is a particularly interesting side of the exploration in the story. Great story. \nART: The art was very good in my opinion. The city looks very beautiful, and the character designs, while not being ground breaking, were very well designed. The series takes a lot of good scenery changes which was welcome, as you can only awe at a blue and black city for so long. You can definitely tell that the budget was well spent. \nSOUND: First things first, I goddamn love both of the openings and both of the endings. They were all truly kickass. The in-show music however, never really captured me the same way though. It served it's purpose though, and I thought the inclusion of classical tracks was refreshing. Good stuff overall, but lacked that extra push. \nCHARACTER: The two MC's of the show are Akane Tsunemori and Shinya Kogami. Their personalities and views differ a lot, but they really develop into a great team. I liked that there was no shoehorned romance between them, because it would've been pretty easy to do. With supporting characters, you've got Ginoza Nobuchika and Masaoka Tomomi along with several others, but out of the supporting cast, those two were my favorite. The antagonist of the series is Shogo Makishima, who for the record is very, very interesting. Sadly, telling you why would be spoiler heavy, but he serves a awesome role. I loved the characters of this show. \nENJOYMENT: I was on the edge of my seat every episode, and I can't say that about a lot of shows I've watched. It was a great ride, and it's not over yet with Season 2 in the works, which I'm very excited for.\nOVERALL: Watch this show. It was so much fun to watch, and made me think. The action was never just to be there, and the exposition was well paced. Hell, the whole show was well paced. You're missing out if you skip this one.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=34,   ["text"]="                          \n    “This is a disease called serenity...a form of death that people wished for.”\nA world that keeps people under control breeds monsters, in order to keep an equilibrium. Psycho-Pass could have been just another action anime with a cute main girl and attractive bishonen cast, fortunately, that wasn't the case. I would describe this anime as having an unique approach on a detective/ futuristic setting, borrowing a variety of concepts from various medias and forming its own world.\nIn a world dependent on technology, which seems so guarded and secure, the human psyche has never been more endangered. This world is marked by the existence of the\n          \n        “Sybil System”  (that is unquestioned by the avearge citizen, thus making you doubt the fairness of the system) which was a system created to improve the human society, by sorting out those who have a \"clouded Psycho-Pass\", (which means they have criminal tendecies) from the \"good sheep\". “Mental contamination” is presenting itself as a big issue, coordinating  the future of its inhabitants. The degree of how \"contaminted\" is your psychic health, is being measured by  the \"Psycho-Pass\" device, hence the name of the show.  This is a world where  humans chose comodity over personal freedom, which is only a very well camouflaged illusion. \nThe screen play was written by Gen Urobuchi (Nitroplus), the one and only creator of the thought-provoking Madoka Magica, he's the reason for the popular themes that attracts the masses while still delivering intriguing and imaginative themes. The first episode opens with the newly appointed young inspector Akane  Tsunemori that has as her first case the dangerous mission of catching a criminal. As her \"assistants\" she receives in her care a few \"enforcers\" who are described as latent criminals who are allowed into the outside world with the sole purpose of flushing out criminals just like themselves : \"They are hunting dogs. They're beasts used to hunt other beasts.\" At first, Akane is intimidated by them, but soon finds out they are victims of the society they live in. They are seen using cool-looking weapons, called “Dominator\" that adapt to the owner's psychological data, which in my opinion is an ingenious concept.\nI should add that action-driven, detective-oriented animes aren't my cup of tea (with the exception of Detective Conan, but that anime has less action and more analytical thinking), but in Psycho-Pass' case it is more than that, I was compelled by the waving of the plot and the philosophical aspects. They are smartly integrated in the plot, such as the existence of a dystopian future, how far can we grasp the mysteries of the human psyche, the thin line between right or wrong, the purpose of justice and law, the human need for comodity, which empties the human potential etc. Another strong point of the series is its social commentaries, using themes such as inequality in the society, fear of confronting reality by immersing yourself in the internet world, the existence of numbness and insensitivity of humans to stimulations since their reason of living had died out, as well as the opposite, people who want to outlive others by resolving to turn into androids. There are concepts borrowed from all over the place, from the science fiction novel \" Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" by Philip K. Dick (which is also mentioned by Makishima Shougo,the literature-loving killer), to George Orwell's famous \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" to William Gibson's cyber-punk universe.\nThere is a particular scene that I think is very relevant to understanding the degree of how the existence of the Sibyl System and Psycho-Pass affected the society: A man walks in a crowded street and randomly chooses to attack a woman, cowering in fear of the consequence of having their psycho-pass be clouded, the audience watches apathetically as the woman is being hit numerous times with a hammer/ gavel while being undressed. As if it weren't enough, the spectators even film the scene, seeming to enjoy it tremendously. Approaching her, comes a robot that advises her to go see a doctor, since her psycho-pass is clouded (due to the beating). This scene shows  the irony of the society they live in, on the surface the government pretends that they guard the citizens, but when something like this occurs, no one interferes  A character commented:“They said they couldn't understand what was going on. Someone being killed right in front of you,the idea wouldn't even occur to you. All these people lived up until today without even considering that something like this could happen”.\nThere are flaws with the plot which is pretentious and it does have an intellectual approach, however, it does not always succeed in actually being that, having more of a superficial \"intellectual feel\" to it. The anime has good flow until episode 11, after that it begins to be unfocused and starts prolonging unnecessarry story lines (however in the final episodes it returns to the original formula).   It is ironic that the best part of the story was the beginning which didn't have so much plot, but managed to maintain its good points, the episodic villains not slowing the plot but preparing it for the climax.\nIf you watched series such as Ergo Proxy and Ghost in the shell you may not find the story so innovative. However, if you haven't watched these great shows you'll be able to enjoy the story more than I did.\nStory: 7\nI have to say, the first thing I noticed looking on this anime's Mal page, was the design of the characters, I was like :\"Are you sure Amano Akira-sensei that did Katekyo Hitman Reborn didn't drew the characters?\" And I was right, you can't believe how happy I was since her drawing style is one of my favorites in manga. The art is very good, the designs for the characters are appealing and eye-pleasing, the scenaries are beautifully drawn and give the feeling the staff put a lot of effort and care into them, as well as in the technological devices. The animation is smooth and it flows naturally, giving a feeling of realism, while still keeping an anime feel to it.\nArt: 8\nThe sound is great, it has catchy rhythms and lyrics as well as atmospheric backgroud music.I remember a certain lyric  from the ending song \"God....Where did you go?\", which I think suits this society.\nSound: 8\nThe characters are likeable, even the main antagonist. At first, I thought Shinya Kougami  was a suicidal maniac, that seeked redemption by being killed. However, that's far from the truth, the audience discovering that he actually wants to live in order to avenge his murdered colleague. I find Shinya's character easy to empathise with (which is always a good thing), he is also interesting as a character, possesing superior observational skills which remind me of Will Graham from Red Dragon, who tries to enter the minds of criminals (at one point we see him reading a book called \"Heart of Darkness\", which presents the exact same situation he finds himself in, a conflict between the \"lower\", un-advanced humans and superior, technology-users ones).\n Akane's physical appearance makes her seem younger than she is, but her personality is far more reserved and mature. She is at one time regarded as “mental beauty” because of the degree of her self-control. One character stated about her that: “She accepts things as they are. She forgives society, acknowledges it, and accepts it. On top of that, she doesn't mind taking risks, so it's not like she's just going with the flow”. However, her relationship with Shinya is almost non-existent even after 20 episodes, which really annoys the hell out of me. \nNow, time for the most interesting character in this series, and the reason why this anime is so higly regarded, Makishima Shougo. In a world that humans aren't actually “alive”, as their lives are dictated by the Sybil System, Shougo wants to live life to the fullest. When people are given free hand to commit atrocious murders, they don't hesitate and grasp the chance. This is what Makishima really is in my opinion, a trigger that determines other people to go against the norms of society, fulfilling their destructive desires. He uses his natural leader skills to manipulate other criminals, being like a flame that attracts moths, ending up burning them, him being the only one left standing. His superior talents make him search for his equal, someone he can measure up against without ever getting bored. He represents the ultimate contradiction, his consciousness being crystal-clear and pure while committing heinous acts. He thinks of himself more of an artist than anything, a conductor that orchestrates the destruction of the world he lives in. There is beauty where there is suffering and chaos, only that way humans realise the importance of being alive. The exchange of words  he has with Shinya adds to my enjoyment, as I can clearly see the chemistry between the two characters, each being the reflection of the other, the only thing that separtes them is the side of the coin they are on.\nNobuchika Ginoza is one of these characters you either love or hate. It is interesting to see his inner conflicts, having to choose between obeying the system or aiding his friends. I find intriguing the fact that he strives to be the perfect inspector, since his own father failed as an inspector and became a latent criminal, disgracing his family. His fear of not wanting to became a latent criminal like his father is smartly crafted, though I would have enjoyed to see more of their relationship. There is also the tensionate realationship with Shinya, his former collegue and friend, who betrayed him like his father did, becoming a latent criminal, and for that, Ginoza never forgives him.\nHowever there are flaws with the characters as well. Even if Akane is the main character I would have liked to see more of her, the amount of information we receive about her is unsatisfactory. That doesn't only happen with her, but with Shinya as well, since we don't know anything about his background other than that he was an inspector. \nCharacters: 7\nThis anime is worth watching, it does deserve some of the praise it gets, even if it had its flaws. It is however one of the most well-made anime in the winter-spring season of 2013. I will end quoting Makishima, 'cause I liked it a lot: \" Just like God? That might be pleasurable in its own way, but unfortunately I'm not into umpire or referee, as I can't genuinely enjoy the game if I were one”.\nEnjoyment: 8\nOverall: 8\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=34,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    In our modern world, society is essentially the dictator of all law and judgement. A justice system, in reality, is merely a representation of what we as a society believe is \"right\" or \"wrong\". People who step outside this box, are often penalized - at the most extreme point, we refer to these people as criminals.\nObviously, the justice system today, has it's flaws. It's not uncommon to see innocent men and women being framed for crimes they commit - our judgment is not perfect.\nBut what if we could determine instantly, the criminals of the future, predetermining criminals before they commit their crime? Would such a\n          \n        system be deemed as \"perfect\"?\nSuch a question is something that I absolutely love when posed by an anime - a question or idea that challenges the foundations of our society itself, and challenges it's viewers to ponder upon the question it beholds before them.\nPsycho-Pass, essentially bestows such a question upon it's viewers - it poses them with an impossible society - one that possesses instant judgement of criminals prior to their crime, and then explores that system's flaws, asking the viewer to think for themselves what is best. The system itself, is referred to as the Sibyl System, a judgement system capable of placing a number on an individual's criminality, or as the anime calls it, their \"crime coefficient\". People are then punished not based on their crime, or their motifs, but rather, on their crime coefficient. Such a system is quite efficient - \"judgment\" comes in the form of a gun aptly named the \"Dominator\", and based on their coefficient, an individual can be instantly eliminated, or alternatively, paralyzed and dealt with later. This, is the center of Psycho-Pass's setting - a futuristic, dystopian cyberpunk Japan, where everything, including job aptitude, is determined through the Sibyl System.\nThis, is the setting for the anime - a dystopian Japan in which criminals are instantly judged and prosecuted, and from this, comes the amazing storyline that I found myself so indulged in. I absolutely love the idea of a non-white and black storyline - it makes for such a more interesting story, and allows for viewers to be varied in their position regarding the storyline. At an extreme extent, Psycho-Pass really doesn't have protagonists, nor does it really have antagonists, at least in the general sense. Rather, it has what I'd call \"perspectives\", different views upon a centralized topic, with both sides possessing conflicting views. Like I said, this is really what makes the story shine - a story that is in fact, not black and white.\nPersonally, however, what made the storyline so stunning for me was it's implementation of sociology. Like I said, it doesn't just place a black and white situation and portray it through multiple battle scenes, or random storyline elements that don't really make sense, it really asks the viewer a question, one that they can not only apply to the series itself, but to their own lives, and our own so treasured society. Like Serial Experiments Lain, it really challenges our beliefs in our society, and for me, strengthens my ideas of the flaws in our current general justice system. Ironically enough, Psycho-Pass's implementation is done mostly by what could be seen as the antagonist, further adding to my point that Psycho-Pass is not white and black at all. A lot of Psycho-Pass's references to sociology also recognize various authors who have written about society - George Orwell and his 1984, a novel which contained a society with many parallels with the society represented in Psycho-Pass, is referenced a few times, as are the works of Marcel Proust, Phillip K Dick (I'm sure the entire series was based on his short story The Minority Report, actually), and Jonathan Swift and his Gulliver's Travels. This, like Serial Experiments Lain, is a series in which it is possible to write an academic paper on. Psycho-Pass itself is almost like an academic paper, it poses a question, a thesis, and arguments to support it.\nOf course, a storyline is nothing without it's characters, and this is another place where Psycho-Pass does relatively well. At first, it seemed like Akane wasn't quite fit to be a protagonist of the story, but I know that for myself, I was very satisfied with the role that she played and the development that went into her character. She was very well realized. Actually, come to think of it, every single character was very well realized, there wasn't a useless half-assed character in sight. Naturally, Psycho-Pass does have characters that play a minor role, but come on, which anime doesn't? Obviously, the minor characters are not really the ones I'm trying to praise here, it's the main roles that really shine in Psycho-Pass. There is a cohesiveness in the relationships between characters in Psycho-Pass that simply gives value and meaning to every single character - the storyline benefits from this, as the majority of characters not only add depth to the storyline, but also meaning, and gives the viewers something to attach and relate themselves to. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that Psycho-Pass makes really good use of it's cast, and proves to be able to utilize them to develop it's already-excellent plot. One thing that struck out to me was that it wasn't only the protagonists that I agonized over. I agonized over every single character, they were all so well played out that I didn't find myself disliking any of the characters.\nAs with any anime, Psycho-Pass suffers from at least some form of minimal flaw, and in this case, it's the animation. It was good, yes, but this is one area where Psycho-Pass could be much better. I know that to some people, this would seem really picky of me to dissect and criticize Psycho-Pass to such an extent, however, I'm sure that I'm not alone. What I'm speaking of here is quite literally the animation. There were some instances where the animation was slightly choppy, and not quite as fluid as I would have liked. Granted, such a flaw is definitely acceptable, because right now, we've only got the aired TV release, I'm sure the animation will improve greatly once the Blu-Ray release comes out. Even if a BD release doesn't come out, the occasionally choppy and slightly derpy animation doesn't really deduct from the anime at all. The characters are still pretty well drawn, and stylistically, the animation gives a nice feel to the anime that really matches both it's setting and plot.\nOne thing that I truly found enjoyable for myself, was the opening and ending themes. Not only were the songs chosen very fitting stylistically, they were also very fitting in meaning. If you read the lyrics to the first opening, I'm sure you'll see some parallels between the meaning of the song, and the anime itself. Personally, if I were to dissect any aspect of Psycho-Pass's choice of music, it would have to be the final ending. I know I found myself enjoying the final ending theme, however, I also know that it's a fact that the song is definitely a \"love it or hate it\" kind of thing. Some would argue that it's not very fitting for the anime, and I'd agree with them, stylistically, it doesn't really fit. It's not like it's a bad song, it just doesn't fit like the rest of the OST does. On the other hand, it's a pretty good song, and even if it doesn't fit, I don't think I ever found myself skipping the ending theme.\nThe actual sound, as in background noises, I suppose, was also pretty good. All the background sounds felt in place, and had a sense of realism to it. Never once during the anime did I find myself noticing either a serious lacking in the background sound's realism and presence. It seemed to be pretty well thought out. The BGM at some points also proved to be very fitting to the scene itself - a lot of the more epic scenes are augmented by their respective BGM's. It gives a bigger feel of suspense.\nI know for a fact that this anime was well-received. I also know that sometimes, animes that bask in the light of critical acclaim, aren't really deserving of such acclaim. Psycho-Pass, is not one of these animes. I for one, truly believe that Psycho-Pass has earned it's right to it's critical acclaim - it really was a great anime. And I'm sure I'm not alone in believing so.\n~ Note ~\nIf you, the reader, ever find anything in my review that you would like to revoke, or anything that you either just don't agree with, or maybe just have another opinion on something I said, please, by all means, drop me a comment or a message, criticism is definitely welcome, and if you just want to have a chat, by all means, that's very welcome too. If you're going to deem this review \"Not helpful\", it would be really helpful, for me, if you told me why, so that I may be more helpful the next time around. Otherwise you're basically thumbing down my review just 'cause.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=32,   ["text"]="                          \n    I was really, really irritated and upset, when I had watched the first episode. For all those around who have the same hate for whacky characters - brace yourself and you will be rewarded. Believe me.\nStarting with anime itself. I really feel like writing a review on two titles (both sequel and this one) could be an option, but I still see them as a collective entity. Thus, my opinion is based on watching both seasons. The only thing I can say about them now - they have the similar idea, but take a different approach on expressing it.\nPsycho-Pass has it's own unic way of\n          \n        showing the society, which is ruled by Sybil System - the ultimate and perfect (but not completely) judge, who dictates the law and makes the accusation and the same time. The ones who serve justice and find the guilty ones, however, are still humans. This 'human factor' sometimes leads to unexpected incidents such as the one in that notorious first episode, where Acane makes a debut appearance.\nI personally think she is not the brightest and best character in this show, but I felt sympathy for her own way of dealing with criminals. She protests about killing humans, knows the value of life and tries to do everything the peaceful way, if possible. I could really tell that she had improved quite a lot throught the show and dumped some of the annoying features of her character. \nSlowly making our way to Kougami and Makishima. They are both quite similar in their judgement and views, which makes them feel obsessed with each otherat the end. Kougami wants to fully understand Makishima, Makishima finds a perfect rival for himself, fair enough. \nKougami is brutal, manly and suited for the job of the enforcer, but he also has outstanding abilities as a detective, which made me admire him quite a bit.\nThe one thing that made me love this show was, in fact, a genius antagonist. Makishima is not the same as all those typical 'all-around evil' guys, who just hurrdurr at everyone, built towers and try to capture the world, failing at the end. You can clearly see Shougo's motives, and I can even say, that I'd feel the same urge to cast down the system as he did. He seems to somewhat enjoy killing people, but does it mainly to find the flaws in Sibyl's judgement. ...I was really amused when he refered to Orwell and Dick and said, that \"e-books lack characters\" too. \nThe second season also has a unic antagonist, who wants to shake the society and judge the entire system, but his is more, how do you say it, middle-classed and normal. He still has amazing knowledge in some aspects, but is more about empathy and revenge. No quotes from Shakespeare either.\nOther characters were mainly to fill the plot, but they are very well-written too, especially Ginoza, which comes a loong way from an annoying wonnabe-dictator to a caring and tolerant person.\nThe other good point of the show is it's unbelievable atmosphere. The first season is more about  bright colors and showing the life of suburbans becoming really dark and even scary when it wants to, which may shock some people that don't expect such gorgeous contrast. There were some amazingly well-made scenes of hysteria not only amongst individuals, but also amongst the citizens, which made me freeze on spot and just watch things happen with an open mouth.\nThe second season, however, is dark from the beginning, all the more messy and violent, so you quickly get used to it (if you ever can). \nOpenings and endings of both seasons represent not only the overall attitude of shows, but the state of mind of main characters too. \nOverall, I enjoyed Psycho-Pass a lot and even digged some information about the show's plot in order to understand some motives and events. The show has left some matters to think of and discuss, so I consider it a good aftertaste.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=32,   ["text"]="                          \n    The series is set in a not so distant future. In a state which can definitely be seen as a satire of a modern utopia. What maintains the peace is a system where you can instantaneously measure an individual’s state of mind. If the person turns out to be emotionally unstable, the unit will immediately be apprehended. If it turns out the individual is suffering a too grave of a mental instability and therefore be out of reach salvaging, the system will instead discard the threat.\nIt goes without saying this is a society where humanistic ideals are by long time buried deep into the ground\n          \n        where they cannot disturb a more effective regulation of humanity. A ruling which has much in common with pristine societies, where the contemplation is nothing for the giant mass. A philosophy which often is condemned for bringing stalemate to the global progression. Which of course is no surprise, it doesn’t take much thought to realise what can go wrong with an almighty aristocracy. It’s like the darkness that once disappeared by the illumination of the enlightenment once again clouds our globe. This can also be seen by the flawed nature of the false safety the system brings. Humans are not seen as individuals but a unit with a syntax value. Which obviously is a very controversial state of relief.\nThis dark atmosphere is why the main character is such an interesting piece in this series. Somehow this human still has the ideals which humanity today holds so dear. The series therefore brings an inner battle between her ideals and the harsh reality, and it surely shows how rigid they contrast.\nThis setting and situation is obviously nothing new. One of the obvious correlations comes with Orwell, but that’s what makes this series enjoyable because it’s alluded to great literary works and philosophical conflicts. It’s nothing new but still a fascinating story.\n\nThe series also strengthens this theme by endowing things like violence, tragedy and despair. In a very anime like way. Which as well makes it more unique. It also makes itself enjoyable by providing a very contrasting antagonist which leads to more tension and philosophical dilemmas.\nAll this together has been weaved into a cloth of the finished product. I’m more than sure that you can enjoy this show without grasping all the aspects which the series contain. But I’m at the same time certain that you will enjoy it even more if you understand what the series Psycho-Pass really is."},

PLEASE STICK AROUND. THIS ONE'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE*\nIf you are an anime critic, then there's no doubt that you've encountered a work by Gen Urobuchi, and probably enjoyed it. It is no secret to any decent anime critic that he has made some rather dark works that have a lot of intrigue and\n          \n        badassery. It's also no secret that this show is very popular, even amongst adult or adolescent newcomers to the medium given its style, subject, and qulaity. This series is one of the most popular anime of the decade, so it's only fair that its popularity be earned by being good rather than just having a striking premise and then failing to capitalize on it or making good stories out of it (looking at you, SAO and Re:Zero). You might be wondering why I am praising this series right out the bat. Since I can't come up with a decent intro to this review minus what was at the very top, let's just skip the humor. With that said, as to the question posed right before that sentence, let's find out, shall we?\nSTORY: 8/10\nWe cut to Shinya Kogami and a masked dude fighting, resulting in an explosively gory fatality of the masked dude, allowing Shinya to keep moving until being confronted by a devilish mastermind. We then jump back to the location in which the chronological order of the story can start. This technique is one that I love. I love t when they can set up an important rivalry before showing you the true context about it and how everything leads back up to that moment. As for the rest of the show, it's holds up to the same caliber. The sci-fi world has just enough futuristic tech with enough plausibility so that I don't need to question it as it makes perfect sense within its own context and seems like tech they could actually exist later down the line. The story has some episodic cases and some small case arcs that all get progressively more tied to the ultimate plot of the series; that being, the Sibil System vs an un-readable psychopath who had orchestrated those past cases via the producer role rather than the director/maker of the crimes. We get to see believable developments of the characters as they get strung around the mastermind's finger while at the same time, getting a firm grasp on how he ticks. The cases themselves are mostly interesting and all lead up to the grand scheme of the series rather well. \nOnce that arc kicks in, all hell breaks loose as he unleashes a psycho-virus onto everyone by using masked dudes to push them over the limits of their individual sanities. We then divulge into the shock that this Sybil System which governs Japan is a collection of 247 criminally asymptomatic brains (meaning they have white Psyho Pass hues and crime coefficients (which are what determine if someone should be allowed to live)) and that it has dubious faults and ambitions that go against Akane's while she tried to manipulate it to bend to get will of trying to non-lethally stop Kogami from killing said mastermind while stopping said mastermind from destroying the Sybil System. It all culminates into an impressive finale they rivals the shocking episode 11 (which resulted in the death of Akane's friend) and the badass episode 16 (which resulted in the mastermind's initial capture before breaking out to continue his plan).\nCHARACTERS: 8/10\nInspector Akane Tsunamori is the franchise protagonist despite not being the defacto main lead in this series. She is rather sweet and diligent, and has a strong sense of justice and morality. She goes through some nice development. She is also a slow progression protagonist, aka, she pails in comparison to the competence of those she works with, but in seeing how they progress throughout the series in their journeys, she progresses as a character and as an experienced combatant so that it's all the more rewarding seeing her do something cool like blindsiding our resident mastermind which in turn, saves Kogami. Sucks what happened to her friend, Yuki. She did not deserve to die. Next, the season's ultimate main, Shinya Kogami. After a case gone gruesome, Kogami's crime coefficient went up to the point where he could no longer be an inspector and instead had to live an an enforcer, which is basically the attack dog to the master and detective known as the inspector. He is a bit stoic towards Akane and is generally levelheaded, but probably let's emotions overpower him the most out of anyone in the series. He is a badass as well who wants nothing more than to bring this mastermind down. \nSpeaking of the mastermind, it's about time I reveal his name, that being, Shougo Makishima. A character who is constantly conspired to Griffith from Berserk, rigit down to the Seyuu and hair color. He is a criminally asymptomatic anarchist who desires true freedom in life instead of living life in accordance to the Sybil System. He quotes famous literature from real life, and is a skilled manipulator and killer, who allowed many minor antagonists to commit crimes before he disposes of them.He is very entertaining to watch, and I really liked the moment when Kogami and the series's resident psychoanalyzer, Professor Saiga (albeit he doesn't like being called professor) try to visualize how Makishima would chime in with their conversation. \nThen, we have Inspector Ginoza; a no nonsense inspector who acts very stoic and almost aggressive to Akane at points, which gets more understandable given that his father and friend were both inspectors who's crime coefficients reached criminal levels, and that he doesn't want the same happening to Akane, despite that at the end of the series, he ends up in that situation himself due to the death of his father in the penultimate episode. Speaking of his father, Masaoka acts as a sort of relaxation figure for the group and the one that takes things down a notch when things within the group get too heated. Shion is their researcher that looks up valuable data to help them in their investigations. Yayoi is a more serious enforcer who at one point really liked this band who ended up trying to rebel against the Sybil System. It sucks they they don't really give her much time to shine, but it was inevitable that certain characters would get the shaft. Kagari is the most nonchalant of the group, and is one who has some moments in the spotlight, like when he takes down a bunch of masked dudes employed by Shougo and confronts his ultimate lackey, Choe Guseong, which caused them to find out the true form of the Sybil System and die shortly afterwards. It's safe to say they this was a pretty good cast, no matter how simple they might be, due to how effective they are.\nART: 9/10\nProduction I.G did a great job making this gritty, futuristic world feel vibrant, with its lighting and coloring that made even the dimmest of locations come to life vibrantly. The character models are also decent, if prone to occasional hiccups;most notably in the original airing of episodes 17 and 18. The action is well choreographed in the way they that it was generally a rough combat 1 on 1 sequence. The CGI was mostly well done too. It was still noticeable, but they usually managed to find a way to make it fit well with the asthetic of the series. Also, the OPs have very awesomely stylized looks to them. The EDs do a great job with the more techy side of things. The death scenes were almost always decisive, explosive, and dramatic, which made it all the more epic when one occurs via dominator. Also, the deadly robot attack dogs remind be of Blade Wolf from Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. The directing was great, with the dream team mentioned above really making everything flow well and feel lively despite how gritty everything was.\nSOUND: 8/10\nThe first OP \"Abnormalize\" done by Ling Tosite Sigure was awesome, and same applies to OP 2 \"Cause I Feel\" by Nothing's Carved In Stone. The first one is very dramatic to really make it feel like a noir in which time is everything otherwise something horrible will happen, while OP 2 was just very catchy. Both EDs were done by EGOIST, which should sell you on them right away. The first one was very cool. The second one, while I don't enjoy it as much as most of EGOIST's music, fits very well with many parts of the show's second half. The rest of the OST was ok, with some nice ones here and there. The dub was very good considering how unfamiliar everyone is to me. Then again, it's a Funimation dub, which usually means sits a better dub than most others, and the voices work rather well from what I got to hear in dub.\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\nI was very intrigued by Psycho Pass. It had gripping and gruesome scenes to make me feel like this was a badass show I was watching. It had great directing in terms of dialogue as well, making nothing feel forces and making it come off as pretty natural, which is surprising hard to do in anime. Episodes 11, 16, and 22 were the standout moments of the series for me, which is a rather common opinion from what I heard. It's no favorite of mine, but I had some real fun with this series. If was somewhat thought-provoking, and very entertaining from beginning to end, and the likable cast helped greatly with that.\nOVERALL: 8/10    RAW SCORE: 8.16/10\nSuch an interesting and great series this was. I feel as if I've run out of things to really say for this show, which usually happens at around this point anyway. Nonetheless, I look forward to seeing if this team of three will ever work together on another big project (aside from the Psycho Pass movie which I haven't seen). Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.\n        "},

Because they \"fill in\" with useless talks and useless episodes (like the first 8 episodes) and so they manage to make it bigger. It worked out? NO ! \nThe fist episode: Ah the plot is nice, i want to see more. \nAfter 7 eps: Oh come on but this never ends? I'm tired of it \nAfter 18 eps: Well at least\n          \n        they managed to pull of a nice twist. \nIn the end : Okay it's over, next.. \n\nStory: 8/10. The plot is .. well .. good. BUT, it's not well explored. They never explained anything. They just told us what it was and we had to accept it. That's it. No questions allowed. \nThis can be good or bad depending on the plot quality.. this one is not that great for it. \nWe have detectives, and they pull of some deductions as Sherlock does. The difference? While Sherlock explain how did he manage to figure that out.. here .. again no questions allowed. \"Oh you carry a weapon\" .. HOW THE FUCK YOU KNOW THAT JUST BY LOOKING AT HIM? They never explained. This happens all over the anime which just pissed me off. \nMaking these things it's no easy deal .. so i would prefer anything else rather than detectives with unquestionable deductions. \nArt: 8/10. It's fine .. the character design it's not my favourite but it's good. The background failed hardly on transmiting the idea of future. The action takes place in 2100 .. meanwhile japan looks like New York of now. Yeah .. \nSound: 8/10. First opening? Amazing. Second opening? What a shame .. please delete it from my mind. While the first one fits with the plot .. the second one i didn´t managed to conect it with the plot. \nThe OST are nothing memorable, but they are not bad. \nCharacter: 8/10. The main villian is awesome. Just an amazing character. Nice motivations, nice reasons .. i wish they eplore him better. \nThe other characters? Well .. not that great. They are not bad, but nothing new in terms of feelings.. i could guess what they were thinking and what they would do sometimes .. even though some actions got me surprised and that is something really enjoyable. \nEnjoyment: 7/10. A lot of useless shit throughout the show just made it boring. The end is nothing special.. the normal end. The plot twist? Was good but not enough to save this anime.  \nOverall: 7/10. If i reccomend this show? Kinda of .. there are betters for sure, but there are also worst. If you want to have some fun, you may like it more than i did.. but if you are looking for mindblowing plots with unpredictable characters .. don´t try this one. \n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="                          \n    A rather harsh assessment of Psycho Pass I’ve heard is that it’s a bad knockoff of Ghost in the Shell. While I liked and disliked them for different reasons, I found that Psycho Pass is more akin to a Philip K. Dick style story than William Gibson’s wild brand of cyberpunk. The show takes a more systematic sociological route in exploring the world rather than a technology-driven evolution like GITS does. However what really frustrating about the story is that it wants you to know that it has read these authors like an insecure teacher tossing you their resume at you as they look down\n          \n        and snicker. It’s references to Dick, Shakespeare, Orwell and Swift are confusingly placed to describe the story’s central pivot of Sybil, and instead of enlightening the references become more confusing and out of place. Psycho Pass has the opportunity to light up the world it builds with compelling characters and story premise, but relies too heavily on detective tropes and heavy handed philosophy discussions for it to feel like a story speaking on its own. Psycho Pass gets up to the stand and flips through some pages of a hastily written speech, spouting crisp images of psychobabble here and there. Then it walks off the stage in a huff and the characters backing it up remain sitting, rigid and voiceless.\nThe premise and how it's set up within the first couple of episodes is really solid. Akane along with the viewer are plunged pretty fast into a steel saturated technocracy.  It immerses you pretty quickly and that really impressed me about the first couple of episodes. This was the best part about the story as a whole. Every episode at the beginning of the first half are all pretty diverse and with Akane we find that there's way more of a messy society than the premise of a cop show generally explores. The location diversity was one of the more subtle ways of expressing the theme that the law is flawed without waving a textbook in our faces. Every setting, from Spooky Boogie's criticism chat rooms, far out factories with intentionally faulty machines, music bars occupied by resistance, and the hunting chamber at the end of the first half are the more subtle routes for exploring what I think the show wanted to say. Given the inhabitants that occupy these places sending Akane and everyone else into them was the perfect lens to explore the idea of escapism to indulge in mankind's most primitive or violent impulses. However the show goes pretty off the rails and gets more pretentious as soon as Makashima comes more clearly into view. When he shows up and his secret is revealed the intrigue of the show drops, and the characters become dolls getting pulled along by strings to the next location of shenanigans rather than active players bouncing off of each other as human beings and just more ways to say that the system is flawed. The script continually smacked my hand with a ruler, looking down to me over its glasses and asking me; do you get it? Sibyl is flawed, get it yet? Not yet? Now? Get it? It's flawed. Why? 'Cause it's flawed.\nThe art and sound while passable do their job and do it fairly well. Each location, as I mentioned before, while caked in boring steel warehouses, also tell that there's a diverse world to be had here. Set pieces are large and given the fact the show expresses how it's a big world with plenty of mystery  the set pieces are the best choice for the job aesthetically. The character designs too, while rather predictable, express subtle attributes of what's there from each character's personality. Kougami's messy but dons the police outfit because he's supposed to. Sure he looks like a Spike Spiegel knockoff but whatever. Makashima's white and pure, Akane is innocent but tightly wound, I'm sure you could find more but you get the character designs do as they're told and work. The music however I found rather underwhelming. Abnormalize I found to be the best track, frantic, layered with instruments and very catchy. However a sly guitar note here and there and instrumentals not more than white noise I found to be the entirety of the soundtrack. I know it's something small to bitch about, but music adds an extra layer of depth to the show, something Psycho-Pass needed. The second opening was fitting lyrically but underwhelming musically. The endings provided nice down time from all the action but I also found them lacking and didn't keep my interest enough to watch any of the credits. The aesthetics are layered yet not quite there in comparison to other shows in the genre, and even with it's different premise hinder it from standing out in the sci-fi police crowd.\nCharacterization was promising at first but ended up being the weakest part of the show for me. While the premise gives plenty of room for the characters to establish themselves and grow under Akane's pseudo-leadership, they end up being pulled from action scene or crime scene to the next and just figure out what's going on. It makes it feel like a paint by numbers cop show given what the plot does and the premise leaves so much to the imagination. Since it went for the sociological approach to reducing each person's state of mind to a number and a color, I was hoping that this was what the character struggles paired with the stress of the job would come from. But few of them barely change past their initial premise. Akane while the show wants to think she gets stronger, remains similar by the end. Kougami has more of a past than Makashima, but that's the only thing he cares about in the show. The characters do their job by moving the plot but given the opportunity they had to clash with each other, Sibyl, and their own introspection let me down. References to literary works explored what Psycho Pass wanted to say, but left the characters unmemorable and rigid, as they said little to nothing to contribute in their own voice.\nWhen it does good, it gets the aesthetics and establishes up front what it wants to do. But as a whole Psycho Pass is well, passable and could have been a way better show if it was given better writing TLC. It catches itself in a net of wanting to be more than just a police show, but doesn't tread carefully on the delicate ground of its heavy handed grey area it looks to explore.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="                          \n    Here's my quick review of Psycho Pass. \nDo you ever watch an anime and after the last episode is done you don't know what to do next with your life? Psycho Pass is one of those animes, so long story short, should you watch it? Yes. Most definitely YES. \nTo be honest it's been a while since an anime has roped me in enough to leave me with a uncontrollable urge to watch the next episode despite being 3am in the morning and having work the next day. Oh and you can quit comparing this to Death Note, besides both shows having anti-heroes, there is\n          \n        no similarity. Take Psycho Pass as it is and you'll be very impressed by the great storyline and several plot twists. The voice acting was great, I watched it in Sub however, the reason for this being is because there is a second season out and I didn't want to wait. There were times the voice acting was so good and so full of emotion I couldn't help but sympathise with the characters. Oh and speaking of the characters? Awesome. Granted there is a room for character development in some, however characters like Makishima Shogo leave an imprint in you even after the series. I would compare Makishima's genius, malice and performance close to the Joker in the Dark Knight. A puppet master to set the stage for anarchy. Brilliant. So in conclusion, in terms of enjoyment, this gets a massive thumbs up from me! I felt every episode contributed to the story, and if not the story, finding out more about the characters I was so eager to understand more.

I have come to know him more, and I can say that he is a writer full of hatred.\nAnd I can say that, Psycho-Pass is the most humane story of Urobuchi Gen.\nTaking place in a not far future, a dystopian place, Psycho-Pass is a great criticism to human nature itself, both as individuals and community. It is interesting to see that these matters were not put in a subtle way, but a more direct way. It's so unlike Urobuchi Gen, but that is one of the few reasons to\n          \n        make it his most humane story.\nSolitude... Being part of a community... Allegedly given freedom... A future that is sealed even before the act takes place. Everything is decided for you and yet you still live a life that is yours. However, what will happen when the walls that are protecting you fall part? And maybe worst? It makes you to question. Were they made to keep the danger outside, or were they made to keep you inside? What will be the side you'll be taking when those walls fade?\nCharacters of Psycho-Pass touches almost everyone's life. Almost everyone can find something related to themselves in them. Obsession, parenthood, patriotism, humanism, idealism, solitude, search,  a lesser evil, a greater good, an impossible choice, incomprehensible and unacceptable yet still undeniable facts... Nothing is up to you to decide, yet you have to make a choice. It is the very essence of Psycho-pass, desperation.\nEvery single character in this story suffers from it, and takes shape with it. It will be up to you to decide the good and evil... again.\nScience fiction, action, detective... These may be the genres to describe Psycho-Pass, and it may look like it only speaks for a very specific part of viewers, but not only it fills those genres quite well, but also it speaks for other viewers too. If you are looking for something that makes sense, that you'll both enjoy and question paradigms while watching, Psycho-Pass is something you should never miss.\n        "},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=26,   ["text"]="                          \n    Once in a while, there comes along an anime that claims to go against the industry's trend. An anime that claims to be unique in a time when the market is filled mostly with indistinguishable moe clones and so on. This is a very good marketing strategy for Psycho Pass if you ask me, especially given the gorgeous artwork and an exciting concept. In addition to this, it was touted as the 'next GITS'. Needless to say, I picked this up with VERY HIGH expectations.  expectations which were about to come crashing down faster than you could say 'psychopath'. \n\nLet me commence the review\n          \n        of this miserable, god forsaken creation by explaining with the use of as few swear words as possible, the stupidity of this anime's excuse for a plot. The story is convoluted and too pretentious for its own good. In short, its sort of like the sentence which began this paragraph. As I said before, the concept is exciting, thought provoking even. So it comes as a huge disappointment that, instead of analyzing the effects of such a system on society in an unbiased manner, this anime opts to make it seem altogether evil and oppressive. Just how ludicrous the system is can be understood by watching the first episode. We see a rape victim almost killed for..well, being raped. Why would anyone shoot at an innocent rape victim? Why is being passionate about something likely to make you a criminal? Why does such an oppressive system exist in the first place? Your guess is as good as mine because these and many more questions are never answered and are left to the imagination of the viewer. Instead, the show spends several minutes every episode explaining things that are totally obvious like how people are living with a false sense of security. Its almost as if Urobuchi didn't want to touch substantial questions about the setting with a ten foot pole. He seems to have the characters engage in needlessly long conversations about everything under the sun just to avoid discussing the aforementioned questions. But I suppose the stupidity of characters deserves a paragraph of its own. \nOne of the biggest draws for me in GITS is the characters. So, when they said this was going to be the 'next GITS', I was expecting a cool protagonist like Kusanagi. But instead of someone competent and emotionally mature like the Major, we get Akane. She is the exact opposite of what you would expect from a half-decent police officer. Even if she's newbie, expecting us to believe that someone in her position would burst into tears on a whim is nothing  short of insulting the intelligence of the viewer. The rest of the team is also inexplicably over emotional. These lunatics are like a rag-tag bunch of immature teenagers drawn from some high school drama rather than a well organized team of law keepers. Pretty much the same description applies to the antagonist, Makishima, who is apparently trying to expose the absurdity of relying on psycho passes. At least, that's what the anime wants you to believe. In actuality, he comes across as an emotionally challenged idiot who just uses people to amuse himself and cause destruction. What little character development there is occurs in sudden bursts and is the result of convenient writing than anything else. All in all, Psycho Pass fails spectacularly in this department as well. \nThis anime provides no food for thought to be sure. It does however, provide some awesome eye-candy. Production I.G has done an outstanding job of creating a detailed futuristic environment that fits the theme perfectly. The anime uses a wide array of colors to accurately convey the atmosphere in each scene. There are a few hiccups here and there, but these minor glitches are more than excusable given the overall visual quality. Character designs are similarly good looking. You will however come across a few shots in which characters look terrible, but these are far apart and pardonably few in number. \nI wish I could sing praises about the audio as well, but there is nothing that really stands out. Sure, the voice cast delivers aurally pleasing performances and Yugo Kanno delivers some catchy tunes. But on the whole, this department seems quite lackluster compared to the visuals. It is however, by no means, sub par.\npsycho Pass is an amalgam of the great and the abysmal. Unfortunately, it fails miserably in crucial areas such as plot and characters. So much so that not even the spectacular visuals can make up for it. In fact, its almost saddening that such stylistic visuals are wasted on telling a story which has neither substance nor a clear sense of direction. Characters who behave like emotionally challenged teenagers and lack any credible development only serve to mar an already horrible series. In the end, Psycho Pass doesn't do anything interesting with its unique premise and remains a frustratingly shallow experience throughout. I think I finally understand Urobuchi's nickname. He managed to butcher the series quite well. "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=26,   ["text"]="                          \n    Totally forgot I had this review.\nPlease don’t break out the pitchforks for not giving it a 10 and calling it the best thing since sliced bread either. \nStory: (7.5/10) \nSet approximately a century in the future, Tsunemori Akane is a rookie inspector for the MWPSB, the equivalent of Japan’s police force. Governed under a mysterious entity called the Sibyl System, which essentially quantifies your quality as a person, the world is set up using a seemingly typical dystopian model. Based on the background information given, it is implied that the Sibyl System is only present within Japan. The series does a rather good job explaining\n          \n        several nuances of the system, whether by showing through example or explaining through technobabble that, although seems ridiculous, is essential to any science fiction story (I will abbreviate SF for science fiction from now on). Most of the story focuses on Akane’s unit solving various cases that eventually begin to connect to one culprit, Makishima Shougo.\nNow onto the fun part.\nLike any respectable SF work, Psycho-Pass focuses on certain themes throughout the series. I believe scriptwriter Gen Urobuchi pinpointed his focus on one central theme: morality. What convinces me that this topic is the central focus is because our main character, Akane, is a walking goody two-shoes who blabs and argues about morals more than Tanabe Ai in Planetes. Although at face value, the show focuses on many other broad topics like governance, the value of life, and the dangers of future technology, each topic eventually boils down to the question: Is *insert topic here* right or wrong? The good part of Psycho-Pass’ story is that the series initially does a wonderful job of building a diverse and intriguing world, with the Sibyl System as its cornerstone; however, as the series progresses, the world becomes uninteresting as the initially complexly constructed Sibyl System takes a backseat to a melodramatic police drama that turns out to be much less interesting than the actual world itself. To top that off, the show also falls short in delivering another aspect that many people hail it for. \nThis aspect, of course, is the social commentary. \nFrom time to time, Psycho-Pass brings up some questions that might raise a few eyebrows; however, other than getting you thinking for the five-or-so minutes after the episode is over, the show doesn’t do much to develop these ideas. In fact, the manners in which said ideas are presented are not much more than references to other works of literature in the past. It would be acceptable if Urobuchi threw in a reference every now or then to help develop an idea, but instead he uses these obvious references to previous works as the only form to convey his messages. What results from this is a loss of identity. Because of these references, the show will probably not be remembered in the future as Psycho-Pass, but as “that show that tried too hard to be ‘deep’ (I kind of hate that word) by referencing obscure 17th century Japanese philosophy.” It’s this sort of referencing that suckers people into actually believing that Psycho-Pass is much more than it actually is. Moreover, since the show is essentially a police drama, the ongoing melodramatic development of the overall story hazes the impact of the supposed social commentary.\nOverall, the story of Psycho-Pass suffered from too many inconsistencies along with a lack of an actual identity to be considered to be the “amazing, thought-provoking, and mature” story that many people tout it to be. Instead, the story ends up being disappointingly typical, and it leaves a feeling that it could have been so much more.  \nArt: (9/10)\nOne worry I always have with the art style of any SF anime is the setting. The portrayal of a futuristic world is a feat that is very difficult in both anime and other mediums. Anyways, with Psycho-Pass, I was surprised to see how much detail Production IG took in building the world visually. From details as minute as the fact that the cars can drive themselves to something as important as the functionality of the dominator, the world is fleshed out very well thanks to the many episodes given to establish the setting. In other words, the society not only looks futuristic, but feels futuristic. \nWe are exposed to a variety of different locales from night clubs to government buildings, and the little nuances included in these scenes were very important in building a visually believable world. The animation was fluid and detailed, and lighting was done to give the show the dark ambiance that is characteristic of all Gen Urobuchi stories. My main gripe about the art style was the character designs. Some characters look plain awkward, and overall, they just don’t fit the setting. Although the cartoony design approach has worked in other shows like Monster, the character designs of Psycho-Pass were a bit over-the-top. \nSound: (9/10)\nThe OST of Psycho-Pass is strong. There is a wide variety of different tracks that express a vast array of emotions. From calmer piano ballads to adrenaline-pumping techno tunes, the viewer can tell that the soundtrack was constructed very well. Although I think soundtrack placement could have been better at parts of the series, the overall OST was very solid. Voice acting too was excellent. Even though the only standout performance I can point out to is Hanazawa Kana’s voice as Tsunemori Akane, the rest of the cast performed amiably with no performances I can really say were bad.\nAs a supercell fan, I was delighted to hear that Chelly would be performing both endings, Namae no Nai Kaibutsu and All Alone with You. The first ending was definitely among my favorites; not only did it fit the series well, but it was one of the catchiest songs I have ever listened to. In contrast, All Alone with You, although a very solid song, was definitely weaker than the first ending and did not fit well with the show at all. The same pattern can be found for the opening sequences. The first opening, Abnormalize by Ling Tosite Sugire, is an excellent and fitting opening. Unfortunately, the second opening, Out of Control by Nothing’s Carved in Stone, feels both generic and uninspiring. \nOverall, the sound set of Psycho-Pass, much like the art/animation, is excellent all around. Although there are still some flaws in certain subcategories, it is still very well done. \nCharacters: (7.5/10)\nThe main problem with SF works is that the creator often focuses so much on the actual setting of the show, that the characters ultimately fall flat. Like many other shows of the same genre, Psycho Pass is unable to break this predisposition to mediocrity; however, there is some hope. \nMost of the cast is pretty plain and I have long forgotten many of their names. Some are given minor development, while others end up being filler and are ultimately unnecessary to the show. There are three members of the cast worth mentioning, so I will give a brief and general rundown of each.\nTsunemori Akane: Without a doubt the best character in the show, Akane is a moralistic goody two-shoes whose ideals parallel that of the Sibyl system. A model citizen who graduated the top of her class, Akane’s development as a character from the nervous rookie to what she becomes in the end was a pleasant surprise, and the crowning achievement of Psycho Pass as an anime. \nKougami Shinya: What makes Kougami a decent character is the fact that he is basically the polar opposite of Akane. Skilled and deadly at his profession, Kougami is an enforcement officer of the MWPSB whose main flaw is in his strength. Seemingly invincible at times, his badass-ery is the very reason why so many people love him and others hate him. While it is definitely nice to have such a character for the sake of action, the very fact that he is basically unbeatable takes away from the tension of many key moments. Plot armor can only go so far before it becomes absurd.\nMakishima Shougo: It’s a shame that Makishima turned out the way he did. Initially portrayed as a very mysterious and intelligent antagonist who had an unhealthy affinity for Kougami, what his character eventually turned into was Gen Urobuchi’s walking quote machine. With that said, there’s nothing much else to comment about his character. Since his role is doomed to be one without an actual identity, there is really no way to salvage his character.\nOverall, the cast of Psycho-Pass is relatively plain, but by no means terrible. Highlighted by an excellently fleshed out character, Tsunemori Akane, the cast of Psycho-Pass, like many others of the genre, just fail to stand out. \n\nEnjoyment(8/10)\nWhat irks me the most when I hear people talk about Psycho-Pass is that they hail it as this sort of thought-provokingly mature show that only intelligent people can understand. If you take in Psycho-Pass like that, not only will you be disappointed, but you will probably miss the actual point of the show. In the end, Psycho-Pass is a police drama. These types of shows tend to focus on providing tense, adrenaline-pumping suspense. Psycho-Pass is a very entertaining show if you take it in like that. Although the show does attempt to convince the viewer to believe that there is something more to what is initially presented, messy execution dampens the realization of these messages. Let’s just say if you go into this show expecting something like Serial Experiments Lain, you will be vehemently disappointed.  \nOverall: aka TL/DR version of the review \nOverall, when it comes to describing Psycho-Pass, all I can say is that it bit off more than it could chew. Although the messages the show attempts to convey may get the viewer thinking, the impact of delivery is done in an overly pretentious and obvious manner. As a result, the social messages will stir up some thoughts, but they won't leave a lasting impact. To rub salt on the wound, most of the cast is flat and get little to no development. However, the animation is fluid and small nuances of the world are cleverly incorporated, although the character designs are rather unbecoming. The music is very high quality and fitting, and the voice acting is generally great. Although some tracks do get repetitive, the overall sound set is excellent. All in all, I would definitely recommend Psycho-Pass to someone who wants to enjoy a darker, “action-y” show with a twist; however, it is far from a proper social commentary that other shows of the same genre have delivered.   \nAverage score: 8.2/10 \nWeighted score: 6/10 “Fine” \n(if the rating confuses you, take a glimpse at my rating system on my profile for clarifications)"},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=21,   ["text"]="                          \n    Psycho Pass is another dark sci-fi - cyberpunk title from Production IG which became beloved by many since it came out and for good reason.. That reason being that we don't get enough cyberpunk titles in anime so I guess beggars can't be choosers.\nI don't think too highly of this series, but hopefully fans will understand where I'm coming from. For a change, this review will be separated in to \"Positive\" and \"Negative\" parts since I think that's the best way to approach it. \nThere's gonna be some very subtle spoilers, but I'll try my best to keep them minimal. I'm certainly not spoiling anything\n          \n        major.\nQuick synopsis;\nThe story takes place in a futuristic Japan where we follow a team of policemen dedicated to maintaining public order in a society where everything is run by the Sybil system. This system has the ability  to scan your brain to see how likely you are to commit a crime and even figure out the careers you're suited for.\n*Positive*\n1. Great production values: \nThe sci fi setting looks very dark and cool. The lighting effects are very well done, the fights are generally smooth and well choreographed and the CGI is integrated nicely since it's limited to machines only.  Even when the characters are just standing around there's often something interesting to look at in the background so it does a decent job in making the city feel alive. The only complaints I have is that from time to time there were some animation glitches and that the character designs are made by the creator of Hitman Reborn - which means she goes out of her way to design very handsome boys and cute girls, which doesn't fit the mature vibe this series has.\nThe soundtrack also has an interesting variety of tunes. Everything from classical music to rock with retarded Engrish lyrics and everything in between. I can't point at a single track that I particularly love, but it definitely has variety and its usually placed well. Voice acting is pretty good too since it has quite a few famous actors and they each fit their roles rather well. When they try to emote it does become a little over the top at points, but they still pull through. I also took a listen to the dub and it doesn't sound half bad.\n2. It's cyberpunk:\nThis is kind of a personal thing, but we don't get much of this genre in anime and it's one that I'm very fond of. \n3. It has a focused narrative:\nEverything in the series begins and ends with the Sybil system. You can watch any episode of this show, look in to any event or character interaction and see that everything is related in some way to the core of the series. This is also the show's biggest downfall (I'll get to that), but at the same time it's kinda praiseworthy. You also have other interesting topics that are touched upon along the way like the benefits and dangers of Transhumanism, but these things aren't really relevant in the long run, they're just added in order to flavor the futuristic setting. I have no complaints though, it did its job and it's cool.\n\n*Negative*\n1. Questionable foundations and mixed messages:\nAlmost the entire series is dedicated to showing us how bad the Sybil system is. Right from the first episode we get a glimpse of that as we witness both a kidnapper and his victim sentenced to death by the system because their psycho pass became too clouded-  and that's the entire narrative in a nutshell. You see, in this system even the victim gets punished because their mental health is damaged, therefore they become latent criminals. Depending on the level of damage they will either be executed or sent to rehabilitation (and it was explicitly stated that the latter doesn't recover most people).  If creating a cruel world is all the series set out to do, that'd be fine (albeit very one sided and predictable) but no, at points it tries to convince the audience that this system is ultimately for the greater good and that there's no better alternative. Which I personally find insulting since it did very little to justify its existence or show its benefits. \nI even came across a disturbing review of this series (by an American no less) - who'd love nothing more than to establish this system in real life... Because apparently living in a first world constitutional republic is not good enough for him. People need to have their civil rights stripped away, their brains examined 24/7 and victims should be punished... in exchange for what? There were many instances in the series which demonstrate that crime rates are still pretty high despite all that, and yet the public is still ignorant to what a crime actually is. So excuse me for not seeing the benefits here. \nEven though it's tempting, I'm not gonna question how this system came to be in the first place since in reality we have some examples of unsustainable ways of life that came about, like Communism for example. But I'd still argue that if it wanted to take a favorable or even a neutral stance regarding it, then they should've shown us more of the benefits of this system and not just the flaws for the sake of superficial entertainment and gore.\n2. The characters are defined by their beliefs: \nThe vast majority of screen time for the characters is focused on watching them do their jobs. We don't get to know them too well on a personal level and every action they take seems to be a commentary on what their beliefs are and not who they are as people. Every interaction they have seems to connect to the setting and the central theme in some way. For that reason, I find it hard to connect with them on a personal level. Their backstories are brief and mostly told through clunky exposition and their growth primarily has to do with their beliefs. Not to mention that many of them quote books quite often which further damages their characterization and makes them feel like mouthpieces for the scriptwriter rather than independent individuals (Nobody talks like that!). So no matter how much time I spent with these characters it rarely felt like I got to know them anymore than I already did in the first few episodes. I think they could've benefited greatly from a few more casual interactions.\nTo be fair though, we do get some personal insight on the main character, Tsunemori and we get to know who she hangs out with. But her reason for becoming a law enforcer looks almost like a whim since she could've chosen any line of work based on her clear psycho pass.  She doesn't look like police material to me. Kougami is kinda cool I guess, even if his motive is the \"avenge my partner\" cliché and even if he solves mysteries way too quickly based on rather flimsy evidence. Makishima, the antagonist does his job ok, but he's also the most notorious quoting machine.  Then there's another character who gets an entire episode dedicated to her backstory.. which ends up going to waste since she plays no role in the actual story and isn't fleshed out further afterwards (unless you include her sexual orientation) . She could've easily been replaced with an A.I or removed altogether and NOTHING would've changed. So it renders  an entire episode (that was randomly interjected after an important revelation) completely pointless for characterization.\nI'm having a hard time coming up with things to say about these characters and that's because there isn't much to them. If you remove the setting and their stances regarding it, there's not much left to talk about.. And unfortunately I can't side with any of them because of the negative nature of this system. Theoretically, the only one I can side with is the antagonist, but even he's a crazed murderer.\n3. Apparent lack of planning in its story and awkward pacing:\nThe first half of the series is semi episodic in nature where the team chase various criminals. Like I said earlier,  these episodes are not intended to flesh out the characters beyond their introduction, nor do they foreshadow the upcoming events in the second half (excluding the introduction to the main antagonist) they're  mainly intended for world building and repeatedly showing us how flawed the system is. And even when there's a two/three episode arc, the beginning of each episode still feels disconnected from how the previous one ended to the point I had to double check if I'm watching the correct one.. It's as if there's something missing in between. This especially becomes noticeable when they shoehorn that pointless flashback episode with no relevance to whatever is happening in the present. This ends up making the series feel both slow and fast at the same time (in a bad way) - slow in the sense that not much of importance is happening - and fast in the sense that there's little breather room in between each mission.\nIn the second half there's more continuity and there's also a fairly exciting build up for the climax, but said climax uses an important aspect of the setting (that factory thingy) that was never mentioned or foreshadowed before the final few episodes and proceeds to use it as the main plot device that leads up to its conclusion. This is pretty bad, especially for a show where the setting is the main focus.\nFurthermore, the ending itself is rubbish since it doesn't provide closure for most characters. Very little has changed and nothing was accomplished so it has \"lazy writing\" written all over it. \nNow, I know that there's a second season, but even most fans seem to dislike it so excuse me for doubting that this has been fixed without actually watching it yet.\n\n*Conclusion*\nDespite all my complaints I did somewhat enjoy it for the cool factor. Was it bad? Nah, I think  it's still a lot more interesting than most anime that come out these days. On the other hand, I don't think it's nearly as good as people make it out to be and I believe that even beggars should be choosers in some cases."},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=25,   ["text"]="                          \n    Psycho-Pass has the interesting premise of the \"machine-operated\" Sibyll system as the main form of governance in a seemingly utopian world (which very quickly reveals itself to be the opposite). This lends the story a sense of blurring between good and evil-- I often found myself sympathizing with the antagonist's causes. However, character development in terms of both depth and pacing was lacking. The relationship between the protagonists Akane & Kougami develop far too quickly for Kougami's portrayal as a stoic man who keeps to himself. Within two episodes, they seem to already reach a deep bond without having much of a lead-up to it.\n          \n        In addition, the writers have the typical issue of \"telling instead of showing\". The anime has Akane narrating the supposedly obsessive connection between Kougami and Makishima (referring to it as some sort of destiny), instead of the interactions and animations showing this emotion (facial expressions were *not* this anime's forte).  Other backstories were not fleshed out either-- Ginoza and Masaoka, Karanomori and Kunizuka. In other words, writers at times provide viewers with leads without conclusion and conclusions without many leads, resulting in a sense of disparity between the anime's goals/intentions and the viewer's experience. \ntl;dr For an anime with a psychological premise, the psychology of the characters were greatly underdeveloped. However, still an enjoyable series if you are typically interested in dystopian futures and conflicting ideologies (neither of which can be truly labelled as good or bad).\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=25,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\nNo matter where you live, who you are, or what your perspective on life is, it's a pretty irrefutable fact that planet Earth is filled to the brim with misery and despair. Three billion people, nearly half of the entire world, live on just $2.50 per day in terrible poverty; the same poverty that kills over 22,000 children every single day. Over a billion people entered the 21st century without knowing how to read or write their own name. Every 30 seconds, someone in the world will die because they don't have access to basic sanitation, not even clean water. It's estimated that\n          \n        over half a million people are murdered throughout the world every year, as millions more are raped, tortured, mugged, etc.\nBut what if I told you that one day, technology would improve to the point that none of these things need to exist any longer? Would you want to be a part of a world that has no poverty, no violence, no unemployment, no illiteracy, and no unsanitary conditions? A world that maintains complete and total uniformity? The only catch: you have no free will. This is the question posed to us by writer Gen \"The butcher\" Urobuchi in his fantastic anime series titled \"Psycho-Pass\".\nPlot: 7/10\nSynopsis:  The series takes place in the near future; a future in which society has become a utopia. This new society is built around the ability of advanced technology to instantaneously measure and quantify a person's state of mind and personality. This information is recorded and processed into the form of a \"Psycho-Pass\", which refers to a color-coded standard used to measure a person's state of mind. If your Psycho-Pass becomes too cloudy, you are instantly arrested in the anticipation that you might commit a crime due to your current mental state. This is the story of a team of policemen dedicated to maintaining public order in the utopian society and the ethical dilemmas they encounter in their line of work. \nWhile settings involving a dystopian society are certainly nothing new, Psycho-Pass completely understands that fact. It goes as far as to reference famous works of dystopian literature such as \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\". Make no mistake, this is a very intelligent show that requires thought to be put into it. This anime establishes early on that it's an original take on an unoriginal idea, and what a fantastic take it turned out to be.\nThe true strength of Psycho Pass' plot, much like the strength of a work of dystopian literature, is the thought-provoking and significant questions that is raises. Is it right to arrest people who have committed no crime as long as it maintains order? Is the system that determines who is \"good\" and who is \"bad\" truly accurate enough to be justifiable? Or my personal favorite, Does living in a perfect society mean anything if you have no free will?\nUnlike works similar too it, however, Psycho Pass is not a traditional social commentary.  Rather then clearly exploiting tell-tale flaws in its utopian society, it instead opts to offer several different points of view on the society through its characters, which I will talk about more later. By focusing the plot on the beliefs and motivations of the characters and creating an extremely immersive and incredibly cool science-fiction based world, Psycho Pass is just immensely enjoyable in so many different ways.\nThe reason I take off points is because Psycho Pass' first half seems to drag on for a bit. While it is setting up key themes that become immensely important later on, the pacing is a tad too slow and that could easily turn a lot of people off to the series. Regardless, I was very happy with the setting, content, and direction of the plot; it certainly worked in its own favor.\nArt: 10/10\nWithout a doubt, this is some of the best animation I've ever seen. Production IG knocked it out of the park. Everything looks crisp, the character designs are superb, the occasional CGI looks amazing, and the 2nd OP has my favorite animation for an OP of all time; it looks indescribably cool.\nSound: 10/10\nOne of my all time favorite soundtracks in anime hands down. Both OPs and both EDs are spectacular, which is a rarity. The OST is engaging, fast-paced, and fits the setting of the show perfectly. The voice acting is also stellar in both the sub and the dub, so take your pick. You really can't ask for a better soundtrack then what Psycho Pass delivered.\nCharacters: 8/10\nDespite the engrossing plot, breathtaking visuals, and a kick-ass soundtrack, the characters of Psycho-Pass are what truly steal the show. So often in anime, you will have one, maybe two characters who stand out above the rest and dominate the screen time, but that is not Psycho-Pass; EVERY character in unique, EVERY character receives development, and EVERY character is notable. Considering that season two is coming up, I am shaking with anticipation just by thinking about how these stellar characters will be built upon.\nFrom the dynamic traits and intricate personality of protagonist Akane Tsunemori (such rare characteristics in a female character), to the cunning badassery of Shinya Kougami, to the intoxicating allure of intelligent antagonist Shougo Makishima, to many more unbelievably fleshed out and developed characters, I am convinced that it is impossible to not have blast by watching this cast of characters. Makishima in particular stands out as a very complex villain who seeks to reform the society he perceives as corrupt by any means necessary, making the struggle between good and evil FAR from black and white. If you don't find at least one character that you truly enjoy, then I don't know what to tell you; this is truly some spectacular writing right here. Gen Urubuchi is known for his ability to write good plots, but the characters are what shine in Psycho-Pass.\nOverall: 8/10\nTruly a great anime. Whether you watch it for its thought provoking themes or for the gigantic amount of entertainment it provides (or both), experiencing Psycho-Pass is simply a magnificent decision. What are you waiting for? Go watch it! I highly doubt you will be disappointed, because there are very few things to dislike. Here's to season 2!\n        "},

One day... you may face such a moment of crisis. And in that moment, I hope you have a friend like I did, to plunge their hands into the filth so that you can keep yours clean!\" - Jim Gordon, The Dark Knight Rises\nFrom a very young age, I've always been fascinated with police procedural television series, the most notable ones being Law and Order and its spin-off Law and Order: Special Victims Unit. Of the two, I only fully\n          \n        completed Law and Order, while dropping SVU at its 12th season, when Christopher Meloni left the show. This kind of symbolized my departure from television series into a fully devoted transition to the anime world. This was back in 2011. But even then, my love for Law and Order hadn't swindled. If I caught a rerun of its earlier season on TV, I'd sit down and watch it. I love the procedural police genre that much. So imagine my reaction when an anime was announced in 2012 that was a part of this subgenre. It immediately became my most hyped anime for 2012 and I couldn't wait for it to air. And what a joy it was to watch it when it did. \nPsycho-Pass takes place in a dystopian future set in the year 2113, where the Sibyl System actively monitors the citizens of Japan's mental state linked to their probability of committing a crime. This assessment is what is known as a Psycho Pass, showcased as a hue and a number. This number is measured by the Crime Coefficient (CC from now on), and when the probability of committing a crime becomes too high in a person, the System marks them and orders the Public Safety Bureau (PSB from now on) to pursue and apprehend. Now this is where it gets interesting.\n The task force is armed with a gun called the Dominator which, when aimed, measures the targets CC on the spot and gives out three possible judgments: innocent (gun locks itself), dangerous but not that dangerous (gun paralyzes), or dangerous and in need of elimination (gun kills). The PSB Criminal Investigation Division is divided into two sets of people: the Inspectors and the Enforcers. The Enforcers are themselves latent criminals, meaning that their CC has reached a point of no return and have accepted an offer by the System to become a part of the task force without going to prison. The Inspectors basically keep the Enforcers under control (like a master holding his dog by a leash) and have the authority to paralyze the Enforcers if they ever disobey orders or go buck wild.\nSTORY \nThe story begins with Akane Tsunemori, a new Inspector of Unit One as she joins the PBS. She has no idea how to do her job as an Inspector and is basically thrust into the world of crime. The story follows her and the rest of Unit One as they take on several cases throughout the series. The series is episodic in nature, but it does have an overarching story, which is quite noticeable since its basically linked at the end of every arc in the series. The series is 22 episodes long, written by the master of darkness and despair Gen Urobuchi. Now, you have been warned. If you haven't seen a series by Urobutcher before, let me say this from the get-go: do not get too attached to the characters. That is all.\nThe story is excellent, to say the least. It delves deep into the theme of morality, what is right and what is wrong. And it's Akane that generally has the voice of reason questioning this fact, being the rookie and all. The show portrays just how dependent humans have become of technology, and this is best seen on episode one, where a  woman is kidnapped, and when rescued, discovers that due to the horrifying experience, her Psycho Pass has deteriorated and her CC has risen. The Enforcer, being told by the Dominator that she is a threat to society, proceeds to kill her, but Akane paralyzes him (Kogami Shinya) in order to stop him from doing so, so she can then proceed to calm her down and lower her CC. It really likes to explore this concept, and it's brilliantly well executed. \nEach episode likes to keep you in rage inducing cliff hangers (rage at the time when it was airing because I wanted to see the next episode immediately after) and provides plenty of twists and turns. However, it is pretty simple to follow and the whole plot could be said in a single paragraph, but I won't do so for obvious reasons. Now there is a trade off, the first episode may shy away viewers for its gruesome and gory climax (and trust me, it did shy away a friend of mine to whom I recommended this show too). This doesn't mean that Psycho Pass is a gore fest, no no. Rather, Psycho Pass is a well crafted story, but it is strong and mature the entire ride. I would not recommend it to a younger audience nor those who are weak hearted or squeamish. \nANIMATION \nPsycho Pass was developed by studio Production IG, famous for their relatively high budget shows, such as Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Higashi no Eden and Guilty Crown. There really isn't much to say here that hasn't already been said elsewhere other than that it does provide some really nice eye candy for the viewers. The fight scenes in particular are amazingly well animated with the characters moving in real time. The character designs were done by Amano Akira, famous for her long running shonen series Reborn. Those who have seen or read Reborn in the past (like me) will immediately notice just how similar some character designs are, but that's not a problem in my book. \nThe only real problems I had with the animation were in episodes 17 and 18, where the quality kind of took it down a notch. It isn't all that noticeable, and Production IG have remade the episodes, so major props to that. However, there are some scenes throughout the series where the character faces aren't all that consistent, especially in the scenes where the characters are discussing a case and simply talking. \nSOUND \nOh my God, yes. The soundtrack for Psycho Pass is arguably its greatest feature. Composed by Yugo Kanno, who also composed the soundtrack for Birdy The Mighty Decode, the music simply fits into the show and never feels out of place. When there's a chase scene, or a fight scene, or a simple chatting scene, the music is always there to fulfill its purpose, and it does so beautifully.\nThe anime sports two opening and endings. The first opening Abnormalize, performed by Ling Tosite Sigure, is a fast paced opening which fits the theme of Psycho Pass perfectly. It is replaced at episode twelve by Out of Control, performed by Nothing's Carved in Stone, a song sung in engrish which also fits the show extremely well. The first ending for Psycho Pass is The Monster With No Name, performed by Egoist. I must say, this song is pure awesomeness and I seriously do not regret the countless hours I have spent listening to it on repeat. The second ending is called All Alone With You, also performed by Egoist. This song is more mellow and slow paced than the first one, and it encapsulates well with what happens in later episodes. \nDue to time constraints, the endings had to be played in the background during the final scenes of some episodes. There are also some episodes that use different verses of the ending songs, for example episode eleven. Personally, I really liked this small detail, as it gave it a more epic (yes, epic) sense of closure.\nCHARACTERS \nI had problems with the characters in this series. The ones the show focuses on are really well developed and we are able to see them change throughout the series, but then there are some that are just outright neglected by the series. The show follows Unit One and all of its members. Unit One is composed of two Inspectors, four Enforcers and an Analyst.\nThe two Inspectors are Akane, the female lead, and Nobuchika Ginoza, the stern stuck up leader of Unit One. The Enforcers are as follows: Kogami Shinya, the male lead; Tomomi Masaoka, the father figure of the members of Unit One and the eldest; Shuusei Kagari, the jokester of the group who became a latent criminal at the age of five; and Yayoi Kunidzuka, the only female Enforcer and the drone specialist. The Analyst for Unit One is also a latent criminal that goes by the name of Shion Kanamori, in charge of supporting the team with medical aspects and so on and so forth.\nThe shows main antagonist is called Makishima Shougo, arguably the most interesting character of the story. I won't say much about this guy because it'll be rearing heavily into spoilers, but I honestly haven't had this much fun watching an anime villain since the spine chillingly scary Johan Liebert from Monster and the incredibly charismatic Count from Gankutsuou.\nLike I said before, the show focuses heavily on some characters, not all of them. I am, of course, talking about Akane, Kogami, and Makishima. The rest of the supporting cast, while brilliant in their own rights, aren't given proper back stories and are there just for the sake of the others. I really liked all the characters in this series, especially the Enforcers, but they just aren't given the attention they so much deserve.\nENJOYMENT \nAs I said before, I am a HUGE fan of police procedural series. When Psycho Pass was announced, I immediately wanted to see it. And good God did it deliver. Generally, I don't like to wait week after week for an anime, I like to let them end and then marathon it. But Psycho Pass was so darned good that I had to keep watching. I enjoyed it way too much. That being said, this isn't a show for everyone. This is seinen people. It's mature and it's dark, but most importantly, it was written by the Urobutcher. Be prepared for this anime, cause it will take you for a tremendously high speed ride. And if this review motivates you into watching Psycho Pass, once you watch episode 16, come back to me and we can discuss Urobuchi's masterpiece over some tea and crumpets.\nMy final verdict for this anime is a well deserved, 9.2 out of 10. \nI re-watched this series for the second time a few weeks ago and decided to make a review about it. Huge thanks to firealchemist for proofreading this, go check her out! Also, this was my first review ever, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="                          \n    Psycho-Pass is a sci-fi psychological thriller set in a dystopian future where psychological scans determine whether someone is fit to be a member of society. The show draws most of its inspiration from the works of Philip K. Dick, mainly Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (which was adapted into Blade Runner) and The Minority Report (again, adapted into a film). The show merges pulse-pounding action sequences with psychological horror, while delving perhaps a little to deep into the criminal mind. It's smart, it's beautiful, and it'll leave you wanting more.\n\nTo fully understand the story, you need a bit of context with this world. Decades\n          \n        before, the Sybil system was implemented, a system that could accurately quantify the psychological state of an individual and determine if they were a risk to society - this value is their Psycho-Pass. People whose Psycho-Pass went too high are given mandatory counseling, and if it rises too much, are arrested and placed in facilities for the protection of themselves and others. These people are 'latent criminals'.\nOur protagonist, Tsunemori, is a rookie detective tasked with investigating crimes and tracking down these latent criminals. To do this, she acts as a handler for 'Enforcers', latent criminals who work for the police; their altered perception of the world allows them to more easily get into the heads of the criminals, and they serve as a psychological buffer for the detectives. The main enforcer is Kougami, and he and Tsunemori quickly make a great team, along with the other Enforcers.\nOf course, no good show is without its conflict, and as Tsunemori and Kougami unravel a few cases, a disturbing pattern begins to emerge, linking them into a plot far more sinister than the sum of its parts. It's smart, it'll keep you guessing, and it never lets up. It's nearly perfect, besides a few slow sections, the motivations of some of the antagonists, and one or two very minor plot holes. 9/10\n\nThe Art style looks great, focusing mainly on dark colors in sharp contrast, and patterns are used often to help distinguish between them. I found small shifts in posture and stance to be quite effective and kept the show from feeling too static at times. It's got a very Noir feel to it, the closest I can get is Cowboy Bebop, but with fewer bright colors, aside from billboards and holographic projections that keep the theme of a gilded age. It's very Blade Runner, and that's a serious compliment. Everything looks fantastic, and it fits the feel of the show like a glove. 9/10\n\nThe sound design is good, keeping the tension up and offering a mixture of electronic and classical styles. It does what it has to, and serves to compliment the visuals rather than overpower them. It knows when to die down and when to soar. It's nor memorable, but it's very effective. 8/10\n\nCharacterization is very important with a psychological show, and Psycho-Pass does an excellent job. In particular, they go into great detail showing the psychological state, delusions, and motivations behind the villains. They range from tormented people driven out of desperation to the truly psychopathic and bloodthirsty, and they're both intriguing and terrifying. The Enforcers are equally disturbing at times, ranging from apathetic to sociopathic to deranged obsessiveness. They're all simultaneously human, though, and as much as you might want to demonize them, you can't help but feel that they're human - reflections of the darkest aspects of humanity. It's very effective and it keeps you thinking about the show well after the episode is over. 9/10\n\nPsycho-Pass is an excellent show, the kind of thing you discuss with your friends after watching it and you swap conspiracy theories and wild speculation. The show presents the world through the eyes of detective Tsunemori, and as we see more of the world and grow more disillusioned and even terrified of it, so does Tsunemori evolve from a naive novice to a skilled and determined detective. 9/10\nThe show is absolutely stunning, and aside from its propensity to quote Shakespeare and Heart of Darkness at inappropriate times, it's an incredibly intelligent and thought provoking science-fiction thriller. Other shows might draw from esteemed writers to seem intelligent, but Psycho-Pass pulls it off with flying colors. If you haven't seen it and you like your anime smart, watch Psycho-Pass.\n        "},

While I did enjoy it immensely I have to say it suffered from some issues that I'll put in the \"criticisms\" section. There will be some spoilers in there so be prepared. With that out of the way, lets get on with the rest of the spoiler free review!\nStory (8) - The story as stated in the first sentence follows\n          \n        the life of CID newbie Akane Tsunemori. She meets her senior inspector Ginoza and also four latent criminals called Enforcers who will be their partners or slaves depending on how you look at. Together they'll solve cases and protect the population in the name of Sibyl, the ultimate protector, who decides who is good or bad for society based on the color of their Psycho-pass, which is a universal meter that is on everyone in society. \n                   This series at its core is a coming of age story for Akane. She starts the series as someone who knows nothing about the world, but through the eyes of Kogami, an enforcer whom she handles, she sees the world in a completely different way. It's not all rainbows in the utopian society, and through her new job she'll experience just what it takes to make a \"perfect\" world prosper. \nMy strikes against the story honestly fall down to the episodic nature of the first part of the story and one extremely pointless episode in the 2nd half. \nArt (8) - The art is good, but nothing spectacular. The world of Psycho-pass seems to excel at night, which is when the series is at its best plotwise as well. While it does have scenes that take place during the day, most of them are just filler scenes. Almost all of the series takes place in the main city as well, so there isn't much room for varied settings. The characters are all designed pretty well, but don't stand out at the same time. All in all there's really nothing horribly wrong with the art, but I thought they could have done a little better with it.\nSound (9) - This is one of my favorite parts of Psycho pass. The Openings and Endings of the show are both spectacular. I watched them every time, despite having the ability to skip them (blu ray). The ost also matched and helped scenes for the most part as well. \nCharacters (8) - The characters in show are where many opinions seem to vary. Were they good? Were they bad? Well if you ask me, with few exceptions, they were good.\nAkane - (Good/Decent) - She ,to be honest, starts out as a boring and useless character at the start of the show. She really doesn't know the world, but does start to learn about it and change. I feel it was intentional to make her start out like that so we could watch her grow on her journey. I liked her at the end so it worked for me. \nKogami - (Good) - The main enforcer in the show. Kogami while not really unique or special worked for me. His back story was good and well foreshadowed. His and Akane's relationship also made them both better characters. \nThe Antagonist(s) - (Good) - Without spoiling this character, other than the fact that one does show up, I will say they were well done. I won't go more into details, so if you want to know more, watch the show.\nGinoza/Kagai/Masaoka - (Good) - They all were done pretty well done. Their personal issues and personalities were all believable and well foreshadowed. \nYayoi/Shion - (Bad) - These characters really had no development whatsoever and really didn't do anything for me. While Shion was important in the story jobwise her character just was lacking to me. I really don't know how else to put it, they were boring.\nEnjoyment (9) - While I did have issues with it overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit. I enjoyed the ride, and in the end that's all that matters.\nCriticisms (Spoilers) - \nAkane's Psycho-Pass - I don't really feel this part of the story was explained well, or really at all. Akane psycho-pass barely changes despite the horrible mind exploding shit she sees. I don't feel the explanation that \"she's just that type of person\" is good enough at all. It just felt like hand-wave reason so she could experience stuff that no one else could....which is silly in such an intelligent story.\nSibyl System's True Origin - Okay this was also just stupid. How was a system of sociopath brains even implemented? Who the hell approved this? Did it start with just one brain or did they collect a bunch before doing it? While I love this series, I just can't help but feel this was just ridiculous. It was again a hand-wave shock value revelation.\nOverall (9) - Despite my multiple issues with show that make it seem like I hated it, I really didn't at all. It was for the most part an intelligent show. Hopefully some of my issues get resolved in the upcoming season 2, but if not it won't change the fact I'll be watching it. So in summation, if you want a good sci-fi show with some interesting concepts, characters, and story check out Psycho-pass. While it may not be perfect, it's still pretty damn good.\n"},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    [Thar be spoilers ahead, but they be dumb anyway.]\nWhen I first watched Psycho Pass I thought it was a decent sci-fi show and didn’t think much of it afterwards, much like I didn’t think much of Sword Art Online or Valvrave The Liberator when I saw those around the same time. Now hold up, those are some pretty abysmal titles right there, and Psycho Pass is a fairly well received anime. Why create such a comparison? Could it be that this show is just as embarrassingly bad as those famous trainwrecks?\nThat’s probably it.\nWhat we have here is a cop show set in a dystopian society\n          \n        where a judgement system decides if people are criminals based solely on their level of mental stability. The system holds ultimate control over this judgement, and in a team of investigators and enforcers, a new rookie member and an exceptionally smart criminal are about to shake things up in the system, plunging the city into disarray and uncovering government secrets.\nGen Urobuchi wrote an emotionally strong narrative with Madoka Magica, and delivered solid themes of stubborn idealism in Fate/Zero. Now he’s going to tackle a landslide of highly complex concepts that require precision handling of both character and narrative. In Psycho Pass, Gen appears to be trying to convince both himself and the audience that every single solitary line these characters say is intelligent and worthwhile. Everyone with more than five minutes of screentime talks like a seasoned philosophy lecturer, spouting out eloquent words and larger-than-life concepts without breaks. Every scene is stuffed with speech that tries to extract as much intellectual emotion out of it, no matter how it fits or flows in the big picture. What little personalities the main cast exhibit are set aside for infodumping drones that condescendingly explain whatever random theme Gen wants to preach about.\nEvery episode requires a direct quote from outside texts that draw similarities to the concepts that he fumbles with. It’s awfully strange how everyone in this society that doesn’t have use for advanced education is proficient in philosophical literature. If you recall my review of Blast Of Tempest, many viewers were convinced that the writing was Shakespearean just because this shounen fighting anime directly referenced two books of his. Imagine if these people were suddenly bombarded with continuous excerpts from Plato, Descartes, Shakespeare, Orwell, and Gibson? Because other intelligent writing is spliced into Gen’s story, people immediately call Psycho Pass intelligent. But pulling content from celebrated minds into a weak cop show does not transfer their credit to Gen. What he does with the content is erratic and ineffective in enforcing his thematic direction, and it only serves to make the dialogue unrealistically overblown and pretentious. \nWhile the writer incessantly screams that his doings are smart and worthwhile, the setting of his narrative alone proves that feeble minds are behind this overly ambitious narrative. The Orwellian surveillance system of the city constantly draws contradictions in the story, as it completely misses the mass production of criminal equipment and fails to capture video evidence of a villain who roams the streets and buildings like everyone else. The special guns, said to biologically read and pinpoint someone’s stress levels for paralyzation or execution can somehow work efficiently on inorganic robots as well. The police force appears to be made up of only a few small teams of detectives and enforcers, sending out only three teams to counter a dozen city riots, leaving police HQ completely deserted and susceptible to a tiny attack that exposes a totally incompetent security system. Near the end of the show, we find out that the sole base of agricultural operations has antiquated security systems and no human regulators, threatening of mass starvation should it be compromised.\nCitizen reactions to police enforcement and criminal doings fail to enforce a single mood or theme in the story. Some folks spontaneously become nuts because someone else also goes nuts and riots unfold, or entire street crowds witness a rape murder on an open walkway and tape it with their phones while they stare on emotionlessly. The show treats psychopathic criminal actions as a contagious disease, which is more the product of a writer who plays with shocking twists and absurd plotpoints than one who has any sort of grasp on human psychology. Exposure to crime yields influence or stress, but both require law enforcement. We, the audience, already know that this system is batshit stupid and impossible to get behind, so we are immediately estranged to our main characters who enforce it. \nOn the topic of this show’s idea of stress = criminal, how unhealthy it must be both for more impressionable minds watching the show and the seinen audience who is somehow taking this seriously? Society today already has extremely unhealthy and delusional ideals linking mental health to criminal action, and the show’s commentary about that link is way too extremely weak and insufficient to be valuable criticism. The narrow minded view of how the psyche works in the setting tests our patience to the point of being insulting, and the infusion of overdone anime horror elements to portray said mental instability is only more polarizing. It would be laughable if it weren’t so harmful and shallow to those who get into the show.\nThis viewpoint on [(stress = criminal) = dumb] is the predictable theme for the show to tackle, and to nobody’s surprise, it focuses a bit on those topics in the first half. Incredibly, however, the show pulls a stunt to take the narrative down an even more feeble-minded route. The police force finds that their enforcement guns do not work on a mastermind villain because his stress levels are too low, even though he commits murder right before their eyes. Although this occasion, displaying mental stability when committing crime, is valid and normal, the villain reveals that his mental state is simply exempt from the judgement system.\nThis is so counterintuitive I don’t even know where to begin. Upon the revelation that one in 2 million people possess this trait in their society, we shift focus from a butchered albeit addressable topic, to a shallow goose chase to find this guy, lasting the rest of the show. The subsequent creation of a mask that projects a healthy stress level onto the wearer (although, again, the guns should logically bypass mechanics completely and read biological forms), only amplifies this shallow turn of events to portray the polarizing mental states of the citizens in even more insulting ways.\nSpeaking of self-destructive twists and braindead worldbuilding, the all powerful judgement system is revealed to us. A technological cluster of 247 human brains, taken from the skulls of those who couldn’t be judged because they were simply special snowflakes like our villain; another gross generalization of the human psyche. And wouldn’t you know it, they want him on the team too. The route of a mentally sound criminal with agency is begun and is still trying to be salvaged, but this development makes any of it completely invalid and narratively worthless. It was a given from the first 10 minutes of the show that the system was simpleminded, illogical, and horribly conceived. So this twist only serves to confirm that Gen has no idea what the fuck he’s working with.\nThe impossibly smart system of 200 brains, operating through the chief of police, proceeds to demonstrate that it is actually the impossibly stupid system of 200 brains. It immediately starts demanding that our newly escaped mastermind mass murdering villain be brought back alive while ordering the enforcer who wants a bullet in his head off of the operation. Of course the detectives are onto this thirty seconds later and suspect the chief of being an actual illogical dumbass. Then, in the presence of five police officers, the system of 200 brains uses its influence to force a detective’s gun into execute mode, lightly suggesting that the enforcer be murdered immediately. Real subtle, 200 brains. Gen creates the smartest Godlike entity in the world and writes it as an idiotic nut who logically chooses immediate desire over its own imperative secrecy.\nOn the subject of villains, of course the master criminal is another walking talking philosophy professor with a particularly bad haircut, though his fetish for books (I wish that was a joke) makes it at least a bit more reasonable when he quotes text left and right. What I also wish to be a joke is how many people sincerely connect with him to the point of justification. Connecting with villains isn’t a bad thing, that’s their purpose in a story, but the amount of people who believe that his actions towards citizens are actually beneficial is just as disconcerting as the show’s portrayal of human mentality. The disconnect from the workings of society explain why people gravitated to him, but when you step back and realize that neither party is righteous in any way, a red alarm ought to go off in a normal viewer’s head.\nSo after all of that, what’s the main message of Psycho Pass anyway? The show is an obvious product of a desire to seem smart without actually putting in the work. Because of this we get mini story arcs for mini philosophy lectures, regurgitating even more outside narratives and themes. But aside from these safe detours, what original thought is Gen trying to say with his fictional judgement system?\nHonestly, Psycho Pass isn’t committed to one. It’s rather funny witnessing this show trying to end on some solid note, we instead get fractured messages that are both good and bad. Stepping outside the law if it be truly unjust to people is warranted, as is the pursuit of happiness in a system of compliance and compromised freedom. But when Gen tries to take the reigns and come up with something original, things gets ugly. His word continues to be as such: Society sucks now, but bear with it, find happiness but remain compliant while the government sluggishly progresses. Argue with me, but I don’t find this to be a good message to relay. Overall, government has taken huge leaps forward solely because of dissent, and it has proven to be the most efficient way of changing the ruling system to fit evolving ideals of civil liberty and a content society. As if Gen was shooting himself in the foot, the last five minutes of his show are a perfect narrative parallel of the first five minutes, an unwise visual element to end on. So, while Gen is spinning around hopelessly in a circle after all the smart literature he claims to understand is run dry, he offers no solid original messages.\nI could go on. I could say how Gen’s sexism becomes disgustingly apparent in this show with the amount of gratuitous assault content. I could list the narratives he rips off from anime, literature, and film alongside his endless quotes. I could demonstrate how the Ghost In The Shell show tackled similar episodic and long-running narratives and themes in efficient and original ways a decade before this. But I guess I just did.\nJust as baffling as this disaster of writing is the animation job by Production IG. While a very nice budget was obviously accrued for this project, the art design team was clearly made up of monkeys. The main cast looks like they fell out of Kurouko No Basuke (minus the rainbow hair), while the background cast ranges from Stand Alone Complex leftovers to Dusk Maiden Of Amnesia characters. There is also no sense whatsoever of a solid setting. It is a mish-mosh of cool futuristic gadgets and technologies, strewn together without thought for superficial entertainment. This disjointed sense in the art style only contributes to the sense of weak worldbuilding.\nFunimation’s dub, while along the same lines of quality as everything else they do, couldn’t save this script if they tried. A bunch of voice actors in a studio recite lectures and sometimes get angry. Kate Oxley as Akane Tsunomori is particularly grating, sounding much more like a twelve year old kid than a rookie out of cop school, and while her character’s overall development is one of the better elements in this show, she feels out of place for the most of it.\nPsycho Pass has the makings of a mediocre cop show, but it is impossible to enjoy those aspects when the writer is constantly trying to prove how smart his dumbass is. The real saving grace of the writing is a narrative that keeps steady pace and holds a decent progression and integration of important events, a simple enough aspect that has killed other promising shows. Still, when the content is as obnoxious as this, the effort to stomach the utter disrespect for the audience’s intelligence is just not worth it.\nWhen all’s said and done, the show at least points you towards the works of fantastic thinkers and competent writers. Check them out, and don’t let Gen talk down to you like some annoying smartass. Your mind is capable of great things, give it some worthwhile content to chew on.\nPsycho Pass:\n4/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    This is a short and spoiler free review.\nPsycho Pass had a great premise and it could have been an excellent series, if only the writers had focused more on the technologies of the future and how they were misused by people for their own purposes. However, the technology took a back seat and the focus was mostly on  solving crimes, which in essence doesn't make it any different from other crime/detective animes. \nThe biggest drawback of this show is its characters. Except 2 villains, NONE of the characters have any character development. They are fairly one (or is it two?) dimensional. The female MC\n          \n        (Akane Tsunamori) is fuking annoying. How the fuk did she even manage to pass her psychological exams (I'm assuming they had those) when she's so fuking naive and stupid? How can a police officer have the luxury of maintaining such ideals, seeing the type of people and crimes her department deals in? And she's so useless even as an inspector. If the woman cannot kill someone who threatens the life of a person she loves, then what the fuk type of a police woman (term used very loosely here) is she? What was all her training for if not to defend the innocent at the expense of her stupid fuking ideals and emotional confusion?????\nFrom what I've observed, this is the biggest drawback with the female characters in anime - \nThey're either tsunderes or unbelievably meek/naive/stupid/gaily/feminine women who don't seem to possess a brain. I guess the men in Japan fail to realize that women can, in fact, be.....*gasp* multi dimensional creatures that can't easily be put into boxes.\nAkane was the WORST thing about the anime. And she isn't even cute. Why do people call her that? Her doe eyes add to her \"naivety\" and made her appear even more unattractive to me. She also did pretty much nothing in the anime. Remove her from it and things would have progressed EXACTLY like they would have. Another useless female \"protagonist\" by male animators. What a surprise.\nPS. The other two female characters were meant to be eye candy. They too had no roles whatsoever in the series. At least up until season 1. Because that's when I stopped watching Psycho Pass.\nPPS. Annoyed because my typos (now corrected) aren't being updated\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="                          \n    Psycho-Pass is a cyberpunk crime drama set in a city near future Japan (big surprise). The population lives under the totalitarian rule of the SYBIL system. But this society is hardly a dystopia; violent crime is incredibly low thanks to the security provided by the SYBIL system, and aptitude tests ensure that citizens are placed into occupations that suit their skills. While the average person may not have a huge amount of freedom in their professional life, the vast majority of people are safe and more or less content. This adds a sense of realism; a governing body that is beneficial to everyone is far\n          \n        more likely to rise to power than a tyrannical one. The moral grayness allows the exploration of many different ideologies and how the people that hold them interact with the system and is one of the series’ greatest strengths.\nThe SYBIL system utilizes “Psycho-Pass” scanners placed around the city to measure the crime coefficient of each individual citizen. If you have a hard time buying into the idea that a person’s likelihood of breaking the law can quantified with a single number, then you might not enjoy Psycho-Pass. It definitely requires some suspension of disbelief and while I thought this premise was not only believable, not incredible engaging, I know others who feel differently. It’s also worth noting that the series is written by Gen Urobuchi who is famous for “shock value”. I personally enjoy his writing, but you should know what you’re getting into. Anyway, back on topic.\nOur protagonists are inspector Akane Tsunemori and Shinya Kogami, an enforcer.  Enforcers are individuals whose Psycho-Pass is in excess of 100 (the legal limit) but are allowed to work in law enforcement due to their skills and as a buffer to the enforcers for the psychological damage caused police work. They work under the inspectors and are still seen as “latent criminals” by the system. The dynamic between Akane and Kogami is one of the more interesting developments in the show. Akane sees protecting the citizens as just as important as upholding the law, which can conflict with the more jaded inspectors. We see the friction this causes between her and her colleagues in the first episode, and it’s instrumental to the development of Akane, Kogami, and Ginoza(another inspector throughout the show). Kogami on the other hand, could be called a loose cannon. He possesses great intuition and experience but isn’t in a position of power, leading to further conflict with the inspectors.\nI actually disliked Akane for a significant portion of the show, partly because I lean towards Makishima’s ideology, but also because she’s incredibly boring, not as a character, but as a person. However, this is intentional; Akane is SYBIL system’s paragon. She is meant to display the epitome of what it wants from a citizen. Her boringness is a reflection a society that values absolute order and conformity.\nKogami Is cynical towards the system while Akane always works within the boundries of the law and her own moral standard. Akane treats Kogami like an actual human being, rather than a “hunting dog”, she sees all of them that way, and her conversations with them shows that she respects them just as much as her fellow inspectors. These conversations allow world building to happen naturally. While we’re learning about the personalities of the individual members of the team, we also get to see some of the negative effects of the system from the perspective of the enforcers who probably experience them the most. However, the dialogue is mostly directed at advancing the narrative, fleshing out the setting, and showing how people with different positions and philosophies (inspector, enforcer, Makishima, etc.) rather than character development. This might be the biggest weakness of the series. Kogami and Akane remain in the spot-light, and Ginoza’s arc allows us to see the psychological consequences of being an inspector, but the supporting characters take the back seat as the main narrative falls into place,  which is a shame, since the other enforcers could potential been just as interesting as Akane and Kogami. Another world building tidbit, Akane is seen interacting with an in home AI, kind of like Jarvis from Iron Man. She tells it what to cook for her, and she uses a hologram that projects virtual close to dress up. The scene shows the technological integration remarkably well.\nThe interactions between the enforcers, while few, were important. In the first episode, the black haired female enforcer is seen leaving the bisexual analysts room as she puts her clothes back on. This acknowledges that sex exists without making fan service out of it. When you consider the lifestyle the enforcers lead, it makes sense that this would happen. They drink, cook, have sex, and do the things that normal people do, only under SYBIL’s very strict surveillance. This makes them seem human despite their high Psycho-Pass ratings. I think the writer’s message is that the outcasts in a system aren’t necessarily insane or even violent. They’re the products of their environment as much as anyone else and sometimes the people who fit right in are actually the most dangerous. This contributes to the moral grayness in a substantial way.\nPyscho-Pass has some exceptional villains; every one of them is memorable as are their crimes, and they contribute to the world building and explore problems with the system just as much as the main characterss. We get to see the effect that conditioning to low/no stress has on the citizens, how crime coefficient is handled in a professional environment, and the ways people express themselves in a world where big brother is watching you. You can sympathize with every antagonist on some level. Even though some are completely insane, it’s clear that living in a society that judges your mind rather than your actions is partially responsible. People who naturally have higher crime coefficients are doomed from the start.\nMakishima, the primary antagonist, is probably the biggest issue people have with the show. Dispelling individual arguments is not the purpose of this review, and delving into his character would naturally require spoilers so I’m going to try to explain why I think he’s a good villain in a very general, spoiler-free way. If you want, I can send you an essay on why I like Makishima. Yes, his philosophical babbling is cheesy at times, but it’s very relevant to his character, not just the quotes he uses but the fact that he uses them at all. By directly quoting Pascal and others he is showing his fondness for long dead authors over currently living people. These authors criticize this type of system and the people content to live under it, mirroring Makishima's beliefs. He is the type of person who would be condemned in any reasonably society and a totalitarian one such as SYBIL is something he is against on principle.\nChildhood abuse is a common tool used in the creation of excessively violent villains. It’s an easy way to justify any horrific actions. I find this incredibly lazy, people with traumatic pasts can turn out good or bad, and using it as an excuse to make someone a sadist feels contrived if they aren’t given further depth. What I like about Makishima’s character is that his personality and backstory, as well as how that personality interacts with the system made it very clear how he became the person he was, specifically that person and no one else. His philosophy is as much the result of growing up in the SYBIL system as it is a justification for his actions. He truly believes that what he is doing is… maybe not morally right, but certainly intended for what he perceives as a more valuable society. That's the key, valuable, not moral. Don't make the mistake of thinking Makishima is poorly written because his philosophy involves killing people in the name of freedom. It isn't about creating a utopia, it's about anarchy. Every violent, chaotic plan he orchestrates is indicative of his ideology, his personality, and his goals. This brings us to the shock value of Psycho-Pass.\nThe infamous bystander affect scene, one of the hardest to watch, and rage inducing moments in anime, at least in my limited experience. This scene is absolutely shock value, and it’s supposed to be, both for the audience and the crowd. The purple haired dude in the crowd even confirms it for us, commenting on its brutality the statement it makes. This scene becomes a symbol of the discord caused by a gaping hole in SYBIL’s oversight. It’s shown on phone screens, the news, it has a massive impact because the population has never seen anything like this before and they’re conditioned for such low stress that they’re legitimately incapable of doing anything in the situation. This is Makishima making a statement in the most horrific way possible. It says “this is the price of your contentedness.”\nWhile hard to watch, this might be the most important moment of the show. This is what distances the viewer who shares Makishima’s sentiments from Makishima, because no matter how much you agree with his ideology, you’re not going to agree with this. It’s a key point in the story and it feels very real. The way it’s portrayed in the show feels exactly like the way it would be received in modern society, but given the effects of low stress conditioning, the impact is greater. I believe this is also a statement from the writer to the audience, and the message is very similar to Makishima’s, it [i]was[/i] written by the Urobutcher after all.\nI felt it necessary to explain the importance of this one particular scene because shock value is often seen as intrinsically bad. This isn’t shock value in the sense that it’s meant solely to cater to the violence hungry part of the audience, every moment of brutality is vitally important to the show. Even the violence in the first episode, which was kind of cheesy, was meant to show off the dominators and the effects of stress on a person’s crime coefficient. This isn't to say that Psycho-Pass is excessively violent. It isn't, the brutality is infrequent and scattered throughout the show. It's sparsity is what makes it impactful, not it's prevalence.\nOnce the plot gets going and many characters fall from relevance, but I was so engaged in the story that I hardly noticed the underdevelopment until much later on. The setting was so impressively detailed that my least favorite episodes were those that brought us to different locations, (an isolated factory, a school, etc.) and it’s a testament to just how interesting the premise is that I wanted the entirety of the show to take place within the originally defined setting. My suspension of disbelief was broken infrequently and in very minor ways.\nI should mention that I’m biased to Urobuchi’s style. Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero, and Psycho-Pass all feature characters who are defined by their ideologies or specific goals more than anything else. They all throw characters with drastically different personalities and philosophies into whatever world the show takes place in, and contrast how the respond to their respective worlds and that drives the relationship between the characters. The dialogue can be a bit hammy at times but is overall very good.\nLet’s move from the meat of Psycho-Pass to its aesthetic.\nI loved the first opening theme. The rest were decent as well. A good OP is always appreciated, but this is fluff. The soundtrack was unmemorable for the most part. The addition of classical music was a nice touch, but none of the tracks stood out as exceptionally good or bad.\nPsycho-Pass is certainly a well animated show. The action is well directed and you get a good sense of spatial awareness, where off screen set pieces are, where everyone is in relation to one another as the camera moves from shot to shot. This is very important in a crime drama because action scenes often feature several groups of characters splitting up, attacking from multiple angles, and tackling separate obstacles simultaneously. The directing makes this all coherent. Makishima’s fight scenes are pretty good as well. You can tell what is going on anatomically and the stages look nice while providing variance in methods of attack. However, there are one or two scenes with poor visual flow. The first scene is just confusing when you try to make sense of the criminals and protagonists movement in relation to each other. At one point, the bad guy randomly appears from an ally that doesn’t have any cohesion with the rest of the location, giving the impression that he teleported.\nThe character designs are good, but not amazing. The characters are attractive for the most part but their designs are taken seriously enough to match the tone of the show. They all have a few aesthetic qualities that make them more unique such as Kogami smoking, Makishima’s straight razor and the analysts sass and outfits.\nThere are some really pretty backgrounds, mostly notably the SYBIL tower (I has a name, I just don’t remember it), and the death game section of the subway system/sewer. Even in very dark settings, vibrant color is added without feeling jarring or detracting from the atmosphere. In fact, I think the brilliant use of color is the best part about the presentation of the show. It lends that futuristic cyberpunk feel across many locations. The setting of the third episode, the factory, is my least favorite because that setting lacked the aesthetic qualities present in the rest of the show. It’s also the host to some pretty cheesy moments.\nPsycho-Pass shows the interaction of several philosophies in a wonderfully detailed setting that is both believable and unique. Rather than focus on the direct integration of humans and technology, it chooses t explore the sociological and psychological effects of it's premise. I hope you enjoyed this review, now go watch Psycho-Pass.\n        "},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    There are two standards against which it's fair to measure Psycho-Pass. \nOne is the standard of the genre piece - it's a very Western show, a police procedural in a sci-fi setting partly lifted from the film Minority Report, with familiar UK/US TV hallmarks like serial killers linked behind the scenes to a mastermind who facilitates their crimes (see: Sherlock, Hannibal), brooding and obsessive detectives who are in danger of getting \"in too deep\", terrorists who want to make statements against society, etc. How exciting is it? How visceral is the action? How complex and/or surprising is the plotting? \nThe other is the standard of\n          \n        the show it often wants to be, full of references to Pascal, Weber, Foucault, Plato, and Descartes, and concerned with the profound social implications of an AI-ruled society. At various times, Psycho-Pass delves into the psychological impact of constant emotional repression in a situation where everyone who exhibits any stress is immediately shunted into therapy, the implications for safety and security on a total dependence on the Sybil AI's infallibility (taken to the extent that people don't lock their doors), and the ethics of its central premise - that people deserve to be imprisoned and isolated before they do anything wrong because an AI decided they might be dangerous. Psycho-Pass wants to say something meaningful about who we are and how we'll change as technology changes the way we live. \nOn the first standard, Psycho-Pass is largely a success. While the action is rarely innovative or as exciting as other series with a similar tone like Darker than Black, the moody cyberpunk setting and the strong characterisation of the lead trio - Akane, Shinya, and Gino - make up for it. The main strength, aside from its characters, is its confident approach to crime stories involving the detection of serial killers through analysing their crimes and hunting them with the tools available to the police - the obvious intelligence in Akane and Shinya's approach to police work elevate the procedural elements of the show above the average anime mystery show, although the mysteries are little better than mediocre in comparison to their obvious Western influences. \nBut when it tries to go beyond a well-done sci-fi detective series, it stumbles more often than it succeeds. While several major storylines, focusing on the subversion of the Sybil system or the way freedom from consequence can turn law-abiding citizens into violent criminals, demonstrate a superficially accurate understanding of human nature, Psycho-Pass rarely manages to offer any deeper or more specific insights into how people might change in response to such technology. Its ethical conflicts, specifically regarding the morality of locking people up because a scan said they were latent criminals, are rarely investigated beyond the simple answer of \"We've got to live with it, because it mostly works.\" \nA genuinely well-constructed sci-fi premise can give the viewer historical context which explains how human society evolved until reaching the present situation - who exactly introduced the Sybil system to begin with, or how Japan moved from a free-trading internationally-open state into an isolationist enclave ruled by an AI with no pretense of democratic government, or how exactly the first generation of Japanese - used to the freedom of choice in their professions and their lives - reacted when the Sybil system began controlling what jobs they were allowed to do and pushing therapy on them if their emotional state seemed fragile. \nThere's a huge gap between society right now, and the society in Psycho-Pass, and the show makes almost no attempt to explain what pushed people across the gap. Was democratic self-government with the rule of law, being judged by a jury of your peers, and the promise of being innocent until proven guilty, really such a failure that people were willing to risk being locked up for doing nothing wrong by an AI over which they had no control? Was there a war, or some massive political failure, or a revolution? What happened? While some inferences can be made - the USSR or China provide a handy examples of a society where people eventually acquiesced to having their lives centrally controlled and monitored - there's a troubling lack of explanation for why people would accept any of this when it was first introduced.\nThis central problem of implausibility becomes magnified to the point that it actively hurts the show during the final reveal in the last six-episode arc, of how the Sybil system is run, and by whom, and how it maintains itself. Almost all the revelations which come out of this final arc are pure, unadulterated nonsense, which make it genuinely baffling that society could have ever accepted the Sybil system in the first place. They can't be discussed without spoiling potential viewers, but they set a hard limit on how favourably Psycho-Pass can be judged. As a genre piece, in the context of anime, it's reliably decent and sometimes good, but as anything more than conventional entertainment, it's at best a brave failure. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=20,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Psycho Pass is a dystopian cyberpunk series created by Production I.G and written by Urobuchi Gen who you may know as the writer of Fate/Zero and Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Being overly optimistic isn't one of my failings, but I have to admit that that little fact does give me hope for this one. Let's check it out. \nOur story takes place in a futuristic Japan where everything is run by the Sybil system. The system can check the career you're best suited for and scan your brain to determine how likely you are to commit crimes. This has resulted in a society in which\n          \n        “latent” criminals are caught and separated from society before they commit crimes when possible. However, that isn't always a possibility. So a special enforcement division works to solve crimes and bring criminals in or slay them according to Sibyl's judgment. The story of Psycho Pass follows this division as of the moment young Tsunemori Akane joins as the newest inspector. The story goes through several incidents, some of which are connected in ways that aren't readily apparent, before moving to the main plot. The hunt for the enigmatic Makishima Shougo who has some responsibility for multiple criminal acts including one that's haunted one of Division 1's enforcers, Kougami Shinya. No, that isn't a spoiler. They give that much away pretty quickly. I actually have nothing negative to say about the plot. Shocking, I know. The story is well-paced. It's interesting. It has some excellent twists. The morality is questionable and forces you to really think. The ending is strong. The major themes of the “isolating age,” “emotional repression,” and the time motif are all well handled. The story is also highly engaging, challenging the viewer not only with the morality, but with various mysteries and motifs. Nothing that happens is irrelevant. It all serves a purpose either thematically or as a factor in the main narrative. Actually, most do both. The world itself is very interesting and well constructed. \nThe characters aren't quite as strong as the story. Most of them are complex and well developed. I particularly liked the fact that the story managed to make both the protagonists and major antagonists competent. It's all too common to see a crime narrative make the protagonists act like idiots so that the antagonist will look stronger until the very end when they manage to find their brains. In Psycho Pass, they all come across as intelligent and any mistakes that either side makes are understandable under the circumstances. It makes the dramatic tension and narrative all the stronger. The more minor characters still have verisimilitude and feel developed, even with the limited screen time they get. My only criticism in this area is that the antagonists lacked developed motivations. You get a basic sense of why they're doing what they're doing, but it is somewhat weak. \nThe art is really well done and nicely detailed. That being said, there is some very violent and dark content. So the series certainly isn't for everyone. The futuristic tech looks interesting, I especially liked their depiction of futuristic chat rooms, and the action sequences really flow well. The character designs are nicely varied and well done. \nThe sound in this is really excellent. The ambient sounds and background music are both effective at building atmosphere. All the actors give good performances. The overall best were probably Nojima Kenji, Hanazawa Kana and Sakurai Takahiro. Even though there aren't any weak performances, those three are excellent. \nThe ho-yay factor is a 4/10. Yayoi and Shion are romantically involved, although you don't see much of their relationship. There's some in Yayoi's backstory and there's a case where they go to a girl's school which has some. \nThat was Psycho Pass. How does it compare to Urobuchi's other works? Well, it isn't quite as strong as Madoka, but it's stronger than Fate/Zero. It's a very interesting piece with a lot of depth, strong characters, a developed world and it ranks among the best dystopian works. My final rating for it is an excellent 9/10. I would recommend seeing it under the caveat that it does have quite a bit of violence, some of which is sexual. If that's going to be triggering or a general problem for you, you should not watch it. That isn't to say that it's handled badly, it's not. It's well-handled and respectful. Still, you don't want to expose yourself to that if you can't handle it. Next week, Watashi ga Motenai no wa dō Kangaetemo Omaera ga Waru... I'm just going to call it Watamote. \n        "},

Dick's classic dystopian masterpiece Minority Report and have Urobuchi at the helm? Actually, a really kickass anime! If you are currently going through mystery show withdrawal after finishing HBO's True Detective or BBC's Sherlock and need more to get your fix, Psycho Pass has got you covered!\nStory: 10/10\nThe story takes place in a dystopian future where a program called the Sibyl system makes all of your decisions for you including your job, what you are going to eat, and pretty much everything else. People don't have any stress because they never have to\n          \n        think or have any free will at all. If you do become stressed though, the system sees you as a threat and a potential criminal in the future. You are arrested and either executed to prevent any future crimes you may commit or you can join the police and hunt down other criminals like a crime dog under the command of an elite officer that rules over you like a slave master. Crime, suicide, poverty, disease, and war are all low, but this future honestly kind of sucks! Now our squad of detectives must hunt down an enigmatic figure that is helping others commit crimes and get away with it. A criminal consultant for hire. Will our guys and gals in blue be able to stop this madman!?\nCharacters: 10/10\nThe characters is Psycho Pass are all excellent. Firstly, you have Akane Tsunemori who defies gender stereotypes and anime cliches. She is a highly competent detective with a genius IQ. She could have done anything, but chose to become a detective above all else. She has a very strong sense of justice and a kind heart, but she is also logical and not blinded by idealism. She knows for example that even a corrupt and terrible system can't simply be torn down overnight and replaced with nothing if millions of people are dependent on that system. This puts her practical wisdom far above the likes of Daenerys Targaryen or either of America's last 2 presidents. Another character is Shinya Kogami, who is a human hound dog bent on solving the murder of his partner and chasing the responsible party to the gates of hell. Shinya can seem cold and harsh, especially in episode 1, but he grows as a character and Akane is able to restore some of his humanity. The villain is the ever delightful Shogo Makishima, who is like Johan Liebert from Monster had a love child with Jim Moriarty from BBC's Sherlock. I mention this particular adaptation of the Moriarty character because the whole \"criminal consultant\" thing was likely lifted directly from this series. The rest of the support cast as great as well, but I won't describe them all here.\nArt: 9/10\nThe art in this series is spectacular. The characters and environments look great, the animation is fluid and smooth, and those guns are fucking awesome!\nSound: 8/10\nThe soundtrack is quite good. It isn't the greatest soundtrack in anime history in my opinion, but it is very solid and gets the job done! Bonus points for the well done use of classical music, especially Makishima's love of Beethoven's 9th Symphony. Because it is never a bad time for a Clockwork Orange reference!\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nThis series was extremely enjoyable and very addicting. Especially after Makishima is introduced. This will have you on the edge of your seat and also make you think a bit as well. It is rare when a series can combine adrenaline pumping action with great characters and thought provoking writing. \nOverall: 10/10\nThis is an absolute masterpiece! If you haven't seen it yet, go out and watch it! The writing is top notch, the characters are great, the suspense and action are great, and it combines entertainment with honestly pretty decent artistic aesthetics. The first couple episodes may throw off a few viewers, but I recommend at least giving it until Makishima shows up to decide if this series is for you."},

Both stories were set in the futuristic setting focused on special police force, both tried to raise a philosophical and moral questions, both shows grim/dark atmosphere of the near future. (or maybe not so near one)\nGhost in the Shell focused on borderlines of humanity in the world where technology allowed human and machine to became one.\nPsycho-pass focuses on whatever is morally right to isolate people, separate or eliminate people haven't committed any crimes because of their potential to do\n          \n        so, just because technology allows us to foresee something which may or may not happen. \nBasically, Psycho-pass is partly a copy/paste of \"Minority Report\" with a few differences. \nIn Psycho-pass, we have all seeing computer system called Sybil constantly measuring and judging people's emotions, skills or desires, providing a overall analysis who is or isn't mentally healthy and subsequently have a potential to commit a crime. Those deemed mentally unhealthy are called \"latent criminal\" and system dispatches a special forces called Enforces to deal with them. Those \"latent criminals\" which can't be \"cured\" are isolated. Irony of things is, some of the Enforcers are actually a so called \"latent criminals\" destined to serve a hunting dogs, criminals hunting other criminals, while being constantly kept on the leash by so called Inspectors. \nWhy I am focusing on describing this so much?\nBecause this is main thing which defines both story, it's characters and internal motives/feeling/development of said characters and thanks to this, story and characters are not flat, while they aren't that unique. \nOf course, in addition to above, there are plenty of action packed scenes which will keep you from being bored. While story does not lack violence, it's not trying to be overly gory and do not really rely on rivers of blood to create dark atmosphere.\nArtwork is pretty good and helps to create the bit of a horror feeling, music also fits the genre.\nOverall rating and enjoyment are great for me so far ...

Statistically speaking, Sybil was a great system for creating a stable and harmonious society. The only people screwing it up were essentially narcissists who wished to impose their own version or reality + terrorism on the general populace. This plus the IMO realistic interpretation of the future of the internet made up for a lot of the other issues that would have dragged this to an 8 on my list.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Short Version\nPsycho-Pass is an Action, Fantasy, Sci-Fi anime that uses the concept of a world where your mental state is always being checked and finding criminals is easy, until someone beats the system and wants the same system that society depends on destroyed. The story is one of complex but pleasing stories ever made, how the unlikely partnership of Akame and Kogami tries to save the system but not everything is what is seen to be and the rivalry between Kogami and Antagonist is the most interesting part of the story . It’s dark, sharp art style and animations makes the fight scenes and its\n          \n        art design overall visually beautiful. The voice acting real complements Psycho-Pass’ excellently, making one of the most satisfying aspects of the show. Psycho-pass is a must watch, as it won't disappoint you and it has one of the most interesting story–lines i seen in a long time and i would recommend Psycho-Pass to anyone looking for a good story to enjoy. \nFull Version \nPsycho-Pass is an Action, Fantasy, Sci-Fi anime created by Production I.G., written by Gen Urobuchi and directed by Naoyoshi Shiotani.\nPlot\nThe plot of the anime is set in the year 2113; Japan uses The Sibyl System, a system that can actively measure a person's mental state, their personality and the probability of them committing a crime, by using Cymatic scans of a person's brain. The Crime Coefficient, a measurement of the probability of a person committing a crime, gets too high, the person in question this then called a latent Criminal that then gets pursued by the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal investigation Division's Inspectors and Enforcers to be apprehended to retrieve treatment or to be killed if there Crime Coefficient is too high to be treated. The Public Safety Bureau's Criminal investigation Division is made up of special teams that uses latent criminals that can't lower there Crime Coefficient enough to return to be redeemed that they won't commit a crime but not high enough to be killed, as enforcers to hunt down other latent criminals and Inspectors, whose job is to make sure that enforcers do their job and stop them from escaping. These teams use a weapon called Dominators, a handgun that can do a Cymatic scan on the person that it aimed at. If the person's Crime Coefficient is low enough then the gun can't be fired on them, if it's higher than is acceptable, it will stun the person when fired and if it's too high, it will kill the person if fired. \nMain Characters\nMain Female Protagonist - Akane Tsunemori (Voiced by Kana Hanazawa) - She is a new inspector of unit one of The Public Safety Bureau's Criminal investigation Division. She has a calm demeanor, strong sense of justice and doesn't like to kill latent criminals if they can be saved by using treatment. I find her character very interesting because of her sense of right and wrong, and she treats enforcers like people, not hunting dogs like most inspectors.\nMain Male Protagonist- Shinya Kogami (Voiced by Tomokazu Seki) - He is one of the enforcers in unit one. He unlike Akane is not afraid to act even if it breaks the law system to stop criminals so no one has to worry about increasing their Crime Coefficient and become a latent criminal. Kogami is a well-made character, he's partnership with Akane shows that while they share and work together the same goals, they don't compromise each other’s ideals as both of them think their own ideals are right. Also Kogami's rivalry with the Antagonist, is very interesting as each are willing to do anything to achieve their own goals and their understanding of each other.\nMain Antagonist - ????? (Voiced by Takahiro Sakurai) - He is determined to rid the world of The Sybil System, because spoilers i can't say why but it very complex and makes sense.\nPresentation\nPsycho-Pass uses a very sharp and dark color scheme that draws viewers into its world of anguish and helps show the symbolism of the horror that Akane is forced to endure all though the story. The focus on the character's personalities is great as it makes the viewer interested in the story more. The animation of the characters are beautiful as they move so smoothly and so life like as best shown in the action scenes making them some of the best parts of the anime. The voice acting of the characters are well done, specially The Antagonist as he sounds so calm but scary as he can sound the same while killing people. The music is helps the feel of the anime and some pieces well as it really fit with what going on screen.\nMy Opinion\nPsycho-Pass is one of these anime that's story is so interesting because of being so complex and not everything is black and white. The way Kogami and the Antagonist's rivalry works is amazing, the way they can understand each other and how each other won't back down. The way the world works is interesting but also scary because of once you Crime Coefficient gets too high, your life is over.\nVerdict\nPsycho-Pass is one of those anime that are a must watch as it has so much complexity. Its world shows one of the possible futures of our own world and a scary one at that. I recommend anyone who loves a good story to give Psycho-Pass a try and you won't be disappointed."},

The messages are strong, clear, and memorable. \nStory 10/10\nThe principal theme that the show explored was the question of what is justice. We tend to believe that it's difficult or impossible to define \"justice\", but this show seems to want to give you a clear answer of what it really is. Of course the creators acknowledge that it isn't that\n          \n        simple, because on one hand there are people like Shougo Makishima who challenge the society through violence, and on the other hand there are people like Shinya Kougami who push their ideals through selfish reasons like vengeance, which leads to more crime. On the surface, their action seems more or less to be driven by justice. Justice isn't always fair and kind, so people seem to learn to live with it and sometimes don't realize how much they become manipulated by it. With that kind of imperfect justice predominating over the world, no wonder it would seem impossible to create a future devoid of war and crime. In the world of Psycho-Pass, the Sibyl system sought to correct those very difficult issues simply by rooting out all injustice before it emerges in public, the very act of which ironically led to its own corruption. In the end, there is something to be learned:\n\"Laws aren't just made to protect the people, but they're also made to be protected. People always detested evil and sought out a righteous way of living. Their feelings… The accumulation of those people’s feelings are the law.\"\nRead more: http://animequotes.net/psycho-pass-quotes#ixzz2g3zgRDEl\nArt 8/10\nI noticed that some scenes were getting really sloppy in showing the characters' facial expressions. Sometimes these glitches were so major that the facial features looked different on every cut. \nThe animators had some really great ideas about how to best show the futuristic setting (cyborgs, handle-less cars etc.) and it made me feel as if the world could really turn into the same mess in 100 years. \nSound 8/10\nAs great as people thought the opening themes were, I didn't feel much from the lyrics. They sounded as if the lyricist had strung up some words that were borderline-relevant to the theme of the show. I suppose that they were borderline relevant, but I don't see very much deep logic in what the songs wanted to convey. \nOn the other hand, the ED themes were very satisfying (despite the amazing fact that they were both written primarily as a continuation of a story from another show and that their relevance to psycho-pass was only secondary). The 1st ED captures the feeling of latent criminals, while the 2nd ED shifts to the opposite perspective of those whose mission is to protect the latent criminals (e.g., akane, yayoi, etc.). The two songs were very strong in message, so they add more impact to the show. \nI have no complaints about the bgms and sound effects since the industry is good at this these days. \nCharacter 10/10\nI remember that during the very first episode Akane and Masaoka were having this conversation about how impractical it would be for Akane to maintain the theories and logics that she'd gained during her early training due to the \"unlogical\" nature of their job. That conversation ended with Akane answering, \"But I...\" She was stopped mid-sentence, but I always wondered what she was going to say after that if she hadn't been stopped because already at that point it showed the strength of her character. \nI think that scene alone gave me a pretty good idea about what kind of person that she was and was going to be. This anime is just really good at developing the characters through those subtle scenes and conversations.\nEnjoyment 10/10\nFor me the greatest enjoyment came from the feeling of doubt emerging bit by bit as I continued with the show. For some reason at first the Sibyl system just seemed to be too good to be true and little by little I found out why it was so. I think that the creators wanted you to doubt the events within the story so that you could be a participant to the unveiling of mystery. \nOverall 10/10 \nI think it would be fun to compare this show with some other series of Urobuchi, because there are themes other than the depressing mood that make it a typical Urobuchi show. Whether or not a fan of Urobuchi, you will probably enjoy the show if you are willing to give a few minutes on each episode to think about the issue of crime and justice and how it all connects to our society\n"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=19,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    [IN A NUTSHELL] Psycho-Pass offers a dark and intense crime-fighting storyline, set in a futuristic city with questionable technology, with overarching philosophical banter amongst pretty bishonen characters on what's right and wrong, on whether it's okay for supercomputers judge what it means to be human and so forth, all encased in wonderful artwork and semi-trance music. \nSTORY (7): The premise of the story is BOTH the strength and weakness of this anime. The idea of 'stopping crime before it happens' has already been explored and thoroughly loved/worshipped in Philip K. Dick's \"Minority Report.\" Outdoing it would be like \"Hunger Games\" trying to outdo \"Battle Royale.\"\n          \n        The death-match rivalry between Shinya Kogami and Shogo Makishima also mirrors dangerously close to the overdone example of the 'eccentric detective' (ie. Sherlock Holmes) versus the 'criminal mastermind' (ie. James Moriarty). Solid formula? Definitely. Original? Not entirely.\nThe story isn't completely still-water, however. Eleven episodes in, the anime clearly presents a well-paced sequence of events with smooth action scenes and great cliffhangers. The transition between frames are brilliant and easy to follow. The dialogues aren't cheesy nor do they spoon feed us with information. Many things are still left unsaid, keeping us interested. \nPersonally, I hope to see more of how exactly the Sibyl system works, the logistics behind it and all that nitty-gritty details. The story needs to break off from the overdone formulas and deliver something unexpected (and/or psychologically more unsettling). The potential is definitely there and there are many more questions to be answered. I'm waiting for the next episode, so it's been a hit for me so far. \nART (10): Amano Akira sensei, creator of the immensely popular Katekyo Hitman Reborn! series, attempts a more mature twist to her style in the Psycho-Pass series. (Think TYL-counterparts in sketchy neighborhoods, under dimly lit warehouses and impossibly tall and abstract skyscrapers) Her clean and visually appealing style is surprisingly well-adapted to the more grungy and grotesque feel in Psycho-Pass. Seriously, everything looks so polished. Also, kudos to the I.G. Production team, who also produced \"Ghost in the Shell.\" It's in good hands.\nCHARACTER (7): Physically, they resemble the Reborn! characters, which isn't particularly a bad thing. Kogami Shinya looks like the lovechild between Hibari Kyoya and Yamamoto Takeshi, Tsunemori Akane is a less annoying version of Miura Haru, and Makishima Shogo could easily be Rokudo Mukuro possessing Byakuran in a parallel universe. Personality-wise, they are also pretty archetypical so far. The protagonist is an outcast who seeks revenge (as well as redemption), the good-natured heroine is sadly still quite useless, and the villain (anti-hero?) is the untouchable genius who prefers not to get his own hands dirty. Again, the potential is there to make these characters more interesting in the future episodes. Psycho-Pass definitely has better female characters than Reborn, but not by a big margin. Personally, I enjoy the resemblance.\nSOUND (8): The music fits the futuristic and enigmatic tone of the story. It was slightly unsettling at first, especially the OP, but it grows on you.\nENJOYMENT (8)\nOVERALL (8): When you read Psycho-Pass in katakana, it's the same pronunciation as Psychopath. Maybe that's what they're getting at. You know, that we all have a little bit of crazy in us. \n        "},

While all sorts of inclinations are recorded and policed, these measured numbers used to judge people’s souls are commonly called ‘Psycho Pass.’\"\nPsycho-Pass has the most interesting and revolutionary premise of any anime I've ever seen. It's comparable to that of The Matrix or Texhnolyze. Simply better than The Matrix and about as interesting as Texhnolyze. Except Texhnolyze didn't emphasize its premise much. In this review, I will make short comments on the execution of the anime and focus primarily on the ramifications of the premise.\nThe execution in this anime\n          \n        is average at best. The characters are sometimes interesting but not particularly well written. It looks and sounds meh. Given, I did not see the extended version which is supposed to fix some of these issues I had with the anime. Now to the interesting part, the premise:\nWhat does a world look like where the government can look into your soul and determine your \"crime coefficient?\" In Psycho-Pass, there are street scanners that can determine individuals stress levels, or \"hue.\" The police have guns that measure your probability to commit a crime, or \"crime coefficient.\" This gun, or \"dominator,\" determines your crime coefficient and your probability of rehabilitation. If it determines that you are not likely to commit a crime, it locks the trigger. If it decides you can recover and \"lighten your hue,\" then it activates under \"non-lethal paralyzer mode.\" And if it determines you are not likely to rehabilitate, it activates under \"lethal eliminator mode.\" The implications of that should scare any human being with little to no explanation. There are two sides to that horror. The side that the main character Akane Tsunemori sees and existentially struggles to accept, and the side where we look at how close that reality is to our own.\nI will talk about Akane, but I will only spoil the first episode so I don't feel like adding a big spoiler warning. I will also talk about other aspects of the anime in vague terms as to not spoil anything. If you don't see a problem with the premise becoming a reality, the anime sure highlights it for you in the first episode. On Akane's first day on the job she is tasked with finding a stock crazy dude holding an innocent girl hostage. Stock crazy guy rapes girl before being caught and killed by the dominator. When they find the girl, the dominator tells them that her crime coefficient is too high and that she is a \"target for enforcement.\" She is so traumatized that the gun activates in lethal eliminator mode. What did this girl do in order to deserve execution? That is primarily the dilemma with proactive law enforcement. It punishes people before they actually commit any crime. Sure, the raped girl probably wanted to kill her rapist, but how is that not to be expected? That does not make her a criminal, not in today's view of ethics. She will most likely not become a criminal from her trauma, nor will she become a threat to society. But her mind state is so shaken up at the moment, that any psychological, or \"Psycho-Pass\" analysis will tell you she's not okay. Another issue with this approach comes about judging psychopaths, or people that do not believe that they're doing anything bad when committing a crime. Look up Gary Leon Ridgway, a man who killed 48 women and passed all forms of lie detector tests and multiple interrogations. \"If you put him in a room with 20 other people you would not be able to pick him out as anything out of the ordinary.\" The dominator would give these people a low crime coefficient, even as they kill someone. These people would then be immune to the law, being unable to get picked up by street scanners and would never be a subject for enforcement. The last pointed out issue with this system comes about the influence of knowledge or other people being able to influence other's crime coefficient. There is a character who used to be a teacher until he started turning all of his students into \"latent criminals,\" people with high crime coefficients that have not committed a crime. Not to mention the effect of studying and catching criminals would have on law enforcement's crime coefficients. In order to catch a criminal you need to be able to empathize and understand them in order to predict their actions through their motives. Empathizing with a criminal is not much different from becoming one. \nThe truly terrifying realization I had with this premise however, was how close our reality and our government is to becoming that of Psycho-Pass. I'll go through each point I brought up above and compare them to our system. If someone suffers serious trauma, what exactly happens to that individual? If they're messed up enough they end up locked up in an insane asylum (or Mental Health facility), which by the way exist in Psycho-Pass kind of the same as they are now. He is restrained from society, locked up as if they themselves were criminals. Next, psychopaths. Psychopaths pass lie detector tests and fool law enforcement on a day to day basis. Lastly, take a close look at what solitary confinement actually means. Look at the case of the Man in the Iron Mask. This next exact quote is from Wikipedia, though I have cross-referenced it with multiple sources which I am too lazy to find quotes from. \"Louvois instructed Saint-Mars to prepare a cell with multiple doors, one closing upon the other, which were to prevent anyone from the outside listening in. Saint-Mars himself was to see Dauger only once a day to provide food and whatever else he needed. Dauger was also to be told that if he, Dauger, spoke of anything other than his immediate needs he would be killed.\" These extreme criminals are not allowed to talk or communicate with others. Sure, it's usually because they broke some rule of their imprisonment, but the effect is the same. These criminals are not allowed to influence others into committing crimes, e.g. rioting, etc.\nHowever, the only road to this premise is through technology. We already have one aspect of this premise being used effectively in our society. Street scanners. Sure, right now they can only be used to give people tickets for passing red lights, but how is that any different? This posted machine records you without human input and determines whether or not you are a target for enforcement. How does it know if you were forced into crossing the red light? Maybe your brakes aren't very good or your vehicle is overloaded and can't brake fast. Maybe the guy behind you was really on you and if you stopped you would've gotten in an accident. The machine doesn't care about your circumstances. I already mentioned lie detector tests, but they're another great example. Think about this: If the police had a 100% lie detector test and asked you if you wanted to kill someone, what would happen if you said yes? That's the same as measuring your Psycho-Pass. If law enforcement had dominators, they would most certainly use them. The only thing keeping us from that reality, is the government's lack of technology. \nFinal thoughts: Psycho-Pass successfully presents an extraordinary premise to us using its medium. Its not well done like Texhnolyze, but its good enough to really emphasize and take full advantage of the ethical implications of its premise. Psycho-Pass is an absolute must watch for anyone slightly interested in the philosophy of law enforcement and ethics. It's hard to imagine someone that wouldn't enjoy watching it. \n        "},

There is a split portrayal similar to The Great Gatsby with the inspector/enforcer relationship that was interesting to watch and a psychological chase not as intensive as Death Note but still of good quality.\nEvery episode and plot development and crime pokes at the very basis of society, there are plots to undermine that society, as well as struggles to realize the worth of protecting said society after its true form comes to light.  Psycho Pass's charm and very existence relies on the world it tries strongly to portray and it does so with episodes of substance, a small enough number of unique characters, a main antagonist that forms the backbone of the overarching plot, good animation, and several other elements that are well done (action, drama, psychological/philosophical, and deductive reasoning).  If you're interested in the exploration of the theoretical world, this anime is for you~\n        "},

Personally I felt that the first season of Psycho Pass excelled in the first area, but then fell just short of the mark on the second two. \nThrough out the series, I always felt like i wanted to know more about each character and, with a couple of exceptions, I wasn't wholly satisfied with what I received. I felt like there where missed opportunities for character development that would have helped to solidify the story line. \nAs for the plot,  I love\n          \n        the concept and found it very entertaining, I watched all 22 episodes in 3 days. Despite this, I did feel like to much was being crammed into some parts, while I found other parts very slow. I was unsure of whether the ending would do the story justice and honestly I think it did. \nHowever by far my favourite part of this anime was the sound track.  I never skipped the openings or endings and each track added something to the scene it was playing over. I will diffidently be listening to this ost as I study for collage. \nTo sum up, I would recommence Psycho Pass to anyone who feels that the can get their head round a complex story line that keeps you on your toes and that isn't to bothered about character development. The art style is beautiful and there are some stunning moments towards the end that really show of the talent of the animators and artists. Over all I would rate this anime 7 out of 10.      "},

It is by-and-far the best anime of 2013. It's an amazing anime with great visuals, a unique story, brilliant characters and hands-down one of the best anime in the mystery genre out there. It is, a masterpiece... Almost.\n\nStory:- 10/10\n(a)Premise: The story of Psycho-Pass takes place in a futuristic world where everything is controlled by a system called the \"Sybil\" system. All humans now depend on this system, to make any of their \"life\" decisions. This, in turn, affects the crime system of the world. Now people are judged to be a criminal by their\n          \n        mental state. If a person's mental state crosses a specific limit, they are considered to be parallel.\n(b)Originality: The story of Psycho-Pass is one of the most original stories  ever presented in any anime. The story masterfully confronts problems with human nature. It also highlights the problems of humans depending on technology too much.\n(c)Pacing:The story does take some time to get moving, but if the watcher has some patience, then the story in perfectly paced.\nIt has a minimal amount of time skips and completely explains everything to the user, without making the user feeling spoon-fed, or bored.\n(d)Ending: The ending is the only part of Psycho-Pass' story which I find \"average\". The ending is definitely unsatisfactory. But seeing as there is a new season coming in the October of 2014, it probably won't stay that way for long.\n\nArt and Animation:- 9/10\n(a)Art: Production I.G. was the animation studio for Psycho-Pass. This studio was responsible for the animation of Shingeki no Kyojin, Prince of Tennis, Kuroko's Basket, Guilty Crown. So one can clearly tell that the art will be amazing. But in the case of Psycho-Pass, the art isn't good, it's brilliant. The art in Psycho-Pass is extremely realistic. The world is designed as a dark place, coated with a beautiful exterior.\n(b)Animation: There isn't too much \"stand-out\" animation in Psycho-Pass.  The animation isn't bad per-say, but it it's merely average. Aside from the many action scenes scattered throughout the series.\n(c)Character Design: The characters of Psycho-Pass are all very well-designed and are very realistic. Aside from the female lead, Akane Tsunemori. As you'll hear from most of the people who have seen this show, she looks like she's permanently \"stoned\". The rest of the characters are all very well designed, and although all of them look normal, they still look unique in there own right.\n\nSound:- 7/10\n(a)Soundtrack: The sound director of Psycho-Pass is Yugo Kanno, who's a newcomer to the world of anime soundtracks. And this is definitely not going to be his best work. The soundtrack does definitely compliment the setting of the show, which is \"Sci-Fi\". It also uses many famous symphonies from Ludwig van Beethoven and Achille-Claude Debussy. But the soundtrack itself isn't very good. Aside from a few tracks the entire OST is nothing special.\n(b)Openings and Endings: The second opening of the show is the better one of the two. The endings are not too good.\n(c)Sub and Dub: Between the subbed version and the dubbed version, the subbed is definitely more recommended. While most of the voices in the dubbed version are good, the voice of the main antagonist(Makashima) and the main female lead(Akane) are unbearably cliche in the dubbed version. Plus, Makashima's voice in the subbed version is amazing.\n\nCharacters:-10/10\n(a)Main Characters: The main characters are the best part of Psycho-Pass. There are 3 main characters.\nShinya Kougami: He's the main \"protagonist\" of the series. He's a detective, and a damn good one at that. His character could've been a little better developed, but honestly, he didn't need much more development.\nMakashima Shougo: He's the main antagonist of the entire series. He is the best of any character in the series. He's a smart bastard with a sadistic sense of \"humor\". He's introduced towards the beginning of the series, and is perfectly developed throughout the show. His character is one who can easily control his mental state easily, and his ideals are one's some people can agree with. He easily manipulates multiple people and considers Kougami his rival. Every second he's on screen is a moment of pure elegance.\nAkane Tsunemori: Akane his the most controversial character of the series, specifically because she looks like she's permanently high. The story is seen through mainly her eyes. She acts as a sort-of P.O.V. camera for the series. She is also developed very well throughout the show.\n(b)Side Characters: There is a gigantic list of side characters in Psycho-Pass. And every character is amazing. Every last one of the characters is treated with proper respect by the show. Each one gets a decent amount of screentime and are developed very well.\n\nEnjoyment:-9/10\nThe show keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat throughout the entire show. There are a multiple number of plot-twists in the show as well as great action scenes. \nOverall the story has great pacing, characters and art. The only place for improvement is in the sound. The setting is brilliant and unique beyond belief and the dub is better than average.\nOverall: 9.0/10.0\n        "},

This only has action of those three, and not as a main characteristic. Even so, if you care about the story the most, then it is a must watch.\nStory = 10\nThis series is what got me into following Gen Urobuchi's works and then tracking down Fate/Zero and Madoka. From the start it showed to be about something more than a shallow story with a hero saving the day. Somehow, the dialog between Shogo Makishima and Shinya Kogami right at the start got me\n          \n        hooked instantly. I probably should add that I usually drop anime series like crazy, maybe even under ten minutes during the first episode. I can't say whether it hooked me because it's that good or because it just happened to have what I was looking for at the moment, but what I can say for certain is that I don't regret watching all of it.\nThe basic premise is that in the future Japan in which these characters live, everything's controlled by the government. Something called the Sybil System was implemented before the main character Akane Tsunemori was born. This system watches over everything and also decides what path in life people should take according to different examinations. Put shortly, it's a society of control cranked up to eleven.\nIn this system soon enough emerges someone that can't be picked up by scanners, or rather, whose psycho-pass doesn't go up.\nThis person is trying to destroy the system and becomes very dangerous very fast.\nBe ready, though, because Gen Urobuchi's known for kicking people in the feels and this is no exception.\nSuch a big premise could turn to shit extremely easily all things considered, but the writing is impressively well done. Especially the interaction between the characters.\nSomeone once told me that the climax happened to early but I disagree completely, and think that the climax was a fakeout in order to let a bigger climax take place later, which worked wonders.\nTL;DR: Incredible story.\nThe art's score to me is a 10, from the beautiful designs that Akira Amano made, to the amazing (albeit rare) animation in the action scenes. Hell, they even gave Ko a real martial art called Pencak Silat and animated it beautifully. I ended up rewatching a lot of this because of how engaging it is in every aspect. Even the OP videos are wonderful, with a lot of color and style.\nRanging from composition to color theory to contrast, this show is pure eye candy.\nThe sound would be higher than a 9 to me if it had more memorable BGM tracks. Sadly, other than the track called Psycho-Pass in the OST, there's really nothing I remember off the top of my head. That being said, as background music, it's perfect. It sets the mood exactly the way it should and never feels out of place. The OP's are both great, especially the second one. The ED's are both by Egoist so I guess I don't even need to say how nice they are.\nAbout the voice acting, this is one of those rare cases where I hate the English localization because of how lazy the casting felt. The Japanese version is lovely, so no worries there. Every character gets the voice they should have, and the most prominent ones show an incredible range of emotions.\nThe sound effects for the dominators and the machines are spot on, too.\nIt's a shame that the soundtrack didn't have anything memorable.\nThe characters, though, are probably what allowed the crazy-ambitious premise to truly shine. They get a full 10 from me.\nAkane Tsunemori starts off as a total newbie and seeing her develop and grow up as she learns from Kogami is really inspiring, especially to me as a writer. The easy-to-shake-up girl from the start is nothing like the hardened badass that's shown in the final episodes. Her development is really nice.\nBy the way, her design is what I believe to be perfect. She might have gotten a lot of shit for looking adorable in a dark, mature story, but the idea was to introduce someone idealistic into this world and then slowly make her grow up. It worked so well nobody has a right to bitch...\nShinya Kogami steals the show, though. Even if Akane is one of my favorite characters of all time, he's even higher on that list. From his well fleshed out past to the way he's unpredictable and fascinating all the same, and how he's a complete kick ass guy both physically and intellectually that I can see anyone looking up to, everything about him made me summarize him as what every main character should be like. Besides, he gets Ichiro Miyata's voice. That alone should be enough to make him the best xp\nShogo Makishima on the other hand, is extremely effective as an antagonistic force. Just as fascinating as Kogami, yet somehow his lethal enemy. The chemistry between them was pulled off perfectly and the way they understand each other yet also understand that it can't end in anything other than either killing the other is chilling. He's one of the few villains I've ever rooted for, and that thought is especially jarring considering that I was rooting for him while I also wanted Kogami to come out victorious. When it's hard to decide who should win between the two main opposing forces in a story, I can tell it's good.\nThe rest of the cast, from the enforcers and the other inspector Ginoza to Makishima's underlings like Choe Go Sung, also were very well done. I still remember the conversations between Makishima and Choe Go Sung, and I'm not used to seeing villains being interesting. They are often just being smug. These bad guys definitely reminded me of other good villains like Kirei Kotomine and Gilgamesh from Fate/Zero (what a coincidence with the writer being the same guy).\nGinoza should probably get a mention, being that his development is excellent and he feels like a real person, probably more than anyone else in the cast. The writer really knows what he's doing when it comes to characters.\nI didn't see the point of dedicating a full episode to the enforcer girl (I even forgot her name since she's so boring) because I would have rather seen an episode on Kagari's past but even then, it didn't bother me that much. That girl (was the name Kunizuka? I can't remember) is the only character I found bland, but I can't fault that considering that she had to be there anyways.\nTL;DR: The characters are impressively well done, even the villains, save for that enforcer girl that lurks there in the background. PS don't get attached.\nEnjoyment gets a 9 solely because I would have liked to see a few more fights. Being an animation geek, things like Fate/stay night  are irresistible to me. This was like a very close albeit fully realistic equivalent. I really needed more of Kogami's ass kicking, and I didn't get it, sadly. The story's pacing is so good that the episodes fly by before I realize it and then it's five in the morning. I couldn't stress enough how well done the story telling is in this.\nIf you watch episode one and it doesn't strike you as your thing, it's most likely not your thing. For the overthinkers like me that love philosophy and rants about the human condition, this is a complete treat.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    This will be a very short review, i don't want to spoil anything, although there are many full reviews out there so read them if you want to :)\nStory (9)\nThe story itself is very well designed, although i didn't like the main idea of it. The way that story flows is sometimes boring, sometimes too fast but it kinda levels itself to the point, where you will not notice unless you're a dedicated anime viewer like myself. Details within the story are sufficient, there aren't any noticible dead ends if i may put it that way. If you like action, crime investigation and mystery, you\n          \n        are probably going to like this anime.\nArt (9)\nThere aren't many things to be said about the art. It's almost perfect, some geometry isues when flying or driving a car, but details and tectures are very realistic, the flames and explosions are deacent, soo i will not complain about the art. One anime, that deserves 10/10 for art is for example Sword art online. I liked the idea of holograms, future tech stuff etc. Very good\nSound (8)\nI've watched alot of anime and i can tell, that this sound quality is somewhat average. I watched an HD version so the sound was really good, but nothing to impresive. Sound effects are okay, very well timed, voice acting was good. I didn't like the helicopter sound very much, it was just cheap. that's what makes the story better. In conclusion, alltogether the sound was great, but some of the sound effects were cheap.\nCharacter (9)\nKogami was very good, the role he was playing was somewhat similar to the L's in the Death note, i really liked him and didn't like the fact he seperated from the rest of the team. It was logical but still. Tsunemori was the one i really liked becaused she progresed as a character though the anime. At the end, she kind of took the role from Kogami but again, that is self explanatory. Other characters were okay, nobody was left out, i wish they would introduce the Makishima more but it was okay the way it was. Alltogether, the characters were really good, but not quite 10/10.\nEnjoyment (10)\nI took my time to watch the whole anime and didn't just eat it in one day on 2 times the speed. i really enjoyed every last minute of it and at the end, i got that empy felling that i get after a good anime soo i will give it a 10/10. Excelent!\nOverall (10) \nIf i would count the average of the scores that i've given to this anime, it would be a solid 9. But the thing i care for the most is enjoyment and even if the anime itself wasn't perfect and i still enjoyed, it deffinetly deserves a 10.\n\nI recomend watching, it's one of the top 5 anime, that i watched. Also check my profile, i have a long list of anime I plan to watch, maybe YOU will find something for yourself there. Enjoy.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="                          \n    Psycho Pass’s high ambitions and dark, fascinating dystopia are let down by  sloppy plot structure and flat characters.\nSTORY (7/10):\n     The concept of Psycho Pass isn't anything too new. The idea of arresting people before they perform the crime has been done well before (Ex: Spielberg’s Minority Report). However, Psycho Pass does a great job of raising other issues and social commentary such as isolation from society and trying to control your feelings with the loss of free will. Interestingly, the show brings up novels such as Gulliver’s Travels to support its ideas. However, at times this led the show to\n          \n        feel a little full of itself and pretentious due to overly long monologues by the villain. Sometimes its best when a show actually shows, not tells. \n      The world in Psycho Pass in interesting in how almost everything is grey. The “heroes” protect the system that essentially controls and strips people of free will. The “villains” want to expose and rid this system through extreme methods, but in doing so leaves citizens in utter chaos. Taking the grey route can confuse viewers as at times I had no idea what the show wanted me to root for. But I guess that's just part of the experience.\n     The pacing in Psycho Pass is quite erratic. The show starts of episodic which was okay for the most part. Their purpose I guess was to show of the denominator’s abilities and scream Kogami is a genius! (More on that later) After that, the show finally gets focused on the main plot. Thankfully, this main plot is much more interesting and engaging. The same however can’t be said for the plot structure. The show reveals its secrets and reaches its climax way too early making the rest of the six episodes underwhelming, slow, and bland in comparison. The second climax was anti-climatic and simply begging for a sequel. \nCHARACTERS (6/10):\n     Our main protagonist Akane Tsunemori is definitely the best character in the show. Her development from a naive rookie to a hardened inspector is a believable and fascinating. The hardships she goes through have a severe impact on her personality but also serves to make her stronger and smarter. The decision to avoid a romance between her and Kogami worked as it led to a believable relationship that didn't feel too forced upon.\n     As for Kogami, he’s pretty much a stoic character. He starts as a man bent on revenge and stays that way. This left no room for development and ended up rather frustrating. I also find it hard to believe he’s the only person capable of solving most of the cases on his own. I felt he was hogging the spotlight from other Enforcers who clearly looked capable and in need of development. \n     As for the rest of the team, they were likable but there really wasn't much to them. They were forgettable for the most part. You had your flirty analyst, lighthearted comic relief, and honest father figure. They tried to put a background story for one of the side characters, but it was eventually pointless as the outcomes that occurred in that flashback never really seemed to matter. One notable exception to the side characters was Inspector Ginoza who was surprisingly a great character. Throughout the series, you can feel the internal battle inside of him deciding who’s to trust and who not to trust. His pessimistic personality and conflicted stress compliment his character and his development felt natural.\n      The villain was underwhelming and pretentious. He seems a bit similar to the Joker as both are anarchist and revert to extreme methods. For what could have been a brilliant, memorable character resulted in a preachy, overly evil character and not much else. \nANIMATION (7/10):\n     The animation for Psycho Pass is quite impressive. The CGI was well done and blended well with the 2D style. The dominator design looked cool and the transformation animation was always a joy to watch. The style is brooding and fits very well with the dystopian theme. The darkness of the show was indeed atmospheric and added to the scenery although it sometimes got repetitive. Character designs were very well-done with the minor exception of Akane’s eyebrows being a little distracting. The animation was inconsistent towards the end. I believe a different studio handled some of the episodes temporarily which led to inconsistent character design. Its not too distracting though unless you pay really close attention. \nSOUND (6/10):\n     Having watched the dub, I can say it was pretty good for the most part. Everyone fit their character rather well although a tad bit more enthusiasm or emotion could have made this dub better. I would go for the dub on this one.\n     The soundtrack was pretty good. Nothing worth downloading, but the techno music fit in with the futuristic-ish setting quite well. There were times when the music sounded a bit like something you’d hear in a club which can take some intensity out of the scene.\n     Both openings were fantastic. I slightly prefer the second op not only for being more catchy, but also for some clever foreshadowing and a more appealing style. The first ending is one of the few that can grab my interest and keep me till the very end. The animation is also flashy and impressive. The second ending is decent though it didn’t hold my interest for long. \nENJOYMENT (8/10):\n     The action scenes and the dominator gun were always fun to watch and the show always knew how to keep the suspense going. Unfortunately, the show got boring during the pretentious monologues on its philosophical themes that were ultimately never really delved on. The resolution wasn’t the most satisfying ending ever and the show was clearly setting itself for a sequel with the plot going full circle and many questions left unanswered. The show was at least still memorable for Akane’s journey and fascinating world. \nCONCLUSION:\n     Overall, Psycho Pass was an entertaining ride. I recommend this for anyone who saw Minority Report as Psycho Pass has a few tricks up its sleeve. This show is worth a watch from sci-fi fans and those looking for an action show with a little bit of brains. I give Psycho Pass a 7/10.\n        "},

The series has some cruel and violent scenes not suitable for weak hearted. This anime will make u think and question our society. \n The story revolves around inspectors of Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Divison,\n          \n        who are in hunt for latent criminals. These inspectors are equipped with large handguns called dominators. The criminals are judged on the basis of their thoughts in mind which is labelled by crime coefficient.

Their is always a subsitute for any talent. The main villain wants to destroy the sybil system. For achieving his goal he creates chaos in the city. He is a bright and interesting character. This anime is a bit slow to begin with in the first few episodes but it pick up pace very fast.                 \nThe art and background was great and detailed the background effect was a good balance with the dark atmosphere.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Psycho-Pass is brilliant. Be warned before going into this show however it is extremely dark and downright disturbing, so if excessive blood/gore, violence, rape or brutality are too much to handle this is not the show for you. Think X-Files / A Clockwork Orange....kinda.\nSTORY: 10/10\nPsycho-Pass is set in Tokyo roughly 100 years in the future. People are happy, technology flourishes, Japan is self sustaining and crime is virtually non existent thanks to the 'Public Safety Bureau' a police task force designated to find civilians who fail on there 'Psycho-Pass' a mental status checker for early warning signs of unrest, you don't have to commit a\n          \n        crime to be taken away. Think a nicer version of the Thought Police from 1984. The story primarily focuses on Akane, a new inspector for the 'PSB' and Kogami, an Enforcer for the 'PSB'. While the show starts as a case to case affair a series of connected events which travel back to an old case leads to the hunt of a killer which carries on through the rest of the show. The show can be (If not always be) very dark and gruesome. I found the ending very satisfying however I can understand others seeing it as a bit of a let down.  \nART: 10/10 \nI'm no expert in animation or art however both of these things within Psycho-Pass are stunning. Animation always feels fluid and quite real in a sense and the art to the whole show is beautiful. It certainly does has a \"Ghost In The Shell' look to the characters but backgrounds in particular shine. Props also certainly must be given to the seamless blending of 2d and 3d animation throughout the show and having it all still look right being mixed. \nSOUND: 8/10\nThe soundtrack throughout the show is excellent and fits the tone of everything perfectly. When criminals are being hunted expect a very Western sound reminiscent of something like Cowboy Bebop. When our main baddie is around there are many classical pieces which always fits his tone perfectly. While serious things are happening there is a good Cyberpunk tone which fits in nicely and is reminding of something like 'Deus Ex'. My only complaint with the sound are the OP's and ED's, particularly the second halves. The first set grew on me steadily however the second halves OP and ED just never seemed to fit in a way. \nCHARACTER: 9/10\nThis is a very close 10/10 but there are some characters which the show feels as though could be gone into a bit more. Most of the time however the characters all feel quite real, emotionally they progress for better or worse and you can feel that growth, or how they're changing throughout the show. It can be difficult to make Characters feel like they have life to them, and while some characters I wish had there background built up a bit more that still doesn't stop them from feeling real.\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\nPsycho-Pass is the kind of show that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. It certainly isn't a 'fun' show and as said previously is very disturbing. That may turn off some however I found that made me want to continue to find out all the answers. \nOVERALL: 10/10\nPsycho-Pass is not for everyone. Its disturbing nature is a huge turn off to many as the violence is quite realistic. If you are looking for a good Cyberpunk, Crime or Disturbing show this is certainly for you, and I could not recommend it enough. \n        "},

Its very thought provoking and presents some interesting perspectives on humanity and nature of good and evil. A little bit sci-fi but definitely believable.\nI think it stands on its own as a good anime, though depending on your state of mind it may rub\n          \n        you the wrong way.\nA handy spoiler alert for the faint of heart: trigger warnings for rape, nudity, violence and abuse of power.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Honestly, this anime was executed brilliantly, I enjoyed everything about it, even though it had a few flaws, they were quickly over compensated by the major strengths this anime posed\nFirstly, let's begin by reviewing the sound of this anime. Well to be blunt, it has an amazing soundtrack that fits well into the theme, the op and ep were all very memorable, and especially the EP makes you actually want to watch the Ending credits scene. However, I must say I was quite saddened when they decided to change the ep and ep in the end. Also the music just sets the tone, be it\n          \n        intense, despairing or hopeful, it's all there. \nLet's move on to the character development. (Second season is not so good with this one). The main character, Akane Tseunomori, starts off as a lost newbie recruit, now, we see her grow every episode as a detective, as well as understanding her more as a person, of course, this is all thanks to Shinyo kogami, who is an ex detective turned enforcer, who helps her be more filling as a detective. Also we see the back stories of the side characters.\nArt is great (can be better), this is most evident during the op, it just shows how capable they were of the art and style. It fits perfectly, however, in some scenes. You can tell that the artists made some few errors. Or just were lazy.\nMoving on to the story. This had a very good story which lead me to conflicting thoughts on who was the higher evil Amon the antagonists, you see this anime loves exploring the different types of philosophy and way of thinking, that's their main plot point. You see, there is a really unexpected twist that will make you question the integrity of the entire system\n"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Science fiction stories (particularly those set in a futuristic setting) tend to suffer from massive flaws that tend to hamper the viewer or reader's enjoyment, and these flaws tend to be too crucial for the average person to ignore. For one, it is difficult to create science fiction stories with realism that a person can imagine to be completely possible and realistic. \nYou might be wondering what that means. Well, put it this way; a science fiction story with realistic aspects that we can imagine certain elements to be possible is very easy to both write and think through. The average person loves to think\n          \n        about what the future would look like, be it a dystopian setting or a post-apocalyptic setting. This is what the genre thrives on, ultimately; good or even great ideas are easy to make and easy to sell to an audience, as it can make them think on a deeper level without them realizing the flaws of a work or even focus on the plot as a whole.\nThis isn't necessarily a bad thing either; if a story is intended to be thought-provoking, then it can not only work but also delve deeper into complex themes and help the viewer think not only on a superficial level about the future, but also what they can do now, in the present.\nPsycho-Pass takes place under that assumption; it is a show centered about ideas, about what people think/thought they can do to change the world and what they can ultimately accomplish in the face of overwhelming apathy and scrutiny.\nThe story starts off episodic by nature but becomes bigger in scale the longer the show progresses. The show's episodic episodes are interesting and show off many different aspects of how criminals think, delving into simple themes like the mentality of the workplace is in such a setting (not particularly pleasant knowing that worker's rights are still an issue more than a century and a half in the future, but oh well) and deeper themes like how the measuring system of a person's psychological state (their Psycho-Pass, Japanese pronunciation of psychopath) operates and how right or flawed it can be by measuring a person's psychological state prematurely.\nThe influence from Brave New World is fairly obvious throughout the show, ranging from the system checking what occupation a person is best for to people becoming dehumanized in the face of an increasingly seemingly perfect system that has a better sense of judgement than the people living under it. This is utilized to the fullest extent, and the setting is fleshed out and various different aspects as well as the culture of such a society are both well-explained and coherent for the most part, making the show succeed to some extent with its world-building.\nI say to an extent, and with good reason. The show isn't as successful when it focuses on how its technology works, which leads to a lot of confusion about details throughout the show, but especially in the second half. This is what I mean by the show working on a deeper level thematically, but not working on a realistic or personal level.\nThe artwork is generally solid and good to look at, with different facial expressions and complex characteristics that makes it easier to immerse myself in the show. A particularly distinct character design was that of Akane, the main lead, whose facial features I initially found jarring and a mismatch with how everyone else in the show looked in general. However, her facial features become more detailed and less annoying to look at, fitting better with the general tone of the show and becoming easier to get used to.\nThe animation quality during the show's original run was generally pleasant yet inconsistent to look at; this is fixed in the blurays (the version that most viewers have seen on their first time and what I take into consideration while rating this) and the show looks visually stunning, from a ridiculous amount of detail present in the facial expressions of the various characters to the jaw dropping background art which is beautifully drawn and does an excellent job in bringing the setting to life, and the action scenes are filled with adrenaline and intensity, giving us one of the best looking shows in recent years.\nThe characters aren't as simple to explain as one would expect. In such a setting, the characters and their various experiences under the system defines who they are and what they believe in, which leaves them being surprisingly simplistic. They are a far cry from shallow or underdeveloped, however, and while they certainly are defined by the various themes of the show, the show carefully balances out between the characters' struggles and grievances under the system and the more simple humane moments throughout the show, which makes it easier to accept the fact that the characters are fighting so desperately under the system yet also share different views of the same system that they grew up while it was still being formed.\nA particularly well crafted character is Shinya Kougami, whose struggles and mindset is explored best over the course of the show. His relationship with the heroine, Akane (who is also his boss. Kinda. It's complicated), is splendidly done and well-developed over the course of the show. The character dynamics mainly centers around these two and how they perceive the system, which works very well and makes for a very interesting contrast over the course of the show.\nThe main villains are varied and interesting, since they're also defined by the system and hold something against how apathetic society has become (although they have different ideas and reasons as to why). The relationship between one of the main villains and Kougami in particular stands out easily as one of the show's finest aspects, and it makes for yet another contrast that is well explored and developed over the course of the show.\nNot everything is perfect, however, since the side characters don't receive as much attention as one would hope (though are still well-developed enough to carry the show). The show also has a notorious habit of dropping quotes from random books, which is hit and miss depending on the arc the show is centering the quotes on. A lot of the quotes and references feel forced and unnatural, which kind of adds unintentional hilarity for anyone who has read the books in question (a particular example that stands out was a rather poorly placed 1984 reference).\nPsycho Pass is overall a very good show that suffers from certain flaws that plague the genre as a whole, while also relying too hard on external references to bring depth to the show with mixed success. The setting is captivating and interesting, the story is very good and the culture of such a system and the mentality of the people in it are very well-explored. It isn't a perfect show, but it succeeds where a lot of sci-fi fiction fails.\nI recommend it, as it is a show that's easy to appreciate and thought-provoking in its ideas, even if the technology requires suspension of disbelief and could have been made to be more believable with more time. It may have some questionable aspects, sure, but it works as a mainly thematic show where many fail.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Psycho-Pass (2012) & Psycho-Pass 2 (2014)\nIt is the sci-fi anime of 2012 and 2014. The genres Sci-fi, Action, Police and Psychological were molten in one pot and out came a drug for your soul. I became highly addicted after a friend recommended me to watch it. I am sure that you will too, after you've watched Psycho-Pass. It is now one of my favorite anime and because the first and second season are basically the same I'll write about both of them in this review. Let's start...\nPlot and Storyline:\nThis is one of the rare anime I can say that are brilliant. I love the plot,\n          \n        the story, the characters, animation, music....Everything! But let's concentrate for now only on the storyline and plot. It has that step-by-step story development, with no useless story-adds but with a couple of plot twists especially in the end. The end was such a surprise but hey, life is full of surprises. I don't know if it's because of the case investigations that made the anime so interesting (probably is because of that) but after you watch one episode you won't be able to stop. That's for sure. \nIn short, you have a gripping plot that makes your brain work more than usual but enjoys it at the same time. \nThe story is set in the near future when it's possible to measure the state of mind and personality of a person thanks to the \"Sibyl System\". The term \"Psycho-Pass\" refers to a standard used to measure an individuals being. Mostly measured is the crime-coefficient of a person to see if he/she is engaged in come crimes. \nIn such a world, against crime, fights the police along with some criminals who have a \"clouded psycho pass\", or for no reason high crime coefficient. They are called Enforcers. One of the Enforcers is in the middle of our story together with the inspector of his group. Shinya Kougami and Akane Tsunemori fight side by side against Shougo Makashima, a criminal whose Psycho-Pass shows a crime-coefficient of 0. \nIn both seasons, the main villain is trying to crush the Sibyl System. The only difference is that in the second season we have a new villain and some new enforcers and inspectors that replace the old ones. (It's hard to talk about both seasons without spoiling the first one)\nWhat one and the other season have is that little extra that makes each season so interesting and a masterpiece on its own. The first season has Makashima, a brilliant villain that makes the show interesting just by his presence and talk. I had to write down some of his quotes. Here are two for you. \n\"Humans are clever wolves not dumb sheep, we just convince our selves we don't know what's happening to avoid responsibility.\"\n\"Pleasures of the body have limits, but pleasures of the soul are infinite.\" \nThe second season has definitely a more interesting case. It was just so ingeniously done that I had to finish it in one day.    \nStill, both stories are awesome and not a waste of time.\nCharacters:\nThe characters of this anime are the ones that give the show the special taste. Besides the whole anime is about personality and deep thoughts of the soul of each character. Added are some father-son and partner relationships that are like the whipped cream on the ice-cream. They are all special, unique and worth talking about but I'll just sum up the main 5 of both seasons.\nAnimation:\nDo you remember the animation of Guilty Crown? The animation of this anime is anime is kinda on the same epic level. The colors, the character looks, the landscapes. Everything was just amazing. Maybe the amount of bloodshed was a bit too much, but you get used to it after a few episodes. Besides, there are anime worse than Psycho-Pass(Elfen Lied....just an example). \nThe only thing, and it's a whatnot, I didn't like is the character look of Akane. What's with those eyes and forehead? Come on... Also worth mentioning is the ending of the first season. Egoist-All Alone With You is an awesome song that I still play from time to time. All Alone With You-Egoist\nConclusion:\nThis is I think the longest review by now, but it's worth it. Such a great anime as Psycho-Pass definitely deserves attention. The story is amazing, the plot interesting, the animation epic...It is a masterpiece of an anime. In my rating a 9,75/10. (I am still waiting for the 10/10 to come out). \nI strongly recommend you to watch it if you haven't already.\n I loved it, you will too...\n Your AnimeGirl \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="                          \n    Psycho-Pass is one of these series that let you peek into future, to see how it will look like, it gives this realistic feeling of a existing world, with people and entities inside. That gives you a thought which is followed by questions. Can a world like this really exists? Is this a good way of living? I can see the cons, but there is also a lot of pros of this kind of life, right?\nPsycho-Pass might be that one series which will make you mad in a positive way.\nSCORES\nSTORYLINE: \nNow this is a real deal. The first episodes are nicely executed, you get to\n          \n        know what's going on, and how this world functions. Every person is judged by machines, since \"humanity has found the secret behind human's soul\". Every person is given a certain Psycho-Pass, based on the scan. The scan is translated into certain rank and number which tells people, if the person might be dangerous. Every person that is above a certain number is considered a potent criminal and is removed from the society.\nThe action starts in the middle, where basically everything happens, and then the show finishes in a weird way. I myself liked the very end, but not especially the way it was brought to.\nIt's a bit difficult to judge it, it is definitely good to watch, the world they live in is especially interesting, it makes you wanna know how it actually works.\nVIBE: \nThis anime tends to be very dark-ish. It's wants to be very gloomy and creepy at times. Which they manage to do, some cases that are solved there are really out of this world.\nBut overall they managed to do what they wanted to do. Make a dark-ish vibe that might give you goose bumps, when you think deeper about the matter.\nART STYLE:\nI like it very much. As I said before they manage to provide a dark-ish vibe around it. I especially like the character models of men, they are really up there, when you look at Kougami, you feel the manliness coming out of him, lovin it.\nWhat I didn't like though, were women faces, they look kinda derpish. It's about the eyes, I guess they tried to make it original, but it didnt work that well. Most women in this series look bad.\nBut when you look at the city, there's that feeling of futuristic Japan. It's big, it's shiny and full of people, it's pretty awesome to look at. Especially for people like me, who are mostly scared of enormous cities.\nMUSIC/VOICEACTING:\nLet's talk about music for starters.\nI love all endings and openings, they are so freaking good, every and each one of them fits the style of the series and fits my tastes of music, lovin the choices.\nAbout the soundtrack. You basically taste that futuristic music, with weird machine sounds, it's not bad, of course not! It fits the anime a lot, but I myself would not listen to it outside the anime, which is a shame. I cant really connect any feelings from anime to the soundtrack they provide.\nVoice acting is so good, it's an awesome quality. Their voices are the best for the characters they made. I didn't like main protagonists voice, I guess it's my personal preference, but the voice sounded like a 12-year-old child was speaking, and I couldn't really bear that (even though I know this is Kanade's voice from Angel Beats).\nConclusion: \nWell the conclusion is simple, it's a good anime, that none can copy, which is what I am mostly looking for. I myself was mostly interested in how this world with a new judgment system works, it is interesing to look at people in a world that in future could be ours. \nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/7deasT9aOYc"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    There are many different opinions on the 2012-2013 hit anime, Psycho Pass. Though, after looking at forums discussing this anime, and other online reviews, there is something very common among the fans that enjoyed the show to its fullest and those who were left a bit disappointed. Going into Psycho Pass, with high expectations, expecting it to be like your favorite sci-fi classics is a big mistake if you wish to enjoy the show. The show is only just good, it is nothing special and expecting it to be so, will leave you disappointed after you discover the truth. In any case here is my\n          \n        review on Psycho Pass.\nStory: 7.3/10\nThe Psycho Pass story is about a future Japan, where everyone lives in what they think is a perfect world. Everything in this world is calculated by a system, dubbed the Sibyl System. The system calculates and determines what is best for society and also punishes potential criminals, before they even commit acts of evil. Everything seems perfect. However there are always those that are itching to be free.\nDepending on who you are the Psycho Pass story will leave you with different impressions. If you are someone who is a major fan of Sci-fi and psychological fictional stories, than you have definitely seen many others like Psycho Pass. But if you are someone new to this genre, Psycho Pass is very appealing and a great gate way to this world.\nThe thing is that, these types of stories are still very appealing to many people. You could almost say that people just can’t get enough of them. And for that reason, I cannot give Psycho Pass too much trouble for having a… as you might say, cliche story line.\nHowever, lets talk about the pacing. The first half of Psycho Pass is very slow, to a point where I would say it’s boring. Though it definitely starts kicking, in the second half, only the very patient get that far. Psycho Pass uses the first half to show the viewer its setting and introduce them the characters. But because of that ‘boring’ first half, the second half was that much more enjoyable. Picking up the pace and only focusing on the main ideas, because all the nitty witty stuff had been taken care of. You just need patience to get through the first half, and then sit back and enjoy the awesome ride that is the second half of the show.\nCharacters: 8/10\nFirst lets talk about the character designs. There are many who will talk ill about Psycho Pass’ bland character design, however in my personal opinion I liked the designs. They were simple and almost realistic, they didn’t distract you from the bigger picture or leave you with any expectations about the characters (for the most part). I leave it up to you, on what you want to think about the character design.\nThere are two main protagonists in Psycho Pass; Kougami and Akane, there are quite a few supporting characters and one main antagonist; Makishima.\nAkane Tsunemori, is the female lead of this show, and the character from which the story is told. First thing I want to get out of the way is, how much hate she was getting while Psycho Pass was airing. Unlike the other characters, her design was to many people very unappealing, not just bland. I have no idea, why? Unfortunately, I cannot imagine why many people think that way, because I think on the polar opposite, I think the design was very appealing, and for once wasn’t just there for the sake of fanservice. \nAkane is a very innocent person, that is just too nice to be a police officer. But she is apparently so perfect that she was allowed to choose whichever job she wanted to, because Sibyl figured that she would be good at everything she does. But little did it know, that Akane would be the one of the biggest nuisances that Sibyl ever encounters.\nThrough out the show, Akane is very conflicted on whether she wants to trust Sibyl or not. She knows that the Sibyl system is very convenient to society, however she can’t excuse it for literally killing innocent people.\nEventually Akane turns from a very innocent police girl to a very depressed police girl. Character development? Yes, but also no. Because by the end of this season, Akane might have matured, but she never solved her inner conflict. Though, she was the main lead, her problems were put aside so that Kougami’s could be solved, and that was indeed a bit… meh. \nNow let’s talk about Kougami. Kougami is a your typical, save the day hero. Yes, I know, he has his own inner conflict and he’s really badass, but that’s just an upgrade to what Ichigo is. However, he was a very likable character and season two was very boring without him.\nIf we talk about development. Kougami went through it. But a lot of it was off screen, and he really just solved everything with some kicking butt. His opinions were in truth, just simple. But that’s the type of character he was. A typical hero, with typical views. \nThere are quite a few supporting characters in this series. And truly this is where the series takes a big hit. The supporting characters for this show are really neglected. Most of them are very interesting but we just don’t get enough of them. Some of them either get an episode of development or none at all. There is of course, Ginoza and his dad, which do get a bit more developed. And those were some of the best moments of the show, shame more characters didn’t get that type of treatment.\nThere is one main antagonist for season 1 of Psycho Pass and his name is Shougo Makishima. He is someone that the Sibyl System is unable to judge and he uses that opportunity to fight the system by committing crimes and not having to worry about getting caught. Just his existence is a fact that even the Sibyl System is flawed, but he isn’t just happy with that, he wants to show it off. Anime Snack DiscussionLike many anime villains, Makishima isn’t just all out ‘bad’. His intentions are definitely good, but he just goes about them in a very wrong way, taking the lives of innocent and what not. Makishima is presented to us, as being very philosophical, he occasionally quotes real and well known scholars. But a big problem is the fact that, that’s all he does. Quote them and move on. He doesn’t take his own advice is what I’m trying to say here. You expect him to, and that sort of feels a bit incomplete. Anime Snack Discussion\nEnjoyment: 7.6/10\nLike I said before, the first half of Psycho Pass was pretty boring because of its slow pace, and I definitely would have changed that if I was doing it over again.\nHowever, the production value for Psycho Pass was extremely high. Even though it wasn’t a classic harem or echii anime that gets lots of money, it still used up a lot of budget, and I worry if it made much back. The animation was very high quality, and there were rarely any lazy scenes or mistakes. The openings and ending are some of the best of all anime.\nThere is a significant amount of gore in Psycho Pass, and it is definitely not a show for the weakhearted, but for anyone who can handle it, that gore touch is a very interesting concept in the show. \nThe action scenes in Psycho Pass work really well with its setting and the animation. But if you were in for a psychological show that could be a downside. Psycho Pass does have lots of action/chase scenes, holding true to its Sci-Fi genre. \nThough the show was highly enjoyable, nothing from it stood out. The openings and endings are its best card against other classics and that’s why the show didn’t appeal to many people. It just isn’t fun watching the same story in a less impressive way.\nFinal Score: 7.6/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    The following review contains storyline spoilers, so if you do not want the plot of this anime revealed, please refrain from reading. \n\n'Utopia' and 'dystopia' are disturbingly interchangeable terms that require a lot of scrutinization to comprehend even slightly. When is a civilisation considered civilised? Who makes this judgment? When does modern invention become sociological necessity? How can technology affect us so that its existence is considered the ethical, sociocultural standard? When the phrase 'modern dystopia' is heard by the average citizen, they may picture a deserted, dark city with crumbling edifices and a handful of those that society wants not; hearing 'modern utopia', perhaps\n          \n        what they conceptualise is in fact the very world in which they live, exist, grow. \nIt is a hereditary misfortune that the verb 'function' is not included in that list of things that an ordinary person considers when describing their current society.\nPsycho-Pass, a twenty-two episode length anime produced by studio Production I.G, attempts to convey these concepts to its viewers through both a brilliant storyline and great characterisation. Filed under the Action, Sci-Fi and Police genres of this website, it easily satisfies all requirements for these categories and then some, but why it isn't at least somewhat considered to be a Psychological anime, I will never know. Psycho-Pass features main character Detective Akane Tsunemori, Enforcer Shinya Kougami and antagonist Shougo Makishima, and, as mentioned, tackles a heavily philosophical subject with both barrels.\nSet some time in the future, when a system called the Sibyl system fundamentally governs every citizens' lives, the MWPSB police department recruits young Akane, and her subordinates, the Enforcers, of which include male main character Shinya Kougami, comprise the main supporting cast in this anime. Their firearm weapons, the Dominators, are programmed using the Sibyl system, and are automatically set to a varying level of force when shot based on a person's Psycho-Pass. A Psycho-Pass is, in its most basic form, a record of a person's mental stability, and determines the possibility of criminal intent in a person. Later on in the series, the main antagonist Shougo Makishima is introduced as an individual who can control his Psycho-Pass at will, and as such bypasses all analysis of the Sibyl system; utilising this, he aims to create anarchy to bring life back to a blind, dead society. Now that the formalities are complete, for convenience sake, I will skip retelling the plot and start giving my opinion on it and the characters.\nI will state this clearly, ladies and gentlemen: I have never disliked an old fashioned conspiracy story, and Psycho-Pass's is no exception. A character such as Shougo Makishima rarely appears in a Action/Sci-Fi anime; in Psycho-Pass, he embodies what others would call a disturbed mind, and what he would call justice. This is an absolutely classic plot device for such a 'utopian dystopia' theme, and he fulfills the role adequately.\nI feel that if I were to analyse this anime further, I would like it even more because there is so much about the plot that is centered around the theoretical government of perception and sociology, which can be so intriguing. Later, the Sibyl system's 'true identity' is revealed to be a collection of neural networks that collectively exist to improve the Sibyl system's government of society through developing technology and understanding psychology. How interesting it was to watch as a technology aiming to be perfect was actually perpetrated by the personalities of those from the society they went on to govern. Shinya Kougami, wanting to rid the world of Makishima, later kills him with a normal handgun, drawing full circle the theme of will in an automatically structured society. I love theories and thinking theoretically, so I concede that perhaps I am biased towards Psycho-Pass's plot. However, I will say that, much like Steins;Gate, it didn't really quite become interesting until a little before halfway through. This is understandable, though: no anime gets anywhere positive without some context and a preliminary snapshot of what it has to offer.\nThe characters, like I've been trying to draw attention to, are really quite integral in Psycho-Pass as well. The aforementioned excellent characterization is shown not only through the antagonist, but also heavily in Akane Tsunemori. Her progress of evolving from a timid rookie to a hardened detective was both constant and brilliant to watch every week - the scene in the final episode of her as the senior employee of the MWPSB informing a later rookie was applaudably nostalgic and felt very well rounded. Shinya Kougami is not to be overlooked. Kougami's misifit persona, solitary personality makes for a very good link between Akane and Makishima, and basically every other character - the simple, circular metal of a diamond studded ring. Various deaths - executions, rather - amongst those of the supporting cast make for elementary examples of this anime's theme of societal government, which can be somewhat of a dictatorship to those who can't - or won't - see beyond the reality they were initially provided with. In short, Psycho-Pass does a very credible job of exaggerating its dark themes using primarily a fitting storyline and necessary characters roles.\nTo make an obligatory mention: the soundtrack was intense, and as such really very fitting of Psycho-Pass. Even the lyrics, produced by the excellent ryo, are suitable:\n\"God, where did you go?\nBut there's no answer; it's always like this,\nAre you still here?\"\nQuite a beautiful sequence of existential poetry that, like everything else does in this anime, ties in with the themes. And as for the artwork, it was great at best, average at worst. Literally quite dark in some scenes, but thus, again, befitting. The only negative thing I have to comment on about this anime is that I gathered traces of Neon Genesis Evangelion's psychological theme (specifically, you know, Episodes 25 and 26) that frankly did not suit this series in the slightest. I tend to worry about this occurring in the anime that I watched, but Psycho-Pass didn't exhibit it nearly enough to make me disappointed.\nIf you've watched anime such as Mirai Nikki and Death Note, then it's almost guaranteed that you will find Psycho-Pass at least appealing to you in some aspect. Give it some time to become the excellent story that it truly is, and enjoy the great characters. It's another great anime that I personally can say I'm glad I invested time in watching.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Pyscho-Pass is the best anime I have seen. \nIts greatest strength is that all characters are reasonable. Characters that are shown have their reasoning and personality fleshed out at least to the degree that their screentime and plot importance would warrant. All characters, even the ones which are not part of the previous set, exhibit behaviors and use argumentation that would fit their position and desires. There are zero exceptions to this rule. No one, due to a new piece of evidence or turn of events, suddenly changes character. If anything, Psycho-Pass uses these crises as opportunities to illustrate more on who exactly each person\n          \n        is.\nGenerally speaking, a cast of multiple strong characters does not appear, and when they do, they are not so numerous, and not in a plot-driven story. In Psycho-Pass, characters are defined by their goals. Neither character nor plot are simply decoration. Even if one views it as simply plot or character-driven, the anime still operates just fine. It was constructed both to satisfy casual consumption and to withstand intellectual scrutiny - though if you attempt the former it will push you towards the latter.\nIf we ignore a few scenes with poor animation, it is my opinion that Psycho-Pass has no weak points. The anime has at least a reasonably strong showing in every area.\nThere are only two things that do not make sense: The holo's source and function limitations, and the Dominator's power source and output. Neither of these pose a problem in the end because the story isn't about the technology, it's about the people who use the technology. This is admittedly a fairly common goal in science fiction, but most stories in my experience do end up getting lost in the baubles. Psycho-Pass gives constant reminders about how the world, with all its changes, doesn't really change. Perhaps the best example is the office's cooling system. These days we expect a central HVAC basically everywhere we go, but the office shown in Psycho-Pass is clearly only using three wall-mounted fans. They aren't built into the wall, they don't have fancy blades, and they don't even have a filter or grill for safety. This simpler, rougher aesthetic pervades the entire series, and when it doesn't appear visually, it reminds you that the environment is only a holo depiction.\nEven then it does not attempt to simply beat you over the head with it. In every conflict, the audience is always presented with a choice: which side do you believe, which do you support? It does not attempt to pass judgement with the results. Instead it accepts things as they are, and in every situation draws out actions from the set of most reasonable possibilities at that point in time. Most stories either shoehorn morals afterwards, or do it so poorly that it looks like an invocation of chance / deus ex machina. Neither of these are descriptions of the events in Psycho-Pass.\nI should also note my appreciation for the production's attention to detail. There are many things they did to alleviate inconsistencies and concerns that would regularly be considered as irrelevant. In one of the early opening CGs flying over the city, I thought it was weird that the tallest tower was at the edge of the city, and at the time I passed it off as lack of resources to complete the rest of the city \"behind it\" - this stemmmed from the common depiction of skylines in anime and elsewhere; the tallest building is always in \"the center\". In later ED sequences, Psycho-Pass assured me that the emptiness was not a mistake - it depicted a shoreline of the city, with that very tower right next to it. Another instance is when a character practices quickly reloading a revolver. The character had no training with it beforehand and was going to rely on it, and I like that the project team behind this spent the minute or two of screentime to show the character just drilling something that was important in their thought process.\nOf all the dystopian futures written across multiple mediums, I think Psycho-Pass is the closest to the path that we will take. This is largely because it depicts events similar to the ones we have already had in our world, and shows how it is also part of the story's \"Sibyl System\". In America the most common comparisons for dystopias are Orwell's \"1984\" and Huxley's \"Brave New World\", but neither of these draw too many comparisons to how the world existed at the time. \"This could happen\", the books proclaimed, and readers everywhere responded \"Well something else could happen too!\", and so most people just enjoyed them as stories. Psycho-Pass however takes events that have already happened / have been happening and incorporates them. This is the way most change occurs (i.e. not wholly revolutionary). The changes to society in Psycho-Pass, while based on a very specific kind of computer system that operates in a very specific way, do not really change people. There are still people happy with the way things are and in a believable way, not like Orwell where everyone uses words like \"doubleplusgood\". In bad situations people are also still relatable. The events in episode 14 have played out in real life multiple times in multiple places; the only difference is that there are no robots with happy mascot costumes, which really doesn't change anything. The events with the helmets are also believable: people ran when the situation was not favorable, and retailiated when it was. As mentioned earlier, Psycho-Pass does not get lost in its technology.\nTechnology is just a tool. Having and not having the tool may change the user, and the user may change their strategy and tactics based on what tool they have and what situation they're in. It does explicitly say multiple times that \"in the end it's just about the users\", but what it finally expresses is not that either, because it's not as if everything other than ideology and willpower are negligible either. They are important to be sure. But when it comes time to the real thing,\n\"Isn't using the net just like using knives for cooking or using paper to write things down? It has nothing to do with good or bad. It's like, it's there, so we accept and use it.\"\nIt's about doing what you can with what you have, and more importantly, that before you can do that, you have to know what you can do and are willing to do.\n__________________\nNumber Justifications:\nStory(10): There are some things that probably could've been done better. I'm told that basically everything was foreshadowed, but I couldn't see it at the time so I don't find them to be relevant arguments. That being said everything that it posited it executed well, so any complaints about how it got there are pretty irrelevant.\nMy favorite episode was the pilot. I think it did its job well in accurately reflecting the entire series.\nArt(9): Akane could've been cuter? All around it's definitely up to Production IG standards, no complaints.\nMy favorite piece of art... would have to be the Dominator. It too ends up taking its place in the story, theme, and message though, which only makes me appreciate it even more.\nSound(9): I didn't like the first OP/ED set, the second set was enjoyable - but these are hard to control the outcome of, at least as far as I can tell. The sound effects otherwise though show the same attention to detail as in the story and in the art. When Kogami is speaking to Akane in the elevator, his voice echos a little - these things are rare to see. One would think that an anime with people talking half the time and in suits almost all the time can't really do much to do in the sound department, but the people on sound behind Psycho-Pass definitely caught my attention and earned their pay.\nI will definitely remember the second ED.\nCharacter(10): Largely talked about this in the main review. I see amazing characters here and there all the time, but they're always surrounded by only one, maximum two, other full characters - and when it is three characters, it's usually a love triangle story and everything revolves around that. Infinite Ryvius succeeded at having a lot of characters you could remember, but didn't really make them full characters - it seemed that they were just representatives of ideas or archetypes. Psycho-Pass did basically everything I could hope to see. Every time a new situation came up, I wondered if this time the writers would get lazy? They never did. It always felt like it would be possible, maybe, someday, to meet the agents of the MWPSB. In this, the scenes of Akane in her home and meeting up with her friends were definitely not wasted in building both her character and the Psycho-Pass world.\nI like all of the characters by the simple fact that they're all developed. I think I like Masaoki, Akane, Kogami, and Mika the most though, in that order.\nEnjoyment(10): I did marathon it, but I didn't feel that I had to watch the next episode right then. For most of the series I could simply pause and attend to important matters - but not so much that I could simply forget about it. I can see how both of those have their strengths, and they lend themselves to particular kinds of anime - Steins;Gate needs the marathon feel, and Aria needs the any-time-you-please feel. For the pacing, style, and purpose of Psycho-Pass, this sort of middle ground, or third ground, was where it needed to be. This was where GITSSAC tried to be, I think. Production IG definitely learned from their experience.\nOverall(10): I believe Psycho-Pass has a clarity and depth of message and a skillfullness and care of its execution that is unparalleled in this medium.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    This is one of those anime that makes you ponder \"what is the right thing to do?\" Not for the faint-hearted. However, for those who enjoy deep, intriguing stories that deal with large-scale problems - problems of a society, not just a group of people - this anime can certianly ensure great enjoyment.\nSTORY: 9.5\n(+) Overall, the story is generally what you might call dark and depressing as it describes a society in which peace is maintained in a way that does not consider humans' will and emotions, and thus, some scenes can be very heart-wrenching. I mark this point a *major* plus because to be\n          \n        able to inflict such feelings in the audience, the story must be well-developed, and indeed it is.\nCharacteristic of Urobuchi Gen, if you are familiar with the name.\n(+/-) Pacing might seem slow at first when setting up the context and characters; but the more the anime progresses, the more smooth and addicting it becomes. One note to new viewers though, in later episodes especially from the middle of the series onwards, you might feel impelled to marathon through the rest, but I think it is better to keep a stable pace and let the story sink in.\n(-) There is a part where the main problem is unveiled in the midst of the chaos, but the story deliberately refuses to address it and instead goes back to the \"chaos\" without offering a clear explanation. Although it goes well with the main plot, it still gave me a little uneasy feeling.\nART: 8.5\n(+) Does not look weird anywhere, realistic, smooth animation and background, detailed designs in the important parts such as machines and some maps. In short, I find it totally acceptable and have no significant complaints, although it is not the most artistic.\n(-) Some people with high standards might say: \"This sunset doesn't look as good as KyoAni's!\"\nSOUND: 9\n(+) This series has the best BGM that I have ever found in anime! While watching, the BGM works so well with the scenes being played that I immediately made a note to get the CDs afterwards. It is background-ish enough to not disturb the flow of the story while boosting the emotion in the scene smoothly.\nThey sound like professional Hollywood movie music. Some tracks remind me of Hans Zimmer.\n(+/-) OP/ED sound insignificant in the first few episodes, but after a while when the story gets serious (and some songs changed) they can be great introduction/closure to the episode.\n(-) Not all tracks sound nice when listened separately (I'm talking about the OSTs not just vocal OP/ED,) but that's not a problem at all.\nCHARACTERS: 7\n(+) Well-developed, especially the main female lead (I can only say this much without spoiling, but you won't be disappointed.) Most others are all provided with sufficient backgrounds to establish their personalities.\n(-) I give this score because from the way they are described, no character seems special enough in general to be adored/idolized/celebrated (for both protagonists and antagonists.)\n------------------\nAll in all, this is a wonderful series that gave me a lot of new sensation and profound thoughts. For example, a despair that I had never experienced before when the foundation of your world crumbles. If you are not against watching such things, this anime is an absolute recommendation.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    ***HEAVY SPOILER REVIEW***\nThere's a scene towards the end of Psycho-Pass in which our protagonists, Akane Tsunemori and Shinya Kougami, have cornered the villain of this story, Shougo Makishima, and are going after him. The Sibyl System which controls their society judges Makishima to be mentally well-adjusted in spite of his heinous crimes, due to a rare case of psychological apathy. Kougami has planned to kill Makishima, but Akane objects to this as it is part of her duty to the Sibyl System to keep Makishima alive. Kougami asks her why it is that she continues to follow Sibyl in spite of its inability to protect\n          \n        the people. Akane replies simply “the law doesn’t protect people, people protect the law”. Indeed, the Sibyl System may be a morally divisive and blatantly corrupt system, but as long as it maintains order in people’s lives many see it as a good thing not to try and overthrow it. That is, except for people like Kougami and Makishima.\nPsycho-Pass, like a whole lot of dystopian fiction, is an allegory for the inevitable and seemingly never-ending cycle of corruption in all societies, except that it may be one of the most powerful and thoughtful executions of such a concept because it’s open-ended rather than outright rebellious. The setting is 100 years in the future, within a now isolated Japan that functions under the aforementioned Sibyl System – a form of crime control that psychologically analyses the citizens to decide what is ideal for them to live the life that is safest for them and their society. Of course, being dystopian fiction, there’s some issues within that society. It gives its citizens happiness and safety, but not freedom. This is handled by Gen Urobuchi, perhaps most well-known for Puella Magi Madoka Magica, a writer notorious for his deep obsession with moral ambiguity and strong focus on philosophy. Dystopian fiction is perhaps the most ideal form in which Urobuchi can express themes of morality, and as a result Psycho-Pass is his most potent work in that regard. \nThere’s a lot of going around in circles here in Psycho-Pass. The final scene is almost identical to the very first scene - a new Inspector joins the Public Safety Bureau and their sent to work on a difficult situation on their very first day due to a shortage of manpower. The final scene is almost frame-for-frame, word-for-word and gesture-for-gesture identical to the beginning scene. Akane probably realises this, but she continues on realising that as a member of the Public Safety Bureau she has to uphold their values even if they don’t coincide with her own. Akane is, to me, the character with the most ideal philosophy. Sibyl is undoubtedly in the broader scheme of things an ideal system, but it’s one totally lacking in understanding of the individuals that make up such a society. Akane accepts the corruption of her society, and though she disagrees with it she’s willing to fight for it for the sake of creating peace. That’s why the Sibyl System trusts her. \nAnother character, Nobuchika Ginoza, says to Akane early on that “the wise learn from history, fools learn from their mistakes”. In that case Ginoza himself is a fool. Due to his own humanity he ends up somewhat tragically following in the footsteps of his father, Tomomi Masaoka and being judged by Sibyl as being unstable, resulting in a demotion to Enforcer. He accepts this, and he accepts his relation to his father once he does by taking off the glasses he used to obscure his relation to him. Yet another character who goes around in circles, who ultimately has to come to terms with the unfortunate cycle of life. The relationship between father and son was the most moving subplot in the series for me, poignant to the extent that it brought a few tears to my eyes at its emotional climax in episode 21. Urobuchi knows so well how to tie his themes to an emotional attachment with the characters of his narrative, and it makes his works feel that much closer.\nOne of the biggest parts of what makes Psycho-Pass such a profound dystopian work is its attention to detail. Its character designs by Akira Amano were designed to be quite vividly real and relatable while also aesthetically pleasing, and at times such an aesthetic has a real visceral resonance that helps such a series. Director Katsuyuki Motohiro makes use of clean-cut but fine-tuned and effective directing techniques, such as making quick transitions through brief cuts to black. The narrative also has a strong attention to detail, and establishes in great detail the turmoil under the surface that’s been ongoing with the Sibyl System. Masaoka, being from the old society, is a victim to psychological effects of the new level of control in such a society. We see people come from many different perspectives with many different outlooks and reactions to it. We learn that art is under a great deal of control due to the system, and many musicians, painters, critics and other creators and observers of art have become disillusioned due to the scrutiny they face in a society that deems their philosophies useless, and we also learn of the ongoing attempts at rebellion that the Public Safety Bureau has to keep under control.\nAmong those rebellions, the most dangerous is perhaps the previously mentioned antagonist, Shougo Makishima. As also previously mentioned, Makishima is an anomaly. He doesn’t have the psychology of a normal person and doesn’t view certain actions in the same ways other would. Due to that he’s isolated from the Sibyl System. Makishima is almost childlike in a sadistic way. He incessantly and mockingly quotes the philosophies that came from the society that we live in. His loneliness leads to him playing around with people who have the free will to question the system, as a means of creating chaos and as a means of getting society to view things as he does. \nMakishima is unsuccessful, but he does manage to create some significant damage, the most significant within this narrative being his effect on Kougami. Kougami is a cold and reserved character with the single obsession of killing Makishima due to Makishima essentially ruining his life. Him and Makishima are said to be very alike, both morally autonomous individuals, but the difference between them is that Kougami has concern for others. Despite this the similarities between Kougami and Makishima eventually lead to Kougami betraying his concern for others, satisfying his own overwhelming obsession and isolating himself from society. Most certainly that’s a selfish, hateful act by Kougami, but not too far out from the ideals that have lead us to where society is today.\nI have one nagging gripe from Psycho-Pass despite my love and adoration for its wonderfully sophisticated messages and its thematic and emotional power, and that involves a few of the earlier episodes and their occasional tendency to tread on vapid crime thriller territory. One of those scenes is in episode 10, in which Kougami, caught in a game set up by Makishima along with a friend of Akane’s named Yuki Funahara, has to look for an antenna to communicate with his colleagues. He eventually finds it in Funahara’s bra, after asking her to take her clothes off and becoming suspicious once he realised she wasn’t wearing matching underwear. This was a very awkward scene that detracted from the focus of the narrative for a meaningless detective scenario, almost an outright immersion breaker. \nThankfully the Crime Thriller aspect ties in neatly in the long run with the series conceptually and scenes like that become small pickings relative to the broader value I find in Psycho-Pass. Many may find it to be heavy-handed philosophically, but I believe that’s what makes Psycho-Pass. Its philosophical emphasis drives it so far with such focus that only a truly strong work of art can do. Psycho-Pass is without a doubt one of the richest works that Gen Urobuchi has ever created, and a hallmark of quality in an artistically flailing industry.\n        "},

But the execution, oh the execution, it takes would could have been something great and makes it merely OK. Premises are cheap, they can make a cool pilot episode, but from episode 2 onward it's what a series does with its premise that matters.\nPsycho-Pass is licensed by Funimation.\n-Story-\nIt's a bad sign when I'm rooting for a character who is clearly supposed to be the villain. How did I end up doing that? In any other story of this nature, SIBYL would the clear villain\n          \n        (a mind-reading computer that runs the judicial system without checks or balances and often hands down punishments before a crime has yet to actually been committed? There's only a million ways that could go wrong). But deconstruction is a critical part of any genre, and telling a story from the perspective of the stereotypical villain and making his view sympathetic is an entirely valid premise. However, P-P fails to make SIBYL sympathetic. It's established in the opening minutes of the show that SIBYL is fallible, willing to issue execution orders for people who any human could tell was under temporary, abnormal stress. It's also clear that the threat of being flagged by SIBYL causes people to overreact, the opening episode centers on an actual crime caused a person who freaked out because SIBYL tagged them as ''likely to commit a crime\". Even worse, it can't tell 'thinking like a criminal' for the purposes of investigation from 'thinking like a criminal' for real- so police officers attempting to hunt down criminals are actually in constant danger of being flagged by the system and arrested. The 'Enforcers'- latent criminals who are kept as \"hunting dogs\" for the police- are the only people capable of doing real police work. The only people who can preserve the system are people who break its own rules- that seems like a pretty obvious logical flaw. And I haven't even mentioned the big late-series reveal of the inner workings of SIBYL. So we have a deeply flawed system, but are still expected to root for the characters supporting this dystopian social order? I know current society is a mess, but SIBYL hasn''t convinced me it can do better and gives me very good reasons to consider it a step backwards. The concept is enough to carry Episode 1, but from Episode 2 when the show actually has to develop its premise it flunked.\nThe flow and pacing are fine. The first third of the show is mostly small arcs designed to introduce characters and develop the world, with the last two thirds being taken up by confrontation with the main antagonist.\n-Art-\nBright neon colors against dark backgrounds is an aesthetic I absolutely adore, and Psycho-Pass brought it in spades. Movements are fluid and the CGI is well integrated. Character designs are good- the standout is Inspector Tsunemori. Her design didn't go for any obvious, fan-service-y archetype. She wasn't designed to look overly pretty or sexy, but actually comes across as a professional grown woman you would see working in a position of public trust in real life. That's a rarity in an industry where it seems every female character needs to blatantly fulfill one fetish or another. And there's something disconcertingly creepy about those smiling police drones used to secure an area. Visually this anime is excellent, hands down.\n-Sound-\nWhen I go so far as to buy a song from an anime and download it to my smartphone, the soundtrack has done something right. Both the OPs were stylish and fit the tone of Psycho-Pass very well. The first ED is so good that it I bought it, with the second ED being fine but forgettable. With all the heavy dialogue in this series I would recommend the English dub to make following along much easier. Funimation has a reputation for providing high-quality dubs and they didn't disappoint. Production values are very high in this series, if only they had something better to display....\n-Characters-\nWhen analyzing any story- anime or not- ask yourself \"What do the characters want?\" For example, in Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric is driven by the desire to return his younger brother to his proper body, blaming himself for the taboo ritual that stuck Alphonse's soul in a suit of armor. Rurouni Kenshin wants to make amends for the lives he took during the Bakumatsu. The protagonists of Psycho-Pass want... what? OK, they could just want to uphold law and order, but given that law and order are controlled by a deeply unsympathetic supercomputer that doesn't make for a compelling reason to hope they succeed. Enforcer Kogame wants to kill the man who killed his partner, but tell me what anyone else wants? Inspector Tsunemori is the main protagonist, but does she have any distinct personal goal? Meanwhile, the main villain is out to destroy SIBYL because he believes it is an unjust social system that degrades humanity to little more than cattle who go about their scripted lives in a state of blank-mined indifference. OK, a distinct personal goal, and a sympathetic one given how we've seen the faults of SIBYL. Frankly, if the story didn't make him an utterly sociopathic serial killer who enjoyed putting people in mortal danger just to see how they would react, he would be the obvious hero- and part of me STILL wanted him to win in spite of all that. I've seen other reviewers deride Gen Urobuchi for writing characters who are little more than cardboard cutouts designed only to express certain ideological positions, lacking any distinct personality of their own. While I haven't seen enough of his work to make an overall judgement, he undoubtedly falls into that trap here- the characters often drop cool quotes from classic political and philosophical writings, but have no personality behind those quotes to explain why they chose to use them or what would drive them to that conclusion.\n-Enjoyment-\nI enjoyed looking at and listening to this show, but it never gave me a real emotional hook. Once the 'cool' factor wore off I had few reasons to care and was largely finishing it just because I was already invested and  wanted to see how it ends.\n-Overall-\nOh, what could have been. A series practically tailor-made for my enjoyment, with a real chance to become something widely appreciated (sci-fi tends to translate well to Western audiences, and this show looks a lot like 'Blade Runner' or 'The Matrix'. I truly think this could have become a top-notch gateway anime). Unfortunately, great positives in production are undermined by great mistakes in story and characters. They cancel each other out and for all its potential, Psycho-Pass' end result is disappointingly average.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Overall:10\nPsycho-Pass is one of those rare series that I have come to not only enjoy, but respect. The first episode really draws you into this setting, and each subsequent episode only helps to build upon that world. Also it is so rare that I feel a series is truly complete. When I say this I am speaking strictly of the first season - which gave everything it should have, and knew the perfect place to stop. The second season is entirely unnecessary, and in my opinion, the ending of the first could not have been more perfect.\nStory:10\nOne thing I really love about this series is\n          \n        that nothing is explicitly spelled out for the viewer, you experience it along with the characters, through the visual cues and personal conversations. However, it is still very easy to follow and understand the motivations of some very different types of characters. I love that we are presented with an antagonist that really has some very valid points, and could be a hero from some perspective. \nArt:9\nThe style has a few quirks, but I think it really fits the tone of the setting. The animation is beautiful, and gruesome when it needs to be. The 'cinematography' is very nice as well.\nSound:10\nThe music in this was very well thought out, and fit every scene just right - it assists rather than leads the story. Also the voice-acting (Japanese) is fantastic. Makishima is truly cruel and manipulative, but intelligent and charismatic at the same time - the seiyuu's performance was chillingly-good at capturing all of that. I also must commend the voice of Tsunemori - the wrong choice could have made her annoying, especially at the beginning. This character grows and learns a lot over the series, and it is well reflected by the seiyuu.\nCharacter:9\nI do wish that there had been a bit more backstory to a few of the characters, but the depth achieved with the ones who were adequately explored was wonderful. Given the time and the pacing (which is commendable in its own right) I feel that the emphasis was placed appropriately. As I mentioned before, the motivations of the individuals, and the history of this unique environment are painted well in the character interactions and conversational intricacies. You can sympathize with every character in a different way, and still be satisfied with the conclusion.\nEnjoyment:10\nThis is a series I have re-watched twice already, and am sure I will again. There are little details to explore that you may miss the first time - nothing important, just things that sweeten the experience. The varying ideals and perspectives in this are fascinating to watch, and thought-provoking. You find yourself asking where you would stand in this world, and wondering how things might have gone differently. This is a series that will stick with you."},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="                          \n    SPOILER ALERT!\nSTORY 7/10!\nThe year is 2113, and society is far from what one might know it as today. Technology has developed to the level that makes possible the Sibyl System- an overarching machine that measures each individual's Psycho-Pass to determine the probability that they will commit a crime in the future. Viewers follow Akane Tsunemori, a new inspector for the police force that carries out Sibyl's will, and through her experiences witness the dystopia that is 2113. It is often lauded as a fantastic example of anime, but how accurate is that?\nAt first the show attempts to go with what appears to be a villain\n          \n        of the week. However, it turns out that all of these events are orchestrated by one man, which is discovered halfway through. From this point on, the plot is extremely linear, focusing intently on the fight to defeat Makishima and the twists that occur. This switch is somewhat odd considering that it happens midway through instead of towards the end. There is also an episode in the middle that goes back in time, something that would sound like an interesting idea. Unfortunately, it is used as a characterization for one of the enforcers, Yayoi Kunizuka, that turns out to be completely unnecessary since it is never mentioned again and just ignored entirely. It never even shows Kunizuka playing the guitar she was so obsessed with!\nART 9/10\nThe animation for the show is top-notch. While it would not be called \"the most amazing animation since so-and-so show!\" it is executed well. From combat scenes to fields of wheat read to harvest, Psycho-Pass's animation shows an attention to detail that is much appreciated by those who watch it. The studio responsible, Production I.G., is also an excellent choice considering its background in futuristic anime such as Ghost in the Shell.\nSOUND/MUSIC 8/10\nThe soundtrack for Psycho-Pass is well done. It matches the futuristic setting, and manages to not only help set the mood but also aid in the build-up of tense moments. A mixture of a variety of types of sounds, from electronic jazz to acoustic tunes, are within the album. It does not have too many tracks that would blow listeners out of the water, but the goal for the soundtrack was to provide background noise for the show, and to this effect it manages quite well and deserves respect.\nCHARACTER 8/10\nAs many might be aware, the head writer for Psycho-Pass was Gen Urobuchi, also known as \"The Urobucher\". While he is often said to excel at exploring morality and deeper themes, he frequently is found lacking in skill at character development. This holds partially true in Psycho-Pass. A couple characters get excellent development, but unfortunately it comes at the expense of others. The protagonist Inspector Tsunemori herself is very well developed throughout the show, and is entertaining to watch as she progresses in her knowledge of her job and her beliefs on how society should function. Her senior officer, Inspector Ginoza, is also handled well. He struggles with his Psycho-Pass and a legacy of relatives and friends who have faced a similar issue. Most of the enforcers have very little development, and it causes some of their fates to be less interesting because viewers simply don't care.\nOne of the main characters is Kogami, and he is the focus in the fight against the main antagonist, Shogo Makishima. Makishima himself is an archetypal villain who just wants to see the world burn, and Kogami... is a detective bent on revenge. There's really nothing else to him, and this is a major weakness in Psycho-Pass, since he is such an integral character.\nENJOYMENT 7/10!\nI very much enjoyed my viewing of Psycho-Pass. It managed to keep me on the edge of my seat while I also pondered the implications of the societal rules put in place within 2113. While I noticed a few glaring flaws, they did not inhibit my interest in the show.\nAs a show that often focuses on the catching of ruthless serial killers, Psycho-Pass is able to excellently capture the essence of suspense, much to the pleasure of those watching. Oftentimes, you will be unsure and very concerned over what an event might result in. Even the relatively frequent villain-of-the-week episodes will have a large amount of risk and interesting action involved. The action scenes themselves are also well executed, and provide an excellent example of such intensity.In a world governed by machines with the absolute power to decide each individual's fate, obviously ethics would be something that might come to mind. Should those with a disposition to commit crime be arrested without actually doing anything? In fact, this can result, on the occasion, to be the cause of some criminal activity, since fear of having a 'cloudy' Psycho-Pass... can result in a cloudy Psycho-Pass!\n"},

But perhaps more enjoyable than the story itself are the well fleshed out characters.

Those kind of dramas with the man-on-man action.\"\n\"To veer from moe,\" explained director Shiotani Naoyoshi, \"we took the heroine and the hero, and to start we DIDN'T have Akane take her clothes off, and had Shinya take all of his clothes off.\"\nHaving cannily revealed moe as little more than crude attempts at titillation—unbelievably, the very first individuals to have EVER MADE this\n          \n        cutting insight in the nearly ten years since the moe bloom began—the directors and writers of Psycho Pass proceeded to wow us all with the story of Tsunemori Akane, a sleepy-eyed waif who doesn't know how computers work, runs like a K-On! character, and spends at least ten minutes per episode being condescended to by her pretty boy colleagues. She doesn't allow their dismissals to affect her high opinions of them; during an early episode involving hackers and internet celebrities (including the inauspiciously named \"Spooky Boogie,\" the allegedly anarchist cat), she has her romantic fortune read and argues with her computer about the prospect of going on a date with her colleague and smexy model of masculinity, Kogami Shinya. Truly this anime has transcended the moe virus. The scales have fallen from my eyes. This is so much better than those shows where the female characters have meaningful friendships with each other and aren't routinely criticized for being insecure and incompetent.\nThis anime is barely worth talking about. The cast is a set of tortured caricatures who at best wish they were as interesting as Ghost In the Shell's Batou and Togusa. Most of the male characters look like they belong in high school, especially the orange-haired Kuroko no Basuke reject. There's two nearly identical tsundere guys, one of whom is Ginoza, the Inspector chiefly responsible for haranguing Akane.\n\"Fools learn from experience,\" he intones nasally in a way that no human has in the history of planet Earth, \"while the wise learn from history. Are you a fool or are you wise?\"\nAkane does begin to hit back against this pretentious man after tolerating his patronizing platitudes one too many times, only to have it explained that he has a *dark history* that led him to his present state of inanity. He's just trying to protect her Psycho Pass and preserve her purity, you see! Have no fear, though: by the end of the season, Akane achieves her goal of becoming a halfway competent police officer and can even use all that complicated technowizardry without any exposition from Ginoza and Kogami, despite never overcoming that crippling unknown condition that leaves her unable to fully open her eyes. Ginoza, meanwhile, ends up declared a potential criminal and demoted to Enforcer, though I'm confident this demotion will not affect his ability to condescend to Akane. It certainly never stopped Kogami.\nThe plot makes an attempt at raising Minority Report-style questions about crime and precognition, which would be more effective if the show didn't descend into stylized melodrama and anime cliches about Akane's pure heart. At the end of the day, it's an Urobuchi show; the story is told well even if its individual components are awful. The seasonal arc concerns the police's hunt for a man who aims to bring down the Sibyl System (the network that measures the potential criminality of Japanese citizens), and is thrilling if not especially novel.\nBut hey, if you ever wanted a poor man's Ghost In the Shell, here's Psycho Pass!

Also, don't expect any specific details as I tried my absolute best to not spoil even in the slightest of what's going to happen. \nPsycho pass has almost everything an anime needs: good characters, a strong story, powerful bgm/ost, and sensational artwork. I'm actually kind of surprised a lot of people still don't know about the series, especially with the second series airing right now. Although there are several cons to this anime, it does not compare to the pros that makes this brutal detective-themed, crime drama a masterpiece to many people today.\nBad introduction?\n          \n        Read on and find out.\nStarting with the story, (TL;DR) I gave it a 9/10 because of the pacing, script-writing, and the originality. \nIt's very original. A world in which crimes are being predicted based on a person's \"psycho-pass\", or psycho-meter basically, is one that's unheard of. Taking place in the future, we follow the joint detective work of both law-abiding criminals called Enforcers and the Inspectors take on both brutal and shocking cases throughout the story. What makes this story interesting is the main character, Akane Tsunemori, an innocent and intelligent student that just becomes an Inspector in the midst of all this madness. \nThe criminal cases are so well-done and the brutal things the criminals do are very original and unheard of. The script-writing and pacing is also very well done. It's one of those animes that hops into action very frequently and doesn't spend a whole episode just investigating. The explanations, the events, and the actions that follow from the characters all act accordingly and really flows the story well. Nothing doesn't happen for no reason and each episode builds up to something greater. \nOverall, in terms of story, Psycho-pass does a very good job in getting the viewers on the edge of their seats at times and, on other occasions, on the end of your seat contemplating \"how does all this make sense?\" and \"what's the criminal going to do next?\". \nCharacters - (TL;DR) I give this a 9/10 because of the main character, character development, and cohesiveness of all these characters. \nThis is one of the more stronger aspects of this anime. Each character has his or her own philosophy and usefulness in this detective story. We have:\n1. Shion - the database who provides back-up behind the computer.  \n2. Kougami - the badass who breaks down the clues \n3. Ginoza - the prideful and cautious detective \n4. Kagari - the sly second badass who does the dirty work\n5. Masaoki - the father figure of the bunch\n6. Kunizuka - the well-rounded enforcer\nand finally...\n7. Akane - the deducer\nThe characters develop heavily on the way, especially Akane because I mean.. who wouldn't change after witnessing all this crap?! Nothing is more fulfilling than seeing a character change from the sheltered asian student into the detective everyone needs. This doesn't apply to just Akane, but many other characters, especially the criminals. \nBackstory to backstory, almost every person becomes a lovable character who act on reason rather than pure psychopathic tendencies. No character is created for one sole purpose and that's something very appreciative of an anime. \nSound - 10/10 because it's just THAT GOOD! (Lyricism, catchy, voice actors are awesome)\nWhat do you get when you mix a rock band, techno, dubstep, electro, and an orchestra in the future?\nYou get psycho-pass music. \nPsycho-pass probably topped it off in BGM and OST out of most of the animes in its time (which is pretty impressive). Each BGM perfectly matches the scenario and the songs only improve as the story progresses. It's epic, sad, catchy, and captures the whole feel of futuristic cops & robbers very well. What I'm truly impressed with are the lyrics of all the OPs and EDs. They actually capture the concept of the anime well. They all relate to either a person's piece of mind, whether an act is right or wrong (justice), or \"the perfect society\" which really got me going when I finished this anime. \n==== skip this if you don't really care (it's okay if you do; you won't miss anything) =====\nOP 1 - Abnormalize (English Translation) \n\"My head is full of things\nthat I can never tell anyone about.\nIn this perfect world,\nI roam; a lost being.\"\nED 1 - Namae no Nai Kaibutsu\n\"Behind the black cell bars\nI was born\nGo wish for the price for your malice\nWell, I’ll give you that justice\nas much as you desire it\"\nOP 2 - Out of Control \n\"I would like to show \nCut open my skull \nLook into my head \nI don't \nknow why I'm so harsh \nI could be so brash \nI'm going to clash\"\nED 2 - \n\"You'll never walk alone \nI'll go with you \nNo matter your sin, \"\n===================================\nOther than that, don't even get me started with the voice acting. Kana Hanazawa did a really good Akane Tsunemori (not that im surprised) and perfectly captured her personality. I was really surprised when I heard Tomokazu Seki's voice as Kougami ... cause for god's sake you're trying to tell me Daru from Steins;gate is Kougami??? Superb work by the voice actors especially to the main antagonist. One of the best literate psychopaths I've ever heard. \nArt - I give this a 10/10 because of its mastery in depicting the wide settings of Psycho-pass and the portrayal of the future. \nThe art is magnficiently done. I will admit, Akane 90% of the time looks like she's about to fall asleep LOL. But other than that, every character is done so magnificently well that you can easily differentiate the two. AND FINALLY NO CHARACTERS WITH REALLY OVER-THE-TOP COLORED HAIR (like red, green, blue, the rainbow). From the drawings of the city, to the gore, everything is done with high-quality detail. Psycho-pass' use of dark colors truly captures the dark theme it tries to portray and the animation of the futuristic technology is very fluidly done. Animations are fluid and it's truly badass seeing the Dominator transform into the Lethal Executioner or the Nonlethal paralyzer. CGI is a little eh.. but it was really well done.\nEnjoyment - I give this a 10/10 for personal reasons - philosophical, intriguing, and addicting\nThough it may seem all the badassery in this anime seems gratuitous like the fan-service it looks, this is not what this anime is about (but it's still cool). It actually takes a much more philosophical approach. We're talking about an anime in which detectives kill people just because a person is stressed out or going mad. At first, it seemed really dumb and I personally thought that the story was set up wrong, but as you continue watching, you truly get to understand why the story is set this way. This dystopian society questions morals, asks viewers what they think a \"perfect society\" is, and puts characters in a situation where even they don't know what they're getting themselves into. \nI don't know about you guys, but I really like watching animes that gets me thinking. What is right ? What is wrong ? What is justice ? How do we create the perfect world ? Questions like these continue to boggle in my mind today and it's something that will have me coming back to this anime anyday. \nOverall - 9/10 \nThough I didn't mention any conceivable flaws, this anime is still far from perfect. Giving it a 10/10 would be gratuitous, especially since the second series is still airing, it's difficult to see how the whole story would be encapsulated. \nIf you guys enjoy dark themes, futuristic settings, dystopian societies, characters that change, some really philosophical occasions, and bodies blowing up when pointed a laser at another person, then this is definitely something I recommend. If you already watched this and didn't start on the second season? What the heck are you doing!? go watch it!!!\n        "},

It's a gruesome series about murders, but why is it good? It makes you question the values and sanity of humans. What is a life worth, a press of a button simply because you're told so? The lack of free will and though not through enslavement but through mindless compliance and obedience, it's an appalling idea that we would one day have something like that, and to be franc i do share Makshimas views on most of\n          \n        what he say, not so much on the whole being a psychopath part, but that humans are judged not by scores and tests but rather by actions and their ideals. It's a great anime and i would recommend it to anyone that has a stomach to handle some psychotic and crazy shit and tons of gore. 10/10 Clear turquoise.\n        "},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="                          \n    Before i start, let me say that i really liked Psycho-Pass. The graphics, the story, the characters, hell nearly everything. Its the most promising anime of the year 2012 and i must say it has very high potential to become one of the greatest anime of all time. If you noticed, i said 'liked' not 'like'.\nSo, what stops me from liking it?\nInconsistency.\nThat word is the best that i can come out with that describes this particular anime. This anime is full of inconsistencies and one of the most notable one although not very important in overall enjoyment, is the graphics. The graphics actually start degrading\n          \n        starting from episode 5. I noticed there are more static backgrounds, cheap shadows, talking heads and weirdly drawn characters until later in the subsequent episodes, it become so apparent, they make me cringe when i watched it.\nThen, the story. The story starts off very good, explaining the setting of the world that this anime is based on and the main character interactions with her new working environment. The setting is very deep, dark and intriguing when it first presented. Full of mysteries and it keeps me on the edge of my seat to know more about this world. Then another inconsistency just spring out of nowhere. Japan, that is the name of the country the characters are living in. Although, in the first few episodes, the setting presented is not in Japan but some fictional nameless country( or world) and i prefer the latter much more better as it suit more to the setting. The story itself actually change it course from its original intention of being a futuristic detective anime to the usual cliche main character( the main character actually switched in the latter episodes) saving the world or country namely Japan from a villain that want to cause impending doom. Pffft.\nActually, the pacing is quite good, steady and no apparent rushing until episode 12 came along. I will tell you that episode 12 is totally uncalled for and disrupts the flow of the whole story that have been presented. As I expected, the whole show hit the dumps after this episode. Characters lack depth compared to the episodes before it and killing off character(s) after building up some mysteries around him, ending up I as the viewer, not knowing anything about truth behind the mysteries. And here i wonder why they(the people who responsible for making this anime) even bothered to create the mysteries surrounding that character in the first place. Its like they make a huge u-turn with the character and decided, yeah, lets kill off that character because he is disposable due to him being a non-plot related character. Besides, it gives viewers more sense of danger and urgency present around that said character. I called that bullshit and a cheap stunt to increase their show ratings. Characters become as 2D as they can get after this horrible episode.\nSo,in the end I feel that this is a high potential anime with great set of characters and vast setting but rampant inconsistencies that keep popping up as the show progresses, hold this anime from achieving one the greatest anime ever produced.\nConclusion: Its just another anime that screwed itself so hard until that i cant love this show. But i still recommend this anime to others just because of it huge potential.\nP.S. Oh yeah, what will happen when the clothing hologram or something or rather stops functioning? I wonder.\nP.S.S. Neglect the score as i am in the opinion that rating means nothing."},

The supporting characters are very appealing, their interactions with the main protagonists, their past and resolves bring more depth to the story.\nThis is a dark psychological-action anime that doesn't have much room for humour, and as one would expect from the author Urobuchi Gen, the characters question justice, good and evil, human's value, anarchy, and many other interesting concepts.\nThe animation is an eye candy, with outstanding opening and ending themes that convey perfectly the character and essence of Psycho-Pass. The original soundtrack enhances the Psycho-Pass watching experience. The main theme is intense, and very fitting to the action packed scenes.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    I got recommended Psycho-Pass many times, and every time I tried to watch it, I just couldn’t get past the first few episodes. But then, when I finally pushed through the first quarter, I was exposed to a really well written show with a unique setting and characters.\nSetting/Story – 7/10\n‘Psycho-Pass’ is set in a Sci-Fi dystopian world where society is judged and controlled by a system called ‘Sibyl’. All citizens of this futuristic Japan are judged by their ‘crime coefficient’, a number which indicates how likely a person is to commit a crime. This leads to people getting labeled ‘latent criminals’, which leads to them\n          \n        being arrested and imprisoned before even committing a crime. But people aren’t just born with a static crime coefficient, they can also become latent criminals after something that negatively affects their mental health happens in their life, such as witnessing a crime, getting bullied, etc. However, getting labeled as a ‘latent criminal’ doesn’t always mean getting imprisoned for life. Some latent criminals can become ‘enforcers’, which are people with a high crime coefficient who help the police solve cases. ‘Psycho-Pass’ follows a team of 2 detectives and a group of such enforcers, as they fight crime and try to catch a dangerous criminal.\nThe reason that I give the setting/story a 7/10 is mostly because of the first 5-6 episodes, which really failed to get me interested in the show and characters. It starts with a really cool setting, but ends up following some mostly insignificant cases, which will probably bore most viewers. This changes after the first quarter of the show, when the story really picks up and becomes great.\nCharacters – 9/10\nThe characters are, in my opinion, the best part of this series. I found the majority of characters to be really interesting, and quickly became attached to most of the cast. I actually cared about the side characters’ backstories and subplots, which is somewhat rare for me. The best character in the show is probably the villain, Shougo Makishima. He is my favourite type of antagonists, incredibly well-written, and someone who actually has reasons behind their actions. Some of the enforcers, Kougami and Masaoka, come at a close second. The episodes focusing on their backstories and personal lives were some of my favourite of the series. My least favourite character probably has to be the MC, Akane Tsunemori. It’s not that she is terribly written, but she just seems to pale in comparison to the rest of the cast.\nArt/Character design - 8/10\nWhile the character design in this series isn’t really anything too incredible compared to other anime of this era, it fits perfectly with the gritty, dystopian setting. The character design is, for the most, very good, with the slight exception of Akane, who’s eyes make her look like she’s always high.\nSound -  6/10\nThe sound in this series isn’t anything special – the OPs and EDs are decent, but forgettable, and the OST seems average at best. All in all, not too great and not too terrible.\nPersonal enjoyment/Overall – 8/10\nOverall, I enjoyed ‘Psycho-Pass’ very much. It isn’t perfect, but it’s definitely one of the best shows to come out in 2012. After the slow start, the story becomes gripping and really makes you want to watch the next episode. The ending is decent, leaving space for a second season (which I still haven’t seen).\nI would recommend ‘Psycho-Pass’ to anyone who loves sci-fi and doesn’t mind bearing through a bad first 5 episodes.

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    • My grasp on why people consider Psycho-Pass very good.\nPsycho-Pass presents a seemingly ideal society where the law and technology has been perfected to such an extent, that now people's capacity of commiting crime can be measured. It presents a society where the law has been perfected to such an extent that the needs of most individuals are able to be kept stable and any criminal or potential criminal can be known ahead of any proof or cause. And then it explores to which extent this could be a good idea, while also being able to present a story about the bigger picture, the establishment\n          \n        of the world they live in and how it works, and the smaller picture, the personal conflict between two people the system can't grasp.\nThe story's premise and the characters make use of each other well to create a compelling narrative. The desires of the characters that conflict with the demands of the social order are seen as chaotic and unwanted, while those who can maintain a clear head to the standards of the system are seen as an ideal person and are treat as such. This is used to create a conflict between chaos and order, rather than necesarily about good vs evil, keeping the story more grounded in reality, as people have come to understand, that things aren't always simple enough to just have a single label put on them. \nBut that doesn't mean that morality and personal values are simply thrown out of the picture either, but rather that characters have their own views on what is moral or of value, separate of the ideals of the system forced upon them, but definitely influenced by it. It shows how the system can be oppresive and alienating for some, while showing how it maintains their safety and well-being by keeping them accomodating to the people around them and by managing their stress.\nIt does a good job at representing what a truly lawful society would be, a society where the system serves its people so that the people can serve the system. What needs it satisfies. What needs it creates. What needs it abolishes. \n• What I think of Psycho-Pass.\nThe world is poorly written.\nThe society of Psycho-Pass is far from being perfect, even by their own standards. The process of finding criminals and potential criminals makes very little sense, in the sense that these people don't seem to be monitored well enough or logically. A good example is a guy that works in a factory where the Sybil System can't operate and identify the state of the workers, because it is outside of the range of its wifi, I guess. Lets exclude the fact that this is obviously poorly thought out but instead focus on the situation. Keep in mind they get periodical checkups on their mental state. There seems to be a tradition in that factory of at least one guy being schoolyard bullied there, being pushed on the floor, their food thrown on the floor, you know, that type of stuff. How does the guy keep his job and his mental state not rise to an extent where he is just thrown out of the facility? How are the workers doing that, simply not considered inadequate for the job. The system also allocates accurately where you are best suited to work. Does it not evaluate safety? Sure, it makes you ask the question of whether or not this system is a good thing, but, based on the proof you get later in the series, the system is indeed logical. And there is nothing logical about having your workforce in conflict and fucking up a guy for fun, as that can result into conflict. It's pointless to be capable of predicting and stopping any potential criminal if you are incapable of acting on it. It would be acceptable here if you sent trustworthy people, who you know would hold out well and would cause no trouble with each other. Too bad that doesn't happen.\nWhile Psycho-Pass does a have solid understanding of how the society they're in can influence the characters, it doesn't really have strong intuition on how it would change the criterias through which companies would work, criterias by which people would get hired, and even how the law would be upheld, as another example.\nFor instance, lets say that there are drones that are capable of analyzing the body of people to determine the cause of death, their state, and other such things, notably, things that are inside their bodies. So, how would these drones be programmed logically. Analyze the body AS SOON AS THEY GOT INTO THE CRIME SCENE FOR CLUES or do nothing until asked. I will give you some time to conjure up the CORRECT ANSWER. Yeah, there's this moment that I suppose is meant to be meaningful where a character thinks of checking the body for clues. Where I was dumbfounded that the series even fucking tried to claim that was smart. Because analyzing the body is one of the most important parts in determining clues about a crime. Who would praise standard procedure as smart. It's a fucking demand.\nSo the system is clearly flawed in ways I doubt were intended. This sounds really bad, but in an ironic twist of events, for once, in the case of Psycho-Pass it works in its favor. All these unintended flaws can be plausible and explained once you understand how the system works, which is explained. If you want to like this series, you can conjure up enough explanations to fill up any holes you see in the way the society was held up. Note that for some things you'd have to put in some really solid effort from your part, but it is possible to overlook a lot of unintended flaws, due to a single twist, if you can survive the series until you get there. In my case, it didn't make the flaws up to that point seem like anything other than bad writing, but it made me appreciate at least the current events unfolding. To sum up my impression of the world, it starts by making no sense from the standard of enforcement of law and employment, to being like I get it, but still, seriously?\nI'll have to make you aware of something that is a minor spoiler, in order for me to be as concise as possible as to why the explanation given afterwards about the system doesn't solve everything. I won't spoil neither the system overview explanation or any of the events, but rather talk about a single element that the series will make visible and might make you speculate some things and deduce some things correctly about a character. So skip this paragraph if you want to avoid that. This is your last chance. The system has people it can't process as criminals and simply constantly sees as good people, defined as criminally asymptomatic. What doesn't make sense about the system is that it has no failsafe against these kinds of people, which it has a goal of capturing, once their identity is known. Note, it makes sense that it can't find these people on their own, based on their mental state only. The fact that these people simply can't be made as an exception by the system or have some special force sent after them is quite puzzling, and quite illogical as well. There are some things that can excuse it a bit, but not fully defend it.\nThe world of Psycho-Pass may be flawed, but the portrayal of the characters and their desires, is okay. There's one aspect on which the characters in Psycho-Pass can be criticized, and that is that none of them are actually interesting people on their own. All of them are only seen in the context of their work and don't really exhibit any traits or interests outside of work outside of randomly quoting philosophers and literature. While I praise it that every time a character gets screentime, there is a point for them being there at all, I think the characters lack charisma, and don't seem to have a lot of individuality outside of the fact that they have goals, and I think it's because of the fact all the characters spend their time reacting to each other. I do agree that the characters drive the world forward and the points it wants to deliver across, which makes their actions interesting, not they themselves, as well as the motivations behind their actions. While I don't think the characters are particularly charismatic, I do think that none of them are irrational, and all of them are well defined, and to me, all of their motivations made sense and were enjoyable to observe. \nDue to that, the conflict of the characters was actually quite enjoyable to see. The divergence created by their mindsets produced an interesting chain of events, one character desiring maintaining the order, because that's the safest option possible, one character desiring fulfilling their personal goals, and one character desiring chaos. All of these characters interests, aligning amongst each other and creating an interesting conflict, representing both a point, and feeling personal. I'm afraid I am supposed to remain ambigue here, as to not give any spoilers, but I've quite enjoyed the final/overarching conflict. Everyone had a point and a purpose. It is a well defined chaos vs order conflict, with an element independent of that purpose. Self-interest.\nAnd while yes, the setting may be poorly built, due to the system on which the world operates is flawed and questionable, I can at least praise the anime that it makes use of its setting quite well, to create interesting conflicts and present interesting mindsets. Crime isn't just crime anymore. It is a method of expressing yourself after you've willingly censored yourself to fit in the world. Law isn't just law anymore. You don't respect the law to maintain everyone safe and avoid punishment. You respect the law and follow its ideals to be rewarded and keep yourself safe and sane. Despite the occasional questionable stuff, it is still genuinely interesting because it creates a world different from ours, which characters with goals different with ours, that are still relatable.\n• Who I would recommend Psycho-Pass to and who I would tell to avoid the series.\nPsycho-Pass is a good choice for you if you're looking for a series exploring the conflict between order and chaos, the philosophy behind criminalism in a world heavily limited by the societal system in place and the effects a system focusing strictly on creating a perfect system that works for everyone, so that everyone can work for it too. I think Psycho-Pass would be a bad choice if you have no interest in such things, as it has nothing to offer outside its premises and the influence it has on its characters. I also would say to avoid it if you have more interest in the world building itself than the conflicts it could present. Please also note, that part of why I consider Psycho-Pass just fine, and not worse, is because its flaws worked in its favor, due to the fact that the anime tries to show its establishment as both favorable and infavorable. While those flaws are indeed signs of bad writing, they didn't influence my experience of the show to much, so you should reconsider the actual quality of the show, past how I've experienced it. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    In near future, your life is decided for you. In order to maintain great social system, sacrifices must be made. Utopia has its price; or maybe perhaps its dystopia? \nPsycho Pass comes from the mind of popular anime screenwriter Gen Urobuchi (Madoka Magica) and Production IG. It is 2010s Ghost in the Shell. High concepts, heavy theme building, great production. But unlike GitS, Psycho Pass can’t (or doesn’t want) to work with its world in a proper way. From a plot standpoint Psycho Pass is somewhat solid. We have our bad guy with a scary plan and bunch of detectives who are trying to catch\n          \n        him. In between that we play this game of “is this ethically correct way of doing things” or “is this socio-political system worth the cost”. That is probably the biggest problem that I had with Psycho Pass. It becomes way too self-absorbed. Instead of trying to fully commit to tell a great story in an interesting setting, we are again and again being confronted with different moral questions and conflicts. The constant quoting of famous writers and philosophers further pushes this notion. I like smart quotations and cheeky nods as any other person, but it got annoying at times. If you want to include this sort of thing, you should do it in a more natural and smoother way. It’s great that Gen Urobuchi knows all these works, but it felt like intellectual masturbation at its most annoying times. \nYou may say “well they expect viewers to be smart and to enjoy all these talks  about writers and philosophers and everlasting debates about whether or not they live in near perfect social climate or repainted mega prison”  to which I say fair enough. This argument would work except for my other problem with the story. And that is present info dumping where it definitely shouldn’t be happening.\nThe group of bad guys are on their way to their big final destination. The apex of their plan. And what is happening? Info dumps to explain everything. It cheapens the overall experience. This keeps happening in almost every episode. Sometimes it’s excusable because we as the audience would be in complete darkness. Other times its plain silly and somewhat lazy.\nThere are some design problems I had. For example the Dominator guns make no sense in the story because they are direct contradiction of Sybil system with its rules and regulations. The techology is not original or clever by any means. Smartphones, holograms, robots. We've seen it 1000x times. There is really no attempt to be original. Hell, even the Dominator is similar to  Lawbringer from the Judge Dredd series. But these are smaller cons and they don’t affect the overall score that much for me.\nCharacter wise it’s hit or miss. Our main group of detectives are absolute cookie cutter team. The new girl who’s the audience character to whom we are supposed to relate and who is our eyes and mouth in this story, and the genius level badass detective who’s obsessed with this one hard case. There is steady development of our main girl Akane and I am really happy that at the end of the series we can see her as stronger person while still having most of her believes that she had at the start of the series. I am guessing that Kougami is supposed to be audience character as well on some level. He’s our inner consciousness. All of us want to act more like Akane on the ouside, and try to pursue the law, but on the inside we are more like Kougami and want to take law in our own hands. He’s little weaker character than Akane. There is lack of originality when it comes to the cast of good guys. So how are the villains?\nNot much better. For the first part of the series we have the sort of “monster of the week” situation. A killer appears and detectives go after him. The main antagonist Makishima is a mix of Johan from Monster and Hannibal Lecter (the show version). He is the anarchist villain. Doesn’t like the system, tries to show its flaws, and tries to understand humans better. But even he is not written well enough. His endgame doesn’t really make sense once you finish watching the series. Why hasn't he done certain things from the beginning? He's smart but also physically capable to a point where he can fight highly trained police officer and street thugs. It doesn't really fit his character. Would Johan just say screw it and tried to kick some ass too? No he would use other people instead. Makishima somehow ends up being more and less realistic than Johan at the same time. \nProduction is somewhat disappointing considering this is IG. The animation is boring. The CGI is pretty bad in the early episodes (that is even if I watched the Blu-ray extended edition). Music is mix of electro and orchestral songs. Except for one sinister orchestral song there’s nothing really notable. Voice acting is fine\nThis was a good attempt at trying to create big sci-fi series for this decade. If the script was rewritten one or two more times and if the structure of the show was done better it could’ve been potential classic. "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="                          \n    It is perhaps with a small amount of irony that I find myself watching Psycho-Pass (here after just Psycho,) given how it was essentially Production I.G’s previous work on Ghost in the Shell and subsequently GitS: Stand Alone Complex that really got me watching anime a short while ago. And while a small number of things may have changed since then, I pretty much just find myself back to square one watching Psycho, and to be quite frank, I couldn’t be happier. \nSet in the kindling years of the 22nd century, Psycho is a show that keeps up with a small specialist team of detectives\n          \n        and officers as they go about righting the wrongs of the futuristic society in which Psycho is based. As mentioned, one might immediately begin to draw parallels between it and Stand Alone Complex, but outside of setting and character professions, any major similarities end there. Where the latter focuses more on a world with prosthetics and the subsequent array of problems that might occur from such products, Psycho focuses on an idea that feel’s much more foreign to what we know. Less an array of problems, and more one of colours.\nIn this future we, or at least Japan, have developed the technology to be able to categorise one’s metal state and place it under a colour. From this technology it is possible to work out how an individual is best suited to live their life to their fullest potential but more importantly, it’s possible to work out how likely it is that one will divulge in criminal activities, embodied in a number called a “Criminal Coefficient”. This is all possible with the aid of the Sibyl System. Despite such a thing being created with the pure intentions of making society a happier and less dangerous place, it’s pretty clear by the end of the first episode that the way things are, are impossibly flawed.\nOur main female character of Akane Tsunemori is a new detective on the beat working at the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division, an organisation in which there are two tiers, the Inspectors and the Enforcers, with the former being people who have a clean criminal record and the later being those who have been designated by Sibyl as criminals, but have been given a second chance in which they can help society rather then hinder it.\nThis presence of a hierarchy immediately set’s up an interesting dynamic between the seven characters that form the team which the show keeps up with. Akane is a very strong character, she’s intelligent, strong minded and well spoken and as a result, doesn’t really like the way things are with the system opting more to trust her own co-workers based on her own judgements rather then that of Sibyl. A controversial ploy considering that Sibyl’s judgement is supposed to be final, any dispute of that system is to dispute the entire grounds on which Psycho’s society is based. But as the viewer you will notice these problems to, you end up sympathising with Akane since she’s a small voice of logic in a world where self judgement of a situation isn’t valued. \nAs a result of all this, Akane is a pretty likeable character; she’s feminine enough to seem believable yet not enough to consider her a sexualised character in the slightest. I.G struck a nice balance with her and they deserve credit for rendering such a convincing lead.\nThankfully, the same can be said for most of the other six characters that populate the team at the CID. They way they interact with one another really hint’s at quite a lot of history between them and really strengthens the feel that they have been working together for quite some time and have seen their fair share of shit in that time. Over the course of the show we are slowly but surely given reasons as to why certain characters interact with one another in certain ways and it really strengthens some of them as being much more then another set of 2D cardboard cut-out clichéd characters.\nWith that said, I do unfortunately have to use the word “some” when referring to those other six characters because while most of them are likeable, only around three of them actually receive the aforementioned development, with the rest being more their for convenience and structure rather then really adding anything to the show. For instance, one episode takes place in the middle of the series focusing on events taking place years before the series begins concerning the addition of the Enforcer Yayoi to the team. While it is an entertaining episode, it’s really only there for pacing purposes and doesn’t really add a huge amount to Yayoi’s character who up to and past that point, has very little screen time, let alone development. \nPlaying second fiddle to the characters is an entirely different aspect of Psycho that is superbly well done, its setting. Production I.G has this knack for creating worlds in the mind that both feel entirely fantasy yet firmly rooted in reality. There’s a strong attention to detail that remains consistently intriguing from start to finish, if you’re anything like me then you will just get a kick out of seeing how all these various elements pair together, seeing how people live in this future and how it differs from our own. It’s a really solid use of the medium and it’s supported by a strong sense of life and clutter amongst the various backgrounds that will caress your retina which is further made all the more awesome by this lovely mechanical tech that I.G like to do with all that fancy 2D/ 3D malarkey. \nA great example of this can be found in the guns that the Enforcers use, the “Dominators” that you have probably seen in the promotional art for this show. Their design is more akin to that of an accessory or an item to serve as a fashion statement rather then that of a law enforcement weapon. It really is quite a striking design so it’s no surprise to see I.G use it in quite a lot throughout the show.\nBut what use would a weapon be if Psycho didn’t show it of? While the gun looks really cool and all, sequences that actually involve it being used along with some actual action are few and far between with most of them being over pretty quickly. That’s not to say their bad, their enjoyable alright, the fighting is well choreographed and the limitations of the Dominator as a weapon only capable of being used when the targets Criminal Coefficient is over a certain mark adds a layer of complexity that is referenced throughout. But these moments really aren’t the focus of the show so don’t go in expecting an action extravaganza, you won’t get it here.\nMusic also play’s a key part in these sequences to, with more upbeat tracks getting me pumped for what ever is about to play out with more serine tracks playing more at times of discussion then danger. The music doesn’t just consistently complement what ever is on screen but it enhances it. The same can be said for the voice acting to which is all way’s delivered convincingly and consistently and I never found my immersion being broken from the show as a result of poor line delivery.\nThe real kicker to Psycho however is in its story. Initially, Psycho might appear to be an episodic show which, given the setting and the premise, could easily work. But after a few episodes Psycho really step’s a few things up and begins to have a more continuous structure. These bunch of episodes were easily the highlight of Psycho for me, as the world and its various aspects are introduced, were let into a string of gruesome murders that are intertwined with previous events in the world that we are not initially made aware of, but slowly let into what happened and what bearing it has on the characters at play. \nThe pacing throughout these episodes is immaculate and I really had a “Just one more episode” feel while watching them that made me want to find out how things divulged deeper and how circumstances developed. There’s a pyramid scheme of lunatics at play here and seeing how they try their best to screw things over hold’s its own charm. The final two episodes of the opening half play out like an engrossing game of cat and mouse that had me glued to my screen the whole time and they, as well as the episodes in the run up to this part, were by far the most engrossing and well executed part of the whole show, and the most fun I’ve had watching something in quite some time.\nUnfortunately though, after the mid way point things take… a dip shall we say? After being given a selection of wacko’s up to this point were left with just one main antagonist, a white haired bloke who everyone call’s Makishima. And while it was pretty obvious that the show really wanted us to resent this guy for all the horrible things that he does. Generally he’s just an intelligent chav, and the re-occurring rivalry between him and our male lead Shinya Kougami feel’s overly exploited and generally not all that interesting when going into detail.\nThis isn’t helped either by the fact that the pacing of the show takes a dip as well. While the first half builds up to what I could immaturely describe as a premature climax, in which Makishima tries to fuck over society, the second stumbles trying to get back into the flow of things. In the second half of the show we see Makishima execute two more schemes to try to ruin everyone else’s fun but in both cases they just feel poorly thought out. The first one focuses a lot of pretty much just screwing over the Sibyl System and during these segments there is *a lot* of exposition about the Sibyl System and it’s various flaws and shortcomings. And while there are quite a few relatable themes at play such as questioning how free an individual is and pondering just hopeless shoving someone in a prison in the plan that their mental state will improve despite being surrounded by people in a similar state, generally I just found what they talked about when discussing it rather meh.\nTo use the aforementioned show of Stand Alone Complex as an example, the Sibyl System isn’t really something we can relate to in the slightest. SAC focused on the topic of prosthetics and while the current technology is still in its infancy, it’s not hard to bend your mind and see how things would play out in the world of SAC. As it currently stands we don’t really have anything to parallel Psycho’s Sibyl to in real life and to have such a foreign concept receive so much attention throughout the course of the show really doesn’t help much.\nThis is further accentuated in one particular scene in which a man beat’s a woman to death in the middle of a street. On one hand it’s an interesting thing to see how confusing a concept aggression is in this peaceful utopia, but on the other hand it’s the same peaceful utopia that spawned our very much aware of violence team of hero’s. It’s not a huge issue, but there’s no denying a feeling of disconnect between our main characters and the world that they inhabit beyond the fact that most of them are latent criminals.\nFinally in the last attempt that we see playing out from Makishima, there’s a distinct lack of logic in the proceedings. Without trying to give too much away, the final scheme could be described as the lowest risk, highest reward plan out of the bunch and it really makes the question of, “Why he didn’t just do it all sooner before he had the cops tailing him?” linger in your mind. \nIn the end, Psycho-Pass isn’t a perfect show, in fact there’s a pretty big “to do” list of improvements if a season two was to ever happen. But the opening half of the show is so superbly well done and so engrossing that’s I feel like I can let slide most of the dip in quality that the second half experiences. And even then I still found the second half pretty enjoyable simply down to the setting and aesthetics on display. In case I haven’t made it clear enough, if you liked Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex then you should probably give Psycho-Pass a punt, just be warned to expect similar flaws. But over all, it’s really not a bad show.\n        "},

I'm seeing people give around 7-8 in MAL just because it looks 'unique' in a special way in their own. \nI'll first talk about the criteria that is centered around MAL before I get to the juicy parts. \nThis anime was undoubtedly one of the better animes around the season it spawned upon, but lost its promise half way throughout the TV show.\nStory 5/10\nI don't want to be such a critical guy here, but this anime is really dull in terms of story and deliverance.\n          \n        It shoots out random quotes from Pascal, Nietze, and other philosphers and tries to explain them to the viewer as if creativity was not allowed. There are no hidden metaphors or any room for interpretation in this pretentious story. Most of the quotes they say are random and show no intelligence whatsoever because most of the characters in this anime are uncharismatic mental retards with the crappiest dialouge you will hear in an anime when you get to the raw meat and bones of it. Story revolves around those uncharismatic quote throwing retards. You begin to not care about the story at times because the characters are boring and there are couple asspulls you will begin to see. \nArt 8/10\nThe art is one of the highlights in this anime as they are fluid and well done with some decent character designs that has a striking resemblance to death note. It's has good art thanks to its production value.\nSound 8/10\nAs a fan of Supercell I am very biased here. But the songs in the anime itself goes well with the atmosphere in general, but none are memorable.\nCharacter 4/10\nThis anime is supposedly a 'story based' animation, but its characters lack depth and interest. Almost none of the characters actually go through character development and they are forgettable and dull at the same time. Its main villian is supposedly an intelligent person, but in reality he is the shitty shadow of the white haired guy in Death Note(the manga). The side characters are all just there for the sake of have side characters. The only ones with some history and small depth are the hero and the heroine. But the heroine barely changes throughout the anime and puts asspulls like never before. \nEnjoyment 7/10\nEven though the story and characters were retarded and boring in general I still liked this sorry excuse of a pretentious anime that wasn't created by shaft(get it?). I throughly enjoyed this anime to the brim because it's just dead beat entertainment. \nOverall 4/10\nJust because this is a 4/10 anime does not mean it's a shitty one. You can throughly enjoy animes like these and have the false idea that this anime is a 'deep' anime if you just watch it for the animation and sound. \nWatch it on a rainy day, but if not. Never watch this. \n        "},

In all, the near-future setting gives it a great feel of being imaginative and yet attainable.  You can definitely believe the society the characters exist in and relate to the things in their lives - except for the fact that most major facts of their life are determined by the all-powerful Sybil System.  They\n          \n        may dream and work hard and take tests, but combined with all of that is the value of their Psycho Pass which helps to decide whether they have any choices in life at all.  The story is gripping and intriguing as the world that we all thought to be so plain and clear becomes murky and obscured.  It provides some interesting things to think about with regards to security, justice, free will, and the actions we take in our own right.\nOne thing I particularly liked about the show is that I personally could relate very strongly to the main character and her professional setting - that of being the rookie in a hard and serious job whose position gives them final authority over their rougher and more experienced subordinates.  It was fun to see some of the parallels between issues she faced and interactions she had with that of my own.\n        "},

This show is a masterpiece all around and could be considered on any list of Best Anime. \nI'd like to discuss the simpler things before getting into what makes the anime truly something to be cherished and revered. \nThe art and animation are beautiful, no contest. The colors are dark and full of weight. It's all crisp and clean especially considering the huge sci-fi/futuristic aspects to it. The tech is seamless and fits in perfectly with all the other elements. Nothing feels out of place. It feels futuristic\n          \n        and so far from us, yet everything is familiar. The gory elements seem out of this world, but are a nice touch. It really adds to the overall tone present in the show. \nThe music and the soundtrack are yet other high points. The score fits in perfectly as well. It amplifies the moments and really gets you pumped to see the police get to work. The OP and ED are great too. I found myself going to listen to them after the anime ended. \nThe story is a work of art as well. It's dark, is full of complex themes and ideas. The dystopian futuristic setting where people are judged by their capacity to become criminals is genius. It's a system that seems just because it boils down how good of a person you are to a single number, but in that fact it seems indeed flawed which makes the show that much more intriguing. The complex system that is an enigma in and of itself that calls you to question what it means to be human and what it means to be good or evil. The anime does a really good job of presenting these questions along side the plot as it unfolds. You come to question the system in the show and even question the motivations and action of the characters. The plot also made the transition from the weekly case model to the single case that is the real problem seamlessly. Each episodes is a steady descent that takes us closer and closer to real story. Is the Sybil system, the omnipresent God-Like, judge, jury, and executioner , really something that should exist? You will find yourself questioning this as the show carries on. \nThe dialogue is smart and is much more advanced than most police shows. The words of the characters amp up all the situations as well. The conversations feel authentic and aren't contrived or fake in the slightest. \nThe easy highlight besides the story are the characters. There aren't enough words for how well crafted they all are. From the villain, to the enforcers, to the inspectors. They all mesh and work together so well to add to the feeling that things may not be all well with this \"infallible\" justice system. The trifecta of Kougami, Makashima, and Tsunemori are jewels that shine brighter than the rest. With Kougami and Makashima we see two sides of the same coin. Their motivations are similar, they are foils to each other really. You see that in their Psycho-Pass scores, the colors of their hair, their actions, their demeanors. It's the almighty class of light and dark. And then there is Tsunemori. She may seem like someone who is much too idealistic or naive or simply disillusioned with the ways of the world, but she is a necessary element to the dynamic between Kougami and Makishima as well as the dynamic between the fight for and against the Sybil system. Tsunemori grounds everything and constantly questions whether anything either of the two sides is doing is the right thing. She questions Makishima and Kougami equally. Kougami and Makishima believe almost too much in one thing while Tsunemori believes in nothing, well nothing isn't exactly correct, but her beliefs lie somewhere in between the two ends of the spectrum. \nMakishima is easily one of the best villains to come of an anime in a while. The cool, calm, collected nature of his is enviable. The white hair, his style, the way he carries himself. He's intelligent, not an insane maniac, and really captivating. In many ways this is a typical characterization of a villain we can sympathize with, but with the setting of the rest of the show, he comes off as one in a million and genius at that.   \nTsunemori is also one of the best MC's I've had a chance to watch. Especially as a woman, her depth is unfathomable and most of the cliches anime gives women don't apply to her. She comes off as a real person rather than an anime character at points and that really makes her shine. She kind of lies beyond the bounds of what it means to exist in this anime. She is again and again able to exceed, doubt, and fight for this world that she exists in. \nThis anime is the epitome of what it means for an anime to be \"Good\". It has all the right elements put together in the proper fashion for this to succeed. it's an anime everyone should watch, whether this is something you'd tune into or not. It's got everything anyone could hope for in an anime or any form of entertainment really. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Psycho Pass, all I knew about it when I started watching it was that it was a really awesome anime with action and detective stuff. I didn't read much into it and just started watching. I have to say, it's not called awesome for nothing. Right from the first episode, this anime had me glued to the screen right up till it was finished. Well, that was my biased opinion. Let me now write a review that'll tell you exactly what you're getting into.\nStory 9/10:\nJapan is now shut off from the world and completely self sufficient. This is because of the computerized system, Sibyl System,\n          \n        who takes all the decisions for you so that you lead a fruitful and happy life. Basically, you just have to do what the system says and you live happily. That's the setting.\nOur main cast are detectives who investigate murders, again with the help of the Sibyl System's Dominators (guns which paralyze or kill people depending on their crime coefficients or badness). But some people are immune to Sibyl's judgement and reek havoc in Japan. What justice should the detectives turn to in order to stop those immune criminals. That's the story.\nStarting off with small crimes, the anime turns into the story mode after 2-3 episodes with each episode filled with action, mystery and amazing detective work.\nYeah, it might be action but there is some epic detective work so if you like thinking type anime, this is good for you.\nArt 9/10:\nAmazing backgrounds and artwork. Nothing bad to say about it. Everything's good. Our main male character is pretty badass and our female lead is kawaii. As for the side characters, they are also really amazingly designed. What else do you want?\nSound 10/10:\nOne word: EGOIST. That's all it takes for anime fans to know what an awesome soundtrack this anime will have. The openings, though good, are nothing compared to the ending songs. \n1st ending song: Namae no Kaibutsu - EGOIST\n2nd ending song: All Alone With You - EGOIST\nCharacter 9/10:\nThe characters are either Inspectors (detectives with low Crime Coeff) or Enforcers (detectives with high crime coeff). Each has his/her own history and story to tell about how they became an Enforcer or Inspector. Though the anime doesn't dedicate episodes to every main character but some do get special attention. Mostly because it links with the progression of the story. And yes, characters do tend to die here. Our female lead shows amazing progression from the start to the end of the series. I can't say the same about other characters since they are all used to the job whereas Akane is a newbie.\nAs for our baddies, the main baddie isn't one you will hate. He's the \"different ideology\", \"change the world\", \"help people by destroying the system\" type bad guys. And we all know how well these characters work out. When it comes to skills, he's on par with the detectives. So, don't expect him to run away if backed into a corner.\nEnjoyment 10/10:\nAn anime I enjoyed from start to end. Each episode filled with thrilling suspense and action keeping me on the edge of my seat. In the last 5-6 episodes, stuff becomes intense and you just can't keep yourself restrained in your seat when secrets are revealed and the story heads towards it's end.\nPros:\n- Good story, setting, plot.\n- Amazing characters. Both good and evil ones.\n- Nice sci fi tech to show off.\n- EPIC soundtracks. Keep on listening to them even now.\nCons:\nI seriously can't think of anything. If I was to become really picky, I would say that the history of some characters who have importance isn't told in much detail. They just give a few minutes of verbal explanation of what happened to them in the past.\nOverall, it was a really awesome anime, a good choice to watch. And I think watching it again will have the same impact as it did the first time.\nThis anime is a must watch for those who like action and detective genre's mixed up with awesome animation and a sci fi setting.\nIt reminded me a lot of Death Note.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    NO SPOILERS!\nI put this anime off a year ago after watching the first episode, not knowing anything about this anime. The main reason I put it off was because the girl(MC) -Akane seemed uninteresting to me visually. I just finished watching it a week ago because I am on summer break and overall as an anime it was really good. The story had no confusions for me like \"Zankyou no Terror\" did, the story sequencing of \"Psycho Pass\" was great. The guns(destroyers) looked like the gun Tracer uses in \"Overwatch\" and the concept behind the killing with it was interesting and original. In addition, there\n          \n        were so many good quotes and lines from other works throughout the anime , it was educational and inspirational.\nThe only big complaint I had with this anime was the main character - Akane , the actions she chooses to do , especially towards the middle of the anime annoyed me. In some episodes she made me mad. After watching the first few episodes she looked liked one of those klutzy characters that develop well and get strong as the anime progresses but that was not the case for this anime. She was disappointing from start to end. The other characters were pretty good, my favorite was Kogami. After the last episode , I thought to myself imagine if Revy from \"Black Lagoon\" was the girl MC instead of Akane, that would have made this anime amazing. But then again , this anime probably would have ended much quicker if that was the case. \nOverall you should watch this anime, I give it 9/10.\n        "},

I put it on hold for the longest time, but finally picked it back up and ran through it. Watching in subs (Ep. 1-6) made it somewhat difficult to understand, which is what I think put me off. Switched to dub (Ep. 7-22) and things got a lot better.\nStory is really creative, and I enjoyed it a lot. It took a while to setup, though I suppose that's expected of something as \"complex\" as this. However, later on when things picked up speed, I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like some details\n          \n        were assumed or not as clearly explained as they could have been. It just felt like something was missing. (But it could just be me, especially after racing through this show like I did.)\nCharacters... were interesting. Their interactions were understandable, but I felt that -- again -- there was something missing. I would have liked to have seen more depth to the Inspector/Enforcer relationship. I felt like Akane underwent some sudden and dramatic increase in her ability to be a detective in the second half of the show, and that bothered me -- I didn't feel like it gradually built over time.\nArt was great -- very crisp, considering the Cyber-Punk feel the show is meant to emit. Loved the 1st OP and ED, but not so much the 2nd round. Most OST tracks are a hit, but a few miss the mark.\nOverall, I enjoyed the series, but would have liked more detail at points I felt were less clear.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    First, let me start off by saying that I want to pursue a career in criminalistics. That being said, I was extremely interested in the show upon first reading a summary online. It has not failed to disappoint me and earns a well deserved 10.\nThe story is set in our future. It features a world in which Sibyl, the \"governing\" authority, can monitor each person's state of mind on how \"clear\" it is. Not only this, it can tell whether or not a person is likely to commit a crime. Because of this system, Japan is the only remaining country in the world where it's\n          \n        inhabitants can lead peaceful lives. The people who we would consider the police are now a team of Inspectors and Enforcers, the latter part actually being criminals themselves. I won't go into detail anymore because I'm finding it hard to not write any spoilers. \nThe art is amazing. It gives a futuristic feel that enlightens me to the idea of their society through well thought out technological devices. The art of the characters themselves is exquisite, and relatable. \nAs far as sound it concerned, the opening and ending themes were amazing. I never skipped them, not even once. During the show, I will say the voice of the dominator was something I enjoyed the most. Every single time in \"judged\" someone I found myself unable to look away, even when the individual was legally eliminated. The character's voices were all spot on in my opinion, they'd sound exactly like that if you encountered them on the street. I also enjoyed the vast majority of classical works and related music that was implemented into the show at exactly the right moments.\nWith the characters I cannot say I disliked any one of them. They would all be considered the perfect \"team\", I think by a lot of people's standards.\nAkane is full-heartedly intent on obeying the law, and it's kind of refreshing later on in the series. \nKougami is such a dynamic character. He's definitely my favorite, for many different reasons.\nGinoza seems cold-hearted but with good reason, something that is revealed later.\nMasaoka is the guy that's already been through it all and is there to help you when you need it.\nYayoi is someone who really cares about her team with a \"level\" head, even if she is an Enforcer.\nKagiri is fun and carefree. Even though I was first annoyed with him, I found that he actually became one of my favorites, next to Kou, as the series progressed.\nShion is the analyst of the story, completely critical to their functioning on the field. Without her help, the team would have found it much harder, in some instances, to solve their case.\nNow I'll talk about a villain.\nI have another favorite character, and its Shogo Makishima. A lot of people hate the villain in any story but I actually welcomed him. His demeanor and speech left me feeling intoxicated with knowledge and insightful views every time he talked. I loved every work he quoted, and although I have not read all of them, I understood the connection without a problem. It's because of him that I actually renewed my love for literature. He gave this sense, that, every time he talked there was \"a feeling that you were missing out on something your whole life.\" \nI believe my overall enjoyment with the show is obvious, I cannot praise it enough. Although, I would like to end my review with a note; Don't watch this if you are a child or are incapable of handling mature themes/violence. I also disdain people watching this and other related anime who drop it when they can't handle the deeper thinking that goes along with it. It's all about getting in the character's head, especially the villains. Sure, you could watch this and ignore all the dialogue about the system and casework and literary references. But then, what would it become? Essentially, if you do this, you're stripping the anime down to the police shows you watch on TV today. Mindless programs where the bad guys get shot by the good guys. This anime reverses that stereotype. \n\"But I believe people only have real value when they act on their own free will.\""},

It's gritty, it's dirty, but at the same time it's scarily realistic. The world in Psycho Pass is weirdly relatable, and it's easy to picture our own universe turning into what it is in Psycho Pass in the next century or so. It is this realism that makes the story engaging, along with the very human characters, almost all of whom have a backstory that can be seen as \"something that can happen to anyone.\" \nThe villain in Psycho Pass is also weirdly likable, a bit like Yagami Light\n          \n        in Death Note. Not that you approve of his methods or some of his reasoning, but there are certain things that he does that are explainable. He is sort of the dark side of every law-abiding human being, the things that go unsaid whenever we follow the letter of the law. \nThe segregation between latent criminals and regular people in Psycho Pass is scarily plausible, and the way they are dealt with is brilliant and frightening at the same time. The technological aspect of the show will leave any tech nerd reeling: from the Dominators to the Sybil System itself, the universe is almost as well thought out as your average sci-fi dystopian blockbuster (see The Matrix, for example). \nThe music in the show is absolutely fantastic: the openings are very memorable and the theme music itself is reminiscent of computer games, which keeps the viewer in suspense all the time.\nI would recommend this anime to anyone, even people who are not very familiar with anime at all. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This review comes minutes after finishing the last episode. I highly recommend this anime to anyone, as long as they're ok with darker and more violent themes. The reason why is because this is one of the few anime that breaks away from the pack of anime and tries to be different not for the sake of being different but to challenge the viewer to ask questions about society and about themselves. Think of Minority Report and Law and Order: Special Victims Unit combined into one show.\nIt attempts to ask serious questions, and hence stays \"dark\" the whole time. This isn't like other anime that\n          \n        attempt to move from comedy to dark serious subjects and then back again. Rather it asks you a serious question, and never gives you a break, never lets up with a singular focus. Hopefully by the end of the anime, you'll at least know what those questions are.\nFor me those questions are how far am I willing to sacrifice privacy for protection. What makes something criminal? Would it be fair if I was judged by a psycho-scan to determine what job would I be happy with? That would tell me if I was prone to being a criminal before doing anything criminal? Would I be the detective or the criminal in this anime? This anime is so relevant in today's world of UAV's, cameras, cyber attacks, mass shootings, unrest, how we collect evidence and prosecute terrorists and even gun laws.\nPersonally, I've never had any movie or animation cause me to shake in rage but this anime did. I know many others in the forum felt the same way. Anger, rage, helplessness, a thirst for vengeance. The crimes in this show are dark, repulsive, like nails on a chalkboard that make you turn your head away. Yet they do so to demonstrate to the viewer unmistakably that a crime has been done. The question then, is how far are we willing to go to stop it. The anime is thought-provoking, philosophical, and relevant to today. That's a quality of anime that makes this a 10 in all respects.\nSome might rate the characters lower maybe because of Akane but I think having a really cute character might've taken away from the tone of this anime. I think her character design fits with the mood of this anime as well as the personality the writer was going for. In the last few episodes, I think her personality and character development shined the most with how she looks. \nThe music was amazing and I've grown quite fond of the opening and closing themes.\nOverall, this is an anime that can't be ignored. Watch it just because of what it tries to do and discover what you question. If you know the answer right away, then perhaps this anime isn't for you but for those that don't even know the question, this anime is invaluable.\n        "},

You know that feeling when you're watching a live-action film that's so well-filmed, with superb cinematography, that you can just\n          \n        tell? Like when you're watching Godfather or Fight Club or Inception. I got the same feeling with Psycho-Pass. The camera movement. Damn. How the screen blacks out quickly, intentionally. How the camera moves back and forth, pans in and out, to zoom in on characters' stricken faces or to fade in and out of a character's consciousness. Slow motion. The view of the glimmering city. The dried splash of blood on walls. The sudden burst of organs as caused by Dominator. The dismal rain. The interplay of shadows and light on human skin. The welling up of tears. If you saw Guilty Crown, also a product of Production I.G, you saw something beautiful, something scintillating. Psycho-Pass is more dark, more grim. For oh my, for this is the work of someone serious.\nRape in the first episode. Dismemberment, beautification of mutilation, treating humans like prey in a hunt, all to follow. All the work of human beings whose Psycho-Passes become clouded. What is a Psycho-Pass? It is a generated number that represents the potential criminal intent of a person. The higher, the more likely he or she is to commit crime. At a certain point he or she is dubbed a \"latent criminal\" and is taken to rehabilitation facilities, essentially prisons, where they cannot harm society. Is this system, known as the Sibyl System, perfect as society has called it? For a system to decide the careers of young men and women based on their personalities and abilities, to leave individual human decision out of the equation, is this right? Of all the anime I've seen so far, Psycho-Pass creeped me out the most. To think that some people out there can do such things, and think they are right in doing so, is horrifying.\nThe police force consists of two types of officers: Inspectors and Enforcers. Inspectors are the \"shepherds\" who are in charge of the Enforcers, \"hounds\" who were former Inspectors whose Psycho-Passes became too clouded or latent criminals given a new lease on life. These are the ones who look for latent criminals on the loose, face their lurid crimes, and judge them with the Sibyl System-created Dominator. For a latent criminal, this gun is set on paralyze mode, and for the more criminal, on decompose mode, which reduces them to smithereens. One of the questions new Inspector Akane Tsunemori faces is the nature of the relationship between Inspectors and Enforcers. Are they merely to treat them as dogs, humans with latent criminality on leashes, to be used to sniff out other latent criminals?\nWhat defines a crime? An act done by one whose Psycho-Pass exceeds the regulation limit? An act that is inherently morally wrong? \nLike in Death Note, the detective work here is brilliant. The interplay of moves between hunter and hunted. The dialogue, too, is superb. The constant questions of morality and justice and the strings over society's workings, these draw the characters through internal struggle after struggle. This anime also makes reference to literary works, to certain characters whose wicked deeds are mirrored in those of a certain individual or two. Several times the camera movement clearly points toward the title of a book a character is reading. Heart of Darkness, for example. Or the science fiction author Philip K. Dick.\nThere are two main types of anime soundtracks, I've noticed. The majority of anime OST is music to reflect the atmosphere, the characters, the hue of the story. A minority of anime OST has truly intelligent music. By \"intelligent\" I mean on a plane far above the majority. Where the music follows the suspense, the action, the inklings of a revelation, the sorrow and anger. Where the music is not merely to entertain, but to inform. Music that could be written for live-action film. Psycho-Pass has this kind of soundtrack. The opening and ending themes, too, are intelligent. The opening with the images of green blood cells to symbolize the potentially genetic nature of morality, or perhaps a set standard for morality, sung by the same artist as that for Tokyo Ghoul. The almost hoarse -- maybe the wrong adjective -- voice pulls at the listener, just as the story pulls at the heart. The ending, sung by EGOIST, is soft and poignant. Reminiscent of Guilty Crown again, with light images of the characters and fast-moving images of the city, just pulls at the ear.\nUsually I go into character as well, but as that is the most important part of any story, I'll leave that to you to discover. See Psycho-Pass, and be amazed.\n"},

For me personally, the many psychological and philosophical aspects make it incredibly enjoyable to watch.

Having said that, my personal litmus test for science fiction is three-fold: \n1. Does the story accurately and faithfully represent the science fiction premise? (in other words, did the writer have a comprehensive understanding of the sciences and/or philosophies he or she based their story on)\n2. Does the show fully explore how the characters and society respond to its science fiction premise?\n3. Do the characters convey (to the viewer) a general understanding of the conflict's philosophical elements? \nPsycho Pass surprisingly answers all three with a\n          \n        \"yes,\" which is very rare for an anime considering how generally weak anime's grasp is on western philosophy. \nThe story is excellent. It's rewatchable, and it leaves you with a lot to think about for days to come after each viewing. It's difficult for me to write about what makes the narrative so great without delving into its western influences: the works of Plato, Rousseau, Phillip K Dick, and Renee De Cartes dominate the conversations and arguably define the conflicts of Psycho Pass. While I've read the works of these thinkers and can't imagine what it would be like to try to understand how great this show is without a basic familiarity of their contributions to philosophy, I don't think it's necessarily required reading to enjoy the show. If anything, ignorance of those written works would help a viewer find the protagonist more relatable since she is also ignorant of their works. \nIf you ask \"should I watch the show?\", I believe you should watch the show if:\n1. You like thinking about what you watch\n2. You don't mind the occasional info-dump\n3. You don't mind starting a show whose first season is far superior to the second season\n        "},

It’s an interesting concept where society has become so advanced that crime and other aspects of life are judged with the Sibyl system. It’s a smart story, with multiple commentaries about human nature, law/order, and crime. The antagonist is not your standard one, and is rather highly intelligent and charismatic. The cliff hangers never leave you hanging like some bad one night stand. If it’s based on concept, then this would get a solid 10. However, there are some not so great things about Psycho-Pass. Though this is a crime fiction, you don’t get any cool analyses\n          \n        of crime scenes like typical police genres. Even the pace of the chasing scenes are pretty slow in comparison. The characters didn’t resonant as real people, and I was very aware they were the embodiment of the different perspectives for the writer’s social commentary. It’s still an interesting watch nonetheless, but definitely a dialogue-driven show.\n        "},

It kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time, which is a really good thing for an Anime show to do for me. In my opinion, it was a very original Anime show with a lot of suspense, danger, blood/gore, and I fell in love with every single character within this Anime.

At first, I was hesitant whether I’ll watch this anime or not. But when I began . . . . BAAANNGGG. This anime was truly awesome. Why? \n1.) It has a strong female lead character. She isn't your usual female character. Very tough mentally, but never afraid to show her true feelings. Loyal to her duty as an Inspector and I must say, she's the rational type of woman who never let her feelings dominate her.\n2.) No boring episode. It successfully keeps the hype up in every\n          \n        episode. As you near through the end, it makes you want it more and more. \n4.) It's very refreshing to see a Man and woman tandem with no romantic relationship. In a usual anime, man and woman or boy and girl tandems always end up being couples in the end. Akane and Ko, although cared for each other, their actions are solely based on their relationship as comrades.\n5.)Supporting characters are good. \n6.)There are always surprises in episodes. it never fails to amuse you with surprising events.\n7.)Literary References. Although i'm not that inclined in reading books (but I've read a few literary works), i always like it if an anime use them to include it in their dialogues.\n8) Male lead character was interesting. He's smart although usually, he's reckless. Good chemistry (not in a romantic way) with Akane.\n9.) I have nothing to say about the antagonist. I kinda understand his feelings toward the society but Im neither against nor agreeing how he kills. LOL\nAll in all i can say that this anime is one of a kind. A masterpiece in its own way.  I dont really care about how special the art was as long as it has a decent quality. As long as the plot is very good as well as how they tell the story, then i'm more than satisfied with it. \nThat's all i can share. its my first time writing a review so please bear with me. hope it helped you tho.

A show that really makes you think and feel. Psycho-Pass is truly an outstanding anime that gives something different to the table.\nNow when i say different, i do not necessarily mean something new. Action/sci-fi/ cop shows have been around long before Psycho-Pass. So you might be thinking then \"what's so special about this anime\".\nThe reason i enjoyed Psycho-Pass so much is because i felt that it was done just right. They provided just the right amount of the two main ingredients that make up this show, action and conflicting beliefs.\n          \n        The action excites the viewers stimulus, and the conflicting beliefs makes us pause and think just what is right and what is wrong. If these two do not appeal to you, then you mine as well stop reading and drop this anime.\nThink to yourself right now, \"what is my definition of good and evil?\". The main conflict of Psycho-Pass revolves around this question. Everyone has their own interpretations of good and evil, and we all act accordingly to fix what we designate as bad and protect what we deem to be good. Add in some nice fight scenes and a futuristic Dystopian society and the end result is Psycho-Pass.\nThe characters... it is a real shame, but i simply could not give this a ten. I gave this a nine simply because i loved the main character, Kougami Shinya, and his archenemy, Makishima Shougo. These two characters were like two sides of a coin. They are so similar in the sense that they are both radical supporters of their own views and ideals. The difference lies in their ideals and views, which causes them to conflict with each other in amazing battles of whits and strength.\nAs much as i loved Kougami and Makishima, there was just something about the other characters that did not click with me. The creators made a visible effort to make us connect with them, but i did not feel much of a connection unless they died or something. Even then i did not grieve as much as i would normally for an anime character because i simply did not feel like i knew enough about them. Perhaps it's because they do not get enough dialog in because i feel like i have such a vague understanding of them all by the end.\nThis is not to say that i disliked them though. They were still good characters that added on to my enjoyment of Psych-Pass. It's just that i feel that they could have been so much more. (For those of you who have watched Psycho-Pass, you might have noticed i have completely ignored Akane. The reason is because i think she is pretty much worthless to the story. They might have improved her a little by the end, but i still do not like her).\nEver since I have watched Guilty Crown, I've been a huge fan of Egoist. Imagine my surprise when i learned they were doing the first and 2nd closing songs for Psycho-Pass. They were both top notch, and the openings songs were not bad as well. The BGM's fit the atmosphere of every scene to a near perfect extent.\nI will admit that the whole \"omitting of moe\" from this anime had turned me off a bit at first. Seeing how most anime focuses on making cute and/or sexually appealing female characters, i did not think this would have been the best move for the creator of Psycho-Pass. It did not help when i saw the character design of the main heroine, Akane; however, it slowly dawned on me that the lack of random panty shots every other scene was actually a huge blessing. The awesome fight animations more than made up for the lack of any visually appealing female characters.\nAhh... what an awesome series this was. If they were not stuffing straight up action into my face, they were killing me with suspense. When they were doing neither of those things, they question and challenged my own beliefs. For those of you who are interested in any of the three genres that Psycho-Pass is labeled under in MAL, then i highly suggest you give this a shot. Just make sure to keep your Psycho-Pass under control while your watching.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Psycho-Pass is such an underrated anime in the sea of series. I highly picky on what anime's I watch, and when a friend recommended this one to me, I Gave it a try. Best choice I've made in anime. \nStory- Set in a Futuristic, Cyberpunk/dark setting, the story follows a group of inspectors and enforcers who are out to ultimately stop the antagonist, Makishima Shogo. The plot and ideas the writers came up with in this show were incredible. It's gritty, dark, gory and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Your constantly wondering what will happen next, what danger the characters are\n          \n        going to be put in, and over all it's highly psychological. This show really gets you thinking.\nCharacters- One word can some up the amazingness of these characters; development. There is soooo soooo much character development in this series. Akane is taken on a roller coaster ride of crazy and how she and the others react to it is perfect. They all have varying personalities that stand out, and there's never bland dialogue between characters. Kogami and Akane are my favorite, and they way they work together just fits naturally. You have the jokester, the flirt, the fatherly figure, the uptight figure, etc. It's easy to get attached to characters in this anime. Also, the villains in this show are so different from your usual 'I want to take over the world and be evil King fear me blah blah.' Shogo is a brilliant antagonist, and the atrocities and crimes he commits, are based on what he thinks is /right/ for the society and himself. The supporting antagonists in his merry band of insanity are disturbing in a way that makes you want to watch more. \nArt- It's dark, it's trippy, and it fits. There isn't a lot of bright colors obviously, unless you count the blood that is often splattered everywhere here and there. It's suppose to Be dark and gloomy. The way the characters are drawn and designed are beautifully done. They all stand out on their own. The settings are also done with amazing detail. \nMusic- HOLY FJDJSJWOWPPA. THE MUSIC IS FREAKING AMAZING. IM HOOKED ON IT. The openings >>>>> And the endings are done by a band called EGOIST. Flawless music, flawless band, I would highly recommend checking them out. All alone with you, Fallen, and Namae no nai Kaibutsu by EGOIST are the ending songs to psycho pass. Check. Them. Out. Especially if you're a fan of Japanese music.\nOverall Enjoyment: 10/10. It's quickly become one of my all time favorite animes, I'm hooked still and I finished both seasons. I'm waiting for the movie in January! I recommend this show to anyone that's a fan of futuristic and dark themes animes. It takes on a psychological coaster ride. You sit on the edge of your seat wondering  who will die next, if your favorite character will survive, and what twisted idea the writers of this show will throw at you next. \n        "},

Well, I'm here to disagree because this is it - the best anime of 2013. In fact, I loved Psycho-Pass so much that I bought it. Yes, it was that good.\nThe story is, how do I say this, brilliant. It's an original and realistic futuristic world. It's completely different from any cop show that I've ever seen. The thing with [American] cop shows is that they're all the same, so PP was a breath of fresh air. It's dark and makes you think about how easy it is to\n          \n        brainwash the human race. It asks the questions such as; What is justice, and can a system like this really pass it?\nThe characters all have to ask themselves these questions at some point. Some at a young age and some when they start/during their jobs. All characters are expanded upon with interesting pasts. They all have their own personalities and don't fall under certain archetypes, though it may feel like it in the beginning. The main character gets the most and best development, starting as a regular, brainwashed civilian and ending as someone tougher that understands what's wrong with their world. The villain is almost too pretentious but that didn't stop him from being one of the best villains I've seen in anime in a long time. However, not every character gets full development. Characters - 9.\nThe character designs weren't the best, seeing as the main character looked stoned beyond belief and Kagari looked like the most stereotypical guy ever (that didn't stop him from being my favorite character). Mostly all the other designs weren't anything new, but they weren't bad either. The rest of the art was detailed and dark like how it was supposed to be. Another 9 for this one.\nThe music was amazing. Both opening and endings were great (Op 2 and Ed 1 being my favorites). The tracks were memorable. The music gets 10,000,000. Uh, I mean, 10.\nOverall enjoyment is definitely a 10 because of the original story, memorable music and great character development. Each arc was entertaining and the suspense never stopped. I never got bored. And what's even better? The fact that there's going to be a second season. I'm so ready.\nFinal Verdict: Blu-Ray, man (that means buy it)\nBONUS: The English dub (which I watched after buying) was pretty good, although some of the voices didn't match the characters (*cough* *cough* Gino). All in all, the experience will be awesome no matter which way you decide to watch it.\n        "},

However, she becomes a stronger more well rounded character at the end of the series. The sociopath is clearly evil, however, I was unable to truly hate him, worse I felt little towards him.\nPsycho Path is one the best anime to come out of the winter 2012/2013 season.

Initially, I had given it a rating of 9, but that's mainly because I made a MAL account much later on after I watched the series, so I didn't remember much details about it. Now that I've seen it all over again with some friends, I got to appreciate it a little more than I did the first time around.\nIt's still a frikin' awesome anime.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    This chilling dystopian thriller from Urobuchi raises some interesting questions, and looks gorgeous while doing so. It is regarded as one of the standout anime from 2012, but does it deserve the praise as well as the generous amount of hype? This will be a mostly spoiler free review. I will not be discussing the main villain due to the high spoiler content.\nThe story of Psycho Pass is similar to many other dystopian works, with a future Japan being ruled over by an oppressive all-knowing system, the Syibl System. The system works by using a cymatic scan of the brain to determine a person's Crime\n          \n        Coefficient and their \"hue\" to pass judgement on their standing with society. The story begins by introducing rookie inspector Akane Tsunemori, as she is thrown out into the field in order to catch a latent criminal, someone with a high Crime Coefficient. This brings up a theme of inner beauty being valued much more highly than outer beauty, with charters commentating on how one can keep their psycho pass so clear rather than their hair or makeup. The first episode delves into how the broken the current society is, as the shows the flaws of measuring a person based on their Psycho Pass alone, and not using context as well as common sense to dictate what is the morally correct option. It implies that most are simply content with following what they are told, and do not question the authority no matter how morally ambiguous their judgement may be. The story then delves into a series of cases that lead up to the climatic end of the first half, and it becomes apparent that each of the cases are in fact connected by one single factor, one that has evaded main protagonist Kogami for some time. Kogami's decision to pursue this so called ghost lost him his standing in society, and another point  is that the first few cases offer up some interesting commentary on issues that people may have to decide on in the near future, as well as a case that ties in with the large presence of the online world.  The story really hits its stride after the end of the first half, as the main antagonist puts his plan in motion, and attempts to take down the system that he believes oppresses and ruins the lives of the people of Japan. His plan offers us some an interesting experiment on anonymity, and shows what people will do when they think no one is watching. The result of this is the big reveal of what is really behind the Sibyl system, and this reveal comes quite early, I would have liked to see the reveal pushed back to one of the last episodes rather than see what's really going on so early, as it detracts from the ending a bit. After the big reveal the protagonist are stuck in a wild goose chase as they try to find the main antagonist before it's too late, but another point can be brought up, who really is the \"good guy\" in the world of Psycho Pass? This gray area is another point of the story as both sides have relevant points for why they believe what they are doing is right, but some are willing to sacrifice more to accomplish what they see right than others. This question of morality and do the ends justify the means as well as the gray areas of morality are some of the many important questions the series delves in to.\nThe art of the show is very crisp as well as the use of 3D animation, but some dips can be seen later in the series. However, it still looks gorgeous and I do not believe it detracts from the experience. The sound is quite good as well, especially the openings and in particular the endings, which always seem to start playing at just the time.\nAkane Tsunemori is our main heroine of the series and shows a large transformation throughout the series. she begins as the typical rookie cop who has a heart of gold and beliefs in true justice as well as not taking the lives of latent criminals. As the show goes on she shows her strong moral compass as well as the fact that she is not willing to stray from her own ideals in dangerous situations, and begins to show that she is a very competent detective. Akane is an interesting character to watch change as she learns from her mentor Kogami and decides to work from within the system to bring change.\nKogami is an enforcer, which means that he is a latent criminal who helps Inspectors capture latent criminals so that the Inspectors can keep their hues bright and colorful. He is a crack detective and is very smart, something that is shown by his references with he main antagonist that may leave the viewer feeling that they are on the outside looking in. He shows little development throughout the series and starts the same way he ends, a great detective who is willing to do whatever he deems necessary to administer justice and what he deems right.\nGinoza is a Inspector who is also competent but has the nagging fear that his hue will become clouded, something that has happened to his family before. His downfall as the story progress is interesting to watch, and his conversations with certain enforcers as well as his scenes during the final conflict are intriguing. The characters of psycho pass can be easily broken up, one who is working their way up in society, one on the way down, one who has been rejected by society, and one who has rejected society.\nOverall I immensely enjoyed Psycho Pass as a series and would recommend it too almost anyone. Its not a perfect series but is pretty damn close, but as the show teaches us, striving for absolute perfection can have some severe consequences.\n"},

Also, I only watched the Dub, so evaluation of the subbed version might be different... slightly. **\nIf you've seen Minority Report and you're thinking \"This is just like that.\" You're... close at best. Yes, it does have the same basic premise. And it's obviously inspired by the same source material as that film. They quote a lot of different literary works in this and Phillip K. Dick is included, who did happen to author the short story\n          \n        Minority Report is based on.\nThis reminded me a lot more of Production IG's other franchise, Ghost in the Shell. I kept waiting for the reveal that Akane was actually a full body cyborg, or some new type android. Oh god, I was actually hoping that was going to be the explanation for the terrible character design... which... was the main snag for me when I started watching this series.\nIf you're bothered by the primitive design of Akane (The female MC) just bear with it. I got the feeling as the show went on that this was actually lending to some symbolism about her naive perception and youth. Whatever... Anime directors do weird things, and I'm not certain now how the series would have fared with a grittier looking MC in her place. I mean... She definitely sticks out as her art style, particularly her obscenely large eyes contrast the otherwise realistically proportioned characters. Just trust me, it works in the end. Anime is art... So onto art:\nART- 7/10\nI thought the series featured a good blend of CGI with traditional animation, but there was some lacking flow in action sequences and character proportions. It's really good, but it's no masterpiece. And as stated above, some of the female characters seemed to have designs from a completely different genre of anime (children's) where the others were more realistic. (I forget what the Shounen/Sienen terms mean. You can blow me.) I liked the Warhol-esque feeling of the 2nd opening sequence. I think that's one of my favorites of all time now.\nSound- 8/10\nThe voices in the dub were great. I personally love Brina Palencia, and I thought her voice paring with the character was a little odd, but I couldn't help loving it anyway. The OPs and EDs were good, though I have to say the 2nd set were superior.\nCharacter- 8/10\nIn some stories characters grow change and progress. In other stories you learn more and more about characters as the plot moves along. In this anime, you get both. Some characters progress and learn things about themselves, as others reveal things about their past. Psycho-Pass isn't the kind of story where there is a clear moral high-ground. Yes, there are villains, and there are certainly heroes. But at the end of the day (and this is something I love about these types of stories and why I draw a parallel with GitS) there is no black and white clear-cut right and wrong. It's hard to come away from this not liking some of the characters, but I will admit a few of them are just expendable junk that could be anyone. At least these types in the show are given enough of their own flavor to keep them from being nameless. They could have easily added a couple episodes to explore a couple of the side characters, but I have to say, I'm fine with it the way it is.\nEnjoyment and story- 9/10\nI tend to binge watch anime. And I'm glad I didn't have to wait through cliffhangers and try to remember some points over months as the series aired. If you like Ghost in the Shell, Sci-Fi, Cyberpunk, police drama, or even Noir, you'll likely enjoy this one.\nThe dystopia depicted in Psycho-Pass isn't so much of a dystopia to the people who live in it. And I think that's something some of us from the USA might not really get. I think I get a lot more out of shows that make me think. I liked and appreciated the various literary references throughout, and I felt they were relevant to the story. This was well thought out and well crafted, and it's only in being very critical that I don't rate the show higher.\nThis was adapted into Manga and a second season/series was created which I will definitely be watching. So in an effort to keep this spoiler free/light I won't divulge the plot points, but it certainly takes the concept to a new level and it's worth a watch.\nOverall- 8/10\nI felt like they could have done more in certain areas. And I felt like I was watching two shows mashed together with the character design/art sometimes, and I didn't think it was necessary. I really have to pick at it because I did enjoy this show a lot.\nIs it a masterpiece? No. But that doesn't mean it's any less enjoyable.\nThere are parts of this anime that are damn good. There are parts of it that could easily be improved. Just watch it. I'm pretty sure if you have any appreciation for the genre then you'll really enjoy this show."},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    I watched this anime over a period of time (was an on and off thing for me) so please excuse me if I type a character's name wrong (lol I was never good at memorizing long and convoluted Japanese names). I will start off by saying that I had pretty a pretty high expectation for this anime because my friend couldn't stop lauding it. To put simply, this is one of her all time favorites. She just would not stop talking about how much she liked it! I...welll, both liked and disliked the anime. Even though I enjoy anime associated with such themes as psychological\n          \n        and thriller, this anime was a bit gory/bloody for me due to its violent content (yea, go ahead and scoff at me, I'm a scaredy cat). \nPros:\n- What I liked about this anime is the rapid CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Akane grows from a timid and naive girl to a super badass and resolute protagonist who oozes with confidence. Kagomi is intelligent and encouraging. Actually he is probably one of my favorite characters in this anime (along with the old detective, that is). I actually didn't like Ginoza in the beginning. He is the embodiment of a \"Sibyl\" man- meaning he follows his boss' orders without any hesitation. He as the living definition of \"societal expectations\". He doesn't question the sibyl system, even though there is something horribly wrong with it (and there are moments when he doubts Sibyl but doesn't take action). However, as the story unfolds, his point of view changes and he starts to doubt the system. This is especially evident in his swapping of Kogami with Enforcers from Division 2. To me, that was his turning point. I guess I do kind of understand where he's coming from... he is acting this way because he doesn't want to make the same mistake as his father did. Speaking of his father (who is known as the \"old hunting dog\" of Division one), the last scene where Ginoza and Masaoka embraced each other is simply heart-rendering. The emotions delivered via the scene were just...overflowering and powerful.\nThere are also moments when Masaoka and Ginoza get together on the balcony and Masaoka gives him fatherly advice. Masaoka is probably my favorite character in this anime because he is so real and human. He is portrayed as a fatherly figure who guides everyone, including Akane (who ultimately learns to guide herself), Kogami, and Ginoza. He stands for everything that the Sibyl system is not. He believes in...well, the \"human\" process (lol). I just have so much respect for him. \n(On an irrelevant side note, Maosaka's his relationship with Ginoza actually reminds me of me and my father's. We were never friendly/close with each other and I would often ignore him. But deep down I know that he cares for me. I truly do (lol the heartwarming/cheesy confession of an eighteen year old teenage girl). When Masaoko told Ginoza that...well, his son is more important than anything else, I teared up. Why? Because Ginoza (I) always treated his father with apathy and indifference. Yet, Maosaka (my father) still loves and protects him (/me) with all his might. Yep. This anime made me mull over my \"complicated\" relationship with my dad.)\n- As a huge fan/lover of literature, I definitely enjoyed Makishima's literary insights. He does raise a lot of really good points about foibles of Sibyl system (and, in a broader sense, human nature). And I kind of sympathized with him when I realized that his crimes stem from his solitude. He was never loved. Treated as an outcast. Doesn't even know what happiness is. What a poor, poor soul. (But that does not make the crimes he committed excusable!)\n- There is a good balance of fighting/action scenes and investigation scenes! (Not to mention touching moments)\n- Makishima's final death scene is just...wow. So divine. Sacred. Pristine. The way he walked doggedly, dragging his bloody and scarred body across the tranquil wheat field. With elegant classical music playing in the background. If you mute your laptop, you'll think the scene is filled with the sound of Makishima panting due to the weight of his body and the pain inflicted by his fresh wound. However, if you watch this scene with the sound on, the elegant and lofty music sharply contrasts with his 'dogged' image. In his final scene, he kneels down and stretches his arm, which clearly alludes to the Crucified Christ figure. The scapegoat. It was just so holy and pristine...and it almost seems as if he already foresaw his death. It seems like...he was dying for the 'sin' of mankind. Also, the artist only shows us Mak's back when he was shot by Kogami. This is a very, very interesting dierctor's choice/angle. (For those film zealots out there, this is similar to Ingmar Bergman's Virgin Spring...Bergman chose to focus on figure's back as opposed to front to heighten emotional intensity. Plus I think having the viewer imagine what the person's last expression is is more powerful than simply showing the viewer what his/her expression is) \n- Quite a few characters died in this anime. Akane's friend, Masaoka, one of the younger enforcers...and, well, Kogami who \"escaped\" from 'confinement'. I think this is one of the many reasons that sets this anime apart from conventional animes. A lot of characters died. Yes, I am emotionally attached to them. But when they died, I was not frustrated/angry or bitter. Everything just seemed so natural. They died for a purpose. They were all fighting for the same cause. \n- AMAZING graphic! Music wasn't exactly my style but fitted the anime's overall theme. \nCons:\n- I didn't watch season 2 yet (and I don't intend on watching it) but I kind of wished Kogami could appear in season 2. Also, I really wanted to know what happened to Kogami after he killed Makishima (since he doesn't appear in season 2 at ALL!)\n- I feel like the plot could have unfolded faster. I mean, I definitely enjoyed watching the 'middle episodes' of the anime where the squad works together and solves interesting crimes. But it would have been much better if...there was a little more tension/suspense? The middle episodes feel rather episodic (meaning they are not really connected to each other. Kind of like still-life/slice of life paintings, if you will). \n- There are too many important details left unexplained. Even though I liked Akane's character development, I feel like everything happened too fast. Her dominator shows her the true form of sibyl system, and suddenly BANG. There. She undergoes a spectacular metamorphosis and becomes a super badass inspector. Suddenly, she grasps the situation and starts to think like Kogami. I was particularly taken aback when she presented her 'analysis' of health adminstrator's killing (in one of the later episodes). She did not even base her analysis on the evidence presented. I mean she did, but the evidence was not strong enough. She just shared her analysis of the murder and Kogami's hidden intention based on SPARSE (literally non-existent) evidence eloquently and NO ONE questioned her. They just nodded and went, \"oh yea, she's smart, damn! didn't think of that!\" But I mean really? Maybe it's because I read too much crime fiction but girl you need to base. your. argument. on. firm. evidence. \nALL IN ALL, this was a good anime. But to me, it was not AMAZING. Sure, the artist explores some really interesting themes that center on the dark side of human nature. But it just didn't wow me in anyway. However, the graphic is amazing, not to mention the rapid character development. Thus, I shall rate this an 8/10!\n"},

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    - English Review (Translated version)\nWith \"Psycho-Pass\" something quite surprising and frustrating has happened to me. In theory, when I started to see it, it had all the ingredients to be an anime that would become part of my favorites: dystopian future, science fiction, dark environment, thriller style... All elements that attract me greatly in anime in particular and in any story in general. The problem has been that then in practice... it hasn't been like that, I miss something, it doesn't attracting me, it doesn't reach to glued me to the screen.\nThe initial framework is interesting. It is true that at first it gives the\n          \n        impression that we are going to be faced with a procedural series of crimes, in the style of american television series such as Criminal Minds or CSI. In a few chapters it can already be seen that this is simply an introduction to something greater, to the real plot, which from then on becomes the central axis and turns the anime into something much deeper with a multitude of moral and philosophical conflicts.\nThe problem is not the plot, which is good. I think that the main cause of my lack of feeling is an unattractive rhythm and a way of developing scenes tremendously wasted. Another aspect with which I had a love/hate relationship has been the continuous mention of philosophical authors, literary works and other forms of culture. This is always good, the classical culture must be promoted whenever possible and in a product like anime is to thank this apparition. The fact is that they resort to this resource on so many occasions that it ends up bordering the thin line that separates cultural homage from pretentious pedantry.\nAs far as characters are concerned, despite having a very high level antagonist such as Makishima, I think that \"Psycho-Pass\" lacks not too much depth neither in protagonists (including Akane and Kougami, although a priori the protagonist is only Akane) nor in secondary. In spite of being a \"long\" series (22 episodes), they don't spend much time on getting to know in more detail the personalities, past events and motivations of almost characters. Most of these revelations are through simple dialogues and with little time spent with them. Interestingly, the only episode that is destined entirely to a character's past is to probably the most insignificant Enforcer of all, as is Kunizuka. Incomprehensible.\nThe technical section is not bad, but it doesn't stand out at all. Artistically everything looks beautiful and solid, but also generic and without much personality. I felt like I was watching Spike (Cowboy Bebop) in every Kougami scene. More of the same happens to the music section. Complicated to keep a memory of any of their melodies, because they do not differ too much from others already heard a thousand times. Openings and endings continue this stay in no-man's-land. If any of them stand out, I choose Ending 2, that is emotional and strong.\nAs I mentioned at the beginning, it was strange my \"Psycho-Pass\" view. What I didn't like is not something tangible, something concrete. These are subjective sensations. This, although it cannot be expressed in words at all well, is something that is absolutely valid for a review. Because actually this is all the important when we write them: expressing our feelings with a product. And these are mine.\n\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\nCon \"Psycho-Pass\" me ha ocurrido algo bastante sorprendente a la par que frustrante para mí. En teoría cuando empecé a verla tenía todos los ingredientes para ser un anime que entrara a formar parte de mis favoritos: futuro distópico, ciencia ficción, ambiente oscuro, estilo thriller... Todos elementos que me atraen sobremanera en el anime en particular y en cualquier historia en general. El problema ha sido que luego en la práctica... no ha sido así, me ha faltado algo, no me ha terminado de llegar, de atraerme, de pegarme a la pantalla.\nEl marco inicial es interesante. Cierto es que al principio da la sensación de que vamos a estar frente a una serie procedimental de crímenes, al estilo de series de televisión norteamericanas como Mentes Criminales o CSI. A los pocos capítulos ya se ve que esto simplemente es una introducción para algo mayor, para la verdadera trama, que a partir de entonces se convierte en el eje central y convierte el anime en algo bastante más profundo con multitud de conflictos morales y filosóficos.\nEl problema no es la trama, que es buena. Creo que el causante principal es un ritmo poco atractivo y una forma de desarrollar escenas (que no historia, no es lo mismo) tremendamente desaprovechada. Otro aspecto con el que he tenido una relación de amor/odio ha sido con las continuas menciones a autores filosóficos, obras literarias y otras formas de cultura. Esto siempre es bueno, la cultura clásica hay que promoverla siempre que sea posible y en un medio como el anime, no muy dado a ello, es de agradecer esta aparición. El caso es que recurren a este recurso en tantas ocasiones que se acaba bordeando la delgada línea que separa el homenaje cultural de la pedantería pretenciosa.\nEn cuanto a personajes, a pesar de contar con un antagonista de muchísimo nivel como es Makishima, creo que \"Psycho-Pass\" adolece de no demasiada profundidad ni en protagonistas (incluyo a Akane y a Kougami, aunque a priori la protagonista sea solo Akane) ni en secundarios. A pesar de ser una serie \"larga\" (22 capítulos), apenas dedican tiempo para conocer con más detalle las personalidades, hechos pasados y motivaciones de casi ningún personaje. La mayoría de estas revelaciones son mediante simples diálogos y sin apenas dedicarles tiempo alguno. Curiosamente el único capítulo que destinan entero al pasado de un personaje es probablemente al Ejecutor más intrascendente de todos, como es Kunizuka. Incomprensible.\nEl apartado técnico se queda a medio gas. No es malo, pero no destaca en absolutamente nada. Artísticamente todo luce bonito y sólido, pero también genérico y sin mucha personalidad. Me daba la sensación de estar viendo a Spike de Cowboy Bebop en cada escena de Kougami. Al apartado musical le ocurre más de lo mismo. Complicado guardar recuerdo de ninguna de sus melodías, porque no difieren demasiado de otras ya oídas mil veces. Los openings y los endings continúan esta estancia en tierra de nadie. De destacar alguno, me quedaría con el Ending 2: emotivo y con fuerza.\nComo comenté al principio, ha sido extraño mi visionado de \"Psycho-Pass\". Lo que menos me ha gustado no es algo tangible, algo concreto, algo palpable... son sensaciones subjetivas. Esto, aunque no se pueda expresar del todo bien con palabras, es algo totalmente válido para una review. Porque en realidad se trata de eso cuando las escribimos: de expresar nuestras sensaciones con un producto. Y éstas son las mías.\n        "},

It depicts the setting perfectly.  The distopian society is stunning and if you don't like the art than there is always the animation.  The action scenes are nor always the coolest but when the director had money to spend on it you can DEFINITELY tell.  By the way, the animation for the dominators make me want to get my head\n          \n        blown off by them.  There is no doubt that the art gets a perfect 10.\n2.Sound - UUUUUHHHHH!  The soundtrack is so good!  This is one of the only soundtracks I can confidently say I can listen to all the way through.  This is a perfect example of how a soundtrack is meant to sound.  It adds emotion where it is needed according to what is happening on-screen and in the story.  When there is an action scene the music also takes action with loads of suspense.  Likewise, when the story hits an emotional point the music flows super well with it.  I have ABSOLUTELY no problem with the sound for this anime.  A perfect 10/10.\n3.Character - The characters for this anime were fricken’ awesome.  Each of them were unique and I had no trouble with their personalities.  The only thing that bothered me was that some characters didn’t get any back story, but in the end it didn’t really matter.  The relationship between Mr. Kogami and the main villain (which I can not remember the name of) was beautiful.  They flowed with each other in a way that made you think they were neither serial-killer or detective, it was simply amazing.  I have to give props to that but for a little lack of back story I have to give an 8 for character.\n4.Story - What’s not to say about this story, it was spectacular.  It made me despise, it made me lust for blood, and it involved me in it’s distopian world better than most animes I’ve watched have. The only problem with the story is that there are some kinks left after the last episode but there is also Psycho Pass 2 for that.  The story was amazing but for some kinks I can only give it a 9.\n5.Enjoyment - I haven’t enjoyed an anime this much in forever and I was totally addicted to watching it when I started.  I honestly think that this this anime is underrated and it deserves more respect.  I straight up loved this anime and it gets a definite 10 for enjoyment.\nThis anime is an overall 10\n*I will also recommend that this anime is only watched by a matured audience.\nCaution:\n!Keep in mind this anime has very intense gore.\n!Keep in mind this anime has dark subject matter.\n"},

Its a well written show with intruiging philosophy and good creative story telling .  The first thing I will address about the show is what to expect . Psycho-Pass has a setting where you can scan peoples brain waves which they express with the term 'Psycho-Pass' and judge if they are fit for society or a certain type of work . It is set in the future and explores the content of its own setting throughout the show . Basically\n          \n        the people who have high crime co-efficiency are treated like monsters and they are deprived of their social rights . Living in a society full of flaws and that being something strong enough to shape the behaviour of people in general , psycho-pass deals with the conflict sorrounding the question \"What would be an ideal society ?\" . It uses several literary references to pay tribute to the writers that most likely inspired the writer of this show . Other than being a good psychological , psycho-pass has its fair share of action to keep the fanbase of that genre intrigued with a few good hand to hand combats. \nArt and Sound : There's not much to complain about the psycho-pass production . They did a pretty good job with the animation and sound . Which is one of the reasons people can enjoy the show in the first place .\nCharacters :I really enjoyed this aspect of the show despite it not being able to do justice to most of its characters .But 3 characters standout pretty well which is in most cases enough to make up for everyone else . Psycho-pass had a unique cast of characters based on the setting of the show . Kogami is a fan favourite for obvious reasons as he is the badass dude carrying the thriller aspects of the show .  The action , the conflicted conversations , solving mysteries - Kogami takes central stage in all of this . His presentation is pretty simply and has a strong delivery . \nThe main protagonist of the franchise Akane is one of those over idealistic characters people can hate . But if you take a better look at the show you will find how important , she is . Akane takes central stage in coming up with answers sorrounding the social conflict that is seen on the show . Although she doesn't come with an absolute solution , it is shown through her that taking things for the way they are and improving on it is the only way to solve your problems . She is the final piece in the psychological aspects of this show when her development is at its prime . Through Akane's own conflicts people can truly view the beauty of psycho-pass and it feels like a complete show staying true to some realistic political and social variables .\nAnd finally the third character I am going to praise is the main antagonist of season 1 'Shougo Makishima' . What would you call a great villain ? Is it someone the people can enjoy watching ? Well did you ever consider it may hurt the true purpose of the show if you end up cheering for the villain ? It is important for most shows that the villain draws hate . Makishima is a character who is very easy to hate . At the same time , he has the 'it factor' and charisma to draw the audience to enjoy the show as well . Basically Makishima is perhaps the real reason psycho-pass is as good as it is in the first place.  Not only does he contribute to the psychological aspects of the show bringing out the reasons of conflict itself but he also contributes to the more casual ways to draw audience . \nDislikable content :\nConvenient writing : since psycho-pass explores its own settings , it has plenty of convenient storytelling to tell the audience whatever it wants because they can justify that by modifying the setting itself . If you loved Code Geass I believe this won't bother you at all .But one more area it does affect is  the mystery sorrounding the show . People like to use their own head to solve mysteries but because of the appraoch of this show that isn't possible .\nPacing : The earlier episodes are pretty boring as they take a long time explaining the setting . Its very hard to watch the show until the psychological conflicts begin to show up . Thankfully episode 4 onwards the show is a bit more interesting. But in the end the show decides to not evolve and do a season 2 with weaker elements of season 1 . The ending remains weak and you wonder if the promise the show sets really delivers in the end.\nNudity : what does this offer other than making the show annoying .\nOverused Soundtrack : As I said before the soundtrack is a valuable part of the show . But its a little bit too valuable as the show tries to make ordinary scenes mean much more by playing a music .

Yes of course some of you may have thought that they were dragging the story and left the story off unclearly for second season and the movie.

Another great part of this anime lied on use of BGMs as it was so perfectly suited for the anime.\nI would recommend this anime to those of you who enjoy mysteries, SF, and those of you who watch anime for story.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    The basic concept of Psycho-Pass is a dystopian society where freedom becomes controlled and limited. The system, Sibyl system, is able to determine ones \"Psycho-Pass\" by accessing the mind of an individual instantaneously. Psycho-Pass allows an individual's likelihood of committing a crime in the future to be recorded and measured. It seems like ideal in the name of justice, however finding loopholes in the system can throw society into dismay.\nPsycho-Pass explores many social and psychological themes. The concept of punishing someone because they have the potential to do wrong is explored regularly. Should someone be punished because someone has the thoughts but never act upon\n          \n        them? How does having a different state of mind effect one's Psycho-Pass? Emotions are repressed to not be able to feel negative emotions, as the majority of the criminals are emotionally unstable. The job of the police force becomes restricted; if they attempt to think like the criminals , it only increases their chances of becoming a criminal. Because of these limitations in life, living becomes restricted.\nThe primary male protagonist, Shinya Kougami is an enforcer who is obsessed with Makishima, and cannot move on without setting things right. An Enforcer is a rank in the police force, whose job is to be the 'dog' and sniff out the criminal. Kougami's character development is practically non-existent. This is because Kougami has his sight set to the end of the road, shown by his justified and unwavering personality. Thus he is already established into someone who knows what he is doing from the get go. He is intelligent, rational, logical and is a capable fighter, which doesn't leave much room for development. Instead Psycho-Pass relies on the development of Akane, and to some extent, the secondary cast.\nThe female lead, Tsunemori Akane goes through moments that change her perspectives on society as she tries to find her purpose of life. Her main influence is from Kougami as she shows admiration for his resolve and detective skills. Akane's own ideals are not as clear nor well developed enough to understand the choices made by some characters. Her lack of understanding the situation clouded her judgement. Shown her conflict for the Sibyl system, it brings harmony but restricts freedom, and becomes confused. However, once she does find her resolve, she has an interesting and drastic change in character; making her as capable as Kougami and Makishima. \nThe antagonist, Shougo Makishima is political criminal who takes advantage of the faults that lie in civilization, structured by the Sibyl System. Similarly to Kougami, his character is already developed and takes on his own ethics of freedom. But to obtain his view of 'freedom' he must go against the law and order of the Sibyl system. His actions are purely brutal, but he sees no wrong in his own actions as they are 'normal' to him. Kougami's and Makishima's thought patterns are constantly compared since 'great minds think alike’. They become natural oppositions, but have different viewpoints of justice.\nThe growth of a single individual is not enough for almost any 26 episode series and thus Psycho-Pass turn its attention towards the secondary characters. Majority of the secondary cast have a back story, which differs in length. But these characters serve as a backdrop to more smaller and personal issues, and have a minimal role in the bigger picture. It does a good job of creating affinity to specific figures who excel from the rest of the secondary cast, but they still don't compare with the main cast.\nThere are some negatives with Psycho-Pass, such as the slow start. It takes time for it to build up and create development and the latter half of the series is better. The first half is broken into detective cases which some feeling dragged out and have uninteresting antagonists. The cases really exist to demonstrate how formidable Makishima is, and thus the lesser antagonists are squandered. The message is the same throughout the 22 episodes and some episodes are made specifically to enhance the idea of freedom versus the Sibyl system. Psycho-Pass never leaves this concept, but instead expands it  into fine detail. While it is an interesting idea, it could have explored other areas of human nature for at least some of the 22 episodes. \nThe art style goes well with the dark tone of Psycho-Pass. Close up shots have a bigger effect on tension, while long range shots influence the atmosphere. The medium shots aren't anything special and the character models, at times, are lacking in quality. The soundtrack is good, and offers a lot. There are pieces which contrast to the moment and others which captivate and enhance the situation. The 'openings' and 'endings' look and sound brilliant.\nPsycho-Pass is definitely worth watching and purposely didn't reveal all its cards for the chance of a second season. It does have its flaws but it is still a unique anime which explores the mental state of human beings.\n\"The law doesn't protect people, people protect the law.\" -Akane\n        "},

These are the essential questions laid down in the series.\nStory:\nIn this forte,Psycho-Pass is a masterpiece.Not that it does not have some flaws but the interesting and catchy story makes up for it all.It is a science-fiction anime and a gem in the genre because of the simple reason that the story never loses focus.You don't get the feeling of a loose end at any point.A machine that utilizes humans only to suppress them,that is actually trying to convert humans into mindless puppets of the law with its mechanical analysis of a person's Crime Coefficient(a number which indicates one's probability to commit a crime obtained by scanning their brain) constitutes a fairly solid and gripping story line.\nThe story progresses in a nice manner and gives just the right space to connect all the dots.When Akane and her Enforcer,Kogami, face adverse situations,a tension builds up as one tries to predict whether their ideals will match or clash which contributes to the story's growth The cat and mice hide-and-seek game between Kogami and his colleagues and Shogo Makishima,the criminal mastermind,two factions having opposing ideals is intriguing and does not fade out in the long run.There are ample twists and shocks throughout to keep one engaged.\nThe ending is quite clear and open leaving ample issues for a second season.The second season can be and hopefully,should be a continuation rather than a new story with a new cast as a good deal of questions remain unanswered.What happens to Kogami after he achieves his goal?Does the Sibyl system get its way in the end?How does Akane and the Inspector-turned-enforcer Ginoza change in the future and what path do they follow? It also remains to be seen that the ever-doubting Akane who challenges Sibyl's authourity at every step,fights back or not.Moreover,there is a lesbian love scene between Shion and Kunizuka at the very end whose significance needs to be explored.These issues need to be adressed. Overall,the story line is thrilling and modern and thought-provoking enough to be value for money and time.\nAnimation: \nAnimation is fluid and satisfying and the futuristic gadgets and city-styled landscapes are well-portrayed.Art work is quite good as you will be able to see when you look at the characters.The Dominator design and other such things are especially good.\nSound:\nThe voice-actors have done a good job and are able able to covey the emotions seamlessly.The Honourable Mention goes to Ling for his uber cool techno opening theme song 'Abnormalize'.The song connects intimately with the theme of the series and after you have watched the first few eps,you will be at a high chance of falling in love with it.Its unique and catchy and innovative.\nThe second opening by 'Nothing's Carved in Stone' is an okay deal.\nEgoist's ending theme songs are nice but as usual all of Eogist's songs sound nearly the same,even the tune but they are soulful regardless.\nCharacter: \nCharacter development is the one of the strongest points of the anime.Right from the start you can feel Akane and Kogami's character gradually evolving with their backgrounds being revealed in an enjoyable pace.Even amidst all the frenzy,you never lose sight of how the character grows as a person and how societal influences end up shaping him.The slight breeze of love(mixed with admiration) between Kogami and Tsunemori touches the heart.Even the relation between Ginoza and father is very unique,more so because Ginoza himself meets the same fate as his father and finally learns to respect him.With the progress of the story,each of the characters have veen nicely sketched and can be picturized vividly.You can feel what's going on in their minds.Characters are more than just virtual avatars here.\nEnjoyment:\nIt delivers high on this point.Right from the beginning,the catchy storyline grasps you and you can feel a suspense build up and sense that something interesting is about to happen.The plus point is that it doesn't bore at any point and keeps you addicted.There is loads of action for the battle lovers,tons of futuristic techs for the gizmo freaks and for the avid thinker,there are lots of moral questions and phisolosophical tunes that arise which sets you thinking and questioning the basic definitions of 'good' and 'bad','right' and 'wrong'.So,even if you don't like it,whatever be the reason,you won't complain of boredom or repetativeness.\nConclusion:\nPsycho-Pass is a gem in the science fiction genre.It is an enjoyable watch right from the start and though the ending is kind of vague(we can only hope for a sequel to explain the rest),the total package that it provides in such a short series definitely puts it up for recommendation and applaud.If you are looking for something with an original and good story and at the same time catchy and adrelanine-pumping,go for this one.Even if it doesn't become a favourite,it will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    **Note: This review contains a few mild spoilers and some hints about the series. If you’d like to go in completely unspoiled, you can just skip to the “Overall” section at the end.\nStory – 8.5/10\nAt what price comes security? The people of Japan in Psycho-Pass have willingly given up many freedoms for what appears at the outset to be a perfect system: impartial machines, run by the centralized Sibyl System, judge the psychological wellness of every citizen, assigning a “hue” to their mental make-up and a number to their “crime coefficient,” a measure of how likely they are to commit violent criminal acts. Individuals with\n          \n        a cloudy hue and a high crime coefficient are incarcerated and treated, or—if their number is high enough—killed. Some latent criminals are selected to become Enforcers, working under Inspectors who use their criminal knowledge to track down dangerous psychopaths. Meanwhile, regular citizens live with a feeling of complete safety, and have their futures set in stone by the Sibyl system, which can assess which jobs they would be best suited for.\nOne of Psycho-Pass’s greatest victories is its ability to portray both sides of this world. On the one hand, most citizens largely accept the system as-is, given the safety they feel and the extent to which Sibyl’s ideology has seeped into their everyday lives; on the other hand, the show wastes almost no time before it begins to critique this system. Many characters voice concerns about the dystopic and totalitarian elements of Sibyl, including and especially the main character, Akane, and the antagonist, Makishima. This is a series fully invested in exploring the ethical and moral ramifications of the society it depicts, which certainly elevates the story itself above what you might expect from what is ostensibly an action series.\nFrequent references to philosophers—Michel Foucault even gets name-dropped at one point, speaking about (what else) the panopticon—raise this subtext into text, and that the villain of the series is consciously working to subvert the Sibyl system allows for theme to marry plot, action, and character in a way that is more or less seamless, even if most of the questions it raises go unanswered. Still, that’s not necessarily a bad thing: for a series as much concerned with “big ideas” as it is with action and character, it makes sense not to resolve those ideas, which are after all largely unresolverable anyway. It’s enough that the story of Psycho-Pass does an excellent, if ultimately imperfect, job of examining philosophical debates through the actions of its characters and its extremely well though-out dystopic world.\nAll of this means that it’s difficult to separate plot from theme here, which is one reason why the extent to which you’re able to buy into some of the mid-season twists will ultimately depend, at least in part, on how invested you are in the philosophical underpinnings of the series. To me, the twists make sense from that perspective, and add new wrinkles to the ideas being examined in the series; even a certain character's decisions near the end, which grow somewhat questionable, make sense if viewed from the right direction. It’s not always completely satisfying, but I can’t say the ending was anticlimactic; indeed, I can’t think of a much more fitting end given the questions being asked here. That having been said, I also can’t help but feel as though some characters’ personalities and actions were dictated by those questions, rather than the other way around. In the end I found the story engrossing and justifiable, but just know going in that you might not end up feeling the same way!\nAnimation – 8/10\nGreat animation! The best quality is the world the designers have cooked up, which feels lived-in and which a friend of mine compared—quite rightly, I think—to Blade Runner. The Dominators, powerful multi-purpose guns used by Inspectors and Enforcers, are extremely badass. Character designs are nothing particularly special, but at least (most of) the women aren’t too fanservicey!\nSound – 8.5/10\nThe soundtrack is generally pretty fabulous, and I even got a few of the musical cues stuck in my head (humming one right now, in fact). I watched the dub and I found it to be generally quite impressive—no voice stuck out at me as particularly awful. I found Robert McCollum (Kougami) and Alex Organ (Makishima) to be most impressive, with both actors finding the right balance in characters that were complex and oftentimes contradictory. Organ perhaps deserves special kudos for not turning Makishima into your standard self-righteous pontificating villain trope. Sound effects are generally quite good and often very gruesome; this is as good a place as any to warn you that this series isn’t for the faint of heart!\nCharacters -- 8.5/10\nThe characters here are generally well-developed and intriguing, with Kougami and Makishima being the obvious standouts. I also appreciate the series’ commitment to interesting and complex female characters (the show passes the Bechdel test by episode 2, if I’m not mistaken), including the protagonist, Akane Tsunemori, whose undergoes perhaps the most drastic and welcome character arc of the series (the only real challenger to that title is a character whose name I won’t reveal, to preserve the surprise of where he/she ends up). The series even has some good LGBT representation, a welcome surprise!\nOverall – 8.5/10\nI really enjoyed Psycho-Pass, from the animation to the characters to the great story. If nothing else, it's a great action series, a great detective story, and has enough philosophical bite to give you something to chew on after it’s done. I’d say if you’re on the fence, go ahead and take the plunge.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I must admit that, when I started watching this anime I had no expectations what-so-ever. I was just looking for something to kill my boredom and what I found was so much more than just that. Psycho-Pass is not only one of the best anime of the season but also one of the best anime I have ever watch. \nTaking place in the somewhat near future, Psycho-Pass presents a dystopian society in which it is possible to accurately quantify an individual's emotions, skills, abilities and, most importantly, predisposition to crime and state of mind. Therefore, one's place and role in society are being decided by\n          \n        these quantifications, measured by the mysterious Sibyl System, which add up to what people call a Psycho-Pass.\nThe story revolves around a team of police officers, divided into detectives and enforcers. The detectives are those who have been deemed capable of discovering and capturing criminals and potential criminals while the enforcers are latent criminals (people who, despite not having committed any crime, have been imprisoned due to high values of their psycho-passes) who have two roles here. First, thanks to the skills they possess they are allowed to work with the detectives to solve crimes as an alternative to spending their lives into a cell, and second, since their psycho-passes are already beyond recovery, they are being used by the detectives in order for them not to become latent criminals too.\nThe characters are very well-constructed in my opinion as, watching this anime, you will start feeling sympathy towards them, you will judge them, you will pity them and even be proud of their actions. Such realistic characters can easily stir many emotions inside your heads and each of them is well introduced into the story and has their own role, being defined better and better by each decision they take. \nAs far as the art goes, I believe everything is really well done and presented in this anime. The characters seem to have a certain look, representing each of their personality while the disturbing feeling of a society where everything is but an illusion is being subtly highlighted. The action scenes are also well-sketched and, unlike many other anime, very few exaggerations are being done.\nThe music is very well chosen for this anime and I'd rather not say too much other than the fact that I couldn't have hoped for better intros or endings.\nI have to say that I really enjoyed this anime so far and I'm sure I'll be enjoying it at least as much until it ends. Many episodes have kept me from sleeping at night because I kept thinking about what would happen next, as well as about the subtle philosophical themes introduced in the story. \"Would people really benefit from such a society?\", \"Is it morally right to deprive someone of their freedom just because he is prone to committing a crime?\", \"Can a life led under a system like Sibyl really be called a free life?\" This kinds of question have been haunting my mind more and more since I started watching this anime and I couldn't have wished for a better cure to my boredom.\nAll in all:\nStory: 10\nArt: 9\nSound: 10\nCharacter: 10\nEnjoyment: 10\nOverall: 10\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    Pscyho-Pass is an amazing science fiction action anime series. It has so many positives and so few negatives. It is an interesting concept in that people are slaves of their Psycho-Pass (an overall evaluation of your mental state with varying factors that are explained later in the story). Lives are determined by your mental/emotional/psychological health. The heroes of this story are \"latent criminals\" meaning their Psycho-Pass readings dictate that they can commit a pretty heavy crime at any given moment, but they are useful to the system as enforcers. They basically do the dirty work for the system. It's a very unique story, and it's\n          \n        really a must see.\nNow for the praise...\nThis series is visually stunning. The artwork and animation are very well aligned. It holds a consistent quality throughout the entirety of the series. The style of artwork was clean, and I loved the character models (though as with most series often times characters began to really look alike). I especially  enjoyed the dark feel while still being dazzled with bright colors. It helped the story easily switch tones when it needed to. The animation was also very fluid and I was very impressed to say the least. It really just carried an overall high quality.\nThe opening and closing theme music was very catchy and memorable. The music during each episode was scored very well (again at a high quality that paced perfectly with the animation), and it helped to re-enforce the emotional context of what was happening in the story as well. The voice acting was well done, and even characters that had a monotonous vibe still carried a lot of charisma. Charismatic characters, good voice acting, good music... it all sat very well from start to finish. \nThis series really shined in it's characters. It had several highly charismatic characters that were easy to get attached to. Most of them were extremely well developed, and the background stories were far from being interruptions (which tends to be a trend in a lot of these series I've noticed). I never once complained about having to see a background story, probably because they were timed well. It never felt like dragged out \"back-pedaling\" which was very refreshing. Each character had a dark side, but they were all very easy to like (including the villains). \nOn to the story... \nThis story was great. I loved most of it. There were times I wish it went in a slightly different direction and it does have a fairly open ending. One of the plot devices I wanted to see resolved was left open which is why I am only giving this series a 9 (but we're talking like a 95% here so it is a high 9). Those gripes aside, the story was told well and it developed at a good pace. It wasn't stuffed full of action, but the action scenes were actually used as story telling devices (imagine that). The entire concept leaves free will out of the equation so that humans can have a near perfect society. The ideology was questioned from the beginning, and even the characters that accepted the system voiced their concerns throughout. Victims could easily become targets, and it was the constant possibility of the unexpected happening that kept it very interesting. Overall it has a great concept and it's very well told. \nI really enjoyed Psycho-Pass, it was difficult waiting each week for the next episode. I will definitely be watching it again and again.\nIn short, this is a must see gem. Definitely one of the best this season, and I really hope to see a sequel series or follow up movies. I wouldn't be surprised. Check this anime out, it's definitely worth the watch.\n        "},

Thought, the writer of this anime, Gen Urobuchi didn't clearly specify how the so called \"Crime Coefficient\"  categorize each person, I assume that it was the Sibyl System that designates people's crime index by comparing a person's brain patterns from one the system's brains collection that it has, that were taken from criminals and the reason why Makishima's was safe from the system, despite of being a criminal, is that the system simply doesn't have in its collection the kind of brain pattern datum it has with other brains, so it wasn't surprising that the system wants him alive badly. For the characters, it was Kogami and Makishima who have the biggest part in this anime, since they do depict the typical cops and criminal kind of thing, I like the direction where Kogami is this super-cop who is determined to avenge the death of his partner/enforcer, only to become an enforcer himself due to his rising crime index, this is the part where one would sympathize  with him due to the fact that his former partner now boss Gino puts a leash on him and one would wish that he punches Gino for being an ass, as for Akane, she was this naive probie who seems to be a chip on the enforcers shoulder, but on the few remaining episodes of this anime she redeemed herself where there was this sudden role reversal where Gino is the follower and she's the pack leader. What makes this anime good was the main climax were Makishima finally met his end and now Kogami has to be on the run, so, here are my ratings for each of this anime's category:\nStory: Very Good 8.\nFull of action and awesome application of sci-fi, dystopia, thriller, action genres and a little bit of cyberpunk element .\nArt: Good 7.\nI like the futuristic designed and some of the few fanservice that includes Akane's one time panty shot and Shion X Yayoi after sex scene, though some uncensored boob flashes would be nice.  \nSound: Good 7. \nI like the way director, Naoyoshi Shiotani chooses the seiyuu's for the characters.\nCharacter: Very Good 8.\nEach character really did lived up to their expected role and the outcome of their roles.\nEnjoyment: Very Good 8.\nThe dénouement  of this anime is what makes this anime something to be excited about and combine will the well executed  Jo-ha-kyū, especially the swift ending of Makishima  as Kogami finishes him off,  one would feel that sign of relief that it was over for that psychopath.\nOverall: Very Good 8.\nOverall, it was all good, thought there is still the Sibly System that has to be eliminated, we can only hope that there will be a continuation of some sort of this anime, which Kogami will be the one to pull the plug on Sibyl System, because if there is the main antagonist from this anime that would be the said system, let's face it technically speaking that is the scenario where machines are ruling over the human race and the human race was too dumb to even know about it. \n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Before watching this series let me give you a definition of this two terms.\nPsycho-Pass - measurement of mental state of a person. It is represented in numerical value, and depending on the value it shows, it can determine whether you're a good or bad citizen, criminal or potential criminal etc etc.\nSibyl System - the system which is responsible for computing,analyzing and evaluation of psycho-pass.\n\nPsycho-pass isn't a series that's easy to watch. At first I really can't get a grip on this series. Aside from the good grapichs, all I see are cons. \n- the female main character, she's naive, and does things that makes her\n          \n        look like an outstanding idiot.\n- a stunning character introduction. Stunning in a negative way. I mean no one can easily tell who is who if they suddenly introduced 8(more or less) characters in just a single episode. Of course, nobody can tell which one will just be an extra/supporting character at the start of a series.\n- aside from the stunning character introduction, there are also technical terms that will give you additional confusion such as psycho-pass, sibyl, paralyzer, dominator, crime coefficient, eliminator etc etc., which are also introduced in just a single episode.\n- the setting is very futuristic, rooms can change its interior design in an instant, change clothes in an instant, and even a gun with directional voice. It didn't impress me at all, it just gave me a big question mark on my head..\nGiven those 4 points i mentioned above, it gave me a hard time to continue watching, then after every episode it SEEMS to be episodic and has a repetitive cycle. But when I reached episode 6, the real deal starts(It was actually introduced earlier than episode 6 but it's not that noticeable). The story started to become a real crime thriller series. From episode 6 and onwards, the thrill and intensity of the series continue to rise. The first 5 episodes which at first I thought to be the episodic and weakest turns out to be essential to give the audience a grasp and familiarization to the modern world setting of the series. Then after that familiarization, the flow/pacing of things becomes stable and easy to understand, the main antagonist was introduced and little by little the mysteries with him unfolds. From the character's background, antagonist, system and its holes, crisis and problems(also internal conflicts), every detail is now presented in a well executed way which contributes to the thrill and enjoyment that this series gives you all the way up to its dejavu-ish ending. \nSo now just to sort some things out..\nstory(9) - I can simply describe its story as a police force vs. the main antagonist and his schemes set on a futuristic world/country. But what makes it so great is it stayed true and unique, it didn't tried to be something like death note or detective conan, the mysteries and details were enough to give the series a thrill. And this is a little spoiler but I atleast want to say it, this won't be similar to Sword Art Online that develops into a love story(cause some scenes are like hinting something like that), there will be no love story here, the story will be a straight forward sci-fi crime-thriller series.\nart(10) - the art was very good(kinda similar to Guilty Crown). From the details of the background, their guns and equipments(nice details), and the matured character art that fits the story. The only thing I don't like about the art is Akane's(female MC) face and her hairstyle, she really looks like a duck(but this is my own opinion so I disregarded this while giving it a score).\nsound(9) - aside from the dubbing, the background music was really good. It adds thrill to the chase and adds a very odd atmosphere while mysteries were revealed. And for the opening and ending song, I really can't give much comments about it since opinion about songs are subjective but the one that I really liked was the 2nd opening which is pure english.\nCharacter(10) - Majority of the characters are portrayed in a matured way(ofc they were police), and they have their own unique trait that gives them their own individuality. Even the main antagonist(he's so cool) and his subordinates has their own distinguishing personality. Each of the character has their own strength and remarkable aura/feel within them. The only character that I don't like here was Akane(female MC) again(still this is my own opinion/feeling so i disregarded it while giving it a score).\nEnjoyment(9) - Personally, I'm not a fan of a sci-fi series. I always see most of sci-fi series like -\"say what?\" or \"there is something like that? is that possible?\", but this series didn't relied on its futuristic theme but in more deeper look you'll see that this series focused more on the interpretation of the characters about law and justice. So the enjoyment of this series depends if you like a thriller series and a character driven series(I mean a story which focus on character's point of view). \nAnd my last words about this series, try to watch up to episode 6 or 7, cause that's where you can decide if you'll like this or not. \nThat's all\nThank you for reading!!!\n        "},

But if that truth threatened to destroy our sense of reality, would you still be able to accept it? Blindly, we ask for the truth at all costs, never fully understanding the price we agreed to pay. In Psycho-Pass, a series by the same series composer as Madoka Magica, Gen Urobuchi, I believe this to be the big picture question while watching, on the edge of my seat, as Inspector Akane Tsunemori delved into the truth of her own world. In this review, I shall delve into\n          \n        what I believe to be true of this anime.\nStory: 9\nFrom the first few seconds of the anime, we are thrown straight into the action where Akane Tsunemori, on her first day as an Inspector, has been called upon to assist in apprehending a dangerous man, as judged by a system that controls Society. She is told to do so using her subordinates known as Enforcers, latent criminals assisting in the protection of the law. While the story may seem like it starts out with random arrests, by the end all of these have either become important to the main plot of the story or important to character development. \nThe story starts out rather simplistically. Akane is tasked with arresting criminals, whether latent or current, because the Sibyl System tells her to and takes interest in Shinya Kougami, the seemingly most capable of the Enforcers. This goes on for the first few episodes and the gradually grows more and more complex. By the end, I found myself turning the concepts over in my head multiple times before it all made sense.\nArt: 10\nPsycho-Pass' art has everything I think a sci-fi police anime should have. I was immediately pulled in by the amazing details in the illustration of the city, both outside view and inside view. As promised by Urobuchi, this anime is devoid of any moe and many scenes can be quite cruel. I was not disappointed. I may sound like somewhat of a masochist here, but the fight scenes and crime scenes throughout the series were amazingly detailed and outstanding (as expected of Urobutcher).\nSound: 10\nThe OST of this anime is, in my opinion, the strongest point, if not art. OPs and EDs were very catchy and matched the show perfectly, but what really makes the OST great in Psycho-Pass is the music during the action, mystery, and philosophical points. Every event was matched superbly with music, even at points where a song that wasn't meant work with a certain event worked beautifully. In fact, the usage of the OST has probably become my favorite of any series, be it anime or not.\nCharacter: 9\nThe characters of this series always remind me of The Dark Knight. You have Inspector Akane Tsunemori, the face of justice, as Inspector Gordon, Shinya Kougami, the badass crime fighter without any rules, as Batman (aside from one rule), and Shougo Makishima, the badass villain who seeks to bring out humanities worst aspects, as the Joker. During the series, the characters are introduced pretty early on and thereafter develop in more detail, to the point where I felt like I actually knew each character, whether they were a supporting character or a main character; protagonist or antagonist.\nEnjoyment: 10\nI find that science fiction is always the toughest type of story to write. In order to write a true sci-fi masterpiece, one must have a thorough understanding of every scientific aspect that the incorporate into their story. That being said, I rarely encounter any true science fiction masterpieces. However, when I do, I'm certain of it, and Psycho-Pass is a science fiction masterpiece and worthy of a spot on my favorites list.\n        "},

The story will throw you, there are a number of surprises and some things you'll accept. Psycho-Pass is gripping in the fact that it knows how to play with your emotions. You get to feel like you know the characters so well that when something bad happens it hits you quite hard. Other than that this anime has several other things going for\n          \n        it.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    Some Spoilers Ensue:\nSo I went into this show late after hearing sooooo much about it and I must say, I came out impressed. It is a very intelligent, twisty, and ultimately fulfilling experience to watch. I enjoyed the numerous quotes and references to authors, along with the stunningly creative way said quotes and references were integrated into the plot.\nStory: It is ultimately a testament to humanity and what we believe to be a free and non-toxic society which ironically, we are wrong about here. The story centers around a new detective named Akane who comes to the task force right as a new/unfinished case starts\n          \n        bubbling. This futuristic world revolves around a system called Sybil which measures every person's \"Psycho-Pass\". That is, how insane they are. The task force works with people called Enforcers who are criminals that are either reformed, or want to help society. It starts out a bit slow setting the story up, but once the audience gets to officially meet the villain, everything becomes intensely enthralling.I loved it. Mikashima and Kogami's relationship brought back some Death Note nostalgia for sure. The entire last half of this anime was just a bucket of feelings. The Sybil system reveal was perfection and how Mikashima reacted was one of my favorite parts of the show. The twists kept coming, there were some very painful character deaths, and the grand finale felt final, and closed up the arc with ease. I am definitely looking forward to the next season.\nAnimation: I really enjoyed the backdrops and the drones along with all of the amazingly artistic approaches to the killings. It was rewarding to watch in HD and super colorful. The character designs were also quite nice and the fluid transitions from one scene to the next kept me engaged.\nSound: The best thing about this show, other than the story, was the sound. The brilliant use of classical music during intense scenes, the themes, and the voice acting formed a gorgeous cocktail and kept my emotions engaged. I had a hard time with some of the character deaths because the voice acting and animation was so on point. I also enjoyed both opening and ending themes, though I found the first two to be slightly better than the second two. Overall, the sound was a huge plus for me.\nCharacters: Where do I begin? Coming into the show, I didn't really like Akane because she seemed like a typical goody-two-shoes/useless girl, but as the show went on, her development was wonderful. The same goes for Ginoza. His character growth turned him into one of my favorite characters. Obviously, my two main favorites were Kogami and Mikashima, but other characters like Kagari and Masaoka were developed so well that their deaths led me to yell at my t.v. Mikashima is probably one of my favorite villains in any show because, though his views were skewed, he had purpose behind his actions. He was just bad ass and everything I want in villains. You don't side with them, but you see where they are coming from which is frightening and rewarding. Kogami's decent was an intriguing watch as well, because you felt his pain right along with him. Awesome.\nOverall: I was very happy with this experience and am excited to start the new arc. I would highly recommend this show.\n9.5/10.\nWatched Subbed."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Psycho Pass takes place in a dystopian Japan, where technology has been enhanced to actively monitor the very nature of human beings in attempts to measure how apt they are to commit crime. This technology is enforced by a criminal investigation division called The Public Safety Bureau, where designated officers are advised of individuals that have been analyzed and defined as a latent criminal. There job is to implement their investigation and prosecute - or execute - these people in attempts to police a nation and uphold the laws of their technology - the Sibyl System.\nAs Psycho Pass continues to show the Sibyl System juxtaposed\n          \n        against the criminals who are being sought after, you find that the show isn't as black and white as you may initially have thought. In fact, the entire series becomes a large thought experiment as you question the morality of such technology and the detriments this could bring to an otherwise traditional society. These thoughts become even more apparent when they introduce the series' main antagonist, Shogo Makishima, who is dead-set on ending the Sibyl System and returning Japan to a society far before the enhancement of technology. You may find yourself questioning whether or not he is the antagonist anyway, as his dialogue showcases his devotion to the human race.\nThis is where I believe the story is genius. After watching the twenty-two episodes given, I have found myself repeatedly wondering who I was rooting for. It seems as though every character has their own morality that you're keeping track of, constantly questioning whether it resembles your own. As if this wasn't enough to keep my interest, the battles between all of these characters are highly engaging. Most scenes are gritty and involved; ones that are very methodical, going against the very energetic (and sometimes overwhelming) fights that usually take place in shonen anime like Naruto or Fairy Tale.\nThese fights would be nothing without the music, however. The spirit of the music pairs very well with this anime. I was actually really surprised with how much I enjoyed the soundtrack, as I usually remember most of them as uninspired background noise. Psycho Pass has a very unique soundtrack. The highs of the soundtrack are fast-paced and intensity can be felt almost immediately after the track plays. The lows of the soundtrack are distressing and haunting, which seem to flow well with scenes that are meant to be emotional. I think Psycho Pass would have suffered greatly if the current music was not implemented.\nUnfortunately, this anime comes with a few gripes. In particular, the main character Inspector Tsunemori, who is increasingly frustrating as episodes go on. As she is brought on to be an inspector, she is given gruesome experiences with the Sibyl System and her job as an inspector, yet she continues to uphold the utmost respect for it all. The story would hint that her definition of justice was being changed as time went on, but I was waiting for her to express it. To compromise with her thoughts and show her true feelings towards what she had been through, what she had done, and what the Sibyl System was becoming would have made her character much more enjoyable.\nAnother gripe may come from the ending. This wasn't entirely awful, but I was expecting something much more impressive. Without giving anything away, I would describe the ending as anti-climactic. This isn't to say that the ending of the series didn't have meaning; it had plenty of it, including many of the characters transforming into what you might hope them to be as the series moves forward, but the last episode just didn't compare to the adrenaline rush of the episodes before it. Again, not to say that it was disappointing, but rather leaving something to be desired - which may or may not be answered in the next season.\nAll-in-all, Psycho Pass has cemented itself as a staple of science fiction anime. The themes are thought-provoking, engaging, and provocative; which makes for characters that can thrive in an environment that never ceases to amaze. The music pairs smoothly with the animation and seamlessly captivates its audience with an enticing story. This has quickly become one among my favorites list and I believe you'll feel the same way coming out of it. Definitely set some time aside to watch this anime through, I guarantee you'll thank me for it! \n        "},

Well, I'll just add in a little personal experience here and there and spice it up a little to be a bit more interesting.\nPsycho-pass is a phenom of psychological/dystopian anime. It delivers all that it promises in the synopsis and more. The character development, the soundtrack down to the minute detail, the plot progression. It was fantastic....at least the first season was. The second season was a tad of a derailment and many would agree. However, lets continue.\nStory (8/10) The series is set in a dystopian future where a Hue coefficient determines the stability\n          \n        of the average psyche, whether they be mentally stable or no. Think of George Orwell's thought police brought to life; however, instead of hiding in an alcove of the apartment and scribbling in a black book, one follows the view of the enforcer of the thought police for their beloved \"Big Brother,\" the Sybil System. Now, thinking a 1984 cop out would be bad, it actually delivers to the big screen a magnificent performance. Everything from the squabbles with the small-fish to the overall arc in catching the main protagonist: it delivered a Conan Doyle feel of progression \"catching a small fish leading to a bigger fish cliche.\" So, it was an interesting, unrivaled premise in terms of psychological crime. However, the second season tries in its best efforts to match the superiority of the first; and fails absolutely miserably.\nArt (10/10) Holy Hell was the style great. I mean, the futuristic tech looked fantastic and fit the \"peaceful, yet dystopian\" genre. The character sets all have a certain feel: none of them had a distinct anime cut-out. Oh, and the friggin gun, the Dominator! OHHHHHHH! hot damn that thing is crazy when it transforms. You will absolutely love the art style. A crisp, yet \"something hidden under the surface\" feel to the whole platter.\nSound (10/10) Before watching this anime, I recommend turning your subwoofer and sound bar to max bass. The Dominator shot reverberates around the entire room, its freakin incredible the level of bass that is. The scenes all follow up with a fast-paced bgm tempo. The fight scenes have an incredible overlay with an equally fantastic soundtrack. Bottom line: the sound was fantastic. Oh, lets not forget the legendary openings by the one and only Ling Tosite Shigure, the same who did the first Tokyo Ghoul opening! That was enticing, but I believe what stole the show were the endings by Egoist...now those were something quite fitting for the show as a whole for both seasons.\nCharacter (10/10) Again, it is hard to develop a character well in any anime as it takes a lot of screen time, but Psychopass delivers an impactful performance. What do I mean by impactful? All of the characters directly correlate with the plot flow. The mass populus and Akane's friends swayed into the dystopian happiness. The vagrants and pedophiles fed up with their locked away mentality. The Enforcers....each of their personalities all add up to a symbiotic relationship with the story and comes back full circle. However, I will say this. no spoilers. I was very disappointed with the lead's character portrayal in the end....what i mean is, she broke her character bounds and did something completely out of character. It never really made any sense to me nor a lot of fans out there. Nevertheless, bravo performance.\nEnjoyment (8/10) Why so low for an appraised show? I never really was into cop drama. However, I enjoyed the show which was completely beyond my taste and fashion. The show had a fantastic first season, but that was all for me, the first season. The rest of the show had no impact because the lead antagonist was gone. A sort of Moriarity style actor came into play, yet squelched like a flickering candle. Where this is no Moriarity, there is no Holmes. Where there is no Joker, there is no Batman. See where I am getting at?\nOverall (9/10) This would be a 10/10 if it werent for a second season. The extended edition was fantastic, yet the second season sort of killed it for me. Also, what killed it was the out-of-character performance near the end of the first season. It almost took the \"everyone falls under the face of Big Brother\" cliche straight from George Orwell, which frankly pissed me off because of 1. thats been done, and 2. they broke out of character to follow the leads of plagiarism....which is stupid. But overall, a fantastic show which cannot be mentioned enough. If there was an epitome of character development, this show would be the face to portray it along side.\n        "},

This has all of it, in truckloads. Some scenes are stuck with me even now... you will see some fucked up shit and if you decide to quit watching, I wouldn't blame you...

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Overview:\n\"Psycho-Pass\" happens to be the first experience I had with the writing of Gen Urobuchi, otherwise known as the 'Urobutcher'. Infamous for his dark, tragic settings and plot twists or not, you'd have to be a hipster of the highest order to say he doesn't know how to write a good series. Simply put, \"Psycho-Pass\" is a brilliant sci-fi dystopian anime in the same flavour as classics like \"Blade Runner\" and \"Ghost in the Shell\" and is well worth your time.\nStory & World (7/10):\nThe story is set in the year 2113, where Japan is now governed by the Sibyl System. Through hi-tech guns known as\n          \n        Dominators, the state of mind (or Psycho-Pass, hence the title) of an average person is measured in numbers and those that exceed the acceptable limit are deemed threats to society and imprisoned or, in extreme cases, killed. The Public Safety Bureau is the police force in this setting, comprised of Enforcers, people whose Psycho-Pass has exceeded the acceptable level but have been granted permission to go outside to deliver justice, and Inspectors, who supervise the Enforcers and make sure they don't go too far.\nThe story follows Akane Tsunemori, a rookie Inspector who has just joined the police force. Together with the Enforcer, Shinya Kogami, Akane soon uncovers the plot of an exceptionally dangerous criminal, Shogo Makishima (no, it's not a spoiler, he appears in the very first scene) who is plotting something huge and just so happens to have a history with Kogami. It's up to Akane, Kogami and the rest of the Public Safety Bureau to track down this criminal and bring him to justice.\nWhat the story sorely lacks in is surprises. I was almost always able to see exactly what direction things were going to go in, and what were supposed to be big twists I was able to see half an episode before they happened. There were also some truly ridiculous parts as well, such as Kogami being stopped from shooting a criminal with a Psycho-Pass of over 400, despite the fact that everyone is supposed to obey the system regardless. And, ultimately, all this results in is said criminal getting killed in the exact same episode! The concept of the Sibyl System is also underdeveloped, as we never find out exactly how it came to be. All in all, the story just felt very predictable with the really big twists being few and far between and even they weren't all that shocking. That being said, for what it is, the story flows fine and it is easy to understand for all of you sci-fi nerds out there but, personally, I would have preferred a few more things you didn't see coming.\nArt & Animation (9/10):\nVisually, \"Psycho-Pass\" looks nothing short of impressive. The characters models and environments are incredibly well-drawn and the fanservice is kept to a minimum. However, as someone who doesn't mind a bit of fanservice in his anime, I consider what replaces it to be no better, namely the truly gruesome imagery. Basically, if a criminal's Psycho-Pass gets too high, the Dominator changes from paralyser to lethal eliminator, which makes a criminal explode into a gory mess. Because one day, some level-headed genius realised the most humane way to deal with a criminal is to shoot them with a gun that causes their insides to inflate and explode. And I say that with monumentous amounts of sarcasm. Thankfully, these gory scenes are quite rare and, at a certain point, disappear entirely, which myself and my stomach are grateful for.\nSound & Dialogue (10/10):\nWithout a doubt, the series's strongest area. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and to say it fits the series would be an understatement. The series uses two openings and two ending themes and all four of them are fantastic.  There are also plenty of other noteworthy tracks and I recommend looking them up to see for yourself. Some of it can easily be compared to that of \"Deus Ex: Human Revolution\", which, in case you don't know, is a very, VERY good thing. The voice acting is brilliant as well. As with most anime, I watched the dub and it was really good, with Kate Oxely and Robert McCollum delivering brilliant performances as Akane and Kogami, respectively. Complimenting this is a fantastic script with plenty of quotes from a number of great writers and thinkers, including Philip K. Dick. All of this combines to create an experience that is incredibly easy on the ears.\nCharacters (9/10):\nWhat \"Psycho-Pass\" lacks in plot, it makes up for with a strong cast of characters. First, we have Akane Tsunemori, who, despite not being mentioned in the synopsis, is the undisputed main protagonist. While most people view Enforcers as mere 'hunting dogs', Akane believes that to be wrong and instead views them as people. She also disagrees with the flawed nature of the Sibyl System, but eventually learns that, flawed or not, it is still necessary to maintain order. Basically, she serves as the voice of conscience in a highly unforgiving world and while she goes through some huge character development, she never loses that role. Her evolution from naive newcomer to full-fledged badass-but-still-adorable detective meant that by the finale she had become my favourite character. \nNext up is the deuteragonist, Shinya Kogami, who is also an anti-hero. Basically, nothing (not even the Sibyl System) stops him from doing what he believes to be right, and this is part of what made him an Enforcer in the first place. He can come off as quite static, especially when compared to Akane, but that's because he had a hard time in the past and became who he is now, meaning it only makes sense that Akane would change a lot and him not so much. His history and rivalry with main villain Makishima is also very interesting.\nApart from these two, there are several supporting characters, all of whom are well fleshed out and developed, with one unfortunate exception. Akane's superior, Nobuchika Ginoza, deserves a mention. He is the one who views Enforcers as 'hunting dogs', which naturally leads to several arguments between him and Akane. While he comes off as an asshole, he's really just bitter and angry. And boy does he have a good reason to be! \nAnd, of course, who could forget the main villain, Shogo Makishima? Now, the way I see it there are two types of villain- those who are so deluded they believe they're good and those who know they're evil but just don't care. Throughout the whole series, Makishima runs a fine line between both of these. Many of the writer quotes come from him and he comes off as very normal despite being a cold, manipulative sociopath. This makes a truly compelling villain you will absolutely love to hate.\nEnjoyment (8.5/10):\n\"Psycho-Pass\"'s action is absolutely awesome, especially with the main action theme. It's definitely a series you will want to watch through to the end, so long as you can handle it. Unfortunately, there is some horrible stuff in here that may put some people off altogether. After all, they don't call him the 'Urobutcher' for nothing. There are also pacing issues here and there, as the hunt for Makishima can occasionally feel like a drag. Episode 12, which dives into the past, feels particularly disjointed as it only really serves to give Yayoi Kunizuka some much needed screentime and development and doesn't tie in to the overall plot at all.\nOverall:\nRegardless of its predictable story and occasional gratuitously gory deaths, \"Psycho-Pass\" is expertly put together. It will suck you in with its sci-fi dystopian setting, but keep you watching with its action, characters, music and writer references. All in all, a fantastic series that dark sci-fi fans would be crazy to miss. For more on \"Psycho-Pass\", be sure to wait for my review of the second season, which I will be posting within the next few months.\nScore:\n7+9+10+9+8.5=43.5/50=8.7/10\n        "},

The Sibyl System is the name given to a law enforcement enterprise run in cooperation with the government to manage crime in 21st century Japan. It is the sole operator and manager of proprietary hardware and software used to analyze the criminal tendencies of the entire country's populace. The Sibyl System establishes the Public Safety Bureau and rules over its personnel, along with all Psycho-Pass technology and weaponry with an iron\n          \n        fist.\nThe plot is centered around Division 1 of the futuristic police department, mainly Akane - an inspector. In this police force, there are inspectors and enforcers. Inspectors are basically detectives and are intrusted to watch the enforcers, criminals who use their criminal sense to help the police. \nOn the first day of her job, Akane is given a Dominator, a gun like object. The gun is able to determine the identity of its holder, and requires authentication and wireless connection to the Sibyl System in order to operate. Each individual gun can only be heard by the user currently registered to it. When pointed at any human will detect their mental state or rather, psycho-pass. If under 100, the dominator will not activate as they are not a threat to society. Between 100 and 200 the dominator will paralyze them, 200 and 300 would be lethal eliminator, and then 300+ would be destory decomposer. \nThese dominators and sibyl's judgment is what governs this society. However, the real story begins when division one discovers there are some people sibyl can't judge. Some people who, no matter what they do, will never have a crime coefficient over 100. These people include Akane and the seires' antagonist. \nThis story was executed very well and is quite original. I thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nArt: 7\nThe art is done very well but nothing outstanding (in my eyes) so I give it a seven\nSound: 6\nThe soundtrack fits the series, however, its nothing to brag about.\nCharacter: 10\nThe characters are all very deep and are personable. Executed very well overall. \nEnjoyment: 8\nI definetly enjoyed this series and will very soon find myself rewatching it. \n\nOverall: 8\nThis series is great!\nAnd just a random side note - if you enjoyed Death Note, you'd enjoy this. For sure. \nSo anyways,  \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I want to begin this review by saying that I am not the most experienced in reviewing such anime, as this is the first anime I've seen of this genre. However, I will write this based off of how I felt the anime was, so I will leave it to you to decide whether to take heed to my words or not.\nPsycho-Pass is a sort of futuristic mystery anime which focuses on a world set in an Orwellian system where \"big brother\" is always watching. This system is meant to prevent crime as every citizen has a \"crime coefficient\" that rates their likelihood of committing\n          \n        a crime (so it is meant to prevent crime well before it happens). However, crime still seems to be prevalent as the story is of a crime department within the city. That is the basic gist of the story, and I do not want to spoil anything, so I'll just go onto what I enjoyed/disliked about the anime.\nPros: The artwork was gorgeous in my opinion. The dark schemes suited the overall mood of the anime very well. The entirety of the show is of grim crimes, so vibrant scenery would just throw the viewer off. I thoroughly enjoyed the story as there was plenty of character development. I loved the development that we see in the villains as well, including the main antagonist. He is a person that one just cannot hate due to how well he is portrayed. The other minor villains are also not just briefly skimmed past. They are all unique in their own way. The plot of the show is great as well. It is what you would expect from a mystery, but the producers did not neglect to throw in twists.\nCons: The only real \"con\" that I have with this anime is the cliche main character. As you find out within the first episode, he is a sort of rogue cop, which is seen in plenty of other shows and movies. Even though his actions are similar to many other shows and movies, it does not subtract very much from the actual show. Also, the soundtrack was not all too memorable, but this has nothing to do with the actual storyline and show as a whole.\nOverall, I loved this anime. It will definitely be worth a re-watch as it is not too long compared to how long many other animes I have seen are. I am starting the second season with very high hopes because this anime will always be one of the greatest I have ever seen. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good crime drama. Trust me, it's worth it.\n        "},

Even the opening and closing themes are done so terrifically. The sound is great at upholding the mood. The story is unwavering in its drama and excitement. You find yourself getting attached to the characters more and more each episode. Even the antagonists have their own special charm. Each major character is featured with a backstory, all the more reason to accept and admire them. You get to glance into not only the hue of the characters, but understand why it is that color.\nRather than everything being out in the open from\n          \n        the beginning, you slowly learn more and more about their world, keeping you on the edge of your seat. The drama is delivered brilliantly in a well-timed manner with gorgeous art that highlights every moment. The flashy colors along with blood, guts, and gore won't leave your eyes disappointed. \nPsychology and Philosophy also play a big role in this anime. That's something I can't ever get enough of. You'll probably find yourself torn on /whose side/ you're on more than once. If  you're anything like me,  you'll still be asking yourself questions after season 1 is over.\n If you love yourself, you'll give this anime a chance.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Psycho Pass has an incredibly intense plot that starts off seemingly slow but once it takes off it manages to keep going without ever running out of gas. The story of Psycho Pass is not about a band of rebels attempting to destroy the system. It is about people working to protect it in spite of its flaws; because, despite those flaws, the Sibyl System manages to keep the majority of the people relatively happy. Psycho Pass is an interesting take on the freedom vs order argument.\nThe art of psycho pass is amazing. Dark without being noir and sunny without beingl sunshine and butterflies. Psycho\n          \n        pass manages to make a dystopian/utopian world that feels like a real world. Its animation is also great and the combat sequences don't look over exaggerated at all. If you don't like blood, gore, and violence though you should probably stay clear of this show. \nThe soundtrack on this show is awesome. Both opening and ending songs were top tier and suited the show perfectly. I first watched this show as a sub and then rewatched it as dub recently and I felt like the dub voice acting was spot on. The men in this show sound like men and the women don't sound like they sucked in any helium recently. Psycho Pass sounds great.\nThe characters of this show are interesting. Some of the fates and decisions that befall them are predictable while others managed to surprise me. I like all of them and none of them are irritating at all. They all have understandable motivations and even the crazy criminals of this show make sense. I do wish that the side characters had received more attention though.\nKougami Shinya - The primary hero of the show. Kougami is a guy that is willing to do anything and break any rules in order to deal with his obsession. His goal is something that the viewer can make a decision for themselves about the necessity of it without the writers implying it is right or wrong. Its difficult to write anything here without spoilers. I don't particularly like his hair. Too shounen.\nMakishima Shougo - The villain of this story. He is cool because you can see and understand his point of view while at the same time thinking that he is a bastard. \nTsunemori Amane - The rookie protagonist of this show. She is naive at first but definitely comes into her own and develops well as a character. She does sort of get a mental powerup to make her one of the smartest characters in the show but it is nowhere near shounen level in my opinion. My only complaint is a specific episode where I just want to bitch slap her. If you watch it you will understand.\nGinoza Nobuchika - He seems to be a dick at first but he just suffers from a case of 'everybodyleavesmeitis'. His character growth is predictable but interesting nonetheless.\nI really enjoyed this show. Psycho Pass is like Ghost in the Shell if it had been more of a drama with protagonists that seemed more directly involved in the plot. If you like GitS there is a good chance you will like Psycho Pass. I would recommend for anyone that likes shows about society and government.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    ***THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW***\nBefore last week I had almost no knowledge of what Psycho-Pass was or entailed. It was after watching the trailer for the English dubbed version of the movie that I was informed of how good of a series (at least the first season) was so here I am about to lay it out for you.\nStory: 7/10\nThe overarching plot of the anime is quite good and takes some unforeseen twists and turns (in my opinion). It's some of the in-between stuff that prevents me from giving this category more points. There is an episode or two towards the middle of the\n          \n        series (after a HUGE shift of momentum) that seemed pretty unnecessary for moving the plot along (unless they play a large role in season 2 which I have not watched yet). It seemed everything before episode 12 or so had a very important purpose for moving the story along. After said episode though it takes the show a little while to get back on the power for the finale. Also the show actually has bad guys that you kind of feel for. What I mean is that their goals/desires while warped and crude at moments have merit and positives that support their use. The main villain does a great job of offering a counter argument to the status quo even though he takes many lives in the process.\nAnimation: 8/10\nProduction I.G have done a pretty good job here with Psycho-Pass in regards to the animation quality throughout the season's entirety. I watched the show via a blu-ray copy so anything that was present during the running of the show (Fall 2012) was obviously fixed in the blu-ray release. Fights are very detailed, stills look great, and the sense of movement during dialog seems pretty on-cue. Also Akane is super cute even when she get's hardcore.\nSound: 8/10\nI quite liked the overall acoustic performance from the show. The soundtrack seemed spot on and the voice actors hit their marks pretty dang well. I think that the ambient sounds used were also very good. In reality maybe I should rate this higher but there are other shows that do an even better job (Aria, No Game No Life, ext.) but do not let this downgrade your experiences with the show.\nCharacters: 9/10\nI quite like the cast of this show. We are purposely left out of the loop on some of the key backstory information for some of the cast (mainly the enforcers) in order to judge them more on their actions and not their past. The ones that do receive lots of character development (mainly Akane and Shinya) are very interesting to learn about. Shinya's drive is especially cool to see play out. You really sense his inner conflict and why what he does even though it goes against the “sense of law” that governs the world the show takes place in is important. How this also effects Akane's view of the world and “justice” is quite the treat to see. The remaining cast do an excellent job of not only moving the story along but also interjecting their own charm into the character interactions. Also like I stated in the story section, the main villain and his Korean sidekick are kind of relatable and you might side with them more than the main cast.\nOverall: 8/10\nOverall I think the show might deserve more than an 8/10 (see my enjoyment rating bellow) but on a technical level I think it is pretty close. The show is undoubtedly great and if you even remotely like cyber-punk and/or detective type shows then please add this to your watch list. It looks great, sounds great, has super interesting characters, and has a great plot. It might lose some momentum towards the middle but it is only a small roadblock.\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\nSincerely,\nAwesome Drummer\n        "},

Psycho Pass. \nAnime about a future where human mentality has become understandable and readable by machines, people have their jobs assigned to them based on their scanned aptitude, VR progressed so far that social drugs like alcohol and tabacco are a thing of the past since you can get high online.\nBrave New World all over again, this time in anime format. \nExcept it's not, because instead of doing some actual introspection, or at least asking questions that would lead viewers to do some thinking, this anime magnificently adapted itself to the era of social rejects that are too timid to be violent in\n          \n        real life.\nSo, what we get is a grimdark show, containing rape, violence and all other candies for shut-ins to vent their frustration, but still fashioning itself as something seemingly deep.\nAlthough I say that, I admit the show is good, topping in everything except subjective enjoyment, so if you, contrary to me, just want to watch some show that graphically portrays strangling/ vivisecting and then mummifying leftover corpses/ raping and beating a bunch of young women after which a group of weathered, grisly detectives explode that episodes villain into a grotesque mass of blood and rendered flesh while doing their best to stay hard-boiled, then you're in luck.\nThere's no message in there though, I'm afraid.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    NOTE: This is a completely biased anime review. It's my first time too. \nIn the world of Psycho Pass, there are many flaws. To start off is the actual \"Psycho Pass\", the measurement of someone's capacity to commit a crime. Even as the crime itself is being committed right in front of someone, if the Psycho Pass level is not in the red zone according to the Sibyl System, the person committing said act is not an offender. At first, I didn't mind it, until in later episodes. It's just really THAT inhumane, or so the human side of me says so. It pisses me\n          \n        off but that's not a legitimate reason to drop the anime. It's getting good as the episodes go by, after all. The Sibyl System's flaws is the main hindrance for the characters in said anime which intrigues me if they managed to go around it. \nOh, and another thing... their theories are really crazy sometimes. For example would be the Talisman Case and the Spooky Boogie case. Those were some bat-shit-crazy theories but could be possible if they had a blender with the capacity to puree even bones. \nBut, there are a lot of good points in this anime. For one thing would be the plot. There is one antagonist who pulls the strings in all the crimes that were happening and all for some twisted sense of justice (Light Yagami, anyone?) and the people who try and catch him are struggling with the System which they are serving under. I really want to know what happens during their struggles and how they are going to ever catch such a cunning antagonist. \nNext would be the graphics. The animation is smooth, clear and I love the character designs (courtesy of KHR's creator, Amano Akira). Just to point this out, The Dominator is a well designed object. I love the transformation from a Non-Lethal Paralyser to a Lethal Eliminator (IT FREAKING BLOWS UP HALF OF A PERSON!). And, the hologram-based technology. I refer to the second episode where Tsunemori Akane's room transformed into a veery luxurious one. That shit be awesome. And the compact power-like device was very Totally Spies but the design is cute nonetheless that it makes me feel envious. \nOn to the character development. As far as the two main characters go, they are well-developed, especially the main female character, Tsunemori Akane. What most of the female fans (Don't deny it, other female fans) is the romance blooming between the main male character, Kougami Shinya and main female character, Tsunemori Akane. The supporting cast also has their own story to them as to why they have become such people and the creators had done it in a sort-of-slow manner. It was not instant so that's good enough. As for the main antagonist? He deserves to tbe 2013's Best Villian. \nAdmit it, yaoi shippers (shudders). These two (Shinya and Akane) are damn cannon (or is it canon?) and no amount of whining will change that. It hasn't been labeled in Wikipedia (though I've been told its a lie) that it is a romance but it exists nonetheless but it isn't the focal point of the actual anime series so genre labeling really isn't important. \nThe script is very nice too with very good ideas (or rather quotes). An example would be Kougami Shinya's lines in a certain episode and here I quote, \"The weapon is strong so the wielder has to be stronger\". (It's not how it's actually phrased but the idea is there.)\nAs for the music, the first two Opening and Ending sequences (OP being Abnormalize by Ling Toshite Shigure and ED being Namae no nai Kaibutsu by EGOiST) were the most exceptional. In my opinion, I loved the ED more. The lyrics conveys the anime very well, especially in the chorus. The second OP and ED are good too. The OST has been composed by Yugo Kanno. The music is quite fitting for the anime with some having a thrilling feel of impending doom and some with the sci-fi vibes that fit the anime and it's futuristic ways.  \nOverall, I loved this anime and am very willing to have a marathon of it. It may have its flaws but that might be why I'm drawn to it. Flaws may repel or draw people to like the anime but in this case, I'm drawn to it. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    This is my first review, and since I have neither the time nor patience to write in the rambling high school essay-like style that dominate the reviews on this site, I'm going to keep it short and sweet.  I'll skip the background explanation, you can read the synopsis or one of the wall of text reviews for that.  \nFirst off, let me say that this would be a perfect 10 anime if the story wasn't so slow to gain momentum.  I attempted watching this anime on 4 separate occasions only to end up dropping it after the first 2 or 3 episodes\n          \n        because it seemed fairly generic (my initial reaction: \"Effing cyberpunk police? Again?\").  I guess it's the nature of a psychological thriller to start off low-key and then get into the meat of the story, but Psycho Pass took more time to build up than most.  The story really gets going around episode 6 or 7, and once you get over that hump it's an exciting ride.\nOnce the show show finally hits its stride it's deeply engrossing.  What are criminals and what is a crime?  What is social order and what do we sacrifice to have it?  What is justice?  Is a human really human without free will?  And what happens when these concepts are at odds with each other? These provocative themes that question the underpinnings and reality of everyday society are all brought into focus by the main antagonist, who is easily the most interesting character in the story.  Our trusty group of heroes pursue him seeking justice, but become conflicted themselves when faced with the reality that the type of law enforcement that they are used to doling out as a part of their job isn't as fair or infallible as they had believed it to be.  \nSo yeah, if you're a fan of psychological thrillers, do yourself a favor and suffer through the first handful of episodes so you can get to the good stuff and really enjoy Psycho Pass.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    2013 has started off with some wonderful animes. It's only March and I already know that Psycho-Pass is going to be either my #1 or #2 anime for this year. It's thrilling, interesting, well-developed, and oh so enjoyable.\nStory- 9\nThe sci-fi genre doesn't always agree with me. Half are repetitive, executed poorly, confusing, or a combination of the three. Then there are some that have this beautifully unique plot that keep me on edge throughout the entire series. Psycho-Pass was one of these. The story centers around a society that has attempted to reach utopia by handing the law to machines rather than human emotion to\n          \n        judge people's minds based on their psycho pass. But little do they know that their system isn't as perfect as it seems. I, personally, have never watched an anime with an idea like this. The story shows both the side of the Sybil system and the criminal- Makishima. The main character is stuck with a choice between order/stability of the society they already have, or freedom of choice and getting rid of the somewhat corrupt Sybil system. It's controversial. Though the latter is more preferable in theory, getting rid of the present system throws society into chaos. True utopia is never achievable. Both sides are good and bad in their own way, and we get to see Akane struggle through these notions. I enjoyed the psychology behind the anime as well as the great action throughout it. I also liked how even though it's set in the future, certain aspects still remain with certain improvements such as cars, police, and communication. All in all, the story is pretty solid.\nArt- 8\nThe art is what initially put me off. It looked strange and a bit off from my normal, newer anime art. But as soon as I started watching it, I found that the art was really nice and suited the anime very well. Interesting angles are used as well as beautiful scenery shots, especially in the first episode at the end where you get to see a view of the city. The fighting scenes are well animated, the dominators are well animated, most everything is well animated. My only complaint is the animation quality drop towards the middle end of the series. You can definitely tell there was a budget cut or someone was getting lazy in that 1 or 2 episodes. If you need proof, just look at Ginoza's face when he's taking off his glasses. Other than that, the art is nice.\nSound- 10\nI have no complaints about sound what-so-ever. I instantly fell in love with the first OP, Abnormalize, and the amazing opening credits it came with. That OP has to be one of my top favorites of all time especially because it suits the anime and the credits so well. All of the music does. All of the OP's and ED's are memorable. The action music, psychological music, the creepy sounds of bodies or flesh, even the un-suiting classical music in the last ep with Makishima suited and enhanced the anime so much. I liked all the voice actors, found that their voices suited the characters, and was surprised to find just how amazing seiyuu's can be to be able to change their voices to the extent they can. (seriously, just look at other roles Kougami's and Makashima's voice actors have done!) Job well done.\nCharacter- 8\nI thought about giving character a 9, but realized that some of the characters lacked a little in character development. All of the characters have distinctive personalities. I was annoyed with Akane in the first ep but grew to love her as I watched her grow into a full-fledged bad-ass Inspector. I fell in love with Ginoza too because of his character development and his past. With characters like Akane and Kougami, we see a lot of character development and insight into their minds because they're the main characters. Even though Makishima is the main villain, we aren't given much insight into his past or what makes him him besides some of Kougami's speculations. With a unique personality like Makishima's, I would have felt more comfortable if we were given a flashback into his childhood or something like with Yayoi. Fortunately, we were presented with various thoughts of his and got to see through his mind in some aspects, making his lack of background nearly unnoticeable. Other minor characters such as Kagari and Shion hinted on pivotal moments in their life that made them enforcers, but didn't give more than a sentence or two to speculate on. Maybe it was on purpose to leave it open to the viewers, but I would've liked at least a good 5 minutes or episode (like Yayoi's) on them to really grip why they are who they are.\nEnjoyment-10\nI really loved this whole series, especially the end. It made me cry, it made me think, it made me squeal in excitement. I was on edge the entire time and awaited each new episode eagerly.\nOverall-9\nEven though I fully enjoyed and personally ranked Psycho-Pass as a 10, as a review I have to overall rank it as a very high 9 because of the issue with art in the middle and lack of stories for Makishima and some minor characters. It's not perfect, but it's a damn good anime and I highly suggest it to anyone who enjoys a little serious thinking with their anime.\n        "},

It'll make you consider things you've most not likely even thought of before, it might even make you think \"what if.\" I know that I did. Hell, I even sat debating what my psycho-pass would be like, what my score would be. The thought of the future being controlled by a \"computer system\" was scary enough, let alone the main villain.

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    In a word: underwhelming.\nReading the many positive reviews for this show, and having had it recommended to me by two people, I was excited to start this show, but unfortunately it did not deliver. I had read a few times that Psycho-Pass was like a spiritual successor to Death Note, however, with its less-than-stunning characters and slapdash plot, it felt more like a fanfic that tried (and failed) to capture the dark ethical themes in Death Note. Not only is the philosophy half-baked, but - with the exception of Akane - it is also difficult to discern what ethical or moral system the characters are\n          \n        operating out of. \nStory - 6: An interesting concept is more or less squandered by mediocre writing and poor story-telling. The first half of the story seems to focus around the characterization of the main villain. However this characterization and build-up has practically no other purpose other than foundation for the villain. In addition, the villain is a very flat character, with the only traits being bloodlust and intellect. There are many unfounded plot jumps, ranging from small hops to downright leaps of faith, causing a disruption in the suspended belief that we are supposed to hold as viewers. The quality of writing is directly linked to the quality of characters and character development (which is also pretty shoddy). The first half of the series seems to have no bearing whatsoever on the wider plot of the series. The plot developments for the most part seem forced and rely too much on the psychology of the characters - characters that all suffer from extreme mediocrity. Despite all this, it does somehow maintain a thread of intrigue and tension that keeps viewership somewhat bearable\nArt - 7: The art is good, though it's nothing really special. Some of the 3D effects are really good, but some are really unnecessary. \nSound - 8: Probably the strong suit of the whole series, Psycho-Pass sports a very good OST in addition to classical songs such as \"Ode to Joy\" and \"La Fille au Cheveux de Lin\". Though I have heard better soundtracks.\nCharacters - 5: Another weak point for Psycho-Pass, the characters in this show are mostly flat and static. The only character who shown even a semblance of development is Akane, though her development falls short of anything I would expect. We don't get the backstory on any of the characters, only hints, which by itself is not bad. However, some of the characters rest of the actions or stories of their past. Not addressing their pasts, I believe, was a big mistake. But perhaps the weakest part of the characters is the lack of their own thoughts and feelings. We don't need to literally hear their thoughts, but without any asides or personal moments, the characters fall flat and become shadows of what they could be. \nEnjoyment - 6: Definitely not the worst show I've seen but it is a far cry from anything I consider \"great\".\nOverall - 6\nExtra ratings:\nGore: 6.5 - definitely some gory stuff but nothing really over the top\nSadness: 2 - not a sad show at all\nFeel Good™: 2 - not a show that gives you the warm fuzzies \nAddictivity: 4 - really easy to pace if necessary \nMisogyny: 1 - probably the show the least amount of misogyny I've ever seen, anime or live action.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    Summary:\nThe series take place in a dystopian future, where people's state of mind can be easily measured. Psycho-pass is basically a number which represents the person's state of mind and his/her likelihood of committing a crime. If this number gets high your psycho-pass turns into a darker and darker colour and if you exceed certain numbers, you got confined in a rehabilitation center or worse, shot to death immediately. So even if you commit no crime, you can still be punished for thinking about committing a crime because it makes your psycho-pass got clouded.\nBut not all people, who harbours criminal thoughts with clouded psycho-pass, got\n          \n        confined or killed. Some of them become a police unit called Enforcers and help inspectors, who are normal police with clean psycho-pass. The story is centered around an inspector, Tsunemori Akane, the new inspector of the Unit One.\nStory (9/10):\nAlthough the main theme may not look very original (I mean a dystopian government and some revolutionarists fighting each other), the story is indeed a unique one. First ten episodes, or something like that, are about small incidents which always connect to our main antagonist, Makishima Shougo. Even before the main antagonist's show up, the episodes are really enjoyable. You are getting curious about what will happen next and what will happen to the villain. But what makes this series perfect is the main antagonist, Makishima Shougo and his efforts to crush the system which doesn't value the ideas and will of the individuals.\nOf course, this series is not something like George Orwell's 1984 or Animal Farm. It mixes the elements of action and thrill with the actual message about the importance of individual's thoughts or If I borrow Makishima's words, the importance of \"humans to live as humans again\". \nCharacters (8/10):\nAlthough Tsunemori Akane is the protagonist, she is too inexperienced and indecisive which makes her pretty forgettable between the characters like Makishima and Kougami. And no one other than Kogami stands out in the Unit One, as I have said before this includes Akane herself. Kagari and the other girl (I forgot her name) in the team basically do nothing other than running around during the series. Makishima Shougo however is great. Let me explain why. Unlike the most of the shounen animes/mangas, Makishima doesn't possess a supernatural power or ability (he has only one if you count his psycho-pass' inability to get clouded). He doesn't have a great wealth or an army to fight against the government either. He only has his intelligence and his ideas. He makes allies by either manipulating them or sharing his ideals with them. He strikes the system with carefully constructed plans. It was great to watch someone with no superpower standing against the totalitarian system with his schemes  and ideas only. \nIt would be great if there were more capable characters who have some depth into them. If there had been, I would have given no less than 9/10.\nArt (8/10):\nArt is good, but not very exceptional in this times.\nSound (8/10):\nNot bad, but not that great either. There were few soundtracks I have listened to again and again. Opening and ending was good. The ending, Namae no nai kaibutsu, is a song of the famous group EGOIST. \nOverall (9/10):\nI definitely recommend Psycho-Pass to anyone. There were some things that could be done better. Some characters could take more scenes in anime. But it is a great show regardless.\nAnd I really liked that they showed us the books Makishima reads and quotes from during the series. I remember \"The Revolution Betrayed\" or \"A Heart of Darkness\" but there were many more.\nI give a 9/10 to Psycho Pass and end my review with a quote from Makishima:\n\"I want to see the splendor of people’s souls. I want to check and see if it really is precious. However, when humans base their lives around Sybil’s Oracle, without ever consulting their own wills, do they really hold any value?\"\n"},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    Psycho Pass is probably what I get for going into something with high expectations. Not to say it doesn’t set itself up for them; much like Tokyo Ghoul, the first episode of Psycho Pass is interesting, gripping, and intelligent. Its high octane sci-fi dystopia, aided by a little gore and thriller, smattered with moral debate. But again like Tokyo Ghoul, its first episode sets the expectations somewhere where I was left waiting much of the rest of the season for it to go back to the same amount of excitement, where instead, Psycho Pass fills out its 22 episode length with many episodes of exposition\n          \n        and, yes, I dare call them filler content at times. Not that I'm here to say that exposition or filler is uncalled for, as I can’t expect there to be gross severed limbs every episode (though its been done before, Attack on Titan). Many even would call the many episodes build up to the real conflict a perk of Psycho Pass, allowing the dystopia of Psycho Pass to be truly fleshed out and realized. This I dont necessarily disagree with, but at the same time, the pay out and world building all falls lack luster by the finale.\nTo be quick, Psycho Pass is about a dystopian future where an ever present computerized Sybil System that rules over and judges every person through an analysis of their personality, up to the point of being able to predict a person’s criminal intent before they commit any crimes. As such, the story follows up and coming Inspector Tsunemori from her first day on the job of overseeing Enforcers, people dubbed latent criminals by the Sybil System that do the dirty work of Inspectors in exchange for what measly rights they can still have as (possible) criminals. This work includes shooting (sometimes to kill) those deemed a danger to society with the Dominators, specialized weaponry that comes imbedded with the Sybil System to judge anyone literally within its sights. If the Sybil System does not find the person dangerous, the gun will not shoot. Two minute crash course finished.\nTo start with, the characters: to be blunt, all of them are good, but only three are worth taking note of. I really liked Ginoza and the older detective, as well as the supporting cast of Makishima's gang, but that does not exactly make them compelling. A good note though is that each character at least does serve as a point of perspective on how the world around them may be viewed, such as Ginoza being the kind of person to distance themselves from the Enforcers as if they are diseased. In all honesty, many characters could comfortably fit under a morality scale: newbie Tsunemori is the Lawful Good, refusing to act out of the line of the law, hardened Enforcer Kogami is Neutral Good, wanting there to be change obviously but not having a way to get to it, and antagonist Makishima as the Chaotic Good, attempting to change society through heinous acts of crime. Thus the entire basis of Psycho Pass is the interactions of these three characters, and this aspect of the show is capitalized brilliantly.  \nWhat is not so brilliantly done is a comfortable slide of character development. Instead, Kogami does what we always assumed he would end up doing, Makishima continued his rampage until the bitter end, and Tsunemori... while I cannot say that she did not change at all, her development was an abrupt one. While there is one certain segment that I was honestly in question as to what choice she would make, ultimately said decisions did not change her character. It’s more like one second she’s naïve and innocent and the next she’s all ‘Let’s think like Kogami now’, but not beyond his field work. She simply becomes smarter by the end of the series, but not necessarily changed in temperament (if anything she’s just more … jaded I’d say), and neither does Kogami, nor does Makishima. And the Sybil System knows this upon its enlisting Tsunemori! Through no major plot revelations, it’s easy to deduce that the Sybil System is abusing Tsunemori’s good will in order to further its own ends (and itself), which sort of waves a big flag marked PREDICTABLE on Tsunemori’s huge forehead. \nThen there’s my issue with the shows premise: Psycho Pass is biased. It’s sort of like Fox News reporting on murder: It wants us to believe its giving a ‘Fair and balanced’ stance, while at the same time totally blowing issues out of proportion. Psycho Pass the show chooses to give us the darkest side of the Sybil System, and then let us form our opinions on it. Providing a defense of the Sybil System would actually require a more detailed analysis into the inner workings of the show, while providing an argument against it would literally take a single viewing. Psycho Pass obviously wants us to not like the Sybil System, right? It’s a show about speculation and forming our own thoughts, and yet it requires us to think in the way it wants us too. Take, for example, that besides running Psycho Passes, the Sybil System also provided for job aptitude. And the food supply. And education. And it just so happens that its really good at providing for their legal system too. Its actually almost exactly like cable television, because when we are reported to on homicides practically every night, we think crime around us is way up, and then we get worried. In actuality, crime has been steadily dropping for years now. In Psycho Pass, since we see many instances of high criminal activity involved in the society, we tend to believe its running rampant. In the true world of Psycho Pass though, most people tend to come off as content and happy outside of the police department. Many are well fed and educated and they have a system in which few are left to have to commit to labor intensive jobs such as *cough cough* harvesting, and thus it can be implied there is a higher job satisfaction rate as well. And the implications of how low crime is due to the small size of their departments. No huge S.W.A.T. teams are ever seen, are there? But see there, I have to use the word implied. Because much of this is not out rightly stated but instead subtle, background noise to Psycho Pass’s own big reveal of how corrupt the world and the Sybil System is.\nFinally, something that always bothered me was how Makishima attempts to fight the Sybil System even after finding out its true form. Or how the Sybil System is viewed as a machine, again, after its true form is revealed. I mean, the Sybil System itself is not an evil being, nor do the acts it commits come across as evil, except for one certain death threat that was honestly meant to protect itself. Makishima, on the other hand, could easily be considered evil, even though he is equally apathetic as the Sybil System, but for different reasons. Makishima is not really attempting to become a martyr for the human race; no, instead, he’s just trying to prove that he is better than everyone else, including the System. Because really, if the guy is apathetic, then he would be towards all the things except himself, since he is himself and has to at least sustain himself. Thus his ends are to make his only possible connection, himself, better, and existing better. If he truly cared about the human cause, would he viciously murder them and set them up for failure. No, in the end, he’s literally just trying to prove how right he is, and he wins that in the end by having to have the strongest force on the job track him to wits end in order to take him down. \nOn the other hand, the Sybil System works in order to better itself so that it can better humanity, the exact opposite of Makishima. Yet it needs Makishima in order to get better. Isn’t it just a fun game of round Robin we have here? Still, the Sybil System doesn’t actually pose a threat to the humans because it is not meant to pose a threat to humans because *MAJOR SPOILER THAT I CANT TRULY AVOID* it is humans. A bunch of them, put together, made to aid the human race. Sure, its stupidly cliché, the whole brains in a jar deal, but whatever. Ill bypass that in order to prove that the Sybil System is NOT %100 machine and thus cannot be brushed off as just a machine doing the work of humans. *MAJOR SPOILERS END* The Sybil System isn’t perfect. If that were the case, Enforceres would just all be robots made with Dominators, right? But that isn’t the case. The Sybil System is not perfect, and they were not meant to take it as such. Unfortunately, the lesser humans took it too far and began to rely on the Sybil System in an unhealthy manner, while it, on the other hand, made itself stronger. THAT is what is the true issue here, NOT whether or not Makishima is truly evil, because really, he changed oh so very little about the system. Seriously what was his issue? He was living so comfortably, very luxurious obviously. He was just bored I suppose. That doesn’t make him a hero though.\nWhile Im not looking to spoiler the ending, I do address that it was, if anything, anti-climatic. Not because it was uncalled for, but because it was 100% called for, and probably exactly what the viewers wanted, which in this case, isn't the best option when there was so much more development and possibilities open to having some real change come along instead of a more cliche finale. And I can prove that very little changed in the end, because the ending sequence was  frame by frame, on purpose, the exact same as the opening sequence,  just with Tsunemori in the lead role now. From a production stand-point I’m sure this comes off as the cool way to end it, but thematically, it signals to the audience that really, very little has actually been affected in the near 8 hours you’ve put into the show by now, besides role swaps. Sure sure, it was COOL that they did that. But was it necessary? I wanted them to having to fight the Sybil System, or society, but in the end it became a masculinity brawl between the two main killers of the show, which, true, is how it started as well (the Tsuemori narrated prologue clip), but see there again it is. Psycho Pass did not change. It set its pretty stage, and then had two men duel to the death instead of, say, Tsunemori avenging Kogami. Or something?\nThat’s my take on Psycho Pass. I’m attempting to keep these things shorter, so Im wrapping it up soon. If you try to type in ‘Sybil System good?’, very little shows up to back up any statements regarding that. There is a point to be made in that, and in the entire world of Psycho Pass. That’s what makes it actually a very good show though: it is one that can be heavily debated and delved into and discussed, something that is a sign of a good set up. Unfortunately, I just don’t think there is enough material in the first season to truly judge the full picture correctly. It’s a great ride, which is why I still can’t rate it lower than a six. The fact that I had to go into such a moral debate makes me happy instead of just a ripping apart of thematic and situational ironies (though seriously, Makishima’s ability is never truly explained. Major plot hole). Indeed, I’m not saying the Sybil System is perfect, but it’s really not fair to judge it with the information, or lack thereof. If the producers really wanted to pose a moral question, the positive aspects of the Sybil System would have to be brought to light too, something that I didn’t see happen here. Looking at it that way, Psycho Pass can only be regarded as an entertaining thriller instead of a highly psychological head-twister."},

People have always detested evil and sought out a righteous way of living. Their feelings – the accumulation of those peoples feelings – are the law.\" - Tsunemori Akane, Psycho-Pass\nYou may or may not agree with me on this review. This review will contain general comments so as to not spoil the anime for those who have not watched it. \nStory: 8/10\nPsycho-Pass has a good storyline. The dystopian world of Psycho-Pass captivates the viewer and brings them into their world. Although the first few episodes was not very relevant to the plot, the real action comes\n          \n        in when the villain, Makishima Shogo, is introduced. The following arcs are full of action and fit together seamlessly. \nOne strong point of the story would be the dialogue and quotes, there are many thought-provoking quotes in Psycho-Pass. The dialogue is strong and makes you empathise with the characters. \nAlthough the anime ends well, there are still quite a number of questions that have not been answered. \n\nArt: 8/10\nThe art is average but the animation of Psycho-Pass is fluid and consists mainly of dark tones, which sets the mood of the anime. What I like about the art would be the animation for the openings, which are full of vivid imagery and foreshadowing. Now that is how you tell a story with animation. \n\nSound: 9/10\nThe sound is amazing! I liked the openings and endings, Ling Tosite Sigure and EGOIST did a great job with the openings and endings which fit the atmosphere of the anime. However, there were a few background tracks that did not fit. \nNow, moving on to voice acting. The voice actors did an excellent job of bringing their characters out and fleshing their personalities. Kudos to Sakurai Takahiro (Makishima Shogo), Seki Tomokazu (Kougami Shinya) and Hanazawa Kana (Tsunemori Akane) for bringing the characters to life and making me empathise with them through their voices. \n\nCharacter: 9/10\nThe Psycho-Pass cast are generally likeable and unforgettable. The number of characters are enough not to make the story way to confusing. \nMost people would probably scoff at Tsunemori Akane's character but I disagree. I think Akane is a great heroine of the story. Sure, she may be a crybaby at the start but at least she is realistic. Akane gets great character development and matures to become a brave and badass character at the end. But I think Akane's character development could have been done better if her development was spaced out. \nNext, Makishima Shogo. Makishima is an intelligent character and an interesting villain. However, one flaw with Makishima would be the fact that he is somewhat a Gary-Stu. How does he defeat Kougami Shinya in a fight, when Kogami has been practising for a long time? Despite that, he is a likeable villain. Although he is the antagonist of the anime, somehow I wanted to root for him and hoped that the Sibyl System could be abolished. Another flaw with Makishima would be the lack of back-story, which is a pity for a character who had so much potential. \nThe other characters of Psycho-Pass also have their own character development. Psycho-Pass not only focuses on Akane and Kougami but also shines the spotlight on the other members of Divison 1. The supporting cast are definitely not just one-dimensional characters and I totally empathised with them while watching. \n\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nPsycho-Pass is one of the best Sci-Fi anime that I've watched so far. It was certainly one hell of an entertaining ride and full of emotions! I would definitely rewatch Psycho-Pass. \nStrengths: Good storyline, thought-provoking dialogue, interesting characters. fluid animation, no one-dimensional characters, full of angst\nWeakenesses: A few plot holes, irrelevant first few episodes, somewhat Gary-Stu villain \nOverall: 9/10\nThis show gets a score of 9 (rounded up from 8.8) or an A minus. However, Psycho-Pass is definitely not for the faint-hearted. There will be bloody and disturbing scenes, so I would recommend Psycho-Pass to audiences at least 16 years of age. It is full of angst and if you're into shoujo or hoping for fluffy romance scenes, I would not recommend you to watch this as not to get your hopes to high up. \n\nDo hit the 'I found this review helpful' button if you enjoyed my review!

I say that as a good thing. Normal Tv shows can learn a few things from Psycho-Pass. To put it simply I really want another season of Psycho-Pass, but if they don't make another season I'm ok with that, the last episode still gives me enough closure so I don't go crazy wanting to know what happens next. \nThe second thing I have to say is, watch this anime. If you like a great story, with some of the best characters I've seen\n          \n        in any movie or Tv show (anime or otherwise), that is visually very amazing, that has some really awesome action moments, then watch this anime. \n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Psycho-Pass was an absolute thrill to watch with its excellent combination of a intricate plot and ever-developing characters that were all set in a very thought-provoking dystopian future Japan. This show grabbed me instantly and wouldn't let go. The over-arching plot is just superb with plenty of twists, shocking moments, varying sets/situations and even a few feels along the way. The use of criminal-coefficients and the Sibyl system along with the themes that they invoked have been done before but I thought that P-P put a very cool and unique spin on it. This wasn't just an \"evil\" big brother system that was controlling every\n          \n        one in a totalitarian manner. There were very clear benefits to this so-called \"perfect\" system and this is where a lot of the show's conflicts arise.\nThe characters are also where the show truly excelled. Kougami was a badass MC with a very clear motivation for \"justice\" but was constantly walking the tightrope between what was right and vigilantism. I initially thought that the female MC, Akane, was a bit weak but I was definitely proven wrong. Her development from a naive and gullible newbie to a true and intuitive detective struggling with the ideals and purpose of the Sibyl was handled excellently. It was very believable and followed along with my same feelings about the world of P-P. The other supporting characters were very strong as well especially Masaoka. And, last but not least, was the villain Makishima. He was truly one of the best villains that I've seen in a while with his brilliant schemes, awesome dialogue (so many quotes from brilliant authors from Shakespeare to recent philosophers), and his very distinct motivations. You could really sympathize and understand what he was trying to accomplish yet at the same time, despised/loved him at the same time.\nWatch this show ASAP. This is one psychological thriller that you shouldn't miss. You won't be disappointed. I can't wait for the movie and the second season to come out.\n9/10\n        "},

It's villains are all memorable in their own way, and even though Shogo leads the pack he does not overshadow any of the others. Character-wise Akane Tsunemori is one of the best female characters I've seen in an anime in a while. Rather than take the easy way out,  Urobuchi crafted a truly original character. Her interactions with Kogami are one of the best parts of the already stellar plot.

The models are intricately detailed, and the special effects when they are shot are equal parts satisfying and horrifying (exactly as they should be)\nThe audio direction is amazing, not much to say other than that. \nOverall, an extremely enjoyable cyberpunk series and the kind of anime that comes only once every few years.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    PSYCHO-PASS: Incredible potential, but not executed perfectly\nI have to admit that I only watched Psycho-Pass because it has been written by Gen Urobuchi, and because people have been saying that it is the new Ghost in the Shell. Well, I’m not disappointed.\nThe first half of Psycho-Pass has a writing style that is somewhat episodic. Tsunemori Akane, together with major and supporting characters, just go around and do detective work, like solving mysterious crimes and being in the action firsthand. What I really like about this almost-episodic half is that it has been effective in establishing the world of Psycho-Pass. What I don’t like about it\n          \n        is that the building up of the mini story arcs is very well done but their climaxes and conclusions tend to fall short. The only thing to blame here is the writing.\nBut the redeeming factor of this half is the revelation that there is a mastermind behind these seemingly random crimes that they’re solving. It just means that the story is actually not episodic to a full extent. It gives the viewers a singular, overall story.\nThe second half of Psycho-Pass is what really carries the series to a different level. This is where it becomes apparent that it has been written by Gen Urobuchi. The decision-making of the characters that could influence the overall story is present, like much of Gen Urobuchi’s works. And also like his other works, this half is also dialogue-heavy and has minimal action, but still sustains the immediate sense of danger and conflict.\nBut this half is not perfect. Like the first half, there are tendencies where the building tension is effectively made but the climaxes fail to deliver. However, when looking at the second half overall, it is very intense. And one of the primary factors that make it so is the story’s ability to emotionally incorporate the characters to the plot.\nSpeaking of the characters, most of them are actually very well-made. All of the Inspectors and the Enforcers have something going on inside their head. How they have been interwoven to the original story gives the viewers emotional investment towards them. I also like the fact that they have contradicting personalities, which is actually a common feature in Gen Urobuchi’s character-writing. This feature adds conflict between the characters, and that is always interesting, especially when two clashing ideologies are either correct.\nBut the thing I like best about the characters is how they have developed all throughout the series. All of them have significant changes by the end of the series. And if a writer has been able to pull that off, while stitching that to the overall plot, you know that he’s doing a fine job. Psycho-Pass is basically both character-driven and plot-driven.\nThe music and animation is not very good however. The music, even though there are tracks that effectively convey emotions, is not groundbreaking -- just enough to deliver. The animation is the same case.\nEven though Psycho-Pass could have been better if it has had top of the line music and animation, it is not a major flaw. It is a series that doesn’t rely on either. Its juice is in the story and the characters.\nOverall, Psycho-Pass is an above average anime, and the real factor that makes it less than amazing is, as I said earlier, the writing having the tendency to fluctuate in quality. If it has been able to improve its writing, perhaps it could have been the next Ghost in the Shell like the others say, or, speaking more safely, its influence could have been much more impactful. I admit, however, that I’m still a fan of Gen Urobuchi’s writing, and I’m looking forward to the next season."},

How do you judge them without being prejudiced? Would you trade freedom for safety? And the last question: How many animes even raise such questions?\nMorality, law enforcement, judicial system, modern society, advanced technologies, over-secure standarts, the human soul as well as mind and even more themes are touched by this gem from Gen Urobuchi.\nThis dark themed police sci-fi thriller is filled with original cases and a story that leaves you questioning a system that has the chance to become either a utopia\n          \n        or dystopia, a gift or a curse, depending on your own personal views on society and moral values.\nThe art style has nice a comic vibe to it and reminds me of old classics like Cowboy Bebop, while animation and CG work (with some drops in quality here and there) is constantly fluid and effective. Music and sound fit the grim sci-fi setting perfectly and strenghen the thrilling scenes, wether it´s a dialogue full of quotes from classic literature or the pursuit of a criminal.  Voice work is excellent and keeps on adding to the whole atmosphere of this anime.\nSome characters don´t get as much character development as they would deserve, but the main protagonists and more than anything the main antagonist make more than up for it.\nThe relationship and connections between the good and the bad guy really are a feast to watch and even without seeing the last two episodes, I can already heartily recommend this to anyone who wants to see an adult and intelligent cop-thriller, with a villain that reminds one of the excellent adaption of the Joker in the Dark Knight movie.  \nIn the flood of school boys being heroes, having a harem or seeing a big boobed girl being clumsy this is one diamond you shouldn´t pass on and a must see for those who enjoyed Cowboy Bebop and similiar animes.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I have been putting off writing this review for a few days after finishing Psycho-Pass, as, after all, it was such a masterpiece and I'd like to do it justice...\nStory - 10/10.\nWhat else could I give this than a 10? It's probably the most intelligent anime out there (or certainly one of them). Psycho-Pass is set in a dystopian future where society is governed by what is assumed to be an artificial intelligence - the Sybil System. Our protagonist, Akane Tsunemori, is a new Inspector and the story revolves around her life and struggles as an Inspector, but at the same time it's so much\n          \n        more - it doesn't follow just one story. Instead of focusing too intently on one character or small group of characters, it was told from a variety of perspectives. Within this anime issues such as right and wrong are dealt with, and also issues such as the fact that people are governed by an AI, and the AI's judgement is absolute law - if their hue on their psycho-pass becomes clouded and their crime coefficient is raised above a certain level, the Inspectors and Enforcers then pursue them and apprehend them. There are very dark themes within this anime, murder and torture are pretty prevalent throughout, but it is not dealt with in a tasteless manner. The story telling was so good that I was moved to tears on several occasions, and I got incredibly involved in the story and characters. Information about the world the characters live in was revealed consistently - no episode was an info-dump, the amount of dialogue and action was nicely balanced.\nArt - 10/10.\nThe art for this anime was also splendid - although it is not your usual 'anime' style, that adds to the realism of the story and increases its impact. The relatively neutral colour palette added to the dark and gloomy atmosphere created in this anime, and the gore etc wasn't too much - just the right amount to be shocking without being tasteless. I enjoyed the character designs - as previously stated it steers right away from a classic \"anime\" style, instead opting for more realism. The lack of \"moe\" was really refreshing. I know there's a little controversy surrounding Akane's design as some really disliked it, but I think she was cute! And it helped us to be interested in her as a deeper character rather than being interested in how she looks.\nSound - 10/10.\nThe OPs and EDs for Psycho-Pass were fitting. The OPs set us up for really intense and dramatic episodes, and the EDs were a nice wind-down after each episode finished. I thought the character voices were superb also - each one fit with their character and none of them seemed out of place. Each seiyuu gave a believable and emotional performance which, again, really added to the realism. Also worth a mention is the background noise - orchestral music set scenes very well and added to the atmosphere of the show.\nCharacter - 10/10.\nThe cast of characters in Psycho-Pass is just phenomenal. Each character grows in their own way throughout the series, and each is a fleshed-out unique individual. What particularly impressed me was Akane's character development - she starts her work as an innocent, enthusiastic, naive and idealistic character, and throughout the series she learns more and more and by the end of the series it is clear how much she has changed. Another facet I particularly enjoyed was the back-story we got about each character - it was always gripping to watch their previous struggles and learn about their pasts, and it gave each character realistic depth and explained their actions and interactions.\nEnjoyment - 10/10.\nI was entirely gripped whilst watching this series. I HAD to know what happened next episode when one finished. Each part of this anime was masterful, and it raised some serious questions. Such as who is right or who is wrong? Especially when the main antagonist Makishima is introduced, this issue becomes all the stronger, and the lines between the two more blurred.\nI would recommend this anime to anyone who wants a change from the usual 'moe', 'slice of life', harem, romance, etc anime, anyone who loves action, or anyone who wants a really intense intelligent anime to watch.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    Alright, here I go...\nI'll be honest here, starting from episode one I had a feeling that I would not like this series... people can go on and on about how good it is, but to me that's nothing but a lie.\nThe idea of the Psycho-Pass and such was interesting. Checking the mentality of a person and finding a compatible lifestyle and career all controlled by what is called the Sibyl system, which turns out to be more messed up than we originally thought.\nWhat isn't interesting is the cliche character and the cliche story we have to follow instead.\nMain female character in a situation where she\n          \n        is new to her job, wanting to prove herself but lacks confidence and doesn't think she is fit for her job.\nMain male character is a talented ex cop kind of guy who seeks revenge and does his job in a cool and cold manner.\nBad guy is a someone that thinks the system is a mistake and sees the lives of people as nothing but a game, so using his superior intelligence, he controls the people around him.\nThe story is basically about strange crimes happening all around the city that we follow episode by episode only to realize all the crimes are actually connected by one mastermind. WHOA, HOW ORIGINAL!!!!! NO OTHER POLICE SERIES HAS EVER USED SUCH A PLOT BEFORE!!! I hope you can feel the sarcasm in that cap sentence. It isn't later until we are told exactly what the Sibyl system is but that hardly matters in the series, in fact we have to leave that juicy bit alone and just continue to watch the bad guy and the good guy play tag.\nMajority of the series I felt like the female character was in the way, sure she had character growth but exactly what has she done right in this series? She hasn't done much at all, majority of the time she was merely a noisy bystander that was helpless and couldn't anything to change a situation. She makes rational and reasonable decisions but what fun is that? Why would we want to watch through the eyes of something just \"reasonable\" when it's far more interesting to watch through the eyes of someone passionate about their goals and their term of justice? So we could make the decision of what is right or wrong ourselves? Is that the psychological aspect of this series? If that's the case, I think they completely missed on the true potential of what Psycho-Pass could have been.\nIf the series was more focused on the Sibyl System and changing the way it controls society and giving characters more of a voice, then I think the series would have had more impact. Instead, like I said, we have to ignore all that and just watch the bad guy and good guy fight things out, but when you already see the bigger picture, their battle hardly seems to matter. \nEnough of that... moving onto the art...\nThe character design was done by the mangaka of Reborn! and I do not like the way she draws girls, she draws beautiful men but girls are just not her thing, I really hate how stuck up their noses are and how they literally right in between the eyes. Other than wanting to rearrange the main female characters face, I had no other problems with it...  unless you count the fact that she's recycled her old art to make these designs.\nBackground and such were well done, the animation itself was not at all sloppy and they did a great job.\nSound was good, nothing more to say...\nOverall, I thought this series was mediocre... it had great potential but in the end it was just a let out. In fact a lot of it reminded me of Sherlock Holmes, and I can't say that's a good thing because just copying something great isn't enough. I don't really recommend this series, but a lot of people seem to enjoy the cheap thrill of it, so hell, if you aren't into a good quality series then go ahead and watch it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Psycho-Pass: You're Psychotic If You Pass This Up\nI won't lie when I say Psycho-Pass was a series that restored my faith in anime. 2012 was a rather lackluster year for great anime. However, there was one series that caught my attention in the fall season and that was this series. It's the latest installment in Gen Urobuchi's fantastic stretch of great anime scripts and composition. Considering his prior works include Fate/Zero, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, and Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom, Psycho-Pass certainly did not disappoint.\nThe plot and story of Psycho-Pass is quite similar to that of the works of Phillip K. Dick, probably most\n          \n        comparable to Minority Report. The plot takes place in Japan in the far future. Japan has become a dystopian society that is regulated by automated enforcement, notably known as the Sibyl System. This system uses a scoring and color coding system of measuring a person's psyche and calculates their probability of committing a crime. This score is known as a Psycho-Pass and the higher ones Psycho-Pass score becomes, the darker their hue becomes, the more severe the system punishes them. It's a system based more on crime prevention than enforcement. Despite humanity being judged by the Sibyl System, it still requires a police force to regulate the system and carry out its justice. That is the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division. The story follows a young woman named Akane Tsunemori who is assigned as an inspector to Division 1. Her inexperience and naivety hampers the team at first, but she quickly learns the intricacies of working in such a difficult environment. However, as this series progresses even that meets its limits when Division 1 encounters its biggest threat to the Sibyl System and society as a whole. \nThere are many positive things I can say about this series. The story was extremely strong. Gen Urobuchi really outdid himself in creating such an interesting plot with a wonderful cast of characters and topped it off with downright brilliant scriptwriting. You could see where Urobuchi really got his motivations and inspirations for creating such a story, referencing the works of the aforementioned Dick as well as George Orwell and many other sci-fi writers and philosophers. \nThe characters were another great strength to this series. While Akane did seem like a naive weak lead at first, it was fun watching her character grow as the series progressed. You could sense that while she was naive and overly timid at times, you could sense that she was a brilliant character, she just needed the chance to shine. The other lead of note is an Enforcer in Division 1 known as Shinya Kougami. He's what I'd consider a \"bad ass\" lead character with not only how physically gifted he is, but how observant and thorough he is when investigating. He's got a quiet personality and is a bit of a lone wolf, but he starts to work better with the team when Akane joins Division 1 and it gets him to open up a bit. It even causes him to get a better understanding of his own self and his own personal self-motivations. The rest of Division 1 makes for a rather interesting team, led by Inspector Nobuchika Ginoza. Ginoza is a somewhat young inspector in his own right, but his own ego and detail for following the Sibyl System makes him a difficult person to work with for Akane and the Enforcers alike. The Enforcers are made of Shuusei Kagari, a young Enforcer with a playful, easygoing personality, Tomomi Masaoka, an older Enforcer that serves as a source of wisdom for the team, and Yayoi Kunizuka, a quiet, stern Enforcer that shows little interest in her own colleagues besides Shion Karanomori, the team's technical specialist and hacker. While Division 1 was an interesting team to watch, what made this series go was its brilliant antagonist. This series makes it inherently clear from the first few minutes that it's main antagonist is clever young man known as Shougo Makishima. He is a criminal mastermind that uses his own brilliance and manipulation to pull off crimes of extreme nature in this future society. Division 1 becomes the focal point as the team in charge of bringing a stop to Makishima reign of terror. I'll be honest, Makishima is one of my favorite villains from any series I've ever watched. He's extremely cunning and uses a rather strange string of logic to justify his own actions. The crimes he commits and the criminals he manipulate are so sick, so disturbing that it made for an enjoyable watch to see how Division 1 would bring down this sick, twisted criminal. \nThe overall production of this series was fantastic. It had absolutely breathtaking animation and brilliant musical production. This was a pretty strong series from the direction of Naoyoshi Shiotani, which is surprising since he doesn't have much animation directing experience. However, he's been in the industry a long time and has worked as an animator for Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Blood-C, Sengoku Basara, and xxxHolic to name a few. Kyoji Asano's animation direction was top notch and great to see in action. In regards to the music, it was downright great, especially when it came to the series OPs and EDs. I would argue that Psycho-Pass had two of the best OPs and EDs I have ever seen to an anime. Of course, it seems like good things happen when Ryo and the Supercell team get involved. EGOIST, the performer of both EDs is one of my personal favorite up-and-coming artists and her songs Namae no nai Kaibutsu (Monster With No Name) and All Alone With You were two wonderful ending songs, even contrasting in styles. The series OPs were downright great from a visual standpoint and OP 2's Out of Control by Nothing's Carved In Stone was a wonderful OP song for the 2nd half of the series.\nWhile Psycho-Pass was a great anime, it wasn't without its faults...albeit they are quite minuscule. I found the conclusion to the series to be a rather weak one, especially considering the climax was so epic. I can tell that without a doubt that Urobuchi wants to continue this series at a later time. Overall, I just didn't find the conclusion to be overly satisfying, especially considering where the events leading into the final episode were going. Another area where I found the series to be lacking is there really isn't a whole lot of character development and interaction between the Division 1 team. There is very little back story amongst the Division 1 team and it made it a little difficult to become invested in their cause. It's a shame too, because there is a character death that occurs later in the series that I felt should've had a bigger impact...but didn't due to a lack of development with that character. The strange thing about it is one character that does get some back story and development comes completely out of left field and is one of the less likable characters within the team. Overall, I feel this series might have benefited from being a 24 episode series instead of a 22 because I did feel two additional episodes of character development and back story would've helped me as a viewer become more invested in the characters. \nOn the whole, Psycho-Pass is one of the best futuristic sci-fi animes you could watch, especially if you do like the detective genre. I found it to be intellectually satisfying with some excellent characters (Makishima himself makes it worth it), an intriguing plot, and a production value that is downright excellent. While it didn't have the strongest of finales, it was still a good finish to a great series and for those who are fans, it does enough to set up a sequel, whether that sequel comes in the form of a 2nd season or a movie is still for debate. If you're a fan of a series like GITS:SAC, Psycho-Pass is a must watch. At this point, I would call Psycho-Pass one of the best animes of 2012-2013 thus far.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    Gotta love a nice dystopia anime that keeps you hooked from start to finish. Here, Psycho Pass depicts a dystopian future for Japan where a computer system called the Sibyl System regularly monitors the mental states and conditions of the citizens to determine the likelihood of any of them committing a crime. If their mental state gets to a high enough point, they get labeled \"latent criminals\" and are isolated from society to either receive treatment at mental facilities (that many have little chance of even getting out of) or become Enforcers tasked with hunting down other criminals who are active in committing various crimes.\nPsycho\n          \n        Pass makes use of its setting to explore the extremes of a strictly-regulated society and human free will. In the case of the show's society, Psycho Pass explores the flaws of heavily entrusting technology to service human society at large as the Japanese human populace have left the Sibyl System to control and influence just about every element of society at large, from media control to terminating criminals without putting them through a judicial process to deciding career paths for a person that best benefit society. This could also be seen as a criticism of Japanese society's mentality of servicing group needs over the individual, as the series depicts that the Sibyl System was made in mind mostly to aid in servicing and benefiting society while overlooking human factors of the individual such as desire and morality. This especially becomes prevalent in later episodes when some pretty shocking secrets concerning the true nature of the Sibyl System are revealed.\nThe exploration of free will's extremes come in the form of the title's main antagonist, Shogo Maskishima. Throughout the series, he is depicted as a humanist with extreme beliefs in free will where humanity gives into their darkest desires with no hindrances, as he is shown to be the major influence behind the criminals that the Enforcers and Inspectors of Unit One confront in the show's earlier episodes. While knowing how flawed the Sibyl System is, Makishima appears to believe that there should be no regulatory body that exists to allow one to truly express themselves. Obviously, this mentality is flawed in that man will descend into chaos without some sort of order to keep humanity's darker impulses in check.\nMoving on from breaking down themes, Psycho Pass does do well in taking its time to explore its plot and characters. The first half of the series is focused on Akane and the members of Unit One dealing with several criminal cases that are eventually linked to Makishima and the second half explores the group trying to halt Makishima's activities with the mentioned shocking secrets on the Sibyl System eventually being revealed. The show takes the time to explore the backgrounds and relationships between characters within Unit One, even including how the Sibyl System effects the mentalities of many within the group. Akane gets some considerable development throughout the series as her character gradually changes as she becomes exposed to the realities of both being an Inspector in Unit One and the reality of the society that she is supposed to protect.\nIn terms of mood, the series is consistently depicted as a dark and violent one thanks to the heavy themes that the series dabbles into and the intense violence the show shows at points, which is especially notable when the Dominators of Unit One come into play to reduce criminal targets to a gory mess. The show's not even afraid to kill off civilians and even members of Unit One thanks to the shady characters seen throughout this series. As a result, this will certainly not be a series appropriate to show to younger audiences.\nThe show does have a few minor issues for me. While an interesting villain for the series, I did feel Makishima was more a symbol of the mentioned free will theme than a character as he never got any fleshing out for why he behaves as he does and why he believes in his extreme humanist beliefs. In addition, the series appeared to have an incomplete feel as life goes on with the Sibyl System controlling Japan and the fates of a few major characters are left unclear.\nVisually, Psycho Pass made for one of the better animated titles I seen from last year. There is plenty of detail shown in the Tokyo city landscapes and character designs with darker color tones made use of to emphasize the dark mood and themes of Psycho Pass. Character designs are diverse with each character having differing facial designs and clothing styles to complement the type of person they are. A good amount of CG animation was made use of in the designs of vehicles, robots and the various technologies used in the future world of the series, which does stick out prominently at many points in the series. Movements in Psycho Pass were very fluid for the most part with characters walking or running at a natural pace and there are a good number of engaging fight scenes that take place throughout the show between Unit One and other criminals, through either hand-to-hand or use of weapons.\nOverall, Psycho Pass may very will be one of the best titles I seen from 2012 with its excellent look into a dystopia future for Japan that has affected the populace on an individual and societal level and the engaging developments that members of Unit One face with their personal morals and confronting latent criminals throughout the series. If you don't mind a dark story with graphic violence depicted at points, then Psycho-Pass is a definite watch to look into. \n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    There are very few anime after 2010, that have that uniqueness, originality or captivating effect on the watcher. But it's anime like anime psycho pass that give me great hope for the future, especially since the announcement of a second season, but let me not get into that yet. Psycho pass is basically a bloody, sci-fi, action , psychological thriller anime that keeps you glued to your screen till the very end. I mean seriously, I did an 8pm to 6am all-nighter because of this anime. So if you really want a story that makes you curse the anime for not getting any sleep last\n          \n        night, yea, try psycho pass.\nI'm not going to go into the synopsis, as I trust that most of you reading this review would have done some prior research on the plot and also would have gotten an idea from wikipedia or other reviews or whatever. So let me just give you my honest, detailed review on this anime covering all the factors. So let us begin shall we?\nstory(9/10):\nNow when I mentioned originality earlier, I was expecting exactly what psycho pass is giving. Set in the future in a dark world, where gadgets called psycho passes can actually judge your mind and classify you as a criminal or an innocent member of society or even a new classification called a latent criminal( a person who has a high probability to become a criminal). Your mind will be clouded with questions with what you would think is right or wrong after seeing the events unfolding before your eyes on your screen. There are alot of dark moments so im going to say that it is not for the weak minded. But a few comedic moments , in between lighten the tension and also give you time to catch your breath. But all in all, the drama is intense. All you sci-fi fans, you will really appreciate( if not admire) the concepts that this anime enforces. I will let you watch the anime to find out for yourselves what i mean. No heavy romantic moments but alot of action scenes, so harem , romantic comedy and/or romantic drama lovers..stay away, this anime aint for you!\nThere are unfortunately a few( VERY FEW) boring scenes in this anime so i would fairly deduct a point but please don't judge this anime because of that because like i said, very few anime can actually grab your attention as well as psycho pass can.\nArt(8/10):\nPersonally, I'm not a huge judge on art but if you like the newer styles of animation enforced by the animation industry, you'll like psycho pass. But I like the character and outdoor/indoor setting designs are very good in my opinion  as well as the visual effects during the high-intense action and contemplation scenes.\nSound(8/10)\nI always say a good OST can make even a shitty anime into respectable one. Not to say psycho pass is shitty, but if psycho pass is highly rated already, it would be even even more highly rated because of it's soundtrack. The two intro's really give that that bad-ass cop story intro that psycho pass truly deserves. And let me tell you each episode(well most of them) ends with a drastic dramatic ending that is simply shocking. Add to that the two ending songs, it simply equals you being left in awe contemplating what you just saw. So, in the end two points deducted for the ost played in middle of the episodes during the scenes. (I'm not saying it's bad by itself, but with the scenes it may sound out of sync).\nCharacter(9/10):\nAll the characters here are unique, have different histories and different ideals about the justice system they live by. It's these clash of ideals that make you respect each of them and how they manage to work in the same team to catch the antagonist. Though all the characters deserve honorable mention I'm going topraise three characters the most:\n1. The protagonist Kougami Shinya, he is the definition of the cool, bad-ass cop with the typical \"f**k this shit, I'm going to catch him my own way\" type of thinking that we all respect and which also excites us. But what impresses me the most is the way he understands his enemy, and using his experience as well as deductive skills tpo trace him and seek him out. This sort of reminds me of the L and Light relationship of one guy always somehow managing to be one step ahead of the other when one is about to get caught. So, this guy amazes me with new tricks up his sleeve.\n2. Next is Tsunemori Akane, the female protagonist. What amazes me about her, is that, despite being subjected to hard life and torture of  a policewoman, who had to experience a whole bunch of trauma as the newbie, is still able to keep a clear head and hold on to her will and morals as a law enforcement officer, despite all that, is truly admirable( and a big deal if you live in that sort of world...you'll understand what I mean when you see it). Overall, she strikes as mettlesome and devoted to do her duty even if she has to do it the hard way. She is one who develops drastically as the anime progresses.\n3.Now finally the antagonist, Makishima, Shougo. This guy is probably as cool as any cucumber can ever be. But as lethal as a dose of the most toxic of toxins out there in the world. He reminds me of the joker(from the dark night) in a way that he believes he's helping society by letting them express their true selves in order to rebel against the limitations of the current justice system. But belive me, in scary, terrible ways can he emerge from from that innocent nice guy shell into a wasp that can only nfict pain. He also has qualities that would draw curosity towards him. For example he cannot be judged by the system(why?..i'll let you find that out by yourselves). So, this guy who guy is someone whom you can both admire and fear, a certain character which could explain why this anime is just THAT popular.\nOverall(10/10)\nI'm going to club both my overall rating and my enjoyment rating together. Despite a few flaws I just cannot and will not deny that I just loved this anime, from it's character situations, to the myseries and action sequences and the sci-fi ideas used and twists in the plot, all I want to say is this: bravo Shiotani, Naoyoshi , bravo  Production I.G and bravo everybody else who is a part of this animes development, you have done well. So I am going to say that despite giving lower ratings to other factors individually, I'm going to give this anime a perfect score for this sole reason: It entertained me very well!!\n\nPS: This my first anime review, despite watching a variety of anime for over a year now, and I'm glad to say that I believe I have done quite satisfactorily. But for yo major critics out there, all I can say is to please spare me this time and I will try to learn the trades of writing the \"ideal\" review given some time. Cheers yall!!!\n\n"},

All i can say about this anime is that it thoroughly impressed me from start to finish. It is EXACTLY the type of anime that peaks the interest of watchers who are into dark/sci-fi genre with it's ability to produce both a psychological sense of mind awareness as well as it's inexplicable presentation of the type of mental ID called \"psycho-pass\" which allows for judgment of one's psychological state of mind.\nThe characters were also outstanding, they all had their own unique traits to support their psycho-pass's details without issue. The idea of not just having Inspectors as detectives, but enforcers as\n          \n        well was done superbly. I especially liked (SPOILER ALERT:) Makishima Shogou's view on the current system as being unidealistic, stale, and limiting as well as unfair to the current human state while still depicting him as a villain (kind of really reminded me of Lelouch :P).\nThere's also a big type of morale to the story which makes me people think whether it's right or wrong to have a system that judges your actions and your right to live, die, or become part of the system. This idea was presented well on us during episode 1 where the kidnapped lady's criminal thoughts escalated so high that the system has chosen to execute her for merely being  a victim.\nThe art was superb, especially during the second opening where it depicted an artistic expression of the story and the soundtrack was very well done, except that it wasn't really...explosive..as to say.\nOverall Psycho-Pass is an amazing work created by Production I.G. that i think   is a well-deserved spot in the top rankings as well as one of my favorite series.\ntl;dr: Psycho-pass messed with my brain a lot, it was scifi-ey a lot and it's characters were 2cool4me. 9/10\n        "},

Pyscho Pass is a great example of combining sci-fi and psychology with sucess.\nThis is an intelligent anime, it focuses on examining the the nature of people specifically regarding the issue of free will and why the characters do the things they do. It pays tribute to artists and writers whose works the plot is centered around, and As a fan of sci-fi and psychology this was a real treat.\nIn regards to the plot,\n          \n        Pyscho Pass is set in a futuristic Japan which has been transformed into a Utopian/Dystopian society (depending how you view it). The hue (mental state) and crime coefficient (likeliness of committing a serious crime) are constantly monitored. Anyone displaying dangerous signs are removed from society. In essence there is peace but this conflicts with exercising free will, this is the premise for the villain to cause instability in hopes of collapsing the system in order for people to be free. \nThe art and voice acting in this anime along with the action scenes are great and the main characters do have depth. However this show does begin to lose steam towards the end when it becomes more of a detective show, and the end just fades away.  Whether it was to accommodate a second season or not i'm not sure. Overall i found this anime to be amazing and would definitely recommend it. \nAlso i really want those guns they use...\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    So, I'll say it straight out: WATCH PSYCHO-PASS.\nLately, watching anime has been a total drag. I can't seem to find anything that interests me anymore. I spent some days watching Hamatora (and the new season just started, by the way), K, and such animes. Watching them was fun- like, the characters were great and the animation and the graphics are outstanding. But none of them really gripped me.\nThen suddenly, here comes Psycho-Pass. \nPsycho-Pass literally had me on the edge of my seat. Not only are the characters great and the visuals amazing, so is the plot. The whole concept of the anime is amazing, from\n          \n        the Sibyl System to the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division's concept of the Investigators and Enforcers. You will be left in awe and frustration as they uncover the truth to twists and turns. Psycho-Pass gives you the usual question, \"Who is the real enemy?\"\nPsycho-Pass is full of action and gore. We have evil geniuses and grotesque crimes. But there's also the Enforcers, who are just as equally criminal-minded. The portrayal of the relationships between the characters are very professional, so if you don't like too much romance like me, this is perfect. But there is a beautiful portrayal of a budding friendship and human understanding, which is all part of the most beautiful character development I have ever seen. \nBut the ending of the first season will have you jumping up and down in joy for the upcoming second season because of the lack of closure. Though, I have to say, even if there was no second season, it could have been quite an interesting end. It would've put every difference in the world in comparison to other animes of the same kind. But still, it would've been quite unsatisfying. We could only hope that they will finally put an end to the Sibyl System in the second season.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Man, what took me so long to get around to watching this? I had heard mixed things about Psycho-Pass so I was never sure how high up on the priority bracket I wanted to place it. Some claimed it was a philosophical masterpiece and some claimed that the \"Urobutcher\", as some refer to him as, struck again. Personally, I'm a big fan of Gen Urobuchi from what works of his I've seen thus far. Fate/Zero is one of, if not my number one, favorite anime and I also really enjoyed the Madoka series + the Rebellion movie. So I finally got around to watching this\n          \n        while fully expecting another solid experience and I was not disappointed. I may have even been a little surprised by how good Psycho-Pass was.\nThe details of the setting can be pretty much summed up in the synopsis so I won't bore you with that. The system in place in this setting is referred to as the \"Sibyl System\" which is something the synopsis doesn't cover so I'll just clear that up to prevent future confusion in this review. The setting is really well laid-out and it's easy to see from the first couple episodes how this futuristic society operates through the process of the Sibyl System. It's also easy to see that there is fundamental flaws in how it operates (such as the lack of any type of measurement for crime beyond what the Sibyl System is able to quantify and recognize) and the viewer can make inferences to try and predict how these flaws in the system will cause future conflict for the characters. \nI won't delve into story specifics because of spoilers so I'll just discuss the story in vague terms of what it does well. Part of the satisfaction of Psycho-Pass is the early recognition from a viewer's standpoint that something will definitely go wrong at some point, but you have no idea what it will be or when it will be so you are just as shocked by it as the characters in the show are. The show has multiple \"cases\" that take place and watching the detectives, in particular Kogami, solve them is a very engaging experience. It does a good job giving the viewer hints and clues as to what might happen next which keeps the viewer actively involved in trying to solve the problem alongside the characters. The pacing for the story is also very well-done. There was never a moment where I felt like something was rushed nor were there any moments where I felt something was unnecessarily dragged out. \nThe characters were really the strong point of the show in my opinion. Akane, Kogami, and Makishima are the only ones listed as \"main\" characters on here, but the roster as a whole is very well developed and you could make an argument that both Ginoza and Masaoka are main characters as well. The sheer cunning of both Kogami and Makishima makes for an interesting viewing experience because they're both always one step ahead of all the other characters as well as a half-step ahead of each other. Masaoka is the likeable old guy archetype that helps bring the young people along. Ginoza is a bit of a weird one for me because of how he acted sometimes. He would do things that I liked and things I disliked at an almost perfect 50/50 ratio, but I can't deny that his development was satisfying to see come to fruition. One of the best aspects of the show was Kogami's exceptional detective work that never failed to impress me. It always kept me engaged when he would be on-screen trying to solve a case. However, the development of Akane in particular is what really impressed me so I'll talk about her in particular as well as her role as a co-protagonist alongside Kogami.\nFemale leads are very hit-or-miss in anime (not to sound sexist) because they're rarely properly developed. They either default to the \"damsel in distress\" role, lack the fortitude in decision-making required of a true protagonist , or they're simply poorly written and thus their personalities become annoying. Lucy from Fairy Tail is a great example of all of these but, anyway, moving on. Akane's development was very impressive in part because of how visible it was. Every time she had to make a decision it was always clearly evident how she had grown since her last decision. She's the kind of character that learned from her mistakes and thinks carefully before moving forward. A lot of people I talk to cite a particular scene from episode 11 as one of the reasons they dislike Akane, but I disagree. Her character was extremely well developed due in large part because of what took place in that episode. For better or worse, she went from a timid and naive girl who was lacking confidence at the beginning of the show to being a confident woman who took her role as a protagonist and fulfilled it extremely well by the end of the show. Her development reminded me a lot of Yona from Akatsuki no Yona. Fans of the show will definitely see the similarities in development.\nThe art in the show is very good. All the characters are designed very well and realistically and the city environment looks gorgeous. The animation is very fluid and the fights are very well choreographed. My only complaint would be that some of the characters, specifically the characters who aren't important to the show long-term, almost look like they have bug-eyes. I'm unsure if this was intentional of if it was just a goof in the character design of the less-important characters. Either way it did bug me (no pun intended), but at the same time it didn't have any huge negative effect on the show since those characters are not on screen much.\nThe sound is one part of Psycho-Pass I was disappointed in. The first OP is incredible and both EDs are good but the background music used is just really forgettable. There is one track in particular that was used during action scenes and \"oh shit!\" scenes as I call them that always caught my ear but the rest of the background music was honestly very average. It did a good job in some scenes of setting up an atmosphere but overall it could have been better. \nI really did enjoy Psycho-Pass. Trying to figure out the problems to the cases alongside Akane and Kogami, trying to guess what Makishima might do next, learning more about the Sibyl System and this futuristic society and trying to find the flaws in it- the whole show did a great job of keeping my interest engaged. I loved the roster of characters and in particular was very pleased with Akane's development. The art was nice and the animation was fluid and the sound, although average, was solid enough to not leave a negative impression. I would recommend Psycho-Pass to anyone and encourage people to give it a shot even though \"the Urobutcher\" has a very mixed reputation here on MAL. I loved both Fate/Zero and Madoka Magicka and this was another show I really enjoyed. \nStory: 9/10\nArt: 9/10\nSound: 7:10\nCharacters: 10/10\nEnjoyment: 9/10\nOverall: 9/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I LIIIVE!!!!!! After what may be the most traumatizing moment in my life, I guess I’m ready to write my 10th review. And what better way to kick it off, than to start with a marathon, or in this case compilation, of Sci-Fi reviews, and start with one of my favorite Sci-fi anime, besides Cowboy Bebop, Psycho-Pass.\nAfter the critical success of Mahu Shoujo Madoka Magica, Katsuyuki Motohiro reached out to Gen Urobuchi as the series writer, and Naoyoshi Shiotani, as the director. He wanted to make an anime series inspired by live-action movies like L.A. Confidential, Minority Report (One of my personal favorite), Brazil, and\n          \n        Blade Runner, and Mamoru Oshii’s Ghost in the Shell and Patlabor. They went as far as to ban ‘moe’ from the development of the series; going as far as to forbid anyone to mentions the word. I am a sucker for crime detective TV series, like Person of Interest, Castle, and, my personal favorite from the category, The Blacklist. So let’s start the compilation and suit up for Psycho-Pass.\nStory – 10/10\nI have to be honest here, the moment I laid eyes on the first episode, I was hooked. Just from the sneak peak to future events, we are already pumped for the fated encounter of our man, Shinya Kougami, and every one’s bad boy, Shougo Makishima. And then the episode cuts to present day. Just from that one introduction alone, we know that our protagonists are already embarking on an epic journey that will change, NOT who they are, but what defines them. The story has a neat way of dragging the protagonist, and by extension the viewer, into the fray. The story also does a sound job of world-building. When the team takes on a case, we, the viewer, also get to learn a little more about how the world works, and see how it fits into the case. The thing about dystopian fantasy is that it shows how perfectly flawed it can be compared to our world. Sure, it looks better, but do you REALLY want to live in a world where posting videos of cute kittens are considered taboo, and shaming a woman, who only asked for seconds, appropriate? Mr. Bumble might agree, but then again he’s not the guy getting shamed, but rather doing it *shrug*. It looks utopian, yet upon closer inspection, you might end up changing your mind. And the show portrays that very well. We don’t like it, but what other choice do we have? It’s not like there’s any other country where you can get the BEST burritos. The show also deals with stuff like revenge, individuality, independence from the higher ups when it comes to making our own choices, etc. And the best part is that the show never lets the viewer slip from its grasp. It’s engaging, and the cliffhangers are spot on, enough to make you want to watch the next episode right away.\nArt – 10/10 (9.9/10)\nAh, the art. What is there to say when Production I.G. is behind the wheels of the series? They did a good of implementing CG at the right moment, the coloring and background perfectly sets the mood for the series, and characters give off a noir feel to them. The characters are designed so that they do not stand out. Which is why most of the characters are seen wearing black, white and a variety of dark colors, rather than yellow, orange or, dare I say it, pink (No detective in a dystopian setting would be caught in a gunfight….wearing pink). The show also does a good job of using color as more than just coloring the characters. No, no, no, rather they are used to convey the character’s inner ‘Psycho-Pass’, which is used to measure the individual’s mind to check for any possibility of a potential crime. For example, turquoise is calm and clear-minded, red is anger and violence, and black, is just downright bad. If you didn’t notice the readings get lower and lower as the color darkens, let’s see you name a show where colors accurately represent the emotions of a character. Now after around episode 16, the team ‘ran out of stamina’ and the animation might falter. However, I didn’t find this problem in the extended version, so you might want to watch that version. See where the 0.1 went? Overall, it isn’t that bad and the error shouldn’t faze you out of the show. I guess that’s everything. Either that or I’m too lazy and I just want to get to the Sound and Character section already.\nBut I’m not done yet. Let’s talk about the Dominator, the series’ signature weapon. It looks sleek; its neon blue (Who DOESN’T want a neon blue gun? Definitely not the tactical squad, that’s for sure). In the world of Psycho-Pass, it’s the very symbol of justice, which is cruel when you take a closer look at it. And there’s gore, plenty to make you beg for more, but scarce to make sure it doesn’t get boring.\nSound – 9.8/10\nThe OST was orchestrated by Yugo Kanno, who would later work on Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders and Diamond is Unbreakable. Was it good? THE GUY DID THE OST FOR JJBA, OF COURSE HE’S GOOD! The OST reminds me of the aforementioned TV series, but with a good old futuristic twist to them. Whenever they’re chasing a criminal, whenever they investigate a crime scene, when the job is done and they call it a day, or even when they’re having a conversation, the OST always does a good job of making us feel pumped, interested, relaxed, and tense, respectively. And this helps in the immersion, it’s the other reason I got hooked. Now, as for the OP…..other than the 1st one, which was pretty good, the 2nd one is total shit (Cut open my skull, really?) in the opening lyrics department, but least it’s hummable (Just censor the cut open my skull part if you’re feeling squeamish), but visually it was more deep than the 1st OP, which was more of a tone setter, so, looking back, it wasn’t that bad as I thought it too be. As for the ED, it’s a masterpiece. The ED is just great, it’s brilliant, and also does a good job of ending the episode on a brilliant note. And get this, the 1st and 2nd ED was done by, drum roll please!\nEGOIST!! Yes, the same bands from Guilty Crown, who would later come back in Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress.  If you don’t know what I mean, check it out. Although I highly recommend against that, since its best experienced when watching the show.\nAs for the Seiyuu, well judging from the word ‘Seiyuu’ alone, I watched it subbed. Kana Hanazawa voices Akane Tsunemori, and does a great job of portraying her role (It’s fricking Kana Hanazawa, what did you expect?) And on the topic of doing a great job of portraying their role, Tomokazu Seki voices the brooding cop with a tragic past, Shinya Kougami, and Takahiro Sakurai as the white-haired terrorist who wants to return individuality to humanity, Shougo Makishima (Well, he has been known to voice, surprise surprise, other white haired characters like Griffith from Berserk (2016), Haine Rammsteiner from Dogs: Bullets and Carnage, and Ja’Far from Magi. but he also did the voice of Suzaku Kururugi from Code Geass, and Rohan Kishibe from JJBA:DiU).  Everyone did their job so well, I don’t know if the dub the can top that. Now let’s lazily finish off this section so that I can move on to the next part – the Characters, which makes the efforts of everyone mentioned above well spent.\nCharacters – 10/10 (9.99999999999/10)\nThe best part of Gen Urobuchi’s work, is that the characters are the best part of it. He made Caster, from Fate/Zero, one of the most questionably likable characters (As for me, I’m on Team Lancer), and made the back story of Emiya Kiritsugu so tragic and painful. In this case, the characters of Psycho-Pass are no different from amazing. We have Akane Tsunemori, an honest woman who wants to uphold justice, Shinya Kougami, a brooding enforcer whose tragic past got him demoted to the place he is in and is now struggling whether he should uphold the law, or just say, ”Fuck it, I’m going to kill that *%^$#^%^&!!!” , Nobuchika Ginoza, Akane’s superior who does not always agree with her views on how to handle the situation, no matter how humane it is, but does it so that she doesn’t end up like ‘all the others’, and then we have the main villain, Shougo Makishima. The interesting part of this is that they represent ideological views, such as individuality, human logic and the right choice. As for the side characters, they were just as good as the main ones. Tomomi Masaoka and Shuusei Kagari are my favorites from this category, because they‘re always there when they want to take things down a notch when things get too heated and help Akane grow and adapt to the very system, that put them in the really crappy position they are in now (Who wants to be called a dog by the higher ups, let alone your own children? I thought black was supposed to be cool!?!). However, the most underdeveloped character *MEGA GASP* has to go to Yayoi, they mentioned her back story and they didn’t explore that, which was rather off-putting. At first, we see Akane as a rookie, she doesn’t have enough experience in the field and usually ends up in REALLY deep shit, but as the series progresses, we get to see her grow more as an investigator and as a character we can grow to care for. But then again, if I write one more word about her, let alone the other characters, I’ll only ruin the fun. Characters like them aren’t something descriptive, but rather, theological. So, it’s best that I stop talking about the characters before I accidentally suck the fun out of experiencing them. \nEnjoyment – 10/10\nIt’s one of my favorite anime of all time, OF COURSE I ENJOYED IT!!! There’s always enough action to keep you pumped, enough psychological drama to keep you on the edge of your seat, and suspense to keep you wanting for more. I binge watched this series and it took me THREE days. Normally it would take around five, but I didn’t give two craps about everything else and just kept watching. It’s no wonder it still holds up today as one of the best Psychological/Thriller/Crime/Cyberpunk/Suspense anime series ever made. There was a giddy TV lover in me that came back and made comparisons to the TV shows I watched in the past. If the producers want to make a series that translated well when made into a live-action adaptation (I see Liam Neeson and Scarlett Johansson as NY investigators, in a world where New York City has embraced the Sibyl System, with Cristopher Nolan or Quentin Tarantino as the director, or you can call the guys behind the Marvel movies. That’ll work), then they did an excellent job at it. However, one thing that bummed me out was the sequel, which sucked balls. It was criminally subpar compared to its predecessor. It was SO bad, that electric chair, guillotine and Batman & Robin, was not worthy enough as a capital punishment for it. However, the movie did an excellent job at doing what the sequel should’ve done, and that closure is good enough for me. HELL! There’s a visual novel out RIGHT NOW, and sadly, being where I am, I won’t be able to enjoy it. *thump thump THUMP Spludge SPLAT thump bump*\nOverall – 10/10\nIn the grand scheme of things, do I, SirKnight007, recommend Psycho-Pass, a modern masterpie….NO SHIT SHERLOCKE!!! If you like Psychological, Crime Noir, any work by Gen Urobuchi, or TV shows and movies that I mentioned before, then Psycho-Pass will be an experience you’ll treasure for days to come. It never loses its audience no matter how long the exposition, the characters are interesting no matter how much the main protagonists shine, and the underlying theme of a perfect society and what it is worth will always haunt us no matter how many literary references you can find. If you want a show like that, then I highly recommend you give it a watch RIGHT NOW. Chances are you might finish it in three days or less.\nWell, looks like the compilation is going smoothly. Do check out the next review where I cover a movie that REALLY knows how to give the best Crime/Psychological/Thriller/Cyberpunk/Suspense anime good closure.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Psycho-Pass is an illuminating work of art.\nOne of the most thought provoking anime out there, it is perhaps allegorical in nature as we stand on a huge leap of technological progress. It insightfully examines how the intersection of morality with science could lead to exceptionally interesting circumstances. With an excellent character cast to boot, what could go wrong?\nIt turns out to be very little.\nThe story itself is paced excellently, with engaging action interspersed with thought provoking situations that would put to the test the meaning of existence in the society that is masterfully created by the animators. Watching interesting technological innovations do their work in\n          \n        the world envisioned was beautiful, to say the least, and practically all scenes were supported by relevant non-diegetic music. In fact it is paced in such a way that everything feels just right, from beginning to (mostly) the end.\nWhen an anime is able to turn simple action scenes into not just mental battles but a clash of ideals, a clash of what they want to see for the future, it is clear that the writers have clearly thought through the implications of what they chose to tell. This can be seen through a rigorous intellectual examination of the benefits and negatives of a society governed the way it is. The female protagonist, the 'villain' and the so called computer system, as characters, deserve special praise for their practically perfect scripting, for their actions and mannerisms, even for their various statements that they make that betray their ideals.\nIf there are to be criticisms, it would ultimately lie with the the last episode, the way in which the ending was somewhat ambiguous to one of the main characters, and the somewhat dissonance between the animation of things like the special gun characters use and the smooth animation of the police van, to the somewhat plain animation of some characters like the two main inspectors that we get to see. However, such quibbles are, in a sense, meaningless, as the anime is so thought provoking to the extent that it is unnecessary to even point out these things. However (this does not affect my score but), it should be noted that some of the concepts discussed in the anime do require some thinking and might not be suitable for youngsters.\nWith all that in mind, Psycho-Pass is a must see. 10/10.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    *tl;dr at the bottom of the page\n*this review is solely for season one of Psycho Pass \nPsycho Pass is a solid and memorable anime that brings us again to the question of choice between a society with order and a society where people are free. In a futuristic society, it is possible to measure a person's state of mind with a number called a crime coefficient with the sibyl system, a government agency that overlooks law enforcement. Those with a high crime coefficient are more likely to commit crimes. We follow a group of police called the MWPSB as they try to keep order by\n          \n        going after people with high crime coefficients.  \nThe plot immediately reminded me of some of the futuristic dystopian novels that I've read before.  This anime does take its time to show us what it is like living in the world where things are determined by the sibyl system instead of human conscience. It also reinforces the notion that \"things might not always be what they seem to be\" which made the plot extremely interesting. One thing that I especially like was the action scenes where they showed members of the MWPSB battling and chasing after those with high criminal coefficients. The action scenes were tense and really drew me into this anime. The one problem I had with the plot is that the pacing of first part of the anime can be quite slow at times but it gets much better near the middle of the anime.  \nThe animation is simply great. I really liked how darker colors are used effectively to show the dark atmosphere that this anime has and it reminded me of other animes like death note. The music in this anime is what you would expect from this genre of anime. The first opening is my personal favorite but I liked most of the osts a lot as well. \nAnd now we get to the characters. I honestly wanted to give Psycho Pass a 9 but gave it an 8 instead because of its characters. There are some characters that are very well done, some who are done pretty well and other characters that I didn't like how they were handled. Because of this, I will present the characters in three groups. \nThe first group is the characters that are very well done, Makishima, Kougami, Ginoza and Kasei. Makishima is the main antagonist of the show. I really liked his personality and cheerful charisma and the show presents him as the center of the argument for freedom over order. It makes you question if her is truly the \"antagonist\". Kougami and Ginoza are both police under MWPSB in division 1. Ginoza's relationship and development with other members of division 1 really made him stand out as a character and made him memorable. Kougami is another member of division 1 who is a very smart and efficient enforcement officer that took an interesting turn later in the show. Kasei is the head of the MWPSB and is presented as the center of the argument for order over freedom. Like Makishima, you sometimes question whether Kasei is truly good or evil. \nThe second group is the characters that were pretty well done, Akane and Masaoka. Akane is a character that I could say a lot about. She is the new member of division 1. While her actions are sometimes so frustrating that you would want to quit this anime, but she develops a lot over the course of the anime as well that you actually grow to understand and love her as a character. Masaoka acts as a mentor and guide to the Akane as she is new and is a very wise man. \nThe third group are the poorly handed characters, Kagari and Kunizuka, who are both members of division 1. We get a whole episode featuring Kunizuka's backstory and yet the anime fails to let her do very much in the story. The way this anime handled Kagari is terrible and he gets 0 character develop and no backstory, but I won't go into much details. \nDespite its minor flaws with its plot and its characters, I still really enjoyed this anime and would definitely recommend it to anyone who like sci-fi, dystopian, psychological or police animes. It will really get you thinking. \n\"Enough you idiot! Shorten it to 20 words or less!\" -Saitama (One Punch Man)\n(tl;dr) PP is a great anime that brings up interesting questions about society despite its minor flaws in plot and characters. \n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Irredeemable. On the flip side, I will say I showed the point of no return to my friend, who was like \"Wow, that actually seems really interesting.\" I just really didn't like Akane and the beliefs that played out.\nAnd that's really what this anime will hinge on: do you like Akane, or no? If you don't, for the love of God do not watch this anime. For any/all posts that say \"But Shinya Kougami is cool/interesting\" - it's not worth it; Akane is definitely a driving factor in the story.\nI will say the plot definitely has interesting twists and moments, but it'll really hinge on\n          \n        how much you like that kind of futuristic society. Do you like it/find it interesting, or does it vex you? If you've ever searched in vain trying to find movies about real freedom and independence, then you probably won't be satisfied with everything that plays out in this anime.\nIf you like it, watch it; it'll be a piece of work that is constructed and it's put together decently. But if you don't like it, then don't watch it. If you start finding yourself more than slightly dissatisfied, I would drop it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    First, I feel it is important I make it clear what I have liked in the past, as this makes it easier for you to decide whether or not to believe my opinion. I loved Guilty Crown, and Angel Beats most, and if you are in a position where you hate both of them, likelihood is this review won't hold truth for you.\nOk, Psycho-Pass, if you just want to know if it is worth watching the answer is yes, but if you want to know why, here I go.\nPsycho-Pass starts off with an interesting premise; a future where guns tell their operators who they can\n          \n        and can't shoot, based on a number which represents the likelihood of someone committing a crime, this number is known as someone's crime co-efficient. If it is under 100, no action should be taken, over 100 but under 300, the gun operates as a stun-gun, and over 300, it kills. But here lies what the series tries to question - in the spur of the moment, one's crime co-efficient may raise, especially after trauma, and so the first arc really tries to ask if it is ethically Ok to shoot, a question our main character Akane seems to ask a lot more than others. The second arc explores the question of if a system can be perfect, and what happens to the few who slip past the system, for the most interesting part of the series. So now into the nitty gritty:\n====Sound and Music====(9)\nBoth the dub and original Japanese audio are of high quality, as well as the general insert sounds. The Egoist (remember, the band that did the Guilty Crown music) endings fit the show perfectly, but I cannot really say that for the openings, which just didn't click for me.\n====Visuals====(8)\nProduction IG does a good job creating the cyberpunk world and visual style of Psycho Pass, really nothing to complain about here. The overall animation quality, and character quality isn't Guilty Crown good, but it is still damn good. My only gripe is with the visual design of the innards of the Sibyl System.\n====Character====(8)\nOverall, the cast of Psycho Pass is diverse and well developed, again, there really isn't anything to complain about here, but at the same there isn't an outstanding amount of character development, as most of the show focuses on the story rather than the characters. I would have enjoyed a bit more character development.\n====Story====(10)\nThis is definitely where Psycho Pass excels. The story makes sense and flows, the overarching themes of conspiracy are well executed, and there were points where my jaw literally dropped, due to plot twists. It is very successful at making you question Sibyl.\n====Enjoyment====(9)\nI really enjoyed Psycho Pass, but at the same time, it wasn't a perfect show, and in some areas left a bit to be desired. But overall, Psycho Pass is definitely worth a watch, no doubt about it.\n====Overall====\nOverall, Psycho Pass is a great show, the story is deep, the visuals are pretty, the ending themes and other sounds are great, and the characters are interesting. Overall, I would give Psycho Pass 9 out of 10, so, close to perfect.\n        "},

And the concept of this story is brilliant, as well. Initially, I didn't think the Sibyl System was all that bad (until I learned more about it as the season went on). In fact, I almost thought it was good idea, but I learned very quickly that that was not the case.\nAnyway, I'm not here to talk about that. Can I just say: HELLO, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! Akane's development throughout this entire season was beyond amazing. It was very well thought out, very gradual, and it made sense. I can't\n          \n        think of another anime that developed it's main character so masterfully. \nAnd Ko was just... oh my goodness. That man needs to be mine. He's so badass and cool and suave. Definitely one of my favorite characters in anime. \nEvery other member of Division 1 is so awesome, as well. They're such full, rounded characters. The story was slightly confusing toward the end, which is what kept me from giving this anime a perfect 10, but honestly, I'd recommend this to everyone. It was bomb.\n        "},

It captures an ideal world that would suit the modern day idea of a cyberpunk reality, only very much more realistic than anything I have seen so far. We start with a new girl named Akane Tsunemori, who at the beginning is a\n          \n        new Inspector working for Division 1. She is administered on her first day on the job to help take out someone who has an elevated psycho-pass, and from there slowly learns what it's really like to be an inspector, and what the hard truth could be. It's an interesting trip to figure out who the real bad-guy is here, and it'll have you thinking.\nNow like I said earlier, the art in this anime is outstanding. It captures Cyberpunk in every way possible and turns it into any cyberpunk-lovers dream-come true. It's a true work of art. Now as for the sound, I highly enjoy the first OP, I even downloaded it, but the change from the first to the second wasn't too great. The environmental sounds and the sound design here are phenomenal. Even all the way down to the dominators sound is quite compelling to listen to.\nNow we've already talked about Akene, but what about the rest of the characters. To start, she is on the line with some \"hounds\" who in this case are just lower-ranked inspectors, called enforcers, who *mostly* do all the dirty work. You have Kougami, who got de-ranked because of his past stories and history with the cost of being an inspector. And then you have Masaoka/Yayoi/and Kagari, who all have interesting backstories to cover.\nAll in all you have a cyberpunk heaven here for anyone (like myself) who enjoys the enthralling nature of cyberpunk. But you also have a very interesting situation and story, as well as intriguing characters and some backstories that are harsh to think about.\nI highly recommend this to anyone who likes an interesting twist on our not-so distant future, or who just likes anything else I may have said.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    Psycho-Pass basically is a dystopian sci-fi anime setting up  the all-seeing Sibyl system as its government. And like all dystopian stories, Psycho-Pass proceeds to criticize and point out all the flaws of the Sibyl System. It follows Division 1 of the MWPSB, Japan's police force as they track down the mysterious Makeshima, who threatens to overturn society. \nBasically, Sibyl system  monitors everyone's psyche and predicts their likelihood of crime in the form of a number, the crime coefficient, which can be measured using futuristic guns wielded by the police. If it's too high, an individual is marked for arrest and the guns are\n          \n        able to stun the target. If it's not, the gun is locked. If it's excessively high, then the gun changes from stun to kill (quite brutally). As shown in the first episode, this number mainly is tied to stress and as a result everyone is obsessed with taking care of their stress. Of course, the whole point is asking whether \"latent criminals\" are really criminals. Often victims of crimes end up with raised coefficients and are usually arrested along with their attackers. \nAll the while we're posed with the question of whether latent criminals are actually criminals, the story's main conflict actually comes from whether an individual can be a criminal but not a latent criminal. That is, can someone's coefficient stay low even while they commit horrid crimes? And how will the omniscient Sibyl System judge such an individual? What does justice mean in this futuristic society?\nA lot of people criticize the characters' actions. \"Why didn't they just do this, I would have done this\" and yes characters' actions can be frustrating, but as long as the actions have reason behind them, it's ridiculous to judge characters in this manner. These characters are not you. They will not act how you would act. \nAs for pacing, I think it's fine. It starts out with individual crimes, introducing different facets of this society. Eventually there starts to be links between the crimes funneling the show into the main conflict.\nAs for the characters themselves, in a crime anime, it's not unforgivable for the police to be bland if the criminals are colorful. While most don't last very long, I think the criminals are interesting enough to give this series a pass. The main villain in particular is more than compelling enough. Criticism of the characters is mainly aimed at the MC, Akane Tsunemori. However, I think she's far from bland. She does have development, and she upholds her ideals to the utmost. A quote from the 2nd season, she \"understands the value of life\" even in this dystopia where people have lost what it means to be human. The foil, Kogami, is static, but he's intended as the gravitational force to shape Akane from the newbie that doesn't know what she's doing to the calm detective who strives for justice. Importantly, Akane never becomes Kogami (like the moon never hits the Earth) but Kogami's influence on Akane's development is undeniable. \nArt and sound: The action scenes are decent enough, nothing spectacular. Again, the show's main focus is on the philosophy of crime and justice. Soundtrack is pretty good, but again not spectacular. The general vibe from the artwork is pretty bright for a dystopian anime. It isn't mind blowing, but I wouldn't say the art and sound detract from the overall enjoyment.\nIf you're into philosophy, dystopias, or general crime and detective stories, you should definitely watch. Even if you hate the characters, the artwork, or whatever, it's still worth watching because of how the themes of morality and justice are tied into the story. I won't give it a 9/10 because it didn't blow my mind but I definitely enjoyed it throughout.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    Crime Thriller has always been one of my favorite genres. In Anime Ive seen two; Death Note and Monster, and both were great. Psycho Pass is a series that I first heard about years ago but for w.e reason I never watched it. I decided to watch this dubbed cuz lets be honest Funimation is great at dubbing. And after finally getting to watch it here's what I thought of it.***contains MINOR spoilers***\nStory:9/10\nWell paced and brilliantly written. Where the story becomes unique is its setting which btw is beautifully explored, and introduces us to a world that humanity might come across in the future. It\n          \n        also explores some interesting themes such as anarchy, authoritarianism, and political philosophy. What I love about this story is that it makes you question the values and sanity of humans. One of the biggest highlights here is when it focuses on the relationship between the two protagonists who both have different worldviews and this is where its paced very well. The only flaw here is that the story tends to lose focus but that's mainly cuz a lot of times it focuses on exploring it's dystopian setting.\nArt:9/10\nVery good animation wit a cyberpunk feel to it. What really impressed me were the character designs, some animes have a bad habit of giving most their characters the same eyes and face but this series doesn't do that. Their detailed very well giving most of the characters their own look and making it easier to recognize them. The biggest standout however was the cinematography particularly in its action scenes. It gave the action that extra impact and gave it a great look. The futuristic technology were portrayed beautifully and the gore was done well adding maturity to the art. The few flaws here were that at times the series looked too generic and I noticed that there were some female characters that had eyelashes on the side of their eyes instead of the top. And it kinda bothered me.\nSound:9/10\nThe openings and ending songs here are awesome. The first OP \"Abnormalize\" is my favorite song of the whole soundtrack. It had a great mature thrilling sound to it that perfectly sets up the episodes and it's so catchy. My favorite thing about the soundtrack as a whole is that it doesn't just stick to one style, it'll use a couple like classical and techno to fit the scenes. Ironically however, I wasn't crazy about the background music. There wasn't really one background song that I really enjoyed and that kinda disappointed me. As for dubbing, it did a very solid job. I have to single out Alex Organ's performance as Makishima cuz he did an outstanding job. Kinda like what I said earlier, Funiamtion usually has great dubbing and I wasn't disappointed here.\nCharacter:8/10\nA very good cast. What the cast does very well here is how we emotionally relate to most of them. My favorite here has to be Shinya Kogami, what loved so much was his role in the series, the true plot unfolds based off his actions. Kogami has his own plans and his actions are based off this. He's very cool, level headed, non-hesitant, and very complicated, it's hard to tell if his intentions are good or bad. He doesn't however get that much development at least compared to the female lead Akane. She initially starts off as a typical new female cop you see in dramas being naïve and uninteresting, but her growth in the story makes her appealing. Her development is very original and becomes an entertaining character. The main villain Shogo Makishima was outstanding, he's very charismatic and his rivalry wit Kogami was a joy to watch. My main problem here was that we didn't get enough from the side characters, the enforcers in particular. For example Yaoyi and Kagari, although we were given glimpse of their backstories I didn't feel like it was enough especially since their backstories seemed interesting.\nFinal Verdict\nThe first season of Psycho Pass was great and interesting. It has thought provoking themes and a relatable story where society relies heavily on technology. However if the side characters were more fleshed out and the story was a lil more focused and not shroud in exposition, I feel this series could've been an all time great. My exact score for Psycho Pass is an 8.75 and I would recommend this for people who are into sci-fi and crime thrillers but due to its mature content I wouldn't recommend this to an immature or youth audience.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    Psycho-Pass is one of the most Westernized anime series I have seen in some time, and that makes it a pretty interesting addition to the modern anime canon. With its high maturity, mellowed stylistic content, constant mention of Western intellectual works, and strong mimicry of the American crime drama, Psycho-Pass seems as if it were to be a Western success by design. And to that end, it succeeds. Psycho-Pass is a good show and I recommend it, but it has its issues.\nThis review is pretty difficult for me to juggle. I've been watching quite a few series with pure intent to review them and, through\n          \n        this process, am refining my judgment. It's nearing the point where I need to decide what the difference between an '8' and '9' really is (or the difference between any two consecutive numbers really is), and that is an important duality that surfaces in every category of this review. Does abandoning the MAL format resolve this conflict? Probably not. In every series, a majority of the categories are important to how I value the work, though it can vary. The categories are good for the reader and I still have control over how much I decide to write on each topic. Well, I'll figure something out. Anyways, let's get into it.\n\n[Rating]\nStory: 8\nArt: 9\nSound: 8\nCharacter: 7 \nEnjoyment: 9\nOverall: 8\n\n[Story: 8]\nIts a psychological thriller in a which an investigation group is strung along on a series of crimes, with visions of stopping the bad guys. Generally, the plot is well constructed and has strong forward momentum in the latter half. Full of unexpected turns that keep the audience excited and on their feet.\nThe first 10ish episodes are a little dry, as the series takes time to grow into its final narrative form. It seems this kind of lull is necessary, as the more 'normal' behavior in the world serves as a contrast for the exciting back nine. I just would have like to see more come from these episodes. They seem disconnected and even now I would have wished to see more threads attaching them to the conclusion. This is especially true in a crime drama, where you would hope for an airtight plot where pure exposition can be used to further contextualize the threat. This sort of happens, but not beyond the point of Makashima having strong hacking ability.\nThere are also pretty major unresolved plot points. Yes, this series has a sequel. But the original plot is extremely self-contained and the general agreement is that the sequel doesn't properly continue what the original started. I just would've like to resolve the tension between the characters and explore the future of the Sibyl system. These dynamics are really at the core of the series, and it's a shame to see them left out of the conclusion.\n\n[Art: 9]\nThe art is generally good and never falters seriously. Like the characters and sound, the art style is generally pretty reserved. The animation goes for a realistic, muted look without many of the stylistic elements that anime diehards are used to, and with good reason. This is an American crime drama, and the art plays the part, fitting cohesively with the rest of the work. It definitely deserved praise for incorporating 3DCG properly, really only adding to the aesthetic quality of the work. The backgrounds are well drawn, the character portraits and action animation and pleasing, and the character designs are unique and interesting, but still very reserved. The series uses shadows fairly well. The violence is appropriately gruesome. It could be more punchy at times, but it usually performs. \nI would like to see slightly more detail in general, and much more detail on specific shots to accentuate the brutality of the violence. It's a small complaint that only exists in the back on my mind, but it's hard to give something like this a 10 when 'Your Name' exists, even if it performs to expectations.\n\n[Sound: 8]\nNothing noteworthy here. The score is mostly background but definitely, pushes the momentum of certain scenes. It performs like the score of a crime drama, it's just more modernized to stay in tune with the theme of the series. Sound effects are nice and loud. Voice acting is pretty reserved, which is both a boon and a hindrance. Sound doesn't stand out, but it is on purpose. It does its job pretty well.\nI never really felt connected to the classical music pieces that are connected to Makishima. They are connected with the constant mention of Western intellectual works, sure, but they feel off in connecting to our boy in white. I would imagine that the musical tastes that most aptly represent his philosophical perspective and role in the narrative would be something a little more 'animal-style'. Something not so founded in iron-cast construction.  Just a small complaint that rarely comes up.\n\n[Character: 7]\nThe characters are interesting. They are extremely reserved but often offer snapshots of their mental health. I'm only going to focus on my problems with the characters. Despite my criticisms, they fit very well with the crime drama standard and have the right amount of depth and dynamics. Just the series commits to a variety of errors, ranging for mild to serious, such as...\nDevelopment of a useless character. I found this strange. Yayoi gets a whole episode for development and backstory... and subsequently does nothing important for the rest of the series. She was never an important fixture in the plot and this kind of commitment just to make a background character stick out is bizarre.\nTelling, not showing. One of the better relationships in the show is that of Masaoka and Ginoza. It has a strong foundation and delicate dynamics that are generally played up... poorly and randomly. But the main issue is that the entirety of their relationship is told in dialogue. It makes it pretty difficult to connect to this particular character dynamic, which is a central issue for each of them.\n'Detective' backgrounders. Shion, Kagari, and Yayoi are generally not important. This isn't too serious an issue, and they have small development and little quirks. But the backgrounders feel extra lame in this series because they all have the same 'detective' personality. Characters without strong dynamics tend to get overshadowed by a sort of 'detective' trope. One of my big issues with the American crime drama as well.\nRandom character development. Akane is a good character, but she just becomes a strong detective and leader out of nowhere, without even really resolving to or reflecting on her situation.  That kind of change doesn't just happen. It could be a defining moment for the character but it falls flat.\nUnresolved dynamics. Need I say more?\nBlatant character mimicry. This is not really a problem in the series, but Kogami and Makishima are a blatant rip-off of Cowboy Bebop's Spike and Vicious. It kind of gets me miffed.\n\n[Enjoyment: 9]\nThe series is well paced after the first half, always has forward momentum, and gives the audience something to root for. The constant mention of Western intellectual works and their corresponding themes in the series give the audience a lot to think about and even outlets on how to explore this thought further. This is a bright spot for the series, especially as the series doesn't try to answer these questions like many lesser series do. There is an argument for each viewpoint and certain conditions make certain paths the best. Absolute moral truth is hard to come by, and this series embraces that.\n\n[Overall: 8]\nIt's a strong 8. I've talked about pretty much everything I wanted to talk about. The biggest issues are probably the first half of the story and the characters that just aren't given the space to shine.\n"},

But they introduced a quite unique and different concept of THE ENFORCERS, which added a true value to the anime in my view. \nThe anime also gives us a picture of the world handed over completely to the technology, which to some extent resembles to our world these days too in my opinion.\nPEOPLE feel more comfortable in online communities and sometime act as their own self or at least what they actually wanna be. It gives an idea of how things would be if human life would be handed\n          \n        over to the machines to decide their fate as the \"PSYCHO PASS\" status and the \"CRIME CO EFFICIENT\" in the anime decides whether the person should be found guilty or not.\nIt also decides their career paths, but the Shougo Makishima reminded them that the Humans have actually lost for what they exist. \"THE  TRUE HUMAN NATURE\", which makes them what they are.\nThe encounter with Shougo Makishima at least allowed the PSB to learn what is actually going on with the world they live in, which made it all interested.\nKouga as well as Makishima were those 2 persons who were destined to be rivals and their roles in the anime were designed quite brilliantly.\nThe anime was a real brilliant piece of work and didn't lose its pace till the end. The one thing that bothered me a bit that they might have spent 1 more episode on showing the relationship of Kouga with HIS \"DEAD Partner\". That might have done some more impact on making it more worthwhile.\nIn the end, it was still brilliant piece of work and worth watching....\n        "},

How can one determine what is right and what is wrong?\nA question that tests the laws of society in Psycho-Pass\nA society controlled by a machine sounds like a typical sort of theme that a dystopian novel has a deep basis on. This created society is said to control the actions of an individual, resulting in the lack of choice and will of the person themselves. Citizens believe that this is the perfect society and don't question the orders. What happens if someone objects?\nGenerally the Psycho-Pass is the measure of the soul of the individual. Their personalities are all quantitated\n          \n        and recorded. The psycho-pass ultimately is the mental states and possibility of an individual's desire to commit crimes. When stress levels go up, it clouds up someone's psycho-pass also. Is it right for them to be killed only because they have only thought about murdering someone and haven't committed it yet? Many people have thoughts about maybe committing crimes like these in our lives but they should have the choice of backing out of their plans. \nIn this society, once someone's Psycho-Pass goes beyond normal, they are immediately taken in to custody although they haven't even harmed a person yet. The Sybil System automatically calculates the risks of death and consequences if the individual is freely wandering around in this city. The stress levels among the individuals also is recorded by the Sybil System. Everything is controlled by this Sybil System through quantities. Once the quantities exceed the normal, the individuals are arrested and taken to therapy. The citizens, in this story, strongly believe it is the \"perfect\" system. As we move further in the story, the theme that often appears is whether it is even possible to have a perfect society.\nStory (7/10): Psycho-Pass is a great example of a utopia that ends up being set up the complete opposite. We have Tsunemori Akane, a new inspector, joining the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division. This is when she first meets the Enforcers or \"hunting dogs\" and they will work together to catch criminals and such. Although this anime provides a great theme, there is not too much development within the story. All of the events that does occur help build the characters up to their ultimate goal of catching the mysterious antagonist. The anime does not contain too much unpredictable events and doesn't completely hook the audience with interesting scenes.\nArt (7/10): The art is pretty well done. It is not too impressive but still manages to keep a slight modern taste although more recent animes may have better designs compared to Psycho-Pass. The characters were drawn pretty well. The designs would be a general anime type and doesn't exhibit much interesting details.\nSound (6/10): Psycho-Pass doesn't contain much soundtracks. There was not much memorable songs and OSTs that played throughout the anime. The first op and ed were not awful. The first op song kind of related to the idea of the society in Psycho-Pass. It is society that once they know of your thoughts, you could be sent to therapy or become a criminal just because of your own opinions. The second op and ed were slightly worse although I personally like the second ending. The voice acting was set up pretty well done.\nCharacter (8/10): Although I didn't like the MC in the beginning. She has shown to me that she is changeable. Her changes throughout the anime was developed though many events that has thrown her on a emotional rollercoaster. She does question the ways of how Sybil works and that was a big development however she does nothing to overthrow it when she had the chance. In general, she represents a normal human being also. If someone says they are going to shoot, it is harder to do then say. It is understandable how she couldn't shoot the antagonist of the story although she had many chances to do so. \nAlong with the MC is the Enforcer, Shinya Kogami. He does show a big development throughout the story but it wasn't for the best. He is extremely observant and smart. He starts out with his morals warped until Akane is able to remind him why he is in this line of work. Throughout the story, he sticks with the MC but has a special grudge against the antagonist. \nThe main antagonist of the story is brilliant. He is like Kogami, extremely smart and observant. Kogami and the antagonist share many qualities and very alike. He is an anarchist that can easily manipulate people. He also has a tendency of quoting from famous literatures. Not only is he smart, he is also physically strong. \nEnjoyment (8/10): The anime provides very well done scenes. There was character development however the MC was still not too confident and a little annoying sometimes. The anime was thrilling with intense action scenes and a great story for each case. All of the events do lead up to the antagonist, who is the most interesting character in the show in my opinion. \nOverall (8/10): Although this anime has some flaws, I enjoyed how this anime was trying to provide a general theme to everyone. A perfect utopia such as this world does not exist and never will. The whole purpose of this type of world was for everyone to be happy. What happens if you become a criminal and can never be back to normal ever again? That doesn't make me happy for sure. The anime also provided some neat action scenes that was pretty okay to my enjoyment level. I thought that the development with the MC was very needed because I forced myself to watch psycho-pass the first time and didn't make it through the first episode just because I didn't like the MC. The antagonist of series is the one I was very intrigued by. He is very enjoyable character with many of his interesting scenes and his ability to manipulate people to play for him even though it is dangerous. I pretty much enjoyed the show although I wouldn't say it is the best anime I have ever watched. Psycho-Pass challenges the utopia set up that is not very perfect at all.\n        "},

If you are looking for that kind of anime, this isn’t a place for you. If you like thinking about philosophical things like life, the meaning of life, what is wrong or right etc., welcome my friend because you have come to the right place. \nThere is utopian world– which is really dystopian- where it gives a system calls Sibyl. Sibyl controls what the person will do and measures if this person is dangerous to humanity or a normal citizen. It seems like it’s an average\n          \n        plot but it is more philosophical. If we look at the philosophical side of the anime, the main concept is a person’s ability to think and what makes a person, human. If a person can’t think or act like what the person wants then can we say that that person has any different than a farm animal? If there is a system which thinks for you, then people will accept it but then does it make you a human?  Isn’t the ability to think makes a human, human?  And the fact that they don’t know what the system based on, how it measures you is basically unknown but the people thrust it anyway because they think that the system is something superior, a high power that knows everything and can do anything (but in the end it is not). And it is really easy to control people who don’t think or obey you for any cause because they don’t know better. So you can control everyone and bring order. But is it worth to bring order, in order to make people unthinkable creatures that will obey only? And I really enjoy thinking and trying to answer my questions and relate to the characters and what will I do, if I were them. \nThe pacing of the anime was slow. You can’t finish 21 episodes in one go. I mean, you can but then you will be bored and feel like your mind is exploding. This anime has a really heavy concept and because of it really heavy pace. But I really enjoy watching this anime at the end. Just don’t binge watch this anime. \nAbout the characters, there are two characters that developed really well. Kougami and Makishima. Their ways of thinking and the belief they had etc. was really good developed. They really make you think and question Sibyl and not only Sibyl, the real life also. At least they got me thinking about more philosophical things in my life. Kind of eye opener to me. Akane was OK I guess. At the beginning she couldn’t think of herself because of the Sibyl and everything but in the end, she started to question and she started to have thought on her own so I guess she developed really well too. At least that was the producer’s intention. But Kougami and Makishima were in the spotlight. The other characters were just there to be there. The producers made them a little bit unimportant and disposable characters. I wish I saw them a little bit more or at least the relationship between them or their past and the way they think. I mean two of the gang died but it was like “Well they died/disappeared… Anyway, where were we?” And I really wish that they had a little bit more caring than this. \nBut overall, it was a good anime if you want to think about the anime afterward and just want to experience heavy subject, you can watch this anime.

This will be a rather long review, so if you really are looking for a short and quick review, this isn't one.\nWell then, those still around, here are my ratings:\nStory 9/10\nI enjoyed the story and how it turned out. It boosted my enjoyment of this show through and through because the story relentlessly pushed me\n          \n        to my limit of mind  blows and plot twists, and yet somehow didn't run out of energy by the end of the anime, to be honest, I think the ending was better than the beginning, despite the fact that the story was extremely fast-paced, much more than any other anime I've seen. I give it a 9 though, and not a 10, because while the story was fast-paced and relentlessly energetic, it had some twists and turns I thought weren't necessary. The anime also had some parts where it seemed to be more or less bland.\nArt 9/10\nI enjoyed the art that was depicted within the show, it surpassed what anyone's standards should be. I enjoyed the animations thoroughly, and a lot of the scenes put me on the edge of my seat because I felt I was there. I give a 9 for the mere fact that the art had seemed to be a tad on the darker side, meaning the colors selected were more dark and gloomy than bright (I understand that was on purpose, but there were various points in the show that the colors were actually brighter than usual, so I had to give it a 9 out of 10)\nSound 10/10\nThe soundtrack was outstanding, I was on the edge of the seat at the right times, I was shedding manly tears at the times it was sad, and I was feeling like wanting to do something at the times it was moving. All of these were contributed by nothing more than the music, which was so well placed within the anime. The times when something was intense, music was intense, when it was sad, music was sad, etc. The voice actors and actresses were all superb and played their roles quite well. Plus, as a bonus, Egoist is the band that plays ending song (It was awesome enough to be played through the entire anime, not just the first or second half). I can't demand anymore of the  audio when it has done its job and more.\nCharacter 8/10\nI loved the characters for not only their initial impressions of them to me, but their developments as well. I think this anime did a superb job at explaining the background of most of the characters, and I felt as though I was standing next to a live person throughout the anime. I have to give the characters an 8 though, because they weren't all developed and given a history, even though some didn't need to have one. I disliked that some of the characters had too similar personalities as well. Although it was interesting to see two characters who opposed each other, and stood for different reasons, yet had personalities of similar traits, very clever.\nEnjoyment 10/10\nAs I had said before, this anime put me on the edge of the seat, not once did I feel as though the anime was going down a slope towards \"a turn for worse\" (or \"School  Days\" level, if you will). All of the times where an emotion was conveyed (even those I mentioned earlier I thought were unnecessary) were logical and made sense. I enjoyed this anime a lot, so it deserves its spot in my top 5 and the 10 out of 10.\nOverall 9/10\nThis anime was, in no way bad. I enjoyed it from start to finish, and it was one of the few anime that grasped my pure enjoyment from the very start. I won't say it's the best because it did have some parts towards the end that probably responded to fan service.... I liked how the anime had ended, about 95% satisfactory. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys mystery, action, drama, and mind blows.  \n        "},

Firstly, i must say that it had exceed what i had expected it to be and in my opinion is better than guilty crown. The story tends to include literature in it and always starts out average but as the episode continues, it gets very captivating. If you are a person who wants to see a great\n          \n        climax in every episode this anime might just do that for you. Also, if you enjoyed the artwork and music in guilty crown, i definitely recommend this anime as the artwork's amazing and the music is relatively nice(especially if you are a fan of Egoist)\nAlthough there can be room for improvement for the development of the characters, but overall the fast pace of the anime covers up for this flaw. i would compare this anime to animes like mirrai nikki, guilty crown and death note.\nLastly, i would give this anime an overall of a 10 mainly because of the fact that this genre of anime excites me during every episode. However, i must say that some of you might get disappointed at the end as the ending is quite an open way to end any story and many of you might feel that the story should continue. This anime rarely shows signs of romance so the parts that tends to captivate are mainly the plot and success in being able to bring the viewers through a rolle coaster ride through every episode.\n        "},

It's simply a masterpiece in my eye, and doesn't mess around with shitty clichès nor stereotypes; it's a straight sci-fi/cyberpunk story that's executed really good.\nArt (9/10): While the initial episodes had very good art (and also through the whole series), the qualty was somewhat lower in some scenes/episodes and that's the only drawback hero. While much CGI was used I didn't mind it all - it actually fits this kind of story if done right.\nSound (9/10): Psycho Pass has a great soundtrack, and two great OP's too! I\n          \n        actually watched the intros for a change so big ++ here. I think the main theme got a little overused for the last episodes, it was like they just decided too press play on the music when they thought \"hey the climax is approaching\". While that is just fine they should really cut it or mix it different atleast sometimes.\nCharacter (10/10): While I've seen characters similiar in design to Makishima they really managed to picture him as a solid antagonist and idealist. He doesn't really have that much of development through the story but as his ideology is slowly revealed it makes you ask yourself what really is right and wrong, and question the legitimity of the Sibyl System. Akane didn't really appeal as protagonist in the beginning but also changed very much through the various crime cases, becoming a full-fledged detective. Kogami - definition of baddass that like Makishima didn't develop alot during the series but instead alot of his past was revealed thus making his intentions reasonable.\nEnjoyment (10/10): Not only is the story and the action good, but it also makes you think and reason alot during the series. This is a good thing that piques interest because it's well done.\nHighly recommended.\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    This is my first anime review, so please bear with me if I make any mistakes.\nStory: 8\nThe story behind Psycho-Pass was, all-in-all, very well done. The creators have created the series in a way that makes the viewer feel like you are viewing the events from many different viewpoints. Instead of sticking to the life of the main, female protagonist, the story offers short windows into the lives of many other characters, which serves to really tie the entire story together. These little pieces of backstory eventually come into play in the main scenario, shaping the ways in which many characters act and react to\n          \n        the unstable world around them. There were some questions left unanswered, however, but the creators still did a great job of making a cohesive, interesting story. \nArt: 7\nThe art was pretty average in this anime. Like many other series, Psycho-Pass constantly emanates a somber, dark atmosphere from its art, which is reflective of the futuristic, police-controlled state that it depicts. This style became a bit boring after a while, however, despite the obvious tie to the conditions of the story's setting.\nSound: 8\nAll-in-all, the creators of Psycho-Pass did a good job on the audio aspects of the series. First of all, both intros were great choices for this particular show. I saw in them a tone of oppression and darkness, which is reflective, once again, of the society that the story attempts to portray. In a similar way, both of the outros tie the episodes together very well. The audio used within the episodes themselves was pretty average. It allowed for relative immersion in the show, but it was nothing out of the ordinary.\nCharacter: 8\nThe characters were an integral part of this series in particular. Though the creators failed to adequately describe and make several characters important in the eyes of the viewers, the many characters that they did develop were multi-dimensional, interesting, and, most importantly, unique. From the fallen agent who seeks nothing but revenge to the seasoned veteran balancing work and family, and from the novice learning the ropes to the evil mastermind out to destroy in imperfect society, each of these characters is different. This was one of the main reasons why I enjoyed the series.\nEnjoyment: 8\nThere are a few elements that I definitely enjoyed in this show. Firstly, as has been previously stated, the characters were very diverse and interesting. Secondly, I really liked the use of gore in the narrative. The creators of Psycho-Pass did not use gore for gore's sake. Instead, they used it in order to allow the readers to react emotionally to the material present and to convey the horrible, gruesome nature of many antagonists in the show. The use of gore was pretty average in its amount, but it was used very well. One aspect of the show that I did not like, however, was its pacing. I felt like the first half was incredibly slow, with the different arcs seeming almost pointless, while the second half was a metaphorical sprint through the rest of the material. Granted, the fast-paced action was a welcome respite from the slow pace the show had originally utilized, but this was still a bit annoying.\nOverall: 10\nThe show does have a few faults. Its pacing is a bit uneven, some characters never achieve relevancy, and so on. The good outweighs the bad, however. Psycho-Pass offers a compelling detective story that establishes many emotional bonds along the way only to put them to the test in the most critical of moments. I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and exciting story about a group of characters with their own motives and their own means of achieving them.\n        "},

Sadly, the side characters aren't as memorable. \nSound: (14/15) Really well done soundtrack, good openings and a great use of techno. \nAnimation: (13/15) Nicely done, good fight scenes, very fluid, but bad character designs. \nOverall: (89/100)\nI really enjoyed Psycho Pass (from now on it'll be called PP), mainly because it reminded me of all the good things about\n          \n        a couple of movies I saw this year. The plot of PP reminds me a lot of Minority Report and Equilibrium. The similarities between the shows are that each one has a set system in place that strives to become a crimeless utopia of sorts, but they aren't without limitations. Also, all three take place in a futuristic setting, and PP in particular has a pretty original setting. Of the three I felt PP has the most believable story, as the others revolve around seeing the future and taking away emotions (not very likely). The show explains the pros and cons of having this kind of system in place, and expands upon that. It doesn't tell you whether a system that limits human freedom but basically stops crime is right or wrong, and leaves these thoughts to you. I like it when a series doesn't force their opinions down my throat yet still makes me thing about the story at hand. One downside is that this kind of story isn't 100% original, as there are tons of similarities with other shows (not just the two I mentioned). The show also likes to quote famous works of literature, which to me makes it sound like it's trying too hard to be smart. (33/35)\nThe characters in PP aren't all that interesting. When I first seen the cast I immediately thought Cowboy Bebop for some of the characters. That would be a good thing, but these characters lack the charisma of the Bebop crew. None of the characters are particularly interesting aside from maybe Kogami. The problem is these characters aren't very interesting. Some crime shows counter this by making them more laid back, but of they are too laid back that can also be a problem (they are saving lives after all).  On the bright side, the show has a great antagonist in the form of Makishima Shougo, and Kogami is also very cool. One character I had a problem with for majority of the series is Akane, who didn't seem right for this job at all. Thankfully, she got some great character development by the end and was a real treat to watch in the final episodes. (29/35)\nThe production values for this show are generally favorable. The score is very good, particularly both opening songs. The tracks fit each scene great, with some having your normal music, while others having some good techno music (really fitting with the sci fi elements). (14/15) The fights are very nicely choreographed, and the animation is very fluid.  Sadly, the character designs are a big let down, and can be really annoying in the first part of the show. (13/15)\nThis was one great show, and one of my favorites from 2012 (of what I have seen so far). The show excelled in pretty much every category, except in the cast and character designs department. This is one 2012 show you don't want to miss. (89/100)\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Psycho-Pass doesn't give a particularly good first impression. The first episode too unsubtly portrays the Sibyl System as incompetent, making it seem like a shallow examination of its subject matter. On top of that, the premise itself seems like a ripoff of Minority Report.\nAnd as it turns out, it actually does end up going over a lot of the same concepts and story turns as Minority Report. But it does have some ideas that don't come from there. In fact it seems to be focused on different things altogether. For a lot of the series it's more about criminal investigations than weighing the merits of\n          \n        a mechanical system making decisions about our lives. \nIn all honesty, it handles that pretty well. It's extremely dark, like the creators decided to only portray the most disturbing crimes they could come up with, but it's actually mature about it and ultimately it works out for the series. The characters are engaging and come across as pretty human, at least the main characters, though they are working from archetypes. Both sides come off as clever, and it gives the series a sort of Death-Note style battle of wits type of appeal, with similar amounts of dramatic irony and an equally similar total lack of mystery surronding the killers' identities. And like in Death Note, it ends up being entertaining if a bit over-the-top.\nSome of the places the story goes are a little questionable and it definitely comes across as pretentious. It can be tiring to watch all the scenes of characters sitting around smugly dicussing literature and philosophy. Its allusions are mostly relevant and well understood, which mitigates that issue, but it's still there. Many of the ideas presented by the story, whether borrowed from old sci-fi movies or otherwise, are honestly thought provoking, which is also nice.\nSo to try and summarize this meandering analysis of the show, Psycho-Pass, while definitely a little overhyped, is ultimately pretty good and you could definitely do worse when choosing an anime to watch.\n        "},

INTENSE. this anime made my\n          \n        heart beats faster at one time, sad, nervous, and even crying at other times. the setup was quite dark but i gotta say it's brilliant. warning alert for those who doesn't stand brutality and sadism, but i guarantee it's not just pure brutality. as a matter of fact all those were really important in building the whole story.\n(9) for the art. i love the uniqueness of the whole concept, i love the twists and how everything went far from my expectation but managed to draw my awe. \n(7) for the sound. good. nothing reminds me of the sound in particular though. but i'll say the sounding was enough to build the mood. \n(9) for the character. i really love how the characters stick to their personalities. how they evolve, become stronger and everything without loosing their main identity. as a matter of fact i love almost every characters in this anime, main characters (akane tsunemori & kogami), the friends, the reinforcements (kagari & ginoza), and especially the bad guys (i really love makishima XD). i'd say even the supporting characters have consistently great personalities \n(9) in overall. i'd say i had great time watching this anime. this is not actually the type of genre i would watch, but now i'm kinda looking for this kind of anime again XD, Thanks for changing my mindset ^^"},

It is perfectly dark blend of crime, political corruption, philosophical debate, action, and suspense. The story itself brings together all these elements in an extremely intelligent and complex way to create a world that pushes its characters to extremes, allowing the audience to brutally investigate the worst parts of human nature--parts that often manifest within ourselves. Furthermore, the story world that Psycho Pass creates is incredibly realistic and is very true to the parameters it lays down at the outset of the series. Unlike other animes where deus ex machinas consistently make frequent (and cringe\n          \n        worthy) appearances, there is no instance in which the 'rules' of the society Psycho Pass creates is contradicted. It is an unforgiving world in which the actions of the characters are permanent and fatal. \nWhile the Psycho Pass' setting could very well carry the story on its own merit, what really makes the series so good is the cast of characters. Each character is created with such detail and depth, it's hard to dislike even the most corrupt of them. Not only are the characters extremely interesting in themselves but their interaction with each other are meticulously thought out and no piece of dialogue is without significant meaning. I could get into further detail on this but you would be reading forever and ever amen.\nDo not expect to get a laugh out of this show. It is very dark, disturbing, and graphic. This show is not for the faint of heart but, if you can stomach the gore, the show is worth your every second. Very few other series provide a comparable level of depth and design on par with Psycho Pass. I highly, highly recommend this show.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    To say the honest truth, I haven't seen GITS so I probably can't compare it to Psycho Pass. But WOW what an anime. The plot detail was so elaborate an handled so beautifully that I fail to see why it's critisised for stealing the thunder of GITS. However,  I can understand why people may say that as it has a similar conspiracy plot involving a futuristic world ruled by robots. But that's not to say that it isn't good. All the characters and plot twists keep the viewer on the edge of their seat as this cyberpunk masterpiece finds even more inventive ways to\n          \n        keep you entertained. \nHowever, that's not to say there are'nt downsides. Like every anime, this one is by no means perfect. Although the characters are relatable and the plot riveting, I couldn't help but feel that something is missing. During some episodes, I felt as if there could have been something more to cure my boredom. This changed very quickly though, and Im hardly saying it's fair to judge it by those few lacking aspects. But it is still by no means perfect. Whilst I enjoyed some aspects that others didn't, (mainly the excessive brutality) there were some that were just plain random. To be honest though, that's probably just my personal opinion and others shouldn't judge it because I did.\nOn the contrary, I didn't realise how dear this anime was to me untill it ended. The greatest aspect (IMO) was the main antagonist, Shougo Makishima. In these mundane sequences that didn't excite me, it was the promise that a truly great villain would make all the difference. This was the very same reason why most of Sherlock season 3 was dissappointing for me. IMO, Makishima is among the greatest anime antagonists of all time just because of his sheer charisma. And that is what makes him SCARY.\nAnyway, that was my opinion of the anime and I hope that you agree\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    There's a lot of interesting things on the surface of Psycho-Pass. As a sci-fi defined by its high-concept universe - one determined by a system that judges everyone, from which is the true path of someone life to one's immediate propensity to commit a crime -, there's a lot of (so-so) philosophizing. I call it \"surface\" because there's a very particular use of philosophy during the series, that doesn't actually involve engaging with concepts, or any more strict philosophical discourse. The most interesting one is philosophy-as-a-weapon, the most prominent example when Kogami and Makishima first find each other: a quote of Descartes is rebutted by\n          \n        a quote from Pascal, as if it was a rhetorical checkmate - and the characters acknowledge this, that this is only to prove each others' intelligence and erudition. This is mostly textual, something that happens through dialogue. The useful bibliographic philosophy for the series is mostly missed (there's a fitting Foucault by the end, and a name-dropped Bentham - but still only as a sign of book-smartness).\nThe deeper philosophy is another: there's a very strong question of bio-politics regarding the Sybil System (Foucault's Panopticon, as cited in the series, where people live in a state of constant vigilance). There's a really interesting existential consideration (somewhat-) proposed by the series that derives from a life determined by this system: there's no existential crisis when your life is chosen for you, no place for ennui, to question your purpose (as it is told to you); but, once the Sybil System is fatally questioned, this is the nature of the questions that come forth (as usual in japanese media, they are always bubbling under). And the most important one: the Sybil System is utilitarianism incarnated (there's even literal calculation as the justification for a particular death), and, as such, it decides on what is best for most, which - as the classic critique goes - is not really what's best for each particular member living in this estate. This is at the center of Kogami and Makishima rivalry.\nIt's a bold choice to make the Enforcer's the protagonists for this reason. They're the ones maintaining this controlling, ufanist (the series' Japan is closed to the rest of the world) state. Makishima has to be made an extremist, a psychopath, an (\"the bad kind of\") anarchist to register as a bad guy - because, once he makes his points, they're actually pretty valid (using this system for peace has achieved a civilizatory tranquility, a \"personal serenity\", but has sacrificed the human identity, autonomy, spirit -- there's existential humanism at the root of his philosophy, even if not in his ethics). The series balances this by making the Enforcer's pretty well defined characters, with enough of a dangerous edge to keep them on the fringe of the system and, therefore, in a gray-scale morality. And, even more, this ambiguity is not lost on the series but is by design. This is the most important, since the Crime Coefficient is what dictates the action of a character, and the series uses it to trace how they behave themselves - how it gets corrupted and turns them to a latent criminal, making, for instance, Kogami's morality now black and white and, as such, his actions now a personal vendetta rather than the sense of justice that once moved him. It shows how personal the relationships get. \nAlthough the series greatest conflict is between Kogami and Makishima, the arc that sustains the series is Akane's. She's the main character, and we follow how she grows into a competent detective and as a person - but, most of all, how she learns about the truth of this world and actually survives. Her incapacity to do something about it is frustrating, but her decision to revolt against it also the biggest victory. She goes full on Camus, one of the more optimists brands of existentialism. She embraces the deeper shades of gray, which is a bittersweet triumph. \nMy favorite thing about Psycho-Pass, though, is that - underneath this serious, dark, \"philosophical\" tone - the series is a really great piece of genre fiction. More than a sci-fi (everything commented above), the anime is an economic, straight forward action/detective story with very little fat, that takes its concept seriously and derives its conflicts from an exploration of such concept. This is good writing. The episodes fly by, and they are FUN. I don't need much more.\nLoose thoughts:\n- Saiga lives in a replica of Frank Lloyd Wright's Falling Water. Which I guess is in Japan now.\n- (Spoiler) Sybil System is actually what the Matrix was going to be (using brains as computers). It's an interesting subversion making these brains be of the people who cannot be measured by the system: people outside the norm being used to imposed a standard of normality on the rest of the population.\n- Is Kogami reading Swann's Way because his looking for his lost time? For fuck's sake.\n- There's a lot in common with Cowboy Bebop, from aesthetical similarities to the genre structure. The fights, and even the design of Kogami and Makishima, make it seem like Cowboy Bebop (Spike and Vicious) was a clear point of reference. I mean this well.\n- Makishima and Kogami's showdown at night, in the wheat fields, is just the best. Amazing animation, beautiful cuts. Greatest scene in the whole series.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    As a kid my favorite type of TV shows and books were ones that gave the viewer a challenge and forced them to think outside the box to solve the mystery... Psycho-Pass was that but if a literature guru got to direct it all. The anime was so god damn good and forced me to be thinking and paying attention to every thing they said. Trying to figure out the secrets behind the government and Makishima was one the most enjoyable things I've done in a long time. I haven't had so much fun watching an anime in a long time.\nWhere do I even begin...\n          \n        The plot was AMAZING it wasn't just a generic trying to find out who the murderer is anime, it had much more depth to it than that, the villain wasn't just considered evil because they say they're evil, I could often finding myself seeing stuff from Makishima's point of view and questioning who's the real villain in this anime. Without going into any spoilers, as more things are revealed you start to think to yourself that maybe Makishima isn't necessarily wrong and that maybe there's some method in his madness. The entire anime is filled with literature and can be a little hard to understand what they're referencing and what some of the quotes they're citing mean, making this anime targeted for a more mature audience, however even if you don't fully get all the quotes I really don't think it'll make the anime not worth watching. The plot and the amazing artwork is enough to keep you hooked even if you don't fully understand the quotes. However I do think it'll enhance your enjoyment if you know a little bit about literature. \nGod the art is beautiful, it's not like that typical vibrant and fantasy art style anime's typically go for, it's more of a realistic and dark style of anime. God is it beautiful, they paid so much attention to detail and you can tell what's happening in every scene. The openings have some of the best artwork I've seen in a long time.  They all follow a consistent pattern, for example in OP 1 the consistency is the color pink, by pink i mean the color pink transitions you into other scenes. The reason it catches your eye every time is because with the darker style of art they're doing a vibrant color like pink really stands out. This is one of the best transition methods I've seen in anime so AMAZING job to the director and the animators who worked on it.\nAt this point I shouldn't even have to say Psycho-Pass is worth watching, everything about this anime is just amazing. The plot is the most interesting and enjoyable thing I've watched in a long time. The artwork is breathtaking and not something you see too often. Even the characters are all interesting and likable in their own ways. And even though allot of people give it hate, Season 2 wasn't even that bad... Nothing compared to the first season but i'll go into that more on my Season 2 review...\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    This may seem more of a Critique than a Review actually. I will be focusing on Sibyl the most...Since it may be something worth everybody’s time.\nSibyl:\n We could rate Sibyl’s manifestation as one of the best episodes (17, 20, 22)…..\nAnd Sibyl is:\n-Asymptomatic irregularities\n-An amalgam of immoralities which we expect to be Just! (As these so called ethics forgotten by this generation of ours are being once again revived by the THEWIRED, cannot be a simple description of specific objects)\n-A Monster rampaging the World ( I feel the ending Monster without a name was made to mock Sibyl..)\n-Impartiality may be the only cause of its success…\n          \n\nSibyl’s Incompleteness:\nSibyl itself was incomplete as it was searching for new conception of the World all of the time…\nA failure at that… However transcendentalism may not be a very good option either… Since a system such as Sibyl could crumble;\n Reasons:\n-I believe that reasoning cannot provide that much into justice (to an extent, it has limits)\n-If these conceptions of justice are ranked by acceptability then it creates a good chance of the territorial invasion or such matters of strife.\n-They do not have a capacity for good or a sense of justice..( This has been mentioned at the end of the show in Akane’s words “People are meant to protect the Law. People have always detested evil and sought out a righteous way of living. Their feelings – the accumulation of those peoples feelings –are the law.”   If we accept this to be true then the Sibyl’s existence has no meaning but to rule the world from the shadows. It ain’t too fun in Makishima’s conception of the World…\nThe Sibyl itself is a vast variety of instances such that the ideology and the dogma may emerge from somewhat different than the culture, custom or religion itself. Considering Passion to be stronger than any type of reasoning(consented by both Makishima and Akane). Spontaneous responses and the new psychology that builds up every time may be very well a risky situation.\n\nStory: Looking deep inside ourselves, facing the Monsters inside us, carrying out acts of brutality as self defense, caging these beasts and taming them to avoid immediate possibility of injury. \n9/10 for Latent Criminals theme…… Overall 7/10\nCharacters:\nMakishima: Due to Human reflection achieved by reason and emotion in his own words “Man shows his true nature when confronted with fear. His true nature shows.” As of this he seems much amorphous.\n “I love this game people call life from the bottom of my heart.” But I do not respect it, weird kinda love bro, weird kinda heart. \nAkane: She was the best character I find in the show… She kept it simple, sane and high a very very admirable kind of person. Her actions were derived by the reason and sentiment found in the moral conclusion she made. \n-Dialogues are off the roof\nKougami: A perfect example of badly reasoned certitude… Bt then again “You need to look through their eyes to understand”\n\nSound:  One of the Best…. It much more energetic the kind I don’t usually like but it settles well with the Action scenes …..7/10\nAnimation: I don’t usually care for animation but good job with animation... I felt there were times when the animation and sound were off bt still very Good…  7/10\nBest Lines: “Are you afraid of dying even after you gain perception of a god?”-Makishima again….\nOpening:\n “The opposite of love is not hatred but indifference.”\nI believe this statement made by Shougo Makishima shows how cheeky this kid actually is xD…..Anyhow it shows his solitude mentioned again in the last epsidoes…His nonchalance made him do such horrible tasks? I hard it find to believe that he had any sense of justice or fairness to begin with. It only seems sad at the end that he was too weak to accept anything but Kogami (that too when he was hanging around with a gun)… A perfect example of stray wits… A misery and more miserable moments to pay again and again… However most would find it hard to dislike him…\nA very complex and intricate opening which let us into things in an instance 9/10.\nEnding:  Season1 Good….\n( The review is based upon Season1 only…. Season2 I have to watch it first xD)\nWould like to hear your opinions on it  "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This anime is brilliant! Psycho-Pass is a very smart series that deeply analizes freewill and whether or not a person's \"hue\", when cloudy, can determine if they will become a threat to society. Using a special weapon known as \"The Dominator\", detectives are able to continuously read and send psychological data to determine a persons crime coefficient. Depending on how clouded a persons \"hue\" is, they will either receive mandatory rehabilitation, or an execution on the spot.\nAt first I was not going to give this anime a chance, but I am thrilled I did! I love the dark, mysterious, and serious atmosphere of this anime.\n          \n        Additionally, the logical questions postulated regarding aspects of freewill and whether or not a person can be judged before they commit a crime were magnificent! Furthermore, every character added a significant element that made them both likable and unforgettable. Finally, the animation was beautiful, and the music significantly heightened every situation. In many ways I would say this series is already comparable to a series like \"Cowboy Bebop\".\nIn short, Psycho-Pass is a juicy sophisticated anime that will appeal to many mystery/sci-fi fans. It is animated craftsmanship and definitely worth the watch.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    Hey folks this review is for Psycho-Pass. Some may be surprised by the seven that I have given the show as a whole. Then again some may not, there are people rating it at a 5 in popular reviews. I want to specify first that this anime isn't bad, it is indeed deserving of your attention. I however hate anime drama, somehow it always manages to seem illogical or forced. Psycho-Pass isn't different. The show lines up a solid story, a solid background and then dilutes itself and its characters in a forced vein of the righteous logic that causes the anime to lose a\n          \n        few points. \nLets start with the story overview. We start off with a new detective joining the group. Since shes knew she is given knowledge which begins to build the world around the viewer. A sort of totalitarian environment is in place where most of life is automated, or has some for of technological improvement. Unfortunately crimes are still committed and this is where we need these detectives and their enforcers. Enforcers are people who are judged to be irredeemable criminals so they are given the task of apprehending the bad guys so as the detectives don't become emotionally unstable. They can tell peoples ability, their likelihood of committing crimes and even emotion states by doing scans. Detectives are upstanding citizens, and apprehending criminals sometimes affect their scores and that's why they use enforcers. Now we know the basics, we then learn more about the lives of the citizens and the world around them. We don't know so much as to have a solid understanding of the world completely but enough that any viewer should be able to follow the story without any issues. \nThe story really begins to unfold about 7 episodes in when we learn about a particular person and that they have a correlation with the modern criminal acts that our detectives are trying to solve. This character goes on to spice up the next 9 or so episodes. Of course it does take the rest of the show to come to some conclusion but its really the ending of this anime that begins to deteriorate the work the beginning did to make this a decent show.\nI cant go further into the story without spoilers so we will discuss some of the characters here. This show doesn't have an abundant cast. We mainly focus on the detective unit and the enforcers that work for the detectives which is about 6 characters or so. The most interesting characters would be our female lead(Akane Tsunemori) and our male lead(Shinya Kougami). Now I use the term interesting lightly when it comes to Akane. I don't have a problem with female leads, but she is the biggest reason to dislike the show IMO. Some anime make wonder if they purposefully are using an obnoxious character trait to either engage the viewer in a positive or negative way or if the writer truly feels that specific way and is writing their ideals. Either way Akane leaves a bad impression. The first episode made me say out loud \"I hope she changes because she just pissed me off\". Luckily for us she doesn't change but instead receives little in the way of screen time until later in the anime. She is a genius who fits perfectly into this society though she does have her own problems like, she had so many job offers she stresses out about which one to choose. She also tries to embody justice, and truly wants to help people. However she doesn't have many chances to explore her depth and when she does have a chance she makes several decisions that truly just blow me away. The last few episodes she undergoes a complete character change, though her ideals don't really change so she just becomes a more pronounced annoyance. I will say that people who agree with my synopsis of Akane will be mildly pleased with the ending.\nShinya is the cool powerful enforcer who is supposed to be the other side of justice that Akane is not. This is the side I can agree with more and luckily he received more screen time. He is consistent through the series though his willingness to quietly go along with Akane is rather unusual. He gives off the air of the lone wolf bad ass but he is only a man, he gets injured plenty of times, he listens to his superiors and doesn't do anything that would make you question why his behavior is being tolerated which also was a mark of the good writing that Psycho-Pass has.\nThe other characters are not amazing the other two I would consider interesting would be the other inspector Ginoza and the enforcer Tomomi. Unfortunately going into these characters would spoil the first half of the story. The other characters though given adequate time didn't stick out very much and though I'm interested in them, don't fault the writers for not giving more detail into them.\nThe art and sound were both well done. The soundtrack was enjoyable though nothing I will listen to. The art was pretty and fluid. \nI enjoyed the show though I am disappointed it had the DeathNote syndrome. Which was a great start that just turns into a pile of crap towards the end. The characters were interesting and even the annoying ones didn't seem to weigh heavy on the viewing experience. Some may disagree with these views and that's fine, but the \"Justice\" dilemma is hard to overlook if you disagree with the views of \"good\" characters like Akane. \nTLDR: If you haven't watch this, then watch it. You may dislike the end or some of the things in it but you may also love it. Ultimately either way this anime deserves to be seen. Solid characters, solid story, great art.\n        "},

Maybe that goes for any show...but anyways I got very attached to almost all the lead cast through these awesome 22 episodes.\nEnjoyment-10\n---------------------\nThis show was so good and made me so excited to watch every single week waiting to see how certain story lines would tie up all the way to the amazing ending. \nOverall-9\n---------------\nI can't really think of anyways to improve this almost 10 anime. I just don't feel a 10 is right here, but it is so close. For me when I have a 10 anime I'll know it and I'll hold out till then. For Psycho-Pass though it'll always be a favorite of mine.\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Psycho-Pass is a very intelligent anime that requires the viewers full attention in order for one to fully understand its themes and characters. In fact the series is quite reminiscent of many classic literature pieces about society, government, and technology. Hell a lot of the literature that influences the show is mentioned in conversations between characters. \nStory 9/10\nThe story of Psycho-Pass is really something you have to view to understand. The atmosphere of a futuristic Japan where technology basically dictates everyone's life is very well done and its flaws are also well portrayed. Honestly, I don't really want to go into too much depth, because\n          \n        it would be much better if you just watched it. There are a few slow episodes but they're used to develop the characters and I personally found the ending to be somewhat flawed and a bit cliche. Nevertheless, Psycho-Pass is a very thought out and well-written series that I would consider one of anime-literature quality. \nArt 10/10\nNot much to say here the art is really nice by my standards. The city and atmosphere is appropriately melancholic and emotionless, echoing many of the themes of the series. The combination of the excellent art and the soundtrack make for some rare but appreciable badass moments\nSound 10/10\nAs I already mentioned, the soundtrack is very good at setting the appropriate tones for every scene. Every piece of the soundtrack is also very suitable to the futuristic and depressing but hopeful setting of the story.\nCharacter 10/10 \nPsycho-Pass has a very strong cast of characters who might seem cliche at first, but the writing takes every opportunity to develop each character to a point of realism. Each character is faced with their own personal beliefs in a flawed society that only they can see as the law enforcement of the city. Every character follows his own motives and beliefs strongly as they are faced with realistic situations that require difficult decisions.\nEnjoyment 9/10\nTake heed to my next few words. Psycho-Pass is not a sentimental and cheery anime. It is appropriately dark, brooding and realistic. To truly appreciate the series for what it is, you have to think while watching. It is a no nonsense type of series, every bit of dialog and situation is important to the whole of the series and really needs to be understood for the Psycho-Pass to be enjoyed. As I said, its like a piece of anime literature. \nOverall 9/10\nThis is probably one of the best series I've seen in recent memory and it is definitely not something to be missed. Although I found the ending to be a bit cliche and underwhelming, it is forgivable in the scope of the entire series. Psycho-Pass is a very large undertaking and I wouldn't recommend binging on it too much or you might forget important stuff. I've just gotta say one thing WATCH IT.\n        "},

The character development was really smooth and you had the feeling that you were in a chess game and you had to predict the move of your oponent at any cost. \nAlthought the plot was rather interesting i felt at some part that there are some gaps or that there shud have been more feedback on some characters. For example it would be interesting to see Makishima's backround story. \n I also enjoyed the music and the quality of the animation \n"},

But it is not for everyone.  \nI suspect those who can appreciate this gem are mature male audience, since I found some women and teenagers getting freaked out (or bored) watching it.\nI think the Psycho-Pass should also be categorized as a thriller, seinen anime.\nI don't want to give synopsis or partial assessment (story. character etc) about this anime. I'll just tell you my personal impressions why I think this is an outstanding anime:\n- the intense feeling I felt when watching Psycho-Pass reminds me a lot when I watched Holywood movie like Prison Break or Se7en or Monster (anime),\n          \n        if not greater (If you can enjoy those movies, then quickly grab this anime)\n- The bleak atmosphere and the cruelty were presented \"beautifully\" (successfully convey the impression of horror while leaving out the gruesome details)\n- The antagonist is not a maniac who kills people for fun or to rule the world. He isn't either the Hannibal type or the Moriarty type. He's a class of his own.\n- The protagonist has a formidable faith about right and wrong. \n- The story was compact. As you watch later episodes, you'll realize that there's a main plot hidden. It will start slow, but the plot will climax and give you a sense of an end.\n- The ending is not ridiculous. I think it's better than Monster (anime). \n- Cant wait for season 2.\n        "},

The same production company that did Ghost in the Shell and the same writer of Madoka Magica, known for plot twists and thought provoking storylines, Psycho Pass does not disappoint. From the very first episode, I was hooked! The setting is beautifully detailed, the music is very fitting, and characters are well developed.\nI highly recommend Psycho Pass to everyone, especially if you are a fan of Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, or Madoka. \n"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    Story (6/10)\n- Concept (4/5)-\nThe anime has two core concepts, its philosophy and science fiction. A vast mixture of existentialistic ideas to Grecian ideas and the law flourished its philosophical side and guns that can decode the human’s mind on its scifi side. Nothingness, selfishness, the theory of evolution, striving for complexity, human’s dark nature, the soul and the law. A lot of great ideas inside a 22 episode long anime. Very repetitive ideas passed down through history inside a science fiction anime. \nWhat makes this anime so special? For the general anime watchers, perhaps the fact that most humans cannot accept what kind of existence\n          \n        humans has – how our desires or the wills conflict in terms of way it is attained. Urobuchi is known for manipulating people’s emotions which causes people to get hook and cause deep despair once they fall for the characters or reveal dejecting ideas that causes conflict with their own beliefs of what is right and wrong or in other words, their view on morality or ethics. On the other hand, people who are not against these ideas or people who would also be rational and not care about human feelings and loves watching tragic stories, they might feel rather good seeing chaos, bloodshed and gore in action.  Lastly, what makes this anime rather popular is the fujoshi and fudanshi. They will find the idea of two guys chasing – a Shizo x Izaya formula – and trying to kill each other rather hot. At the very beginning of the anime until the very end of the anime, suggestions that these two are perfect for each other with the lines, “This destiny must have awaited them since long before they had even met.” The ending will most make any fujoshi and fudanshi lose their sanity.\nWhat makes this anime not so special? Gen Urobuchi’s repetitive ideas and formulas. It is very similar to his other works but of a different genre. A good example is how he changed a yuri “Puella Magi Madoka Magica” into a yaoi science fiction:\n1.	Magic : Science\n2.	Magical Girls : Inspectors and Enforcers\n3.	Kyuubey : The Sibyl System\n4.	Yuri : Yaoi\n5.	Homura and Madoka : Kougami and Makishima\nIn the end, a good way to summarize Psycho Pass is psychopaths within psychopaths. For anyone who enjoys dark and tragic stories, one might enjoy these idea altogether.\n-Organization (2/5)-\nThe directing is both bad and good. I could think of better way to organize the scenes in able to hook the audience and surprise them. They did not unleash Gen Urobuchi’s full potential.\nIn my case, the organization was rather predictable with its typical detective police formula. The series has a lot of great ideas but because of its bad directing, it did not reach its full potential. Additionally, the formula is not at all different from Urobuchi’s past works, especially its high resemblance to Madoka’s formula (Ending Preview + Typical Detective/Magical Girls Work + Character’s Stories/Flash Backs + Shock Factors/Climax Ending) The only good thing about its directing is how it subconsciously gets the characters into your mind with its repetitive mentioning of this Makishima person. They did some directing right by adding some mystery – a little something the audience to look forward to. \nArt (8/10)\n-Memorability/Originality (6/8)-\nThe character designs are pretty generic but the background and the science fiction art is very eye catching and unique. Those guns, those holograms, the system, those creative gadgets are something we can remember the anime by. It has high futuristic feels that is almost very unique. Holograms are a not so new idea but, in this case, there was a special twist. The biggest and the most memorable thing about this anime’s art are their guns. How it is used and what it does. Those epic guns that they call dominators.\n-Quality (2/2)-\nIt is very detailed, eye popping and futuristic. The use of 3D techniques is flawless. The action scenes are incredible and OP and ED even get a very special place. The backgrounds were not rushed, nor are there slide shows all over the place. It is not stiff, it is free flowing. \nSounds (8/10)\n-Background Music/Sounds (4/4)-\nExcellent job with this one. The music is very fitting for every single moment. It really does enhance the feeling. Sound effects are great. It makes the “action” theme stand out. \n-Voice (3/4)-\nVery good voice acting. There are some very generic voice types for generic people but overall, great. Sexy voices for fujoshi and fudanshi to fantasize about. \n-OP/ED (1/2)-\nIt has a good rock feeling. Fits the series very well. It is good but something really catchy? Maybe not. Maybe it is. It is not bad but it is not something that will go down for ages. \nCharacters (9/10)\nPsychopaths! Psychopaths! Psychopaths!\nVery memorable characters with crazy and epic personalities. Some characters are rather dull and generic, especially some of the villains or suspects. It has a very strong female lead and characters with strong sense of justice and conflicting ideas about justice and peace. It has a lot of strong characters with strong personalities so if other characters are rather dull because of its stereotypical feels but the good over shines the bad characters.\nAkame – that strong not so good looking character with strong sense of justice and love for the law.\nKougami – that sexy hot headed freak with his sense of justice and solving skills.\nKagari – that “Hitachiin” character that hates the law.\nGinoza – that fool who abides the law in every way that he can.\nMasaoka – that typical dog with epic fighting skills.\nMakishima – that beautiful man with a beautiful mind.\nThe biggest legacy on this show is the good use of the Shizuo x Izaya formula on the two male leads. It is unquestionable that it will go down in fujoshi and fudanshi or in other words, “Yaoi History.” Especially with that ending. No doubt about it. \nEnjoyment (7/10)\nThere are a lot of bad sides with regards to the story and its directing but overall, a really good anime that I enjoyed watching – concepts that I can relate two and a character that I can relate to, being that psychopath who views the world objectively or nothing or without any purpose, chose to detached himself from the norms and enjoys his ideas and watching the world burn.\nThat ending filled with despair made the series memorable to me. People who find despair pleasurable would most likely enjoy this series given if the one watching can relate to a certain character. Additionally, being a fujoshi made the entire series worth watching. Fantasizing every little move that they make and every obsession that they make towards another male character."},

I loved all three of those series because they made me think about justice, rebellion, and equality in a different light (no pun intended). This anime I feel is a combination of three. The heavy emphasis of justice combined with technology. It kinda speaks to the death note fans. As for Code Geass fans, the tech here is a really cool gun.

Most of the characters were solid, and I was able to identify with Akane quite strongly. The whole concept of a psycho pass is very flawed though. It's not possible to simplify psychology down to a colour and number. No society could actually be based on that. That's my biggest criticism of the show. But putting that aside, I thought the plot played out well and gave the viewer a lot to think about.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Hi this is my first review, I hope this helps you understand how I feel about the anime Psycho-pass and determine whether or not it's right for you :).\nUtopia, a world where everything is considered perfect, both socially and politically. Psycho-Pass is an futuristic \"utopia\" anime where everyone is given everything they want, and instead of worrying about the future everyone is \"happy\" and a system makes everyone's choices. As all animes, there are people who dislike the way the system works and there are \"heroes\" who are there to protect current life style.\nThe story is from a the point of view of a \"noobie\"\n          \n        inspector (akane) who recently began her career as a detective.\nStory: 9\nThe story was very thrilling and enjoyable and the twist and turns are unexpected. Unlike most anime's that are made, this one made it harder to guess what would happen next. The story is different from most animes/mangas. The director of this anime did an amazing job to make you feel the same way the characters are feeling (similar to clannad), when the characters were undergoing depression you could really understand their position and feel bad, same as when the characters suceeded in accomplishing a goal you felt happy. \nArt: 9 \nThe art is typical like any other new anime that came out, it is exceptional and very well made. The art for the characters were really well done and the amount of detail added to the backgrounds and scenery of each episodes is just magnificent (art for the main character could have been different imo)\nSound: 9\nHonestly the type of music they chose for each scene was perfect and not repetitive (that is imo). Music is the key to success in any anime, with proper use of music you can turn a boring scene (on the couch sleeping) to something completely different. I feel that Psycho-Pass really used music to their advantage and created scenes that had a very tense vibe.\nCharacter: 10 \nI love the character development that occurred. Everyone within the anime had some sort of turning point that made them change, thus realizing they could be doing so much more with their lives. Not much else to say about this part pretty typical character development but I personally really enjoyed the way they changed.\nEnjoyment: 8\nThe reason why this part is an 8 is because I felt like there was something missing from the ending of the anime. I disliked that feeling it felt like a piece of my heart was missing as I was nearing the ending of the anime (not gonna spoil :))))) ). Other than that fact I thought this anime was well made and deserves to be top 100's, but not one of my favourites.  \nOverall: 9\nIf you enjoy an anime that deals with crimes and psychology (the way people think) then this anime is the one for you! I also feel like this anime is targeted at an older audience specifically those who are in grade 12 or older. I feel this way because the terminology used in the anime seems like it may be harder to understand for a younger audience and to those who are not in the science area. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    While at first a story about an idealistic future, Psycho-Pass presents ideas and actions that are much more than meets the eye: a great show that I would recommend to fans of action anime. \nStory: The story of this anime presents a very interesting concept in that it gives us a society in which machines are able to analyze your psychology and determine pretty much everything about you--from your likelihood of becoming a criminal to what job you are most suited for. Pretty much nothing is decided for you anymore, which is, as I said, an interesting concept with a lot of consequences that Psycho-Pass\n          \n        manages to explore. There is also the main plot consisting of people committing crimes and trying to hunt down the perpetrators. Whichever point you find to be most interesting, Psycho-Pass is an anime that will frequently have you on the edge of your seat with suspense as you try and figure out what is going to happen next. \nArt: I enjoyed the art style. It was nice and modern with darker colors to suit the theme of the show. There were some parts where I felt the art was somewhat lacking, but for the most part, I found it to be very fitting and nice to look at. \nSound: Honestly, I really liked both opening themes and really didn't like either ending theme, so the music there is just so-so overall. In terms of the soundtrack during actual episodes, nothing really stuck out to me all too much in either a negative or a positive way, so I have to say that the music was just good overall. Nothing particularly amazing, but nothing really bad or annoying, either .\nCharacters: I think that all of the characters were very interesting. A problem that I have, though, is that this anime kind of fails at expanding into the background of many of the main characters. I would have liked to learn more about each of the main characters in more detail than what was given. That being said, I do think that many of the characters were very interesting, especially the main villain. He struck me as very unique and he really makes the viewer think about the situations within Psycho-Pass, and who is really 'right' and who is really 'wrong.' I enjoyed that aspect.\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this anime quite a lot. I wouldn't necessarily say that it was life changing in any way, or anything of that nature, but it was interesting to watch, and I had a fun time watching it. \nOverall, I rated Psycho-Pass with an 8 instead of a 9 because, while I liked many aspects of this anime, the ending bothered me quite a lot and I had to rate it down. That's all I'll say on the matter here for the sake of avoiding spoilers, but overall, I'll say that regardless of the ending, its' still an anime worth watching and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.\n        "},

Those who are in charge of enforcing the law and apprehending those with high crime coefficients are part of the Public Safety Bureau. The story mostly follows Akane Tsunemori, a new member of Unit 1 in the Public Safety Bureau. As the story unfolds, you learn how twisted some members of society can be and how society has changed, whether it\n          \n        be for better or for worse. I won't write anymore on the story, for fear of spoilers. I went into the anime knowing absolutely nothing, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I recommend those who are reading this review and are interested in the anime do the same.\nArt:\nThe art is absolutely phenomenal. It is actually what attracted me to the anime in the first place. I always enjoyed Katekyo Hitman Reborn's art, so I had high expectations for this anime; I was pleasantly surprised. All the characters were beautifully drawn, and the animations were very smooth and 'eye candy'-ish. The artwork, however, had a very different feel from Hitman Reborn as well. Being that it was Sci-Fi instead of Shounen, you will notice the difference. The artwork reminded me of a combination of Hitman Reborn's style + Ghost In the Shell + Gantz. The twisted artistic moments and gore especially reminded me of Gantz, and are probably much too strong for younger viewers. But for someone who can appreciate this form of artwork, they will be thoroughly impressed. Everything is detailed, all the way to the great backgrounds. It portrays the differences in our society and theirs almost as well as the characters and stories do. (Sidenote: There are multiple opening and closing credits, those were also very well done. I'm the kind of person who watches a new opening/closing credit once, and then skips them every future episode until a new opening/closing credit comes. Yet these ones, particularly the opening ones, were great and tempted me to watch them over and over each episode).\nSound:\nThe music was well chosen, and always did a good job of invoking a feeling from me, the viewer. Whether it be suspense, fear, or any other emotion, the music executed it's task. However, I did notice when the same music was replayed a few episodes later. Obviously music is recycled constantly in anime, but it would have been nice to have seen a little more variety. (Side note: The opening and closing credit songs, like the artwork, were very well done/chosen. They were catchy, and made watching them pleasant).\nCharacter(s):\nHere, besides the artwork, is where I feel Psycho-Pass shined most. We come into the anime with absolutely no knowledge of anything; essentially, we're just as inexperienced as the protagonist Akane. But as the story goes on, we form opinions of these characters and learn of different relations and their feelings. All the characters are complex, as real humans are, and also very understandable. They're predictable, but unpredictable. My personal favorite character was Kogami, because of how he was drawn and how cool he was. But I seriously enjoyed every character, even antagonists who I felt I should hate, or side characters that I felt like I shouldn't care about too much. You will find yourself enthralled in character developement and find yourself tied to characters before you even know it. \nEnjoyment and Overall:\nOverall, this anime was VERY well done. I was almost tempted to give it a 10/10, but I wouldn't say this anime is perfect, at least not for me. But don't take that as me putting the anime down, because it is an INCREDIBLE anime. It may very well be in my top 10 anime series of all time. All of the aspects work very well together, and the length of the story was perfect. I really wish I could go into more detail and talk about the parts that drew particular emotions and reactions out of me, but I don't want to take that from you who may watch this anime. But I'm almost positive you will have your emotional strings being pulled like a guitar, and not necessarily in a sad way either. To be entirely honest, I was a little skeptical of this anime because I do not usually enjoy Sci-Fi anime (like Ghost in the Shell or Gantz). However, to my surprise, I really enjoyed this one. I highly recommend this anime, especially to anyone who enjoys science fiction.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    In these past few years, few series have had the insight and impact that the animes of yesteryear did. Instead of deep stories about comlex topics worth discussing with peers or themes worthy of being dissected and perhaps even accepted into a new kind of literary canon, animes nowadays have either been more of the same or be bless with only a few dashes of creativity. Now, some argue that anime has never been better, but that is simply because the audience has now changed. \nAs if to respond to the gaping whole that series like Trigun and Ghost in the Shell: SAC left behind,\n          \n        Psycho Pass comes out of left field, taking the futuristic action of  the latter mentioned series and super-charging it with a modern twist. What results is a great anime, but let's see how good it really is...\nSTORY 10/10\nThe story of Psycho-Pass is centered around the MWPSB, the special unit of the Ministry of Wellfare tasked with upholding the order set by the Sibyl System. This future is much different from the interpretations of others series, mostly because its both fantastic yet surprisingly plausible. People are judged by the system in question and are given a few potential careers that the system believes will not only give happiness to the individual, but to the most amount of people of society. Quite utilitarian to say the least. However, not only does the system govern job opportunities, but it also designates people who it believes to be criminals with a number known as a Crime Coefficient. Thus is the setting for this story...\nThe episode layout begins with more scattered approach, allowing the viewer to understand different aspects of the world, such as the online social media system, the schooling system, the law enforcement code and more. From there, a mastermind is slowly revealed and the main plot begins. Throughout the story, characters evolve based off their interactions with the world around them, whether they witness a gruesome death or begin to question the validity of the system that rules them. No one is static in this series and characters die at the drop of a hat, showing that there is no flimsy \"plot armor\" to protect them. This makes every encounter a thrill ride and a few well placed moments make all the difference. The series never insults your intelligence and those who are familiar with various authors may get a kick out of having some works referenced similar to how GitS references Salinger in the first season. \nThe ending is something that Psycho-Pass does well. It wraps of nicely and has a great deja vu feeling. Its also a bit opened ended, leaving room for the upcoming second season. \nArt 9/10\nAnother strong area, this series does a good job animating the various action scenes, whether its an intense game of cat and mouse in the sewers or a showdown in a drone warehouse. The palette is dark, but is appropriate for the anime and character designs as a whole make people stand out. There are even some contrasts in outfit designs between the two main opponents, adding subtle details that separate this anime from the rest of the pack. One thing must be said, however: Episode 18 ruins the near perfect score. I've seen poor animation before, but this episode was just sad. I know there were extenuating circumstances, but the lack of quality can't be ignored. Until I watch a revised version of the episode (which I probably will in the near future), this anime cannot get a 10/10 for the animation category.\nSound 8/10\nPsycho-Pass has a few good tracks, like the ones that play during the last few episodes, but the rest of the tracks are more or less unremarkable. The EGOIST endings are good, with the first one being better than the second, but the openings are mediocre, which is a shame.The voice acting is top notch, though, which is a definite plus. \nCharacters 9/10\nBecause the series starts off slightly episodic, a few characters come and go without much development. The antagonists are pretty interesting, as are the MWPSB, but the other side characters (I'm looking at you, random high school school girls!) take away from the sophisticated air of the series. In addition, some relationships (or rather, one in particular that occurs during the latter part of episode 22) appear without an prior indication of them existing. It wasn't bad, just unpleasantly surprising. \nWith hard hitters like Nobuchika, Masaoka and Kogami leading the pack in character quality, the main cast certainly isn't lacking. Sadly, one of the charactesr, Yayoi, is left with her arc unfulfilled, which is sad since she was becoming quite interesting. Overall, great characters marred by a few tail-coat riders. \nEnjoyment 9/10\nIn all honesty, the first 5 minutes of Psycho Pass completely befuddled of me. It went straight  into a further part of the series without explaining the basics, which dumbfounded me and drove me off for an entire year. However, when I came back I found an anime that I will remember fondly.\nIf you're a classical junky like me and want an experience on par with GitS, look no further. With great characters, a intelligent story and top notch artistic direction, Psycho-Pass is the future cop show we have been waiting for!\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    I came across Psycho-pass while going over the recommendations for death note. What I expected was a seat gripping, heart wrenching, cat and mouse police-criminal chase involving some hardcore battle of wits. While, not exactly that, Psycho-pass was along the lines of it.\nHere is a world of computers and everything is controlled by Cybil, a system that determines all walks of life. The difference between good and evil, law and order and the prevention of crimes is all in the hands of cybil.\nEveryone has a psycho pass,  a detector which determines their potential as a criminal. If their hue is dark, they are deemed\n          \n        latent criminals, if they are beyond redemption they get executed, if not, they get therapy to manage their hues.\nSome of these latent criminals are used in the police force to assist them in cases. After all, the best way to catch a criminal is to think like one. These particular latent criminals are called hunting dogs.\nEnter, Shinya Kougami, a former detective turned hunting dog, fueled by the need to avenge the murder of a comrade. Also enter, Shougo Makishima,  the murderer of the said comrade.\nAfter three years of dead ends, Kougami is met with a spark of hope when he sees the signs of the devil's return in a recent murder.\nSo Kougami under his supervisor, Akane (female protogonist) and band of detectives sets off in a goose chase that can only lead to mayhem and murder.\nPsycho-pass isn't exactly a suspense anime. I mean, sure, it creates a dire need in the viewers to know what will happen next but not in a 'what will the bad guy do next and how will the good guy respond way' but in a more 'how will it all end way'. The strategies and the twists don't come on as a shock and they are, dare I say, predictable. It almost seemed intended as the viewers are given obvious clues from the start leading to the big discovery. This begs the question of what makes Psycho-pass a great anime?\nIt's the way the story flows. The philosophical and spirtual outlook gives the anime an outstanding feel. The dialogues seem to be the essence of the anime. The lines of the characters are so fetching, that you hang on to their every word and Makishima definitely has a way with words and we love how Kougami thinks too.\nThe character development is great. Every character has a story and they aren't made to be fickle or hollow. Akane's character seems to evolve the most. A rookie at first, she emerges into a strong determined woman fighting for what she thinks is right.\nKougami, our protagonist has his own distinct style, a rough exterior but a genuine kind personality. He is smart, intellectual and driven. Sure, he is bloodthirsty for revenge but his goodness can be seen in his interactions with Akane. \nThe supporting characters too have their own standing and they mould the story nicely.\nAnd then there is Shougo Makishima.  Well . He is surely one of my favorite anime characters. He is such a charismatic villain that he will charm your wits off. All along the anime, I kept making excuses for his actions even if it was obvious he was in the wrong. He wanted the society to break free of restraints and act on their own free will. Though, he wanted that just so he could enjoy it. Life was a game to him and he was winning. He had an attractive personality and a face to match. To put it simply, he is quite the badass.\nAs a fair warning, I have to say Psycho-pass is not for the faint hearted. After all, it is rated R+. Its based on police work and so rape and murder is daily news. Also, the anime doesn't really strike until after the thirteenth episode, now as it has fully accomplished in setting a background story, from here onwards, the plot skyrockets and I found  20-22 episodes to be quite beautiful. \nThe art was spectacular, the opening credits make you want to mimic the choreography, frankly put ; it is so damn cool. The music, though not exemplary,  is good enough to set the mood and create an epic backdrop.\nWhile it is not on the same pedestal as death note or code geass, Psycho-pass is definitely worth watching.\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    So this was a good show. I'm used to watching many shows in a row that can be easily binged, but every once in a while, I come to a show like this where the best course of action is watching one or two episodes at a time. That's not to say that this show can't be binged, but I feel that the impact resonates a lot better if you give some time between episodes. And similarly to other shows that I prefer not to binge watch, the beginning doesn't do much for me. However, in just a matter of a few episodes, it hooks\n          \n        me in and I rather enjoy the endeavors of out main characters.\nIn a world where your criminal activity can be monitored by a computer network and even the potential of committing crime can put you in jail, what happens when there is a flaw in the system? As a new recruit for the MWPSB, our fictional police force in this show, Akane Tsunemori works with other detectives and latent criminals known as Enforcers to bring down those who the computer network, known as the Sibyl System, views as a threat to society.\nPsycho-Pass is one of those circumstances where the show feels almost perfect in length. Sure, there could've been another 10 minutes or so given to summarize what occurs in the  last episode, but 22 episodes is a very solid length for this season. I particularly enjoyed this length because it wasn't pointless at any time whatsoever. Sure, the first episode or so had almost nothing to do with the main plot, but it provides exposition, something some shows tend to neglect. Then, once those first few episodes pass, everything from there on out focuses on the main plot, with only an episode or so of filler. And the really cool thing is that you don't even realize that all these different crimes are interconnected until a ways into the series, and once this is revealed, things really start to pick up.\nThe interactions between the detectives and Enforcers may just be the most entertaining thing about this show. Criminals in this society are viewed so poorly that Enforcers, even though they devote their lives to working for the police, are restricted from leaving the MWPSB headquarters. And so to see the detectives interact with these supposed criminals is very interesting, as just being around someone with a higher Psycho-Pass (the scale used to determine your functionality in society) can alter your own. Yet, these criminals are very much needed, as they know how other criminals think and are vital to the conclusion of most cases. The Enforcers are all also quite unique and enjoyable characters, even if they do come across as a bit gruff sometimes. This isn't to say that the detectives aren't enjoyable, but they definitely didn't appeal to me as much as the Enforcers did.\nI can't say much for the soundtrack in this show and I don't know if that's good or bad. The opening themes are very different, but each is good in their own way, and the ending themes were okay, though I did rather enjoy the 2nd one quite a bit. But as for the actual soundtrack, I didn't really notice it. And that's not entirely bad. Soundtracks enhance a show, they don't make the show, so if all you can get from a show is its soundtrack, that's not good. On the other hand, if a soundtrack isn't detectable at all, then what point does it serve? I know it was there, for sure, but I can't honestly sit here and give you and example of when it was a stand-out sort of thing.\nAnimation is solid. The show is fairly new so I didn't expect much else. The times when the Dominators (the guns used by the MWPSB) and other components of the Sibyl System were used were definitely the highlights of this shows art style, but in the end, it was, as a whole, nothing really spectacular.\nPsycho-Pass, at least I feel, caters to a very specific audience. Those who love crime shows and mysteries will love it, though anyone who is looking for something else should look elsewhere. However, even if it doesn't incorporate everything that makes masterpiece shows great, the show does what it needs to and does it very well.\nPositives:\n+Great opening themes\n+Ending themes were also better than what I'm used to\n+Characters, especially those of the Enforcers, were fantastic\n+Plot was genuinely thrilling and mysterious\n+Characters deaths actually made me feel something\n+Animation is kinda decent, though is does excel at certain times\n+One of the greatest villains and rivalries I've seen in a while\n+Perfect length with little filler\nNegatives:\n-Soundtrack wasn't anything special\n-Ending was sudden and didn't wrap things up very well ( though there is a second season )\n-Only would appeal to people who want to watch something specifically like this; not for just casual viewers\nPsycho-Pass is highly enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to watch a good crime show or something just on the darker side of anime. With a whole second season I have yet to watch, I'm excited to get started soon, as this show is very good at capturing your attention. So give it a shot. You may just like it as much as I did.\nAnd that's why I give Psycho-Pass a 9/10\n        "},

The society in Psycho pass is no where as a Utopian place as you might thing. The Sybil System is a system striving to better society by making use of regulating people's esteem issues. Like for instance if a person gets too excited or becomes vastly angry or stressed- in a moment these emotions can practically destroy them and we use \"psycho pass\" as another way of conveying this. As I've said earlier even if\n          \n        the Sibyl System strives for a perfect Utopian society; ones that brings people together.

After watching all 22 episodes of the series, I believe it's quite an outstanding anime; something thats difficult to find in my humble opinion. \nThe story is original, its art has the perfect style to fit the story, and the characters are mostly intriguing. Although I consider this an anime near perfection, and can easily be comparable to some of the best animes out there; such as Death note, Full metal alchemist: Brotherhood, and Code Gease, it still\n          \n        has some flaws. \nStory: Psycho-pass focuses on a future based era; one in which your mental state dictates your crime potential, in a society near perfection. The reason why I've given this a 10/10 is not just because its an original story, that is untold of, but because its a possible, and realistic story that could potentially be the future.\nArt: The art is splendid. the characters, and animation behind the series fits perfectly with the setting, and helps the viewer follow up with the story, by creating a pleasant experience using its art style. \nSound: Without a doubt the sounds are well done, and the OST fits well with the story. However, although the OST's are pleasurable to listen to individually, they sometimes to grab your full attention during the series, which ends up becoming unnoticeable. None the less, if you aren't greatly engaged with what's happening in the scene, the OST's sound great according to what the story has to tell.\nCharacter: Characters are very likable, and a lot of character development is seen through out the story. However, not enough of it is present to every character. Some characters are better developed then others, and some leave us wondering what their story is. None the less, they managed to hit the key points to the major characters, which what matters mostly. It would be nice to see some more background story from minor characters. \nEnjoyment: The thing you will love about Psycho-pass is that it'll leave you on the edge of your chair, having you anticipate and speculate what'll happen next! The overall experience is very enjoyable, even if the anime starts off slow to give you a better understanding of the story, and characters before jumping into the plot, it still manages to have you keep watching! \nOver all Psycho-pass is a MASTERPIECE in my opinion. It's original story, great art, and sound, along side the likable characters that will have you enjoy the story makes this anime a one of a kind, and most certainly a 10/10! "},

It is actually about the system of justice in Japan that serve as the \"Judge\" whether a certain person is committed a crime or not through a scanner, the \"cymatic scan\".\nStory: \nI give this anime's story a perfect score because this kind of story is very unique. It is about a police inspector and how the system of justice callled the \"Sibyl system\" works in Japan and how it affects people's live as well as the main characters. If you liked Death Note, this anime is perfect for you because\n          \n        their story is both mainly about justice. In Death Note's point of view, Kira is acting like a \"God\" while in this anime, the god is the \"sibyl system\". Well I definitely recommend it, not only to \"Sci-fi\" fans but also to other audiences as well.\nArt:\nAs I said earlier, the story's theme is futuristic therefore you'll expect a futuristic world where technology/robots are controlling Japan by acting as the police and judge that decides the fate of a certain person/criminal. The weapons of the enforcer/inspector(the police in this story) is also controlled by the\nsibyl system and this is the one who will turn that weapon or gun (called as \"dominator\") either a paralyzer or a weapon that will destroy the criminal, leaving no trace of evidence or just a weapon that will simply kill the person depending to the person's  state of mind called as the \"Psycho Pass\". Well it's cool how this weapon works.\nSound:\nI gave the sound 9 because:\n I based it on the op/ending songs which is not my taste I gave it an 8 and \nThe background music, and other is very appropriate to the scenes so i gave it a 10. \nResulting to a score of 9. hehe\nCharacter:\nI gave it a 10 because each characters have an equal contribution to the plot of the story. The change of the perspective and attitudes of the characters is nice as the story goes on.\nEnjoyment:\nIn this anime, at the first episodes, I kinda feel depressed because of the happenings. But at the same time, the flow of the story excites me that makes me excited for the next episodes and so on. The story is very challenging and you may also have perspective in the story, either a \"Pro-sibyl system\" or \"anti-sibyl system\". But be careful of the hue of your psycho pass! *go watch the anime if you don't get it* =)\nOverall:\nSo overall the anime is very outstanding. You shouldn't miss this kind of anime which is a unique kind of sci-fi genre. The characters have provoking and persuasive kinds of dialogue. It has a great plot and also very exciting as the story flows. A very entertaining anime and I definitely recommend it. So go watch it! "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    About the STORY\nThis somehow will remind you of “The Minority Report” by Steven Spielberg; a futuristic world where you are judged by a system which is almost looks perfect but still makes the world so flawless. It’s the question of “whether one shoot pull the trigger” just because the system tells you to. It’s a story about beliefs and how strong one’s resolve to hold on to those beliefs. There’s a healthy dose of violence and profanity but that’s one should expect from the writer who can balance a good story and violence. It is episodic at the beginning which is perfect for an investigative\n          \n        kind of plot the story has. The story has quite a deep way of explaining things which can be somewhat beyond the understanding for some. On the other hand, for some who’s open-minded, the flow of story can be very interesting on its own way. \nAbout the CHARACTERS\nMain characters are strong, personality-wise; a character that has dark past and goes the path of revenge for an old enemy and a female lead which is an innocent and novice character enters the world of violence which will test her resolve and beliefs. However, as the story goes by, the female lead becomes the epitome of how the age of “damsel in distress” should have ended already. With the kind of story the series has, the villains are always the most interesting. These kinds of villains will always leave someone thinking, “He has a point there”.  You could even say that he’s more concern about human beings than anybody from the series. At the end, a viewer will have conflicting feelings of disliking and liking the villain which proves how a character can be effective and in my book that’s a plus.\nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUNDS\nIf you’re someone who’s been around in the anime world in a long time, you are most likely very familiar with the animation since it’s similar to a certain anime (Katekyo Hitman Reborn)! The character designs are quite different from Reborn series. However, the most noticeable are the two main characters that have the strong resemblance with some Reborn’s characters; Kougami looks like Kyouya and Tsunemori looks like Yuni. Setting aside the similarities from Reborn! series, the animation is still undoubtedly way more detailed and amazingly done particularly when the “Dominators” are involve. And even the fight scenes are one of a kind. A series with a cool sound I’ve heard in a long time; opening songs, ending songs, and even the insert songs are really cool. \nAbout the ENJOYMENT\nIt may have resemblance to Reborn but that doesn’t mean they are written by the same person as this series is SO much greater than Reborn series. The storyline conveys conflicting feelings for any type of viewer and stimulate one’s way of thinking which I believe what a worthwhile watching experience should be. I guess the moral lesson is that at the end of the day, human beings are still the ones who should handle their lives. They are the ones who should decide right from wrong and good from evil. They are the ones who should carry the burden and overcome them. After all, they may look fragile but we humans still survived living the harsh reality of the world after all this long, LONG years of daring to live life."},

I managed to start watching again after the series had finished broadcasting and I can say that I don't regret it. The series is basically a minority report set in the realm of science rather then people telling the future. It worked really well in incorporating the use of the dominator weapon as opposed to the act of seeing someone commit a crime and then stopping them before they do. \nThe story itself really picks up around 10, the main\n          \n        story is something that most people would enjoy. It is addicting and draws you in, I thought it would just give us the premise of the psycho pass and then we would follow the characters and team as the solve crimes upon this basis. However the actual main story without giving away any spoilers is far better and more thrilling. \nThe characters are well drawn and all round sympathetic. I even found myself sympathizing with the Villain in the story. The villain is believable and charismatic, he is capable of such evil and cruelty and yet as the story progresses and more specifically after the plot twist we understand more his reasoning but that does not make actions justified. The enforcers were all around great characters, they were hard to see as latent criminals just because they showed none of the signs of being crazy, or anything like that but throughout they are treated as almost sub-human. They are seen as dogs, and I found that fascinating in a way since the inspectors are so reliant on them and yet at the same time they see them as a nuisance. \nReally enjoyed the music, not much of an expert in this area but it was great listening, i usually skip through but I sat through the entire episode including the OP and ED, second anime I have done this to after Samurai Champloo. \nArt was great, characters were well drawn and easy identifiable, without making all of them generic in a sense, they all seemed unique. Which is not as common as one may think, there are many anime where characters are drawn generically and just some hair etc is changed but here you were really able to see the individualism in each character. The scenery was excellent, really helped the story moved fluidly against such beautiful backdrops and well drawn futuristic metropolitan.   \nAll in all I really enjoyed the anime, the ending did leave me a bit unfulfilled but it was still a good ending.

While I didn't find\n          \n        myself overly emotionally attached to any one character, the characters are likable and the story is compelling. Most noticeable is perhaps the graphics. Psycho-Pass is visually pleasing and I often found myself enjoying background and cg transition cuts. Honestly the only thing I can complain about is that I wish the season was longer than 22 episodes.\nUltimately the anime can be described as CSI and Dexter mixed with \"techy sci-fi stuff\". I would definitely recommend to mature anime watchers.\n        "},

As an Inspector, she hunts criminals alongside a special team of so-called latent criminals called Enforcers. Both Enforcers and Inspectors use large handguns called \"Dominators\", special weapons designed to fire only on those with a higher-than-acceptable Crime Coefficient. Even though Akane is ashamed of shooting the Enforcer Shinya Kogami during her first mission to protect a latent criminal, Kogami thanks her for stopping him from becoming a murderer which convinces Akane to stay. During some of Akane's first investigations, the group learns of a mastermind behind multiple crimes, Shogo Makishima. Being Criminally Asymptomatic (免罪体質 Menzai Taishitsu?), Makishima's criminal psychology yields a low Crime Coefficient, thus rendering him safe from the Dominator.\nI got to say…….it didn’t felt like a police procedural at all, at least until most episodes go by but the first few episodes does set up the main plotline (being that a slow build-up works it up instead of being too rapid) plus it does turn into a different shell of its own and that’s when it hit me. This show is quite reminiscent of Production I.G’s flagship series, Ghost in the Shell, as the show does have some similarities with the cyberpunk and dystopian elements intact and there is the concept of law and order being played into the show (and for the record, I’m not calling it a clone). Questions like what if the law doesn’t work in your favor? What if you felt like even with the law, you aren’t always protected? Should you obey the law or defy them in order to protect yourself?  It is something that many of us question to this very day, it’s something that remains very relevant and vital up to this day and showing that when some of that does get to you at the end of the day. Plus, it does help that the writing quality is top-notch and it does handle those subject carefully.\nCharacters are also good in quality albeit most of the supporting characters don’t have much screen time (aside from a standalone episode about Yayoi and that’s about it) but they are developed as multi-dimensional characters and they never come off as being morally black or white, just morally in-between grey, especially the main character Akane Tsunemori, who might be that character that got me interested as being the rookie who’s learning her way around as an Inspector and it wasn’t going to be an easy one, especially when it gets to the latter half and the way the former transitions to that half, I got a little emotional towards some parts especially at what happens at Episode 11 and man…..Episode 11…..Holy shit. (DAMN YOU, UROBUCHI!!! YOU MASTERFUL MOTHER--) Shogo Makishima is that mastermind villain that shows that he isn’t that fucked up in the head when his cynical but impartial views about the law and order concept are anatomically correct and Kogami is also another well-developed character, and like the show, does have his choice to either bring justice either by the law or his own hand.\nAnimation-wise, I got to give props at the guys and girls at Production I.G. as the show does look slick, dark, stylish and gorgeous. The character designs aren’t too anime-typical and does have the feel of a live-action show translated into animated form. The CG didn’t feel out of place especially with the Dominator scenes and I will say this as a precaution, there is some over-the-top gore during those Dominator scenes but there isn’t like an uncontrollable amount of it so it isn’t that excessive with it. I can say I can see why his next project Gargantia was toned down on the gore, blood and death.\nMusically, the OP and ED songs are quite listenable, while I do like the 2nd OP more than the first one and for the ED song, I like the 1st one better than the 2nd, although those two are very fast-paced openers/enders while the 1st OP/2nd ED was more slow-paced and there’s nothing wrong with that as they do need a contrast between each other, depending how the episode ends.\nThe FUNimation dub was passable, it gave out some good performances especially from the leads which I have never noticed in their other dub roles and some other performances were OK but it didn’t completely win me over or give any attention to myself. Robert McCollum does bring a good performance as Kogami and I’m pleased with Kate Oxley as Akane and the newcomer of the game, Alex Organ as Makishima delivers a decent job in the dub.\nFINAL VERDICT: When it comes to this show and comparing it to other Urobuchi-written shows, I would put this above Gargantia but below Fate/Zero and Madoka Magica. Is this a good show? Yeah. It’s a great show that has a good amount of action, something that make us think about our ideals about law and order, some moments where you do feel some emotion and it doesn’t hold back but isn’t too excessive with itself. If you’re somebody that likes cyberpunk shows like GiTS, you might enjoy this one."},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    At first, I didn't expect Psycho-Pass to be very great, due to how flat the opening of \"look it's a detective\" seemed. However, it wasn't very long before I was attracted to the plotline, and coupled with the dystopian aspect of the \"perfect\" society, this anime makes for a fun watch.\nThere have always been ideals of a perfect society, whether it be through political and social stances, such as communism, or through the plethora of books the schools demand you read in middle school (the Giver, Animal Farm, etc). Psycho-Pass takes the perfect society to the next level- the great Sibyl System decides everything about\n          \n        your life, including if you should go to jail because there *might* be a possibility of you committing a crime. Almost from the start are the blemishes in this society revealed, and the detective work done by the main character Akane leads to interesting revelations about the society and brings up questions about whether or not a utopia can really exist- if it is run by people, corruption exists, if it is run by computers, un-processable occurrences exist. However, the story is a bit slow at first (the same as every single dystopian novel you have ever been required to read), later speeding up and ending satisfactorily while still demanding a season 2 (which has thankfully been confirmed).\nThe art in this show was absolutely amazing. Although the color choices may seem awkward at first, you'll see that it's really just to represent the dystopian nature of the story. The animation, too, was amazing, and I could find no faults with the art at any time.\nThe sound wasn't anything notably amazing like SnK, but neither was it bad. The Sibyl System's voice may get on your nerves though, so be prepared. I didn't really like either of the opening themes, but supercell is one of my favorite bands and I felt the ending songs (by supercell) were amazing.\nWhat was really great about this show was that all the characters had strong personalities. The two main characters, Akane and Kogami, exhibited a lot of development; however, there were quite a few interesting twists behind the character relations of the minor characters, keeping them largely relevant throughout the series and not just useless bystanders *coughsakuracough*. The conflicting ideals of Akane, the Sibyl System, and Gino, who all stood firm for the idea of \"justice\", brought up several moral questions, which quite reminded me of the moral questions in Code Geass- what is right, and who gets to determine what is right?\nI'd very much like to give this an overall 10, and you probably will too after watching the first season, but don't be hasty! The second season, which will *hopefully* go into the solution to the dystopian society, will really determine if this show is worthy of the \"masterpiece\" title. I marathon-ed this show in one evening and the next morning, and it was so worth it. As a tip from someone who has finished the anime- don't drop this before watching atleast a large handful of episodes. The plot is far better than it lets on in the first few episodes, so I recommend you sit tight and watch this show and get ready for the *hopefully* amazing second season.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n     Let’s talk about Psycho-Pass, an anime written by Gen Urobuchi, everyone’s favorite slayer of prepubescent magical girls. As the writer of some of my favorite anime, I was already well aware of what I was in for the moment I started. Nihilistic and depressing setting/characters/plot/ideology, lots of unnecessarily violent death, and lots of unnecessarily long dialogue concerning philosophical questions ripe for young minds to ponder and old minds to groan about.\nPsycho-Pass was touted in Otaku USA as being mind-numbing and like Ghost in the Shell as far as intelligence is concerned. And I’m not going to refute that it is intelligent, but it’s a\n          \n        very pretentious and douchy and literature professor kind of intelligent. Characters pull quotes out of the air, long quotes mind you, that come from Pascal and Gulliver’s Travels, using them to explain the ideas of the series. Characters sit around reading unnecessarily pretentious literature for no reason. One of the arcs in the middle considering a hunter and his prey seems a lot like The Most Dangerous Game and borders on pretention because of that. Ghost in the Shell had it’s moments, but it was a very smart show in it’s own sort of science fiction way. And while Psycho-Pass has those moments, they’re sprinkled with such attempts at trying hard that it hurts to watch sometimes.\nThe plot concerns a policing organization in a sort of Orwellian future where everything is controlled by a central computer system. These cops at the MWPSB use Dominators, guns that read the psycho-pass of a person. If it’s above a certain level they can kill them, otherwise the guns paralyze the person. The inspectors in the organization use latent criminals, those with high psycho-passes, as the hunting dogs. It’s a very cool idea that is fleshed out well. Throughout the show the small group of people goes after a guy wanting to cause as much havoc as possible by providing weapons of crime to people who would otherwise not be able to commit them. It’s clever and fun to watch unfold.\nThe characters are all likeable, though nobody stands out. It’s not so much a show about characters as the plot. The few times that characters are being fleshed out it’s arbitrary and used either to enlighten us further of Gen’s views of the world or to advance the plot.\nThere are a few errors I came across. First of all, why isn’t the Sibyl System more heavily guarded? If it’s the brain behind life in Japan, why is there absolutely no defense system aside from a coded padlock? Also, in episode eighteen, there’s a point where Kogami is wearing no jacket while he talks to another criminal. Then he’s wearing a jacket. Then he’s not again. It was a strange error that I thought would be hard to mess up in an anime. But I guess not.\nOne of the most commendable things is the fluid martial arts fighting. There are a few scenes of beautiful action that I wish you’d see more of in anime. None of the fights were highly impressive in any sort of way, but the martial arts did remind me of the first and last fights of Samurai Champloo, with fast motion and hard hits.\nOverall, I loved Psycho-Pass. It wasn’t as smart as Ghost in the Shell, definitely not as mind boggling (this is pretty easy to understand science fiction); but I’m glad to see that one of Gen’s philosophy courses in college is doing him well and he’s able to cram all kinds of tidbits of unwanted knowledge into bad guy Makishima. Seriously, the guy is a decent bad guy, but an even better reciter of random quotes (which, by the way, always makes a good bad guy. If you have a bad guy who doesn’t quote the Bible and some old philosopher at least once, then you can’t make an anime).\nFun to watch, fast-paced, and entertaining. It’s recommended.\n        "},

The psychology is crisp, but it's really the philosophy that brings the savory taste you remember when all's said and done...in fact, I'd call it anvilicious if not for being such a poignant topic to begin with. I'm biased, but I think that it's charm all the same.\nI walked in to this expecting Ghost In The Shell: very glad I got something different, from what I can still remember of GITS. From the minute I saw the MC - a cute but serious, \"average\" girl char. with trademark\n          \n        brown hair - who looked like she was laced up and ready to continuously get ravaged by the world around her, I could tell this show was going to focus on the world at hand in detail. \nDidn't disappoint.\nThe character crew feels a little big, if not lanky at first, but everyone makes their stake and settles in pretty nicely, pretty fast. Their growth throughout isn't terribly shocking, but their authenticity as the show progressed keeps the light in their eyes, so to speak. Rest assured the pieces on the board are moving: it's not a terribly static show, but you get who \"The dog, the owner, and the cat they're chasing\" are pretty quick. \nStill had me between curious and edge of my seat though, coming in hard towards the finish!\nThe animation is 50/50 of 3D and anime, but applied where appropriate so you never feel jarred or uncanny between the two. I loved it, really: sharp characters, that smooth feeling of motion, and highly detailed city scenery porn lol. \nNothing explicitly memorable conceptually despite some a few great scenes, but retains it's integrity till the end for sure!\nThe only negatives were the VA work at some odd occasions.\n I watched this on Netflix, switching from English to Japanese and vice versa with subs on the whole time, listening particularly for both critical scenes and any scenes that interested me: where I saw the characters could come alive, you know? \nFor English gotta give more leeway, but surprisingly there were a some scenes where both the Japanese and the English couldn't hold up to the tone, physical animations like shuddering or even just char emphasis. \nI may just be being shrewd though, or awakened new faculties--this prob wouldn't throw others off in watching :).\nAll in all show gets a 8, maaaybe 9/10 for me after just finishing it now. Had me hooked, had me intrigued with all it has to learn, and good pacing. Not completely mind blowing, but when you factor in this just being the first season you're golden.\n        "},

There were times I hoped from the bottom of my heart for the well-being of a character, and other times I wished with all I had for\n          \n        a character to suffer. Despite this, I still felt the impact of a character's death no matter how much I disliked them.\nThe Psycho-Pass anime shows a world in which no one has to make their own decisions, nor do they want to. Many of the characters are outcasts of that world, those labeled \"Latent Criminals\". Their lives were taken from them by an unfeeling system that found them too dangerous.\nAt no point did I feel at all left out of anything. Psycho-Pass presents itself as a powerful, thought-provoking piece. I see it both as a philosophical statement, and as an emotional experience. Never has an anime made me care quite so deeply for a character, let alone its entire cast. I can honestly say Psycho-Pass deserves the highest praise.

From the openings until the credits for the first few episodes, I was sucked in completely and loved every moment. The characters are nothing you wouldn't find in any other garden variety modern anime, but they never cross the border into obnoxious. Unfortunately, when the tale gets around to its central villain, the pace slows down significantly and not in the \"Explore a simple concept from many interesting angles.\" sort of way, more in the \"Adding water to\n          \n        Coca Cola just makes more Coca Cola right?\" sort of way. I found the political structure of the setting utterly fucking horrifying and fascinating all at once, and I was surprised how much I liked some of these rather bland characters when it came to their ending closure.

SIBYL is a computer system which controls everything from traffic lights to delivery services. It can read your brain and determine the job best suited for you. It can calculate how likely you’re to commit criminal offences.  If you’re a follower of sci-fi Hollywood cinema then it’s indubitable you’ll think of this as a  mash up of the “Matrix” and “Minority Report.”  I can assure you it’s not the case.  Although the series does draw inspiration from the ilk of the above mentioned movies or books\n          \n        it also presents interesting, innovative plot and technology. \nThe animation is gorgeous; its top notch work so you can’t complain. With this animation the viewers will beg for more action sequences. Fighting scenes are not over the top gravity defying Shonen but are in the convolution of martial arts. \nThe music is exquisite. Opening tracks and ending tracks are full of vibrant colors accompanied with a pumping music which suits the dark setting of the anime elegantly.\nThe show falls short on narration, the first ten episodes are lethargic and commence at a snail’s pace. The biggest flaw is with the narrative are the philosophical ramblings. Lines are quoted from famous literatures but as a viewer they feel obscure, we are unable to fully grasp that philosophical idea.\n\nThe show presents one of the strongest female lead, Akane Tsunemori, who is an intelligent detective and is all for equality and justice. And no, she doesn’t have a huge rack.  She remains true to her character throughout the series. All other characters are left unexplored. There is lack of relationships dynamic between the characters due to which they become unrelatable to the viewers. Motivations behind the actions of the protagonist, Kougami Shinya and the antagonist Makishima Shougo are not properly comprehended. The narrative walks too close to realism making it boring.\n\nThe whole SIBYL system and its functionality remains clouded throughout the series. How are the Cymatic Scans performed? What exactly is Hue? If the system does not take into account the willingness to commit crime does that mean any person with above average IQ will become a latent criminal!? These valid and important questions are not given any space and hence stay unanswered to the viewers.\nUnfortunately great animation does not make up for shoddy narration. \nPsycho Pass  is a onetime watch and  remains a mine of untapped potential. \n        "},

As you can tell by the name, this show probably isn't very light hearted-- I mean you are looking  at a \"Urobutcher\" show.  If you are looking for a suspenseful, plot driven, no-moe-benign-cancer-stricken anime, this is probably a must-see.  \nStory - 9/10\nI give the story a nine because it is complex but easy enough to follow.  My major criticism that prevents\n          \n        it from being a nine is solely on Urobuchi's creative abilities.  If I said it now, it would be spoiler, so I will just say that the plot twist seems awfully similar to Madoka and his later anime, Suisei no Gargantia.\nCharacter - 10/10\nvery little moe-- check.\nArt - 10/10\nThe art of this show is extremely detailed and unique.  You can definitely notice a strong collaboration of production I.G's high budget animation and the artist of Hitman Reborn.  Yeah, there's a ton of good eye candy and well animated fight scenes.  \nSound - 8/10\nSupercell/Egoist does the endings.  They did the opening and endings for Guilty Crown so if you didn't like that, I guess there's something wron--- I mean you're probably not gonna like this either.   My only criticism is that the OST is a little forgettable, and the openings were mediocre in my opinion.\nEnjoyment/Overall = 10/10.  It's an ok show..?  right?\njk really give it a watch.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    Personally, the series started off shaky and had too much action for my liking. Then again, the producers probably thought it would cater to the mainstream and grasp their otherwise short attention span. Other than slightly too many allusions to Philip K. Dick novels, Orwell's and Gibson's names being thrown around in order to sound smart, and not to mention the fact that it borrowed some (or more) ideas from Spielberg's Minority Report, I'd like to say that I enjoyed it. Abstract concepts like law, justice, freedom, peace, beliefs, rights are all included in this futuristic anime. It is not the job of the law\n          \n        to protect the people it affects, but the job of the people of uphold the law for the system cannot work if people do not believe in its merits. \nCharacter development was interesting to say the least. It was entertaining to see a bumbling girl fill out the role of enforcing the law in a city like this. Maybe seeing her shoulder so much in such a short of period of time was a tad unbelievable. I love it when the antagonists are in a morally grey area. Putting audiences in a spot where they aren't sure whether to hate him or not.\nGood job on the lack of romanticism in this anime, I'd hate to see it being lumped in just to fill some episodes even if they weren't related. Also, kudos to Production I.G on the amazing animation. Production quality like this definitely deserves more than just a commendation, although I can't do more. Soundtrack, opening and ending choices were apt as well.\nAll in all, the anime sufficiently encapsulated the core of Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep: the exploration of what it means to be human.

Especially because she's referred to as \"cute\" so many times in the first episode but I found her downright funny looking. It took me a couple episodes to realize that this was a bit tongue in cheek and what makes her cute is how UNcute she is. Even her virtual world avatar is so freaking uncute. \nI always get a kick out of how foreigners pronounce English words. Why put them in there if you're going to mangle them? But I guess it's like Americans that get incorrect kanji tattoos. Just something to deal with. Anyway,\n          \n        this came into play heavily in episodes 4 and 5 when they say the avatar handle \"Spooky Boogie\" over and over with such a weird accent that it's hard to see it as anything spooky or Nightmare Before Christmasy, like it's clearly supposed to be. It just got difficult to take seriously. \nThe male lead is dark, gritty, and so freaking hot. There's an episode where he strips his shirt after exercising and the female lead just stares at him (she even bends over to get a better look at his sweaty abs). You don't see that sort of blatant attraction in anime, even in adult series. Usually it's just blushing, looking around uneasily, or the complete opposite: gettin' it on between almost strangers. Anyway, this was a nice in between. \n\nArt:  A lot of detail went into the art work here. I'm impressed. Most of the time the CG is very well integrated, something you don't see very often. And there are small effects that I appreciate, like when a character is using an itty bitty screen in the background, it still scrolls and lights up, obviously active. Or this little 2 second scene where a character takes a cigarette out of her mouth and it has very detailed lipstick on it. Even the victims, whom we sometimes see for a whopping 5 seconds, are detailed as much as the main characters. There's so much filler in most anime that these little things mean a lot to me as a viewer. Like, I don't feel insulted when they show us background or something insignificant while someone pontificates because what you're looking at is so well thought out.\n\nStory: Subtle things, like the fact that the detectives investigate a missing persons case because the person's TOILET had been reported as unused to the landlord are what make this series great. It isn't just another Big Brother, dystopia show. It took me awhile to get that the people who were \"latent criminals\" were people who had the disposition to do a criminal act. In other words, they hadn't done anything wrong but they were in the mindset to do something about it. Wow! It's like Minority Report but not. It's more about the thoughts and state of mind of the people than future crimes or anything like that.\n"},

The criminal talks a lot of philosophy and I can't keep up with that, so I just dropped it and didn't try to understand that philosophy. The technology is really awesome, you can understand people just by scanning people. I am really amazed with this technology. \nAt the near end of the story, the anime became more and more interesting. The criminal\n          \n        became more unpredictable and more violence, while the police just became a pawn of their superior. This made the protagonist had to work and believe in his own methods. \nThe sound is good, the art is good, the character development is awesome. The story is interesting, but sometime it's boring. So, this anime is good (score 7)\nFor those who wish to watch this anime, prepare yourself. You will need to have a good analyzing skill and understand a little bit philosophy. This anime is great in it's story line and character development. It's a good anime to watch although sometime it's boring... \nTry to watch it.\nPlease enjoy the show.."},

Madoka Magica was incredible, and so was Fate/Zero, but Gen's full abilities can be seen in his vibrant art style, and this series reflects that the best. Dark and gritty with a half-Akira, half-Ghost in the Shell kind of feel, Psycho-Pass is almost immediately indicative of something Gen would want to do. The subtle nuances and interesting direction choices from Naoyoshi Shiotani bring this out very well, making this\n          \n        one of the most thrilling series I've ever seen as well.\nMy favorite thing about this anime, though, is easily its story. A somewhat dystopian future is compounded with a system by Sybil Industries, who are responsible for developing the Psycho-Pass system, a system that gauges the likelihood of a person to commit a crime. In a Minority Report-esque twist, Psycho-Pass is far from perfect, and in many instances, the numbers are skewed by the situation itself, leaving many innocent civilians in danger of running an elevated Psycho-Pass level and accidentally being killed by police officers when they might just need a minute to sit down and sort through things.\nPsycho-Pass is not a challenging anime to watch, but it can be challenging to understand. The character development is executed somewhat awkwardly, especially around the main characters, but this is more than compensated for by its thrilling narrative and, ironically enough, that lack of understanding itself. You start to get drawn in more by what you don't know than by what you do after a while. While this can backfire towards the end of most psychological series, I felt they did an excellent job capping this one off.\nOverall, Psycho-Pass is worth at least a good look. I love this series to pieces, and I know there are at least a few other people out there who will as well.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I had my doubts about watching this anime back in fall, but in the hindsight I have no regrets. For me Psycho-Pass became the sci-fi highlight of the recent years, and definitely one of the better anime of 2012. I can wholeheartedly recommend it to any sci-fi anime lover who is looking for something other than mecha or virtual survival games.\nTo start with, I'd like to emphasize that this anime isn't aimed at younger audience. For once it has quite a display of physical and psychological violence, but moreover it contains quite mature concepts and references to books and media which would more familiar to\n          \n        adults.\nFew words on idea and concept behind it. In essence Psycho-Pass deals with a form of crime prevention, which inevitably draws comparisons with Philip.K.Dick's \"Minority Report\". While both share the similar idea, their practical execution is nothing alike and I strongly believe that it's not fair to call this anime a clone of Minority Report. It's very different. Another similar anime that comes to mind is Ghost in the Shell series: both deal with future cops, investigations and cybercrime. Personally, I found Psycho-Pass easier to watch in a sense that it has less philosophical references, which sometimes overflown in the GiTS.\nNow for the actual review *SPOILERS WITHIN*\nPlot.\nLike mentioned above, Psycho-Pass deals with crime and crime prevention. In the future the cutting-edge technology allowed to create Sybil System, which analyzes scans of  person's bio/cymatic field thus reading into psychological state, natural talents and inclinations, and well the probability of committing crime, a so-called Crime Coefficient. Futuristic cities are equipped with such scanners and so is the police, whose aim is to isolate individuals whose Crime Coefficient is above certain limit (thus being deemed dangerous)....or eradicate them if Sybil System deems them beyond help. The isolated individuals are sent into psychological rehab facilities where they can restore their normal state of mind, while those eradicated poof into a bloody firework. And so on lives the perfect society that knows no violence. But for every perfect system, there is a perfect criminal willing to dismantle it. Even more so when the \"perfect\" system hides nasty secret of its own.\nArt.\nArt is quite delicious. City backgrounds are lovingly done, very reminiscent of those you'd see in GiTS movies. There's plenty of lights and lens effects which add to the ambiance. The overall design is very realistic. You won't see large-eyed heroes with rainbow hair or something; the characters indeed bear strong resemblance to those of Hitman Reborn. Only main female lead stands out like a sore thumb with her deliberately moe appearance. The animation is smooth and lifelike in most of the eps, action scenes feature good flow and a bit of cinematic slowmotion.\n\nSound.\nSound is definitely one of the strongest points of Psycho-Pass. It has excellent OPs and EDs in both seasons, two of which are performed by EGOIST. The sequences themselves are flashy and very stylish with nice 3-color graphics, which became PP's signature (at least for me XD). The soundtrack itself is excellent with some of bone-chilling orchestral pieces (I'll never be able to perceive the Ode to Joy like I did before). I have no complains about voice acting. In my opinion the voices matched all the characters and there was more than enough emotion involved.\n\nCharacters.\nCharacters....lets say while they are a complex bunch with some twists, they are also quite stereotypical. We have a by-the-book-at-all-costs guy (Ginoza), the-ends-justify-the-means guy (Kogami), an old-wise-cop (Masaoka), a light-hearted flirt (Kagari), a lesbian (Yayoi) and many more. Akane, the lead female character may also seem like your typical helpless idealistic girl at first, but I assure you she's not what it seems and in truth she has balls of steel. Makishima, the main bad guy and coincidentally my favorite character, bears strong resemblance to Yagami Light in being that sort of genius villain and that intense bond of opposition he forms with genius cop type, Kogami. \n\nNow the good, the bad, the ugly.\nThe good thing about PP is that it's a fresh idea in the sci-fi anime market which has been drowning with mecha nonsense. It's strongest point is that it's aimed at older audience and therefore it maintains a good balance between gore and mental violence at the viewer, and the latter will keep you on the edge of your seat. The crimes are wonderfully cruel and present interesting philosophical ideas. Having said that, PP is easier to watch in this regard than GiTS where characters' dialogs often times consist of non-stop quoting of various writers and philosophers. PP has it as well, but to a lesser extent. Another strong point is that main character actually shows significant development, something you don't expect at all. Combined with steady pacing, it's quite a successful formula.\nThe bad thing about PP is that there's a very obvious shift in the atmosphere and pacing after the first half of the show. Gradual crimes abruptly reach a peak and much bigger events start taking place, I'd say a little too soon, which cheapens the gritty effect of the first episodes. It almost felt like the original idea for this anime had more episodes than just 22. Another bad thing is the way secondary characters are handled. We get a peak in the past of but a few of them, and in the end they don't bear strong relevance to action events at all. That's not to say that characters are bad though. I really found Makishima a fascinating villain but we never even got to see his personal reasons for committing crimes, or wanting to eradicate the system. Without that story seems incomplete.\nNow for the ugly thing, which is definitely ending. No, it's not hideous or completely Urobutcher-like, or anything. It just doesn't seem to put a full-stop, a dot, to the line of plot. Instead of end of line we've got a metaphysical three dots and story never truly ends. Sure there is some philosophy and hidden message in it too, but honestly would you expect that kind of ending after watching all the episodes? The cycle isn't broken.\nDespite the drawbacks, it's a very solid anime with a nice break from power play, mecha and military. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys GiTS or William Gibson stories. The ending? Just ignore it.\n        "},

It is one of those premises that may be hard to swallow at first and you may find it silly or too unrealistic. However, if you can get past that and take it for what it is I think it is a very deep and thoughtful anime. The anime storyline goes beyond action and crime drama, it explores some very philosophical questions like what is crime? What is justice? How much is a perfect crime-free society worth? Do the needs of the majority outweigh the needs of the few? This anime is able to\n          \n        tackle these questions in a very sophisticated way. The screenplay writer is also very well read and i found that the use of quotations and allusions informed the themes and messages in the story. The actual plot is relatively simple and perhaps a little bit predictable. The ending felt somewhat unresolved and as I understand it they are making a new season. \nArt 8: The animations seemed slightly above average. I found that some of the frames seemed to skip/stutter at a few points in the anime.\nSound 8: I really liked the first intro song but they changed it after episode 11. The rest of the sound is fine but unremarkable.\nCharacter 8. I thought Shinya and Shogo were by far the most interesting and developed characters in the series. Their dynamic was done in a way that seemed almost reminiscent of Yagami Light and L from Death note. Beyond this however, I found some problems with the character development. Akane seemed relatively inconsistent at times and under developed. throughout the series. Many of the other characters served as plot devices in the series. Overall, the primary characters were strong and it's worth seeing the anime for shogo/shinya.\nEnjoyment/Overall 9: Good. Definitely worth a watch.\nMisc:\nBlood/gore: The main gun in the series, the dominator, causes people's heads/bodies to explode in a fashion similar to Kenshiro's attacks from Fist of the North Star. The doesn't glorify violence like Elfen Lied but there are a lot of truly disturbing deaths.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Well, this may be a bit late to post a review on this anime, but well, I'm doing it, since I can really say things that I haven't seen written on most of these reviews, and for that I can assume people have never thought much while watching the great anime Psycho-Pass. \nBut here we go on to the review:\nStory - 9/10\nThis is probably one of the hardest concepts to rate, since it has definitely strong and weak points. First things first, this is a cyberpunk police investigation anime set in almost 100 years from today's time. So, on this alternate future, Japan has isolated\n          \n        itself completely for the entire world, and now runs by a unique system called SYBIL, that messes people's tendency of committing crimes of any kind. This is made through a scale named Psycho-Pass, where a person with a number more than 100 is already someone who'll never be \"normal\" again, and anyone with more than 300 must be eliminated. And now, the police moves on only one weapon, named Dominator, which can only shoot once the person has a Crime Coefficient superior to 100. Up to 300, it only shoots a paralyzer, and if the person aimed at is a psychopath or such, the mode is the Lethal Eliminator, that will shoot to kill, blowing up the person.\nThis is the world in which the anime is set in, and I have to say it is pretty creative how they put Japan as being a completely lonely country that has no contact with the outside. And of course this is made in a pretty logical way. No one can ever leave Japan, while no one can ever enter, because if such happens, maybe the Sybil system would be all over the world, and could be traded in the black market for example. And most interesting of all is that we can notice Japan is getting more isolated throughout time. I don't know if what the anime says can become the truth to Japan far in the future (not due to Sybil and such of course), but who knows.\nBut well, let's just think about the situation: a system that decides if people should die or not, if they should stay in a mental hospital forever or have a normal happy life. That's pretty strange, and if we think closely, every system without exceptions isn't perfect, all of them have one or more flaws. But does the Sybil System has flaws? Well this is up to you to find out by watching the anime. \nAnyhow, the anime has a much deeper meaning than what it seems, especially in the beginning. This happens because it starts with a series of cases which the main characters (detectives - I'll talk about the division later on) have to solve, from a social game mystery to cases where girls were turned into dolls and put on public places as a form of art. And this part I found a bit boring to watch, but of course, still enjoyable and well-scripted. However, when you past half of the episodes, things are going to start getting insane with the appearance of the best character and the one who carried the anime without doubt, whom I'll comment on later.\nWell, the story is not perfect and it falls a bit near the ending of the anime, however it still is really well-written, and, if you're into philosophy and social discussions or critics, you'll surely enjoy the story to its essence, from how the Sybil works to decide who is right and who is wrong in the story.\nArt - 10/10\nFor an anime, I had to give a 10 to Psycho-Pass on the concept of art, since it has definitely the best scenario I've ever seen on any original anime series. Everything is extremely well-thought and detailed, from the buildings to the awesome design of the robots, labs and especially the \"labyrinth\". Every single aspect of the scenario has a function, and is of course extremely creative and detailed as I said before, however, what really out stands is the fact that everything new about the scenario such as holographic rooms and mobile are all straightly related to the Sybil System and how it works out, which is definitely a strong point when I say about the development of the scenario.\nOf course the scenario is the outstanding point in P-P when we talk about art, however the actual characters are also extremely well done. Even though the designer is Akira Amano, known for being the author of \"Katekyo Hitman Reborn!\", a poor manga and anime compared to Psycho-Pass, and the fact that the characters look a lot like the ones from Reborn in some terms; all of them are well made and the designs fit their personalities a lot, and I have to say also that the style chosen for the anime fits very well the dark world it is set in.\nSound - 9/10\nThere's no much to talk about the soundtrack from the anime. It is pretty good and matches perfectly the cyberpunk dark and mysterious world which the anime is set in. I enjoyed some songs a lot, but of course the main theme out stands all the other tracks from the anime, being one of the best themes I've heard in a long while (not only from anime). For the openings and endings, they're all pretty good and also match the style of the anime, but the both the second ending and opening are really better compared to the first ones.\nCharacters - 8/10\nWell... This one was even harder than the story itself. And the fact is that there's a huge problem I found with this anime: the few development of the character's pasts and such made me not care a lot about them in the story. But I didn't dislike any of the main characters, it's just that I couldn't care about what would happen to them, only with one that I will talk about later. But let's get a little more in to the characters:\nThe main protagonist of the series is the newest member of the police, Tsunemori Akane, a twenty year old woman that looks like a teenager. And one thing that is interesting about her is the fact that, even though the anime is based a bit on action scenes and such, her character isn't made to be the \"strong and badass cliche girl\" that we see a lot in almost every game, movie, manga, anime or comic. She is a normal person who has basically the cleanest Psycho-Pass possible (not actually... But I won't give out any spoilers) and is not worried about becoming a latent criminal at all, what makes her Crime Coefficient not rise easily. Her development also doesn't seem forced, and it is made in a pretty cliche but light and good way, at least in my eyes. Her personality also makes her a pretty unique character in relation to most of the ones from the police department, except for the male protagonist, Kogami Shynia, her partner that had a terrible and tragic experience in the past which will be revealed later on. He is determined and seeks for an objective that most people have already put down and forgotten about long ago. He's not much of an interesting character by himself, only when it comes to his way of thinking as a criminal and the intelectual fight against the antagonist.\nSo, here we are, the antagonist... It is indeed hard to talk about him, once it involves lots of spoilers, and I really don't want to give them. So here we go: Makishima Shogo is far, far and far from being a villain. If you finished the anime calling him an annoying villain or a bad guy you should think again about how you see things. Makishima fights for one thing only, and seeks for one thing only. He is definitely the character who carried the story forward, and the one whose absence would have made the anime not good at all. He's also the reason I had to give a \"8\" as the rating to the characters. But one can only know how Makishima is the best character if this one can also think more than what the story objectively says.\nOverall - 9/10\nPsycho-Pass has beautiful art, interesting plot and storyline, a deeper meaning behind the plot itself, and one of the best antagonist I've seen. Overall, this is a must-watch to everyone who enjoys police investigation or wants something to reflect and think while watching. It can be a bit hard for the sensitive ones to watch, since almost every censure has been eliminated from the gore scenes.\nI strongly recommend you Psycho-Pass. Even if the beginning is a bit slow and the conclusion was poor and a bit disappointing, it didn't ruin the anime a lot, and it still is one of the best seinen I've watched so far.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="                          \n    Warning possible Spoilers\nBefore Psycho Pass I had watched every part of the Ghost in the Shell series so I thought this was going to be very similar which it was, but it felt different at the same time.\nIt is the 22nd century and Japan uses the Sibyl System, a programmer used to measure peoples Psycho-Pass to determine whether their mental state has any criminal intent, thus enters Akane Tsunemori a new recruit who has an honest desire to uphold justice.\nNow the story has the complexity of GitS, but it has a different priority because instead of determining whether machines can have emotions instead it focus\n          \n        on the mentality of the human psyche which was incredibly interesting since this a world that even the slightest thought about criminal intents can get you either rehabilitated or killed so it was very entertaining seeing Akane's perspective change over the course of the show as she becomes more experienced to the job and the people she is working for.\nThis show is also much darker compared to GitS considering the deaths caused by the criminals can be pretty damn gruesome and unlike GitS Psycho Pass actually has the balls to kill off characters that are part of the main team which really did surprise me and was pretty said considering the characters they did kill off were pretty good ones.\nAnother interesting thing about the show is how the Sibyl system works as people can no longer decide what jobs they want anymore instead the Sibyl system decides what jobs people have from the scores they get in their educational exams while also taking in the consideration of their mental instability levels and seeing Akane trying to figure out the system lead to some pretty surprising plot twists.\nThe characters were great, GitS only really makes a couple of characters relevant while Psycho Pass actually gives each of the characters a chance to shine in the series.\nThe female MC Akane is definitely a well done character, from the beginning of the series she starts out inexperienced and is unsure where she fits in with the team, but as she experiences more gruesome cases and even loses a few friends along the way by the end she has become a hardened badass, compared to the others she holds dearly to her meaning of justice and desperately tries to change how the missions should be handled making her a very likeable character.\nThe male MC Shinya Kougami is another very interesting character who acts like a hardened douchey Sherlock Holmes because Kougami is incredibly intelligent and helps Akane solve many mysteries, but like all of the enforcement officers he has a dark history with the loss of a previous partner he used to work with and vows to kill his murderer.\nGinoza Nobuchika is the leader of Unit 1 and is a by the book kind of person, but he is also cold and doesn't really get along with the other enforcement officers until Akane came along making him gain a new insight on the enforcement officers and how important they are to the mission.\nTomomi Masaoka is the oldest member of the team and used to be a former detective until the Dominators were brought in which clouded his judgement on how cases should be resolved, being older than the others has also made him a very wise person when it comes to solving crimes and getting involved in gun fights with criminals.\nShuusei Kagari is the jokester of the group and usually makes fun of his teammates most of the time, but when the job gets serious he also gets serious mainly because he hates people who don't take their freedom for granted.\nYayoi Kunizuka and Shion Karanomori are the other female members of the group, Yayoi has a very calm demeanour no matter how bad the situation gets and Shion is an analyst for the Public Safety Bureau and thanks to her some missions would probably have been impossible to solve without her technical skills.\nBut the main villain of the show Shougo Makishima steals it because he is a fantastic villain and it's been a while since I have seen one, I loved how manipulative and ruthless his schemes were to uncover the mysteries of the Sibyl system and he pretty got everyone under his command killed because they ended being boring to him so he just killed them that marks a true villain right there.\nThe artstyle was really well done with the design of the Dominators and the HUD they have it looked very detailed despite them being CGI, I liked how dark and gloomy this world was pretty much shows the constant fear the people have to endure from the harsh reality of the Sibyl system, there was even a point where they went into the virtual reality aspect which didn't look too impressive to me instead it just looked like one weird acid trip.\nIt had great action especially when Kougami and Akane's friend Yuki Funahara were trapped in one of Shougo's dens which felt really hectic with the equipment they had available to them and then there was the final confrontation too which felt very suspenseful and thrilling as you wondered whether everything would be ok, although most of the action moments were pretty quick, but they were still pretty damn good to watch.\nThe show also had a lot of Psychological moments that definitely fu*ked with you're mind especially when it came to understanding the true purpose of Sibyl and what Shougo wanted to unlock from it.\nOverall this was a great first series and if you're a fan of GitS or even Death Note then you will enjoy this a whole damn lot.\n

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Back at it with the tens, me. I'll only really bother to review if I loved it just that much anyway, I suppose.\nBefore I start I will say, anyone who really didn't like Psycho-Pass most likely doesn't appreciate this type of anime in general or didn't get it. That's not an attack on anybody, because even though I enjoyed it, I didn't really get it the first time either.  I'll talk about that later though.\nSTORY: If you're looking for crime mystery, don't look here, is the first thing I'll say. Most (if not all) mysteries are cleared up before you get the chance to\n          \n        think too much on them - that isn't what the story is about.\nTo really appreciate the story, I'm of the opinion that you need to watch it twice. Once to get swept up in the world of Sibyl and watch the drama unfold and probably not really understand the messages behind it; then again to focus on the character developments, interactions, the philosophical discussion and appreciate the relevance of the little things you missed the first time.\nTo me, Psycho-pass is mainly one big philosophical discussion on the value of the law and determining when governance and idealism has gone too far. How much of our free will can we hand over before our humanity is lost? After all, everything is a matter of degree.\nThere's also the theme of human nature itself, but I feel like that ties in with the rest of the discussion.\nART: I love the art in this anime so damn much. Their use of colour in a character's eyes is absolutely splendid for one thing, but more broadly I think the art style matches the tone of the story perfectly. I also really like how Akane's features matched her development without changing her face, and I was quite fascinated actually with how Shinya's face had changed.\nAnother thing would be the 'camera' effects at times - shutter effect, blurring, cutting - all very good stuff that adds to the necessary effect on the audience.\nSOUND: I don't know what to tell you. Sibyl sounds sophisticated as hell and I really like the sound the Dominators make. The use of music is feels like you're watching a movie and that's coming from someone who usually doesn't even notice movie music.\nCharacter: They're so *human*, mate. You might complain about their actions or their attitudes or anything else, but that's because they behave like people. And people do stupid shit, are naive, behave like brats, and all the rest of it all the time - all in the name of how they feel.\nI will say in particular, that I paid more attention to Kagari the second time around and I appreciate what he represents a lot more now. He's not the most interesting character, just one that it's very easy to wrongfully ignore.\nENJOYMENT: It's a serious anime without a doubt. People are dying in horrible ways, fucked up shit's happening, the philosophy and psycho-analysis will no doubt have you rewinding a few times and frankly, if you want something where you don't have to think I'd suggest knocking maybe 3 to 5 points off of this rating in your head.\nIt's not without humour, although it's often quite subtle and what you might describe as 'dry' humour. It made me grin a little, but I won't describe it as being a funny anime.\nEnjoyment will come from how much you're able to immerse yourself in the Sibyl run world.\nOVERALL: I can't say Psycho-Pass will appeal to everyone. It's too gritty and complex for that. It's not something I'd watch purely for fun or even when I was a bit tired. But if you're looking for something a little different to your usual psychological anime, I feel like the Psycho-Pass 'Utopia' provides a whole new platform for analysis and you'll probably love it as much as I do."},

I finished this series three days ago today and am still feeling good about it. The ending (involving Makishima) made me think of Death Note for some reason, but I didn't feel as strongly about it. It felt like a complete ending. I loved the very end, the way it was all wrapped up with a nice little bow. I look forward to watching season 2. I want to see how they execute it.\nMy only problem with this series is Kogami. I feel like he was too...unrealistic for my liking.\n          \n        I mean, granted, he wasn't perfect, which is good, but I didn't like his personality or something about him. However, I loved Ginoza very much. He's my favorite character from this show now. I didn't care much for him in the beginning, but as I learned more about him, I felt better about him. I feel like his mental state shows a very realistic situation in a very stressful environment.\nOverall, this anime was extremely good in my opinion. 10/10.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    Sleek, dark, noiresque sci-fi about a future Japan where everyone’s crime potential is scanned by some infallible, impartial computer system (hint: it isn’t). Our protagonists are government agents who are tasked with implementing the system’s judgment (whether that means arresting someone whose “psycho-pass” level is too high, or killing those who are too far gone). We learn about all these characters and their ideals and their back stories (all of which seem to have been affected by this system). I appreciated that although there a few one-off episodes, all of it is more or less connected to the larger plot arc of the show.\nThe show’s\n          \n        protagonists are in love philosophizing their way through dialogue scenes, bringing up what’s implicit in the action of the show and then commenting on it at length (what is this, a Christopher Nolan movie?) Gen Urobuchi, the show’s writer, also seems to be in love with references; Shakespeare, Rousseau and Terayama are all name-checked at different points throughout the action. Granted, the references are not random, and actually help to illuminate what’s going in the show, but I just thought it was prevalent enough to mention it.\nPSYCHO-PASS’ strengths ultimately is not its philosophical inquiry, but rather its portrayal of the maturation of its lead character from rookie to professional. It’s surprising that that’s what ends up the thing that I take away from the show, and not none of the free will, police state technology shenanigans. It might just mean that the show’s engagement is more shallow than it at first seems. However, this does not prevent the show from being massively entertaining.\ncopied/pasted from my blog: thenextthingblog.wordpress.com\n        "},

However there are also bad sides as well which this anime explains some of the reasons why. I liked the characters i like the action so i get it an 8\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Personally I feel that this anime is close to legendary. \nInitially I thought that it's just going to be another depressing story, and I found the first few episodes to be a little bit slow. But as the story progresses, it gets better and better. If you feel like dropping the series midway, I suggest that you don't. Watch the entire thing and you will see the story unfold itself into a mind-blowing experience that urges you to reflect on your personal and societal values. \nHowever, despite finding it outstanding, I can't deny that this anime can be highly disturbing, as it's chock-full of unimaginable\n          \n        cruelty. The people are mentally fragile and when they lose control of themselves, they become capable of extreme evil. At first, the crimes may seem pretty commonplace, but they'll become crueler and crueler until you wouldn't be able to take it anymore! If you can't stand violence you should probably stay away from this anime =\\ The violence is not meant to be a bad influence though; not only does it advance the plot, it also raises questions about humanity for us to consider. \nI feel that the art is superb, as it creates a cold and impersonal atmosphere befitting of a highly advanced futuristic society. The environment looks stunning, and the city almost seems to have a dual nature of its own: a lovely city full of shiny elegant skyscrapers by day, an intimidating metropolis filled with kaleidoscopic neon lights and seedy sleazy streets by night. Character-wise: one rather funny thing I noticed is that all the characters are pretty pale, except for Tomomi Masaoka, who is quite tan, but of course that's beside the point -- each of them still looks genuinely and not pretentiously cool!\nThen there's the voice acting. I think the seiyuus did a really good job, as all of their voices are so in tune with their characters that they actually sound pretty realistic and not in the least bit theatrical. Particularly Akane Tsunemori, who is supposedly the adorable demure looking girl. She could have easily sounded like the typical whiny helpless female, but she doesn't (thanks to her surprisingly strong character). \nOne thing I don't really favor is perhaps the OPs and EDs, but that's only because I'm not really into that kind of music :P Nonetheless, I guess they suit the anime's various themes of anarchy, insecurity and such.  \nThe characters are all very likeable, especially Masaoka, the fatherly figure of this anime. Shinya Kogami is such a hunk -- and a ridiculously intelligent one too. I find him a bit too frighteningly perfect. I feel that the characters can use a bit more development, as it was only done fairly. It would be nice if there's a background story for Shuusei Kagari, like that of Yayoi Kunizuka. This would have made us relate more to each of the characters. Then again it's not like it's necessary. \nTo end off, it would be a bit wrong to say that the anime is 'enjoyable', as I didn't actually enjoy all the extreme violence. *But YES! Even so, the whole thing IS indeed enjoyable.* I was overcome by suspense, curiosity, anticipation and even hope. I was also filled with woe at one point when tragedy struck, so much so that I was moved to tears. The whole series was an emotional ride for me, reminding me why I'm into such dark animes: they make me feel human once more. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

It has wonderful characters, each one with a personality you can relate too and/or admire. The antagonist shogo, is even someone i consider amazing, because i can understand him. In fact, the show may even make you wonder who the real antagonist is. The sibyl system( which judges people) will even make you relate because it is something that could happen in the real world and also something that is technically happening right now. (though not to any extreme like in the show). The story started\n          \n        off a little slow, but i think around episode 4 or 5 it got really good, and i could literally not wait for it to come out every week. It is very new(2013) so the animation is fantastic, and is short enough to watch in a week or so depending on how often you watch a series. But this one is worth watching so add it to your list if you haven't cause you'll regret it. \n        "},
