I would like to have a daughter like her xD.\nShe is always laughing, and when she gets scared she is really cute. She also learns things\n          \n        really fast but misunderstoods them most of the time, and that's what it makes she so funny, that, and that sometimes she says things that you would never believe a child would say.\nThe other characters are mostly for Yotsuba's support, but they are unique too, and very different from each other.\nThe art is really simple, but cute and clean. Like Azumanga Daioh, from the same creator.\nSo, I recommend you this manga if you want to read something happy and lively.\nEnjoy life and enjoy Yotsuba& :]"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=130,  ["text"]="            \n    This ongoing manga is basically a story about the life of 5 year old Yotsuba and her day to day experience. For those who have seen or read Azumanga Daioh I'd expect you'll immediately be able to make the connection between the similar story plots and artwork, and you'd be right to make this connection because its made by the same mangaka, Kiyohiko Azuma. Like Azumanga Daioh there is no real 'plot progression' (it lost points for story), but thats not really a bad thing if you like this style. Unlike Azumanga Daioh, where stories are told in short panel strips, Yotsubato! is complete chapters,\n          \n        and occasionally several chapters for one story. \nStory: As I already said there isn't much of a 'story,' but each experience she has is cute. Many of the stories are extremely humorous. If you're looking for drama or action this definitely IS NOT the story for you. Most gags are based on Yotsuba's lack of understanding because she's just a little girl or her overactive imagination. There is a small plot somewhere; 'She was adopted from somewhere far to the 'left.' Thats pretty much it...\nArt: The art is simple, but perfect for this type or writing in my opinion. Its not a master piece, but it doesn't need to be. As longing as you get the cuteness across its fine. \nCharacters: While Yotsuba is in my bias oppinion is the most interesting character;  there are many other humorous persons in the story, such as; her dad, her dad's friends, and neighboring girls. Unlike Azumanga Daioh!, where there isn't really a main character, Yotsuba is definitely the central character of this story. \nEnjoyment: If you like cute stores like this I'm possitive you'd love this. Most stories are 100% enjoyment. \nOverall: I don't know why I'm giving it an 8, it would be a 10 in my book~ \nIts not 'perfect,' but as far as the genre goes its pretty close. Its one of those espically cute, ironic manga that most people, even not interested in this genre would love. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=44,   ["text"]="             \n    This is probably one of the funnyist manga's I have ever read. For one, Yotsuba is a good character that really makes the story come alive. Along with this, the other characters add to the story and makes Yotsuba's adventures even better to read. No matter how many times I read it, I loved it each and every time. What this manga does is unlocks the inner child within you and makes you remember all the fun and stupid things you did when you were little. The art, don't make me get started on that! It was in one word, captivating. Even without color, the\n          \n        pictures still come alive and you can still imagine what they would be like in real life.The only bad point or flaw would be that there isn't much deep meaning to it. It is mostly meant to laugh, but it dosent get you to think as much, which to me, is important for an anime. That brought the story down a bit, but overall, this is a fun manga to read. I would totally tell all my friends about this too!!!\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=20,   ["text"]="           \n    There are slice of life mangas that focus on building and showing the relationships between the main characters, in this case a parent - child relationship, as with titles such as Usagi Drop or Taiyou no Ie. Then there is Yotsubato!, a manga which main premise lies in narrating and displaying the daily life of the child and the different interactions with her surroundings, all represented hilariously.\nThe story of Yotsubato! is simple: Yousuke Koiwai, the parent, and Yotsuba, the 5-year-old child, move to a new neighbourhood, living next to them a family composed of three girls and their parents. The author proceeds to narrate different\n          \n        everyday life events of Yotsuba, who is a very curious girl and ignorant of her surroundings. This is displayed masterfully, in conjunction with the art style: it is presented in such manner that it makes these situations very hilarious, as well as very relatable to your own childhood or that of your own family.\nOne thing that I missed in the story is the fact that it hardly focuses on the characters background at all, neither on the relationship development of the other characters, beside that of Yotsuba. Little hints to the background stories and relationships are introduced slowly, which leaves the reader yearning to know and explore more about it. The mostly episodic nature of the manga makes it difficult to really convey a feeling of \"continuity\" to the manga, but this is nevertheless a small drawback, which at the same time enhances the narrative of it.\nThe characters in Yotsubato are well carved and presented. Yotsuba clearly represents childhood, which is displayed through infinite curiosity and energy, absurd lies to escape punishment, honest, direct thinking, childhood innocence, which makes it so relatable. Other element which further enhances her personality is the fact that she is clueless of most modern things, even infancy games. \nThe cast of characters in Yotsubato! is large, but varied. There is Youtsuba's father Yousuke, who works for an unknown job at home, his friend Jumbo the giant florist, Yasuda who Yotsuba dislikes. Then the family next door: Ena, the smart and conscious one; Fuuka, your average highschool girl, and the cool sister Asagi. Not to forget the stern grandma. As the story progresses, the author reveals how their personalities are, as well as introducing new characters.\nThe art style of Yotsubato! complements well with the narrative of the manga, as well as displaying through simplistic facial expressions of Yotsuba her emotional state and how the other characters are affected. The art is consistent with stunningly realistic backgrounds, as cars, houses, room designs, you name it, which really came as a surprise.\nYoutsubato! was overall a very enjoyable experience, whose narrative was well presented, with hilarious gags, as well as being very relatable to the reader. The lack of character's background story, and relationship development of the side characters may be a drawback for some, but this is compensated with the heartwarming and hilarious moments the manga has to offer. There was literally no chapter in which I didn't laugh. Recommendable to anyone with an interest in slice of life or comedy genre.\nThank you for reading."},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=25,   ["text"]="          \n    Yotsuba&! is the story about Yotsuba Koiwai, a five-year-old girl who stays at home with her dad. She has no mom and is too young to go to school yet. Yotsuba is a cute girl with green (yes green) hair that’s done in four pigtails, giving her the appearance of a four-leaf clover (\"yotsuba no kurōbā\" in Japanese), and thus her name. 4channers may recognize her as the website’s unofficial mascot.\nThe manga is by Kiyohiko Azuma who also created Azumanga Daioh. The similarities between these two are very apparent, and the style of humor is the same, so if you liked Azumanga Daioh, then you\n          \n        don’t want to miss reading Yotsuba&!.\nSimilar to Azumanga Daioh, you’ll meet lots of new characters as the series progresses, mostly Yotsuba’s friends and neighbors, and they are all almost as odd as she is. XD My two favorite characters are Mr. Koiwai and Fuka Ayase. Mr. Koiwai is Yotsuba’s father. I aspire to be like him when I have my own daughter. He’s kind and is always there to take care of Yotsuba, but at the same time he makes sure she behaves properly (not so easy for a five-year-old). Fuka Ayase is 16-years-old and the middle sister of the Ayase family, who lives next-door to Yotsuba. Fuka is creative and smart, and she is the vice-president at school, but she also gets flustered really easily.\nYotsuba&! is a slice-of-life series, through and through. When I thought about slice-of-life, I used to think about Azumanga Daioh or Lucky Star, but none of them capture the little joys and perks in life as well as Yotsuba&! does.\nIn the manga you’ll follow Yotsuba to the bike store, the zoo, and much much more, all while seeing what life is like through the perspective of an eccentric five-year-old. It is funny reading Yotsuba's unusual but completely innocent remarks about things such as global warming and cicadas. Yotsuba will say and do the darndest things, and despite her bratty side which appears from time to time, you can’t help but adore her.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="            \n    \"Today is always the most enjoyable day.\"\nComedy always was and will always be a double-edged sword. Either you burst out laughing, laying waste to the nearest furniture in the meantime, you get what you came for or you only manage to grin faintly at best... the summoned feelings can differ significantly between two otherwise similar persons. You don't need to be an expert to find out about this swing of feelings when searching for something fun to read/watch.\nBut one comedy genre stays out of this top-or-flop cycle, since it deals with themes we all are quite aware of or had been in the past and\n          \n        where we will almost always inner agree; the adventures of being a child.\nThe starting quote, basically being the leifmotif of the manga in question here, sums up a certain child's life perfectly. You surely recognized by now: this child is named Yotsuba and the manga deals with her everyday adventures.\nSeeing our today's world through the eyes of a kid... what can there be to it, you may ask? No, do not think of an ordinary farmer's girl or one living in a wealthy mansion. \nThink differently!\nDirect your thoughts into the mind of a young girl coming to town for her first time. How will you process all the impressions you perceive? Are you actually overwhelmed? Does curiosity seize you completely? Close your eyes for a short moment and try it... Imagine...\n...\n......\n.........\n............\n...............\n............\n.........\n......\n...\nSo, what have you seen? Maybe a great shopping mall, an awesome articulated bus, wide streets or huge crowds of all kind of humans? Have you deeply inhaled this air of novelty into you?\nNow, you are prepared to attend Yotsuba on her efforts to understand and enjoy her upcoming life.\nFollowing are some thoughts I have to direct to her:\n*\nYotsuba, what a crazy and inquisitive five-year-old child you are. You do not need many dialogues to demonstrate your outgoing character, you gain new friends in no time, you face your goals head-on. \nEven with tiny things which adults tend to overlook; you will find a possibility to make the most out of them.\n*\nBut what I admire most about you, Yotsuba, is your sheer ability to make every new experience an adventure, thus sharing some kind of life consultation with us. You show us how to not hold back in front of unknown places and conquer new life areas with lots of curiosity to receive an everlasting memory. Seriously, many people of today's society could learn a lesson from you and your pureness. Or, to put it into your father's words: \"Kids really can jump into things without holding back.\"\n*\nYotsuba, in addition to your adorable nature, you are really fortunate to have such a supporting folk around you. Be it an adrenalin pushed dance with your daddy, your visits next-door (you sure don't get bored of them) or you curious talk with a random shop clerk, you will definitely remember them for their unexpected helpfulness in guiding you through a world of infinite potential. \"We really live in amazing times\", Torako says, and it definitely seems so for you; every day is another amazing one.\n*\nI'm not overdoing it by giving her this much credit. She really deserves all the given attention. Now, beside her memorable character, let me mention another point which distinguishes Yotsuba's life from other children based comedies: While other works may work with forced and somewhat cheesy punchlines at a chapter's end, this comedy always keeps its human nature and won't exaggerate (it doesn't have any need to in the first place), which will let you smile and enjoy her life even more.\nYou know, smiling and laughing have a much deeper meaning in life than you probably would have thought. Are you actually aware of why Japanese people have such a high life expectancy? It's partly because they laugh a lot, not only to jokes, but also to issues where other cultures would rather look away or might feel offended. I've recently watched an interview with three Japanese centenarians stating exactly this matter of laughing as their main reason why they live on. No wonder they became this way, since they can enjoy such splendid comedy manga their whole life along without any problems like ceasing replenishment of fresh works.\nIn addition, if they had grandchildren like Yotsuba, what other things would there be to wish for? For myself, I'm able to admit without a doubt that having a child like Yotsuba would greatly increase the value of my life. Seriously!\nYotsuba... so why is this manga actually called Yotsubato? The \"to\" after her name means \"and\" in English. \"Yotsuba and...\"; It has been Yotsuba and me for a long time now, and I hope that in the near future, we can proudly say: \"Yotsuba and you\"."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="           \n    Childhood sure has its perks. You get to create mischief without any lasting repercussions, will find amusement in the most trivial of endeavors, are gifted sweets from loved ones who seek to see your cheerful smile and a piggy back ride from those who tower over you. But most of all, every waking moment is a period of grand adventure as your mind is no different from a sponge soaking in the nuances of this world that is so new to a developing conscious being. Five year old Yotsuba Koiwai is the child that many of us have resembled at some point in our lives,\n          \n        and it is vicariously through her that we readers are able to recall a simpler time and place where life was a neverending joyful experience\nIt is the simplicity of Yotsubato that makes it such a successful manga, describing the day by day excursions of an adorably naive little girl who's strong sense of wonder creates a windfall of comedic and lighthearted moments. This type of premise may lack complexity in comparison to many other critically acclaimed manga out there, but what it lacks in a coherent linear story it makes up for in sheer realism & relatability, as everyone can sympathize with a little trouble maker whether its a past version of themselves or a family member. Yotsubato is a slice of life in its very truest sense.\nThe art style is not intricate by any sense of the imagination, and yet serves its purpose in creating a relaxing atmosphere where the characters are not meant to be taken seriously. Yotsuba has an incredible array of facial expressions in her arsenal depending on her mood, and they help to drive home the funniest moments in the manga. It is particularly my favorite when there are multiple panels side by side showing her gradually decaying demeanor. From shock, to discomfort, to a tearful bawl that while not funny to her, is absolutely hilarious to everyone else almost purely because of the way that she is drawn.\nWhile the manga does largely revolve around Yotsuba's everyday adventures there are many other characters unique from one another who serve as perfect complements to her character. A doting guardian who tries his hardest to steer his child into the right direction, the next door neighbors in the Ayase family who serve as her second home where she constantly barges in to play with the youngest child and her sisters. Her fathers friend Jumbo who is akin to an uncle, and she even has a nemesis in family friend Yanda who teases her to no end. \"NEVER, EVER COME BACK\" she exclaims to a departing Yanda who steals her candy, bowl of ramen and ice cream all in one afternoon. Their numerous battles are but a short sample size of how well these characters interact with each other.\nEach and every chapter without fail has been an absolute riot thus far. I've laughed, cried (from the laughter) and felt the pangs of post manga depression after completion of the latest volume as I lie eagerly in await to continue Yotsuba's journey. They say its important to relish a childhood that you'll never get a chance to repeat twice, and yet I feel as though I've been granted the opportunity to revisit my own through the prism of a little girl who serves as the embodiment of childhood itself. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="           \n    Yotsuba is a manga about parenting that is actually the only thing from Japan that makes me laugh. It's not easy to see simplicity and quality so close to each other. But what does an episodic series about an energetic girl and her friends' adventures have of special? In terms of story, the jokes are so ingenious and simple it makes you wonder how it is possible. Seriously, the number of visual jokes that are not overused and actually work several times is astonishing. No surprise I feel so good while reading it, it explodes of so much genuineness contained in it. That's because the\n          \n        pandering is so little and the depiction is, albeit fun, very mature. As a father, I feel extremely happy in see characters acting how I would act in such a situation, at least in most of them. Even though the events in Yotsuba are quite surreal, the way the father acts towards his child is so real, always being indirect and kidding in a way to soften the learning process. He's not afraid of being honest and acting more like a friend than just a guardian. That's something that makes all the difference in any parenting story. Not all parents are ideal or paranoid and for a manga focusing on comedy, I'm impressed on how realistic certain interactions are, certain reactions and decision-making. The characters are slowly introduced and their interactions are so genuine and straightforward it amazes me beyond belief. Yotsuba is a manga for everyone to read, it's inspirational, it raises your spirit, it can make you laugh a lot and even tear a bit depending on your level of relatability, even more if you're a parent.\nYotsuba = genuine af.\nThe paneling is so clean and limpid it makes it the easiest manga to read ever. So simple in structure, each panel mathematically separated on the pages and flowing so naturally, juicy. The character design is a bit generic, but Yotsuba is THE symbol of simplicity and cuteness. No one gets even close to her, not even Barakamon's trademark Naru. She's just that little kid you want to hug until the end of times and her faces are the best, diverse and not overly dramatic. It's just, genuine. That's the word.\nWanna get inspired? Wanna smile and feel joy because of some cartoonish little girl and her daily adventures? I can't think of anything to recommend besides this. It's the most genuine and actually good lighthearted manga I've read so far. The End.\n        "},

Although their isn't much of a story, the way it is told is Fun (or for Yotsuba SUPER FUN^_^), Funny, Crazy, Cool, and Heartwarming. The only story right now is that Yotsuba moved into a new neighborhood from somewhere \"waaaaaaay over there\". Of course, the way it is told makes it so that you don't really need a plot or anything like that. Just \"enjoy everything\" like Yotsuba.\n\nArt\n          \n        10/10\nThe Art for this manga was SPECTACULAR. Everything, even without color, was drawn very beautifully and realistically. From the characters expressions to even the smallest details, are believable and enjoyable to look at. The covers for each volume are like paintings,they are precious, you never get tired of looking at them, and they are filled with life. \n\nCharacter 9/10\nYotsuba, the main character,discovers new things and makes new friends everyday. She is a fascinating kid, with such a air of cuteness, curiousity, and child-like innocence (she is a child of course^_^) that you can't help but like her, and to wanna have fun with her.Whether she is visiting her neighbors, or discovering what a swing is, or being flower cupid and giving everyone flowers. She reminds us of how fun and magical it was to be 6-years old and to have those many adventures and discoveries rather than resorting to\"grown-up things\"(cigarettes, video games, computers, and such). And it is a wonderful part of our childhood that most of us end up forgetting about or putting aside, but Yotsuba has us remember those times and we awaken our inner child. And then we begin to enjoy life again.She is truely a wonderful character (heck, i like her enough to care for her as if she was a real person^_^).\nThe side characters such as her friends Ena, Fuuka, and Asagi are also fun and interesting. Yotsuba is the main spot-light most of the time, but it is nice to see the different interations and relationships these people have with Yotsuba and how they act outside of that. It's also interesting to slowly learn thier history, because Yotsuba doesn't have much of a history as this point besides the fact that use to live on a tropical island \"waaaay waaaaay left.... and a little right\"^_^. Although some would argue that these characters are not as important as Yotsuba, i think they are all important in some way as they add something to the story and they care and support yotsuba as friends and as a family.\n\nEnjoyment-9/10\n So far, i have enjoyed Yotsuba&! very very much. I never get tired of her or any of her friends or realitives. Each adventure has given me something to enjoy and learn about life and about Yotsuba and her friends. Yotsuba&! gives me more reasons to enjoy my life every time time i read a new volume. It is truely a wonderful endless adventure and one that will never leave me. I love you, Yotsuba^_^. \n\nOverall-9/10\nFor anyone who wants a light, warm, fuzzy, slice of life/comedy manga, I would highly recommend Yotsuba&! Even if you dont read that sort of stuff, you will surely enjoy this story in one way or another. Just lie down, relax, pick up Yotsuba&!, and enjoy.(Once i read a few more volumes, my ratings will most likely change from 9 to 10)\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="             \n    To be completely honest, the slice of life genre never really appealed to me. I didn't understand what was so riveting about watching people do ordinary things, things we do and see every day. I don't know what in the world made be pick up Yotsuba&!, because what could possibly satisfy me out of a slice of life?\n...Lots, actually.\nWhat I didn't realize is that what makes the slice of life genre come alive are the characters. It relies on the characters to make new, insightful, or hilarious observations of the mundane and turn ordinary situations into something unique, or at least look at them from\n          \n        a different perspective. Seeing as how our protagonist is a five year old girl, there's sure to be some very interesting observations and unique situations. Yotsuba is lively, energetic, quirky, and innocent, and she finds out more and more about the new world around her, bringing enjoyment (and sometimes exasperation) to her family, friends, neighbors, and all she encounters. Now, the reason I love Yotsuba could be that I love the way little kids behave and respond to the world, but that doesn't mean she's the only interesting character. Her dad is eccentric, Jumbo and Fuuka are funny, and everyone has chemistry when they're around one another. Their interactions are priceless.\nAll in all, this series is fantastic because the characters are. Even if you aren't a fan of slice of life, give this one a try. It's got to be nearly impossible not to love Yotsuba.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="               \n    Yotsuba&! is a great slice-of-life that follows the main character Yotsuba enjoying her day to day life. There's a lot of wacky moments which I feel make the manga even better. Almost always Yotsuba is learning and experiencing something new so there's never a lack of surprises (Yotsuba reacting to a scarecrow for example). It's really easy to follow and the art style is really easy on the eyes. I suggest you read Yotsuba&! if you are into slice-of-life since theres no action or mystery. That would also lead me to say, don't expect the manga to be too serious, the way characters react to\n          \n        certain situations or shenanigans gives off a more comedic atmosphere. I sincerely suggest you read the lighthearted manga known as Yotsuba&!.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="           \n    Story: It's the story about a 5-year-old girl completely new to the world. She meets new people and experience new experiences with each passing day. You don't see that everyday in anime, do you? But I'll also say this manga has no plot. I'll say a 8/10.\nArt: The art is good, isn't that unique but somehow is unique. It's good for this type of anime. 8/10\nCharacter: The character personalty and how they change (and of course, why) is clear and the characters are amazing. All of the characters, especially Yotsuba, are interesting in their own way, Yotsuba with her newbie-ness to the world, and there\n          \n        comes more. 10/10 here.\nEnjoyment: If you're looking for pure comedy and no drama/action, you'll definitely enjoy this manga. 9/10\nOverall: 8/10. It'll be a 10/10 in my book though...\nRecommended for: Anyone looking for a comedy manga with no story, it seems like.\nNot recommended for: Like I said previously, it's not recommended for people looking for a drama/action manga.\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="          \n    So far there are 11 volumes of Yotsuba&! and I've really enjoyed reading them all.\nStory: \nThere isn't a specific storyline to this manga, it follows the life of 5 year old Yotsuba and her daily life. What I like about this manga is that because it's centred around Yotsuba,who is a small child and this brings back happy memories of being a younger child myself.\nThere isn't too much dialogue, and things are nicely spaced out so it's fresh and easy to read.\nThere is lots of random humour, a lot based around Yotsuba's lack of understanding (as she's still growing up and learning). Also other characters\n          \n        have their random outbursts too (especially her dad). So I find this manga perfect as something to lighten the mood if I had a bad day.\nThe little \"slogan\"/\"motto\" of this manga is very simple but has a very good meaning. \"Enjoy everything\"\nThe manga takes lots of simple everyday things and shows it to Yotsuba who still has to learn about these things. \nFrom Greetings to Bubbles and taking pictures on a camera, seeing these through Yotsuba and her reactions to new things are fun to read about.\nArt:\nIt's a very simple art style, which helps to create the light and happy mood. \nHowever the background art is AMAZING at times. It looks so simple yet it feels so detailed. It really suits the feel of the manga and I think, if it was too detailed in the art, then the mood would drop a little.\nI have noticed there is a slight change in the art style (comparing volume 1 to volume 11) but there isn't anything wrong with it.\nCharacter:\nCharacter designs are simple and rather plain but since this is a slice-of-life, I guess that's just how we are. So we can't really complain.\nNone of the characters are too detailed in their backgrounds and personalities, everything is pretty simple so it's easy to pick out who's who and what to expect.\nYotsuba (the main character) is really cute, I find her really funny and author did a good job of making her seem child-like.\nThough I am surprised that her next door neighbours aren't annoyed that Yotsuba seems to freely go to their house and let herself in. (Maybe it's because she's 5, I'm not sure)\nThere isn't anything very special about the characters, they all are likeable one way or another.\nEnjoyment:\nSince there isn't anything \"heavy\" about this manga, its perfect for comfort reading or if you just need a little cheering up.\nThere are parts which make me laugh really loudly without meaning to, so I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!\nOverall there is nothing I actually dislike about this manga, it's been a joy to read! I hope you enjoy it too!\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="           \n    Yotsubato! is a slice of life comedy manga. It revolves around a five-year old girl exploring her neighborhood and just being very cute! \nThe story is nice, its about a little girl who moved to a new neighborhood, and you might start thinking it will be very mediocre and weird thing will happen, then BAM! she turns out to be something she never knew she was. the fact that she is adopted just raises your doubts, but its totally the opposite. \nI really like the art, and how they make Yotsuba pop out more that the others, with her green hair and how she looks\n          \n        less realistic than the others. Its very cute, and i love the way Kiyohiko Azuma-san draws hair! His colour scheme is also something i adore. although im not very fond the way he draws eyes. they seem a bit empty to me...\nEach of the characters have a very odd and cute personality. Kowai, Yotsuba's dad is very childish, but serious when he needs to be. Their neighbors, Fuuka and her family are also very interesting. Enna, the youngest, is very gentle and sweet. Fuuka, the middle sister, is a typical teenage, worried about looks and love , but she is still a child at heart. NAd of course, our main character! the quirkiest, funniest, and cutest in my opinion. she is called starnge by everyone, even her own father!\nI enjoy reading Yotsuba, it always makes me laugh. Though there are some jokes that leave me pondering, it is still funny. I like how everyday something new happens, and how it doesnt only look at Yotsuba. \nI hope this review has been helpful, im not really good at these! \nThank you for reading!\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="          \n    When I first read Yotsabato!, I expected it to just be an innocent little kids' manga, with some childish jokes thrown in. I was wrong. It's actually possibly one of the funniest mangas I've ever read.\nStory: 6/10\nIf you're looking for a great story, sorry, Yotsubato! is not the place to go. It's got an episodic storyline, with no proper plot, but I guess that's just what you'd expect from a comedy. There is the mystery of Yotsba's origins (she's adopted), but not much attention is drawn to that.\nArt: 8/10\nThe art has a similar feel to a Disney movie; the characters are drawn simply, but look\n          \n        polished, and the scenery perfectly captures city life.\nCharacter: 8/10\nThe characters all have their own personalities and quirks. Most of them, particuarly Yotsuba, look rather cute. \nEnjoyment: 9/10\nThis manga is actually pretty funny. If you don't mind mostly all-age humour, you will probably enjoy this manga. I was also quite charmed by Yotsuba's adorable personality.\nOverall: 8/10\nNice art, great humour and sweet characters. A great slice-of-life manga. \n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="          \n    Yotsuba&!(Or Yotsubato!) is a relaxing manga. It doesn't have any crazy plotlines or stories, it's just very simple, cute, and silly. Plus, it's the sort of manga you can kind of jump in at any time, in any chapters, you don't really have to stress about reading it from beginning to end(Although, I'd still recommend reading it in order, it's just, if you happen to find, say, volume 5 at the library or book store, but not the first ones, you wouldn't have to get all freaked out about that). The character designs are original but not overwhelming.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="            \n    Funny in an innocent way, very cute, and sugary sweet without being sickening.  \nEach story in Yotsuba! doesn't last very long, but for the most part is self-contained and modular.  There is no barrier to entry here, you won't feel left out if you haven't seen or read X, Y, or Z, and what specific references there are aren't the focus of the stories, they're just window dressing.  Parodies exist, but exist accessibly.  A 5 year old could follow along.\nI can't recommend this enough for anyone looking for low-stakes slice of life enjoyment.  Plot progression is nonexistent, art is endearing\n          \n        though not groundbreaking.  Dialog shines here: the author has done a great job of capturing what makes people think kids are cute and turning that up to 20.\nPick this up as soon as you need something that just makes you feel good.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="               \n    Just catch up with the last chapter available of Yotsuba! It was such a good ride. Funny to see that someone that drew demon hentai can do a series with such good character writing, comedy and continuity. The series is about Yotsuba finding out how life is, how things work out, of a kid trying to do good things and almost all of the times fucking up, it's so relatable i could see myself as a kid in the place of Yotsuba.\nThe comedy is just pure gold, i have never laughed out so bad in my entire life as i did reading it. There's a\n          \n        lot of mystery under Yotsuba too, we know some stuff about her and her father, her family, but that's not the main focus of it, the focus of the series its Yotsuba herself. The secondary characters are amazing, they're funny as hell and the author draws some really cute characters.\nA shame that it takes so long to release new chapters, the series started in 2004 and until now we only have 96 chapters.\nYou guys should check it out sometime if you have some spare time. \n        "},
