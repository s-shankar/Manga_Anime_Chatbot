Named Rakka for the dream of falling she had while inside the cocoon, she soon becomes accustomed to life in the strange town. However, there are strict rules for the Haibane, such as being forbidden to leave the village or go near the walls surrounding it. These, along with mysterious disappearances of their kind on their \"Day of Flight,\" begin to unsettle Rakka and the others since they know almost nothing about their own kind. Haibane Renmei tells not only Rakka's story but also of those around her, as they live their lives with no memories of the past while trying to break free from their former pain and ultimately find salvation.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=562,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    This is the most striking anime I've ever seen. The care and imagination that went into every aspect of the show is remarkable, but due to the slow, gentle nature of the series I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, if only because this isn't a typical anime in terms of plot. The suspense is subtle -- difficult to spot if you're watching it for the first time -- and builds up over half of the series. Haibane Renmei starts off languid and mysterious, and it tapers off just as languid and mysterious, and every episode seems to reveal more questions that never get answered. Even\n          \n        with the sudden spike in conflict later in the series, most of it is internal.\nDon't be fooled by the angel-like appearance, by the way. Religion has nothing to do with this anime, and ABe has said before that it's a purely aesthetic choice, though some do feel that there's symbolism involved.\nThat said, it's provocative and heartbreaking and dreamlike. Pacing is slow, but expertly done. You'll find that one episode transitions easily into the next. And so much of the story is implied... as well as character backgrounds and the like.\nIts art doesn't try to wow the viewer, and it seems content to just let the setting and soft colors and unique character designs speak for themselves. The backgrounds are gorgeous and detailed. Characters' personalities are mild and realistic; no character gets shoved into the standard archetypes you so often see in anime.\nAlso notable is the soundtrack. Every song fits the mood of Haibane Renmei perfectly -- especially notable (aside from the opening, \"Free Bird,\" and ending theme \"Blue Flow\") are \"Garasu no Yume,\" \"Ailes Grises,\" \"Starting of the World,\" and \"A Little Plate's Rondo.\" Many of them feel like lullabies. Personally, the soundtrack is one of my favorite parts of this series, but looking at the other reviews, it looks like I'm the only one who finds it so breathtaking. Your mileage may vary.\nIt begins by letting the viewer into the peaceful simplicity of daily life in Glie, allowing insight into the setting and the minor characters, but it grows into a story about friendship and letting go and guilt and forgiving yourself and so much more. The climax of the story is likely to make you cry or cringe or suck in your breath -- maybe all three.\nAt times depressing and at times gently uplifting and feather-soft, Haibane Renmei is unparalleled in beauty, and I wouldn't hesitate to call it my favorite anime of all time.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=292,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    It wouldn&rsquo;t be an exaggeration to say that a large number of anime fans have encountered Yoshitoshi Abe or the shows he&rsquo;s created and worked on, nor would I be wrong to say that he has gained a strong fanbase for his beautiful art and creative vision. Many people were turned off by the gritty confusion that was Serial Experiments Lain (one of his previous works), but there were a still few willing to dive into Haibane Renmei despite the previous title's flaws. In his debut as a writer, Yoshitoshi Abe envisioned and penned an anime series that quietly tugs at the heart and that\n          \n        has carved its own place in the anime medium with its unique charm. Like most things, the show is not for everyone. Although it is a solid work that should be at least enjoyed by most of its potential audiences, for those of us who, like I, find themselves yearning for a show that will sweep them away into another world and enchant them, it can easily become more of an experience than just a work of entertainment.\nOne of the first things a viewer will notice when watching this series, is the visual and artistic style with which it is produced. Although the animation does not excel on any technical level, with occasional distortions and simplifications in the cel work, it certainly gets the job done and is more than made up for in the other artistic elements. The background artwork is detailed, scenic and fits the tone of the series perfectly. The character designs are simple but memorable and attractive, particularly Rakka. Most importantly, the series is washed in a soft, water-coloured style that gives it a subtle dream-like quality. The audio aspects of production were also strong, but, especially in the case of the score music, did not excel. Kou Otani (who recently did the score for Shana) handled the music and created a score that was engaging but ultimately forgettable. The main problem is likely that a real orchestra and instruments were not used to create the music, and although her synthetic compositions are strong, the sound ultimately feels tinny and a bit cheap. The OP and ED are very good, particularly the OP, which fits the series perfectly and is an inviting start to every episode.\nHaibane Renmei (lit. Ash feather federation), starts off in 'Old Home,' a small, peaceful village full of enthusiastic youths. The story focuses on a group of five female 'Haibane,' whom are young girls with tiny wings on their back, and halos floating above their heads. The five eventually become six as a new girl, Rakka, is 'born' into their world. From there, Haibane Renmei follows the trials and tribulations of these girls until its stunning climax in episode 13. With little tangible plot to grip onto beyond the premise, Haibane Renmei essentially revolves around the characters&rsquo; journeys in confronting their own personal issues, set against the mysterious backdrop of Old Home and the encompassing town. People often have gripes about plot points and settings not being literally explained or explored, but in the case of Haibane Renmei the fact that the surroundings of the Haibane and their circumstances are a nostalgic haze lends focus to their internal struggles. This series makes no mistake about what lays at the core of its tale and, as such, every heart-warming gesture or pang of despair is captured with potency and poignancy.\nThe characters themselves are benefited from this focus, with the two main characters given a remarkable amount of depth and intensity for a series of this length. The supporting cast are lent a certain weight, but are not completely fleshed out, which is befitting of their supporting roles, really. One great asset the series has is that, perhaps because it appears to be completely unconcerned with pandering to an audience or a market, its characterization feels uniquely sincere. They&rsquo;re not classifiable as prodigies, tsunderes, role models or heroes, but rather feel like real people with a real heart and soul behind them. Not only does it make the cast likable, but, particularly in the case of the leads Rakka and Reki, this earnestness draws you into their emotional dilemmas and makes you empathize and identify with them. As the characters struggle to come to terms with themselves and their mistakes, it&rsquo;s hard not to be stirred and affected.\nBut much more than just a drama with believable characters, Haibane Renmei is hued in a melancholic and languid atmosphere, and dripping with beauty in its symbolism and mystery. Inviting, warm, and ultimately gripping, Haibane Renmei is a series that is nurtured on emotion and thematic overtones, rather than being constructed with plot and action. If you can appreciate that, then it is sure to captivate. Where Haibane Renmei truly succeeds and other dramatic anime fall to the wayside is in its sincerity. Rather than being conceived for audience appeal, one can feel the passion and emotion of the creator seep through. In short, on top of its charm and poignancy, it feels genuine.\n\nThis review is the final result of a review team composed of members from the 'Critics and Connoisseurs' club.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=233,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    An endless fall; a young girl wrapped in white abruptly descends from the skies. A weightless haze lucidly embraces her. A dream too real, a fall too sudden; awakens she, from a strange trance and finds herself confined in a vessel that’s all too familiar in place that’s all too peculiar. A craft in the form of a cocoon holds the enigmatic maiden—a strange rebirth is to take place. The inhabitants of the building in which the cocoon swiftly lies, await in great patience for the arrival of the girl in white.  \nThus begins the hauntingly decorative tale of “Haibane Renmei”\nInstantly, “Haibane Renmei’s” inquisitive\n          \n        nature provokes the viewer while simultaneously mesmerizing with an unsettling, yet evocative atmosphere. Aesthetically, Renmei is subtly similar to that of an aged watercolor painting with broad strokes and distinct backgrounds. Musically, the series charms with its mellifluous pieces that refine its forlorn and bittersweet atmosphere with poignancy and care. Thematically, it probes the audience to ruminate indefinitely. Combining all those elements and packaging them in an amicable manner, “Haibane Renmei” manages to weave together a captivating tale with unforgettable characters that will surely capture the hearts of those who give it an honest try.\nThe story is simple. The series traces the “new” life of Rakka in the quaint town of Glie that is enclosed off from the rest of the world by an impenetrable wall. The bucolic town is home to both humans and haibane—“beings” with halos and char-coal grey wings. Distinctive of something akin to angels, the haibane subtly but distinctly set themselves apart from their physical image and beatific attributes. Rakka with no former memory or traces of her past assumes her new role and life along with her new haibane family.\nAlthough the story seems straightforward, it is equally deceptive because where Renmei lacks in a strict plot, it makes up for infinitely through its substantial style and themes. With that being said, it is important to note that this is a series that capitalizes on maturing with time, making it a slow ride thereby allowing the viewer to appreciate both the artistic and thematic merits that constitute the show. There aren’t any cheap thrills, gratuitous expositions, female and/or male exhibitionists servicing the fans, or flashy fights; rather it’s a simple tale to bring the viewer a thought-provoking and beguiling experience.\nAs aforementioned, the story is one that may seem simplistic, but under its “no-frills” veil, it’s a labyrinth coated with insightful and empathetic themes. The series is structured in a way that certain, obvious questions are raised. However, while the series provides perceptive themes, it does not supply many answers. Like a distant illusion, a hopeful mirage, the prospect of a potential resolution looms, but never fully manifests.  While that can potentially turn away many viewers, this plays to the show’s strengths because it allows room for imagination and speculation while holding true to the essences of the series. Often times there are no answers and in a narrative based around some themes such as self discovery and self truths, churning out linear answers would be clearly unjustified and of poor taste. \n\"Haibane Renmei\" is a tale that inquires, but doesn’t resolve; it’s not to patronize the viewer, but to enhance the experience by showing rather than telling: a technique that’s highly underrated because it’s often misused or overly-done to a point where it can seem conceited or forced. Through Rakka and her fellow haibane comrades, we get to embark on a very special journey; a journey about a once crest-fallen girl who awakens in foreign lands only to discover the greatest truth—one about herself. \"Haibane Renmei\" illustrates the importance self-discovery, friendship, forgiveness, guilt, salvation, and “truth” in a world shrouded in ambiguity. The haibane almost seem like a nostalgic metaphor, one that eerily resonates with the viewer. Frequently, the closest familiarity lies within the most strangest of places/individuals and through these bizarre encounters do we get the chance to really look into who we are and more importantly, understand who we are.\nOne of the strongest points of the show is the characters. The developing propinquity between the characters is depicted in a classy manner while also establishing memorable personalities amongst the cast. Most of the themes of the show are actualized within the interactions and through the wonderfully constructed dynamics between the close-knit haibane family, the true importance of relationships shine through with blinding effect. The notion of friendship is crafted with extreme care; it isn’t overdone nor is it overbearing to a point where it becomes a contrived plot-device. Rather, it’s there for a definitive purpose: to engage the themes of the show and direct the characters unto their respective paths while providing the viewer with a filling sense of empathy and endearment. The two main characters Rakka and Reki are idyllic in that sense because their dynamics as friends and individuals are done with principle and relevance rather than characteristics defined by formulaic absurdities that accompany “power of friendship”. Both girls struggle and continue doing so but how they cope with their struggle and try to manifest their true selves through their respective struggles is one of the greatest accomplishments of this series and rightfully so.  \nThe art and music both compliment the series nicely. The characters are designed in a humble manner which can be off-putting to certain viewers, but in all reality, the character design fit well for the purposes of the show. The art is fluid. A soft, pastel palette is used to give life to the rustic town while contrasting with darker tones of blues and grays to maintain the melancholy that lingers throughout the series. There seems to be a misnomer regarding this show’s art coming off as ostentatious and obtuse which could be considered distasteful due to personal preferences but as a whole, the art is alluring, complimentary, and aesthetically appeasing. \nThe soundtrack is heavily composed of harmonious yet melancholic piano music accompanied by the lilting of a jubilant violin. Although, the soundtrack is sublime at parts, it isn’t a collective masterpiece or something that would compel the viewer to indulge in as a detached element of the show. Conclusively, artistically and musically Haibane Renmei does not disappoint and serves its intended function to augment the atmosphere and setting of the show.\nPerhaps it should be noted that this series comes from the unconventional yet brilliant mind of Y.Abe who created works such as Texhnolyze and Lain. Whether that is appealing or detracting, it must be understood that Haibane diverges from the extremely dark and brooding presentation of the aforementioned but maintains the thematic and aesthetic segments exceptionally well, just as the other works by Abe. Consequently, if you’re fan or new to Abe’s works and yearn for something that’s delectably intriguing but its own, Haibane Renmei will fulfill every intended quota.\nHaibane Renmei is truly an enchanting series that appeals to the viewer not just as a series to enjoy imminently, but one that forces introspective contemplation afterwards. Truths and answers about the world and self aren’t black and white, but similar to the haibane’s wings--tinted in shades of grey. Immerse yourself in the town of Glie and walk aside the haibane in a world that’s as strange as to you as it is to them; perhaps in the process, you’ll find your shade."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=221,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    This is truly a stand-alone work in terms of originality. ABe did not self-censor and allowed the full weight of his intuition and dreams to direct his hand, and the result is a beautiful, ethereal, archetypal world fully-realized and yet deep enough to retain mystery. The show does not explain everything, even the most important aspects of Gile, and that feels okay. We can see in this fantastic world what is in our innermost hearts, and our intuition fills in so many of the gaps. Few stories manage to do this so well.\nThe story manages to blend soft, yet interesting, aspects of slice-of-life with haunting\n          \n        and bittersweet themes such as suicide, sacrifice, and redemption. This hints of something intimate from within ABe's innermost heart, something he himself has experienced--and in that rawness, there is a universal quality. Many people in fandom have experienced profound loneliness and depression in a manner that seems to echo throughout the story. Many of us have felt useless, hopelessly misunderstood, and lonely. This is a story of comfort.\nTrue to ABe's style, the artwork for this title is utterly fantastic. The setting is stunning in its beauty, European-style architecture amid emerald-green fields and rust-mottled windmills, harmonized with East Asian-style shrines, festivals, and esoteric memorabilia. The characters' names come from Japanese words for concepts, and the world's writing is in Japanese, so it is by no means divorced from its source country, nor does ABe try. The result is not in the least jarring: if anything, it is merely another aspect of integration, something soft and beautiful and lush. And the clouds--the weather phenomena simply looks fantastic.\nIf you cannot stand anime with a slow, idyllic pace, or you simply must have action, giant robots, and political intrigue, this is not the show for you. Likewise, if you cannot stand symbolic, dreamlike storylines in which not everything is explained explicitly, this will drive you mad. Otherwise, I highly recommend taking a trip into Gile. It will be greatly worth your time.\n        "},

Many images fill the screen as this poor girl is falling. From the start, this brings up many questions and possible reasons of what is going on  for the viewer. It's a wonderful start for a deep and involving story, complete with its own take on a Monotheistic society and beings who don't know why they exist or why they are there. Unfortunately, this show sells itself short halfway through the series by turning the main character into a cliche' self-pitying character that finds resole too far into the show to make it matter to the series. Which doesn't make any sense at all considering the creator of this show has made such a detailed civilization with its own take on religion, numerous allusions, and so many better ways to take this show to a more involving story. But in the end so many things are left unanswered and we just end up watching a remake of a show that you've seen many times before.\nAnother part of wanting to know more of this show is all the symbolism and allusions involved in all the artwork to support the back story. Things like dreams, memories, and everyday things bring out the beauty of the Haibane universe. Some things are also left unanswered as to why things look the way they do. Art quality isn't amazing on a detailed sense, but it IS amazing from an artistic standpoint. One theme referenced over and over again in every episode, old. Things like the 'Old Home' or an archaic clothing store all keep their clutter and sense of all things old. Even though they do reference 'old' a lot, the only things that are new in this world seem to be the new Haibane. The artwork also manage to make quite a few memories throughout the show. One of the most memorable scenes i have seen in any anime is definitely the first scene of the first episode.\nThe sound effects and music are something left to be desired but are good at best. The music didn't evoke much emotion with the exception of the OP theme. From a sound effects standpoint, everything sounds standard with the exception of emphasizing silence (you will understand soon). Kids get rowdy, old things creak, shells crack... these things are expected and therefore get a standard grade of good. \nCharacters are all good and fit their stereotype very well. They're all very cute but in a unique way. If you look hard enough Rakka looks exactly like Lain for obvious reasons (same creator). And in the same vein as Lain, this show has a large female cast. The artwork really brings out the characters in their own unique way. You'll be hard pressed not to feel sorry for all the characters in their tragic situation. That, in turn, makes information about the universe that much more desirable. \nLike Lain and Texhnolyze, its artwork, character design, and universe will entice you to wanting more, but will just end up being disappointed again with such poor story telling. I can only recommend this show to hardcore angel lovers and Abe fans. \n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=95,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Some time ago, probably around 2003, I heard about this show called Serial Experiments Lain. Now, at this time, I was only vaguely into anime, and starting my first year at university. Eventually I got it, and watched it, and was amazed that an animated feature could impact me so much. These days, SEL isn't so much a favourite of mine anymore, but the legacy of its creator, Yoshitoshi ABe, passed on to another feature that we call Haibane Renmei; a show that definitely is a favourite of mine to this day.\nStory - 8/10\nHaibane Renmei (lit. Ash feather federation), starts off in 'Old Home,' a\n          \n        small, peaceful village full of enthusiastic youths. The story focuses on a group of five 'Haibane,' which are girls with tiny wings on their back, and halos floating above them. The five eventually become six as a new girl, Rakka, is 'born' into their world. From there, Haibane Renmei follows the trials and tribulations of these girls until its stunning climax in episode 13.\nArt 10/10\nI can't really say enough about Yoshitoshi ABe's watercolour style. Haibane Renmei was adapted from an original doujinshi, almost unheard of for something of this caliber. His artistic style really transfers well to television; animation studio Radix does a superb job making Rakka and Co. come to life.\nSound 10/10\nHaibane Renmei's music is initially highlighted by the appealing opening song and ending songs, but is really made by the stuff in-between. Koh Ohtani (Shakugan no Shana, Shadow of the Collossus) brings his A-game as per usual, really reflecting what it's like to be a Haibane. Also, the sound production itself remains solid to compliment Ohtani's musical score.\nCharacter 8/10\nRakka comes across as a generally lovable lead, followed closely by her faithful supervisor Reki. Most of the girls get varying amounts of screentime beyond that. The only negative here is that not every character is developed enough, but minor and overlooked quite often because of the main two girls.\nEnjoyment 9/10\nHaibane Renmei definitely starts off slow, but it's a good slow! The characters will marvel you, the majestic scenery will move you, the dark undertones will haunt you, and the ending will spellbind you. If you're an anime enthusiast who isn't completely shallow, you owe it to yourself to at least check this title out.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=92,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    After watching this for a third time in the last eight years, I can still say that this is my favorite anime. The themes are very real to me and if you let yourself be immersed by the characters, culture, and plot, you will walk away with a heavy heart and a full mind. \nLike most ABe anime, this is not for everyone. \nIf you are looking for constant action or laughs, I would chose something else. \nThe first five episodes are quite slow, but it lets you take in the details. It helps you focus on the characters and realize they were all part\n          \n        of different walks in their previous life. It more importantly sets up the culture and setting, helping you to form your own theories about who the haibane are meant to be. \nThe sixth episode is where the darker underlying theme start. This series tackles ideas of loss, attachment, depression and suicide. I admit for anyone who has not felt the sense of pure helplessness or bundling emotions until they burst can not fully understand the weight of the internal conflicts both Rakka and Reki face. \nI personally view this series with a spiritual mind rather than a religious one. Though haibane resemble angels, they are born again due to some past sin that they committed or couldn't overcome. Their wings are useless, they do not have a connection to a higher being, and they are almost seen as mystical creatures by the residing humans, often described as a cheerful presence that can give good luck. The haibane are instructed not to use anything that wasn't first used by a human, leading me to believe it is a hint for both discrimination and to cut off ties of the material nature of man. Their whole existence is to make peace within themselves so they can escape the walls on their Day of Flight. \nThis anime teaches you that salvation can not come from yourself. You need to trust others and express your emotions or you will find yourself in the endless, vicious, self-loathing cycle.\n\"To recognize one's sin is to have no sin. So are you a sinner?\"\n\"But if I believe have no sin I become a sinner.\"\n\"This is the cycle of sin. Think about it. To spin in the same circle, looking for where the sin lies, and at some point losing sight of the way out. To find the answer is to find redemption.\"\nIf you are someone who has trouble breaking the sinner's paradox, you will forever be sin bound. You need to realize your sin and know that you will sin again, but to learn from your mistakes and help others forgive you. In turn, they will aide you to break the cycle. \nBoth Rakka and Reki exemplify consuming sin, which is shown by their wings turning a spotty black. Rakka had help from a crow (who was someone she knew in her previous life), which showed that although someone cared for her, after she presumably committed suicide, they still forgave her and wanted to send a message that she was not alone. After overcoming the feelings of wanting to disappear, Rakka uses her strength to help Reki, who was even more hopeless in finding salvation. \nThe ending is bittersweet, but truly outstanding. This series is haunting yet charming, unique and touching. The musical score is enchanting and although the art may not always be the best, it makes up for it in every other aspect. For someone who constantly struggles with depression, it gives you hope and a reason to trust others, even when you don't believe in yourself. \n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=50,   ["text"]="                          \n    (This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\n[Synopsis]: After dreaming of falling through the sky, Rakka (Hirohashi, Ryou) awakens inside a large cocoon from which she is soon birthed. Once emerged, she meets several winged beings adorned with halos called Haibane who welcome her to their abode: Old Home. Rakka’s own wings grow soon after and she joins the Haibane in their daily routines and lifestyle however she wonders about the nature of the Haibane and at the distant wall that blocks off and surrounds their town of Glie from which none of them are allowed to venture near or beyond.\n[Characters]:\nHaibane Renmei has a\n          \n        fairly small cast of characters, mostly consisting of the resident Haibane of Old Home and the townspeople of Glie and of them Rakka and Reki are by far the most important within the narrative with the exception of perhaps the mysterious ‘Communicator’.\nThe majority of the Haibane are friendly to Rakka and each have their own personalities and vocations however beyond that they are mostly flat characters and are given an appropriate amount of attention in accordance with this. The townspeople are similarly underdeveloped simply because they don’t serve any great purpose and none are particularly memorable except for perhaps the store clerk from which the Haibane buy their clothes.\nRakka, the newborn Haibane and the protagonist of the show, is cheerful and friendly and quickly warms up to her fellow Haibane and much of the story is centered upon her drama and her adjustment to her new lifestyle. While she is happy living with her friends and the people of Glie, she is also inquisitive and in this way often ends up voicing many of the viewer’s questions pertaining to the wall that surrounds the town and the enigmatic Toga people. Because of this and her ignorance of the world she serves well as both a means to introduce the world and as an investigative force.\nReki, Rakka’s closest friend and fellow Haibane, is older than her by a few years and has lived in Old Home for some time – she is familiar with the routine of everything and watches after the young Haibane called the ‘Young Feathers’. While her vocation as a Haibane is to look after the children, she shows a similar kind of affection towards Rakka and cares for her when she falls ill. As she is the second oldest Haibane living in Old Home, she is reliable and helpful however she has her own share of demons and her past makes up the rest of the show that doesn’t immediately concern Rakka herself.\n[Art/Animation]:\nThe art does a good job of visually executing Haibane Renmei’s beautiful town and countryside setting and matches its aesthetics well with each other to form a consistent portrayal of the world and characters. The character designs are simple but different enough from each other that they are each distinct in their subdued approach; they fit well within the environment of the show and even with such fantastical traits as wings and halos they feel at home. The animation was no great triumph though it did not feel like it needed to be and worked well at the technical level it was implemented at with the occasional scene sporting higher frame-rates that looked good. I would not list the art and the character designs as an actively positive influence on my perception of the show however they worked well for what they needed to do and I have no negative comments concerning the art or animation which were consistent. Some scenes had particularly good execution such as the growth of Rakka’s wings.\n[Story]:\nHaibane Renmei’s story starts off as a bit of a slow burn as it takes time to introduce the viewer to each of the Haibane and the few townsfolk of note while also situating Rakka within the context of her newfound identity. There is nothing exceptional about this approach however I think it is important that this route was used in that it allows the viewer to slowly establish their own opinion of what the Haibane are and what the implications of the world are as they are unveiled. This kind of thinking is I think the greatest fruit that Haibane Renmei can bear – the show, by way of its fantastic and mysterious premise and setting, raises a great many questions concerning both the characters and the world they live in however chooses to avoid answering most of them.\nOne’s enjoyment of the show will most likely hinge on whether or not they believe that the show worked well in it’s open-endedness or if it should have instead outright explained itself. Those of the latter persuasion may find that the show felt under-investigated however it is from this same vagueness and mystery where the benefit of interpretation comes into play – by leaving many of its questions and circumstances shrouded in mystery it forces the viewer, at some level, to fabricate their own implications and meanings behind certain exchanges and happenings within the world and between the characters. This will be the greatest differing perspective between each viewer and so those who enjoy critically thinking about the significance of things within their shows will probably be attracted to the narrative style of Hanbane Renmei.\nThe story itself is good enough however most of the characters were uninteresting beyond their basic traits and the events that transpire are infrequent and rarely of great consequence. I feel the real triumph of the show is in its extraordinarily compelling world. The narrative concerns itself most primarily with the dramas of Rakka and Reki however in its exploration of those characters crafts an incredible world around them which I ultimately found more interesting and enjoyable than any of the characters. The nature of the Haibane is fascinating as well as the walls that surround Glie and the seldom mentioned Toga who can venture out beyond the wall but do not communicate what they know with the town’s inhabitants or the Haibane. What lies beyond the wall, what the Haibane are, and why everything is the way it is are all questions both Rakka and the viewer dearly want answered as their mysterious presentation is incredibly appealing and, in my opinion, the strongest part of the Haibane Renmei.\nThe story avoids the eeriness of Abe Yoshitoshi’s other famously adapted work: Serial Experiments Lain however features its fair share of darkness within the slice of life framework of the Haibane lifestyle. Additionally, without the directing influence of Nakamura Ryuutarou, the exploration of the characters and the pacing of the story are fare more straightforward in comparison to Lain even while being shrouded in mystery. I think that Haibane Renmei is probably the more digestible of Abe’s adapted works.\n[Music]:\nAlongside the world setting, I would say that the music of Haibane Renmei is the second strongest element of the show. While hardly any of the scenes lend themselves explicitly to a music-centric presentation and most of the soundtrack is comprised of ‘background music,’ I think the music is a powerful element within the show. I found it was somewhat reminiscent of Otani Kou’s later work in Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita however with a bit more of a flare for the dramatic and the melancholy. While the music rarely takes center-stage within the show, its success in establishing the tone in the initial parts of the show as well as its felicitous presence in juxtaposition to the characters and the world is hard to ignore and is an exemplary implantation of advantageous background music.\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \nI liked the show to the degree that I did almost entirely because of the world and the way in which it was skillfully presented and so by nature of the show opting not to answer some of the key questions in regards to those things, I felt the show fell short for me despite the elements that I enjoyed. I don’t think that this was a failure on the part of the creators of the show but rather that I am the potential byproduct of the approach they decided to use when addressing the show. It is a dangerous notion to leave a good deal of information up in the air and unspoken for because, for those that become sufficiently attached to those things, the show then fails to capitalize on what they found appealing and becomes ultimately less enjoyable without ever doing anything explicitly wrong.\nRating: 6\nI gave Haibane Renmei a 6 because, while I found some aspects of the show incredibly interesting and compelling, the other areas of the show weren’t able to compensate for the lack of explanation that the end of the show was begging for. The story of Rakka and Reki is good and I don’t think that it falls short by itself however, after being presented with so many alluring concepts and ideas, to see those fizzle out while their story fails to absolutely blow me away is where the show takes the hits necessary to bring it down to a 6 for me. It was enjoyable and certainly worth the watch however I can’t quite bring myself to call it ‘good’ as the parts of the show that had the potential to be especially satisfying in their clarification were non-present and left to interpretation.\n[Recommendations]:\nI would recommend Haibane Renmei  to anyone interesting in shows with good world building – the setting is not overly complicated or even that fantastical however the way it presents itself in minimalist quality very quickly poses interesting questions that advance the level of world building past what it might normally exhibit. The initial parts of the show are done in a slice of life style and the latter parts exhibit good drama and interesting events and so I would recommend the show for both of those reasons to those interested in those story elements.\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=32,   ["text"]="                          \n    Story:\nNothing really takes place. I know there's a lot of symbolism and world construction throughout the first few episodes, but these cannot be the primary fuel for the journey. The first few episodes are spent with Rakka trying to find a job, which is supposed to be like a light, existential journey of searching where one belongs, but it's not very strong and clouded by this awkward slice-of-life type of pacing that makes it feel long, boring, and drawn out.\nThat's not all. The characters are of some interest, but the Haibane are born into the world with little-to-no knowledge of their previous lives. Of course,\n          \n        this is of interest, but it's not something that is expanded upon or mentioned prominently to be of any real interest. This isn't the error, however. That's merely the cause. The effect is that we get a cast of characters that don't have any real purpose for what they're doing. For instance, a child as it grows merely goes around and does things because why not, but an adult has lived through events that start giving definition to their personality, their choices, etc. None of the characters have this, save for Reki and Nemu. Even then, the majority of their history is only revealed in the latter half of the latter half which makes for a rushed arc.\nMy problem here isn't the overabundance of symbolism in disguise or slow pacing, but the mere fact that there's little reason to watch up until episode 10. It's a whole lot of nothing, which is unfortunate as the world itself is actually quite interesting. I found myself wanting more to the show not because it was good, but because I needed more of a story.\nTo reiterate, I do not want the symbolism explained or even reasons for the laws and culture within Haibane Renmei. What I want (and should be wanted by everyone) is some sort of over-arching conflict or goal that is visible from the beginning. In some ways there is one, but it grows thing incredibly fast.\nAnd please, don't get me started on that shoehorned philosophy midway into the story. There's just a lot of problems on a structural level here, and there really shouldn't be with such a star-studded cast working behind it.\n\nArt:\nThe animation was kinda mehh. I mean, it's a dialogue driven anime, but there were some points where I felt things could have looked better. Perhaps it was the color pallet that was chosen. Either way, it's alright.\nSettings don't feel all that alive. There's a lot of potential here to create a living, breathing world, but these were most likely skimped out on for financial purposes.\n\nSound:\nThere's 2 decent songs, one I really liked, and the rest were forgettable and unlikable. The intro track was great, though. Actually, so was the outro. \nEDIT EDIT EDIT /// I concede to the fact that I was wrong here. After discussing with another individual who has seen the work, I feel as though I've put far too much weight on the music. The purpose of music in a visual work is to assist in translating the emotional value of the scenes and story. The music itself is good. There were 2 songs I felt were pretty fantastic and there was one that I absolutely hated (and was repeated). Perhaps my gripe was due to the fact that there was a huge disconnect between the music and the events taking place. However, I appreciate the comment I received on this, and a special thank you to Buo for coming messaging me. I'm always open to criticism, especially based upon my own criticism. =3 /// END EDIT END EDIT END EDIT\nSince the anime is all dialogue it should be expected that the VA work is fairly good. Thankfully, it was all pretty excellent and I never felt like their interpretations of the script were sub-par. \n\nCharacter:\nI'd like to make note of it again. Due to the fact that we're limited to the Haibane in this story, and taking into consideration their limited knowledge, it's unfortunate that the story kind of limited itself in this way. There's a lot of potential when it comes to this sort of lore, but the failure wasn't in the characters, but rather in the structuring the story and pacing.\nI didn't have any real care for the characters in the first half of this anime, and nearing the middle an event takes place that, to me, felt poorly prepared. This is all the fault of the stories pacing and NOT the characters, as the characters themselves are alright. However, a well-written character is well-written character despite the pacing, and this story doesn't really have that. I did feel some care during the final 3 episodes, but I was still suffering the fatigue of poorly written earlier episodes. I can't overlook this.\n\nEnjoyment:\nI must admit, this was one of the worst anime I've ever had to watch. I know this will seem like the highest sin to many people, (and considering I'm in the minority competing against a median score of 8+) but I can't ignore these issues. I may be putting much more weight on the problems within Haibane Renmei than some other people, but the fact of the matter is that this work is flawed to an egregious degree. I really wanted to enjoy this work considering I found the world, culture, and settings to be quite interesting, but these flaws really killed it for me.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nA 4/10, in my book, is a rating I reserve for works that are just below the sufficient mark. They've shown that they can properly do some things but fail so much in others that all it would have taken is some more work to fix the kinks. It's also a grade I reserve for works that I feel didn't jell with me personally, but others have gravitated towards. It's an acceptance that I think it's bad, but it's not 3- bad. I don't feel like I should need to explain this, but I've given another work a 4/10 that people have found enjoyable and someone sent me a long and arduous message about how I didn't love my mother. Please don't send me a message about how I don't love my mother. If you do I'll show it to my friends and we'll make fun of you. We always need a good laugh.\nIf you want to discuss points of this work in a civil manner, feel free to send me a PM. While I didn't enjoy this work, I love talking about stories, no matter what kind.\n\n((If you liked this review, friend me for new reviews on other works, both manga and anime!))\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=35,   ["text"]="                          \n    Being on every \"recommended anime\" picture list originating from 4chan or reddit, a lot of people say to watch this anime even though its not for everyone and evidently, not for me. \nStory:\nThe first three episodes were cool and I thought they were the introduction, but it turns out HALF of the series is the introduction. I was super hyped starting this show after hearing about it and having it relate to Serial Experiments Lain (worked on by the same guy but not necessarily in a major way IIRC) but it was a major letdown that the story had a great setting without any movement\n          \n        with the characters.\nArt:\nIt's got that \"early 2000's\" feel. Concept art is similar to SEL in style (just look them both up) This and the music kept me going. \nSound:\nThe music is so good, I've listened to it for weeks after I finished the show. Blue Flow is eerily nostalgic for me and brings warm feelings with the other background music doing the same.\nCharacters:\nCharacters aren't really touched upon other than Reki and Rakka who are the main focus of the show. Often times the characters seem flat and  I couldn't care less what happens to them because I don't know enough about them even if they aren't the main focus of the show.\nEnjoyment:\nThe last two episodes made it worth it, but its not worth dragging through the rest of them, trust me, I have done this. Stop at episode 4 if you don't like it. The show is essentially a framework for your own interpretation; they give you the mold to the show, you have to come up with everything else, like what do the festive nut colors represent other than the two explained? or why does the wall do what it does? or how did the regular people get there? The show never touches upon this because its too focused on its characters, and by characters I mean Reki and Rakka and NO ONE ELSE. \nOverall:\nI'm probably gonna get torn a new one for this review, but its as honest as I could get and sure, its been awhile but I wrote this without looking anything up to refresh myself. Again, this isn't for everyone. I expected a fantasy show and got a slice of life with characters who have wings instead.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=15,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    *Minor Haibane Renmei spoilers* \nThe human imagination is capable of incredible things. It can take us to strange and fascinating places, most often through stories. Humans are storytellers by nature, so we’re always telling them. “How was work today? What the hell were you doing at that Steely Dan concert?” Your answer to either of these questions is a story. \nBut there’s a difference between “I got high and spent money on a nonrefundable ticket” and the story of the moving, thoughtful Haibane Renmei.\nHaibane Renmei opens quite strangely. A girl falls from the sky with an eerily calm expression. She embraces a crow, almost as\n          \n        if the black bird were a friend. Then, we cut to a new scene where an older girl, Reki, stumbles upon a white cocoon occupying half of an entire room. Several angel-like beings called Haibane gather around, marveling at the massive cocoon in excitement. From it, the same girl we saw in the first scene breaks out, lacking memories of her name or life before this moment. She then discovers that her plunge in the beginning was just a dream. Good. This dream—an experience restricted to her—is what determines the name given by her friends: Rakka. \nFrom here on, Rakka must adjust to her new life in a strange town by assisting its citizens with various errands. As Rakka becomes more familiar with her surroundings, she begins to ponder over the mysteries of this foreign land—such as the origins of the Haibane; their relationship with regular humans; and the things that lie beyond the huge walls trapping the town. Some of these questions remain unanswered until the end, but frankly, they are better left that way. Upon re-watching the series, I find myself caring less about finding answers and more about the depth of the story. The show does drop some hints about the world, but it also betrays the instincts of its audience. That open-ended trait—the “up to your own interpretation” characteristic that this anime does not avoid—is one of Haibane Renmei’s biggest strengths because of its minimalistic storytelling and focus on branching subplots.\nFor a show about such unique beings, a lot of what goes on just seems so...normal. The writers don’t aim to “wow” the audience incessantly by demonstrating the Haibane to be magnificent creatures. Instead, these angelic individuals closely resemble normal human beings. They live in their own living areas, and they basically scavenge for items left behind by the humans. Despite all this, they’re not exactly bottom-rung members of society like you would think. Some people consider them to be good luck charms and presumably admire them from afar. \nSince the writers aren’t invested in creating dramatic climaxes, the story unfolds at a very smooth pace. It’s a deceptively slow walk, giving the audience room to digest the world, characters, and situations that unfold. Though the early episodes can feel sluggish at times because of their large amount of dialogue, the show’s rhythm or lack thereof is easy enough to accustom with. What begins as a slice of life with an intriguing setup slowly gathers more and more dramatic weight in preparation for its stunning finale. This finale may feel surprisingly cathartic considering the dark themes of the show. The only other moment with this urgency across Haibane Renmei’s thirteen episodes was the time when Rakka’s wings forcefully grew from her back—a grotesque scene that reminded me of Surinam toad births. \nIf you’ve seen parts of the anime or even just screenshots, it doesn’t appear to be much of a looker, does it? Despite its appealing character designs and quaint backgrounds, Haibane Renmei lacks the aesthetics that are on demand by this generation of anime fans. Personally, I think the show’s vintage look has its own brand of charm. The palette is dismal, making use of decisively neutral colors to deliver its subtle, textured story. The animation occasionally dips, but never to a tedious extent. There are also odd editing moments like in episode twelve when Rakka yells “You’re wrong!” to defend Reki—she yells that line over three quick cuts. In both dub and sub, this part feels a bit over the top for me. It should have been executed in a manner that didn’t come off as haphazard. But other than that, there are only a few noticeable gaffes. Impressive for a show with such a low budget.\nThe soundtrack, composed by Kow Otani of Shadow of Colossus fame, accompanies Haibane Renmei’s atmosphere beautifully. I’m quietly listening to it as I write this review in my apartment, and it’s certainly a captivating experience. One moment I remember off the top of my head is the scene in episode eight in which the store owner offers Rakka new boots to replace her sandals for the upcoming winter season. He tells her that the Haibane should be in high spirits, reminding her that the townspeople view them as good luck charms and not the bottom-dweller stereotype acquainted with them. Right as she hears that, some delicate strings make their entrance and fill the melancholic silence of the room. Instead of rejection and pity, this man views Rakka and the other Haibane as blessed beings from above. It’s a heartwarming moment that’s oddly sad because of the accompanying tune.\nNow, I do want to discuss a certain aspect of the show that in contrast with the soundtrack, happens to be a touch overrated in my opinion. The characters in this show aren’t the most developed. Granted, it certainly wasn’t necessary, but other than Rakka and Reki, the other characters are certainly given very little attention from a creative standpoint. They perform their roles nicely and are likable without a doubt, but it can be tough to remember their names due to how much they fail to stand out. Thankfully, Rakka and Reki are more than enough to carry the show’s weight. The two contrast each other with their worldviews, Rakka being naive and becoming more and more comfortable with her new life, and Reki being more solemn due to her conflictions. Much of the back half of Haibane Renmei involves the clashing of their personalities as Rakka tries to help her friend while Reki attempts to push back. With such attention given to these two characters, it can be unsatisfying to viewers how relatively inconsequential secondary characters may appear to be. Honestly, it’s not a big problem for this show, as I’ve hinted, but it’s worth mentioning as a dose of realism amidst the torrent of praise I’m showering on this series. \nThere are a lot of theories surrounding this anime, which is to be expected with how open-ended it is. After re-watching Haibane Renmei a couple of times, it’s easy to get behind the possibility that these people may have committed suicide in a previous life. Obviously, a lot more people did than just the number of Haibane at Old Home, but perhaps they are only a certain group of people that were possibly connected or acquainted in that previous life. It’s not hard to assume that Rakka could have died by falling from a great height, Kana could have drowned in a river, and Nemu could have taken pills to kill herself in her sleep. This theory really gains its biggest support when we reach episode thirteen—the finale. Rakka tries to reenter Reki’s room after being cast out and sees a sort of mirage. I’m not sure what it would be called in this case. Anyway, she finds Reki re-experiencing her dream, facing a train as it speeds towards her. Watching this scene, it just seems like such an extreme metaphor to use out of nowhere. Other than a bicycle and Reki's scooter, I don’t remember seeing a vehicle within the series, so the use of a train creates such extraordinary tension. Its use sticks out and nearly confirms this theory, that perhaps these dreams are more than metaphors. Things like this are what make the series such an enriching experience. There’s more to it than just a cheap binge for pleasure. The enjoyment viewers receive from watching Haibane Renmei is strengthened exponentially by their ability to pace themselves and take in the story’s depth and wisdom regarding human nature. \nHaibane Renmei is a very personal experience for me thanks in large part to its religious influences. In the age of information, a lot of people are more than skeptical of the concept of religion. But in certain areas of the world, it’s difficult to blot out the influence of religion on everyone’s lives. There are many people whose self-worth relies immensely on their relationship with god, and those who are less fortunate in life can inevitably feel abandoned. \nThe characters appear to be angels, but are titled, “charcoal feathers.” Despite this, there are still plenty of religious connections that can resonate with the audience. Most obviously is episode five which literally includes God himself, though it may not be the same God of Christianity. There’s a plotline regarding a book about the beginning of the world which bears clear similarities to the bible. However, the book is damaged and leaves behind mysteries within the story. At the end of the episode, Nemu shows Rakka her own draft, which includes a rewritten story that fills in the details: \n“God then envisioned creatures that looked like himself. But these creatures were failures because they were too similar to himself. So he colored their wings charcoal, made holes on their halos, named them Haibane, and tucked them away in the back of his head.” \nFollowing that, Nemu’s story involves the Haibane escaping the mind of God to avoid being erased and remaining alive thanks to God’s pity. The implications for this story seem to be that the charcoal feathers likely feel they are mistakes, and their existence is pitiful in a sense. They don’t belong anywhere, but they were just simply allowed to remain. \nI think that’s very telling of the tone of this show. The purpose of these characters being here is unannounced, and a major theme of the story is forgiveness. But it’s forgiveness from something unseen. Reki’s ordeal is vivid as any I’ve seen in anime. It’s reality, in fact. I’ll admit that I was at least an ardent follower of Christianity once. There’s plenty of turmoil that can go with putting too many eggs in that basket, and I had some dark times in my teenage years. My brother had to leave the family for certain reasons, and my stepmother did not particularly like anyone in my family. I felt like I was cast away from everyone else under my roof. By high school, I felt attached to almost nothing. Even my link to God, as it were, was feeble, but it was at least something. Few things are worse than not knowing if you’ve done something wrong, and having no lesson to learn as a result. I gave up hope for a while, but I managed to find a way out of my rut—separating myself from religion entirely. Reki didn’t know how to ask for help or at least help herself, so she meets certain doom by wallowing in shame. Though I was there once, I have been in Rakka’s position too. Perhaps that is even more tragic, as the power seems to be even less in your hands. You have the experience of being another individual, so you’re capable of attempting to break one’s trance. But some people are incapable of stepping out of the path of the train and getting help. Don’t they want help? Don’t they want to get better? Asking these questions won’t help. Deep down, everyone wants to get better. Deep down, everyone wants a helping hand. What you need to ask is: “What’s stopping them from asking for help?” \nThat lesson is something you don’t get in every slice of life series. In fiction, you have the potential to experience the life of another, and even learn from their struggles. To do this in a way that resonates on a personal level is something that I could never ask for in most anime. But Serial Experiments; Lain creators Yasuyuki Ueda and Yoshitoshi Abe did it again. Renmei is yet another masterstroke in anime storytelling. The show is certainly the more accessible, more digestible title of the two. It’s a slice of life of the highest order. Though it may be too internally complex to be considered a pure dosage of that, Haibane Renmei has a lot to offer for those interested in experiencing a gentle series with a strong, underlying drama. The series has had a major impact on me personally, and I’m sure that it will continue to inspire me for years to come. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=40,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Storytelling is a labor of love, regardless of what you aim to accomplish with the story. To tell a story that conveys conventional entertainment (through elements like plot, action, and drama) is tough. To tell a story that conveys meaning (through elements like symbolism, motif, tone, and theme) is tough in a whole different way. And to tell a story that conveys both of those things in a deft, skillful manner is the mental equivalent of giving birth: A long, unspeakably painful process. But at the end, you've created something of value and sent it headfirst into the sunlight of this world. Brief, deceptively simple,\n          \n        original, and thought-provoking, Haibane Renmei is such a story.\nHaibane Renmei begins with a scene of strange beauty. A young girl wearing a white robe falls headfirst through an azure sky. A crow appears near her, gently grabs her robe with its clawed feet, and, with genuine compassion, attempts to stop her from falling. This little bird cannot, of course, break her fall. The girl smiles wistfully at the crow and shakes her head. “You can't,” she says. “But...thank you.”\nThe girl, we later learn, is a Haibane—a humanoid who is birthed live from a huge cocoon. Haibanes possess wings and halos whose purpose is unknown. The Haibanes live in a small town called Glie, which is surrounded on all sides by massive walls. To even go near the walls is strictly forbidden. Haibane have no memories of their past identities, and are given a name based on the dream that they had while sleeping in their cocoons. The aforementioned girl is named “Rakka” (eng. “falling”) by the group of five female Haibanes who help her hatch from her cocoon. These five then help Rakka learn the ropes of day-to-day life in the town. \nAt the halfway point of the episode count, the plot makes a transition to darker, more character-focused drama, and it's at this point that the show really hits its stride. This series possesses a key component for dramatic validity that most others simply do not have: Balance. I sympathize heavily with the common complaint that drama is sometimes “overdone” or “forced,” but I found that in Haibane Renmei, the opposite is true. The show's emotional content is often quiet and understated, and it is all the more powerful because of its subtlety and the suddenness with which it can develop out of seemingly normal situations.\nThe characters (or, at least, the two main characters) are fleshed out remarkably well despite the time constraints of a thirteen episode series. The first, Rakka, is a sort of empty vessel; she's born into the world without much of an identity. However, she is naturally curious, and she takes in everything around her and makes it a part of herself. It would have been all too easy to make her into a braindead, one-note, always-smiling-always-happy type, but in a display of very sensible character writing, she instead grows into someone who is influenced by both the positives and the negatives of what she sees in Glie. She is hopeful to the core, but possesses doubts and insecurities which threaten to overcome that hopefulness as the series progresses. Nothing bounces off of her. She is a living character, responding in the truest of fashions to everything that's thrown her way.\nThe other main character is the perpetually smoking Reki. One of the oldest living Haibane, she is a cynical but caring individual who helps take care of the children and newborn Haibane. Reki hides a troubled past underneath an unmoving exterior of wry humor and grit. An extremely well-written character, she is also a powerful symbol, and one of the main vehicles for conveying meaning within the series. She is Rakka's darker counterpart, and many of the most compelling scenes in the show are a result of Rakka's wide-eyed optimism facing off against Reki's wizened voice of harsh realism.\nThematically, Haibane Renmei makes several comments on human sin and redemption. Where the series shines on this front is, once again, the understated way in which it delivers powerful and mature ideas. There aren't any Evangelion-esque scenes where the characters appear to be having a bad acid trip while a weird voice-over shouts philosophical questions. Instead, in the tradition of literature, ideas are conveyed through symbols and recurring themes. It's surprising just how rich with symbolism Haibane Renmei truly is; from the titular gray wings of the Haibane to the walls which surround the city of Glie, it seems like everything is more than it appears. The amount of thought that went into designing this world must have been staggering. And yet, at the same time, the thematic content of the series is easily accessible. This show doesn't ask that you be an analyst to understand what it's about. It only asks that you pay attention.\nHaibane Renmei's soundtrack is a superb demonstration of how an orchestra can navigate the entire spectrum of human emotion. Sometimes it's boisterous and whimsical. Sometimes it's chilling. Sometimes it's unutterably sad. The music here has enough range to perfectly complement whatever is happening onscreen. An upbeat, string-driven instrumental opening and a quiet, vocally haunting ending are perfect bookends for each episode. \nThere is one area where the series falters. Whatever else it might be, when it comes to visuals, Haibane Renmei is no masterpiece. There are some good elements here: The backgrounds are lovely, and the character designs are a breath of fresh air. In recent years artists within the anime industry seem to enjoy depicting women as overly sexualized blobs of skin with massive soul-searching eyes, so it's nice to see an all-female cast that is rendered as a little more realistic looking. It sounds strange to note that the Haibanes, with the full halo and wing treatment, actually look more like humans than most modern characters, but sadly, it's true. However, while the designs themselves are good, the execution is...a little spotty. Character art is often a bit blocky. Characters tend to have poorly defined lines, especially around the hands/arms. This is particularly noticeable in scenes that show them from a distance. Animation is often a little stiff; granted, there isn't a lot of action, and this hardly detracts from the show overall. I'm not going to go on and on, but suffice to say the art in general just looks a little rough. I debated taking a point off of the overall score due to these flaws in artistic execution, but in the end I asked myself: Would the series really be any better if it had sharper visuals? And the answer, I believe, is a resounding “no.” The strength of the show lies with the story it weaves, and no degree of special effects magic would make it any more compelling than it already is.\nAt times uplifting, at times haunting, and always beautifully understated, Haibane Renmei is a superb example of the “complete package” of fiction: In addition to being an extremely entertaining emotional roller coaster full of memorable characters, it's also a collection of powerful and intelligent ideas that are conveyed elegantly to the viewer. Don't be fooled by its brevity or its seeming simplicity—there's far more to this one than meets the eye.\n        "},

When I listen to the OP Free Bird I feel as if I'm reminded of a passed away relative, almost like there's a hole in my heart.

When describing this series, thought provoking is quite the understatement. Mysterious is a super understatement, and beautiful is also not giving it the credit it deserves. The only way I can describe Haibane Renmei and be satisfied is to call it flawless in every single aspect.\nOf course, no anime is flawless, Haibane Renmei included. But when it comes to expressing its themes, Haibane Renmei is top tier stuff.\n          \n        It's themes are pretty subtle, and you'll need quite the imagination to get the full experience from this show. The metaphors can be taken in differently from other points of view, but it doesn't do it in a mindfuck way, like Cereal Experiments Lain. It does so with simple yet thought provoking riddles, subtle symbolism, and little life lessons. \nHaibane Renmei is mysterious. It starts off asking questions, and ends asking even more. However, it doesn't end off in an unsatisfying way. Instead, I thought that in ended beautifully, in a way that gave closure yet still have you a lot of questions to think about long after you finished watching the show. What do all of these little themes in Haibane Renmei mean?\nPros:\n- Simple, well paced, and serene story, full of mysteries.\n- A lot of implied facts and themes, meaning that different people will have a different viewing experience.\n- Very beautiful yet simple art!\n- Another god like soundtrack, Haibane Renmei is another master of music whose soundtrack always seems to fit the mood.\n- Main characters are incredibly deep and fleshed out, even given the mysterious circumstances surrounding them. \nCons:\n- Very little resolution on mysteries.\n- As a result, the plot can feel fairly lacking.\n- Side characters are fairly impactful, but get very little development.\nStory:\nWith a combination of slice of life antics, as well as beautiful symbolism, mystery, and heart wrenching drama, Haibane Renmei sports a very simple, yet also complex and confusing story. The world of the Haibane is incredibly mysterious, and the characters know as much as the viewer about their own world. This not only makes the characters believable and relatable, but also makes their daily lives more impactful. \nHaibane Renmei first starts out being a normal slice of life. It follows a group of Haibanes, which are normal people but with small wings on their backs and halos on their heads, and their daily struggles. Despite their appearances, they cannot fly and don't have any special powers. Their fantasy appearance causes a lot of normal human beings to mistreat them, and a lot of regulations and limitations are placed upon them.\nThe world that this story takes place in can be taken in as symbolism as well. In order to fully explain it all, I must describe the world of Haibane Renmei. Thus, there will be slight spoilers I guess...\n*SLIGHT SPOILERS*\nThe town that the haibane live in are separated from the outside by a huge wall. The townsfolk, including the haibane, cannot go past the walls, and must stay within the town. Only a mysterious group of people, known as Toga, can go beyond the wall. The Toga's mysterious nature aren't touched upon much, but humans and haibane cannot speak to them, except for a communicator. \nThe haibane are hella mysterious. They don't know why they are born, or why they exist at all. However, what they do know is that the haibane have some sort of past guilt or sin that they carry with them. Weighed down by their sin, they can't use their wings to fly. However, when a haibane is ready to move on from their guilt and is forgiven of sin, they take what is called \"the flight.\" That is when a haibane is ready to leave beyond the walls, and fly off in a blinding light. Where they go or whether or not they will be seen again is also a mystery. However, there are also haibane who are unable to be forgiven of their sin. These haibane are considered \"sin bound\" and are unable to take the flight, and are usually depicted as having black feathers instead of gray.\nThis description may seem kind of confusing, but if you try to look at the symbolism within this world, you can come to a conclusion as to what it all means. For example, the city could represent earth. The outside world is heaven. Thus, earth and heaven are separated by a wall, and there is no normal travel between them. The only ones who can travel between them are the Toga, who can represent god. Humans cannot speak to god, which is why no one can speak to the Toga, except for the communicator, who represents an angel. The Toga, or god, bring in things from the outside world, or heaven, and thus bless the earth with things from heaven. Haibanes, who probably represent normal humans, cannot go to heaven until they are forgiven of sin, which is when they are able to finally fly into heaven. However, sin bound haibane cannot be forgiven, and thus aren't allowed to go to heaven.\nAnd what's even more symbolistic are the dreams of Rakka and Reki. Now here is what I'd call a SUPER SPOILER so please look away, but it's a theory that I need to put it on here...\nReki's dream involves standing in front of a train. Rakka's dream involves falling. These dreams are supposed to represent their past, and their sins. Could these two have... committed suicide?\nThink about it. Suicide is one of the most serious sins in the circle of hell, and it isn't one that's easy to forgive. The greatest sin about suicide is hurting the ones who try to save you, which in Rakka's case, is symbolized by a crow trying to keep her from falling. This is also why Reki was sin bound, as she always pushed away those trying to save her. \n*END SPOILERS*\nThere is a lot more subtle symbolism and mystery, like the symbolic meaning of gray feathers, and the circle of sin riddle. These metaphors only scratch the surface.\nArt: \nVery earthy art style, Haibane Renmei uses a lot of natural colors, like brown, gray, yellow, and green! This makes the show look like a painting instead of an animation. It gives off a very melancholic and peaceful atmosphere, as well as an eerie and mysterious vibe. It truly synergizes with the mysterious story of Haibane Renmei. The character designs are also simple, but very beautiful. Rakka is pretty adorable, and you can somewhat get a sense of a character's thoughts and feelings by their design. \nSound: \nHaibane Renmei sports an incredibly beautiful and fitting soundtrack. The OP in particular is just 10/10 all around, and the OST always fits the mood of a scene. The voice acting is also incredibly on point, as it really expresses the moods and characteristics of each character. The use of sound for story telling was also well executed, such as bell tolls and other sound affects.\nCharacter: \nRakka and Reki are extremely deep and down to earth characters, making them amazing protagonists. Despite their fantasy appearance, they are still relatable and believable, reacting to different scenarios in a realistic way. They know very little about their world as well, and whenever they learn something about their world, it isn't always taken well. The side characters are also very believable and well rounded, and although don't go through much development, are still a very likable and impactful cast of side characters.\nEnjoyment:\nBeautiful, enchanting, peaceful, but also heart breaking! Haibane Renmei was an amazing experience, with a great mix of peaceful slice of life, gripping drama, and thought provoking mystery.\nOverall: \nHaibane Renmei is still underrated in my opinion. While a peaceful and mysterious slice of life with slow pacing is definitely not for everyone, for those that enjoy these types of shows with substance, you'll really love Haibane Renmei.\nTL;DR: In all seriousness, Haibane Renmei easily stands as one of the most emotionally impacting anime that I've ever seen, as it touches such powerful themes in such subtle yet awe inspiring ways. At face value, a plot that brings up so many themes yet doesn't resolve them for you can be a disappointment, but Haibane Renmei does it in the most satisfactory way possible. It's not the events in the show that break your heart, its when you realize what it all means that causes your jaw and heart to sink to the floor. As someone who quite unfortunately relates to the depressing themes that Haibane Renmei delves into, I can honestly say Haibane Renmei has the possibility of being a life changing experience.\n        "},

Not technically amazing, but artistically it's pretty darn good.\nSound - 8: I love the opening and closing songs. The soundtrack is a little bit less impressive, but the series knows how to use silence to good effect.\nCharacter - 8: Two of the characters have surprising depth, the rest don't. Great character designs.\nEnjoyment - 7: It's a very calm and peaceful show that might frustrate you with its slowness,\n          \n        however patience is rewarded.\nOverall: 37/50 = 7.4.\nI tend to rate lower than other reviewers, so my score might be the equivalent of an 8.\n\nI am somewhat sympathetic to the raving reviews of this anime, however I think a big part of it is just that it hit a sweet spot, not that it was as great as it's built up to be. What I mean is that it provides a lot of what is lacking in most anime, and for this it gets built up a little higher then it deserves. Yes, it has discarded the flash and dazzle, and made a calm tranquil ambiance, filled with mystery and intrigue, it tells a story directly from the heart, patiently and filled with wisdom. But as much as it blatantly appeals to a more sophisticated audience, it comes across as somewhat pointless. \nIt tells two stories of human nature, both of losing one’s way and finding it again. The story of Reki was particularly touching, with her perfectly executed self-hatred giving way to a message on how we can never live by ourselves. It doesn't tell anything new, it's an age old theme told time and time again, and already told better by a more famous anime (*cough* evangelion *cough*). \nHowever, in the end the inclusion of religious symbolism is what really hurt this anime for me. Hundreds of reviewers will tell you that this wasn't a religious anime. That's not quite true. It doesn't preach someone's interpretation of someone else's holy words, but the concepts and sentiments it conveys are classically religious. It preaches what is a sin and what isn't, it invokes god (no, they don't literally say “god,” but it's really obvious who represents god), it creates an idealized world as a manifestation of Christian sentiments. This troublesome religious message from the man who brought us Serial Experiments Lain sort of weakened the show for me. \nIt's not particularly clever, but it says what it has to say in a very effective manner. Just for execution alone this anime deserves props. The characters were all believable, the animation and music were terrifically dreamy. In the end, it was a show worth watching, but I prefer Serial Experiments Lain, a less direct and less preachy show by the same creator."},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="                          \n    “Perhaps this is what it means to be bound by sin. To spin in the same circle, looking for where the sin lies, and at some point losing sight of the way out.”\nShow and tell are the biggest principles when it comes to modern entertainment. Unfortunately, most modern anime get wrapped up in the “tell” portion of this relationship, often causing the viewer to know all about the characters and plotline, while the ambiguity and mystery begins to fade away entirely. The result is something empty, predictable and otherwise boring. The other end of the spectrum create anime that are often regarded as intellectual or\n          \n        atmospheric in nature. They are the types of shows that allow the viewers to draw their own conclusions, while keeping the mysterious and unanswered alive and relevant. These are the types of anime that get talked about (for better or for worse) for years to come.\nHaibane Renmei is most certainly a “show” style of anime, essentially dropping you into its lucid and ominous world, with little to no explanation as to what anything is. You discover the setting and atmosphere along with the main protagonist, Rakka and an open-ended interpretive storyline ensues. The “Haibane”, are individuals who randomly spawn from cocoons in a bizarre, walled-in world called Grie, equipped with charcoal feather wings and endowed with halos in order to make them distinguishable from the normal townspeople. There are many rules of this place the Haibane must follow, for reasons unknown… but most of all, they must not go beyond the walls surrounding their dwelling place. All Haibane experienced some sort of dream prior to their arrival, which is a direct connection to their names in the present world.\nMost things in Haibane Renmei are very “matter of fact”. Haibane are not allowed to speak in certain places, they only receive second-hand goods and clothing and they are limited to working specific jobs around the town. Despite all of this, the Haibane lead relatively peaceful lives. They grow to accept their place and most of them lose their questioning attitude. As the story unfolds, Rakka delves deeper into the true roots of her existence in Grie, while doing her best to help out other Haibane. \nI found the first half of the series somewhat dull, although most of the worldbuilding conducted in these episodes was a necessary evil. Nothing really “happens” persay, but character relationships are developed, and the writers do a fantastic job making you feel like a part of the environment you are transported to. I guess you could attribute this type of storytelling to the original creator, Yoshitoshi ABe (Serial Experiments Lain, etc.). Haibane Renmei has one major positive that SEL simply doesn’t have: accessibility. It’s much less convoluted and trippy, while maintaining an equal level of symbolism and atmosphere present in its predecessor.\nAnother interesting thing to point out about Haibane Renmei is there’s really no “antagonist” in the entire anime. Most all of the conflict is internal to the characters themselves, which is very contradictory to most anime released today. As anime viewers it sometimes feels like we’ve grown accustomed to being spoon fed with a plot and “bad guy”, so the inquiries made by Haibane Renmei’s story feel very atypical at first. It’s certainly something you have to get used to after watching modern anime, but this also allows the series to become quite versatile.\nThe thematic nature of Haibane Renmei is another point of dexterity it exudes. Many people believe the Haibane to be individuals who have committed suicide, and are stuck in purgatory, atoning for their sins in order to take their “day of flight” and move on into salvation. It’s just one of the many theories surrounding the series, but I think there’s little doubt that it is a testament to one of Haibane Renmei’s most prominent themes, retribution. While in Grie, the Haibane help conquer their biggest internal strifes, while helping others to the greatest extent of their abilities. At first I was put off by how helpful everyone seemed in the town, but the retribution theme kept popping up in my head and it mostly made sense after that.\nThe ending episode, without giving away any spoilers, is one of the best conclusionary segments of recent memory. It’s quite powerful and puts many points into perspective. It also puts closure on many aspects of the Haibane world, while still leaving plenty of interpretations out there to think about. It’s wonderfully paced, and packs a punch emotionally. One of the few endings that have made me shed a tear.\nAs with many anime of its type, Haibane Renmei is rather open-ended. Even the creator made it a point to mention that there were many parts of the series better left unexplained. This creates two reactions to anime fans. 1) The more logical minded viewers get frustrated and disregard the series in general for being less cohesive, or 2) The more open-minded viewers talk in great length to the mysteries the anime contained and the various themes present within it. I’m normally a logical person, but I appreciated what Haibane Renmei presented to the inquisitive. ABe prided himself on the fact that the manga was written “as it went”, which could be another reason for how the series seems less contrived and more up to the viewer to decide its true nature.\nTo me, there are really only two characters that matter in the entire series: Rakka and Reki. That’s not to say that the other characters were bad, but they didn’t receive the necessary development to be relevant in the grand scheme of things. This is mostly due to the short run time (13 episodes) of the anime itself, one of my biggest complaints. The result was my lack of interest in the other characters, potentially missing a development point for them I would’ve otherwise latched onto. Rakka started off as a relatively boring protagonist in the first part of the series, but grew greatly as she began to discover her true identity and purpose in Grie. Reki, on the other hand was a very complex character from start to finish. You knew from the start she put on a slight facade, and her unraveling was emotional and gripping. \nThe animation in Haibane Renmei is very hit and miss, depending on the scene you’re watching. This is a similar complaint I had with Lain, because most of the time the art seemed low budget or sloppy, but when an important scene arose it appeared that the detailing was exemplary. It’s an inconsistent used of the studio’s money, but in their defense I guess it helps enhance the emotion from the well-animated scenes. The colors used in the various environments are flat and washed out, causing the dreamlike, languid atmosphere to really impact the viewer. The character models were decently drawn, but nothing spectacular.\nMusic, while nothing over-produced or extravagant, was undeniably effective. The OP is reminiscent of the environments crafted by ABe. It’s fanfarish but mysterious, I loved how simple but beautiful it seemed. The ED was alluring yet unsettling, with a single image of Rakka seemingly trapped in her dreamlike state from the cocoon. The rest of the OST was brilliantly placed when the mood fit, and I had to download it immediately afterward. Voice acting was very strong in the English dub for the likes of Rakka and Reki, which was impressive considering the lack of impressive credentials amongst the main cast. I’d rank this as one of the best dubs I can remember with Cowboy Bebop, Monster and Paranoia Agent.\nTo summarize my “negatives” for Haibane Renmei:\n1) Too short, leaving almost no time to develop beyond the two major characters\n2) Animation is very sporadic and can be distracting in some instances\n3) Easy to lose interest in the first few episodes due to worldbuilding and character relationships\n4) Doesn’t follow a specific “plot formula”, making it less appetizing to more logical viewers\n5) People may get too wrapped up in its unanswered questions and focus less on its overall themes\nMy final verdict of the series would be positive. I’d highly recommend this to anyone who’s a fan of anime like Serial Experiments Lain, Texhnolyze or Paranoia Agent, and its similarities to Angel Beats actually made me dislike the latter anime even more because it’s just a worse version of Haibane Renmei. If you aren’t a fan of brain buster shows, you might still get something out of watching for the worldbuilding, but you’re better off steering clear of this one. Sure, many of the questions brought up in the series aren’t answered, but that’s part of what makes Haibane Renmei special. It’s minimalist approach, coupled with superb crafting on ABe’s part make it an anime worthy of praise for what it accomplished with so little actually being done. It does suffer slightly from budgeting problems and overall length, but it most certainly leaves an impression and moment of pondering on you, something I can’t say about many other anime out there. \n        "},

These are often either overly dramatized and unrealistic, meaning it lacks a proper foundation on which to support its ideas coherently. Haibane Renmei does this flawlessly, containing soothing slice of life moments, in addition to expanding on the topic of Existentialism in a subtle manner. Friendship, guilt and depression are other themes that are dealt with, whilst leaving the viewer with an open interpretation of the bittersweet conclusion. Be warned though, this anime doesn't appeal to the majority of viewers,\n          \n        as it can get confusing when not carefully watching it.\nThe story of Haibane Renmei is centered around Rakka, born in a cocoon admits a group of females with wings on their backs and halos above their heads, called \"Haibane\". She experienced a dream of falling, then birth. What does this all have to do with each other? Why is there a tall, impenetrable wall that surrounds the town of Grie? The fact that only the mysterious \"Toga\" are allowed to exit creates more questions to ponder about this world presented to the viewer. \nWhile the story itself is of simple nature, yet where it shines is in its execution and the narrative. Audiences are presented with the mystery surrounding this world and its exterior, which never really gets revealed to the viewer. It is focused on the small world within the walls, where the protagonist suddenly encounters herself in a strange place, with peculiar people while being a stranger herself. Nothing less, and nothing more. Such interactions with the people are soothing, yet realistic. It has a consistent pacing throughout its duration, carefully introducing and displaying little hints on the world, as well as the charcters\nAs mentioned earlier, the story focuses around Existentialism which is magnificently done through the people and the character's behaviour. It is a tale that evolves from heartwarming tales to a stunning development in the second half. Afore mentioned interactions do not only convey a relaxing atmosphere, it carefully introduces the characters problems with life, as well as revealing the mystery surrounding the town. However, viewers never really get this information directly; it is deduced from its surroundings, character's and through the art. Speaking of which, the aesthetics chosen resemble that of an angel, yet this doesn't allure to religion in any way. Other thing to note is the fact that viewers don't know anything more than the character's themselves, which adds to the element of mystery.\nThe cast of characters are small, yet varied. The main focus lay upon the two characters, Rakka and Rekki,  being these well fleshed out and undergoing significant character development throughout its duration. These have remarkable depth and are surprisingly interesting, audiences observing how these interact with their surroundings and society, in addition to providing occasionally some background stories. Hardships such as loneliness, insecurity and the likes they endure are very relatable to audiences, making it easier to engross oneself in the narrative. The supporting cast isn't that well fleshed out, yet are of crucial importance in understanding the characters motives and behaviour. Other remarkable aspect are the mysterious \"Toga\" who add a significant layer of mystery to the show. A thing to note is that the characters are not divided into archetypes, which add credibility to the story.\nThe animation quality of Haibane Renmei is rather lackluster in comparison: character's movement come over rather rigid at times, in addition to the character's design in the background being rather distortioned or simplified. Nonetheless, it fulfilled its purpose; what is remarkable though, is the fact how the wings apparition was portrayed: this was stunningly realistic looking, easily conveying the pain the character was feeling. What however is remarkable is the art style utilized in the anime: it is befitting of the atmosphere, being bleak and grey, in a dream like setting. The character's design are unique in its own way, yet was difficult to distinguish at first the gender of some of its cast. The backgrounds were drawn well and were varied, interesting to look at.\nWhat struck me was the soundtrack used in Haibane Renmei, as opposed to other reviewers: it matched with the setting and the story it was trying to portray, with piano, violins compositions and some simplified lullaby's, being compositions such as Ailises Grises or Blue Flow magnificent compositions. Not to mention the ending and opening that fits with the series. The voice actors performed their roles well, yet there were instances when these didn't correctly portray the behaviour of characters, which slightly hindered the immersion in the story.\nHaibane Renmei was overall a very enjoyable anime with a very alluring fantasy setting shrouded in mystery, as well as the captivating characters and their interactions with their surroundings. The lack of explanation on the outside world and the specific explanation on Haibane was a drawback personally, as it could have expanded a bit more on it, yet was easily overshadowed by its strengths. The climax of the series leaves quite some things open for interpretation, which in this case is actually works in favour of the anime. So do I recommend this anime? Indeed, I do, yet viewers may be warned as it can be confusing at times.\nThank you for reading.\n        "},

While I usually prefer to discuss the medium in a more formal and authoritative voice, I am also interested in the less formal personal experiences writers like to share in their works. Not to take away from the formal and authoritative voice, but it tends to lack warmth and is sometimes unable to properly convey the writer’s ideas, which are usually tied in with their emotions, to a certain degree. Another fan’s personal experience with any given title is\n          \n        a truly interesting box for me to open. Why did a reviewer think such a series was worthy of high remarks? Is it based on their previous experience in the genre or maybe just the opposite? Why was the anime so relatable to the author of the review? Did it touch upon a certain demographic background or particular sensibilities? Answering these questions not only puts us on the path of learning more about the title being discussed, but also the how and why the fandom experiences it in any given manner. In other words, we learn more about both the medium of anime and its fandom in a single stroke. Haibane Renmei has inspired me to take this personal approach to discussing anime as it is a title that reverberates with me on numerous levels. An experience that I would not and could not be able to properly convey in a more formal and authoritative presentation.\nI love when an anime title, or any story for that matter, is filled with melancholy, which sounds like a weird oxymoron. As I have mentioned before, the sentiment of pensive sadness is something which reverberates with me on multiple levels. For myself, melancholy is the sentiment I feel when I learn about how my happiness (or blissful ignorance) or someone else’s cannot last forever. In other words, when reality checks in. Melancholy is the sentiment I feel when I’m fully aware that the joy I’m experiencing can’t last forever and will come to an end one day. On one hand, I’m happy to have learned something new, even if it comes at the price of happiness. On the other, it hurts to know that happiness, or any given positivity can’t last forever. However, I don’t necessarily view melancholy negatively. As I see it, it’s the sentiment which reminds me to not only enjoy the moments of happiness that I’m currently living, but to also appreciate the smaller things in life because like everything, they will not last forever. Haibane Renmei is a series which I believe is very much in tune with this sentiment of melancholy which defined my experience with the series.\nHaibane Renmei is filled to the brim with melancholy from its presentation, to its characters and the story. In fact, a properly presented melancholic story is particularly hard to come by, since the sentiment is so hard to pull off in an on-screen presentation. It requires a perfect cooperation between the audio visual presentation and the plot to brew up the mood of thoughtful sadness, a sentiment which is hardly universal. As for why I think we should recognize the worth of melancholy is a personal opinion on the other hand. Just like any emotion, melancholy is subjective to our own experiences. However, it isn’t all out sadness or depression. Instead, it’s a sentiment of sadness brought about by thought. To me, melancholy is a form of pensive sadness brought on by our awareness of the world around us. It is a feeling that we experience when we understand (or attempt to understand) how our life functions, how people truly are and that the good times never last. All of which are key points that Haibane Renmei play upon to present its story to the viewer. Through the use of its moody atmosphere, creative world and the troubled characters, Haibane Renmei induced an all pervasive sense of melancholy with every passing episode as I learned more about every aspect of the series. In the following paragraphs, I will attempt to colour you a picture of the series and its messages as I experienced them.\nThe world of Haibane Renmei is one of an illusorily beauty which deceptively hides a grander secret. Within the giant walls, which surround the town of Glie, the Haibane Renmei are born. Angel-like with halos and charcoal coloured feathered wings sprouting from their backs no one, not even the Haibane Renmei know from where they originate or how they came to be in the world. Unable to remember their past lives, they are given names based on their very last dream before being born into the world anew. While they are treated with respect by the human villagers of Glie, the Haibane Renmei live separately outside of the town in rundown edifices nicknamed as ‘Old Home’ and ‘Abandoned Factory’. They never earn money from the jobs they work and can only use second hand items and clothing. As a result, the Haibane Renmei live frugal and humble lifestyles until their time of flight arrives, the moment a charcoal feather disappears in a blinding light to finally move beyond the giant walls which surround the town and its surroundings.\nThe series never hints at what lays beyond the walls, and it is one of the many questions which I believe Haibane Renmei intentionally leaves open to reinforce one of the points of the series. In many ways, the cycle of life of the Haibane Renmei mirrors how humans live out their own lives and understand their world. We only grasp at straws when it comes to finding the origins of life or its all-important meaning. All in the while we are surrounded by the wall which is the limitations of knowledge and understanding and never learning what truly lays beyond the concrete structure. While human knowledge constantly expands, the more we learn, the more we know less about. It’s the great irony of knowledge. To truly be knowledgeable is to know that we still have much to learn. As the viewer learns more about the secrets of the world of Haibane Renmei, the answers we do receive only serve as fuel for grander questions. Rakka learning as to how to become free of sin and witnessing the inner workings of the walls only serve as a foundation for larger questions to which neither we nor Rakka ever receive. It’s the somber cycle of knowledge in which we never truly find a definitive answer to some of our most important questions pertaining to our existence. And like the Haibane Renmei, we do not know what happens to us when we finally take the final leap from our lives. In many ways, the life cycle of the charcoal feathers reflect the mysteries and boundaries of our own lives, illustrating life in all its beautiful limitations and disparity. Sounds a tad cynical, doesn’t it?\nHowever, it is the mysterious world of the series and the life cycle of the Haibane Renmei which bring about a bitter sweet tinge of melancholy in my heart when I experienced the series. How are the people of Glie able to experience such full lives knowing that they are forever limited by the walls which surround their town? How are the Haibane Renmei so content with their short lives knowing nothing of their past or future? The series generated these questions amongst others which really installed a state of pensive sadness which had me contemplating several ideas and issues. Seeing how happy the villagers and the charcoal feathers were with what they had, do we really need more in terms of knowledge to truly be content with our lives? Would we truly be happy to finally reach the answers that we have been seeking about our origins and destination, even if it means we do not like what we find? Will it actually change anything? Is there a reason why we don’t already know the answers to these questions? For the record, I believe that searching and asking questions is always the right direction to go, even if it leaves a sour taste in your mouth, but Haibane Renmei does a fantastic job at posing these questions through the development of its mysterious world. My feeling of melancholy sprouts from the fact that these are questions that no matter how much we search, we might never actually find the answers. The universe is infinitely large and while we continue to learn, our knowledge seems to only open up more questions about how and why everything was, is and will be. Yes, we always find new answers, but it’s a little saddening to be running a marathon which seems to have no finish line.\nNot to mention the impact the personal ventures the characters of the series have also have a significant impression on the melancholic feeling I felt when I first watched this series. The Haibane Renmei seem content to live such simple lives despite not knowing their past, their future, or the meaning of their existence. Discouraged from finding the answers that they seek, and forbidden to go anywhere near the walls which surround Glie, they are promised answers once their time of flight arrives. Similar to their human counterparts, they simply choose to accept the status quo and try to live their lives as simply and as happily as possible. Instead of searching for answers, the charcoal feathers put all their energy into being as “good” as possible in order to avoid becoming sinful. As to how the Haibane Renmei become sinful is left as ambiguous as it is in our reality. Obvious statements aside, the charcoal feathers fear becoming sinful as the immoral amongst them are unable to take their final flight beyond the walls, lose their wings and are eventually ostracized from the community.\nWithin the world of the series we also have two characters whose struggles struck a particular chord with me. Both Rakka and Reki, two charcoal feathers, struggle with the fact that they were sin bound. To be sin bound in the world of Haibane Renmei is the worse fate possible for a charcoal feather. For reasons unknown to all, both characters are tainted with black feathers on their wings, which labels them as sinners to both humans and fellow Haibane Renmei alike. The results of the disfiguration of their wings being obvious, both characters fear for their outwards perception to others as well as their ability to one day escape beyond the wall in their time of flight. As a consequence of the particular appearance of their wings, both characters mutilate themselves by cutting and pulling out the black feathers. But like the pain of not knowing as to why they are sin bound and the uncertainty of their future, the black feathers reappear only to make them feel like outcasts once again. And with the return of their black feathers the cycle of pain and sorrow begins anew.\nThe title of being sin bound in the world of Haibane Renmei comes at the toll of the emotional and psychological wellbeing of those affected by sin. For a charcoal feather, being sin bound is the worst possible fate and to absolve themselves of sin, they must first find the origin of their sin, recognize themselves as sinners and finally find forgiveness. However, to ask for forgiveness is to recognize oneself as a sinner therefore perpetuating one’s status as a sinner forever locking themselves in the cycle of sin, absolution and search for forgiveness. To search for forgiveness is to be a sinner. To accept forgiveness is to be a sinner. However, a sinner must always search forgiveness. If it seems to you that to be sin bound is synonymous with being a victim of a system with obviously broken logic, then you are right.\nHaibane Renmei does a splendid job of demonstrating how human ideas, such as sin, can have on an individual and can negatively impact them socially, emotionally and physically. For fear of not being able to take her time of flight, Reki had completely separated herself from the other charcoal feathers by the end of the series both emotionally and physically. The toll of not being able to find a means to rid herself of her sin had taken too much effort and energy out of her for years. Instead, she opted to give up and let her life slip away. Haibane Renmei’s message here is a strong one, and still as relevant as ever. A system of judging the worth of individuals based on morality is not only ineffective, but can be downright cruel towards the outliers of any given community. Both Reki and Rakka, could not fully remember the meaning of their dreams, and therefore did not know as to how and where to search for forgiveness. Instead of helping them, the series both labels them and ousts them as different for the inability to meet this certain set of requirements. Not only is it completely unfair, it also feels like an inescapable hellhole for those afflicted.\nThe series induces a strong sense of melancholy within me since it resonates with an all too apparent reality with which most of us tend to look over. Even though most of us do not judge the make-up of an individual based solely on their morality, the notion still influences and colours our perceptions of others. The usual targets of such perceptions of tinged morality are those on the borders of what I think we can call the ‘acceptable society’. For example, homosexuals, transgendered individuals, criminals, drug addicts, and the poor are all examples of groups that we find on the fringes of society. And while I accept any of these groups with open arms, mainstream perceptions still hold these groups back due to their differences from what is expected in mainstream society. This is in due part to the influence morality still has on our perception of other groups. In many regards, the above mentioned groups are negatively labelled for some form of social deviance that they are the result of or responsible for. It doesn’t explain the entirety of reasons these individuals find themselves on the outside looking in when it comes to society, but demonstrates morality still has a significant impact on how we perceive other groups.\nAnd like in Haibane Renmei, these individuals suffer for who they are at the hands of a broken system of judgement that isn’t built to accept them. Instead, they either force themselves into society by attempting to lie about who they are or remain on the fringes to be continually judged by those whom meet the somewhat nonsensical requirements to be recognised as socially acceptable. Rakka’s and especially Reki’s struggle with not being able to meet the standards of morality while being on the fringes of their respective groups made me think that their difficulties were a rather accurate reflection of how social outsiders think and feel in our own world. What made me rather sad, was that both of them only found solace once they were forgiven and hence permitted to take their time of flight. Or in other words, they conformed to the system of judgement in the world of Haibane Renmei instead of it changing for them. It’s sad to say, but on that note, Haibane Renmei is also accurate.\nHaibane Renmei fills me with pensive sadness because of how accurately it reflects certain points in our own reality. On one hand, the mysterious world of the series provides the viewer with a fantastic allusion to the difficulties relating the grander mysteries of life. Can we ever truly know what happens after we die? Will knowing the answers actually change anything in our lives? Or are we forever bound by the restrictions of our abilities to ever be able to find the answers we seek? On one hand I’m glad to keep asking questions about the grand universe in which we live, but as the series acknowledges, I’m aware that neither you, I or humanity will ever truly find a definitive answer to the problem. It’s the thought that leaves me with a sentiment of melancholy, I’m glad to know that we are always learning, but it saddens me to know that we are forever limited in what we are able to grasp and understand. On the other hand, Haibane Renmei sends out a strong message about how morality affects those whom we judge to be on the fringes of society. The series accurately reflects how those who are not acceptable by mainstream social standards are often demeaned through a moral perspective and labelled with some form of social deviance. It not only justifies their societal positions in the eyes of mainstream social standards, but demonstrates how morality still has an impact on how we both label and judge others. As it was the case with both Rakka and Reki who were judged by standards that they could not meet by a system which does not recognize the worth or differences of those whom not always meet a certain set of societal requirements. Both these aspects filled me with melancholy because thinking about them was great in the sense that the series made me ponder about issues I don’t usually pay much attention to in the first place. However, such thinking led me to saddening conclusions about both ideas discussed above. On one hand I’m happy to have critically thought and learned due to this series, but on the other the realizations I made both on my own and those presented by Haibane Renmei, left me saddened by the end. I always found the sentiment of melancholy to be sad, but in some odd sense beautiful for what it brings to me at the same time.\nThere is also a lot more to say about the characters themselves and their struggles as well as the remaining symbolism present in the show, and while this review would most certainly benefit from going more in depth regarding those elements (which are also wonderfully handled in Haibane Renmei), I personally think that they, along with the story being told, ultimately serve the purpose of allowing the true strength of the work to surface and it is this very same strength that pushed me to write this review in a less formal and authoritative presentation I wouldn't have otherwise bothered writing in. And any work that has the ability to do that while also providing strong entertainement with powerful drama involving relatable characters is worthy of every little bit of praise it has been getting.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    Haibane Renmei provides an account of the mystery of the \"Haibane\" that are born from eggs at various ages into colonies of other Haibane at an unknown, sealed location. The Haibane are born with virtually no memories except for their dream that is often remembered from the \"incubation\" period. The series follows one particular individual who is named Rakka at birth as she attempts to uncover her past life of which she vaguely recalls. The series explores the mystery of the lives of the Haibane as well as the association which governs their lives. It details the attempts to discover one's as well as one's\n          \n        to cope with loss and reconcile with one's mistakes while accepting their consequences. The series teaches the viewer how to honestly accept one's failures and misdeeds and to seek help outside of the self. It is both a story of redemption as well as self-discovery. \nThe beauty of the series lies in its presentation. Granted, this is also the main flaw in the series. Information about the world is very slowly developed through demonstration as the characters have limited knowledge about their world just as does the viewer. In this sense, the series evokes a realistic presentation, which is simultaneously unsettling due to the nature of the circumstances. The viewer finds it difficult to trust any of the information or characters being presented in a similar manner to how every individual must choose to trust the information being presented. The tone of the series provides a sense of something sinister being masked with a gentle smile that is slowly creeping up on you. And it does this through the use of innocent beauty. Beauty that is mysterious, foreign, and seemingly tranquil. The show accomplishes an eerie feel, but only does so through its slow pacing and failure to provide any third-person information to the viewer. This accomplishes something remarkable from a story-telling standpoint, but it also risks boring and off-putting many traditional viewers. In this sense, Haibane Renmei's strength is also its greatest flaw. It demands attention, care, and pateince from the viewer in order for the 13 episode experience to be truly profound and personal. \nThe actual Haibane Renmei organization which supports the Haibane's way of life operates almost entirely from the shadows only rarely providing a spokesperson from which the viewer can obtain information about the world and the fate of the characters. This is the aspect of the plot which requires the most careful scrutiny because not only is scarce information provided, but it is also somewhat cryptic. In fact, there is no possible definitive conclusion about the circumstances of the organization and the Haibane (the writer stated that the series has no incorrect interpretation) although it becomes quite apparent what is really going on if you really think about all the details it for a while (pm me if you want to talk theories). \nIn a more general sense, Haibane Renmei is a story about death and beauty, love and forgiveness, and ultimately redemption and salvation. The most grave of topics, boiled and condensed into a presentation with tranquil scenes of children playing in nature with classical music in accompaniment as a troubled Rakka has her heart set at ease, smiling upon them. It teaches us that no amount of worry or grief will enable us to overcome our obstacles and that true beauty lies in surrender and immersion into the unknowable, that we can only truly find ourselves when we look outside to others, and that finding peace with the universe is an individual journey which cannot be imparted to another.\nI may have a person tendency towards philosophy, and this series certainly contains much to contemplate, but the more average viewer will find an emotional journey met with tragedy and struggle. The series will be able to meet you where you are at because it only provides you with the observation and leaves all implication to the viewer. \nA subtle yet raw beauty.\n93/100\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=23,   ["text"]="                          \n    Haibane Renmai Review\nSmall village, encased by huge walls... oh and with angels... Biblical reference much?\nThe Haibane are people who are born from a cocoon and grow wings. This is all set inside a rather large village surrounded by a great wall. Only the birds can leave the city, everyone else including the Haibane must spend there lives within the village. The village is full of normal people and the Haibane live away from the city and commute to the village.\nThe actual story of Haibane Renmai follows the life of a new born Haibane. When inside there cocoon the New born have a dream, they are\n          \n        then named after their dream. The main character of this Anime is called Rakka as in her dream she was falling, and.. as we all know, Rakka means falling in Japanese... right? None the less the story starts with Rakka being introduced to her fellow Haibane, the rules of the village and its customs.\n\nRakka is a timid little creature, unsure and almost helpless. You cant help but want her to find her place in this new world, and wonder how she came to be there in the 1st place. The supporting cast around Rakka don't make much of an impact apart from Reki, who is basically Rakka's guardian. Both are interesting and memorable characters. The other Haibane however were not so much, but the Anime is only 13 episodes long. I would have liked to seen more character development, and learned more about the other Haibane. But reviewers cant be choosers.\nI found Haibane very relaxing and easy to watch. I haven't watched an Anime like Haibane in a good while. No action, no love. It was just a very enjoyable and touching story about redemption and breaking free of past sins and mistakes. And I'm aware that sentence makes it sound very overbearing. However I can promise you its not, you can watch Haibane without really looking at the symbolism behind it and just enjoy. But I've watched Evangelion... symbolism slaps me in the face after that damn thing.\nThe animation is nothing spectacular, same as any Anime that has been released within the past 2 or 3 years. Which means its nice, just noting spectacular. That's not a bad thing, just no extra points on this front. The music is fitting for the story and is used very well. The opening and closing themes are not what I usually like in an Anime however it suited Haibane perfectly,\n\nHaibane Is a lovely tale of a girls journey to find her place and free her self of the feeling of guilt she has following her. Its a tale that most can relate to, because I'm sure everyone has something they regret and feel guilty about... even if its not as dramatic and ominous as the ones in Haibane. Anyone who appreciates the different genres of Anime out there should defiantly make some time to watch Haibane, Its a tale that will be imprinted on your memoires, and your top Anime.\n8.4/10\nDanny"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Episode for episode, this is probably the best anime I've ever seen.\nPremise:\nGirl, Rakka, wakes up, hatches from cocoon in other world. No memories of past. People around her, called Haibane, have wings and halos. She is Haibane too. She receives name Rakka based on her cocoon dream in which she was falling. Surreal kind of afterlife-ish world. Haibane have to live differently from humans. Girl struggle to adapt to life as a Haibane and reconcile it with feelings from her previous life.\nCharacters:\nThinking about the Characters, I feel like very few of them stick out. Inter-character relations are a big part of the story, but I'll\n          \n        just talk about the characters that stand out.\nRakka is a very believable sort of introverted girl. She want to have friends and belong and can act happy and be helpful, but she has a hard time really trusting people with her thoughts. She has a hard time making decisions that mean anything and tends to ignore her problems. For instance, Haibane must have a job, though they can't have money. Rakka goes around to all the other Haibane to see if she likes thier work, but she never really takes any of it seriously, she's just having fun being with the others and distracting herself. Eventually she is given the job of washing gravestones as penance. And she comes to like that. She functions as a point of view character than can draw the viewer into the other world as she comes to accept her place in it.\nReki, really warmhearted motherly character or older sister-like character with a dark side. She reminds me of my older stepsister. Anyway, Reki teaches the other Haibane and treats Rakka like a daughter almost. She's not exactly all that mature and she was a real problem child growing up. Still has a big problem with authority. She also has some real issues, in many ways worse than Rakka.\nThe Communicator is the priest who heads the Haibane Renmei, which is kind of the Haibane religion or society. He wears a mask and a robe so we never see his body. He might not be a Haibane. Only he is allowed to communicate with outsiders who come within the walls. He coordinates trade and in return the humans pay for the Haibane's upkeep. He also acts as the moral and spiritual guide to the Haibane ensuring the preservation off their rituals and the moral growth of the Haibane themselves.\nConclusion/Opinions:\nReally, there is as much to say about the society and world of Haibane Renmei as there is about its characters. I don't want to move into too much interpretation, because like a Romantic or Gothic work, a lot of the enjoyment here is in the mystery and the feelings the images and story invoke. Not everything feels like it can be explained. Most people, including myself, look at Haibane Renmei as a story about the afterlife. The creator, Yoshitoshi ABe, has outright denied that such was his intent, but he encourages everyone to come to their own conclusions. \nI also don't want to spoil anything for you, a lot of the story has to do with the nature of sin and forgiveness. The Communicator has a riddle he uses called the Circle of Sin which is quite insightful. To escape the city, a Haibane must sometimes solve the Circle of Sin, but no one can find it by simply thinking, and that is what traps Reki and what causes her to resent Rakka.\nThere is just so much going on here, the golden rust on the tombstones, the broken clock, the tallest building in the city built at its lowest point, the supernatural nature of the walls, the identity of the Toga. There's just so much room for speculation. And the world of Haibane Renmei lets the imagination roam free, though not unguided or unfettered. Rather pretentious of me to say, but this series is largely about involving you with life within the walls and taking you into its world.\nThere's not really much romance, I don't know if the Haibane are allowed to have sex. Certainly, I think some of them, like Reki, might be forbidden. As far as plot, they don't really go anywhere. There are two real arcs, Rakka's story and Reki's, but they kinda flow into eachother. \nThe art I think is what really makes it a masterpiece and the sound. The background piece called Blight I think is the best depiction of fear and pain I've ever heard. Really heart-wrenching to remember it. The way fear plays into pain. And Yoshitoshi ABe's art is simply unrivaled. I used one of his sketches for my icon. He's noted for being one of the few artists who never uses a ruler. It gives his eyes a unique luster that you just don't see anywhere else. And his taste in costumes and in architecture and art remind me of Shadow of the Colossus. A lot of Haibane Renmei looks and feels like Shadow of the Colossus or Ico. \nThis is the only anime he wrote the story for and honestly, its probably his most optimistic piece. If you've ever read any of his manga or seen his other animes he worked on, ABe is usually a lot darker and more gruesome than this. But here the horror is much more fear of the unknown and sort of Gothic in nature.\nThere is no reason not to watch this unless you just can't take anime seriously, and even them, it's Yoshitoshi ABe, just watch it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Haibane Renmei, an anime greatly praised by critics yet un-watched by the majority of people due to it's quiet, boring, and old appearance. But you know what they say, \"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\" I decided to give Haibane Renmei a try because I heard that it was rather deep and touching, and I do like deep and touching stories. How quickly I found out that Haibane Renmei is a true gentle compelling story that has hands on both the sadness and happiness of life/reality. If you want to watch a high-tech anime with tons of epic moments, then Haibane Renmei may be\n          \n        a bit too mature for you.\nHow do we know that this world is a reality? What are \"dreams\"? What is life? Who am I? Does God exist?\nHaibane Renmei has answers to several of these questions which linger beneath the outer skin of the show. The show is a wondrous journey through many themes of life, love, redemption, repent upon sins, acceptance, dreams, conquering fears, realizing forgiveness, and death. \nThere are approximately 140 million people born every year; innocent and pure babies who don't realize the evils and dangers that await them in reality. As these babies grow up into kids, they start to vaguely understand that where are beauties and happiness in this world, but at the same time there are horrors, and suffering; but they tend to turn a blind eye to it because they don't fully understand. As these kids mature into adults, that's when they acknowledge all the things that reality throws at us. During adulthood, people live their lives the way they want to, according to their own philosophies. When these adults grow older into the elderly, they often reflect upon their lives, finally having their own answers to the questions of reality. But what does this have to do with Haibane Renmei?\nThe city of Glie is a bustling settlement that resides in a place beyond the reach and the comprehension of mankind. Its residents, the Haibane, a population of \"people\" with an appearance like an angel. The Haibane live a simple existence, working for other who seek/need their assistance. From the moment a Haibane awakens/is born, he/she must determine their purpose in life and determine what ties them to the city of Glie. Those who manage to attain these answers are given their Day of Flight: a day where a Haibane is allowed to soar beyond the walls of Glie to the outside world beyond confinement. \nThe story revolves around a newborn Haibane, Rakka (Named after the word \"falling\", because the opening scene of the anime is of a young girl falling through the sky, head downward alongside a crow, who just so happens to be Rakka). The first half of the anime is a splice of life style, with Rakka adjusting with her repetitive daily life, meeting new people and creating friendships with other Haibane. All the meanwhile, subtle hints towards the greater plot in the second half of the show are placed carefully and deliberately amidst Rakka’s quiet experiences. All seems soothing and peaceful at first, but then come around episode 6, and the entire mood and pacing of the anime changes. When Rakka's friend, Kuu goes on her Day of Flight, Rakka falls into distress and begins to question everything related to life; her friends, her city, reality, etc... Deeply depressed and confused, Rakka later runs away from Old Home in despair, and follows the crows into the forbidden Western Woods; there, her fate will be sealed, and she will follow her destiny. \nThe entire story of Haibane Renmei is a metaphor for our own human existence. Glie is a microscopic simulation of the real world, surrounded by impassable walls. And although people know that they are alive, their name, and what they're going to do in life. In a very real sense, we humans don't understand much of why we are who we are (what's our real identity), and we have only the slightest notions of what waits beyond the walls of our own mortal existence, beyond the atmosphere of earth. At the end of the day, Haibane Renmei may look like a story about angels, but it's honestly a story about human beings. \nThe character development was phenomenal. Each character are trying to find answers to questions of identity and life. The friendship/family bondship developed between the Haibane, betrayals, forgiveness are all essential factors that Haibane Renmei masterfully weaves into the deeper themes of the plot. Haibane Renmei shines in representing what true friendship really means. The two main characters, Rakka and Reki are both Haibane who struggle in life, filled with much sorrow and pain. The way the story portrays how they overcome their obstacles is phenomenal. Really, all the characters have normal/realistic personalities and act in believable ways, making them very easy to relate to. I know for sure that I cared, and connected with more than one character. \nThe art and soundtrack of the anime were stunning. The portrayal of the Haibane was mystical; the halos, wings, and character's faces were outstanding. The realism that the art gives to the entire anime is magical. The soothing, masterful music (piano) in Haibane Renmei added so much feeling to the anime, and they were a delight to listen to. The voicing of the characters, wondrous. *Round of applause for the voice actors*.\nThere were tons of symbolic and metaphoric objects in Haibane Renmei. For example, the untouchable walls that bind the Haibane inside the city of Glie are the representation of temptation. The Cocoons of which the Haibane are born from - A symbol of death and rebirth. Crows, eastern religions in particular seem to view crows as a symbol of love and creation, but in almost all mythologies, crow are the carrion eaters associated with death and life. The shape of a halo is that of a \"miragical\" circle. This is associated with eternity, a never ending existence, which fits the eastern concepts of reincarnation. This is an extremely old symbol associated with divinity. Wings - This ties in with the freedom associations of flight tied to birds. They are also associated with the immortality of the soul. Black or white, but also grey? This possibly ties in with the concept of yin and yang. The balance, the concept of constant change, all are reflected in the Haibane's wings. Also, the Riddle of the \"Circle of Sin\" is extraordinarily profound. The answer to the riddle is: anyone can damn them-self, but no one can save them-self. Anyone can decide they are unworthy of salvation, but having done so, they can only then be saved if someone else believes that they deserve salvation. The solution is not to be free of sin, but rather to be forgiven for your sins. Then it doesn't matter if you are a sinner or not, and the paradox collapses because it becomes moot. But that forgiveness can only come from outside, and only if you accept it from outside. That is why Reki becomes trapped; she won't accept forgiveness, thinking that nobody truly knows who she really is. Clearly, lots of things to watch out for. \nWhether you like that it is, or dislike that it's all theological and philosophical, Haibane Renmei is a true masterpiece that's very rare to come by. Haibane Renmei is, without a doubt, one of the most incredible and deep animated series I have ever seen. Its combination of charming characters, fantastic storytelling, and lurking themes of reality create a memorable, to say the least experience that nobody should miss out on. In a short span of 13 episodes - around 4 hours of anime, Haibane Renmei changed my life, and I'm sure it'll do the same for you if you just pay attention. Please do yourself a favor and watch it.\n        "},

It starts out slow, developing the characters in a typical slice-of-life style. They also slowly build the eeriness and intrigue with this strange world the Haibanes have woken up into. Half way through the serious, you will intimately know and love all of the characters.  The first 8 episodes are rather slow, but they absolutely necessary to build up to the most intense, emotionally charged, heartfelt powerful ending of any series I've ever come across. I have never sobbed so bitterly about events that aren't even real. Tears\n          \n        of sorrow, tears of joy, tears of relief, tears of laughter. This is an anime for the soul. \nThe artistry is a subtle pastel, strengthening the understated nature of the series.  As for the music, there is nothing else like it.  I have the entire soundtrack on my computer and listen to it and cry when I need that release.  \nThis series is slow and understated, but overwhelmingly powerful.  It'll shake you to your core.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Haibane Renmei is an anme based off of a doujinshi manga by Abe Yoshitoshi, the same bloke who wrote the Serial Experiments Lain manga. The anime version was handled by Radix, the same studio behind Divergence Eve. Which doesn't exactly inspire confidence but we'll give it a shot. After all, most anime studios work on series of varying quality. Let's just hope it doesn't feature a bunch of awkward CG scenes or any of the other elements that were bad in Divergence Eve.\nStory:\nWe open with a girl falling. Shortly after, we cut to a winged woman finding a cocoon. She and her winged friends gather\n          \n        around the cocoon to prepare for the new life that's going to emerge from it. We quickly see the girl from the beginning inside the cocoon. After her emergence, she's told that she's a haibane and given the name “Rakka” based on her cocoon dream. The series continues to explore haibane culture and the town they're a part of as Rakka gets to know her compatriots and finds her place.\nThe biggest criticism that I can levy against the series is that it's slow at times. There are a lot of scenes that don't really do anything for the narrative itself. They're more about being cutesy and reiterating aspects of the various characters. That being said, I can't deny that a lot of those scenes are quite good and they do help with the atmosphere.\nThere's a lot of good in the series. I like that every question that gets brought up during the course of the series gets addressed. I also a appreciate that the series doesn't always give definitive answers when it addresses those questions. Rather, they let you figure out a lot of it for yourself while giving you enough information to do so. The series has a very strong calming atmosphere with strong bitter-sweet and uplifting moments throughout. The ending in particular is a perfect mix of those two aspects. One other thing the series excels at is investment. Throughout the series there are questions that get brought up and various sources of tension that stem from them and it really serves to bring you into the world. Not only does it get you interested in what's happening but it legitimately makes you care about it. Which isn't a simple feat.\nCharacters:\nPsychological series really depend on strong characters, quite possibly more than any other genre. Fortunately, that's an area where Haibane Renmei excels. The characters and their interactions are a major focus of the series. Which not only serves to develop and flesh out the characters, but it also gives you a sense of connection to them. You really feel a sense of empathy for the haibane, Rakka & Reki in particular. Even the secondary characters have enough development that they feel like actual people.\nArt:\nThankfully, the art in this is really nicely done. Unlike that other series from Radix. The character designs look nice. The backgrounds are nicely detailed. They draw crows really well, which is worth mentioning because crows are a bit of a motif for the series. The scene where Rakka's wings come in is superbly animated as is the climax. Overall, the aesthetic is just really well done. When the series is going for a soothing feel, it does it well. When it's trying to be disconcerting the visuals can get really interesting. The only thing I can really criticise is that hats are used on multiple occasions to hide characters' halos and it doesn't make visual sense. You can't really see any bulge from them like you should be able to.\nSound:\nThe two performances that really stand out are Hirohashi Ryou (who also voiced Tails in Sonic) & Noda Junko (who also voiced Zakuro in Tokyo Mew Mew.) There are no bad performances, though. Yajima Akiko, Miyajima Eri, Orikasa Fumiko & Murai Kazusa are all good in this too. The music within the series was handled by Otani Kow, who also did the music for Another, Gunslinger Girl Il Teatrino & Gundam Wing. He did a superb job with this one. The music really suits and contributes to the atmosphere.\nHo-yay:\nThere really isn't any. While the main girls do have strong bonds, there's never really a point that elevates those bonds above friendship.\nFinal Thoughts:\nHaibane Renmei is a pretty superb series. While it can be slow at points, it has a strong atmosphere, excellent characters, a compelling narrative with a lot of praise-worthy elements, really good art & a strong cast. Compared to my other experience with either the writer or studio, this series is superior. I thoroughly enjoyed it and my final rating is going to be an enthusiastic 9/10. Next week we'll begin horror anime month with a look at the horror mystery Kagewani. And remember to stay fabulous.\n        "},

After a little while she breaks free and meets angelic beings with ashen gray wings and halos. In a short time, she grows a pair of her own wings, receives her own halo and becomes a member of the Charcoal wings.

After some time, Rakka finds out that the small valley she lives in is surrounded by a huge wall and that only a small group of people called the Toga can go outside of the city limits. Why did Rakka become a haibane and what mystery does that enigmatic valley hide?  \nHaibane Renmei (Charcoal Feather Federation) begins as a typical slice of life and you will probably think that every episode will run in the same vein. But I guarantee you that Haibane Renmei has an ace in its hand and it will surely make you feel sorry about your prejudice. But let’s forget about the bad!\nThis anime consists of two parts: the first is world building and the second is denouement. The world building might be boring for you and you will probably want to skip a minute or two. That will be quite a big mistake; you should never skip even a second. Before watching this show, PLEASE, ask yourself if you are ready to be attentive. Inattention will result in your incomprehension of the world of Haibane Renmei and in result you will only waste your precious time. However, if you are ready to be attentive and you have never been afraid of a complex story, Haibane Renmei won’t disappoint you, on the contrary, it will reward you with one of the greatest story ever.\nI can’t give the storyline anything less than 10/10. It did leave some unanswered questions, but it wasn’t bad. The show gives its viewer a great opportunity to think: it will raise the question, give you all the possible hints (not always), and you will have to answer on these questions by yourself. It was a very pleasing experience for me, to take a break and to give the episode that I have just seen a thought, and I am sure that you will find it interesting, as well. \n-Animation(8/10)-\nThe animation is mostly top notch. The portrayal of landscapes will make you hold your breathe. The character design is unique; it does look plain, but that plainness gave this show a touch of realism and it worked well. Without a doubt, this anime was made in 2002, which makes the animation a bit outdated. That is why, if you are a fan of “cute girls”, you should avoid Haibane. \n-Music(10/10)-\nI highly recommend to all of you to download the whole anime’s OST. It is something you will never describe with your own words, you need to hear it by yourself. Some tracks will make your day brighter, the others will make you think about something in your life, or will even make you sad. The soundratck is simply brilliant.\nI saw Haibane Renmei both in English and in Japanese, and to my big surprise the both versions are equally good. Alas, I can’t tell you which version is better. Both English and Japanese voice actors did amazing job and I highly appreciated it: their characters looked alive and realistic, it was very pleasant for me.\n-Character(10/10)-\nThe entire cast is charming and pleasant. Haibane Renmei shows a wide range of personalities: from the cheerful Kuu and tomboyish Kana, to the gentle yet\nmelancholic Reki. The bonds that Rakka builds with other characters – especially Reki, which become critical to the plot in its later stages – are very interesting to follow. All characters received enough screen-time and it was very entertaining to follow them from the very beginning until the very end.\n-Enjoyment (10/10)-\nThe good:\n1)Storyline.\n2)Characters.\n3)Music.\nThe bad:\n1)None.\nHaibane Renmei is one of these rare gems that you will want to never end. I was shocked by the deep and dark story-line, the animation added more darkness to the show, the music helped me to get accustomed to the Haibane Renmei’s world and the characters were the final drop for me to fall in love with this show. It is truly one of the best of Abe Yoshitoshi’s works.\n-Overall(9,8/10)-\nOn the whole, saying that Haibane Renmei is a masterpiece only because of symbolism will be the same as saying nothing. Haibane Renmei takes care of every little detail, making this anime that fascinating. A beautiful fable about the true nature of forgiveness and resignation.\n*Side note: This show has almost nothing to do with the religion. (if you are one of these folks…)\nWithout a doubt, this show isn’t for everyone. As I have already mentioned, it may be difficult for one to be attentive. This is NOT a series that should be watched without attention. If you are ready for that “sacrifice”, you will have to see the entire anime. By entire anime, I mean every minute, every second, everything! If you see everything, you will be able to understand and fall in love with Haibane Renmei.\nOverall, I dropped Haibane Renmei twice. And only when I saw it without skipping even a second I was able to fully understand the idea of this show. If you feel bored, make a pause; Haibane Renmei isn’t something you can easily marathon. If you are ready for this show, I wish you to understand every single detail, which was shown in that splendid fable called Haibane Renmei.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Warning: spoilers ahead\nSo I was on MAL and was just browsing through anime, clicking randomly on links until I stumbled upon this. To me, this anime is one of those hidden gems you see every now and then, comparable to Bokurano in terms of underrated goodness. \nPlot: 8/10\nAs much as I loved this anime, I cannot in good conscience give it a 10/10. There are too many questions that needed answers. Don't get me wrong, that was actually one of the things I loved about it. For example, We never learn what was up with the bird other than a few hints. We never learn\n          \n        anything about Reki's dream besides the fact she probably died by being hit by a train and was unwilling to ask for help. But there were something I think should have gotten answered that didn't, in particular the inside of the walls. It's mentioned that things live there, and that's why you need to wear that robe when you're picking the leaves. But we never learn what things live down there or why you shouldn't take off the robe. We are also treated to that scene where Rakka finds that glowing panel covered in leaves at the end of the walls in episode 11. There's no explanation given, and it felt like the author put it in but then couldn't think of what it actually was or did. Seeing as how this was made by the same guy who did Serial Experiments Lain, I should not have been too surprised about that. Regardless, the story was pretty great and kept me watching, wanting to know more. \nAnother thing to note about the plot is that it very slow paced. This is a slice of life show, showing the daily lives of these girls, while slowly revealing more and more about this world they live in through the eyes of Rakka. It was actually pretty geniusly done, showing the audience the world through somebody who has never been there before. That way there's an excuse for the characters to deliver exposition to the audience while not breaking their suspension of disbelief. It feels like a natural part of the plot. This might be something that puts people off, but to a fan of slice of life like me, it was the perfect blend of relaxing and fascinating. It's not often you find a show that is both slice of life and full of plot at the same time. \nCharacters: 10/10\nThis is where the show really shines. All of the characters are interesting and developed. They are not one-dimensional cutouts. They have thoughts and feelings that feel real, desires and motivations that make sense. Even the side characters who only show up for a few episodes feel real enough to be actual people. I don't want to make this too long so I'm not going to talk about all of them. Someone who deserves mention, however, is Reki. Her story is one of the most tragic and she is one of the most developed and interesting characters. Her motivations for doing what she does are realistic and sympathetic. Even when she hurts the people around her, you can't help but feel bad for her, since you know it isn't out of ill will. She genuinely cares about people, but every time she trusts them they end up dying or leaving her. In a way she almost reminds me of Sayaka Miki, although I'm probably alone in that...\nArt: 9/10\nThere isn't much to say about the art. It's very simple, but appealing to look at. It's the same art style as Lain, which I also liked. The simple character designs fit the tone of the story and the animation is smooth. At least to me it is.\nSound: 9/10\nThe music in this series is breathtaking. That's the only word I can use to describe it. Every track is memorable and perfectly fits the scene. One of the ways I decide how much I love the music in a show is by whether or not I can listen to it all by itself. The Haibane Renmei soundtrack is one of those. There are some scenes where I feel like there was music when there didn't need to be, like the scene where Kana is showing Rakka the inside of the clock she's trying to fix, but it's not a big deal and didn't ruin the show for me.\nOverall, Haibane Renmei is one of the better shows I have watched to date. I have seen many, many anime over the course of my lifetime and this is one of the ones that left me speechless after finishing the final episode. There have been a few others where, after it ended, I just sort of stared at my screen for a few minutes in awe. If I were grading this anime solely on my enjoyment of the series, it would have a 10/10 easily. However, there were flaws that I couldn't ignore, which brought the score down to a 9. I recommend watching this series, it truly is an underrated masterpiece. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Haibane Renmei was created by Yoshitoshi ABe, who is know for is philosophical works, that doesn't get the popularity it deserves, probably because the average anime watcher isn't interested in a philosophical and thought-provoking story. This is proved by the fact that Angel Beats, a show that has similar themes but presents them in a generic, rushed and badly written manner gets more credit than this.\nThe story starts in a place called Old Home, which is the nest of the haibane. The haibane are creatures that look like humans but have a halo on their head and wings on their back, they are also treated\n          \n        differently than the humans. The anime is set in a town that is surrounded by walls but no one knows why or what lies beyond those walls. At the beginning of the series, Reki finds a cocoon, inside that cocoon lies our soon to be born protagonist, Rakka. From that point on, Rakka interacts with various other people and learns how the world works. The series is presented in a simple manner but it's way deeper than it shows, it's slow at first showing us the world and characters but it starts getting more darker and mysterious as it goes on, touching masterfully on subjects like death, sin and redemption. A bunch of questions are not answered by the end leaving a lot of things up to interpretation, you may see this as a positive or as a negative but it allows each different viewer to get a different experience and it makes so that the anime has rewatch value.\nThe characters are varied and realistic, the two main characters Rakka and Reki have a spectacular dynamic being that Rakka is a very good person but is also weak of heart, letting sad moments make her completely depressed and Reki being more reserved but always there to help her and the other haibane. Apart from the haibane there is also the Toga who are the only people that can go in and out of the town, the Haibane Federation who are an organization that is responsible for the well being of the haibane and are also the only ones who can talk to the Toga, and finally there are the humans. This show's main focus is the characters, showing us how they go through life and solve their inner problems. Due to the realism of this anime, the characters have flaws that they strive to overcome during the story. The majority of the characters are well developed, have an influence in the story and in how Rakka thinks of this new world she lives in.\nThe art is simple yet beautiful creating a great atmosphere that helps you immerse yourself in this world. The soundtrack really helps that too with some really great music that is always fitting of the scene that it is being played at. The animation is average even for the time the anime was produced but it doesn't really take away from it because movement isn't the focus at all. \nOverall, Haibane Renmei is a simple yet very touching story that handles mature themes with ease. It's something really unique that no one has been able to replicate to the same degree, even though they tried. It's possibly a masterpiece and it's something that everyone should watch. \n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    I find Haibane Renmei very weak and flawed, both as an anime and a work of ‘art’. There’s a fantastical, mysterious drama that wants to be told somewhere in there, but it kind of falls flat on its face due its lackluster storytelling, flat characters, and general lack of ambition. Make no mistake, Haibane Renmei has both a strong start and an excellent premise. It’s just a shame that it’s a story that doesn’t really have anything meaningful to say.\nThe first episode immediately hooks the viewer with a strong start, an intriguing premise, and a fascinating world to be discovered. Haibane Renmei has a seemingly\n          \n        endless ocean of potential to be discovered. Who are these characters? Why are they here? What is this world? There are many questions about the nature of Haibane Renmei right from the start. Too bad these questions are pushed to the side for the sake of ambiguity and hollow ‘depth’. The first half of Haibane Renmei consists of Rakka finding a job in the town near Old Home, the area of residence where she and her fellow Haibane live. You could say it’s a metaphorical journey of her finding her place in both the world and life. You could also say it’s a lifeless waste of time(Kind of like the show itself)where nothing is really accomplished. Why explore the world and characters when you can lazily write your story and then say, “It’s supposed to accomplish nothing, because it’s symbolism!” It’s a very weak first half that doesn’t do anything important, and hurts the story even more when the laughable excuse for drama is shoehorned in in the second half.\nSadly, the character department doesn’t fare much better. Other than Reki and Rakka, the two characters that actually do anything in the show, pretty much all the characters are completely flat. I honestly can’t remember any of the characters names besides Reki, Rakka, and Kuu. Maybe it’s just me. Or maybe it’s the fact that the show wastes so much time on pointless symbolism and languid progression that it barely explores the characters or the setting, leaving the entire ocean of potential completely untapped. What’s even more pitiful is the aforementioned drama of the second half. Why the hell should I care about Rakka finding a bird’s skeleton in a well? Why should I care if a character's day of flight comes when all I remember is their name? You can’t expect someone to care about a character they don’t even know. Do you feel sad when you hear about a person who died in an accident on the news? You probably do. But it fades away after a bit of time, doesn’t it? Feeling sorry for a stranger just isn’t that easy. The same logic can be applied to Haibane Renmei. It falls completely apart.\nFrom a production standpoint, Haibane Renmei actually fares quite well. Although the same can’t be said about their personalities, each character has a distinct design and appearance, courtesy of  Yoshitoshi ABe. The background artwork is detailed and pretty, only made better by the art style. The art is washed in a soft, watercolor-esque style that gives it a very ethereal quality. It may not excel technically, but it works fine for the slow nature of the show. The soundtrack is mostly forgettable, including harmonious piano and string music that complement the show decently. It’s competent, but nothing more.\nIn the end, I can’t really recommend Haibane Renmei to anyone. It forsakes satisfying, fulfilling entertainment all for hollow ambiguity and symbolism. Being subtle can lead to art being imaginative and thought-provoking, and can promote discussion long after it has lost its novelty. It’s a shame that Haibane Renmei is too concerned with being ‘deep’ than it is with much of anything else. Why the general public celebrates this travesty escapes me."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This is hands-down my favorite anime of all time. I can sum up Haibane Renmei in two words, beautiful, and tragic.\nHaibane Renmei is another masterpiece from Yoshitoshi Abe. Abe has his own unique style of storytelling, and in all honesty it doesn't appeal to everyone. The pacing is slow, relying heavily on metaphor, symbolism, and atmosphere. Haibane Renmei is a perfect example of this. \nIn Haibane Renmei you follow Rakka, a girl who dreams of falling from the sky and subsequently awakens in a cocoon remembering nothing of her previous life. She lives in an old, dusty building lovingly referred to as \"Old Home\" with\n          \n        several other charcoal feathers, called the haibane. I always tell people that the main character is not necessarily Rakka, but Reki. I've watched and re-watched this series a dozen times, and I still find myself crying every time I watch those last two episodes. They're unbelievably powerful.\nWhile the show's style may not be for everyone I still strongly encourage giving it a watch. It's a very short anime and while the pacing may be slow you'll be surprised by just how quickly it goes by. Additionally, there are many things you can miss on a first watch, so if you find yourself loving Haibane Renmei—or if you've already seen it—another watch can bring to light things you might have missed. I know the first time I watched it I completely missed a lot of the symbolism, focusing more on the relationship between Rakka and Reki as well as the uniqueness of each side character.\nThere is no such thing as a perfect anime, and Haibane Renmei has its flaws.  I think the one thing that may turn people off the most is the religious undertones sprinkled throughout the series. Especially once you hit the halfway mark. I personally feel it's to be expected, as it lends itself to the aesthetic. \nLong story short, if you have the time and enough patience to give Haibane Renmei a watch you most-likely won't regret it. The art and soundtrack alone are gorgeous! My favorite song from the soundtrack is Ailes Grises. \nI hesitate to rate animes 10/10, but Haibane Renmei is one of those animes that truly deserves it. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    Death and suicide are the ultimate questions. Anyone who writes them off as a first world problem doesn’t interact with human beings. Humans are the only organism that’s aware their life will end someday. We make a mostly conscious decision whether to live or die, and that includes people in war torn countries.\nDeath is so confusing though. Can you imagine the complete ending of all of your consciousness, all of the data inside your head? That’s why I can’t blame Haibene Renmei if its exploration of themes is fuzzy. If someone couldn’t climb Mt. Everest but still took a picture of a summit, that’s something.\nThe\n          \n        portrayal of common concepts such as purgatory, heaven and hell are slightly modified. They make a big psychological difference. Almost by accident, Haibane Renmei comes close to understanding the suicidal mind. This is a great achivement. Years of research and everyone is still stuck at ‘suicide is irrational’ and then wonder why people kill themselves.\nThe most radical approach of the show is how it overturns the communal argument against suicide. The communal argument is one of the few argument that are valid against suicide. It points out that since the person is a part of a community, the community owes them and the person owes the community. The result is symbiosis, a ‘no one gets left behind’ approach that forces people to comply but rewards for being a part of society.\nYet the community of Giles is different. It’s meant to allow people to tie up loose ends and exit painlessly and cleanly. At the same time, the person is obligated to contribute to this society in order to make their exit. If they won’t, they will be doomed to a long life of isolation – a common complaint of suicidal people.\nThis ‘painless clean exit’ is important. Notice how the characters whose view is negative have a different exit. They hate themselves and are filled with guilt. The only exit they can imagine is a violent one. Yet the source of their guilt is causing harm ot others, which is exactly what they’re doing. The harsh suicide causes a paradox. Both parties refuse to accept and forgive.\nWe also get a harsh view of the people left behind. Suicide prevention is, by nature, selfish. People who stop people from killing themselves only do it to benefit themselves. In a moment of suicide, all the good attributes that Rakka mentions are good ones. She can tell the person how they benefit the world, but that’s the only thing she experiences. She doesn’t experience how the suicidal person experiences themselves, the inner demons of guilt and self-hatred.\nThis is just one interpetation. In many places Haibene Renmei suffers from the same flaws of Texhnolyze and Lain. It’s rich in symbolism and clear signs of depth, but it’s vague. Even if suicide is made slightly obvious by the end, it’s still hard to connect every thread to it. Nevertheless, the slight vagueness isn’t a problem this time around. The anime is deeply humane.\nNothing in serenity or in the Fantasy genre prevents it from being character driven. It may be serene for most of its first half, but every character reacts to the situations in their unique way. Their personalities are established quickly and stay consistent. Their character design is according to their personalities.\nABe is mostly a dull designer and not good at creating the unique touches that make each face different. Here his style works for him. It’s still subtle and minimalist, but meaningful. Rakka’s messy brown hair fits her confused persona. Kana’s more muscular look fits with her rougher nature.\nThe setting of the series also gives him more to do. While the color grey still dominates, there are contrast to it. It’s not the barrage of grimdarkness that was Texhnolyze. There is warmth in those greys. The peaceful setting and characters make the grey slightly gloomier, but it still looms just like death. The animation is sometimes too choppy, but such technical difficulties can be forgiven when the art is so beautiful.\nABe needed a balance between life an death in the art. Haibane Renmei is dominated by characters who are clearly alive and feel real. The events are often cheery and carefree. The contrast between the greys and the cheerful part isn’t obvious. It’s not a bad thing happening after a good one. Rather, the two opposites are right next to each other. We see the good times the Haibene experience, we see the kindness of the people next to the caging walls.\nIt’s so lifelike that despite the vagueness, it’s a powerful drama story. The emotions run deep with living characters and setting. The Fantasy setting is taken advantage of – it’s fantastical, clearly symbolic and not just a set of rules. There a lot of confusing anime which are confusing on purpose, just to look cool. If Haibene Renmei is confusing, it’s only because of how original it is. I hope to return to it soon with more to say.\n4 angels out of 5\n        "},

This world, this story, it has so much potential (potential that is perhaps explored in the manga assuming there is one) It could be so interesting, but it's not.

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    With the original concept coming from the notorious artist Yoshitoshi Abe (character designer for Serial Experiment Lain, among the other things), Haibane Renmei comes from a pedigree that's both important and uncertain, as Abe, before this, had never worked on an animated series as the central \"auteur\" (I am totally using that word improperly, and in any other context i would shout at it being used so shallowly... but you get what I mean). What has resulted from this endeavor though is definitely worthwhile. Abe ultimately uses this series to meditate on the themes of sin, suicide, loss and afterlife, and while I have some\n          \n        uncertainties on the conclusions at which he arrives, as they can be a bit simplistic and not as complex as the setting he builds around them, they are presented beautifully and tell a story that is in its own rights full of likable characters and eerie mysteries.\nSet in a city where humans and Haibane (winged beings, quite similar to angels, with no memory of their \"past life\") coexist, Haibane Renmei follows the life of one of those Haibane, using it as a pretext to slowly paint a picture of this unique setting.\nThe series uses the structural trappings taken from \"slice of life\" anime to present us with something that goes far beyond simple comedy or \"moe\". While there is no linear plot to speak of, the various stories told in the episodes help the viewer, little by little, to understand the full picture of this inventive afterlife pictured by Abe.\nWhat is wonderful about Haibane Renmei is that, despite being mostly about exploring a setting, it never resorts to the shortcut of heavy-handedness. And I am not talking only about its complex and actually... \"human\" characters, but also about the direction and cinematography, that take their time and know when to make emotions simmer. This also translates to the very characteristic art-style that despite being quite rough and stylised also has a certain softness to it, which is supported by the muted and \"autumnal\" colour palette. Additionally, I find quite remarkable how Abe's visual style can smoothly transition from the sweetly melancholic to the dark and creepy in a matter of seconds without ever feeling dissonant. This makes it quite appropriate for this series, especially in the last couple of episodes, which delve in the darkest depth of the setting and characters.\nThere is a lot to like Haibane Renmei for, especially as it exists in a medium populated by so many series that over explain every single plot point and that rely on very heavy-handed characterization to convey their themes. In this context Haibane Renmei's delicate and intimate approach to storytelling shines even more, making it an extremely recommended watch, despite some uncertainties in how it handles its themes."},

Haibane Renmei is such a reminder.\nIt all began when I watched Serial Experiments Lain.\nA show I never thought I‘d like, which ended up as one of my favorites. So after being blown away by it I was looking for more.\nTexhnolyze offered a similar experience, a similar reminder of something that is so different than everything else that it makes you question why you even bother with generic-ness.\nHaibane Renmei was something that took me some time to watch it.\nAnd when the day came, it was something\n          \n        that I swallowed as a whole and digested it slowly. So slow, that I am still working on its lasting impression in this moment.\nThere is much to say about it and yet it it‘s strangely hard to express it in is fullness.\nHaibane Renmei is a once in a lifetime experience, one of those rare gems that offers something so unique and beautiful, that it will make it hard to appreciate anything else for a long time because you are over thinking it too much.\nSo what is it that makes Haibane Renmei so special?\nIt‘s a combination of various factors, delicately tuned to one another in such a way, that it feels more like a piece of art, rather than a form of entertainment, something you have to invest a lot of thought in, to fully appreciate it.\nHaibane Renmei is not hard to understand but offers no absolute answers so there is a lot of think and speculate about.\nAnyways I am talking a lot but don‘t tell you anything so I better get started with the review:\nSetting / Story\nA girl dreams of falling, accompanied by a black crow who is trying to lift her towards the sky, yet cannot accomplish his futile struggle to save the girl from imminent death by impact.\nA group of feathered females find a large cocoon from which the dreaming girl is born.\nShe is born a Haibane, an angel like creature, given a name by her dream.\nRakka - falling.\nHer new home is called old home, inhabited by other Haibanes, who explain to her the new world she is now part of.\nThe story follows Rakkas new life in the mysterious town of Glie, a town surrounded by a wall .\nNo one, but the crows, that are free to fly over it and the masked merchants, called Toga who no one but the Haibane Renmei is allowed to communicate with, knows what‘s behind the wall.\nHaibanes are born into a curious world, a world with fixed rules, yet never to be explained what it is or why these rules exist.\nHaibane Renmei carefully crafts a unique fantasy setting, which's time period not really advanced (unlike Lain and Texhnolyze, which are scifi oriented) and settles somewhere between the later 19th century and more modern settings with some technological advancements.\nThe city itself seems old and rural, and the people are all somewhat old fashioned, use outdated technology, have little to no electricity and besides scooters there seems to be almost no modern vehicle.\nOne of the strongest points of Haibane Renmei really is the setting. The interesting fantasy setting makes you long for more explanations. What are the Haibanes? What is beyond the walls? Where does the city come from? Why is no one allowed to speak to the Toga? And much more...\nIt lulls you in its dream like but still realistic world offering a comfortable simple paradise, something that I rarely see in most anime.\nI know it‘s maybe very far apart from Haibane Renmei but I had to think of Heidi, Girl of the Alps when I watched it.\nThe story itself is rather slow. The first half start out as a slice of life, showing you the aspects of the world, how people live, what the rules for the Haibanes are and so on.\nThe second half revolves around the drama which emerges after the main character Rakka is confronted with one of the more tragic aspects of the Haibanes. I won‘t tell you what it is because that would be a spoiler, but it turns Rakka into a very depressed person.\nThe second half also answers a lot of the questions, though leaves enough for speculation.\nThe thing I‘d love to give the most points for though is the premise of the show.\nHaibane Renmei deals with sins and redemption, similar to Angel Beats, yet more mature than most anime tend to be nowadays.\nIt not only creates an original universe, but also deals with Angels, portrait in a unique slice of life, something that couldn't have been done in a more original and creative way possible.\nFrom the first episode on, where it is shown how much pain it causes, for the Haibanes, to grow their wings; to how their halos are made.\nIt puts most other shows into shame, which often have a rather lazy or unoriginal premise or setting.\nPeople say that, despite Sword art Onlines weak story, the premise was great. Trapped in a MMORPG, but really compared to a slice of life with angels it pales significantly.\nOver all the story isn't too complex, there is just a handful of important characters, the universe is limited by default and everything what is part of the plot is explained clearly without too many riddles that make it unnecessary complicated. It also doesn't use technobable to sound smart. It‘s very settled and easy to understand without being brain dead.\nA perfect balance of complexity and simplicity.\nAnd unlike it‘s sister shows Lain and Texhnolyze, Haibane Renmei doesn‘t use too many weird symbolism and surreal effects to confuse the viewer. (though occasionally there are dream sequences and dream like scenes which are abstract)\nThe ending rounds up the whole shows, gives you a not unexpected, yet fulfilling ending.\nAll in all Haibane Renmei is slow, but beautiful. It deals with serious issues in the most innocent way possible without being to childish or just a fairytale.\nCharacters\nRakka the main character is curious and confused. She remembers something she cannot remember. Something that feels like it happened before she became a Haibane.\nShe starts out scared and confused, later turns to become curious but not very confident. But then something happens that throws over her idyllic pace in the world she now lives in. She questions her own sins, seeks redemption and tries to help out the people she used to rely on.\nShe is not the strongest female character ever to exist but she is believable. Real struggle. Real emotions. A bit overblown at times but never unrealistic.\nI could say this about all the characters, because it is true. Haibane Renmei has cast of realistic multifaceted personalities.\nReki the somewhat cold but motherly Haibane, caring for the children, fighting an inner struggle. Always keeping an eye for Rakka\nKuu is the tomboy-ish young Haibane which forms a great friendship with Rakka.\nNemu is the sleepy but capable older Haibane who spend a long time living with Reki.\nAnd the others are just as great.\nThere isn‘t really much to say here, but the chemistry between Rakka and Reki which becomes essential to the story in the second half of the show, which gives a good backdrop on both characters. There others come a bit shorter though, but it doesn‘t remove any impact the story would have otherwise.\nIt‘s also not rushed as in Angel beats, where you have a huge cast, but only a handful get any recognition.\nOverall the characters are believable, natural and relatable. Even though it is a slice of life, it doesn‘t feel like a sitcom or a moe show of the modern times, but rather a very unique version of how a slice of life can be. It doesn‘t use comedy or overblown drama to create chemistry but the explorable nature of the setting which creates character interactions.\nAnimation and Artwork\nBased on a doujin by Yoshitoshi ABe, Haibane Renmei features similar character designs and backgrounds like Lain and Texhnolyze.\nThe overall style is quite unique, both characters and environment use an almost outline-less  technique which generates a kind of blurry effect.\nIt‘s not particularly detailed or smooth/clear, it rather is muddy like a wet brush-painting.\nThe color pallet reflects this effect. Everything has a very „nature“ feel to it. Many browns and dark/olive greens.\nIt‘s not dark or spooky like Lain and Texhnolyze rather has this old fairytale look to it. Like an old Painting.\nNoticeable are some paintings Reki is painting in the show, they look as if ABe personally painted them for the show, at least it looks very similar to his style.\nEven though the show is based on Yoshitoshi ABes work, I have yet to come across a show that does justice to his great talent, I think only a high budget movie could ever embody his style and fantastic character designs fully.\nThe animation quality itself isn‘t outstanding, but also not horrible. Keep in mind this show came out over a decade ago. But overall I cannot praise its animation quality. It‘s just not impressive by any means.\nThough I give credit for the unique style it has, it‘s not something you see often in anime, especially with the color pallet.\nMaybe I‘m spoiled by modern anime and I can never ever again appreciate things that were made before 2008 or didn‘t have a huge budget like Ghost in the Shell or some great anime movies. But it is hard for people from this generation to like things that came out when we were children. Since I also have no idea what the standard was when Haibane Renmei came out I can‘t fully judge the shows animation.\nSound\nThe voiceactors are good, nothing outstanding but give all the characters their individuality. It fits the natural approach to social interactions and isn‘t too forced on emotions like you usually have (epic outcries, dramatic weeping etc).\nThe opening comes alongside with the overall OST, calm folk/classical music, a lot of violins, pianos and other classical instruments.\nI personally enjoyed the soundtrack greatly, but have yet to download it (I certainly will).\nEdit after I got my hands on the OST:\nOh wow I knew it was familiar.\nKow Otani was responsible for the soundtrack to Shadow of the Colossus, which had absolute fantastic music.\nI listened to the soundtrack so many times, he is an absolute genius.\nBesides that he was also responsible for the sountrack to Shakugan no Shana (which also had great soundtrack) and recently Another by PA Works.\n\nIt‘s fascinating that all three of the ABe works I watched, though made by different studios, all offer high quality in their soundtrack. It‘s from the standpoint of presentation the best part.\nRanging from happy, folky, village BGM to dramatic, sad, classical violin/piano duets.\nI probably could talk without end on how good the OST is, but I couldn‘t listen to it in its fullness yet so I might edit this part later on to be more detailed.\nOver all Haibane Renmei is very nice sounding and offers a wide range of different songs and sounds. The opening and ending theme is good but not great, though fit the show well.\nValue and Enjoyment\nDone by Studio Radix Haibane Renmei stands out as a work. Besides it only another ABe work (NieA_7) was made by it and a bunch of shows that I deem not mentionable.\nFunny how both Haibane and Lain were made by smaller Studios and only Texhnolyze got the huge Madhouse.\nSo from that perspective it really was an important work for the small Radix which doesn‘t exist anymore.\nI personally didn‘t cherish as much as the other two ABe works, but still it leaves a mark in my memory as an outstanding and unique work.\nBesides from my personal involvement I also think it offers something much greater than what most other shows do.\nThere are a lot of shows that deal with sin, redemption, the afterlife, human relationships and so on.\nBut not many can make it appeal so creative. They are either straight forward and present it in a shallow way, or mix in too much plot or cheeseness.\nSome use needless pandering with either, moe, ecchi/fanservice, or gore and violence.\nOthers are pretentious as heck and cannot really tell you what they want, without relying to much on technobabble or obscure symbolism that no one understands.\nHaibane Renmei solves these problems without the use of any of the stereotypical story telling elements. It offers a great fantasy setting and moral that can be understood by many people. What it means to live, to feel remorse and how in the end we need to find salvation within the people we hurt and not some spacedaddy or ourselves. If you do mistakes, seek those who can forgive you and don‘t dwell in your own melancholy.\nI enjoyed the show, more than I first thought, less than I did my favorites, but in the end more than I will many others to come.\n\nStory 8/10 (very good)\nPremise 2/2 (amazingly creative)\nPacing 1/2 (slow but bearable)\nComplexity 2 (perfect balance)\nPlausibility 1 (many unanswered questions)\nConclusion 2 (satisfying)\nCharacters 9/10 (great)\nPersonality 2/2 (realistic)\nBehavior 2/2 (consistent) \nDevelopment 2/2 (rounded)\nMotivation 2/2 (intelligible)\nLikability 1/2 (everyone will be graved into your heart, but non stands out too much)\nAnimation 7/10 (good)\nArtstyle 3/3 (Fitting, likable, unique)\nQuality 1/2 (aged)\nBackground 1/2 (mushy but memorable)\nCharacter Designs 2/3 (great concept but imperfect execution)\nSound 8/10 (very good)\nVoiceacting 2/3 (Fitting but not outstanding)\nOP/ED 2/3 (only the ED wasn't to my liking)\nOST 4/4 (beautiful classical music)\nValue 9/10 (great)\nRewatchability 2/2 (something I want to show my children)\nSentimental 3/3 (forever in my heart)\nHistorical 3/4 (sadly still underrated)\n\nEnjoyment 9/10\nArt and Animation 1/2 (sadly it‘s too old)\nMusic & Sound 2/2 (listen to it again and again)\nStory & World 2/2  (most beautiful concept)\nCharacters 2/2 (realistic and likable cast)\nValue & Attachment 2/2 (one of the few true gems)\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    Ah, my first review... This anime was recommended to me as a serious anime. I had good expectations for this anime, but I was quite let down. What was a supposedly serious anime turned out to be a slice of life anime.\nSTORY\nThe story, if there really is one, seems to just focus on everyone's daily life, with Rakka trying to find her own place in the town. There's nothing wrong with this. However, there were a lot things left unsolved. For example, we never find out what is behind that giant wall, or why the Toga are the only ones allowed to go out of\n          \n        the wall, or who Rakka was before she became a Haibanel. They never explain it fully, so that's disappointing. Another point is that there is hardly any conflict. Sometimes, we'll see Reki arguing with the Abandoned Factory Haibane. I suppose the main conflict is between Reki and Rakka near the end of the series. Also, the ending wasn't satisfying, as it feels like a beginning to something else.\nART\nThe art style was quite simple.  The scenery was pretty but  plain. Even the characters were drawn plainly. So that's all I'll say on the art.\nSOUND\nThe music was very beautiful. The opening had a European touch to it. The background music was simply beautiful and fit the mood of the show well. The ending, however, sounded really creepy to me, and I'm not saying that because Halloween is 2 weeks away. But yeah, other than the ending, the music in the show was pretty good.\nCHARACTER\nOkay, the characters made the show more than the story did. We see a lot of Haibane, each with different designs and personalities. But they all fell into a stereotype: Hikari the best friend type, Kana the tomboy type, Reki the big sis type, etc.  As nice as it is to see a variety of characters, we see very little development. The only development I saw was with Rakka and Reki. Due to this, I just couldn't get a good attachment to the characters.\nENJOYMENT\nI did enjoy this, but I just couldn't enjoy it fully. The anime was so slow and drawn out with no real conflict, so it was hard to really get into it.\nOVERALL\nHaibane Renmei is a anime that leaves too many things unanswered. Some people are fine with that, and others, like myself, are not. This was one of the slowest animes I've ever watched. You'd think 13 episodes would mean a rushed anime, but nope. It's just a slow anime with no real plot until the last 2 or 3 episodes. This anime isn't for everyone, so you can watch it and see for yourself. And, uh, yeah. That's pretty much it. Have a nice day or night! :)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Hmmm... How to open up a review on Haibane Renmei?\nI thought a lot about it but I just couldn't write anything besides \"Do you wanna see a smoking Angel?\". So, here is an analogy which I think is the best explanation of the show.\nFairy Tales. Yes, those stories your parents or grandparents used to tell you when you were little. Or you would read them up in a book. \"Once upon a time, in a world far far away, there lived...\" that's how they started. We are given an introduction to the world. Then, there would be a hero or heroine and he or she\n          \n        would go on a physical or a spiritual journey in that world. There would be some ups and downs and there would be a happy ending with a lesson and the end. Haibane Renmei is set up kind of like a fairy tale.\nWe are introduced to these mysterious creatures called Haibane. They look just like human beings except that they have a set of small wings and a glowing halo above their heads. The Haibane are born from a cocoon that starts from the size of a dandelion puff. They can be born as a kid or as an adolescent. While in that cocoon, they have a dream and what they experience in that dream determines their name afterwards. Their wings grow within two or three days after they are born and the Halo on their head is given to them by their fellow Haibane. They live in an abandoned building named Old Home on the outskirts of this town named Gile which is inhabited by humans. The town is surrounded by these giant walls. The Haibane or the humans are not allowed to go outside these walls for some reason.  They can only use things that humans do not need. So, they wear used clothes from thrift shops and live in an abandoned building. The Haibane are not allowed to use the human currency i.e., money. Instead, they use the Haibane Notebook of the Haibane Renmei. Haibane Renmei is an organisation that takes care of the Haibane.\nAll Haibane are born with an amnesia. They don't remember who they are, where they are from, or why they are born as a Haibane. The only thing they have is that dream they had in the cocoon. The story follows Rakka, who dreamt of falling from the sky (hence the name), as she goes around spending her new life as a Haibane.\nThe whole concept of the show is very unique, imaginative and interesting. The way the show portrays its world makes it seem very realistic. There is a tremendous amount of effort put into the construction of this world. Like how the Haibane can't talk to the Toga or even little things like they make covers for their wings to keep them from cold in the winter or how Rakka slowly gets used to accepting the wings as a part of her body. The whole story is contained in this isolated world surrounded by giant, impenetrable walls and the anime absolutely refuses to give us any clue as to what lies outside this world. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered and it will bother you. But the main part of the story does not depend on any of those missing pieces. Also, I believe that leaving those questions unanswered makes it more realistic. I mean, we don't know a lot things in our own real world. Just like us humans, the Haibane don't know who they really are or why they exist. Or like how the world the Haibane can observe is limited by those walls in the same way we can't observe anything beyond the observable universe (in principle. I don't want a scientific debate, so lets leave it at that.)\nThe show is paced very well. There is this natural flow that is maintained from the beginning to the end. It never seems too slow or rushed. The story progresses in a swift manner while the characters develop like a blooming flower. The show gets a bit dark sometimes but isn't overloaded with philosophy or goes deep into the psychological realm. Instead, it gives this warm and serene feeling most of the time. So if you are into fast paced action stories, you are not going to like it. It ends on a happy note with the message of acceptance and moving on. Though the meanings depend on ones own interpretation.\nThe animation of the show blends perfectly with the realistic world the story presents. There are no big round shiny eyes or light reflecting off of character's body. The Halos and the wings are not glorified. The character designs are realistic and the expressions are done nicely. Since, the Haibane can only use things that humans do not need, the animation has this old worn out look in its environment. This blends in perfectly with the soundtracks. The soundtracks consist of beautiful, calm music with several violin, piano and harmonica pieces. These pieces are played in moderate volume in the background and aren't distracting. The opening and ending are worth listening to on their own. I loved the music in this show.\nThis was something unique and quite an interesting experience. It is nothing flashy like a firework or puzzling like a rubik's cube. Rather, it is like watching a sunset on an evening; calm and beautiful.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    Sin, redemption, mystery. A foreign town with abstract rules and hidden secrets, where angelic-looking creatures are born unawares, and attempt to come to terms with this world and themselves. This is Haibane Renmei, the 13-episode 2002 anime from the mind of Yoshitoshi ABe, known for his work on Serial Experiments Lain and Texhnolyze.\nHaibane Renmei is certainly a strange beast to discuss. Much is left open to interpretation, and while not quite as bizarre and alienating as Serial Experiments Lain, it’s not a simple show in any respect. The series begins by bringing us straight into the new setting, from the perspective of the newly hatched\n          \n        Haibane, Rakka. She is guided by the other Haibane, with special guidance and care given to her by Reki, the “den-mother” of the Haibane’s house (called “Old Home”).\nThe first and greatest complaint that many and myself have with the series is it’s excruciatingly slow start. While one would think that introducing us to this mysterious world from the perspective of one who is just as ignorant about it as we are would help to convey the setting in an interesting yet understandably expository way, the start of the series is rather uneventful, and sad to say, uninteresting. This is due in part to many elements. None of the character relationships that empower the show later on have been formed yet, the direction of the animation for the start uses quite a few uninspired camera angles and many budget-saving shots of upper bodies talking. Further, perhaps the largest issue lies in our main character’s initially rather submissive reaction to this place. Why should the audience care, if you’re not doing a particularly convincing job of showing that the characters themselves care.\nHowever, the series’ opening isn’t completely devoid of intrigue. Various scenes and character interactions provide buildup and give glimpses of what is to come, such as the chilling presentation of a Haibane growing wings, and the relatively relaxed mood transitions well into some of the darker parts of the series that are yet to be revealed.\nThe real strength of Haibane Renmei lies in the relationship between Rakka and Reki, and how those two characters relate to the rest of the cast. The growth in their friendship is believable, and Reki’s experience with trial, her caring attitude, and her hard emotional shell contrast well with Rakka’s naivete but developing desire to help Reki as she sees her more clearly. They are alike many ways and opposite in others, each comforting the other in their emotional struggle, resulting in an incredibly engrossing dynamic that only continues to get stronger and stronger as the show reaches it’s conclusion and more is revealed and introduced. How they talk with one another, how they express their emotions and read the other’s actions feels intrinsically unique to these characters and this series. It’s a back-and-forth that can’t be forgotten, and is a great factor in the show’s effectiveness.\nIt’s themes of redemption and coming to terms with oneself come towards the forefront as Haibane Renmei continues, however I will leave off touching on it’s more open to interpretation elements for the sake of letting everyone reach their own conclusions, just as the series’ creator and even the Communicator, a character within the show wanted.\nNow for the visual side of things. The character designs of course are brilliant as one would expect of Yoshitoshi ABe, with the unique flair he gives his characters. Each design really suits the person, and the designs are strikingly beautiful and memorable. The animation is handled by a little known studio that was open from 1995 to 2006 called Radix Ace Entertainment. They’ve worked on NieA_7, Divergence Eve, and many similarly small projects.\nLike ABe’s other projects, this was obviously animated on a lower budget, but unlike Lain or Texhnolyze, it’s a lot less clever in hiding it. The animation spikes and drops as much as the audio waves I see when I record.\nOne thing is clear. This company can - or could, I should say - animate. There are quite a few scenes, almost entire episodes even, where it sucks you in with engaging perspectives and fluid, lifelike character movements. Hints of this can even be seen in the first episode, with Rakka’s dream in particular. When they make the brilliant art style come to life, it works incredibly well. The problem lies in that that’s not happening constantly. Especially earlier on, the animation is generally decent, though still somewhat choppy or stilted, with a focus on shots that show less movement. On top of that, there are occasional cuts, sometimes several per episode, that I can only imagine are due to poor time management, low budget, or bad outsourcing because they are downright awful, jarringly so and to the point that you wonder how it could possibly get past the quality check. While it’s may not necessarily make up for these failings, as I said before, when it works it works. The final episode along with those leading up to it show a great spike upwards in the animation quality. While there are still a few hiccups here and there they really do pick up their slack. Even the episodes towards the middle and beginning of the series have moments that show this temporary great animation. When the story is showing a really important moment, you can see that the animators or the overseer valued that and made sure it was done with a higher quality.\nThe one consistent factor throughout is the wonderful background art, which really brings life to Old Home and the many other locations. While the animation is definitely lacking, the overall impression it leaves is positive. Those brilliant scenes, few they may be, leave a much greater impact than the mediocre ones.\nHow about the music? It’s something I feel is often left out when discussing this show, but Haibane Renmei’s OST deserves far more attention. The soundtrack is stunningly beautiful. Each piece is overflowing with emotion and atmosphere. More so than the background art, I find the music is what truly immerses me in this world. “Breath of a Germ” is regal and inquisitive. “Starting of the world” brings out the feeling of adventure and exploration. “Silent Wonderland” is immersed in melancholic ambience. “Shadow of Sorrow” is mysterious and playful, with a deeper sadness emanating from it. “Someday, Lasting, Serenade” is a beautiful duet reminiscent of Bach’s cello suites and sonatas, being misleadingly simple note wise, but filled with strong tone and powerful emotion. I could go and on about how every single song in this OST is brilliant. Not to mention that as icing on the cake for me, this soundtrack has quite a few songs highlighting the Viola - a largely unappreciated instrument, but a very beautiful one that has a rich, warm tone.\nThese many exceptional moments truly come to their highlight in the series’ final episode, which is a pinnacle of direction, writing, everything. The way it conveys the emotion of the scene is overpowering, and the ending to it all will leave you in tears. Though whether those be sad tears, happy tears, or a bit of both, I’ll let you find out.\nIn the end Haibane Renmei has a lot flaws, but it’s rawness, it’s powerful overwhelming emotion far surpasses every potential flaw one could find. Through its outright brilliance in the show’s peaks, it creates a great impact on the viewer, one that won’t quickly be forgotten. Haibane Renmei is a beautiful, euphoric experience that is not merely a show, but a true work of art, a masterpiece.\n(Originally Written October 26th, 2015)\nhttps://writtenandwriting.wordpress.com/"},

Why are they there? Just who are the Haibane\n          \n        Renmei? How do people end up in these cocoons? Unfortunately, questions like that aren't really directly addressed. Everything is inferred, based on key points in the show. Either that, or it's just blatantly stated something along the lines of \"Nobody knows why.\" So many things about where they are, why, and so on are just left unanswered. I'll admit, I do like when things are left to the imagination, but the entirety of the show shouldn't be.\nThe characters aren't terrible. However, I feel like try really try to make irrelevant characters look important, and it takes time away from giving much needed background on the important characters. I will admit a lot of characters are dynamic, and play vital roles in the plot, but they could've been done better.\nThe artwork, frankly, is probably the least visually appealing I've seen. It doesn't look smooth, and the details on things are insignificant. The music falls in t same category as the art, I really wanted to skip the op every episode but I couldn't bring myself to do it solely for moral reasons. The background music wasn't bad though, however, it wasn't the best.\nNow, for the enjoyment level... Even those who love this anime will tell you, IT CAN BE VERY BORING. If I didn't force myself to finish everything I started, I would've dropped it. There is just about zero plot progression until episode ~8, and it feels like a chore to finish. I do understand what they're trying to accomplish with it, I did get the parts that are supposed to be beautiful and moving, but it wasn't saving face for the rest of the show. I didn't hate it, but I'll definitely not rewatch it.\nI'd recommend this to someone who wants to feel like they're watching one of those books they give you in high school that everyone talks about, so you start reading and then spend 2 hours on a chapter because you just give up. I'm sure there's worse anime out there, but there's certainly better. Sorry to everyone who watches this and prides it religiously, but I just can't. \nSorry to kill your day if you love this one, and I'd certainly recommend it to some, but it really isn't for most. Thanks for reading, see ya~\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    One of the problems with something  truly unique and original is that it can often become a victim of its own originality, alienating  a large group of people who just don’t get or who  just don’t care for its ideas. This does not make a show bad but rather an “acquired taste”, and  Haibane Renmei is defiantly of this type. Its slow pace ,and encouragement to think for yourself could put a lot of people off  which is a shame because Haibane Renmei is actually an interesting and thought provoking  anime that feels truly unique in an industry that\n          \n        likes nothing more than to make carbon copies of other successful things to make a quick buck.  \nThe basic premise of Haibane Renmei is the story of a young girl named Rakka, a newly arrived Haibane (basically an angelic-looking being), and  the other characters who are also Haibane and live in the city of Glie a city walled from the rest of the world. The story follow Raka as she tries to get used to being a Haibane and the new world she now inhabits while also trying to understand who or what she is and what it means to be a Haibane ... \nSo what makes an anime about a bunch of girl with wings and halos living together original and worth watching? Well God is in the details my friends and that`s where this show excels, in the details. Clearly a lot of work and passion went to making Haibane Renmei and it really shows because it looks great, sounds great and is surprisingly depth-full, especially the story and characters which where as interesting to watch as they where thought provoking. Now I should mention that Haibane Renmei  is based on a Doujin by Abe Yoshitoshi (serial experiments Lain) so I should give give him credit as he is the original creator, with this having a very similar atmosphere and feel too his other work. Clearly his original ideas where not watered down by the studio as they allowed him to write the screenplay for this anime so it retains the feel  of the original very well. And of course its always good to know the original artist was involved greatly in the making of the adoption. As I said whats really great about this show is the atmosphere that Abe Yoshitoshi creates, its the kind that you can see feel in all his works that really pulls you in with it foreboding and mystery while making you think, it not incredibly deep like say Mushishi is but it still better than the vast majority of anime out there is.\nOn top of all this is the characters which are defiantly this shows strongest element, their played subtly and not too much in your face especially the main characters Rakka and Reki who by the way where extremely  interesting to watch and grow. They where given much time to develop and it never felt rushed, which was a accomplishment seeing as this was only 13 episodes. I also found it interesting how the focus of the show is never entirely on one character and actually cleverly allows for all the characters to shine while allowing for their stories to mix and develop which was a nice touch as some animes tend to only focus on only one character and sometimes overdevelop them ignoring other potential interesting characters. \nThe art for this series was excellent , after all it was based on Abe Yoshitoshi orginal Doujin so difficult to go wrong there. Its stunning in its beauty, with European-style architecture in the city and beautiful green rolling fields which really make you feel the tranquillity and secluded oasis feeling that this anime gives off but never losing that mysterious feeling that so important to this anime. Because of this I really enjoyed this  setting, which is basically a walled off city similar to a small European village ( what! An anime thats not set in Japan, quickly to the Führer bunker!) and separated from the outside world so no-one knows what its like beyond the walls. I thought this was kinda cool because it created a sense of danger and foreboding that all humans get from not knowing what’s goes on so close to where they live. It created a good mystery and left it open for interpretation as to why this city is walled off and what if anything is in the outside world and especially the all important question of what the Haibane really are.       \n\nIf I had one compliant about this show its that there where times when the main character sometimes acts in ways that just didn’t make sense to me. One example is that after being born a Haibane from a cocoon, given a Halo and even grows wings in the middle of the night she  never has any real questions  about anything that’s happening. If that happened to me id be asking questions at a million miles a minute like, “why do we have wings?, can I fly?, does everyone have wings? , can I fly?, what are the halos made off?, can I fly?, am I dead?, “is this heaven?” ,“seriously, can I fly?” but she just accepts all of it like it doesn’t concern her at all. I get  that she has no memories but did she leave her common sense in that cocoon. I don’t know, this is a small complaint that I just thought id mention to balance this review out a bit, because otherwise this is a relativity  flawless series. When you watch it you might see what im talking about here or you might not, it could be that  im just nitpicking here but whatever, moving on.      \nAnyway this problem should not  keep you from watching what is otherwise a great and unique series, the feel of it is great, the characters are great, the art is great. I would recommend this series to anyone looking for something a little different and proof of the heights of originality and greatness that anime can rise to if it really tries and given a a chance.

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    Haibane Renmei was all right. \n\nI honestly feel like I should leave it at that, why complicate things...?\nI guess maybe I felt like Haibane Renmei was trying so very hard not to offend me.. but to be honest I guess it kind of did.. it seemed kind of straightforward in some ways\nCharacters on a journey? Check.\nDestination unknown? Mega check. \nTrials and tribulations? Check. \nBut where is this journey, who are the characters? Where are they going? Well the answer is Rakka and Rekki, the women of the Old Home, a place in some kind of unclearly defined countryside or other surrounded by a wall, with\n          \n        angelic wings sprouting behind them. They do tasks for the local village and their mysterious elder-type figures known as the Tohka. \nSo, translated, that's angelic aspiring super good aspiring angelic people doing tasks in a giant house for their elder-type masters who control every aspect of their lives. \nOk, still not getting it??\nThis is basically just a heavily masked story of majordomo control complex! It doesn't really have anything to do with where these people are going,  it's just intended to affirm the notion that there really isn't anything in the world these angelic female people should care about, and that obedience to the masked elder-type Tohka is of the highest and most extreme importance. \nYep, if you look closely the themes of Haibane Renmei are arch-conservative in nature and hence it can all be really quite boring. I'm not going to spoil the story by hopefully saying it doesn't really go anywhere beyond those points. It's an affirmation of the safe space, but it's told with such incredible force that if you weren't paying attention you might not notice it. \nAs is, I can't say I couldn't stand it because that's not true at all, but I thought it would be more fun based on the things I saw about it. \n"},

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    I'm going to be brutally honest with this review, but I'll start with a few caveats. For one, I watched the whole thing. For two, there was a fair amount about this anime that I really did like and enjoy. And lastly, it did EXACTLY what it set out to do, and did it as well as could be expected. \nI just wish I had known more about this freaking thing when I started watching, because I was bored OUT OF MY MIND all the way until somewhere halfway through all 13 extremely long episodes.\nBecause this is a story about redemption, forgiveness, and sin. Don't\n          \n        be fooled into thinking this is an awesome anime about angels. Nobody has super-powers. Nobody flies. Their wings never get any bigger. The main character can't even run properly.\nAnd don't get me started about the main character. I wanted to kill her. I hated her with a passion that anime rarely evokes from me. She was so pathetic and awful and moronic that I just wanted to reach through the screen and strangle her. The other characters weren't any better, but at least they didn't evoke such levels of disgust and fury from me.\nI really probably wouldn't have had such intensely negative feelings about her (and to a lesser degree the others)  if I had known some of the things I know now about many of the characters' \"pasts\". Suffice it to say that they're as far from perfect as you can get while wearing a halo around your head. These are the people who have really screwed up at life, and are being given a second chance to do right by themselves.\nFor the first half of the anime, this was a very strong and opinionated 2 out of 10 anime. By the end I was feeling it actually worth of the 8 out of 10 that it's rated on this site. I took a modest average of that and came up with 6 *fair* for this anime because of many of the following reasons:\nThe story was excruciatingly slow and boring 99% of the time, the art and animation was inconsistent and out of date, the sound was just a bunch of extremely sad and jarring off-key piano music meant to make you feel sad and tense, the characters were beyond awful (although they finished strong on that note), and ultimately I have no idea how or why I was able to push through to finish this thing considering my enjoyment was on the level of self-harm during the first half.\nSo yea. 6. \nWatch it if it's rainy out and you have half a day to yourself to eat and fuck off and scream at the screen.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    \"To recognize one's own sin is to have no sin\" This was the line said by the character named The Communicator and it's a crucial detail that will make you think in this anime Haibane Renmei. Based on a collection of strip comics by Yoshitoshi Abe (Serial Experiments Lain), this is one of Abe's best works. It's a show that...... well let's just get the review to know more.\nThe story starts out with a girl dreaming about falling from the sky and seeing a crow trying to save her, even though that the crow is too weak to pull the girl up. Later, a cocoon\n          \n        grows very big, it hatched and that's where our main character is born. She wakes up with a bunch of people who they call themselves The Haibane. The Haibane are a very old kind that have halos in their heads and flightless silver gray wings in their backs and each Haibane is named after remembering what their dreams were about. For example; Our main character is named Rakka, which means falling cause she was dreaming about falling from the sky. While the other one is named Reki, which means small stones and so on. The Haibane live in Old Home in the town of Gile, where both humans and Haibanes are forbidden to leave the town for unknown reasons and only the crows may go through the walls since they can fly. Later in the series, Rakka discovers that Reki has a dark past and she must help her to get rid of her sin before it too late to save her.\nThe story in the anime is really fascinating. Like Wolf's Rain. Haibane Renmei gives us a rich world full of mystery and questions for us to answer. Like why can't the Haibane have new clothes instead of old clothes? Why can't they remember who they really were before they became Haibane? Why Rakka has a connection with the crows and can talk to them? Why aren't they allowed to leave the city? Some mysteries in the anime are resolved but not everything is explained mind you. It's possible to solve these mysteries but it won't be a piece of cake (just like what JesuOtaku said about solving the history in Wolf's Rain can be possible), but with that said, it's a powerful story about the human spirit and it also explores the concepts of sin, redemption, trust, happiness and forgiveness. The characters are great but Rakka and Reki are by far the more developed. Rakka is just a scared girl who's uncomfortable in this new world that she now lives in, but by the time at the last episode, she learns to embrace this new life and therefore looking forward on taking care of the new born Haibanes while Reki is an old Haibane who's Sin-Bound, which are Haibanes that cannot remember their dreams and therefore have no \"Day of Flight\", and haunted by her tragic past. But with Rakka, she might have a chance to be free from the Circles of Sin. With that said, it's a fascinating world and it goes at such a slow but calm pace that the show wants you to learn this world and it's culture without rushing things out till the last episode. That's great and more anime series should do that.\nThe animation by Radix (Sakura Wars) is simple yet beautiful to look. The watercolor art is magnificent and the backgrounds are nicely drawn, allowing the atmosphere to be more life-like. Character models are also simplified yet they still look great and the animations in the characters expressions are not too shabby.  The music by Ko Otani...... OMG! My ears are in Heaven. This is truly an underrated soundtrack. The piano set-pieces are gorgeous, the chanting is powerful and both OP and ED themes of the show fits the show's tone perfectly. The dub is made by MVM FIlms and was released by Geneon, but sadly they were out of prints ,since Geneon was closed a long time ago, but Funimation rescued the series and they released it in the \"Anime Classics\" DVD. I really like how the voice actresses and actors give a much calmed voices to the characters and fit so well. Carrie Savage does a good job of providing a confuse but emotional performance as Rakka, while Erika Weinstein makes a good hearted emotion to Reki and in the later episodes, she gives a more somber feel to Reki. The rest of the cast also did an excellent job with their characters and all in all, it's a great dub that doesn't disrespect the dialouge of the Japanese version.\nHaibane Renmei is a show that it's just so memorable that words are weak to describe why I love this series. Despite being only 13 episodes, this anime delivers in just about everything really. From the story to the characters to the mysteries of the show and so on, it's really rare to find a show that defines perfection and this are one of them.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="                          \n    An original take on life after death in an unfamiliar realm, it has girls, it has uniforms, and it has old men under masks, with poles.\nInspired by \"Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World”, Yoshitoshi Abe, with the help of Yasayuki, who grabbed my left leg, dragged me through Serial Experiments Pain, came back in year 2002 with Haibane Renmei.\nAfterlife and Next Worlds in anime and manga is getting more popular. One year earlier, there was “Gate of Grudges” in Skyhigh. Eight years later, Angel Beats! gave us a school filled with NPCs. I can honestly say that Haibane Renmei had the most interesting\n          \n        idea for a limbo I have heard so far.\nStory\nThe story begins with Rakka’s birth into a town surrounded by protective walls. The walls inflict a disease so severe; it could kill those who touch it or those walk near it. Humans coexist with boys and girls with wings called Haibanes, given Halos looking angelic and cute. The Haibanes aren’t pure hearted angels; some of them smoke, some lie and steal, some are stalkers, and the rest hate carrots. They also have “crappy handwriting” (thanks Kana). Only way to escape from these walls is to wait until each Haibane is called upon by a pillar of light, but nobody know where to. This story is a slightly symbolic illustration of sin and salvation.\nRakka behaves pretty much like anyone would if woken up in bed one day, to be told she died once and was reborn into a different world. And in a couple of days, a pair of small wings will tear apart your skin, inducing so much pain, you will faint. Essentially, she accepts every gifts, clothes, food and drink in hope they would help her get by the next winter. Her immediate friends consist of two tomboys (Kana and Kuu), a girl who’s good at baking beagles (Hikari), a female librarian who often sleeps on the job (Nemu), and Reki, the older girl, presented as Rakka’s caretaker. This series cries out for a harem, but thankfully, didn’t become one.\nCharacter Development\nEveryone named above had a tough time making an impact, except for two. Throughout the Rakka’s tour of the town, her interactions with humans, Haibanes, and a mysterious governing body, Rakka questions the world and everyone in it. She has the genuine curiosity of a girl born into an unknown land; impatiently or otherwise, she would ask for answers to the mysteries this series brings to its viewers. Unfortunately, those who would speak know nothing and those who know everything don’t speak, frustrating both Rakka and I. \nThe most interesting character is Reki; she knows the answers to some of these mysteries and moves the story forward. As the series progresses, we get her character revelations at a young age, the things she went through and what caused her to become the Reki that she is.\nWomen\nRakka and Kana were pretty cute, but both look too young to hold hands. However, Reki is for the taking. The series has small hints of romance between two characters, but thumb up to Abe for not polluting it with fanservice.\nAesthetics\nEnvironments are detailed, from the deteriorations in the walls to the crumbles lying on the grounds. The trees, grass, utility poles and power lines are precisely placed, clearly defining their perspectives. Pause anywhere with a good scenery, you’ll get an instant watercolour painting. The clothes’ shadows are very clear and dark, but single toned all over. The rough edges of what the characters are wearing are an eyesore and that is particularly noticeable when everything else was to be admired. For such artistic backgrounds, it is a shame the characters are so undetailed.\nAnimation is bad; movements are stingy and some are neglected altogether.\nIf you listen to the English dub with your eyes closed, at times it sounds like a porno. Otherwise, the VA’s did fine.\nEffects sounds are inconsistent. Weather and echoes are well done but footsteps sometime turnoff without valid reasons. The dubbed version’s toning down might be partially to blame. Soundtracks cover a good range of emotions, from sunny, happy scenes to rainy, depressing ones. The opening song is like a historical European melody without vocals; the ending song does have vocals and is quite beautiful.\n\nThe walls aren’t just made of cemented bricks; they are detailed objects, symbolically referred to by the characters. It is a shame we don’t learn its reasons of existence or originality. I still don’t know how Haibanes become Haibanes or their purpose. In fact, the series hasn’t told me what a Haibane is. However, the lack of explanation came as a relief, for the director didn’t treat me like a 10-year old child by dishing out a pardonable rendition. If it was between that or nothing, leaving my imagination run wild was preferred.\nThe series has a slow pace, but it’s intentional. The cosy and peaceful feeling Haibane Renmei gives off is the series’ strong point. It relaxes the audience and pulls them into its world through mundane arcs and conversations that begins with “Are you awake, yet?” and “How are you, today?” Many episodes ended without moving the story forward. Mid-way through, I had no clue where the show was going, I had my guesses but they turned out wrong. Truth is that the series didn’t go anywhere, everything needed to conclude the story stayed at the starting line all along.\nA large cast for 13 episodes, I can’t help but feel this large cast didn’t give their best to make full use of its fascinating premise. Haibane Renmei doesn’t go deeply philosophical like Serial Experiments Lain did, but its ending was more powerful and memorable. Rumour has it “only two episodes were prepared when the show was ready to be produced with no real plot in mind” (animeworld.com), I am impressed by how the series was able demonstrate, successfully, this challenging theme that is redemption.\nYou might want to check out Kino’s Journey.\n\n(Thanks to Zylixae and Vis4Vanity for recommending this series)"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This is my fourth review and I am still trying to find a proper formula that I'll be able to use whenever I decide to share my thoughts and opinion here. This time, I am going to judge the anime by the main aspects suggested by MAL's rating system.\nBefore we get to the main part of my review, I want to say that Haibane Renmei is surprisingly underrated for no particular reason at all despite being an incredible piece of art. Even I got to see it just because it was officially released on DVDs in my country and I just so happened to come\n          \n        across this series. That's what they call destiny, I believe. Anime these days is entertaining, but most of the time you do not feel any special emotions that make you feel like you are a part of this small imaginary world you see on screen. Haibane Renmei, however, is a very rare and personal experience that feels like home where you're always welcome.\nStory: 10/10.\nThe story is not as simple as it seems to be for a brief moment: it's about a small community with its place and role in the society of a small town surrounded by walls. What are Haibane? Where did they come from? Why are they here? Where do they go? You will keep asking yourself these questions over and over again, coming up with your own answers and theories. You are given very little information about the main characters, their purpose or the reason of their existence. In other words, this is a story you may interpret however you want. I am not exactly a fan of open questions and endings that leave you dumbfounded and confused, but this story does it so well you do not feel like you've been fooled. By the end of the series, you have your own understanding of this world, which is why it's such a personal experience.\nArt: 8/10.\nI wasn't sure about rating this aspect because it's rather subjective. In comparison to new shows and movies, the art style of Haibane Renmei might lack details or vibrant colors, but at the same time it has its charm, not to mention that this anime is not meant to be colorful. I like this anime's soft and calm colors, character designs are simple and not too complicated as too many unnecessary details would ruin the atmosphere of the series and don't even get me started on scenery, it's beautiful.\nSound: 10/10.\nHaibane Renmei has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in my life. Music in this anime touches your soul and maybe it's just me, but it always brings back warm memories of my childhood, memories about happy yet long gone days, a bit bittersweet and nostalgic, somewhat sad but also happy and warm. If music is capable of making a person feel this way, it's good music. It creates a perfect atmosphere for the series.\nCharacter: 9/10.\nThey might seem a bit stereotypical at first. We have our main adorable character, a moe girl with glasses, a tomboy, a lazy one, a big sister figure and a mysterious kind woman from the past everyone loved. But the world of Haibane Renmei is not simple and neither are the characters. Soon, you discover that some of them have a very interesting story to tell, some have their issues and things do not always go as smoothly as they seem in this tranquil world.\nEnjoyment: 10/10.\nIt's a complicated series that requires understanding and attention, but it's not exhausting to watch and it won't give you a headache. In other words, the philosophy and depth in this series are not heavy. You end up genuinely caring for every single character in this story, hoping that, wherever they go, they will be safe and happy.\nOverall, it's one of the best animes I have ever seen and it deserves the highest possible mark in my rating. Goodness, if I could, I'd give it 11 out of 10. I highly recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for something unique and unusual. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    So I want to do a quick review of one of the more unique anime I’ve had the pleasure to engage with- Haibane Renmei.  Yeah I know, “engaged” might sound like a bit of an overstatement for watching an anime… but simply saying I watched it doesn’t really capture my whole experience with the show.  \nBasic Plot Description: Beginning with the “birth” of the protagonist Rakka, this story immediately presents countless questions to be answered.  She wakes from a dream and emerges from a cocoon as a “Haibane”- an angel-like creature with no memory of their past prior to their cocoon emergence.\n          \n         The world she is born into (an early 20th century appearing town made up primarily of humans) is surrounded by enormous walls which only a select few (the enigmatic members of the ‘Toga’) may enter or leave from.  The story largely follows Rakka as she learns more about the world around her, what it means to be Haibane, and how the Toga relate to it all.  The pacing is slow in the style of a slice-of-life, but it had more than enough mysteries to be understood and character drama to keep me engaged.  Beyond the 'physical' mysteries of the world, there is a large dose of introspective 'philosophical' mysteries to decode such as what it means to be sin-bound (\"one who recognizes their own sin, has no sin\") that are equally fascinating.\nCharacters: The main character Rakka struggles to fit in and find her place in this new world.  She is relatable as the “fish out of water” in the story and slowly gains confidence as she adjusts to her new surroundings and the restrictive rules of the world.  Her main mentor is one of the elder Haibane, Reki, who acts as a maternal figure for the younger Haibane.  As we slowly find out though, Reki also has her own share of struggles and uncertainty about the world.  The other secondary Haibane and human townsfolk all have their own distinct personalities and interact in a genuine way which help ground this otherwise very foreign world.  One complaint I have though is how the secondary characters seem to get left by the wayside in the second half of the show in favor of the personal struggles of Rakka and Reki.   \nArt: The character designs are unique and portray the personalities of the characters before they even say a word: from the sly grin of the tomboyish and hyperactive Kana to the “miles away” gaze of the ever sleepy Nemu.  The backgrounds have a slight blur to them and the colors are subtle earth-tones.  When the backgrounds are simple, such as in open fields- this works beautifully.  However with more complicated backgrounds containing hills and buildings everything feels flat, blurred, and sometimes plain ugly.  This anime was originally released in 2002- so I’ll give the benefit of the doubt that this style worked better on standard definition TVs.  (Side note: It reminds me of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword where faraway terrain fades into the background in a similarly blurred style which is supposed to resemble a watercolor style-painting.  I didn’t like the effect there either.) That said, it is certainly a distinct style which works in establishing a mysterious yet enchanting atmosphere to the show.   \nMusic:  All very soft, atmospheric, and generally piano-heavy pieces.  Nothing particularly stood out to me nor did anything feel out of place.  That said, the music did wonders for setting the tone of the show.  The opening (OP) “Free Bird” especially does a great job capturing the “feel” of the town which is a simple place- despite all the fantastical mysteries that exist in the world.  The song is well complimented by short clips of the characters in their daily lives and shots of the town.  The ending (ED) “Blue Flow” feels much more introspective and the only visuals to go with it are of a lone Rakka underwater and feels like an exhalation after the show, especially for the later episodes.  My main complaint is that the show didn’t end with the song called “Free Bird” (Eh, eh… Get it? Like the infamous Lynyrd Skynyrd encore song? Okay sorry, bad joke.)\nOverall Thoughts:\nA slice-of-life tone in a foreign world layered in mystery and philosophical musing.  Come for the mystery and characters- stay for the existential confusion!  Seriously though, this is a show you can really sink your teeth into if you are so inclined but can also be enjoyed as a set of “character pieces” in a compelling world.  My main problems with Haibane Renmei are that sometimes the philosophy of the show overwhelmed the story (and characters) and that some of the background art quality is notably poor.  That said, this is an intriguing, artistically interesting, and thought provoking series which I would recommend to anyone who doesn’t mind a slower paced show."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    I have a tradition to sink a little bit in the premise, themes, setting and plot of the movie I am going to watch as if I was first asking for a draft. I need to know if I can find something that's in tune with my current obsessions and moods. That's priority. I don't watch something that's not in tune with my current mental states and interests. Haibane Renmei, evidently, needed to wait more than 8 years for my attention, but it got it when I was looking for something of its kind. Anime's mood and mine matched, and so I decided to give\n          \n        it a try. And when I give series a try, I am obliged to watch it full. I expected unique atmosphere, high-quality music and subtle symbolism. I wanted emotions over action, with addition of mystery and melancholy.\nI noted that the narrative is very conscious. It doesn't have fillers, but it is built in a specific way as if it was developing along with the characters. One of two main characters, Rakka, is learning about the world along with the viewers, driving the plot. She is innocent and ignorant of the darker side of her reality through the first few episodes and then she is steadily realizing that the world she is in is not really careless utopia but there is a mystery hidden in it and it is closely connected to every Haibane as if there was an obligation to achieve something. You could divide the plot in two parts: one in which Rakka learns about Glie and doesn't realize its hidden drama ( you can explore the world with Rakka and see its daily life not worrying about anything too much ) and another one in which innocence breaks down and each Haibane must face more complicated reality of their existence ( the story gets more serious and resolving ). I found storytelling clever and well-paced. It is evident to me that creators didn't compromize their vision but delivered quite exactly what they wanted, from beginning to end. Nothing feels forced or ''serviced'' to me.\nThere is something realistic about characters. Rakka's emotional reactions, curiosity and doubts are quite the opposite of predictable, flawless, fearless heroes who are cynical and nihilistic in regards to their pains and problems and tend to laugh it off or take revenge, spreading havoc everywhere. Where many productions resort to this type of action, this anime resorts to specific kind of existentialism. Characters must work out what they are, why they are not free and why they intuitively feel there is something wrong or unfinished about their lives. This adds a lot of authenticity to a fictional world of Glie. Watching it from Rakka's perspective is very believable for me, and very human despite halos and wings. I also noticed that there is a lot happening on the faces of characters. Faces are not frozen but do show a lot off, purposefully.\nI cannot agree with those who claim that music in this series is average or nothing special. I was quick to recognize that music was composed by Kow Otani. I know he is very talented for I heard his work in Shadow of Colossus. As a fan of movie and instrumental music, I am always listening to soundtrack if I find it somehow memorable. In case of Haibane Renmei, I identified at least seven songs which I can listen to many times. Here they go: ''Breath of a Germ'', ''Rustle'', ''Ethereal Remains'', ''To The Town'', ''Bitter Cry'', ''Nightmare/Parting/Loss'', ''Irreplaceable Warmth''. Try out these compositions and you shall see that music is very solid at least.\nThe art style is class in itself, because it is not about woo and not about special effects. It is distinct and ''works in background'' to create a unique atmosphere which this anime has. This art style resonated with me very much. It is yet another example that there is a deliberate style chosen for this anime, not that creators lacked imagination and couldn't do something more spectacular. There is a lot of detail as well. If you watch closely the scenes that take place in the town, you can see that nothing is put randomly, but every part of the surrounding is logically fitted and meaningful. I spotted this while watching in slow-motion.\nTo summarize, this anime feels like a work of art because of sensible way in which it presents characters, distinct art style that creates a unique mood, plot which is structured in clever way and subtly conveys universal themes and music which is beautiful and emotional ( a lot of piano and violins ). Because of the manner in which this story is told, you are almost forced to interpret in on your own and think about it afterwards. If not for reasons mentioned earlier, this one feature makes Haibane Renmei a work of art, not just a one more TV production. I highly recommend Haibane Renmei - it was something more than I expected and this ''more'' makes it so special to me. It is outstanding, it is timeless, it is unique, it is symbolic, it is universal."},

I feel like I watched this show at the wrong time and I wasn't able to get too much out of it. The idea is nice and not that pretentious but the show somehow makes me just fall half asleep. It is Ueda Yasuyuki and Yoshitoshi Abe's most chill\n          \n        show but also the most boring. It doesn't put me into clinical depression like Technolyze and also isn't as intuitive as Serial Experiments Lain. Maybe it has more meaning if you look into it and rewatch the show once (thing that i will try like 2 years from now) but the subtleties aren't as engaging as they are in Lain. Overall it is a hit or miss show that you will have to be invested in from episode 2/3, if you didn't find anything interesting about it by then it doesn't get any better. I was really fascinated and kept watching because the amount of nothing important that was happening struck me. It's character building for most episodes but with them just living in this sort of rural town and having an apparently quiet life. Till the middle of the show it feels as if nothing is happening thou. Somehow the representation of a boring normal life comes off as realistic and that is what intrigued me at first besides finding out what the Haibane are. I can't dismiss that this show has great qualities but it also can put you to sleep at times. 7/10\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This show is very interesting if you have the patience and attention span to go through it from beginning to end. warning, if you like Akira (Special Edition) (yuck) Ninja Scroll (yuck) or any of those super action sex filled movies and shows that have someone dieing every two minutes, you might as well skip this show as no one dies, no one gets their arms cut off, and there are no explosions during the entire 13 episode series, which is just fine with me but may turn the more superficial anime fans off.\nthe story is mostly about a young Haibane (pronounced Hi-ba-nA) named Rakka\n          \n        who is a new born Haibane who is trying to figure out her place in the world she lives in. the Haibane are an angelic race with seeming less useless wings and halos that hover over their heads making look like biblical angles, but other than appearances, these creatures have almost nothing in common with the angelic being of the bible; instead they act and look just like normal human beings just with a different set of rules and pasts. Nobody really knows what they are, or where they came from, but each has an uneasy feeling that they don't belong, that they came from somewhere else before becoming Haibane. This sense of unease is what drives Rakka for most of the beginning of the series. She tries very hard to figure out who she was, where she came from, and why she is now a Haibane. Sadly, the answers never come to her, but we are given some rather depressing hints on what she was before.\nSo what is this series about really? What is the plot? Well, that's a little hard to explain. Its not so much what this story is about, it's who it is about. The plot is almost none existent in the first half of the series, and even when it gets more involved it's not really that interesting. No, the plot is not what makes this story good in any way, it's the characters. Each character is very likable and sympathetic. There is no 'bad guy' in this series, and there are no 'heroes' either. Each character here is a person, with a unique personality and view on life. Each has their own quirks, fears, likes and dislikes. Each is as real as a fictional character can be, and I applauded the writers of this show for achieving this. The depression Rakka goes through half way though the series when she looses her friend is very real, as well as Reki's fear and loneness at the end. They are so real that when they went though pain of any kind, no matter how much or how little, I felt my heart break for them. I felt pain when Rakka's wings burst though her back, I felt sad when a character left, I felt lonely when one of the characters was alone, afraid when they were afraid. So in short, this story isn't really about anything in particular, it's about people. The begining of the series is mostly just a set up, but trust me, once Rakka's wings start turning black, it gets very dramatic.\nThe animation reminded me a lot of Full Mettle Alcamist and Serial Experiments Lain - Boxed Set (Signature Series). I've never seen a lot of Alcamist, but the backgrounds are very similar, and there is a striking resemblance between Lain from Serial Experiments Lain, and Rakka from this series. Both look young, alone, innocent. The character designs are a notch above average. They aren't eye candy but they do go above a lot of amines I've seen before, and no two characters look alike which makes remember their names a lot easier. The backgrounds are really the eye candy here. It's simply beautiful. I've always love scenery shots of green meadows, or large forests, or a windmill rotating in a gentle breeze. This show is chuck full of such shots. Once again, if you're looking for large cities and fancy sci fi machines, look elsewhere, this show isn't for you. You'd probably just end up being board.\nHowever, it isn't' perfect. There are some things that really got on my nerves. The first thing is that there aren't any male leads. There aren't any dudes in this series. The biggest male role in this whole series doesn't show up until half way though the series and play a lack luster role at that. He shows up on screen at most ten times in thirteen episodes, and even then most of the time he's there for a whopping 1 to 3 minutes. As much as I love female anime characters, there needs to be a guy playing a main role in there somewhere just to get a little bit of a different perspective. They try to make up for this by making two of the girls tomboys, but I'm sorry, tomboys, although cool, do not count as guys. One of these tomboys, Kuu, only dresses like a boy but acts like any other girl. The other, Kana, I actually mistook for a boy at first because she acted so much like a boy her age would, but sadly she turned out to be a girl after all. All I'm asking for is to have a male lead here, instead of just a bunch of girls. Is that so bad? this series could have very easily tuned into just another chick flick, but managed to stray away from that by refusing to be a romance (thank god for that).\nThe dub may not be the best dub in the world, certainly not up to par with Lain or Kino's Journey - The Idle Adventurer (Vol. 1), but it is passable for the most part. There were times when Rakka's super (and I do mean super) soft voice just annoyed the hell out of me, but most of the time I didn't really notice. The other characters voices were good, especially Kana's, who stole the show with her constant attack on the crows that scavenged though their trash. As for the dialog, the middle part of the series had some really cheesy moments, but only a few, but they were pretty bad. Other than that, it was mostly real and believable.\nThis show isn't about action and it isn't sci fi. It's a character drama. Its really hard to compare it to other anime when the only other hard character drama's I've seen are Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set) and Grave of the Fireflies (Collector's Edition), and this series has none of the horridness situations, nor the anti war themes of those two anime's. If I had to compare it to something, I'd say it has more in common with Miyazaki's Spirited Away than anything else but it's really different at the same time.\nSo, if you are looking for a drama with characters you can love and sympathize with and don't mind a slower pace and lack of action, by all means, pick this baby up and enjoy. but, and I've given you people fare warning, if you are an action junky who needs someone killed or something blowing up every ten minutes just to keep you watching, SKIP THIS SERIES!! I guarantee you, you will not like it. To truly enjoy this series, you have to be able to pay attention to the characters and their emotions because when it comes right down to this, this series is all about them, not you.\nReplay value; high.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    Finding meaning in one's life can lead towards an endless journey of depressing proportions that will allow a person to go through a whole train of emotions.  We as humans strive to be useful in society, in one way or another.  People who are inevitably bound by loneliness may go to the extremes from selling one's body for company to withholding an overabundance of emotions that when held can produce massive amounts of stress.  Today I will be reviewing the anime Haibane Renmei, an anime shrouded in mystery and focuses on sins, friendship, and acceptance not only in society but in one's\n          \n        own heart as well.\nThe Anime Haibane Renmei was produced by studio Radix airing from October 9 2002 to December 18 2002 containing only 13 episodes.  It is a drama, fantasy, slice of life \ndirected by Tomokazu Tokoro who directed Hellsing Ultimate.  \n\nTHE STORY\nThe story of Haibane Renmei focuses on the character Rakka who one day awakens from a Caccoon inside a complex known as Old Home.  There she is introduced to females who possess halos levitating above their heads and small but graceful wings on their back.  The people who hold such attributes are referred to as the Haibane and live alongside the humans which accept one another.  Soon enough, Rakka produces wings from her back in a most unpleasant process and acquires a halo for herself.  Reki, a fellow Haibane\nserves as a guide for Rakka, aiding her in getting situated in the world.  Rakka is then informed she must pursue an occupation in the town of Grie.  As she strides out to observe the world she realizes that there is a gargantuan wall surrounding the circumference of the whole entire town and Old Home.  The only people allowed access outside this massive barricade are a secretive association known as the Toga.  From there we follow Rakka on a journey throughout a world she has no knowledge of, living the life of a Haibane, and ultimately learning how to accept things for what they are.\nThe premise is compelling and adds originality to a genre that is not so original at the same time.  Though not used to the fullest extent, Haibane Renmei's premise managed to absorb me in the world of Haibane Renmei once again reviving creativity in the slice of life genre as a whole.  Though the premise sounds similar to the anime Angel Beats, please do not compare them in the slightest for Haibane Renmei takes a serious approach while Angel beats takes the more comedic direction. \nHaibane Renmei is a show that achieves at incorporating it's slice of life theme with contrasting elements like depression and suicide.  The anime realizes not to place comedy in the wrong place at the wrong time shaping a highly consistent atmosphere that never breaks.  This makes the slice of life element highly mature in that regard. The atmosphere and tone while being one of the top component of the story acts as a double edged sword in the process.  In order to accomplish this atmosphere the anime's pacing in the 1st half of the story is sluggish which could possibly repel people who either despise slice of life, or hate slow buildup but in the latter half the pacing improves and changed my perspective of the anime from somewhat intrigued to highly interested in seeing what the anime has to offer.\nThe anime is all about learning acceptance, confronting one's sins and overcoming issues, and the anime beautifully handles this.  Infact the whole anime can be perceived as an emotional train ride that when strapped down on the roller coaster, you will feel an oncoming force of wind howling with emotional impact especially in the second half when you go higher up the ramp and drop to the pits of hell, feeling immersed in the world, allowing you to truly sense the passion and emotion the story screams.\nThe story never attempts to go outside of it's comfort zone, never being too simple yet on the flip side never trying to be more complex than it wants to be.  The story is straightforward with its themes allowing for a smooth narrative to flow.  The metaphors and symbolism were spot on bringing more depth to the story more than what is observed as face value.  From symbols of rebirth to portraying different flaws in human nature, Haibane Renmei grasps certain items and elements of the world to provide different meaning to.\nHaibane Renmei does a splendid job at delivering thought provoking questions throughout the anime to preserve the viewer's attention.  Most of the questions the viewer has is left for interpretation, which I will admit I am a sucker for.  Stories with ambiguous endings leave a lasting impression on me, it cranks the gears in my brain during and even after the show which is something I appreciate.  However, there were some major questions brought up that never were fully explored.  What really is behind the wall?  Where do the Cocoons come from?  Those questions are never given a concrete answer, and is left for the viewer to decide which is frustrating to those who love getting spoon fed, or intriguing to those who prefer to conjure up theories.  I, once again prefer the latter but it does hurt the story by leaving multiple plot holes that has been yet to be filled up. It's unacceptable that the anime was 13 episodes long, if stretched out longer the anime could have answered more questions.  But I won't lie, I love to look up theories and organize my own thoughts on certain questions brought up.\nThe ending for the show isn't the most conclusive and left a feeling inside me that more could have been explored in this universe.  The questions that burned with a deep \ndesire in me never got answered leaving an empty hole in me somewhere that as stated I appreciate but at the same time irritates me.\nExploring life as a Haibane, and the rules they must abide by was a treat!  The anime illustrates a completely fresh race of people providing the audience intriguing facts about their lifestyle, how they live, their role in society.  It's a whole new type of imaginative people!  Though, the anime did not utilize the different race to the fullest extent because in multiple ways they seem to live identically to how humans live.  The contrast may be a thin line, but there is a clear segregation between the two races.\nHaibane Renmei, though having a satisfying yet conclusive ending, unanswered questions that was intended by the creators but sometimes irritating, and very slow pacing combats it's flaws with a fantastic world, interesting concepts and themes that are explored, and a simplistic original story that is exceedingly mature\n\nTHE CHARACTERS\nThe abundance of the run time of the anime revolves around the two characters Reki and Rakka.  However, Haibane Renmei manages to generate pleasing side characters to accompany our 2 lead roles.  \nRakka who is the main focus of the story is an alluring character.  Brought into this unknown world she manages to absorb information due to here massive amounts of curiosity.  The anime could have easily made her the happy type moeblob characters you tend to see in slice of life but that is not the case here.  Instead, her character is an actual person with hopes and doubts, flaws, and negative emotions that can overcome her while on a journey to find herself her own identity.  Throughout the journey we witness a dynamic change from beginning to end when she actual struggles through realistic human conflicts, and emotions.  Rakka serves a strong lead for the anime, she brought the world to life with her questions and as a character developed over time in a realistic way.\nReki operates as sort of Reki's guardian, aiding her whenever a question arises or whenever going through illnesses.  Underneath all of the kindness though is a battle between emotions that is deeply rooted inside her heart.  This helps for intriguing issues arise, and coping with said issues affects her in ways unimaginable.  Proper back story is given in order to fully realize the harsh timeline of events she surpassed.  The change from the back stories, to the beginning and end of the tale is effective and overall develops as a human not just as a 2D character.  The range of emotions is extravagant in her character creating a believable character with her own mind and is different as an individual.\nSpeaking of different as an individual, the side characters though not as fleshed out as the rest of the cast are pleasing.  We are shown who each individual is, and how they diverge from other characters in terms of ideals, strengths, weaknesses, and their interactions with the world.  Each character in Haibane Renmei all share 1 thing in common, that is the fear of the unknown.  What makes this fact interesting is that what the characters understand is the only thing the audience comprehends which is unique in the sense of different anime which characters know most of the information on the world.  They don't know why they awake in cocoons, they don't know what's behind the walls and so doesn't the audience leaving those subject matters up to theories since by the end of the show the characters are still unaware of the universe they live in.  Through this bond they share, they develop friendships that they will go until the end of the earth to preserve. Kuu is possibly the only character I have a problem with because of the sole fact she was used to progress Rakka's development halfway in the story, but even then as a character she still stood among the band as interesting, though her screen time I felt was minuscule. \nAre the characters memorable?  Yes!  Are they likable? Yes!  And do I care for them?  FUCK Yes!\nThe characters all act as their own individuals with their own motives and diverse personalities.  However, this does not excuse the lack of screen time that the side characters have leaving some of them unimportant which hinders the characters quite a bit.  Thankfully Rakka and Reki are truly fleshed out to generate human like characters with plausible emotions and appealing motivations that allow them to develop on two separate paths.  The anime achieves at not only producing a fantastic environment, but lifelike characters to go along with it, like peanut butter encrusted chicken mhmmmm sounds great right?\n\nTHE ART/ANIMATION\nRight from the get-go Haibane Renmei treats the audience with almost a water color blurred type artwork that complements the tone of the story gorgeously.  The character designs for the Haibane are simple yet inventive adding a sense of uniqueness to the world.  I have to mention how the faces accurately displays the emotions on each individual character in such a way that I have to commend the animators for investing their all in this production.  The artwork focuses moreso on realism which for the time period it was produced in still holds up as being visually stunning.  This enhances the mature level of the anime differentiating it from shows like Lucky Jar and Soul Eater Snot which take the more moe approach  However, some of the cgi windmills threw me off quite a bit, also some of the environments lack detail but that adopts only a small portion of the huge platter of this anime.\nThe cinematography is executed in a delightful way, showcasing many shots that were directed in such beautiful ways at careful angles to spawn impactful moments!  However the animation itself isn't anything too special, infact it's pretty standard.  But it's unquestionably not the worst I have seen, it could have been so much more superior than what we got as the final product.  However, the show  did air over a decade ago, which can be justifiable for it's time but it's still a problem I have to address and remove some points from.\n\nTHE SOUND\nThe voice acting for Haibane Renmei is gratifying, reinforcing the emotions unveiled by each of the characters.  The voices are satisfactory, and fit the characters more than Elmo as a child molester.  Rakka did rub off as being bothersome at some points, but for the remainder of the anime sounded realistic.  The sound effects were adequate, nothing sounded off nor sounded marvelous.  The ost for Haibane Renmei is one of the most magical, ear pleasing soundtracks I have ever had the luxury of listening to.  It blends in so strikingly with the artwork, and manages to balance itself with the art and animation so it doesn't overshadow it.  The pieces are composed intricately and the quality of the music is nothing short of the word spellbinding.  Introducing the anime is an instrumental piece brimming with power, and an ominous outro song sung by what I can only call and angel.  The sound overall, is complete with amazing powerful arrangements and solid voice acting.\n\nOverall Haibane Renmei manages to depict a rich and unique story accompanied by strong developed female characters, and astonishing visuals but I don't recommend this anime for people who prefer an action filled fast paced anime.\nSo let's get to the scoring\nStory: 7.8\nCharacters: 8.5\nArt: 7.9\nSound: 8\nEnjoyment: 8.5\nHaibane Renmei gets a score of an 8.14/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    This anime actually has a special place in my heart. There is something about the setting that makes me want to live in Gile or Old Home; the simple, carefree lifestyle is appealing, particularly with the lack of advanced technology, and any anime that can make me feel like that has done well. The only other anime that has managed to do this would be Gunslinger Girl.\n\nSTORY: Normally, it's a strong turn off when it comes to anime that hasn't had things in the beginning explained. To be honest, it would have been nice to have known about why Haibane are born and where they\n          \n        originally came from. Is this new 'world' some sort of After Life? But amazingly, the way the anime has been constructed, I haven't been bothered about this. It can usually be a hit or miss when it comes to Slice Of Life anime, and this was a hit for me. Probably because of the large insight into the setting of Gile and Old Home. What surprised me again, was how I didn't dislike the anime once the second half of the anime started. It's dramatic, and we do see a dark side of Gile that may answer the viewer's questions. However, the only disappointment was the ending, which did seem a little rushed to me.\nART: Art and animation are so-so, however I didn't think it was too bad for something that was made around the early 21st century. I'm usually attracted to anime with bright colours, but I suppose the dullness used fits well with the story and setting. There is nothing to complain or praise about the character design, with the exception that the designs are made well enough so the characters don't look too deformed on different angles, which I've noticed in other series. The animation seems fairly simple, however I think the animation was well made in parts such as the opening, the moment when Rakka's wings sprout and some scenes in the last episode.\nSOUND: The sound seems fitting and appropriate for the series, and I enjoy both the opening and ending songs. I can't really expand much on the sound, but it was generally good.\nCHARACTERS: In the first half of the series, the 'enlightening' side, each episode focused on one of the main Haibanes living on Old Home, both for Rakka and the view, and what they did for a living. In each of these episodes you could see how Rakka and the other Haibane character interact with each other.\nActually what I found interesting, was how the Haibane and even the humans treated the crows. Some of them complained about how the crows picked at their 'left-overs' and (can't quite remember if this was said) how the crows can only depend on us to survive. Really when you think about it, Haibane are like the crows; taking what ever is not wanted by the humans, and how they probably would not be able to survive themselves without depending on the humans.\n\nOverall, it would have been nice to have given this anime a 7.5 if it wasn't for the restricted scoring system, and it does not quite meet the demands of an 8 score; if the series had been made around this time, I think it would have superb animation and design, and I would have given it an 8. I can't really pinpoint who would enjoy this anime, however, if you enjoyed any of Yoshitoshi Abe's other work (Serial Experiments Lain, Texhnolyze, NieA Under 7), you may enjoy this.\n        "},

This is a slow series, but I think that works here, it feels more like were looking into a period of time in this world rather then some epic moment. \nArt:\n          \n         I really enjoyed this too, it's very hand drawn feel to it, and breathing, everything seems to just feel real, something I often think gets lost in the modern heavy CGI and computer drawn stuff, not that I hate them, but something about the older stuff I like more.\nSound:  The sound I like too, they went into alot of details to just use the sound in effective ways.\nCharacters:    The series has quiet a few, though mostly focuses on the main two and a couple of side ones, it's really about theiir journey especially the main char that is learning about this new world she finds herself in.\n\nEnjoyment and over all:  This was a great series, and I recommend it heavily to anyone that enjoys a slower simpler series then some heavier action orientated ones.\n        "},

It's simply there for the viewer to absorb, and what you'll get out of it is entirely up to how you interpret its themes and how much value you place on those interpretations.\nThere's a lot to like with this series because there's a lot to explore. The sheer amount of detail put into Haibane Renmei's setting alone is impressive, and it's a very specific kind of detail that focuses on the smaller side\n          \n        of things while leaving the bigger concepts to the imagination. Almost every mundane aspect of life for the inhabitants of Grie has a purpose, explanation, and reason for being included in the show. There's a believability to the world that goes a long way in convincing the audience that the titular Haibane could actually exist as they're shown to.\nAll of the series' central characters happen to be Haibane: angel-like beings donning wings and halos who spontaneously arrive in the town of Grie by hatching from cocoons. There are numerous rules set in place that govern what the Haibane can do and how they should behave, and interestingly, they're treated both as secondary citizens and as highly respected individuals depending on the situation; Rakka, the show's main protagonist, tends to have the most difficulty dealing with this. Only having just been born as a Haibane, she isn't exactly comfortable being treated as one yet and goes though a bit of an identity crisis. It's hard for her to figure out how she fits into this somewhat unsettling new world, and it's all pretty relatable.\nBeyond just the setting, there seemingly exists an extensive lore rich with intrigue; I say \"seemingly\" because it's mostly a clever trick on the creators' part. They know exactly how to trickle just enough information to you over the course of the series so that you get the idea but never the answer. The world outside the walls of Grie remains a mystery, and the origin of the Haibane is never truly explained. Because, at the end of the day, the entire setting is just a carefully constructed allegory for what the creators actually wanted to express to the audience: a simple story about redemption and forgiveness.\nAlmost everything in the show's setting is there to serve the main plot, which is a character study involving Rakka and her housemate, Reki. Both of them suffer from similar feelings of regret which is used as a means for them to understand one another. This is the part of the show where symbolism starts to come into play, and there are quite a few visual metaphors used. I kind of wish the creators had a little more faith in the viewers here, as sometimes more is said than needs to be. It's nice to use these kinds of metaphors, but it goes against their purpose when they're talked about at length. However, that's a relatively minor complaint considering their greater value to the narrative.\nI also want to say that I really appreciate how the drama never quite turns into full-blown melodrama even when it looks like it's going to. For the most part the show is pretty restrained, and when characters inevitably tear up it's for understandable reasons. That being said, the emotional impact wasn't always there for me, particularly concerning one event that I don't feel was given enough build up in previous episodes. To be fair, though, that event wound up being the catalyst for some interesting developments, so it worked out in the end.\nNow, as for the visuals of Haibane Renmei, they're unfortunately a mixed bag. On one hand you have the art direction which is undeniably fantastic, and the character designs which are distinct and memorable; together, with the beautiful background art, a nice mixture of nostalgia and surrealism is achieved. Then on the other hand you have the inconsistent animation quality. Most of the time the fluidity is just not there, and although the characters are rarely drawn simply standing still, their motions usually wind up feeling stiff and rigid. Even so, while it doesn't always come out smoothly, the animators do make an honest attempt to always have the characters express themselves realistically with body language and facial expressions, and that I can respect.\nOn average, though, the directing isn't all that interesting either—at least not to the extent that it could have been. Save for a few great instances here and there, the show is directed in a surprisingly straightforward manner. It's filled with some pretty jarring zoom-in shots and flat compositions—indeed, this is an early 2000's series. But, when it really wants to, this show can actually look amazing. I remember episode eight in particular catching my attention, and the climax of the final episode was visually stunning. This show is at its best when the already gorgeous art direction compliments the moments when the director did make the effort to go above and beyond the standard.\nEither way, the unique tone of Haibane Renmei is unmistakable, and the atmosphere it creates is heavy. Its cult classic status shouldn't be in question at all, as it offers plenty enough to reflect on even after it's over. While I think the show really deserved a better presentation and perhaps a more fleshed out cast of characters, what we do have here is a great series that, on occasion, looks as beautiful as its message.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    Haibane Renmei is an interesting one. It's one of those shows in which I could easily see its appeal, yet I did not enjoy it that much. In the following review, I'll attempt to articulate my thoughts on the show.\nOur story starts with a girl, unnamed at this time, falling gracefully through the sky. She seems sleepy, her memories clouded, when a black crow appears and tugs at her feet, attempting to pull her upwards. However, the crow toils in vain, and the girl tells it that she's fine and that it should give up its endeavor. It does, and she continues to fall slowly\n          \n        towards an unknown land....\nIf that seemed confusing to you, don't worry. I thought so too at first. Everything in this show is very symbolic, and if that isn't your cup of tea, then I would not recommend this show for you. However, if you do like symbolism, then keep reading. This show just might be perfect for you.\nOur story continues when a woman with angel wings and a halo named Reki finds a large cocoon in one of the rooms of the place in which she is living. She excitedly gathers some of the other residents of her home, all of whom have similar wings and halos. After some waiting, the egg hatches, and out comes the girl from the first scene. The winged people awaiting her rejoice, and after the girl gains consciousness, she is taken to a place where she can rest. It is explained to her that she is a Haibane, a person who knows nothing of his or her past and has wings and a halo. Shortly thereafter, the girl sprouts her wings and is given a halo, which was made using some sort of device. Finally, the girl is asked what happened during her dream (every Haibane has a dream before being born), and the girl is named Rakka based on the events of her dream (as is for all Haibane).\nMost of the first half of Haibane Renmei is world-building through Rakka’s eyes. Firstly, it is established that all of the Haibane remember nothing of their past lives, only that they each committed some grave sin or sins in that life. Secondly, it is explained to her that all the Haibane live in a relatively small land, enclosed by walls. Within these walls are a few forests, a central town, and two building complexes, each of which house Haibane. Rakka then learns that every Haibane takes up an unpaid job in the central town, which is full of regular, non-Haibane people, and this job permits a Haibane to keep dwelling in his or her home. If you’re wondering who enforces these rules, well that would be the Haibane Renmei (*roll credits*), a mysterious organization that keeps the Haibane in check and are the only people who leave the walls. The only exception to this is when one of Haibane is finally redeemed of his or her sins, a situation in which that Haibane will leave the walls permanently. \nRakka learns more things as the story progresses, and the second half of the show focuses on a dramatic arc following Rakka and another character, Reki, where more things are revealed about the Haibane. \nHowever, I’ve explained enough background, so now I can begin talking about the story as a whole. Like I said before, everything is very symbolic, and all the symbolism is very much based on Christian concepts, mainly the concepts of sin and redemption. Here's the problem, though. All of this symbolism is too vague. It is never explained (through dialogue or any other form of clever exposition) what any of it means. You're just sort of expected to use your imagination to postulate what it could all mean. This central problem reaches out into every other aspect of the show's overall narrative as well, tying in with the technical problems of its story and characters.\nFirstly, the story is incomplete. It’s true that Reki, arguably the show’s actual protagonist, goes through a complete character arc, but that’s it. The setting is never explained. One of the questions I had throughout the entire series was the purpose of the regular people in the town, since if this world is a sort of purgatory for the Haibane, which is what I suspect, why are there regular people? The existence of the Haibane themselves is never explained. Why are they in this purgatory? Because of God? What makes these Haibane so special and different than the non-Haibane people? Some of my questions throughout the show were answered through subtlety and symbolism, which is great storytelling, but others were either barely implied or just flat-out not answered.\nHaving a story about dealing with sin and redemption is cool and refreshing in a sometimes substance-dry medium such as anime, but if the characters are thrown into an unexplained world through unexplained means and can’t even fully remember their sins, then I sort of fail to see the point. \nThis left me with a level of dissatisfaction when the show was over. I’m fine with shows having open-ended endings where the story may not be fully complete or where certain things are left unexplained, perhaps for the viewers to interpret themselves, but Haibane Renmei, in my opinion, goes too far. In fact, all of the show’s characters besides Reki seem quite inconsequential to the plot, and this brings me to my next main criticism of the show. \nSecondly, the characters, besides Reki, are subpar. When I say subpar, I don't mean that they’re bad or even unlikeable. Most of them aren't that cliché and seem like real people with tangible desires. However, they’re subpar compared to Reki, who, as I mentioned before, has a solid character arc and development. Even Rakka, the character with the most screentime, is nothing more than an expository device that is used to reveal elements of the story through her perspective. She does have some significance in Reki’s character arc in the later part of the series, but that’s about it. The side characters are used similarly. They feel like different examples of Haibane and nothing more, having almost no significance towards the plot of the show. They could have been better fleshed out, perhaps by revealing their backstories and past sins, but the show basically reveals nothing about their pasts; after all, it barely reveals anything about the pasts of Rakka and Reki. This is my man problem with the show, and it, along with the story’s excessive open-endedness, somewhat spoiled my enjoyment of the series.\nNow, in terms of the animation, I'd say that it was sufficient most of the time. Occasionally, it would either look quite nice or quite horrid. As far as sound goes, this is honestly my favorite part of the show as a whole. I really had no problems with it, and it added to the serene atmosphere that the show was going for.\nBefore getting to the conclusion, another miscellaneous problem I have is that the show is a quite boring. I’m fine with slow slice-of-life shows and stories where things are revealed slowly, but the fact that I wasn't particularly into the show’s method of exploring its themes just made most scenes pretty boring, especially in the earlier episodes of the series, where there wasn’t really any direction in the plot at all yet. \nSo, with all this in mind, I'll conclude by saying that Haibane Renmei is simply a title that, although it tried to be ambitious, relies too much on the interpretation of the viewer at the end of the day. When thinking about the show for long periods of time without the realization that it was pretty much just being vague for the sake of doing so, mental gymnastics can run rampant in one's mind, creating clever and interesting theories that the show does not deserve. If Haibane Renmei wants to be compelling and \"2deep4me,\" it needs to finish the job.\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    Note. I watched Haibane Renmei as part of a tiny anime watching \"club\" with my real life friends. Someone chooses an anime every month. Everyone watches it and does a review.  May was this. I watched the last 4 episodes (10-13) in one sitting, and found myself getting genuinely angry with how the series was turning out, since I liked episodes 1-9 so much. So, after angrily pacing around my living room stewing about how much the series reminded me of things in my own life, I wrote this.I'm very into stylistic writing for things that are, well, MEANT to be stylistic. I should\n          \n        probably be embarrassed about this. The tone here is meant to be condescending and sound pretentious, but I think overall my feelings are conveyed about this show, despite it being wrapped up in layers of snotty, pretentious style. It's mostly venting. I wonder if anyone else feels this way about this poor show that didn't deserve this.\nHello, class. I'll be your professor this semester. Please open the syllabus to the first page, and let's begin.\nWhere did we come from? Why are we here? What's after this?\nNow that we've opened our syllabuses, let's begin covering some topics for our class. Welcome to Intro to Philosophy 101.\nHaibane Renmei is a raw, dreamlike introspection into the theory of existentialism. The perusal of what makes a person a person. What makes us, well us? How do other people perceive us? Do other people see my values? My morals? My wills?\nWait. I've heard this before.\nHaibane Renmei is a show based more around evoking feelings, memories, thoughts, familiarity. The Romantic. The Gothic. The juxtaposition of realities and thoughts.\nWait. I've heard this before.\nHaibane Renmei asks the question: have you ever said something you knew would cut someone directly to the bone, on purpose? Have you ever felt you weren't good enough for your own (heavily skewed, unrealistic) goals? Have you ever been unable to let things go?\nWait. I've heard this before.\nHaibane Renmei is foundations of philosophy, simmering just beneath the surface. It's dulcet music. It's messy, just like real life.\nYou know, I remember the paper you turned in last semester, Yoshitoshi ABe. Plagiarizing is punishable by expulsion, even if it was your own paper. I remember Serial Experiments Lain, you're not going to fool me.\nHaibane Renmei does very little for me. I've already seen Lain. But that doesn't explain all of why I don't care.\nI have to explain a concept first.\nHave you ever judged someone for not having the knowledge you gained yesterday, today? Have you ever lived through something, done something, gained something, learned something, and looked down upon someone who hasn't lived it, hasn't done it, hasn't gained it, hasn't learned it?\nIt's a pretty shitty thing to do. \nI do it a lot. \nI'd describe myself as a pretty condescending person though.\nHaibane Renmei does very little for me because while the climax of the story is focussed on the only characters who got more than basic (though sensible) archetypes for their personality, it's something I've already done.\nReki's struggle with her own inner turmoil is very fiercely human. Rakka's too.\nPerhaps I am too cynical. It meant very little to me to see my own problems from years past played out on screen. Maybe it's because I have done all of these things. Maybe it's because I still feel hurt at things I have done in the past, things I have said, things I have lost, things I can't piece back together- things would cast me in a terrible light in the eyes of people I care about, people I love, people I set on pedestals, people I've lost, people I want to think about me; or maybe I'd even cast myself in a darker light in my own eyes. \nHaibane Renmei mostly evoked feelings of annoyance.\n\"Yeah, me too, Reki.\" \"Yeah, I've been a dick to people I love too, over something I thought was more important but hindsight is 20/20 what a dumb thing to do.\" \"Maybe I shouldn't strive to live up to other's standards of me that are incorrect and make me uncomfortable.\" \"Maybe I should get a giant magnifying pair of glasses to see past my own fucking nose.\" \nPerhaps I'm too cynical for a show like this. Perhaps I am too wise, too knowledgeable, too vastly smart for a show to throw the largest, most heard, asked, scribbled, questioned, pondered, meditated, thought, unanswered questions in philosophy at me and not have me roll my eyes. I've already lived this. I'm judging you.\nI already graduated from this school of thought. This is why I'm the professor of this course.\nHaibane Renmei is a show that focuses on guilt, friendship, loss, and depression. The characters are well-structured archetypes, but does nothing past their archetypes. They are never fleshed out. Characters are presented only to drive the plot around Rakka and Reki.  They are given beautiful, crisp wings and glowing halos because ABe thought it would look cool. This show is style over substance.\nThe major points at play are steeped in sensibility and grasp at the edges of real feelings, real personality, but it says nothing about it. Philosophy is only theory, but reality is really here, and really real. Life is messy and raw, but this feels like a 1st draft, not something that should be the final product. It does nothing new with its meditation on philosophy, or existentialism, or thoughts about perception of oneself. This show is heavy-handed with what themes it does convey (what is my perception of myself? what is others perceptions of me? what's after this? why am I here?) but not unpleasant. \nThe show is wrapped up in its own pretensions. It is very pretty, but it's not worth holding up to the light.\nMy pretentious review  of a pretentious show will save you 13 episodes.\nBut I'm probably being unfair. I've already done this. If you had shown me this when I was younger, dumber, not as critical and harsh, I would have liked it. This show for me is old hat, and very unfairly so. This is an extremely biased review. I didn't like it because ?????.\nWatch Angel Beats! if you want a more fast-paced, dumbed down, but coherent version of this. Watch Lain if you want something that truly has a hairs breadth of its themes regarding self and identity. "},

It’s such a great show with great moral and even Christian* (rare for anime) themes like how you can’t just wait to expect help and that you need to talk to somebody about such things or that sickness and disability is bad but you can spend your life helping others. As somebody who has (and still do slightly) hid their pain and have multiple disabilities the themes of the show really resonated with me. Yes\n          \n        I’m aware of the interviewer where Yoshitoshi ABe says it’s somewhat religious but not based on one religion but just on how he feels a God is. This is like one of the few anime that I could call one of my favorites and got impressed with. I watched it with the dub for once and it was one of the best dubs I seen despite most of the cast being complete nobodies in the scene. The soundtrack was pretty great for anime in general let alone a weekly series. Now I have even more of a reason to check out the video game Shadow of the Colossus. I haven’t played Ico but the backgrounds at some point made me feel like this is kinda like a Team Ico made anime.\nThis is a bonus credits in the extras on the DVD but I end with linking this End of Eva like song (which wasn’t in the series).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qha8ujj8io0\n        "},

It is simple and the animation falters at times, but it has an earthy feel to it, making the story seem closely rooted to nature. \nSound 9/10\nThe OP & ED are soothing and calming, creating an atmosphere that will make you want to ponder each episode as they end. Otherwise, the sound is quite alright with nothing unique about it.\nCharacter 8/10\nThe character relationships make this story what it is. Rakka and her new companions only have each other and their work and when one person leaves it's like losing a fingernail -oh so painful at first, but eventually that part of you will regenerate.\nEnjoyment 8/10\nThe story is extremely slow moving. It pulls you in with each episode, and only at the end of each do you realize how much more of the mystery you have learned. This is really what makes it interesting. While there are jumps in time in the anime, each moment passes as if in real time. Enjoy moving with the characters as if life is truly passing by.\nOverall 9/10\nThe story is intriguing and mysterious and the characters keep your spirits up. It has humorous and dark moments and is inspiring.Is there something more to creating life? Do you truly appreciate what life has given you?\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Haibane Renmei is different from most anime and tv you will see today. Rather than tryong to make a compelling show through intense drama, action, or anything else of that nature, the show merely creates an incredibly fascinating and interesting world, and takes you through the ins and outs of this world, while you try and figure out the significance of it all.\nHaibane Renmei is about people with an angel like appearance called Haibane. They are born with no memory of the past, in a town surrounded by walls. The show is about this town and the Haibane. Dozens of questions will linger in your\n          \n        mind about why certain things are done in town, as much as the show will make you wonder about the answers to these questions, they sadly don't answer many of them. This can be kind of annoying at times, but it also adds to the show in a lot of ways. I found myself deep in though several times while watching.\nOne weak part of the show is the cast. Despite the fact that several characters are in the spotlight, only a few of them were very interesting or had much development. Also, while the show isn't meant to be full of drama or action, the show can just be amazingly dull at times, with nothing interesting happening. The show picks up near the last 4 episodes, but there's a stretch in the middle where I was pretty damn bored, which takes down the show a bit.\nI guess one of the shows main appeals can also be its downfall at times. The show can be quite relaxing and interesting to watch, but other times they take its relaxing pace a bit too far.\nThe art is unspectacular, but solid. The sound on the other hand is incredibly beautiful and works quite well with the mood of the show.\nOverall, Haibane Renmei may be a bit too slow for many people to tackle, but if you have some patience, it can be a pretty rewarding show to make it through.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    This is my second review, and may be a bit lackluster, especially when I talk about the music.\nThe story follows beings called haibane— beings that hatched from cocoons, were given a halo and grew wings- angels. The Haibane are then given names based on the dreams each of them had within the cocoon. For example, the main character has a dream of falling as a crow tried to pull her back up, so she was named Rokka meaning 'falling'. The Haibane reside in a village surrounded by large walls that make you sick when you touch them. Nobody known when the walls came there, or\n          \n        what is outside of them, that is for the Haibane to find out when their day of flight arrives—when they are permitted to leave the village. \nAll of this may seem like a fairly simple idea, but there is a lot under the surface. There are religious (it is an anime about angels you know) but it never really forces it down your throat, making it very watchable even to those against religion. All of the symbolism in the series can also be easily brushed off and enjoyed regardless. \nHaibane renmei is very tight-lipped about its world. It doesn't like to give you answers. You never do learn what's outside the wall, what the wall itself is, what the Haibane really are, why nobody can leave or enter the village or why the Haibane can't remember anything of their past. However, this isn't exactly a flaw as it's meant to be this way. You're not really supposed to know, and it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. It just adds to the wonder of their little world. \nAnother thing this series has is that (and I won't call it a 'problem'), although beautiful, people looking for action will find it boring. A large part of the series is just the Haibane walking around and talking. The first episode is exciting, with Rokka growing her wings and learning about the world she has been reborn into, and the ending was nothing short of perfect, but the episodes in between may turn some people off.  \nThere are a lot of characters in Haibane renmei, despite the fact that it's only thirteen episodes long. In large part, you don't get to see much of each character and learn just enough about them to make them likable, but not overwhelmingly interesting. The two exceptions to this are Reki and Rokka. Both of them grow and change a lot as the series progresses. Rokka learns of the world she is born into, learns to accept it, and overcomes every obstacle, no matter how difficult it is. Reki, though, is the most interesting character in the show. She is kind to everyone, despite being incredibly lonely and bound by a destiny she was born with and never wanted. \nThe art in Haibane renmei is absolutely gorgeous. It's simple and easy on the eyes. It's bright and colourful for the most part, but never afraid to turn dark when the mood of the show changes. The animation is some of the best in anime in the first two episodes and the last episode, but in between it's a bit mixed. Sometimes it's gorgeous and a feast for the eyes, other times it's quite simple. \nThe music is also spectacular, always fitting the mood of the scene it's in perfectly, and often adding emotion to it. Making you smile as they celebrate the coming of a new year and making you cry when they lose someone that they love. It is one of the most perfect matches of a soundtrack to an anime ever. The opening is very relaxing and fits the show quite well. \nThe acting in Japanese is listenable, but the voices often sound flat or bored. On the other hand, the English voices always fit the characters quite well, despite the fact that most of the English voice actors haven't done much voice acting in anime. The most outstanding role is, without a doubt, Erika Weinstein as Reki. She does a fantastic job, and sounds natural, where she always sounded bored in Japanese.\nOverall, Haibane Renmei is a great, if only slightly slow series with beautiful art, animation, music and themes. It may have narrower appeal to people who prefer action-filled shows, and its characters aren't all as developed as they could have been, but the characters that are developed well are a delight to watch.\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    Haibane Renmei is an anime that speaks little, yet tells a powerful story. I don't mean it literally when it speaks little. In my opinion, Haibane Renmei is similar to life, it's mysterious and unknown but you understand the key parts with little hints here and there. It's a very special anime.\nOkay, the story. This is what I mean by speaking little as it does not directly give you answers. Heck, some of the answers you won't ever get given, similar to the questions 'Is there a God?' or 'Are there any other beings alive other then the ones on this planet?'. Hence why it\n          \n        is so similar to life. The story is the struggles of accepting oneself, of forgiving yourself when you have sinned. It's a small story, yet it is so big. Get the picture? You go through the emotions of the two main characters, Rakka and Reki. You follow Rakka's journey as a newborn Haibane and from there, you watch Reki's story from her POV. It's quite an interesting way to present an anime if you ask me. \nI want to talk a little about how real this is. No, the art does not look realistic, neither do the voices. It's more of the presentation. For example, imagina taking a walk at night (and you're scared of the dark and what's in it of course). You're walking bravely through the night yet inside you await for the worst to happen, a ghost or a burglar to appear. Catch my drift? Well this is how this anime feels like. Some of the scenes you just await for scary things to happen, like it would in a horror anime/movie/book etc. but it never does. Realisations are real as well. Throughout Haibane Renmei, as there are many mysteries, the sudden realisation of something is really a drastic thing. As they are not handed to you, it makes it all the more stronger. It really pulls at your emotions as you just figured out a mystery. Some of it makes you feel sorrow or fear. It's just simply real.\nOnto the more negative points of this anime; art and sound. The art, though nice, just wasn't good enough. Some of the faces looked distorted, the transition between scenes took too long and made things awkward and it was also a bit skippy, as in the animation wasn't too smooth. Some of it might feel odd to the viewer, especially up to present standards in art but it's not something that ruins the anime completely. Just a positive thing to say, actually I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not, but some of the episodes looked like a movie. You know when watching anime movies, the lines are slightly blurred and it's widescreen? Yeah it's that. Anime movies took some adjusting to for me coz it made me feel like I was going blind, it was a nice touch.\nI mentioned sound as well didn't I? Don't get me wrong, I loved the OP. It spoke more than a song with lyrics ever could. I would've watched the OP more often if I didn't marathon it. I also liked the BGM. I love the violin and it really suits the time the anime was set in. Some of the piano added that sad touch that made you wanna cry. It was beautiful really. What really got to me was the ED and the voice acting. I was unable to retrieve a subbed version and found a dubbed version. I honestly do think that VAs should really try to bring out their own voices instead of poorly imitating a high pitched 'cute' voice that sounds terrible in the first place. Listening to some of the characters speak was like scratching nails down a chalkboard to me. I did get used to it in the end, still annoying though. there was also the ED. I couldn't listen to it at all, not even once through. I usually listen to each OP and ED twice, the first time it appears and the last time. Not with this ED. The voice as incredibly nasally and it really added that creepy tone to it. I'm very easily frightened so naturally I couldn't listen to it. Made me think some undead being was crawling into my room. Bah!! Unfortunately I haven't read the lyrics either so the song holds no meaning for me. Props to the producer if a creepy song was what they wanted to achieve though. But to be honest, I think it was more suited for a horror anime. I have yet to see one, but I think Haibane's ED could easily pass for one.\nHaibane Renmei is strongly character driven. As I said before, you follow Rakka as she struggles being a Newborn and you then watch Reki's story from her POV. The two characters present feelings of loneliness, helplessness and despression. Some of their actions seemed to be metaphors for what some people do, but to not spoil anything. I won't say a thing. What they feel is completely real. It's what a lot of people, if not some, feel. It's what makes the story so gigantically big yet so microscopically small. It's big to the individual, just not to the world, just like life. You also have other characters like Nemu, Kana, Kuu and Hikari who are simply likable. You get a bit of background information on them in the first half of the series as well. You also meet other characters that you know and sometimes bump into and get along with. Yes, I am trying to make another point of this being so real but it's true. You have the guy at the second hand clothes store and it's like being a regular at a particular shop. It's really quite cool. You got to see the light things in life and the dark things. I found it amazing.\nSo a few episodes were a bit slow for me. Episodes 3-5 I think. It was nice watching them but they were the getting to know everyone episodes and it's quite important really. I also really loved how realistic this anime was. It was so real it was scary, and I really do mean it. I was crapping myself watching this. Don't expect anything really scary though, I'm just a wuss. There is a gruesome scene or two but you can easily cover the screen if you don't like watching wings break out of someone's back. I also found this anime very touching to me personally. I really enjoyed this anime. Whether everyone else would enjoy it, I'm not sure. It's a story of Rakka's and Reki's inner self and can also be a story of your inner self as well, simply personified. You might not enjoy dwelling on such things and simply look onwards. It's really your view on life that depends on how much you enjoy this. However, it's not that bad being in someone else's shoes if you think of things differently.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    The story in Haibane Renmei starts to develop very (and I mean here VERY) slowly. It seems like each of the first few episodes could be summarised in one sentence. But after some time the patience pays off - the story that initially was hidden starts to reveal itself in a very interesting and beautiful fashion with a culminating point at the very end. Similar situation is present in the case of characters. Initially boring and similar become very interesting and distinct, each with its own story to tell. My personal favourite (and probably of many others) is Reki, who towards the end becomes a\n          \n        new main character of this beautiful anime. Animation and music are both extremely well matched to the story. IMO the soundtrack is one of the best I have listen to in a while. \nMaybe this anime is not for everyone, but if you are looking for something more from anime than just pointless action then this seems to be a perfect choice. Highly recommended!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Rough around the edges but with an absolute heart of gold, this is how I would describe this very particular anime. Very often wrongly criticized for shifting the viewer's point of view onto the existential aspect of the work rather than trivialities such as the setting; what many people consider to be laziness or incompetence, I'd rather call efficiency and modesty instead.\nCutting directly to the interesting part, Haibane Renmei is above all a spiritual journey of self-acknowledgement and self-acceptance. To be more specific, it is about the equilibrium of the human psyche. In a setting where the coexistence of the Ego, Super-Ego and the Id\n          \n        is made physically obvious, preferring tonal and environmental storytelling over action and plot with heavy reliance on woven into the narrative literary devices, backed up by an aesthetically as well as thematically relevant juxtaposition of light and dark while ultimately proposing a cathartic internal resolution; all the elements required for offering a deeply introspective experience are present.\nTo be even more specific, Haibane Renmei is about learning how to put your self-awareness above your self-destructive tendencies, looking into the deepest parts of your psyche and use this newfound epiphany concretely by changing your approach to reality, metaphorically destroying the walls around your soul. The \"changing your approach to reality\" part is where the anime actively steps in by pushing explored altruistic values.\nTo live and exist with the others means to firstly understand ourselves.\nAnd I use the term “understand” because we must not lose ourselves in front of reality. The walls around our consciousness must be kept up (as the walls of Glie). However we do not improve by destroying or ignoring them. We must be able to jump above them whenever is needed. And to do this is the meaning behind understanding ourselves. This is not an answer that wants to be a positive beacon of hope, nor a sea of despair in which the viewer should drown. \nAs much as the equilibrium is represented by grey feathers, also this answer stands right in the middle. You can live and survive in the outside world as soon as you find an equilibrium. You should never allow for the outside world to lead you to your own loss of self-awareness, or worse madness.\nDated production values aside, Haibane Renmei is an absolute classic and shines as one of the prime examples of the anime medium being a generally criminally underrated storytelling medium. Much better than something that must be analyzed, it is something that must be experienced in order to be understood.\n        "},

All of a sudden a crow appears, its claws clutching your dress, it tries to pull you up. It struggles, flapping its dark grey wings, unable to to stop your descent, stopping when it figures out it can’t be your saviour. Still falling, the ground bellow that even seconds before seemed so far away, is now quickly approaching. For the first time you actually grasp the situation you are in. Panic takes over and you wake up. \nThis is all that our main character Rakka can remember as she emerges from a cocoon into a new\n          \n        world, a world where humans and the Haibane coexist. The Haibane, also called the grey feathers are something like flightless angels, having wings and halos above their heads. Immediately she meets a group of Haibane, that tell her she is one of them and offer her that she stays with them in an old complex, called Old Home where they reside. This is how our story starts, with Rakka slowly getting used to her new life, making friends and facing some hardships on the way. \nThe story itself has to be one of the best fantasy stories I have seen. The shear amount of imagination that went into making this is unbelievable. While structured similarly to other slice of life anime, with the most of the anime focused around young women running what looks like an orphanage, taking care of young Haibane, and helping around town, there is a subtle buildup of suspense, coming form the things that are unknown to us, the spectators. This unfortunately brings forth the problem of pacing, as anime moves forward at a glacial pace, at least in the beginning.  One more thing has to be pointed out, the ending is about as perfect as anime endings get. \nTo sum it all up we have very original story with a great ending, that is slightly let down by its slow pace.\nWhile the problems our characters are something unique, unfortunately the characters themselves are not. It’s not that they is anything seriously wrong with them, as they are all well developed, but they just don’t seem on the same level of originality the story is on. \nOur main character as mentioned before is Rakka, a newly hatched Haibane, born into this world without any memory except of the one dream of falling down. At first she is a little lost in this new world, but she soon starts feeling at home, making new friends. She is very likeable and reliable, if a bit shy just like every second anime girl, almost never showing any unsightly characteristics. \nNext up we have Reki, the oldest Haibane in Old Home. She acts very responsible and serves as something like a mother to the younger inhabitants. Underneath all of that there are some much darker secrets that I wont go into not to spoil anything. All in all she has to be the best thought out and the most unique character amongst them. \nThen there we have an extensive support cast of the other Haibane and a few of the townsfolk. Most of them are memorable and well fleshed out, and they all serve as a pice in the story, but they do feel a bit generic at times.\nI have might have been a bit harsh on the characters in the previous paragraphs, but they are still great, but with such great story their flaws stand out much more.\nThe visuals of the anime are good, but they do show their age, and a relatively small budget of the studio. The backgrounds are beautiful for most of the anime, but the character animation leaves a lot to be desired, as the amount of details drops off suddenly when the characters are not directly in the foreground, and the movement does get a bit choppy at times. I have to point out the art that Reki makes in the anime as it is really beautiful. Also if you dislike fan-service this is the anime fotr you as there is none to be found here whatsoever. The soundtrack is nothing to write home about, but it is still adequate throughout the anime. There are some spots where both the sound and the visuals combine to make some seriously moments of pure beauty, but unfortunately they are not nearly enough of them. This is one of the few anime I have watched parts of dubbed, as I hadn’t felt the best and reading subtitles seemed like a drag, and I have to say the dub was surprisingly good, and in no way worse then the Japanese version.\nIn the end this was a remarkable anime, and one of the best I have seen in a while. The score it gets is a high 8, while it has a great story, the pacing and characters hold it back from becoming a true masterpiece. It also lacks a great audio-visual setting that might mitigate the pacing problems. I have to say I fail to understand how this anime is so unpopular, as it is currently situated around the 400th place. This is an anime I am able to wholeheartedly recommend to anyone, except the most action hungry folks out there. \nI hope you enjoyed reading this review, and feel free to check out any one of my other reviews. I also gladly accept any positive or negative feedback, as well as any suggestions on how to improve my upcoming reviews.\n        "},

One of my top 3 Anime series of all time.\nI watched this anime series after first seeing a couple other series with a similar theme (death and afterlife), namely Anohana and Angel Beats. While I enjoyed those, this series was far and away more captivating by every measure -- story telling, pacing, art work, dialog, drama and mystery.\nThe story begins with a girl (later named Rakka) plummeting to earth in a strange land wherein there is one large village and countryside, but all surrounded by impenetrable walls. She lands as a seedling in a place\n          \n        inhabited by angelic-looking creatures known as the Haibane, and grows into a cocoon and soon hatches among them. She is looked after by Reki, a girl who has been among the Haibane for several years. We come to understand that this place is a kind of purgatory for angels, where the dead find themselves when they need time to resolve shame over some sin of their former lives. Rakka, in particular, is having trouble resolving her past, and later we discover that Reki too has even more troubling issues of sin to resolve. The story is complex and moves slowly, but answers to various mysteries are resolved at regular intervals. There are mysterious Shamen known as Renmei, who occasionally appear and guide the young Haibane, correcting them if they go astray during their stay in purgatory. In the end, there is a final resolution coupled with heart-wrenching loss, but not before deep issues around shame and forgiveness are explored with a very thoughtful, drama-filled story line.\nThe dialog is excellent and the storytelling is consistent at all times with the rules of the world.

The story, which doesn't feel the need to explain everything to you, is fascinating.  The first half of the show is magical as you explore the town and learn about the Haibane.  The second half then, which really starts the story hits you like a ton of bricks, tearing at your emotions.  I won't go into what the story is all about, but it is impossible not to think about the events long after you are done with the show.\nIn terms of presentation, the show\n          \n        does not falter.  ABe is definitely one of the greatest anime artists out there, and it shows.  The entire world he has made has a certain feeling about it due to the art.  But never does it become flashy.  Truly a gorgeous show.  But the real joy comes  from the music.  Haibane Renmei can stand up there with one of the greatest soundtracks ever made.  And I do not say this lightly.

Now I understand that it's a balance of life so rarely properly portrayed, that Haibane Renmei on that level could easily be called a masterpiece. \nThe story is easily one of my favorite ones. \nA perpetual question, need, and curiosity. What is beyond the walls, how do haibanes come to existence, who were they before and who are they now that they can chose their\n          \n        own storyline? What happens after they've lived their intended life as haibane? If you remove the haibane part you can very easily see that the questions are the staples of philosophy in our own world. Questions which are constantly answered but to which there is no right answer. It is us who chose the proper answer for our own life. \n As such, humanity in this anime is given the mask of haibanes to hide behind so it can freely talk and reveal itself even in doing no such thing. \nThe plot handles these questions very well through action rather than in words. The portrayal of depression, jealousy and bitterness for life, and how it affects our characters is especially wonderful. This anime, being psychologically heavy, left you wanting more. \nThe art is okay, it's not overpowering and it shouldn't be accentuated anyways considering the heavy lifting is left to the story and inner (and outer) conflict. Sound is similar in that aspect. \nThe characters are, like in all good animes, developed nicely though because of the plot there can't be any heavy backstory. However, we can see in our two main characters that even without backstory (thought, in a way it is present) humanity, the fears and aspirations can easily be figured out. \nIt's hard to describe this anime without watching it. It's lyrical in that way. Because it deals heavily with psychology and emotions, fear and content being two prominent things, to convey the feeling and heaviness is difficult. It's definitely a must-watch anime for those who like to delve deeper into humanity, and what it means to exist. In contrast, it's easily balanced by the slice-of-life feeling that it gets when it's not emotionally heavy, and so for anyone who likes to watch anime that isn't action filled, it's definitely a good choice. It's perhaps one of the most unique things that exist out in the anime community. It has a different feeling than anything else I ever watched. \n"},

A new Haibane has been\n          \n        born, but she like many of the Haibane in The show have no recollection of their past life other than a dream Which soon becomes her name Rakka, and she is our main protagonist of the story. The first half of the story is mostly about getting to know the characters as well as the setting since beyond the commune is a town populated by normal people who the Haibane interact with, the Toga who are the only people allowed to enter and exit the walled town, and the Haibane Renmei who oversee the Haibane. While most of this time is placed on world building, and establishing characters and their relationships, it’s also used to build up the suspense and mystery of the show. The second part of the shows is more focused on the characters and their internal conflicts. It’s places more emphasis on matters such as guilt, friendship, self-worth, and forgiving oneself. Many things about the show are revealed which is mostly about the characters, while many other things are mostly hinted at and never given a definite answer which honestly was the best thing to do since most of it wasn’t the point of the show. The pacing for the show is rather slow, but because it is slow it allows for the atmosphere of the show to sink in which makes the anime to flow perfectly. \nIn terms of characters, all the characters are given enough depth for their respective roles. Over the course of the show many more haibane and even some regular people are introduced, and are given enough focus on who they are.  Of course since all the haibane have no recollection of their past self they don’t have much of a backstory, but none the less it’s still there and is very influential for the characters.the characters themselves aren’t really that over the top, and come down to be more down-to-earth which makes them believable and their interaction genuine. The two titular characters in the show are Rakka and Reki who are the ones that have the most focus during the second half of the show as well as the ones who go through a character arc which leads to character development, as well as the main focal point in order to explore the themes of the show. While not all the characters in the show are looked into, what they were able to achieve was just as good.\n  The production for this show is also good when it comes to the art, animation, and the sound. The art itself is very soft to look at which gives the show a calm and warm feeling to it. The character designs don’t have much when it comes to standing out, but they all still look very good as they were made with much dedication. The background art for the town and the rest of the setting look like something that came from a fairytale with the way many of the buildings look. All of this gives the show its great atmosphere which is best described as melancholy. Animation wise, it’s good to say the least. There’s not a lot of movement when it comes to the show but when it needs something to stand out, it does so. However for other times the animation may look a bit off and jankey, but these are few and far between since the anime is usually kept at a slow pace. The voice acting for the show wa good as well, not much really stood out but nothing really bothered me. The music for the show however really does stand out, and is really good. It’s really easy to tell from the first minute of the anime when it allows for the music to play by itself as part of the story, and not some afterthought. A Lot of the soundtrack mostly consists of piano and string like violins. The soundtrack works with the slow pacing and atmosphere of the show really well. However that’s not to say that all of them are great since there are some that are just ok, yet still work will for the anime\nOverall this was a really good anime worth watching. It really pulls you in the the the show through atmosphere alone, and is able to keep you there with its characters and story. Could they have done more to improve the show? Yes, but what they were able to pull off is more than enough for what the show needed to do\n        "},

At first lonely but optimistic, then bursting with emotion. The rest of the music, voiced or vocals, often seem haunting with a sense of either joy or despair lurking just outside our perception. The only bad thing I have to say about the soundtrack is that it was split into four volumes from its different composers and artists. This combined with limited exposure here in the US makes it hard to find and expensive to import.\nThe two remaining things that truly make this series shine are the characters and the story. Hand in hand these two aspects carve a place in your heart. The characters are incredibly memorable, friendships, dependence, jealously, betrayal, and forgiveness are critical elements and each takes its turn battering down your resolve to not let a tear slip. \nSome people criticize the story for not explaining everything. Rather than a  fault I see this as a strength. Rarely do we know all the ins and outs of our surroundings, but the pieces we do know make it what it is. This is what the Haibane see in their world and what is means to them. They do not know all the answers, but they make the best of each day of their existence. Regardless of what few answers and the mounting questions.\nI perceive The town of Glie as a cage, but cages can serve more than as a prison. They can serve as a protected place where something cannot get to you in the same way they prevent you from leaving. At least until you are ready to leave and the door is opened. Take it in stride and the pieces fall into place.\n        "},

Many questions will rise within these first few sittings, but as the show advances, you might begin to feel a bit unsatisfied with what it chooses to present to you. For about half of its length, the show pushes on the mysteries of its setting and how it affects the people who live there. However, the focus soon shifts and much of the time you spent pondering questions, it seemed to have fed you, will\n          \n        get left in the dark.\nWhile the past focus does end up affecting the new focus, the show still spends a great deal of time making the viewer interested in the past focus' subject matter and question what the mysteries are. If there was more moderation with the time spent in each direction, there would've certainty been a more satisfying conclusion.\nWhat the show does do good is its characters and their interactions, all with an effective soundtrack. However even with that in mind, the show is mostly fueled by the moments at the beginning and towards unraveling its interesting Christian-like topics. This makes it more enjoyable, but the slow pacing mixed with the lack of explanations makes the uniqueness feel like a gimmick at times. It ends up falling flat in those unique traits with no clever realization to justify anything.\nHaibane Renmei is a good anime, but I would describe it as a somewhat basic drama with a hollow twist, cast by well-rounded characters.\n        "},

What are the Haibane exactly? that is something which is never really fully covered even in the show, and that isn't a fault, rather it adds to the mystery of the anime and encourages you to think for yourself. The closest description however would be an angel, they eventually grow wings and are given a golden\n          \n        halo, which the main character soon finds out.\nThe main characters name would be Rakka, the series shows Rakka trying to blend in with those around her, and illustrates her journey as she comes to know the town in which she lives in, the Haibane are forbidden from leaving, are forced to wear second hand clothes, and live in a run-down building, and while this appears to be discrimination its quite the opposite.\nWithout giving spoilers, the anime has some quite dark and serious themes, which are addressed by the end, the plot is extremely creative and intelligent, and because of that it might be hard for some people to truly appreciate it, this is an anime that you need to look at differently, and when you do that it really is rewarding.\nAnimation - 7/10\nI can't really fault the animation nor can I really praise it, it does the job and while it might seem a little dated it doesn't hinder the experience, personally I like the animation very much, however I can't justify giving it anything higher than 7/10\nCharacters - 10/10\nThe characters in this show are extremely interesting and unique, I can definetely say I'll never forget them, however this series really shines with the relationship between the two main characters, Rakka and Rekki, the character development between these two is outstanding, all of their interactions throughout the series leads up to the final episodes, which is one of the most moving pieces of drama I have ever seen.\nSound/Music - 10/10\nI'm going to go as far as to say Haibane Renmei has my favourite OST of all time, the opening is beautiful and reflects the show perfectly, while the ending is unique and really grows on you. Aside from that the BGM is really well done and compliments the scenes wonderfully, the voice acting is also worthy to note, and happens to be very impressive.\nOverall - 10/10\nYes, I've given it 10/10, everything about this series is perfect, the only thing I couldn't give 10/10 was the animation, this is however an anime which is difficult to jump straight into, initially the plot progression is slow, fans of action and fast paced anime might feel a bit impatient, but once you start this anime you should make an effort to watch all of it, because the ending could very well change your whole opinion. Once you look under the surface you'll find this anime is extremely well put together, the symbolism is seamless and all comes together, while some people complain of the fact not all questions are answered by the end, I feel these were purposeful omissions, it's an anime that allows you to come up with your own conclusions, and it's not just a cheap way of getting out of explaining things, a simple explanation would in-fact cheapen the show. \nAs I said, the plot is initially slow, but the ending is more than worth it, it's extremely thought provoking and you'll definitely remember this as a unique and unforgettable anime."},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    Haibane Renmei is one of those anime that could have been really excellent and one of a kind, but takes just a little too long to get off the ground.  Production values are solid, but nothing extraordinary.  A matte pallet and purposefully run-down art design give the village in which the story takes place a kind of post apocalyptic feel, which works well with the mysterious undertones in the narrative.  Sound is solid, but not particularly memorable.\nBy all rights and reasoning the intriguing premise of the story, solid production values, and likeable characters should make this anime rank as an 8 or\n          \n        a 9.  Unfortunately, the suspense in Haibane Renmei is late to the party.  There is a ton of mystery just sitting everywhere in plain sight, mixed in with what should be intriguing symbolism from the first minute on.  But none of it gets properly developed until more than half way through the 13 episodes.  Instead, the first half of the series just has the camera follow bland characters (only a couple characters in the series get developed in a meaningful way, and not till later) around the village during their extremely bland days.  A couple of times in each episode something actually happens or a mystery is touched on, but there is a definite feeling that there is 5 minutes of show and 15 minutes of filler.  \nFortunately, Haibane Renmei doesn't totally waste its potential.  Around episode six there is a real personality injection into the story, and a handful of truly suspenseful moments over the rest of the series leads into a well done and suspenseful ending.  Its enough to redeem what starts out feeling like an abysmal failure.\nIn the end, Haibane Renmei is probably worth a watch, especially if you like a very slowly paced series peppered with moderately thought provoking content.  But there will almost certainly be a moment of frustration once it becomes clear just how good it almost was.  Too many \"mysterious\" events and symbols that just sit unused and underdeveloped.  Too many characters sit mostly idle in spite of receiving a fair bit of screen time.  And a shameful waste of a rich atmosphere while the camera lingers in bakeries and thrift stores.  If this is your preferred genre then rent the series, put a cup of coffee on to help with the first 5-6 episodes, and enjoy an adequate payoff at the end of your anime day.\n        "},

Which perspectives and we witness an older lady discovering a massive cocoon thing taking up an entire room. This is your jumping off point into the world of the Haibane, boys and girls who have wings popping out of their backs and halos over their heads. From this point on I hope you pay attention, because there’s a lot of subtle details to take in before the show ends.\nIf there’s one undoubtable thing I like about this show, it would be its ability to slowing stack layers of anxiety upon your mind, and all the questions of what the fuck is going on that comes with it. Some of these question are answered within the episode they arise, others take the entire bloody show to be answered, some don't get answered at all, but it’s the theorising you commit on your own that makes that waiting for those answer all the more fun.\nThe Characters (6/10): The characters of the show are likeable enough but there are some that are rather underdeveloped, one of the characters that’s introduced at the very beginning of the show I felt didn’t really get much development before *spoiler* happened. There are other characters in the latter half that aren’t even named that I can’t help but feel the need to ask the question, “Are you guys really necessary?” Even some of the core cast of characters I felt should’ve been more developed than they ended up being.\nReki: The older lady I mentioned from the first paragraph, and the real mother figure throughout the show.\nRakka: The young girl/main character of the entire show and the more or less vessel most of your information will come through.\nWhile the two characters above really dominate the show’s runtime, that’s the exact problem I have with them, there’s other core characters we could be seeing this world through that we ultimately only glimpse. That being said I wasn’t entirely bothered by either of them as the written characters they were.\nThe Art & Sound (5/10) & (8/10): This show aired in 2002 so I expected the art to be dated but not quite as dated as it actually was, maybe that’s just my brain that’s been tuned to expect Production I.G., ufotable, levels of quality from everything. BUT. I will admit that while the actually style of the art wasn’t that appealing (to me), the imagination behind what’s actually shown on scene was more than enough to find some enjoyment in it.\nThe sound of the show was my favourite part, particularly the OST, the background music is excellent and one of the pieces used for the sadder parts of the show will definitely stick in my mind for a while yet. Every other element of the show; the voice acting, sound effects, etc. Was entirely standard for me however.\nWhat do you think of this show?\nI ended up buying it, don’t know if I’ll ever open the box, but I still bought it.\nWould you recommend this show?\nDo you need a show to casually watch when it’s raining or something? Or want something to think about for a while? Then this show has got you covered.\nGopdbye my brethren, see you in the next one.\n        "},

It draws you in, you follow the same progression as Rakka as she is 'born' of her cocoon and finds out about life in the idyllic setting designed for the haibane. Then the loss of a friend and she understands that not all is as it seems and we follow her arc through the series. Getting a job, the well, the confusion and not understanding which is inherent in her surroundings.\nThis show is a rare one in that it\n          \n        is entirely different on a second watching, there are so many little subtle clues about what the haibane are, and what the place itself is.\nSpoilers below\nMy thoughts on the series is that all the haibane are teen suicides who are given a second chance. The towns folks are in heaven (a form of it anyway) and to be members of the town the haibane must do penance in the form of work and wearing only second-hand clothes. My reasoning for this is the librarian who kept mentioned how many days she had left, and that time coincided with the disappearance/flight of Kuu. (this also explains the 'lucky' comments from the woman, Rakka's reaction to her, and then why the townspeople are so protective of them and why they can only work in certain places) I believe their old selves become part of the wall, which is their souls that quite literally guard the town. The haibane cannot touch the wall because their souls are not ready because of unfinished business and/or sin.\nWe were not given any information about the young-feathers other than they choose names on their future, it could be the haibane have to take care of these souls while they wait to be born. Or perhaps these are the souls that would have been had the haibane not killed themselves.\nThe Touga, who cannot speak to the residents or haibane are angels who keep the town alive and safe through trade as the Haibane Renmei stated that it was 'inevitable' that Rakka would be pulled from the well by them and was quite specific about that. \nThe Haibane Renmei himself I believe to be a failed haibane (based on his fake wings) who become priests who learn the language to talk with the angels (touga). The fact that Rakka is brought into the wall and learns this language could mean she is destined for this life.\nYou can spend a lot of time pouring over each episode because of the sheer weight of the symbolism and metaphoric elements used everywhere.\nThis is a must see anime.\n        "},

(Hard to tell, you’ll see why later)\nDisclaimer: To this date, Haibane Renmei is my favorite anime ever. I wanted to start this book off with something special to me, so here you go.\nPlot: 9/10\nThe plot of Haibane Remei is kind of hard to describe. It’s pretty much a slice of life series for the first half of the show, so there’s really no plot to be found. The show opens to a scene of a girl falling through the sky. She is approached by a crow who seems to want something. The crow tries to help\n          \n        the girl from falling, but the girl accepts her fate and then she wakes up. This girl is Rakka. She was born as a Haibane, an angel-like creature with wings and a halo, in the town of Glie. Other Haibane surround her egg and help her get accustomed to her new life in Glie once it hatches. For the first couple episodes, Hakka follows the other Haibane around to their workplaces so she can find out more about the town. She finds out that humans live alongside the Haibane peacefully, but the Haibane aren’t allowed to do certain things. (Like using anything that is new). She also finds out that there’s only one way to leave the town. That way is if you’re a Haibane and you’re magically get called to leave by some “higher being” outside the walls. Rakka ends up spending most of her time with Reki, the Haibane that first discovered Rakka’s egg. She then finds out the meaning of sin-bound, which is a Haibane who’s doomed to never leave the town because they can’t remember their dream in the egg and can’t come to terms with living in Glie. Since Hakka wake up before her dream finished, her wings grow a black tint and she’s marked as sin-bound. (Reki is also sin-bound). The rest of the series is spent trying to figure out who Reki and Hakka are as characters and why some people are sin-bound and others aren’t.\n\nArt/Animation: 8/10\nThis series was made in 2002. People tend to dismiss anime from the 1900’s and early 2000’s because of their outdated art styles and animation. The first anime that comes to mind who’s art style still holds up is Monster. That said, the art and animation for this serious is really good for 2002. The dark and gritty color palette really sets the tone of the bleak atmosphere the series gives off. There’s also a couple of problems with the animation. A series can never be perfect, and Haibane Renmei is not an exception. Here and there you can see some problems with the animation, but overall it is good. The only problem I really had with the art, is that since the colors were so dark, after awhile it can be perceived as boring.\n\nMusic: 10/10\nThe soundtrack was composed by Ko Otani. Not much to say about that. Guy’s amazing. I’ve fallen asleep many times listening to the soundtrack ;P\n\nCharacters: 8.5/10\nA good anime needs good characters and Haibane Renmei has quite the small cast. There are a lot of background characters, but only a few who are named. Most characters in the series are there to serve a purpose. I kind of wish some weren’t there for someone else’s convenience *Cough* Kuu *Cough* Every character does serve a purpose, but the only characters I really remember after watching the series are Reki and Rakka. It’s not a coincidence that they were the best characters by far. Rakka is amazing because she’s the most human out of most people there/ A lot of people in the town give up on trying to escape and settle down, but Rakka routinely questions her own existence and why she and Reki are doomed and not other people. Reki is really the main character of this series even though it’s from Rakka’s point of view. And I can’t say anything else without spoiling it. \nOverall Score: 8.8/10\n"},

A World all your own, a world made in your image that is more beautiful beyond anything else. I have dreamed of a world like this, and it looks a lot like the world in Haibane Renmei. \nThis IS a truly beautiful anime. The art and soundtrack stand alone in greatness compared to other soundtracks and artwork in other anime. Beacuse the creator does such a great job of presenting this world in the show. What I mean is, we get lots of different long wide shots of the village and\n          \n        the world these angels inhabit. The trees, the houses, and the forrests are so beautifly done I just don't know how to explain it without you viewing it for yourselves. \nAll I can say in an end note about this anime, is that its pefect for a rainy day. It has that kind o feel to it. Haibane Renmei is a kind, gentle, and slow moving anime, but its soft in its storytelling, just like the angels. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    The story of Haibane Renmei is full of interesting themes of sin and redemption. However, we don’t really see those themes untill half way through the series, and for good reasons. As we follow Rakka through her new life as a Haibane, she stumbles across some new interesting questions about their culture and the mysterious town they live in. This helps bring in more mystery and curiosity for the viewer as well. And then when the main themes of the series make their appearance, all hell breaks loose. With the thought of sin and redemption, you would think there is some sort of religious thing\n          \n        involved. Not quite. There are many religious themes involved, however, it’s more of an allegory then a strict following of a certain religion.As well as question some of the more interesting plot points of the series such as the wall surrounding the area. I personally loved the series because of it's creativity, and how it differs from a lot of anime. Without cleshay main characters, plus it's beautiful story, I give this series a 10 with no hesitation. I usually don't recommend shows like this to people, but this series is a game changer.\n        "},

Keep in mind, that the setting is absolutely fictional, and the characters are absolutely fictional creatures. Yet, this seemed a lot more \"real\" than many anime set in the real world, with average characters.\n   This realism is most likely what made it boring.\n   This realism is\n          \n        most likely what made it interesting.\n   Definitely not for everyone's taste. \n        "},

The art of this series is fantastic, the characters all have their own distinct personalities, and it has a very solid plot. I only wish there could have been more episodes and more back-story. \n"},
