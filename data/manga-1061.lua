One day, while at an outing with childhood friend Ran Mouri, Shinichi bears witness to a suspicious transaction between two men and is caught. As a result, he is forced to ingest a poison that is supposed to kill him, but unexpectedly shrinks his body to the size of a grade-schooler instead. Now believed to be dead, Shinichi takes up the alias of Conan Edogawa (a compound of the names of the famous mystery authors Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa) in order to hide his identity and begins his new life as a seven-year-old living with Ran and her private detective father. Detective Conan follows Conan as he continues to solve murder cases, all while slowly working toward exposing the men who shrunk him and eventually restoring his body. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=101,  ["text"]="           \n    Seeing as how few reviews of this – undoubtedly very popular and influential – manga there are, I thought that it deserved more attention and decided to write myself one.\nBut before proceeding to the main body of the review I must mention that despite my personal tastes and subjectivity – as you can see I gave this manga the highest possible ranking – I understand that not everyone’s tastes coincide with mine, and I’m aware that some people may not like what I happen to like. That’s why in this review I will try to name all the ‘pro’ and ‘contra’ arguments as to if\n          \n        you should read this manga or not.\n Also I must warn all potential readers that this review may contain MINOR SPOILERS – but I’m sure that everyone who considers a possibility of reading Detective Conan may already know that information, because, I think, before indulging oneself into a long read it is quite natural to look for some information about it on the Internet. Basically, these spoilers are well-known facts, but just in case – be alert.\nAnd last, but not least: this review is going to be a LONG one. If you don’t like big amounts of text, better stop reading now or skip the main part and go to the conclusion right away. But then again, if you think of reading DC, which is one of the most text-heavy mangas out there, that means you are prepared for reading quite a bit of text. So it would be better to read the whole review.\nWell, enough with the introduction. I’m fairly sure that nearly everyone had heard about the initial premise in DC. A high-school student, who also happens to be a genius detective, was turned into a grade-school kid by some mysterious organization, so he tries to uncover its evil deeds and get back to his original form, cracking alongside all the tough cases he encounters – his everyday life seems to be packed with them. Basically, that’s all that there is to it. But let’s dig a little deeper.\nOne can divide the plot in DC into lesser sub-plots – Black Organization plot (considered to be main plot), Conan’s identity plot, multiple love storylines, Kaito Kid cases, cases concerning characters past, the so-called filler cases etc. Mind you, this division is not an ultimate one – sub-plots may differ depending on the story arc; there may be different opinions on the point of what to call a ‘plot’ – are the recurring characters enough or there must be a continuity of events; sub-plots tend to overlap in most of the cases.\nI haven’t done a statistical research as to how many chapters relate to the main plot, but I can surely tell that not many. Usually, BO cases happen once in 100 chapters – Gosho puts them as every new one-hundredth file (so all DC fans are now eagerly anticipating file 800). They provide elements of thriller, suspense and action in the series – in my opinion, they are excellent and really fire up mostly deduction-oriented plot. But that doesn’t mean that there is not enough space for the brain activity – they include intricate planning on both sides(Conan and BO), mind games like ‘I know what you think, but you know that I know, so I won’t do what you think I’ll do and will do that instead’. BO arcs are real gems and are definitely worth checking out.\nDC is also defined as ‘romance’ alongside with a detective – and that is no coincidence. We already have countless pairings in DC – some were added in 700+ chapters, and there are signs of more to come. Nearly every recurring character has a love story, or a love interest – even kids – so it is easy to conclude that DC is not only a detective manga. Personally, I like romance in DC, though a lot of people may find that love lines tend to drag on forever, and thus are not very enjoyable – that may be true, but nevertheless characters’ interaction is still good, and there are signs of speeding the love stories up(but these signs are visible in the 700+ chapters).\nI won’t say much about Conan’s identity plot in order to avoid spoilers – but they are also very good. I love to see how Conan tries to remain incognito and how smart he can be whenever he finds himself in a tough situation.\nLeaving other plots aside, the rest of the manga consists of cases, mostly murder ones. But I won’t call these cases ‘filler’, because they are nearly always intertwined with love stories, characters’ past or they may even give us hints considering the main plot – in my opinion, they are not ‘filler’. Fairly recently, though, there had been an increasing number of cases that have no relation to none of the plots whatsoever, and on top of that they weren’t interesting – maybe Gosho is running out of ideas. Time will tell if that assumption is valid – and I would even lower my ranking if that turns out to be the case, but now I think it’s too early for such a conclusion.\nSpeaking of cases, they are, for the most part, very good. Having been raised on such fine examples of detective literature, such as works of Conan Doyle, Christie(my favourite author), Stout and many others, I thought that the cases in detective manga would be much worse – and I admit that I was wrong in that aspect. Yes, it would be an exaggeration to say that DC reaches the highest level of detective fiction, established by the above-mentioned authors – but in some cases it comes close to that.\nThere are also certain types of cases that follow the usual pattern – three files on a single case (murder – investigation – solution), three suspects etc., but it’s only an outside similarity, every case is different. True, some ideas are used several times – for example, many cases feature technical devices and gimmicks to commit a crime(Gosho’s brother helps him to come up with sometimes elaborate ways of killing people); ‘dying messages’ are also frequently encountered, there is quite a number of ‘locked rooms’, but I can name only two or three examples of exact repetitiveness – a very small number if you think about the whole number of cases(and even in that situations, it was not enough to deduce the whole truth – mysteries also remained). So, in my opinion, DC is not repetitive – it only follows usual standards and patterns set up by the author, who also breaks them once in a while.\nI’ve already mentioned detective classics – if I were to compare DC to them, then surely it resembles Holmes’ stories the most – short, yet difficult, thought-provoking(even mind-boggling), original. Holmes is also often mentioned throughout the story – clearly he was the inspiration for the main character. Poirot’s influence is much lesser, but it is clearly felt in ‘isolated mansion’-type cases, and sometimes Poirot is mentioned directly (even the café the characters frequently visit is called ‘Poaro’). Other famous investigators mentioned in some way or another are Jules Maigret, Ellery Queen, Cordelia Gray, Victoria Warshawski, Kogorou Akechi etc., but as far as I can tell they are not much of an influence(except for Akechi, who’s clearly is a very important character, but I’m not very familiar with Japanese detective fiction). Another fact that proves Gosho is familiar with the classics of detective fiction is that he sometimes uses murder or alibi tricks described in famous detective novels in his own cases   – but rather than accusing Gosho of the lack of creativity, it can be considered as a fanservice to hardcore detective fans.\nWhat makes DC even more enjoyable apart from the mysteries is a wonderful cast of characters. Here you will find a variety of brilliant sleuths, dumb (though still loveable) police officers, ingenious (but not ingenious enough) culprits – everything you’d expect to find in a detective fiction. But that’s not all – comic interaction between characters provides consistent laughs throughout the manga. Memorable characters are a necessary component for a long-running series – when you get tired of complex murder plots, you still may want to continue reading because you have grown a strong bond to some characters – and that’s exactly the case with DC.  It is one of the strongest points of the manga – many people would find it interesting not because of the cases, but because of the characters in it.\nThroughout the seventeen years of its run, the artistic style of Gosho has changed (though it’s not as visible as in Magic Kaito) – from a more comic, light-hearted one (as in Yaiba) to a more serious one. Aoyama is a wonderful artist, and I love the way that he draws – even with attention to the utmost detail of surroundings, which can become one of the clues later on(so pay attention to the surroundings, it may help you uncover the truth before Conan). Character design is also very good – I’m talking about the main ones (minor characters, which differ from case to case, are often drawn similarly, but I don’t consider it a shortcoming) – it makes the characters even more loveable. But I must say that the drawing style is quite different from what you will find in other mangas, so it may take you some time to get accustomed to it. After a while, I think you will get used to it.\nHaving finished the general overview, I also feel obliged to say about some aspects of DC that will make this review more thorough – I think that these points would help to determine if this manga is for you or not.\nThe first of these points will be the one addressed to anime-centric fans. Despite this review being the one based on the manga, I can’t omit the manga-anime comparison. ‘There’s an anime more than 600 episodes long, why should I read the manga then?’ – You may ask. Here is my advice: if you decide to dive into DC, start with the manga. Yes, the anime is well-made, follows the manga closely, features a superb seiyuu cast, but manga is better. The reason for this is the beginning – major anime changes led TMS into trouble, though later problems were resolved, but not very smoothly. Since then, luckily animators haven’t improvised, but to have a full grasp of events I suggest you read the manga first, and always keep this schedule – to be ahead in manga in terms of plot development. After all, it’s the original.\nOne more thing – if you want to read this manga, then it would be better to obtain a licensed version (Viz Media currently has it covered up to volume 41, I guess), and then read the scanlation. Why? Because it’s legal and because the quality of many scans from around volume 20 to volume 40 is horrible – bad image quality, often from Chinese or Vietnamese sources, poor translation with spelling and grammar errors, which make some cases very difficult to understand. So, be warned: if you decide to go on a long detective journey, your happiness may be overshadowed by poor scans – so choose the legal version.\nAnother point of concern is possibly the detective nature of the manga. In short, it is nothing but cases. For a detective fiction lover, it is close to heaven. For someone, who has no thing for a crime literature, the whole thing may be boring and tedious. ‘One case after another – what’s the point of this?’ – I can hear such a question. If you don’t see the point of solving cases with powers of deduction and logic, then I’m afraid I can’t help you. Then I suggest you to avoid DC.\nThere’s yet one more warning I must issue – having run for 17 years, DC, as every long-running manga, features a very slow plot development. What’s more – it doesn’t seem to end in the near future. Gosho said that he won’t overcome ‘Kochikame!’ by a number of volumes, so all we can say is that there will be no more than 170 volumes (right now 74 volumes of DC were published). Judging by the fact that there are multiple conflicts to resolve, that new characters are introduced in 700+ chapters, and DC is still among the best-selling manga in Japan, I can say that it will run for 5-10 years at least, and it will be no surprise for me if Gosho isn’t even halfway through the manga. So, if you don’t like to wait in anticipation every week or two for a new file to come out(and for a very long time also), better don’t start reading it now – it would be better to read 1500+chapters 15 years later when the manga is finished(I hope).\nSo, to sum it all up, if you’re not a detective fan, do not like slow plot development and are strongly opposed to long-running series with no end in the near future – DC is not a manga I would suggest you to read.\nIf, on the other hand, you like classic crime fiction and don’t mind a lengthy, but otherwise worthy read – I strongly recommend Detective Conan to you as one of the best(if not the best) examples of the detective manga. Moreover, other examples of detective genre in manga like Kindaichi or Tantei Gakuen Q are very hard to obtain and require other-than-English language knowledge, while DC certainly beats Zodiac P.I., Remote and other detective mangas. And if you choose DC for its cases, as an option, you would receive great and suspenseful overarching plot, touching romantic storylines, excellent comic moments and a memorable cast of characters. Clearly, DC is more than just detective manga – that’s what makes it really special.\nFor all of you detective fiction lovers out there, there is only one truth – read Detective Conan now!"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=46,   ["text"]="          \n    The first time I read this series was when I happened to pick up a copy at the library.  At first, didn't really think much of it, but eventually it's grown on me.\nStory: most of the cases they present are really entertaining, and often suspenseful.  I find myself anticipating what will happen and I enjoy the suspense; I think that's what pulls you to the story.  However, having read so many chapters now, with almost one case every 2-3 chapters, you start to find some ideas being repetitive.  Overall though, it's still good.\nArt: not much to say for art.  It's\n          \n        a little different to the typical drawings of manga, but that doesn't make it bad.  The more you read, the less you'll mind the drawings.  \nCharacters: repetitive use of characters can be good or bad.  Good thing is you familiarize yourself with them, bad thing is it does at time get boring.  However, I like the cast of conan, it fits with the story pretty well, so, in this case I don't mind repetition :)\nEnjoyment: same as for the story.  At first it's very thrilling but I find it's slightly repetitive now, so it's not as good as when I first read it.  But the cases itself are really cool, you learn a lot of new things.  Sure, not all the things are probably accurate, but they are cool nontheless.\nOverall: I think the only two aspects that kind of pulls it down the score are story and characters.  But overall, it's worth a read if you're into crime solving stories.  There's also slight comic relief in this manga which contrasts nicely to the seriousness of the cases.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=19,   ["text"]="          \n    Right let start at the beginning, this is my first review \"EVER\".\nNow onto the review,\nWhen I got to this manga I expected there to be some stories that I would not enjoy and some stories that I would enjoy.\nThis manga's story regarding the BO is brilliant everything surrounding them is well planned and executed however the other stories regarding investigations after a while got so boring that I wanted to quit multiple time over because they were basically the same with different characters which made the reading more of a chore instead of enjoyment.\nStory;\nFor me the actual cannon material that I mentioned above \"The Black\n          \n        Organisation\" is the most amazing stuff you can find anywhere, it grips you and doesn't let go until the end. However the filler arcs are my problem at first I thought like this wow its pretty okay, after 200 or chapters of filler I wanted to k*ll myself but instead of doing so I took a break for a few weeks and continued onwards until the point where I had to take a break again because it was so boring.\nCharacters;\nThroughout the story we meets thousands of different characters however they are mostly minor and almost never reappear again, with them I have no problems whatsoever because I know that there is no need to develop minor characters that will disappear in a few chapters. My main problems are with Ran, Mouri, Kazuha, some police detectives. Starting off with Ran she witnessed hundreds of cases but still believes there are ghosts when people say so = where is the logic in that???, next Mouri over the 924 I have not seen any character development whatsoever which is to say that he was retarder and will continue being retarded, Kazuha with her I don't have much of a problem because she is a minor character that appear rarely but she is basically like Ran but practises a different Martial Art. And Lastlty detectives in this story are even more stupid than or are on the same level as Mouri for example; A kid says something relevant to the case, what do the detective do? scream at them for interfering. Great Huh?\nArt;\nTo be honest I don't have anything about the art it is pretty decent.\nEnjoyment;\nOverall my enjoyment of the series has been killed by the continuous filler arcs which ruin the entire series. The ONLY time I was enjoying myself was when the story revolved around THE BLACK ORGANISATION.\nThanks for reading \"if you finished anyway\""},

What first grabed my attention in this book was the way the crimes were pulled off and I stayed hooked. \nAfter abot 75 chapters or so I started to feel the series was repetitive with some ideas over used. But once you want to stop reading it, it beings you back in from random cases to plot effecting the characters whitch make me want to keep reading. \nPOSSABLE SPOILER it seems so far everyone has some\n          \n        kind of love intrest END SPOILER     \nto conclude you will love this series if you treat most cases as the \"plot\" and not a filler. \nIf you have patience and get into the characters you will enjoy as much as me.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="           \n    i love this manga\nit has a very smart storyline and if you love murder and mystery (which i absolutely do) you will most likely love it\nstory:\nthe story is quite enjoyable and i like the idea of shinichi now being a small child but still being far smarter than the average detective, it constantly leaves a smile on my face.\nart:\n*seethes* this is probably one of the worst parts of the manga. The art is quite bad and they tend to re-use character designs. Also, when they have someone who is supposed to be very attractive they aren't really that appealing to the eyes.\ncharacter:\ni like the characters.\n          \n        Most of them don't seem to be so appealing at the start but eventually they will grow on you and you'll come to love them. One thing i don't understand (so what if this isnt related to characters) is when conan ,who is only seven or so, asks policemen and witnesses questions, they answer him sincerely. Also in some cases he touches the murder weapons and things at the crime scene (and we all know the evidence needs to be preserved as it was at the time of the murder) and nobody thinks twice about it! But when he has a theory as to how the victim was killed nobody listens.\nAlright, the character one has gone on long enough! (and most of it had nothing to do with character, anyway)\nenjoyment:\ni really enjoyed this manga, it is funny, smart and impossible not to like! even though the art isn't that great, but the plot is quite unique and exciting, if you read it for long enough you'll realise the low quality of the art doesnt seem to have much of an effect on the enjoyment.\noverall:\n*see enjoyment*\nthough one thing i must add which really bugs me in the manga is that conan is always going off with his friends (who are only about seven) solving MURDERS! When i was seven i dont particularly remember solving any murders, do you?? also, ran and her \"detective\" father dont bat an eye when conan goes out by himself claiming he has something to do that he forgot about. He's seven, peoples, SEVEN! you dont let seven year olds go out into the city by themselves with no means of contact with their parents or whatever. . . . \n\nSEVEN!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="              \n    this isn't so much a review, as it is a guide to your full enjoyment. \nread the first 3 cases, if you liked them, you will love this manga, currently as of writing this, i'm in the 500 range, but i didn't update and when i left off i forgot how far i was, so i'm leaving this at 487. \ni am saying this that the first 3 cases are not spoiler and will only talk about the beginnings not the ends, as to not ruin it for you. \nthere are 3 case types:\nfirst there is the non event, basically they are not investigating anything\n          \n        serious.\nsecond is the its happens already puzzle. they stumble on stuff and solve it\nand third is the event case, its either they are there when it happens, or its a major story event. \nif you like all three of them, they only get better, they never feel repetitive, and if you read it only once, will never bore you. \nnow here is the main drawback of this manga, and its something that haunts it throughout, its that the art makes it VERY hard to remember or recognize any of the side characters off the bat, any ones you remember are main or semi recurring or you would have to be blind to and stupid to not remember them. get use to a character mentioned chapters ago to be forgotten completely. that is really the only drawback to this manga.\nill probably revise under this line every now and than, and ill date it too when i revise anything. \n10/29/10\n---------------------------------------------------------\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="            \n    Detective Conan is such a great manga that gives off twists and surprises in almost every corner. It provides a good amount of romance and comedy. It also provides suspense, especially in the different cases that Shinichi solves. Each mystery has an explanation, and each one is a unique one. Aside from the side mysteries which will leave you thinking out of the box, he main plot is as complex and exciting. I truly recommend that you read this exciting and very thrilling manga. You won't regret it. \n"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="           \n    When i first began watching the anime version of Detective Conan, the site i was watching only listed it as being 50 episodes long. Assuming that was all, i finished the 50 episodes only to discover that 50 was rather 600 + episodes. After making it to about episode 300, i abandoned the anime and decided to take on the challenge of the manga. \nTo start of, the pros of the manga. Although being a detective manga, you'd assume that the biggest pro should be the mystery cases and plot, for me, it's the characters. Although the characters seem to be nothing special at first,\n          \n        you soon find yourself adoring them. Gosho Aoyama has a special way of making the characters so relatable and fun, and all with unique and different personalities, you can't help but falling in love with them.As well, the interactions between the characters draw you in. The high school detective and his childhood friend (and love interest), as well the friendship between Shinichi and the high school detective of the west, Heiji Hattori, and the rivalry between the famous theif, Kaito Kid, and Shinichi.  I think the characters and their interactions with each other are the one thing that make this incredibly long manga bearable to read.\n\nThe next point is both a pro and a con. The story line is compelling and original, and the chapter with the Black Organization are thrilling. However, with one of the chapter only happening once every 50-100 chapters, the plot is very slow developing. The rest of the chapters, for the most part, involve case (mostly homicide). The cases are all very unique and creative, and would definietly appeal to any mystery novelist fan. However, the cases do have a tendency to become repetitive quickly. Although each murder is different, and the circumstances do vary, the idea of locked room murder, and others do repeat multiple times, and some sometimes do end up thinking \"not another locked room case\". However, not all the cases in between the BO ones are like this. Aoyama includes case involving Heiji Hattori (the loveable Osaka detective), Kaito Kid, and flashbacks to before Shinichi's body was shrunk which are all exciting and thrilling in their own way. So although some cases seem to get a bit repetitive and boring, you find yourself pushing through to reach one of the more exciting chapters (which happen frequently). \nThe art is neither a pro nor con. The art is fine, but it's not outstanding or special. It's a bit different from other mangas, but it's still a good style. However, although the main characters are all distingushable, many of the character designs to have a habit of looking similiar. Many side and minor characters can be easily forgotten, or look very similar to another character in the story. \nThe biggest con for this manga, for me, is the length. It's easy to get discouraged by the length, and there are times where it seems as though it's dragging on way too long. In my opinion , if anything could make this manga better, it would be a faster moving plot and less chapters. \nIn conclusion, if you enjoy reading detective stories, and look some really loveable, fun character and adorable romances and friendships, this manga is for you, so long as you don't mind the time commitment it may take. However, if you don't really love mysteries, don't read this manga. Although the characters and plot line are intresting, if you don't enjoy regular detective cases, you won't be able to get through the 800 + chapters of case files that this manga is.\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="              \n    Detective Conan is one of the greatest mangas of all time. It is very long and the ending is nowhere in sight, but I am nothing short of happy that it isnt ending any time soon.There is one thing I noticed about a majority of the cases, aside from how all the cases are complex and have a trick to them but Conan is able to solve them all. The cases usually have a distinct formulaic structure to them. Generally, chapter A is Conan and co. finding the body or crime scene, chapter B is introducing the suspects and usually ends with Conan mentally saying\n          \n        \"ah, so it's THAT person!\" and chapter C is the reveal of who the criminal is. A majority of the series are these recurring cases that have little to no plot relevance other than introducing new characters and develop some others. You'd think they get boring, but they don't, because finding out who the killer was and how is always enjoyable, so is meeting new characters. Within the sea of these cases lie two recurring ones. The showdowns between Conan and Kaito Kid, the protagonist of Magic Kaito (same author), and then the actual plot revolving around Conan investigating and trying to stop the organization that was responsible for shrinking him. Unlike the sherlock holmes-like mysteries that make up the cases, the plots with the organization take up a more thriller feel and show just how brilliant Conan is, while the showdowns with Kaito Kid are enjoyable battles of strategy in their own right. More and more characters show up and massive mysteries fill up the entire series, most of which have yet to be explained, but as we wait for them to be explained, we can just enjoy this superb masterpiece as it continues.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="           \n    Only one truth prevails! \nthis is one of the most iconic line you here from the wonderful detective series.\ndetective Conan (or case closed) is one of my favorite detective mystery series of all time, this was also the first manga and anime I watched while growing up.\nstory: 7\nthe story is about a 17yrs old teenage boy called Shuichi Kudo( or Jimmy Kudo) he is a world famous teenage detective and knew to solve case by case. but one day when going to the theme park with his \"friend\" Ran (or Rachel) he noticed something suspension going on, he saw a few shady guys doing a\n          \n        deal with this guy but when he wasn't looking, BAM he got knocked out and the shady dudes gave him a pill that would instantly kill him but nope! the turned into a 7 yrs old kid. to make sure that his identity isn't leaked, he turns his name into Conan Edogawa and lives in Ran's house to solve mysteries with her dad which is not a very good detective. to be honest, the plot gets used a lot and it sometimes gets tiring. but every murder and mystery is thought out and makes sense. (lol i never get any of them right). They do have a lot of genres in this: there is romance, thriller, horror, comedy, adventure, drama in this long running shounen series which i like a lot. what annoys me the most is that when Conan is about to reveal the truth, he always has to tranquilize Mr. Moore and that gets used a lot. though in the recent books that I read I guess the author also got tired of this method and changed things up a little bit. that's the reason why I took 3 points off of the story.\nArt:8\nThe story and art were drawn by Gosho Aoyama.It's decent art and it looks really nice! I don't really feel really drawn to the art, I mostly read Detective Conan for the story. the art really didn't have that much of an impact on me. but I have to say that good job on making murders look very scary! the fact that the killer usually is colored black until Conan reveals him/her that gives me chills! and also Gosho ayoma earlier Detective Conan manga the death scenes were really scary(or maybe I was like 9 when I was reading it  ;v;)  I also happy that there wasn't hiatus when he was writing the manga.\nCharacters: 9\nthe reason why I give it a pretty high score is that I love all of the Detective Conan characters. there are a lot of characters in this series, and it hard to give them spotlight every chapter and more of them only get one chapter of the spotlight. My favorite detective Conan character will have to be Ai haibara( Anita Hailey, Vi Greyheart), she the best girl of the series and I ships Conan and Ai! I really love her because she seems cold at first but is willing to go far to save the people she loves. In fact, she is willing to risk her life to save Conan! I guess the main reason is that she has no one in the world that she can call family but Conan and doctor agasa make her feel at home. She is also one of my favorite kuuderes( fact! she shares the same VA  as rei Ayami) Another thing i like about the characters are the relationships with one and other and the fact that there will always be romance in the junior detective leauge and that sato and tagis will always be interrupted when they try to kiss. ;-; The fact that the author makes different personalities for each character makes it even more fun to watch! You will be rutting for Conan for the whole time!~ \nEnjoyment:10 \nI enjoy this series a lot while growing up and still enjoy it today! what I also really like is that you don't need to know what happened in the first book in order to know what's happening in the other book! All the story, Art and characters together make this series the best detective manga in the whole history!  I really loved this show and in the fact that it was really original when it came out and it was fresh! this is definitely one of my favorite mangas out there! \nOVERALL SCORE: 9/10 \nGood job Conan!  \nʕ •ᴥ•ʔゝ☆ <certified bear approval\n        "},

I read it by never starting over even after taking long breaks from it just starting where I had left off last time when I had gotten bored.\nIf you want to read essentially 1000 one-shots based around the same character with a very loose unifying theme then this is the manga for you.\nDoesn't really do it for me even those the individual cases are rather interesting\n"},
