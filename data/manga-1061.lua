    Seeing as how few reviews of this – undoubtedly very popular and influential – manga there are, I thought that it deserved more attention and decided to write myself one.\
But before proceeding to the main body of the review I must mention that despite my personal tastes and subjectivity – as you can see I gave this manga the highest possible ranking – I understand that not everyone’s tastes coincide with mine, and I’m aware that some people may not like what I happen to like. That’s why in this review I will try to name all the ‘pro’ and ‘contra’ arguments as to if\
          \
        you should read this manga or not.\
 Also I must warn all potential readers that this review may contain MINOR SPOILERS – but I’m sure that everyone who considers a possibility of reading Detective Conan may already know that information, because, I think, before indulging oneself into a long read it is quite natural to look for some information about it on the Internet. Basically, these spoilers are well-known facts, but just in case – be alert.\
And last, but not least: this review is going to be a LONG one. If you don’t like big amounts of text, better stop reading now or skip the main part and go to the conclusion right away. But then again, if you think of reading DC, which is one of the most text-heavy mangas out there, that means you are prepared for reading quite a bit of text. So it would be better to read the whole review.\
Well, enough with the introduction. I’m fairly sure that nearly everyone had heard about the initial premise in DC. A high-school student, who also happens to be a genius detective, was turned into a grade-school kid by some mysterious organization, so he tries to uncover its evil deeds and get back to his original form, cracking alongside all the tough cases he encounters – his everyday life seems to be packed with them. Basically, that’s all that there is to it. But let’s dig a little deeper.\
One can divide the plot in DC into lesser sub-plots – Black Organization plot (considered to be main plot), Conan’s identity plot, multiple love storylines, Kaito Kid cases, cases concerning characters past, the so-called filler cases etc. Mind you, this division is not an ultimate one – sub-plots may differ depending on the story arc; there may be different opinions on the point of what to call a ‘plot’ – are the recurring characters enough or there must be a continuity of events; sub-plots tend to overlap in most of the cases.\
I haven’t done a statistical research as to how many chapters relate to the main plot, but I can surely tell that not many. Usually, BO cases happen once in 100 chapters – Gosho puts them as every new one-hundredth file (so all DC fans are now eagerly anticipating file 800). They provide elements of thriller, suspense and action in the series – in my opinion, they are excellent and really fire up mostly deduction-oriented plot. But that doesn’t mean that there is not enough space for the brain activity – they include intricate planning on both sides(Conan and BO), mind games like ‘I know what you think, but you know that I know, so I won’t do what you think I’ll do and will do that instead’. BO arcs are real gems and are definitely worth checking out.\
DC is also defined as ‘romance’ alongside with a detective – and that is no coincidence. We already have countless pairings in DC – some were added in 700+ chapters, and there are signs of more to come. Nearly every recurring character has a love story, or a love interest – even kids – so it is easy to conclude that DC is not only a detective manga. Personally, I like romance in DC, though a lot of people may find that love lines tend to drag on forever, and thus are not very enjoyable – that may be true, but nevertheless characters’ interaction is still good, and there are signs of speeding the love stories up(but these signs are visible in the 700+ chapters).\
I won’t say much about Conan’s identity plot in order to avoid spoilers – but they are also very good. I love to see how Conan tries to remain incognito and how smart he can be whenever he finds himself in a tough situation.\
Leaving other plots aside, the rest of the manga consists of cases, mostly murder ones. But I won’t call these cases ‘filler’, because they are nearly always intertwined with love stories, characters’ past or they may even give us hints considering the main plot – in my opinion, they are not ‘filler’. Fairly recently, though, there had been an increasing number of cases that have no relation to none of the plots whatsoever, and on top of that they weren’t interesting – maybe Gosho is running out of ideas. Time will tell if that assumption is valid – and I would even lower my ranking if that turns out to be the case, but now I think it’s too early for such a conclusion.\
Speaking of cases, they are, for the most part, very good. Having been raised on such fine examples of detective literature, such as works of Conan Doyle, Christie(my favourite author), Stout and many others, I thought that the cases in detective manga would be much worse – and I admit that I was wrong in that aspect. Yes, it would be an exaggeration to say that DC reaches the highest level of detective fiction, established by the above-mentioned authors – but in some cases it comes close to that.\
There are also certain types of cases that follow the usual pattern – three files on a single case (murder – investigation – solution), three suspects etc., but it’s only an outside similarity, every case is different. True, some ideas are used several times – for example, many cases feature technical devices and gimmicks to commit a crime(Gosho’s brother helps him to come up with sometimes elaborate ways of killing people); ‘dying messages’ are also frequently encountered, there is quite a number of ‘locked rooms’, but I can name only two or three examples of exact repetitiveness – a very small number if you think about the whole number of cases(and even in that situations, it was not enough to deduce the whole truth – mysteries also remained). So, in my opinion, DC is not repetitive – it only follows usual standards and patterns set up by the author, who also breaks them once in a while.\
I’ve already mentioned detective classics – if I were to compare DC to them, then surely it resembles Holmes’ stories the most – short, yet difficult, thought-provoking(even mind-boggling), original. Holmes is also often mentioned throughout the story – clearly he was the inspiration for the main character. Poirot’s influence is much lesser, but it is clearly felt in ‘isolated mansion’-type cases, and sometimes Poirot is mentioned directly (even the café the characters frequently visit is called ‘Poaro’). Other famous investigators mentioned in some way or another are Jules Maigret, Ellery Queen, Cordelia Gray, Victoria Warshawski, Kogorou Akechi etc., but as far as I can tell they are not much of an influence(except for Akechi, who’s clearly is a very important character, but I’m not very familiar with Japanese detective fiction). Another fact that proves Gosho is familiar with the classics of detective fiction is that he sometimes uses murder or alibi tricks described in famous detective novels in his own cases   – but rather than accusing Gosho of the lack of creativity, it can be considered as a fanservice to hardcore detective fans.\
What makes DC even more enjoyable apart from the mysteries is a wonderful cast of characters. Here you will find a variety of brilliant sleuths, dumb (though still loveable) police officers, ingenious (but not ingenious enough) culprits – everything you’d expect to find in a detective fiction. But that’s not all – comic interaction between characters provides consistent laughs throughout the manga. Memorable characters are a necessary component for a long-running series – when you get tired of complex murder plots, you still may want to continue reading because you have grown a strong bond to some characters – and that’s exactly the case with DC.  It is one of the strongest points of the manga – many people would find it interesting not because of the cases, but because of the characters in it.\
Throughout the seventeen years of its run, the artistic style of Gosho has changed (though it’s not as visible as in Magic Kaito) – from a more comic, light-hearted one (as in Yaiba) to a more serious one. Aoyama is a wonderful artist, and I love the way that he draws – even with attention to the utmost detail of surroundings, which can become one of the clues later on(so pay attention to the surroundings, it may help you uncover the truth before Conan). Character design is also very good – I’m talking about the main ones (minor characters, which differ from case to case, are often drawn similarly, but I don’t consider it a shortcoming) – it makes the characters even more loveable. But I must say that the drawing style is quite different from what you will find in other mangas, so it may take you some time to get accustomed to it. After a while, I think you will get used to it.\
Having finished the general overview, I also feel obliged to say about some aspects of DC that will make this review more thorough – I think that these points would help to determine if this manga is for you or not.\
The first of these points will be the one addressed to anime-centric fans. Despite this review being the one based on the manga, I can’t omit the manga-anime comparison. ‘There’s an anime more than 600 episodes long, why should I read the manga then?’ – You may ask. Here is my advice: if you decide to dive into DC, start with the manga. Yes, the anime is well-made, follows the manga closely, features a superb seiyuu cast, but manga is better. The reason for this is the beginning – major anime changes led TMS into trouble, though later problems were resolved, but not very smoothly. Since then, luckily animators haven’t improvised, but to have a full grasp of events I suggest you read the manga first, and always keep this schedule – to be ahead in manga in terms of plot development. After all, it’s the original.\
One more thing – if you want to read this manga, then it would be better to obtain a licensed version (Viz Media currently has it covered up to volume 41, I guess), and then read the scanlation. Why? Because it’s legal and because the quality of many scans from around volume 20 to volume 40 is horrible – bad image quality, often from Chinese or Vietnamese sources, poor translation with spelling and grammar errors, which make some cases very difficult to understand. So, be warned: if you decide to go on a long detective journey, your happiness may be overshadowed by poor scans – so choose the legal version.\
Another point of concern is possibly the detective nature of the manga. In short, it is nothing but cases. For a detective fiction lover, it is close to heaven. For someone, who has no thing for a crime literature, the whole thing may be boring and tedious. ‘One case after another – what’s the point of this?’ – I can hear such a question. If you don’t see the point of solving cases with powers of deduction and logic, then I’m afraid I can’t help you. Then I suggest you to avoid DC.\
There’s yet one more warning I must issue – having run for 17 years, DC, as every long-running manga, features a very slow plot development. What’s more – it doesn’t seem to end in the near future. Gosho said that he won’t overcome ‘Kochikame!’ by a number of volumes, so all we can say is that there will be no more than 170 volumes (right now 74 volumes of DC were published). Judging by the fact that there are multiple conflicts to resolve, that new characters are introduced in 700+ chapters, and DC is still among the best-selling manga in Japan, I can say that it will run for 5-10 years at least, and it will be no surprise for me if Gosho isn’t even halfway through the manga. So, if you don’t like to wait in anticipation every week or two for a new file to come out(and for a very long time also), better don’t start reading it now – it would be better to read 1500+chapters 15 years later when the manga is finished(I hope).\
So, to sum it all up, if you’re not a detective fan, do not like slow plot development and are strongly opposed to long-running series with no end in the near future – DC is not a manga I would suggest you to read.\
If, on the other hand, you like classic crime fiction and don’t mind a lengthy, but otherwise worthy read – I strongly recommend Detective Conan to you as one of the best(if not the best) examples of the detective manga. Moreover, other examples of detective genre in manga like Kindaichi or Tantei Gakuen Q are very hard to obtain and require other-than-English language knowledge, while DC certainly beats Zodiac P.I., Remote and other detective mangas. And if you choose DC for its cases, as an option, you would receive great and suspenseful overarching plot, touching romantic storylines, excellent comic moments and a memorable cast of characters. Clearly, DC is more than just detective manga – that’s what makes it really special.\
For all of you detective fiction lovers out there, there is only one truth – read Detective Conan now!",

    The first time I read this series was when I happened to pick up a copy at the library.  At first, didn't really think much of it, but eventually it's grown on me.\
Story: most of the cases they present are really entertaining, and often suspenseful.  I find myself anticipating what will happen and I enjoy the suspense; I think that's what pulls you to the story.  However, having read so many chapters now, with almost one case every 2-3 chapters, you start to find some ideas being repetitive.  Overall though, it's still good.\
Art: not much to say for art.  It's\
          \
        a little different to the typical drawings of manga, but that doesn't make it bad.  The more you read, the less you'll mind the drawings.  \
Characters: repetitive use of characters can be good or bad.  Good thing is you familiarize yourself with them, bad thing is it does at time get boring.  However, I like the cast of conan, it fits with the story pretty well, so, in this case I don't mind repetition :)\
Enjoyment: same as for the story.  At first it's very thrilling but I find it's slightly repetitive now, so it's not as good as when I first read it.  But the cases itself are really cool, you learn a lot of new things.  Sure, not all the things are probably accurate, but they are cool nontheless.\
Overall: I think the only two aspects that kind of pulls it down the score are story and characters.  But overall, it's worth a read if you're into crime solving stories.  There's also slight comic relief in this manga which contrasts nicely to the seriousness of the cases.  \

    Right let start at the beginning, this is my first review \"EVER\".\
Now onto the review,\
When I got to this manga I expected there to be some stories that I would not enjoy and some stories that I would enjoy.\
This manga's story regarding the BO is brilliant everything surrounding them is well planned and executed however the other stories regarding investigations after a while got so boring that I wanted to quit multiple time over because they were basically the same with different characters which made the reading more of a chore instead of enjoyment.\
Story;\
For me the actual cannon material that I mentioned above \"The Black\
          \
        Organisation\" is the most amazing stuff you can find anywhere, it grips you and doesn't let go until the end. However the filler arcs are my problem at first I thought like this wow its pretty okay, after 200 or chapters of filler I wanted to k*ll myself but instead of doing so I took a break for a few weeks and continued onwards until the point where I had to take a break again because it was so boring.\
Characters;\
Throughout the story we meets thousands of different characters however they are mostly minor and almost never reappear again, with them I have no problems whatsoever because I know that there is no need to develop minor characters that will disappear in a few chapters. My main problems are with Ran, Mouri, Kazuha, some police detectives. Starting off with Ran she witnessed hundreds of cases but still believes there are ghosts when people say so = where is the logic in that???, next Mouri over the 924 I have not seen any character development whatsoever which is to say that he was retarder and will continue being retarded, Kazuha with her I don't have much of a problem because she is a minor character that appear rarely but she is basically like Ran but practises a different Martial Art. And Lastlty detectives in this story are even more stupid than or are on the same level as Mouri for example; A kid says something relevant to the case, what do the detective do? scream at them for interfering. Great Huh?\
Art;\
To be honest I don't have anything about the art it is pretty decent.\
Enjoyment;\
Overall my enjoyment of the series has been killed by the continuous filler arcs which ruin the entire series. The ONLY time I was enjoying myself was when the story revolved around THE BLACK ORGANISATION.\
Thanks for reading \"if you finished anyway\"",

    Me having no life I been able to read almost 500 chapters of case closed. I\
must say this series about as old as me is a good series. What first grabed my attention in this book was the way the crimes were pulled off and I stayed hooked. \
After abot 75 chapters or so I started to feel the series was repetitive with some ideas over used. But once you want to stop reading it, it beings you back in from random cases to plot effecting the characters whitch make me want to keep reading. \

    i love this manga\
it has a very smart storyline and if you love murder and mystery (which i absolutely do) you will most likely love it\
story:\
the story is quite enjoyable and i like the idea of shinichi now being a small child but still being far smarter than the average detective, it constantly leaves a smile on my face.\
art:\
*seethes* this is probably one of the worst parts of the manga. The art is quite bad and they tend to re-use character designs. Also, when they have someone who is supposed to be very attractive they aren't really that appealing to the eyes.\
character:\
i like the characters.\
          \
        Most of them don't seem to be so appealing at the start but eventually they will grow on you and you'll come to love them. One thing i don't understand (so what if this isnt related to characters) is when conan ,who is only seven or so, asks policemen and witnesses questions, they answer him sincerely. Also in some cases he touches the murder weapons and things at the crime scene (and we all know the evidence needs to be preserved as it was at the time of the murder) and nobody thinks twice about it! But when he has a theory as to how the victim was killed nobody listens.\
Alright, the character one has gone on long enough! (and most of it had nothing to do with character, anyway)\
enjoyment:\
i really enjoyed this manga, it is funny, smart and impossible not to like! even though the art isn't that great, but the plot is quite unique and exciting, if you read it for long enough you'll realise the low quality of the art doesnt seem to have much of an effect on the enjoyment.\
overall:\
*see enjoyment*\
though one thing i must add which really bugs me in the manga is that conan is always going off with his friends (who are only about seven) solving MURDERS! When i was seven i dont particularly remember solving any murders, do you?? also, ran and her \"detective\" father dont bat an eye when conan goes out by himself claiming he has something to do that he forgot about. He's seven, peoples, SEVEN! you dont let seven year olds go out into the city by themselves with no means of contact with their parents or whatever. . . . \

    this isn't so much a review, as it is a guide to your full enjoyment. \
read the first 3 cases, if you liked them, you will love this manga, currently as of writing this, i'm in the 500 range, but i didn't update and when i left off i forgot how far i was, so i'm leaving this at 487. \
i am saying this that the first 3 cases are not spoiler and will only talk about the beginnings not the ends, as to not ruin it for you. \
there are 3 case types:\
first there is the non event, basically they are not investigating anything\
          \
        serious.\
second is the its happens already puzzle. they stumble on stuff and solve it\
and third is the event case, its either they are there when it happens, or its a major story event. \
if you like all three of them, they only get better, they never feel repetitive, and if you read it only once, will never bore you. \
now here is the main drawback of this manga, and its something that haunts it throughout, its that the art makes it VERY hard to remember or recognize any of the side characters off the bat, any ones you remember are main or semi recurring or you would have to be blind to and stupid to not remember them. get use to a character mentioned chapters ago to be forgotten completely. that is really the only drawback to this manga.\
ill probably revise under this line every now and than, and ill date it too when i revise anything. \

    Detective Conan is such a great manga that gives off twists and surprises in almost every corner. It provides a good amount of romance and comedy. It also provides suspense, especially in the different cases that Shinichi solves. Each mystery has an explanation, and each one is a unique one. Aside from the side mysteries which will leave you thinking out of the box, he main plot is as complex and exciting. I truly recommend that you read this exciting and very thrilling manga. You won't regret it. \

    When i first began watching the anime version of Detective Conan, the site i was watching only listed it as being 50 episodes long. Assuming that was all, i finished the 50 episodes only to discover that 50 was rather 600 + episodes. After making it to about episode 300, i abandoned the anime and decided to take on the challenge of the manga. \
To start of, the pros of the manga. Although being a detective manga, you'd assume that the biggest pro should be the mystery cases and plot, for me, it's the characters. Although the characters seem to be nothing special at first,\
          \
        you soon find yourself adoring them. Gosho Aoyama has a special way of making the characters so relatable and fun, and all with unique and different personalities, you can't help but falling in love with them.As well, the interactions between the characters draw you in. The high school detective and his childhood friend (and love interest), as well the friendship between Shinichi and the high school detective of the west, Heiji Hattori, and the rivalry between the famous theif, Kaito Kid, and Shinichi.  I think the characters and their interactions with each other are the one thing that make this incredibly long manga bearable to read.\
\
The next point is both a pro and a con. The story line is compelling and original, and the chapter with the Black Organization are thrilling. However, with one of the chapter only happening once every 50-100 chapters, the plot is very slow developing. The rest of the chapters, for the most part, involve case (mostly homicide). The cases are all very unique and creative, and would definietly appeal to any mystery novelist fan. However, the cases do have a tendency to become repetitive quickly. Although each murder is different, and the circumstances do vary, the idea of locked room murder, and others do repeat multiple times, and some sometimes do end up thinking \"not another locked room case\". However, not all the cases in between the BO ones are like this. Aoyama includes case involving Heiji Hattori (the loveable Osaka detective), Kaito Kid, and flashbacks to before Shinichi's body was shrunk which are all exciting and thrilling in their own way. So although some cases seem to get a bit repetitive and boring, you find yourself pushing through to reach one of the more exciting chapters (which happen frequently). \
The art is neither a pro nor con. The art is fine, but it's not outstanding or special. It's a bit different from other mangas, but it's still a good style. However, although the main characters are all distingushable, many of the character designs to have a habit of looking similiar. Many side and minor characters can be easily forgotten, or look very similar to another character in the story. \
The biggest con for this manga, for me, is the length. It's easy to get discouraged by the length, and there are times where it seems as though it's dragging on way too long. In my opinion , if anything could make this manga better, it would be a faster moving plot and less chapters. \
In conclusion, if you enjoy reading detective stories, and look some really loveable, fun character and adorable romances and friendships, this manga is for you, so long as you don't mind the time commitment it may take. However, if you don't really love mysteries, don't read this manga. Although the characters and plot line are intresting, if you don't enjoy regular detective cases, you won't be able to get through the 800 + chapters of case files that this manga is.\

    Detective Conan is one of the greatest mangas of all time. It is very long and the ending is nowhere in sight, but I am nothing short of happy that it isnt ending any time soon.There is one thing I noticed about a majority of the cases, aside from how all the cases are complex and have a trick to them but Conan is able to solve them all. The cases usually have a distinct formulaic structure to them. Generally, chapter A is Conan and co. finding the body or crime scene, chapter B is introducing the suspects and usually ends with Conan mentally saying\
          \
        \"ah, so it's THAT person!\" and chapter C is the reveal of who the criminal is. A majority of the series are these recurring cases that have little to no plot relevance other than introducing new characters and develop some others. You'd think they get boring, but they don't, because finding out who the killer was and how is always enjoyable, so is meeting new characters. Within the sea of these cases lie two recurring ones. The showdowns between Conan and Kaito Kid, the protagonist of Magic Kaito (same author), and then the actual plot revolving around Conan investigating and trying to stop the organization that was responsible for shrinking him. Unlike the sherlock holmes-like mysteries that make up the cases, the plots with the organization take up a more thriller feel and show just how brilliant Conan is, while the showdowns with Kaito Kid are enjoyable battles of strategy in their own right. More and more characters show up and massive mysteries fill up the entire series, most of which have yet to be explained, but as we wait for them to be explained, we can just enjoy this superb masterpiece as it continues.\

    Only one truth prevails! \
this is one of the most iconic line you here from the wonderful detective series.\
detective Conan (or case closed) is one of my favorite detective mystery series of all time, this was also the first manga and anime I watched while growing up.\
story: 7\
the story is about a 17yrs old teenage boy called Shuichi Kudo( or Jimmy Kudo) he is a world famous teenage detective and knew to solve case by case. but one day when going to the theme park with his \"friend\" Ran (or Rachel) he noticed something suspension going on, he saw a few shady guys doing a\
          \
        deal with this guy but when he wasn't looking, BAM he got knocked out and the shady dudes gave him a pill that would instantly kill him but nope! the turned into a 7 yrs old kid. to make sure that his identity isn't leaked, he turns his name into Conan Edogawa and lives in Ran's house to solve mysteries with her dad which is not a very good detective. to be honest, the plot gets used a lot and it sometimes gets tiring. but every murder and mystery is thought out and makes sense. (lol i never get any of them right). They do have a lot of genres in this: there is romance, thriller, horror, comedy, adventure, drama in this long running shounen series which i like a lot. what annoys me the most is that when Conan is about to reveal the truth, he always has to tranquilize Mr. Moore and that gets used a lot. though in the recent books that I read I guess the author also got tired of this method and changed things up a little bit. that's the reason why I took 3 points off of the story.\
Art:8\
The story and art were drawn by Gosho Aoyama.It's decent art and it looks really nice! I don't really feel really drawn to the art, I mostly read Detective Conan for the story. the art really didn't have that much of an impact on me. but I have to say that good job on making murders look very scary! the fact that the killer usually is colored black until Conan reveals him/her that gives me chills! and also Gosho ayoma earlier Detective Conan manga the death scenes were really scary(or maybe I was like 9 when I was reading it  ;v;)  I also happy that there wasn't hiatus when he was writing the manga.\
Characters: 9\
the reason why I give it a pretty high score is that I love all of the Detective Conan characters. there are a lot of characters in this series, and it hard to give them spotlight every chapter and more of them only get one chapter of the spotlight. My favorite detective Conan character will have to be Ai haibara( Anita Hailey, Vi Greyheart), she the best girl of the series and I ships Conan and Ai! I really love her because she seems cold at first but is willing to go far to save the people she loves. In fact, she is willing to risk her life to save Conan! I guess the main reason is that she has no one in the world that she can call family but Conan and doctor agasa make her feel at home. She is also one of my favorite kuuderes( fact! she shares the same VA  as rei Ayami) Another thing i like about the characters are the relationships with one and other and the fact that there will always be romance in the junior detective leauge and that sato and tagis will always be interrupted when they try to kiss. ;-; The fact that the author makes different personalities for each character makes it even more fun to watch! You will be rutting for Conan for the whole time!~ \
Enjoyment:10 \
I enjoy this series a lot while growing up and still enjoy it today! what I also really like is that you don't need to know what happened in the first book in order to know what's happening in the other book! All the story, Art and characters together make this series the best detective manga in the whole history!  I really loved this show and in the fact that it was really original when it came out and it was fresh! this is definitely one of my favorite mangas out there! \
OVERALL SCORE: 9/10 \

    hummm let me put it this way\
It took me about 3 years to read\
That is all\
I'm not even joking this manga is fun to read and all but it sooooooo long and soooooooo repititive.  I read it by never starting over even after taking long breaks from it just starting where I had left off last time when I had gotten bored.\
If you want to read essentially 1000 one-shots based around the same character with a very loose unifying theme then this is the manga for you.\
Doesn't really do it for me even those the individual cases are rather interesting\

He makes his living with a wide number of patents and inventions, mostly video games (of whom the Detective Boys are enthusiastic test players). He has been a friend of Shinichi and Ran since their childhood years.  \
 After Shinichi had been shrunk by the APTX 4869, the first person he met and entrusted himself to was Agasa. After having been convinced that the little boy was Shinichi, Agasa was also the first one to advise Shinichi to exercise caution in his pursuit of the Black Organization. He also helped Shinichi in establishing his new identity as Edogawa Conan, including constructing several gadgets which help Shinichi in carrying on his detective work surreptitiously, and in order to perfect Conan's cover, he also enlisted him into Teitan Elementary and thus came to know the children who would form the Detective Boys. When Miyano Shiho fled the clutches of the Black Organization, she fled to Shinichi's house but collapsed from exhaustion before Agasa's doorstep. Agasa subsequently took her in, learned about her true identity and helped her establish her new identity as Haibara Ai. He also entrusted Shinichi's parents with the secret about what has happened to their son.\
 \
 Ever since these beginnings, Agasa has been an invaluable friend for Shinichi and the Detective Boys as a confidant, paternal friend, and someone to hang out with. He often takes the children on trips, most of which turn into criminal cases instead. \
 \
 Agasa is a jovial and outgoing person and has many friends in his community, a fact which helped him in his covering up of Conan's and Haibara's true origins (he simply claims that they are the children of his friends and acquaintances).\
 \
 Agasa has a special love for pasta and tomato juice.\

 Relatives: Kudou Yuusaku (father) & Kudou Yukiko (mother)\
 Nicknames: Cool Kid (Jodie Starling), Cool Guy (Vermouth), Silver Bullet-kun (Vermouth), Glasses Kid (Sonoko Suzuki), Holmes' Apprentice (Apollo & Minerva Glass)\
 \
 At the beginning of the series, Kudou Shinichi is a 17-year-old student at Teitan High School. He is already well-known as a brilliant young detective, the \"Savior of the police force,\" for solving many difficult cases that the professionals could not. However, while investigating two mysterious men, he is spotted and forced to swallow an experimental poison known as APTX 4869. This results in his body shrinking to that of a 6-year-old.\
 \
 Shinichi comes up with the alias Conan Edogawa after Arthur Conan Doyle and Edogawa Rampo and pretends to be a distant relative of Agasa's who places Conan in Ran's care. Ran's father Mouri Kogorou, owns a Detective Agency which Conan uses to his advantage to discover cases involving the Black Organization.\
 \
 As Conan, Shinichi helps Ran's father solve cases by putting him to sleep and simulating Kogorou's voice using the special bowtie gadget Professor Agasa made for him. By solving cases one after the other, he helps build up Kogorou's reputation who will later on be referred to as \"Sleeping Kogorou.\" He also spends a good amount of time with his Detective Boys fellows and solves many small cases with them and sometimes in the company of Professor Agasa.\
 \
 Conan remains very close to Ran, who in return is very protective of him. However, because Ran is unaware of his true identity, Conan often finds himself in awkward situations with her, such as when she confessed her feeling for Shinichi to him and when she made him bathe with her at a hot spring.\
 \
 Conan's intelligence remains intact even though he has shrunken into a child. As Shinichi, his deductive ability earned him the monikers \"Heisei Holmes\" and \"Savior of the Japanese police force.\" Conan maintains an extraordinarily broad knowledge of many subjects and trivia that help him solve cases and escape tricky situations. Conan tries to speak in a child-like manner when dealing with adults, but he often gets caught up in the current case and begins speaking like an adult, referring to advanced topics and using reasoning much too complex for a normal child. When this happens, he often tries to pass it off as \"something [he] heard on TV\" or \"taught by uncle Kogoro/professor Agasa/Shinichi-niichan.\"\
 \
 \
 Likewise, he makes no effort to hide his love for Sherlock Holmes and soccer, so if he called out for talking about either subject in too much detail, he tries to escape suspicion by saying it was something Shinichi told him about. Although as the series has progressed the adults around him have become more used to his \"being quite smart for a child,\" causing him to behave more like himself around them, he still tries to pass as a normal child. The only police officers with whom Conan can speak in a professional manner are the FBI, especially Jodie Starling, Shuichi Akai, James Black, and Inspector Kansuke Yamato of the Nagano Police, all of whom suspect that there is more to Conan than meets the eye.\
 \
 Conan tends to act more like himself around the Detective Boys, even to the point that they find it odd when he acts like a child around adults. He will often play games like baseball with the Detective Boys, but he is too used to soccer to perform well and will even instinctively use soccer techniques, such as kicking in games that do not call for it. Because he is unfamiliar with popular games and TV shows, and bad at video games, Genta and the others tend to think of him as dumb. This annoys Conan so much that he will secretly watch TV in the living room after Kogoro and Ran go to sleep to get more \"practice\" in.\

Formerly Sherry of the Black Organization, she is on the run from them and lives with Professor Agasa. She is also one of few characters who knows Shinichi is Conan.  \
 Miyano Shiho and her older sister, Miyano Akemi, were born into the secret crime syndicate \"The Black Organization.\" Her English mother, Miyano Elena, and her Japanese father, Miyano Atsushi, were both scientists working for the Black Organization on an important secret project. While Haibara was young, both her parents died in what was claimed to be an accident. While Akemi lived a normal life, the highly intelligent Haibara was groomed to take over her parents' research. A child prodigy, she was sent to the United States for education at a very young age, and then later came back to Japan to finish her parents' secret project.\
 \
 Shiho was unhappy that the Black Organization's was using the incomplete APTX 4869 for murder, as that was not the drug's intended purpose. When Shiho received word that her sister Akemi had been killed, but was given no explanation why, she decided to boycott her research until the Black Organization gave her an adequate explanation. Instead, the Organization confined her in a small room to await her execution. With no other way out, she took a pill of APTX 4869 to commit suicide, but instead shrank into an eight year old girl. In her new, smaller body, she escaped from the Black Organization and attempted to reach Shinichi's house, hoping he might be able to help her. Exhausted, she collapsed in front of Shinichi's house, where she was found by Professor Agasa, who took her in. In fact, as it turned out later, Agasa was acquaintances with her parents&mdash;especially her father&mdash;even though he didn't know at that time that they had children or were part of the Black Organization.\
 \
 To prevent the knowledge of her transfiguration from being discovered, Shiho and Professor Agasa create her alias Haibara Ai. As Haibara, she attends Teitan Elementary School with Kudou Shinichi's shrunken form, Edogawa Conan. Following her first adventure with the Detective Boys in which they investigate the disappearance of a schoolmate's brother, she reveals her true identity to Conan and the fact that she had developed the APTX 4869. At first stunned, then outraged, Conan protests her presence, but as time passes, he accepts Haibara as a friend and fellow victim, though her cynicism and secretive air still rail him at times. Haibara also joins the ranks of the Detective Boys, and although she does not think too highly of her teammates' immature antics, she has come to value them all as close friends.\
 \
 Haibara has a calm and cool personality, sarcastic wit, and high intelligence. When freshly escaped from the Black Organization, she was cynical and pushed others away. Haibara has since defrosted by embracing her new child life and has established strong relationships with Conan, the Detective Boys, Agasa, and Ran.\
 \
 She tries to keep Conan from doing reckless things that may give away their identity, though often she is surprised by his actions which usually result in gaining the information he needs while also keeping their identities secret. However, whenever Conan is reckless in regards to keeping his identity from Ran, Haibara is the one who plans ahead in order to keep him from being revealed.\

Shortly afterwards, he and his classmate Ayumi decide to investigate an apparently haunted mansion, and they persuade Conan to come along. When their friend and classmate Mitsuhiko expresses his skepticism about supernatural hauntings, Genta forcefully 'persuades' him to tag along as well. As it turns out, the haunting is a cover-up for an old homicide case. \
 Soon after, the accidental acquisition of a treasure map leads Ayumi, Genta, Mistuhiko and Conan on a hunt for a cache of stolen Italian gold coins, during which Conan saves them from getting killed by the mafia members who are also after the gold. After the case is resolved, Mitsuhiko joins Genta and Ayumi in forming the nucleus of an amateur detective group, the Detective Boys. Genta is quick to pronounce himself the leader of the group, but his lackadaisical leadership abilities are commonly neglected in the field, and in fact everyone (even Genta) unconsciously views Conan as the group's actual leader. Genta's school shoe locker is used as a mailbox for any of their fellow students to present them with a case to solve. \
 \
 Genta loves food, especially unagi, and can eat more than all the other Detective Boys members combined. When discussions of money come up, Genta tends to think about it in terms of how many unagi bowls he could buy. He also tends to mess up certain Japanese terms with similar-sounding words (especially if the latter are related to food) and sometimes has trouble reading even the most common Kanji, which on occasion causes some ridicule from his classmates and friends. His brash personality, lack of awareness of his surroundings, and tendency to not think before acting often lands the Detective Boys (or at least himself) in sticky situations.\
 \
 Even though he is brash, outspoken and can be intimidating, Genta is actually very kind and dependable. He is a good friend of Ayumi and Mitsuhiko, and has been shown to greatly admire his father, who is considered to be a classic \"Child of Edo\".\

      description = "Mouri Ran is a childhood friend of Kudou Shinichi. She is the daughter of Mouri Kogorou, a private detective, and Kisaki Eri, a lawyer. Her parents got separated when she was seven, and one of her biggest goals is to get them back together. Her best friend next to Shinichi is her classmate Suzuki Sonoko, who constantly teases her about her relationship with Shinichi. \
 After Shinichi's disappearance, Ran met Edogawa Conan, who was introduced by Professor Agasa as a \"distant relative\" and asked Ran if she wouldn't mind taking care of him at her house. She and her father practically adopted him; Ran immediately came to think of him as a surrogate little brother. Little did (and still does) Ran know that \"Conan\" is actually Shinichi.\
 \
 Ran's greatest personality trait is that she genuinely cares for those she loves. She is also patient, kind, and nurturing. Like Shinichi, she highly values justice to the point of idealism. To avoid making Shinichi choose between her and his important case (really an excuse because Shinichi has turned into Conan and can't return), she has decided to wait for him to finish it, trusting his promise that he will come back despite their separation causing Ran a lot of emotional pain. Ran is also very hot-blooded and tends to act on impulses when the people she cares about are involved; the combination of jumping to conclusions and not hesitating to use karate on those who she perceives to have wronged someone have led to several \"near-miss\" misunderstandings. Early on, she would become violently suspicious if she thought Shinichi was philandering although more recently his confessions have lead her to trust his intentions. Even though Ran is in love with Shinichi, she often fails to convey her feelings because she suddenly becomes self conscious.\
 \
 She can be very brave and resourceful when she wants to be, and rescues Conan from trouble on occasion. However, she has an irrational fear of the supernatural and is thus&mdash;unlike her friend Sonoko&mdash;absolutely no fan of anything related to the horror genre. She also constantly tries to reunite her father and mother again - though with little success, thanks to the mutual stubbornness of both parents. Men also tend to pay her a lot of undue romantic attention, a fact that makes Sonoko somewhat jealous (and of which Ran herself is completely unaware).\
 \
 Ran is very self sufficient for her age. This is because her father is drunk, slovenly, and fiscally irresponsible. She handles many of the Mouri household's financial affairs and all the cooking and housework. She also ensures Kogorou doesn't slack off on his job, is on his best behavior for client meetings, and she often greets and provides refreshments for potential clients.\

Some time ago, he worked in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Division One with Inspector Megure, but while an excellent marksman he was not a particularly good investigator. Around the time Mouri left the police force, his wife Kisaki Eri also moved out, though they have never officially divorced despite ten years having passed. \
 Mouri has an overinflated sense of his own importance and detective prowess to the point where he doesn't investigate why he is suddenly and consistently passing out at crime scenes and solving cases in his sleep with different deductions than he was making while awake. He is also frequently unprofessional in his work, frequently making sarcastic and blunt comments about suspects or even his own clients. \
 \
 On cases, Mouri is typically lax with his deductions and investigation, following only the most obvious clues or assumptions to reach his conclusions, which are often silly or fall directly into a culprit's trap. The police, especially Megure, often find him to be an embarrassment while awake and hope to see \"Nemuri no Kogorou\"  (Sleeping Detective) as soon as possible. Mouri does have a serious side which only emerges when the case has personal importance to him, such as when Eri and Ran are involved. When this happens, Mouri's entire personality and demeanor changes and he begins acting professionally, demonstrating improved deductive skills and cunning. While he is not up to the standards of Shinichi and he still can have problems with finding clues, his logical reasoning becomes better, and Mouri often demonstrates he has a better sense of interpersonal relationships than Shinichi does.\
 \
 Mouri easily becomes infatuated with beautiful women. His favorite celebrity is pop idol Okino Yoko, and he never misses (or tries not to miss) her television shows. He also keeps a large collection of Yoko related goods and his office and bedroom have Yoko posters. Because of his flirtatious behavior around attractive women, he often embarrasses Ran, and while it is not stated as the reason why Eri left him, it is one of the primary reasons why she hasn't come back.\
 \
 While never outright called an alcoholic, Mouri has a tendency to get intoxicated and Shinichi/Conan often makes sarcastic remarks about him spending money on alcohol. In the anime, particularly in early episodes, his office is littered with empty beer cans, and he keeps a well-stocked liquor shelf. Mouri is also a heavy smoker, and is usually seen with a cigarette in his mouth. Other hobbies include watching his favorite idol star, Okino Yoko, betting on horse races, playing mahjong (which he tends to lose) and playing or watching baseball (he even plays in his neighborhood's team). \
 \
 In the movies, Mouri suffers from a mild acrophobia (fear of heights) and is quite uncomfortable in high settings where he has the chance to see how high up he is. He does not have this fear in the manga. \

 \
 Mitsuhiko enjoys reading science books and takes a scientific approach to problem-solving. He is a smart and well-read first-grader who believes that technology can solve most problems. Due to his strict and formal upbringing, he tends to be very formal towards his elders, addressing them with the formal suffix \"-san\" without regard to the intimacy of their relationship. \

 As it turned out, the haunting served as a cover-up for an old homicide case.

For a time, Ayumi was the sole female member of the Detective Boys until Haibara joined the group. During a case involving a cache of stolen Italian gold coins just prior to the official formation of the Detective Boys, Conan saved the group from getting killed by the Mafioso who were also after the gold, earning Ayumi's gratitude which quickly developed into a serious crush.\
 \
 Ayumi is a naive and innocent little girl who shows courage from time to time and acts as the team's cheerful spirit. She has an open crush on Conan, which makes him uncomfortable, though Ayumi thinks that he has feelings for Haibara because he tries to protect her and she often sees them talking amongst themselves in private. Ayumi later becomes better friends with Haibara, and she allows Ayumi to use the more informal term Ai-\"chan\" to address her.\
 \
 When on a case, Ayumi often makes really simple observations that allows its progress and resolution. For instance, she unlocked one of the codes from the Momotaro container the Detective Boys found in Kurashiki by deducing that it was most likely referring to one of the statues at the Oohara Art Museum: they had to walk 25 steps from the statue towards the direction it was facing.\

In order to facilitate the latter, and later because he had genuinely developed feelings for Akemi, Akai saw himself forced to break up his then on-going relationship with Jodie. Later on, his cover in the Black Organization was accidentally blown by his colleague Andre Camel, and when Akemi was killed, he declared her murderer, Gin (with whom he seems to have had some tensions even before his exposure), his personal enemy. \
 Akai is a very professional agent. Even in personal matters, he remains cool, even detached, from anyone, but his redeeming value is a great sense of loyalty to anyone he knows.

Calvados repeatedly tries to shoot her down (despite Vermouth's orders to stop) and misses, he stops when Vermouth shoots a bullet in his direction. Akai Shuuichi later breaks both of Calvados legs and takes his rifle, shotgun and 3 handguns. He later commits suicide in order to avoid being taken prisoner for questioning. \
 \
 Calvados was one of many snipers hired for the Black Organization. He appeared to have had an infatuation with Vermouth, which Vermouth had used to her advantage. He also appeared to have had some sort of connection with other snipers such as Chianti and Korn. His favorite weapon was said to have been his shotgun. \

 Fusae Campbell is of Japanese-American descent and has the unusual feature (for a Japanese) of blond hair. Feeling self-conscious about this (presumably aided by some teasing from intolerant schoolmates), she became very timid and came to wear a low hat to cover her hair.\
 \
 When she was in fourth grade, Fusae met Agasa Hiroshi, who helped her overcome her timidness. The two became very fond of each other, especially since Agasa did not ridicule her for her hair color, but Fusae soon had to move away before she could confess her feelings for him. In a letter she left, she promised that once every ten years she would wait for Agasa at \"the place of memories\" (the ginkgo trees behind Teitan elementary school) until he met up with her, but the hints she left were too complicated for Agasa to crack, and it was not until 40 years later the two were finally reunited with the help of the Detective Boys. By that time Fusae had become a successful fashion designer, with a ginkgo leaf being her trademark signature (because Agasa had commented on her hair looking like ginkgo leaves in the fall).\
 \
 While the two parted inconclusively because of mistaken conceptions about the other, they did recognize each other, and Agasa was able to make his feelings known to her. Whether the two will meet anytime soon remains to be seen.\
 \
 She has one foreign English speaking parent. Her stepdad has a friend named Billy whose wife likes the ginkgo leaf themed purses Fusae designs. \
 \
 Fusae has a kind and caring personality, evidenced when she loaned Ran her umbrella while waiting for Agasa ten years prior to the current timeline.\

He enlisted into Teitan High School and quickly made friends with Mouri Ran and Suzuki Sonoko, who noticed the striking similarity to Mizunashi. \
 Some time later, Eisuke visited Ran's father in his office, where he also ran into Conan. After expressing a vivid interest in Mouri's work, he was invited by Ran to come by anytime, much to the displeasure of Conan, who had become suspicious of Eisuke. This suspicion was confirmed by the fact that in subsequent cases Eisuke made several blunders which would 'incidentally' contribute to the solution of the relevant case. \
 \
 Eisuke is a person with extremely bad luck. He's constantly bumping into or falling over something. However, his clumsiness belies a sharp intellect and keen talent for observation: With only few clues to work with, he was able to track down his vanished sister to the Haido Central Hospital, where the FBI was keeping her under guard, and even penetrate the facility to confront Mizunashi Rena - who really was his sister Hondou Hidemi - before he was discovered by Conan. He figured out that Shinichi and Conan were the same person before even meeting Conan and managed to force to the truth out of him later.\
 \
 In time, Conan found out that Eisuke was indeed related to Mizunashi. He had come to Tokyo looking for clues of his sister's whereabouts, sparked by him seeing her working as a newscaster by happenstance. He learned the truth from Conan, Hidemi and Akai Shuuichi that his sister, as well as his late father, were working for the CIA against the Black Organization. \
 \
 Following this revelation, he was offered a place in the Witness Protection Program, which he refused, though he decided to follow in his family's footsteps by joining the CIA one day. Alone with Conan, he also confessed that he had fallen in love with Ran and wished to take her with him to America. When Conan protested, Eisuke laughed out loud, stating that Conan's reaction was the final confirmation he had needed: that Conan was really Kudou Shinichi, and that in fact he was responsible for the \"Sleeping Kogoro's success.\" With this revelation, he asked Conan/Shinichi to take good care of Ran in his stead, thus promising to keep his secret.\

Having seen him in action, she has come to trust Conan and his judgment implicitly. Among the members of the Black Organization though, she appears to be cold and obedient to her superiors, but she acts a bit more merciful than the others, causing Gin to get suspicious of her at times. \

Although she does not like Mouri's attitude and personality (especially his drinking and nanpa habits), she still deeply loves and cares for him, often testing him to see if he still cares about her as well. \
 Eri and Mouri, like Shinichi and Ran and Heiji and Kazuha, had been best friends since childhood, falling in love in their teens. Ten years before the Detective Conan storyline starts, however, Mouri and Eri separated and took different paths in their lives. After seperating, Eri focused full time on her duties as a lawyer and has since become a highly respected (and feared) member of her profession.\
 \
 Eri is considered incredibly attractive. Various men of different ages have pined for her, but she always turns them down, mostly due to her feelings for Mouri. She and Yukiko were considered the two most beautiful girls at Teitan High School back when they were students. However, even though the result ended in a tie, the two remained very close friends, often letting little Shinichi and Ran play together and have playdates. Shinichi remembers often how Eri would give him a big scolding for starting trouble.\
 \
 Eri's personality suits her occupation as a lawyer. She is often very questioning, and gets herself involved in the investigation of cases along with Mouri, much to his chagrin. She has a cat, a Russian Blue named \"Goro,\" whom she cares for very deeply. Eri is also very close friends with her secretary, Kuriyama Midori.\
 \
 Eri is highly intelligent and has a sharp eye for details, and is also a skilled judoka, taught by Mouri himself. She has proven on more than one occasion that she can lend a big helping hand in cases, and her deductions are almost always accurate. Ran often goes to Eri for advice, especially on Ran's relationship with Shinichi. Eri has often half jokingly said that her best advice for Ran is to never get involved with a detective.\

 Yuusaku was already noted for his sharp intellect and deductive abilities at a young age. He met Inspector Megure and became a good friend and valuable adviser to him in solving very difficult cases. While he often assisted the police, Yuusaku's primary aspiration was that of a writer. Quickly attracting acclaim in his early twenties as a young novelist, he encountered the girl whom he resolved to marry: Fujimine Yukiko, an already famed and beautiful actress. While taking her out in an expensive restaurant to make his proposal, he was involved in a murder case which he solved brilliantly, and right afterward proposed to a startled Yukiko - which she accepted. (Twenty years later, his son Shinichi would become involved in a follow-up of the exact same case, but unlike Yuusaku he wouldn't be able to profess his feelings to his own love.)\
 \
 Yuusaku possesses a very sharp intellect and observation skills, traits which his son inherited, though Yuusaku's own abilities remain more well-honed. He demonstrates in multiple cases an ability to operate one step ahead of both Shinichi and criminals, but he chooses to not get involved unless Conan appears unable solve the case alone in time to save the intended victim. His success as a novelist is to a large part based on his keen understanding of the criminal mind, as his most famous recurring character is a criminal. While he is an excellent author, he will occasionally blow off his editors in order to do other things, such as travel with Yukiko. \
 \
 He is very laid back and calm, never seen to lose his temper. Some might think him too laid back, as he often took his son to crime scenes before Shinichi was eleven, and showed no concern over six-year-old Shinichi dragging Ran and Agasa into a potentially dangerous area of town to investigate a code. The only time he has been shown to be caught off-guard or stressed by a situation is after the false kidnapping, when Shinichi alerts Yuusaku's editors to his location and they force him to make up for missing his deadlines. His less tolerable personality traits include a certain cockiness and a very bad touch at making humor.\

She was once a famous actress, but retired after marrying Yuusaku. She was also close friends with fellow actress, Sharon Vineyard, both being excellent masters of disguise.  \
 Despite her then-tender years as a student at Teitan High, Yukiko had a prospectively prosperous future in the film industry. Thus it came as a major surprise to the world when, practically out of the blue, she married Kudou Yuusaku and retired from acting. She still retains good contacts in the acting and film industry, however, and has since become known as the \"Night Baroness\" (named after one of her husband's characters) after babbling out some clues provided by Yuusaku on a live television show which helped solve a criminal case.\
 \
 During her acting years, Yukiko went to a famous stage magician and disguise artist to learn the finer arts of disguise for a role she was preparing to play. There she met another actress who would become one of her closest friends, Sharon Vineyard. Until Sharon's (supposed) death, the two women stayed in touch, and Yukiko even attended her funeral, but her appearance was overshadowed by a small scandal involving Sharon's 'daughter', Chris Vineyard. Yukiko has since learned from her son about Chris/Sharon's secret life, a revelation which troubles her deeply. She has since confronted her former friend with her knowledge, partially to know for sure, but also to save the life of Haibara Ai, who was being threatened by the Black Organization.\
 \
 Despite her adult age, Yukiko still behaves like a teenager. She is bubbly, overconfident and attention-seeking, and prefers to stand in the lime-light (literally) whenever possible. She can be prone to jealousy over Yuusaku's occasionally flirtatious behavior, and can demonstrate impulsive tendencies. She is an extremely reckless driver and very sensitive about her age: whenever her son dares to call her \"oba-san\", she sets up such a furious face that Conan must quickly correct himself by calling her \"onee-san\".\

 The Phantom Thief Kid or The Magician Under the Moonlight (Kaito Kid) is a world-renowned thief who steals treasures and gems. He is sometimes known as Kaito Kid or \"International Criminal 1412.\"\
 \
 Despite the fact that Shinichi (Conan) does not care much about investigating thefts, Kid can be considered his archnemesis, as he is the one criminal (beside some members of the Black O) he can not seem to catch.\
 \
 Curiously, Kaito discovers Conan's true identity (non-canon, movies only), but keeps his secret, and sometimes Conan can even count on Kid's help to solve some of his cases; however, not even Kudo Shinichi knows about Kid's true identity.\
 \
 Throughout the story, Kaito Kid and Conan have crossed paths but he has always managed to escape from Conan's clutches by his special skills.\
 \
 Kaito is son of the magician, Touichi Kuroba, and apparently knew Shinichi's mother. Touichi Kuroba also made clues for Shinichi and Ran, who were in first grade. (From Vol.55)\

He noticed Sonoko cheering on her friend Ran during a martial arts tournament, and became interested in her. \
 Some time later, he worked in his family's inn as a waiter, where he encountered Sonoko again, this time in company of Ran and Conan. Soon, however, Sonoko was stalked by a crazed serial killer who suspected her of having taken a picture of him at his latest murder (which she hadn't) and therefore wanted to both silence her as a potential witness and kill her because he hated brown headed girls in general. Makoto saved her just in the nick of time, earning her affection, but his constant participation in martial arts competitions and a studying period overseas prevented them from seeing each other often enough. Sonoko always does her best to maintain contact with him, though, including sending him little trinkets and gifts that she makes herself, and Makoto has stayed loyal to her. He usually gets caught up in one of Sonoko's silly romantic schemes. His fighting skills have proven to be incredibly handy for Conan, having saved Conan, Sonoko, and Ran from being in dangerous peril many times. \
 \
 As a master martial artist, Makoto is usually cool and collected, especially in crisis situations, and also a keen observer. The only thing which does throw him off is his affection for Sonoko, for whom he will go great lengths, even forsake an important tournament just to meet her. However, Makoto's bashfulness around her, his dedication to his fighting skills and some competitive impulse keep him jumping from one obligation to the other, so their relationship is rendered a bit difficult. But at a point, Sonoko introduces Makoto to her parents and they eventually approve of him. \
 \
 Makoto is depicted as one of the most powerful teenage martial artists throughout the whole series. In reference to his incredible ability, he is nicknamed the \"Prince of Kicks\". He has acquired championships in some international Karate tournaments. Makoto also had a 400 win streak from matches around the world that was broken only when he skipped a tournament to be introduced to Sonoko's parents and lost by default.\

He is almost always there on the scene when a murder occurs, always interviewing the suspects, and acting as the commanding officer of the group of police he brings along with him, among them Takagi Wataru, Satou Miwako, Shiratori Ninzaburou and Chiba. \
 Megure is a capable veteran officer who cares much for his underlings, but he is prone to occasional shouting fits whenever something does not go right or when his temper gets the better of him. He also has little patience for fools, but tends to be a bit too conservative, limiting his ability for flexible thinking.\
 \
 Shortly after Megure had come to the police force, he was involved in a case in which he would meet his future wife, Midori. As a result of the case, he has taken to wearing a hat in public in order to hide a scar which he gained and his own self-consciousness about how he came to his marriage. Megure was also a good friend of star detective story novelist Kudou Yuusaku, and would in the past consult him about one case or another. On many such occasions, Yuusaku would take his son Shinichi with him, who would pick up his father's investigative skills and eventually become a detective in his own right.\
 \
 After Shinichi solved their first mutual case for him, he has regularly consulted him in difficult cases and considered him a great help. In stark contrast to this, he tends not to think much of Conan and the Detective Boys, usually thinking of them as a nuisance until they solve the ongoing case for him. Likewise, from their common police days, he has no high regard for Kogorou, and he thinks that he may actually be under some kind of jinx, since wherever Kogoro shows up, there is always some murder case nearby (a fact which actually conforms to Conan, which in later cases he seems to have realized).\
 \
 In some anime originals, Megure has the habit of trying to tell the culprit about the morals of doing wrong, which he rarely does in the manga series. \

Midori was also a member of a girl gang, and her best friend ended up the first fatality, so since the culprit had not been caught after a while she decided to help apprehend the killer and volunteered to act as a decoy. There was an apparent shortage of police able to help her, and Midori was extremely stubborn and insisted to be alone; under orders of Commisioner Matsumoto, she was teamed up with Juzo Megure, then still a junior police officer. \
 Unfortunately, the car runner surprised and hit them both. Megure tried to pull Midori out of danger, but they were still harmed; fortunately, Megure was able to remember the car's license number, and the perpetrator was soon arrested. Midori was gravely injured in the accident, but recovered with only a scar on her forehead to show for her ordeal, and some time afterwards she married Megure out of gratitude. In a strange switch of role, she is perhaps the only person who has managed to temper his impulsive surges, a role her husband feels a bit bashful about.\
 \
 Midori has also appeared, in an unseen role, as a witness to a crime and had to be taken to the station for questioning, as well as making a cameo appearance during the White Day Murder Case.\
 \
 She is also mentioned by Takagi in episode 146. She was inside the bank where the robbery happened and was wounded by the criminals who pushed her around. Because of that, Takagi says, Inspector Megure is taking that case very seriously. \

Koumei cherishes the book, keeping it in the glove compartment of his car, as the author was a friend of his who died. He was originally a high ranking inspector in Nagano, until he abadoned his job briefly to try and find Yamato when he was left for dead in the snow during a case. After Koumei found the suspect, and helped save Yamato, he was downgraded as an inspector in a local force in Nagano. Later it is revealed that he has effectively returned to the main headquarters. \
 \
 Komei is generally shown to be calm and well-mannered, in contrast to the quick-tempered Yamato. According to Yamato, Komei tends to ignore others completely while investigating, and sometimes goes out of his jurisdiction to try and solve a case. He will even put his life on the line if he has to. The rivalry between Yamato and Koumei is mostly a friendly one, in which they see who can solve the case first, and Yamato has tried to get Koumei back onto the regular force. Also, Yamato has been willing to go into a burning building to save his life. \

While he may kill without hesitation, he does it mostly out of fear and to regain his freedom.

 Yoko first met Conan, Mouri and Ran when she asked for Mouri's help in apprehending a stalker who had even penetrated her apartment (and of course, Mouri would not hesitate to take the case). But in the apartment they found an unknown man impaled upon a knife, turning this case into a murder investigation. Soon, however, Conan figured out that the 'victim' had actually committed suicide: The man was Fujie Akiyoshi, Yoko's old boyfriend who still loved her. Due to a fatal misunderstanding, however, Fujie fell into despair and plunged himself on to the knife, making it appear as if he had been murdered in order to take revenge on Yoko. Luckily, Conan found out the truth before damage could be inflicted on Yoko's career.\

 She was once part of an elite karuta association called Nagoro-kai. She was the greatest student of the group's founder, Nagoro Shikao. However, after the group was disbanded she joined another association called the Satsuki-kai.\

 Momiji appears to be an extremely competent detective, as she saw through a trick merely based on a sound she heard in a phone call with her butler, Muga Iori, before Conan, Heiji or Bourbon did. Later, Muga says that her deduction was great as usual, implying that she regularly solves cases and also says that Heiji's great deductive skill was to be expected from the person that Momiji chose as her partner.\

 Momiji is involved in the plot of Movie 21 which will center around Heiji and Kazuha's romance. She is shown crying in the movie artwork. The trailer of the movie shows her in an uta-karuta tournament and introducing herself as \"Heiji's fianc&eacute;\", plus there's a picture of her and Heiji's younger selves making a pinky swear.\

At first, Shiratori only appeared in movie roles, playing key roles in the first three Detective Conan movies. At some point, Shiratori later became a full-fledged inspector. \
 As a child, Shiratori studied diligently to one day become a lawyer, and had even memorized some laws by heart. One day, he witnessed a young girl confronting two juveniles trying to steal mangas from a bookstore. To thank him for helping her out, the girl bought him a drink and made a sakura petal pattern from the straw wrapper, saying the sakura was the symbol of courage for the Japanese police (due to the distinct form of the Japanese police badge). It was because of this incident that Shiratori decided to become a cop rather than a lawyer.\
 \
 Shiratori later joined the Tokyo Metropolian Police Department and worked alongside Inspector Megure, often acting as an extra officer or pair of eyes, though he later became an inspector of his own. When Satou Miwako joined the department, Shiratori believed that he had found his childhood love again, and as a result both he and his younger colleague Takagi considered each other rivals for Satou's affections. Shiratori would often try to show off in front of Takagi by asking Satou on a date, but she always rejected him, much to his dismay. However, he has since come to date Kobayashi Sumiko, whom he finally discovered to be his true love. \
 \
 As a cop, Shiratori is fairly average. He is calmer on the case than Takagi or Satou. Shiratori, like Satou and Takagi, believes that Conan has a lot of intelligence for a boy his age, but unlike Takagi and Satou, he usually tends to care not much for Conan's opinion. He often feels that Conan gets in the way, though Conan always proves otherwise. However, unlike Kogorou, Shiratori will take notice and suspect something if Conan points something quite interesting. Shiratori's attitude can appear cocky when battling for Satou's affections, but otherwise he appears more modest, as in the first Detective Conan movies or when he is with is now girlfriend Kobayashi Sensei.\

Although Ran knows that Sonoko has a lot of money, she always makes sure that money never gets involved in thier friendship, not going to ski vacations with Sonoko because she doesn't have the money, when she knows that Sonoko would pay for her to go. This, along with other things, has helped strengthen the bond between both Ran and Sonoko. \
 \
 Before she began dating Kyougoku Makoto, Sonoko displayed the typical girl her age, acting very boy-crazy, and often mostly thinking about trying to snag the \"perfect boy.\" She would often act sad because she couldn't get a boyfriend, using all necessary means to try and get one. She often dressed in clothes meant to attract boys, and would try to sweet talk her way into being with a boy, by making him chocolates, trying to impress a boy while wearing a bikini, or going to various events that young guys were going to attend. Ran, in the meanwhile, would always be the one to unwillingly attract the boys, which would cause jealousy in Sonoko. However, this all changed when Sonoko met and began dating Makoto.... well, not quite. She still flirts with boy sometimes, but in the end it's still Makoto that she likes.\

 But when Conan overhears Tequila on a payphone, he hears him speaking to Vodka and that he is a member of the Black Organization. He then attaches a tracer to the sole of Tequila's shoe. Tequila then walks into one of the hotel's bathrooms as Conan listens in, only to see the bathroom explode.\

 At one time in their youth, Heiji had had the unfortunate idea of locking themselves together with a set of old handcuffs which had no key to unlock it; as a result they involuntarily had to spend time together even on some rather intimate occasions (i.e., bathroom visits) before the cuffs could be removed. As a reminder of this 'closeness' and for good luck, Kazuha fashioned two identical lucky charms, each incorporating a chain link from the cuffs, which she and Heiji have been wearing ever since. At some later point, Kazuha added a picture of Heiji into her own charm pouch.\
 \
 Kazuha has a hot temper and can be highly critical of people around her. She has been hinted to have a high level of intelligence, as she was able to deduce a dying message in an episode even more quickly than either Ran or Kogoro could (albeit with slight help from Heiji). Moreover, she is highly confrontational and unafraid to let others know of her dislike, even showed no hesitation or concern confronting Heiji in men's restroom. This trait leads to frequent shouting matches with Heiji, but it also allowed her and Ran to forge a strong friendship.\
 \
 She also has a marked belief in spirits, good-luck charms, and other superstitions. Right from her first experience, she displayed her belief in the importance of hers and Heiji's charm, which Kazuha made to protect her and Heiji from harm. And indeed, during the same case, Heiji lent Conan his charm, and the metal inside it stopped a knife blade that would have killed Conan. On subsequent cases, Kazuha is quick to attribute mysterious shadows and strange events to ghosts and other malignant spirits, which usually sends Ran into a panic as well, though she herself does not possess a morbid fear of ghosts as much as Ran does.\

One day, the popular village policeman and kyujitsu master Kuroto Kai died under mysterious circumstances, prompting Uehara and Yamato, who had joined the police force following his example, to investigate the case.  \
 When Yamato was critically injured and believed lost in an unrelated case (thus gaining him his damaged leg and his trademark scarred eye), Uehara decided to carry on the investigation by herself, quitting the police force and marrying into one of the families she suspected of having murdered Kai.\
 \
 Despite spending a year in the household, the case was resolved only when another string of mysterious murders occurred (with her husband winding up as the first victim) and Conan and Heiji were called up to solve them. Soon after the resolution of the case, Uehara rejoined the police force.\
 \
 Uehara is a friendly and considerate person, which offsets Yamato's harsh appearance and behavior, complementing the two so different personalities. It is frequently hinted by her behavior that she is in love with him, but his professionalism has as yet prevented any serious personal engagement, although Yamato himself seems not reluctant to it.\

But, although she follows orders from the boss and Gin when he is charge of missions, she often acts according to her own agenda and whims, even when it runs contrary to the Black Organization's best interests, being secretive and manipulative, even towards other Organization members. Vermouth is confident in her abilities, is very bold, and an expert at manipulating situations to her advantage: traits which allow her to single-handedly weave complex plots and take the upper hand even while she is being monitored by enemies. She is intelligent and insightful, but her personality is contradictory at times. On one hand, she is a cruel and ruthless agent who will blackmail an unwilling man to commit murder by threatening him and his family just to provide a distraction and happily tell an FBI agent she should smile because she will see her dead father again in heaven. On the other hand, she risks her life several times to protect Conan, Ran, and Kogoro, and her friendly behavior while in disguise as Tomoaki Araide left the real Araide wondering if Vermouth is really a bad person.  \
 In the past, under the name Sharon Vineyard, Vermouth was friends with Yukiko Kudo back when they were acting together, but was even then secretly a member of the Black Organization. It is unknown for exactly how long she has been a member, but it is known that she had been secretly living at least two lives through the art of disguise: that of herself and her supposed daughter, Chris Vineyard. After staging Sharon Vineyard's death, she now lives as Chris and continues to serve the Black Organization. At one point, some twenty years ago, she killed the parents of a little girl who would become the FBI agent Jodie Starling, one of her most bitter enemies.\
 \
 Vermouth is the boss&rsquo;s favorite which grants her some independence. And also appears not to age or have de-aged over a period of twenty years between when she killed Jodie's parents and her current appearance.\
 \
 She has great personal interest in Conan, constantly calling him \"Silver Bullet\". Since it has been revealed that she knows about Ai and Kudo's reversion to their child forms, she seems to know the shrinking effect the drug can have, but for reasons yet unrevealed keeps this knowledge secret from the rest of the Organization.\

Yamato lost his left eye in a snow avalanche and now has an X-shaped scar in its place. This same avalanche caused severe and permanent damage to his left leg, forcing him to use a forearm crutch to walk around.  \
 Yamato grew up in a small Nagano village with Uehara. Like most people from the village, he greatly admired police officer and town hero Kai Kuroto, who inspired him and Uehara to join the police. One year before the Fuurinkazan Case, Yamato chased a parole jumper he believed to be involved with Kai's mysterious death into a mountain, where he got caught in the avalanche that took his left eye and leg. He was missing and believed dead for several days until school friend Morofushi \"Koumei\" Taka'aki, also a police inspector, went against orders to track down the criminal and find Yamato. After recovering, he returned to the force and resumed working on solving Kai's death.\
 \
 In contrast to other police inspectors like Megure, Yokomizo, and Yamamura, Yamato is shown to be very serious and hard-boiled. He is often short-tempered and has been known to yell at and intimidate suspects. This aspect of his personality causes him to become quite visibly annoyed with Kogorou's ignorance and Yamamura's goofiness. Still, he does have softer spots, though he does not show them often, and there are hints that he is both aware and accepting of Uehara's affection toward him. With the aid of Conan and Heiji the case was finally resolved, and soon afterwards Uehara rejoined the police force as his partner.\
 \
 Yamato does have a petty rivalry with fellow police detective Koumei, often competing with him to see who can solve a case first. Despite this, they remain very close friends, and Yamato was even willing to run into a burning mansion to save him at one point. Yamato is also aware of Conan's intelligence and is one of few characters who treats him like an adult and equal.\

 Yokomizo is a capable police officer, though with one odious personal habit: he tends to get his face right into a suspect's face, study them closely, and scream into their face when he believes he is onto something, a habit which even he believes is a little embarrassing. Another trait of his is to speak really loudly when deeply involved in an investigation. His loud voice has received many complaints from suspects.\

One day, while at an outing with childhood friend Ran Mouri, Shinichi bears witness to a suspicious transaction between two men and is caught. As a result, he is forced to ingest a poison that is supposed to kill him, but unexpectedly shrinks his body to the size of a grade-schooler instead. Now believed to be dead, Shinichi takes up the alias of Conan Edogawa (a compound of the names of the famous mystery authors Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa) in order to hide his identity and begins his new life as a seven-year-old living with Ran and her private detective father. Detective Conan follows Conan as he continues to solve murder cases, all while slowly working toward exposing the men who shrunk him and eventually restoring his body. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
