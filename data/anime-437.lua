    Title: Perfect Blue\
Novel, Anime: Perfect Blue was originally a novel written by Yoshikazu Takeuchi.  When, I'm not really sure; there's not a lot of information about it.  \
The movie itself was done by Oniro, directed by Satoshi Kon, and was released in 1997. \
Story: The story is centered around Mima Kirigoe, the lead member of a pop trio who's decided to go solo as an actress.  Her small recurring role in a direct-to-video series ends up turning into a big break, but the part and a subsequent photo shoot involves... compromising situations, to say the least. On top of all this, she's\
          \
        got a stalker that knows every intimate detail about her life and is posting it on the Internet.  And then the murders start, and her sanity starts fraying...\
This film was Satoshi Kon's big break, and you know why when you watch it.  The line between reality and fantasy blurs more and more as the film goes on, and you wonder if it's either all in her head, part of the direct-to-video series, or for real.  And you will be scared.  I was watching this in broad daylight in my dorm on move-in day for the returning students, and I was still scared out of my wits.  And the plot twists.  My god, the plot twists.  In general, the plot is going to blow you out of the water.\
As for faithfulness to the original, I've found tidbits that said that Kon didn't think that the original novel would make a good film, and so he asked permission from Takeuchi to change things.  He got the permission, so long as the original story concepts were intact.  For those who were looking for a faithful adaptation, there is a live-action film called Perfect Blue: Yume Nara Samete that was released in 2002 and directed by Toshiki Sato. \
You can tell how old the film is, though, when the main character is trying to figure out how to use a computer/the Intarnet.  xD\
WARNING: There is rape, there is detailed nudity, there is very graphic violence, and lots and lots of blood.  I'm not kidding when I say that you should only be watching this if you're over 17.  Kiddies, and those who are squeamish, stay far away from this movie.\
Art: This film was done back in '97, so yeah, the style's going to look a bit dated.  But when you compare the animation with other shows that were airing about the same time (Pokemon, Sailor Moon StarS, to name a few), it doesn't seem to be quite as good as it possibly could be.  The main reason for that was that during production, the Kobe earthquake hit the production studio (Madhouse), and the film's budget was reduced from one for a live-action movie to that of an OVA.  Not the greatest art out there during the time, but given the situation that they had to work with, it's still pretty decent.\
Music: The pop numbers that Mima's trio does (CHAM!) are pretty catchy.  And the other music that's played only heightens the suspense.  Pretty good, overall.\
Seiyuu: As usual, no problems here.  Mima's seiyuu is outstanding (she later went on to play Tomoyo in Cardcaptor Sakura, Ceres in Ceres: Celestial Legend, and Akane in My-HiME (Higurashi), My-Otome and My-Otome Zwei (Soir)).\
Dub: N/A, didn't watch it.\
Length: I honestly don't know what more they could've done with this film; the film wraps up at close to an hour and a half.  (Actually, knowing Kon, maybe I don't want to know.) And it seems just right, because of the fast pace that it clips along at, while still managing to make sure that everything that the audience needs to understand is included. \
Overall: An amazing, if not perfectly animated, psychological thriller that will have you wondering just what's real here and clinging to your nearest cuddly.\

    Strap in for a roller coaster ride through the human mind.\
As always, my reviews are spoiler free.\
You know you have done something right when someone can completely associate your name with a genre.  For Satoshi Kon, that genre is Psychological Thriller (or mindf**k, if you prefer).  All his works (perhaps with the exception of Tokyo Godfathers, which is still fantastic) explore this genre differently, some deeper than others, but from Paranoia Agent to Millennium Actress he clearly shows his abilities as a director.  Of all his works, I think his first, Perfect Blue, is my favorite.  \
Story - 10/10\
Our story begins\
          \
        with Kirigoe Mima, a member of a pop idol group, deciding to give up her singing career for a future as an actress.  This decision leads to a string of events that will change her life forever, as well those around her.  What begins with sinister phone calls and faxes becomes a paranoid fight for her life with a stalker; a stalker with a warped view of reality to say the least.  Mima's career as an actor is not as glamorous as she expected either, leading to outrage among her fans and incredible stress for her manager and friend, Hidaka Rumi.  As mysterious acts of violence are committed around her, Mima's view of reality begins to change.\
The story explores a number of topics that few other works in the medium discuss, such as the loss of innocence and the perception of reality.  It tackles these tough subjects without forcing them upon the viewer, as they are slowly immersed into the twisted world of Mima's life.  \
As much as I would love to continue to praising the story, I cannot bring myself to do it.  It is something that must be experienced and not spoiled.  And that ending... Wow.\
Animation - 8/10\
Released in 1997, this movie will of course look dated when compared to the work of today.  When it is compared to other works of the time, however, it stands out with great fluidity.  Some of the artistic choices are a bit strange, especially the character designs, but there is nothing that will detract from the experience, especially if one manages to acquire a Blu-ray release.  \
One outstanding factor is the cinematography.  The angle of scenes being changed gives a certain amount of depth of vision most other series cannot come close to matching, even today.\
I will be giving animation an 8/10, keeping in mind that it should be compared with other anime produced in the 90s.  \
Sound - 7/10\
The soundtrack is haunting and disorienting.  Much like that of well made horror movies, a feeling of suspense can be gradually built and released, or suddenly come to a climax.  However, there is nothing worthy in and of itself, and the songs CHAM!, Mima's idol group, sings are grating on the ears at best.\
Character - 10/10\
Mima is developed very extensively throughout the movie, as she is the sole protagonist.  Personally, I developed a great attachment to her throughout the movie, sharing her fear, depression, and confusion.  She makes a fantastic protagonist, and as I mentioned above, wonderfully illustrates the theme of loss of innocence.  \
The supporting cast does well, with Rumi and her stalker being the main side characters.  Rumi is developed very well herself, especially in the later half of the series as the story is tied together.  The stalker, while far less explored, still has his motivations clearly explained and the viewer gets a fantastic look into a deranged mind.\
Overall, it has one of the best protagonists I have ever seen, and a strong supporting cast.\
Enjoyment - 10/10\
If you are a fan of suspense, mystery, drama, thrillers... you will love this.  Perfect Blue appeals to so many psychological elements and has such an intricate setup that it can be watched again and again, noticing new things each time.  The second watch can be even better with than the first; once you know the end, you can trace the story backwards to the origin.  \
I would not recommend this to fans of mindless action, comedy, or SOL.  It is not by any means a \"light watch.\"  But if you are willing to sit back and let it totally absorb you, I can't possibly think of a better way to spend your time.\
Other Thoughts\
This movie contains fully uncensored nudity and graphic sexual scenes.  There is a significant amount of violence as well, but it is not too gory.  I would still strongly advise against younger viewers watching this.\
If you enjoyed this movie, you should immediately acquire and watch everything that Satoshi Kon ever directed.  I don't think you will be disappointed.\
I give this movie a 9/10, with the only improvements I could wish for would be a slightly better soundtrack and a fresh coat of animation (give it to ufotable, they would be perfect).\
Thanks for reading.\

    Sitting alone in the dark watching someone tell the day you had forgotten. You just might lose your mind.\
Thinking about who you are and why you are this person may often cause your thoughts to clash amongst one another. This is strongly shown in the main character Mima Kirigoe. The story is truly some of the best writing I’ve ever seen. Its a mix of linear progression and short time jumps. This enhances the disarray shown in Mima. All of the scenes show believable emotion on what a character might do faced with the situation. The story is very unique in the way it ties\
          \
        together what is a dream and what is reality. Mima aspiring to be an actor allows this story to use clever writing to really add mystery and delusion while maintaing truth.  The pacing is flawless. When it begins to steamroll watching for the first time you will be asking what the hell is going on a lot. It can be a very exciting show with thought provoking themes. It is accompanied by some less then easy to watch moments. They add to the emotional strain on Mima pulling her mind apart but may not be watchable by everyone. This is a masterpiece of complex emotional thoughts and detailed writing, used in the telling of the story which ties together everything in the end.\
The art shows beautiful symbolism. Tones are darkened slightly to add an extra layer of mystery an unease. It has a realistic world and character design to it. Each character’s look matches their personality extremely well. The eyes on the creeper characters give a twisted feeling to them. Mima switches from upbeat and happy to paranoid or depressed effortlessly. Its never out of place for the scene in the story. Watching the Art techniques used to portray confusion in Mima’s mind, believing a glass door isn’t there, or the splash a puddle makes (or doesn’t) is the necessary details that make this movie wonderful. The heavy blurs mixing dream and reality the quick transitions tying plot together with story progression while maintaing illusion is executed flawlessly in Perfect Blue.\
The soundtrack fits the story at every scene. Its eerie and frighting when it needs to be an able to switch immediately to a lighter mood with the Pop songs without totally losing the emotion from before. The sound overall from camera flashes to violent climaxes along with all of the voice acting (Viewed Subbed Version) is amazing. I personally enjoyed the distorting of one of the \"CHAM!\" songs to accompany a scene that otherwise would feel out of place. This allowed for the story to mix emotions that wouldn’t be seen together otherwise. It was a nice trick further showing the brilliant writing shown throughout both the Art and Sound. \
I want to be very careful on how I explain the characters as their development is truly at the core of the story. All the supporting characters fit their role in the story exceptionally well. The choices and decision made are believable. They have realistic ideas and goals shown in the story that define the decisions they make. The characters have common afflictions which relates them to one another in multiple ways. The devoplment of Mima is shockingly beautiful to say the least. I felt I could understand some of the feelings she had in choosing to become a different person and the difficulty in leaving part of your life behind. All of the characters feel real even just the filling ones talking about the gossip revolving around Mima’s life. \
This is a truly unique story with a beautifully integrate plot, a perfectly toned art style, exceptionally well scored soundtrack, and believable an interesting characters. The story is gritty and bold as well as exciting and impassioned. If you are looking for a show that will get your mind thinking and are able to handle a few disheartening scenes. You will lose your thoughts within the chaos of perfection that is Perfect Blue.\

    Perfect Blue centers around a small pop star's transition into the film business.  Her life is turned upside down by her new, less innocent work, a stalker, and several murders that occur around her.  Much like Millennium Actress and Paprika, this is another Satoshi Kon film that blurs the lines between reality and delusion, only to a more suspenseful effect in Perfect Blue.  Mima, the ex-pop star turned actress is filming a TV murder drama throughout most of the movie that eerily mirrors the murders that are occurring around her.  It is often unclear if a scene is playing out on\
          \
        the set or in the real world.  Then there's the nagging question throughout of whether the entire scenario isn't a schizophrenic delusion of a psychotic killer.\
The stalker and the murders are suspense staples, and unnerving enough in and of themselves.  The religious obsession of stalkers is inherently freaky, as are psychotic and pathological murders.  The layer that Kon's style adds is the anxiety the viewer feels each time Mima wakes up from a horrendous dream or in each filmed scene of the TV drama where the already unstable established reality becomes even more fragile when we question if perhaps the supposedly filmed rape scenes or murder scenes are the truth; if perhaps the seemingly sweet and innocent Mima doesn't hide a psychopath behind a web of delusions.  The film doesn't try to establish a twisted empathy with the killer in question the way many suspense novels would.  Most of the important characters are quite simply insane.  The lack of awareness they have for their own pathology, along with the constant ambiguity in the borders between fantasy and reality is what builds and holds the suspense.\
Satoshi Kon has always done beautiful running animation, but nowhere is it more appreciated than in Perfect Blue.  The way the characters stumble a little every now and then, or run full sprint into a wall and push off to round a corner rather than just slowing down and making a turn, coupled with spectacular voice performances by the cast, most notably when they're screaming for help or begging for forgiveness, does wonders at conveying the sheer terror these characters are experiencing during the more violent scenes.  From eye stabbing to rape, some of these scenes seem like they're too disgusting to watch, and there was always a part of me that wanted to turn away, but the fear bleeds through the screen in such a way that I found my eyes glued, and myself actually praying for the characters' safety.  In this sense, even though Perfect Blue doesn't establish the easiest characters to empathize with, the shockingly realistic way they convey horror (relative to other Anime at the very least) awakens the primal concern we have for someone in distress.\
The twist at the end is skin crawlingly creepy, and at a happy medium between predictable and out of the blue.  It's hinted at a few times throughout the film, but with all the reality bending and psychotic delusions going on, it certainly isn't the only outcome I suspected.  Too bad it so clearly distinguishes the previously hazy borders between what is real and what isn't.  Such an ambiguous movie should retain a little bit of its ambiguity to the end, but instead the climax brings reality down fast and hard.  Its clarity and convenience makes it slightly unsatisfying.\
There's no arguing that the climax is spectacular.  The whole movie makes beautiful use of tension without any gimmicky camera angles that zoom in on demented, boggling eyes or some other such junk that many psychothriller anime titles use to create unease when the scenario itself isn't enough to accomplish it.  Perfect Blue is creepiness in its purest form.\

    “Excuse me… Who are you?”\
Perspective. Works of fiction such as TV and film are all about perspective. Fiction in general is the classification of imaginative stories, these stories having the ability to convey themes to give stories a deeper meaning. But with TV and film, these stories are presented visually, allowing for a whole new experience and perspective on a story. The perspective provides new ways to justify character actions, events and even reality itself, questioning if what is being show is, in fact, real. This is a movie that focuses on the latter specifically. A movie that not only shows someone losing control over\
          \
        what is real and what is not, but also a movie that lets viewers see the journey to madness first-hand. This is Perfect Blue: a movie that is anything but what the title seems.\
Perfect Blue is a psychological thriller anime film based on the novel of the same name, made in 1997 by Studio Madhouse and was the directorial debut of Satoshi Kon; the genius mind behind other great animated works such as Paranoia Agent and Millennium Actress. The film follows Mima Kirigoe, a singer for J-pop idol group CHAM! who decides to leave the group after moderate success and financial limitations to pursue a more profitable career as an actress, much to the dismay of her fans and management. She manages to land a role in a crime drama, however at the same time she starts receiving anonymous threats and even finds a blog called ‘Mima’s Room’ that details her life in intimate detail without her knowledge. This is soon followed with a chain of mysterious murders taking place to the people around her, all while she is being stalked by an obsessed fan called “Me-Mania” and her very own pop idol self in the form of a ghost, haunting her and insisting that she return to singing. Throughout the film Mima questions her decisions as an actress and due to her experiences and events, loses her sense of reality. And all of this correlates to create this dark, enthralling mindfuck that will have you on the edge of your seat like no other.\
The story of Perfect Blue does take it’s time to get rolling as it has a rather simplistic setup whilst focusing on the inner turmoil Mima is facing. In other words, do not expect it to be epic from the get-go with action-packed scenes throughout. Perfect Blue is not a thriller in that sense. Rather, the thrills come from Mima’s disfigured perception of reality experienced between her personal life and the TV series she stars in, Double Bind. The film plays with this dilemma extremely well, blurring the lines of reality and psychosis to the point where viewers won’t even know what is really happening anymore. Some scenes with Mima in them were nicely acted and well-shot that at first looked real, only for the film to reveal that she was acting the entire time. Yet she is giving more emotion in these takes than any of her fellow actors, because these scenes reflect on her life. Later in the movie, we are given details of what is initially believed to be Mima’s life and mental health issue, then suddenly the camera pans out and the details were revealed to have been in the script read out by one of the actors in the show. There were so many times when I thought I understood what was happening, only for the film to trick me, to the point where you would think to just give up piecing together the puzzle of Perfect Blue until the end. However, the dichotomy between reality and fiction is weaved so well it compels viewers to continue on.\
There is no doubt that Perfect Blue is confusing, especially on first watch. But that is no flaw, it was made purposely to allow us to go through the same experiences that Mima does, and it only gets more intense as it goes on. Each scene is somehow more disturbing than the last, keeping everyone watching in suspense as the rather simplistic thriller in the beginning turns into a psychological nightmare towards the end. And as the scenes get more disturbing, so does the editing and overall cinematography. Satoshi Kon was a genius of editing, knowing exactly when to cut to a different scene for the maximum effect. The film transitions used here are as magnificent as you would expect; in several scenes, the narrative and music builds to its peak before suddenly cutting to the next scene. The film is very much made in the style that you would expect from an Alfred Hitchcock, only here it adds to the confusion of fact and fiction. It provokes viewers to think about the limitless outcomes of how the movie could end, but the movie knows this and continuously swerves the story around movie clichés. The movie even goes so far as to place scenes out of chronological order and some scenes cut before characters can finish their sentences. Everything was done to further put the viewer in Mima’s position; you feel and see first-hand what she is going through. With Perfect Blue, Kon was able to showcase his understanding of the human mind and his ability to further heighten these feelings of isolation and fear.\
As you can see, Perfect Blue is primarily concerned with the psychological breakdown of Mima as a result of her transition from a pop idol to an actress, but through this the film strive to find out who Mima is. Numerous times the film shows Mima as a timid person that does not have a strong sense of who she is, preferring to rely on those around her to define her identity. Even if the beginning the film defines her through the perspective of her fans, and from there it is her management that controls her image for their own wishes, going so far as to put her in a rape scene in order to get more eyes on the TV show. While the rape scene is staged, Mima is still traumatized by the experience. The film provides an authentic commentary on the exploitation of woman in the entertainment industry, especially in Japan’s case as Mima’s development shows change internally and externally, from the innocence pop idol perceived by fans of her former self to where she feels as though she needs to be sexually exploited if she is ever going to be able to advance her career, causing further damage to her psyche. These kinds of actions make you think that the price of fame may not be worth the cost of identity.\
Perfect Blue also tackles the issue of technology and how easy it is to create, maintain and lose control of one’s own public avatar. Before insanity takes over in full force, Mima finds an internet diary of sorts dedicated to detailing her experiences, feelings and life in general to even the most minute detail without Mima’s knowledge. While finding it humorous at first, her emotions quickly turn to fear as she figures out that she is being stalked, endangering her former sense of seclusion. She is never seen as a hero in the film, rather she is seen more realistically as a victim of lost privacy. Mima’s case becomes worse as the films goes on, with the site publishing false statements under the guise of Mima despite not reflecting her true feelings. Bear in mind that this film started production in 1994/1995, a time where stalking and the internet itself were barely understood, making the film prophetic in its use of the internet. Privacy is an increasing issue in society today, making the dilemmas faced in this film more relatable and realistic, and along with the unclear distinction of what she perceives to be real, makes this tale that much more terrifying.\
While Perfect Blue is a complex film, it does have an artistic side to it. There are several scenes throughout that while own their own look stunning, but with context signify Mima’s fall from grace and descent into madness. Some of these scenes were so well done that they have been recreated in live-action films like Requiem of a Dream and Black Swan. Despite the film’s title, the colour red is very symbolic as it represents Mima’s madness growing. As the movie goes on, red becomes more and more prominent, from brief items to completely encompassing Mima in some scenes, mirroring what happens in the narrative. Yet the colour never feels out of place in the film; if anything, it heightens the suspenseful nature that the film has. In contrast, white is used with the ghost of Mima’s mind, indicating the former innocence she once possessed in her pop idol career, back when she would have been considered too pure to go through with what is now expected of her as an actress. Reflections are also used prominently to not only foreshadow issues such as stalking and sexualisation, but as an effective way to explore the duality Mima faces throughout the film, further highlighting the identity crisis she faces. The brilliant imagery in Perfect Blue holds within it incredible thematic depth, hidden details and more, all while telling a confusing yet compelling story with seemingly unlimited replay value.\
The only glaring weak point that Perfect Blue has is in the sound, specifically the English dub. The cast and acting are both fine albeit some pronunciation issues here and there, but the script for the English version is weaker than its Japanese counterpart and it is apparent. Voice actors for the English dub were recorded one at a time and the depth of voice is off in some scenes, but overall it’s still a fine dub. The Japanese acting however the excellent all around, adding to the creepy and unsettling vibe the show already gives off. The soundtrack is varied, ranging from generic J-pop idol songs to the eerie themes that fit the tense atmosphere. There are even themes that change tone halfway through (for example, a J-pop tune that gets purposely distorted) in order to fit scenes that transition to Mima’s hallucinations, keeping the film unpredictable at every moment. It is complex, melancholic, surreal and beautiful all at the same time.\
Perfect Blue is an absolute masterpiece of a psychological movie that feels more real than what we wish to see. Satoshi Kon uses hallucinations, imagery and even a doppelganger within this multi-layered narrative to draw the audience into Mima’s world; a place where her identity and sense of reality is broken more and more as time goes on. The ending of the film revolves around how Mima answers the iconic question from the beginning of this review: \"Excuse me... Who are you?\". In that sense, Perfect Blue can be considered Mima’s coming of age story, where she began as a character defined by others, and over the course of the film loses everyone around her until she is all alone. In these kinds of moments, the only option left for Mima is to find herself. Nobody can help her through this; she is ultimately the only one who can truly find a place where she knows she belongs. And in the end, she does, but not in a way you would expect. The last scene shows Mima in a car underneath clear blue skies. She looks into the rear-view mirror; looking directly at the audience and smiles, then in cryptic fashion declares:\
“No, I’m the real thing”.\

STORY - Perfect Blue is a very loose novel adaptation that was originally intended to be (and eventually made into) a live action movie, and it's very clear that the story presented in the film would have been very fitting for a live action treatment.

        her in a role that becomes increasingly similar to her real life situation, and the stress of having to perform less-than-desirable roles coupled with a bizarre stalker-like website personality claiming to be her throws her world into chaos.\
The story itself has a very classic feel to it -- a person's insecurity and doubt after making a major life decision isn't anything groundbreaking, but it's an easy-to-relate to subject, and there are many ways to make that simple storyline interesting. Kon's expert storytelling and the incredible cinematics of Perfect Blue make it well worth watching. The camera angles and the way scenes are spliced together is incredible. The more Mima becomes uncertain of her world, the more the audience becomes unsure of what they're seeing. Was that last scene a dream or reality? When the scene repeats -- is the second version reality? Or is it a dream? Or were they both dreams? The ambiguity of what is and isn't can be frustrating at times, but in the end, the effectiveness of the storytelling outweighs any real need to know what was and wasn't.\
CHARACTER - Excellent. Mima's psychological descent is well-played. Her insecurity and uncertainty about her decisions and identity is easy to believe, so it's easy to sympathize with her -- always an important thing. This allows the resulting drama some leeway as far as realism goes, and you're able to take on a lot more without thinking that any of it is over-the-top or ridiculous. It's hard to elaborate too much on her ordeal without giving everything away, but yeah... Mima's character is great all around.\
The secondary characters are of mostly of the sort that play one specific role and that's it. This works well enough since the film is essentially about Mima's mental and emotional state, and that makes detailed exploration of other characters more or less pointless. Still, Me-Mania (the stalker) and Mima's managerial staff are very effective in that they give away many clues as to what's really going on without explicitly revealing anything. It's a good mystery, and it's killing me to not talk about certain characters, but I hate giving away spoilers even more. :3\
ARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - Perfect Blue had some amazing artwork in it -- the sets and scenes were very well rendered and I was particularly pleased with the realistic treatments of the female body in the various scenes that featured it. It isn't often you get nipples and pubes, anyway. There were some strange stylistic quirks in some characters though; thinking back, if they did it on purpose, it was a very clever way to set some characters apart from others, but otherwise, it just leaves you wondering why they failed on the facial anatomy here and again when, for the most part, everything and everyone else looks excellent. The animation was smooth and beautiful, and again, despite being an animated film, the cinematography was very much suited for a live action film. The way scenes transitioned and were put together was just amazing. Very well done indeed.\
MUSIC - This movie had a very, very effective soundtrack. Suspenseful scenes were enhanced by suspenseful music, but it wasn't so in-your-face that it felt over-the-top or corny. I'll be the first to admit that some of those jumpy scenes freaked me out, and the music played no small part in that. The less dramatic scenes naturally had less noticeable music. Mima's former pop trio CHAM!'s music was pretty generic-feeling, but that was probably the point. It was cute, and that was about it.\
VOICE ACTING - I saw this movie subbed. The cast was pretty average for the most part, but I really appreciated Junko Iwao's role as Mima because Mima herself is an actor. The range of emotion she goes through is pretty amazing, and the voice acting in those very high-tension (rape) scenes is very convincing (maybe even disturbingly so).\
OVERALL - I really enjoyed Perfect Blue. I walked into it knowing little more than that it was a Satoshi Kon movie (that's a plenty good enough reason to see it!), and to that extent, it definitely doesn't disappoint. The reality/fantasy theme that's so prevalent in Kon's later works is already here in full force, and I'd venture to say that the blur is even more effective here than it is in later works like Paprika and Paranoia Agent. It's worth repeating again that the cinematics are nothing short of amazing. The story is polished and has an excellent climax and ending; the character(s) are well-developed and well-played. The music is fitting, and the acting is top notch where it needs to be. Maybe watching it alone at 4am made it all the more suspenseful for me, but I'm sure it's just as enjoyable to see with friends in the middle of the afternoon. ;3",

    Anyone familiar with Satoshi Kon is probably also already familiar with what would make this movie intriguing. His works have a real appeal to fans of the surreal. It can be very mentally and visually stimulating. I've enjoyed other things by Kon, and I was really beginning to like this movie, however, by the end I had several problems with this film...\
Perfect Blue tries way too hard to synchronize the psychosis of multiple characters, all the while being far too vague about filling the viewer in on this objective. The result being an overtly complex attempt at immersing the viewer in utter confusion. The movie\
          \
        does a thorough job of making it literally impossible for most (any?) people to figure out whose psychosis they are witnessing. The juxtaposition of reality with dreams, fantasies, hallucinations, and apparently even premonitions, make for a potently perplex cocktail. I'm not sure why the movie prolongs the ambition of remaining so intentionally and completely vague, but even by the end of multiple viewings some things remain unclear. Perhaps there is some secret demand for this kind of gross ambiguity I'm not aware of, but it strikes me as inconsistent imagination or lazy writing -- or worse, pretentious writing. Like, \"Oh, look at how confusing and misleading I can be. You'll never figure this out.\"\
In general, Perfect Blue is fun to watch just for the surreal visual elements. It has very nice use of colors (darks, lights, illumination, etc.) and some trippy scenes. As a whole however, for me personally, this enjoyment was countered by the movies refusal to allow the audience to be able to discern reality from illusion. Now of course, I don't want to have things spelled out for me. I enjoy having my perception toyed with as much as the next person, but by the end of a movie, especially after watching more than once, I expect to at least have some grasp on what was \"really\" going on. Otherwise I just feel confused and frustrated wondering what the point to the whole thing was. Maybe with Perfect Blue that was the point...\

    The late, great Satoshi Kon: what a loss to the anime industry. In his feature film directorial debut (technically not his first director position, as Magnetic Rose came out in 1995), Kon brings us a haunting trip through the mind of a Pop Idol-turned-actress, Mima Kirigoe, as she struggles against the challenges presented to her through said change in careers. \
The story is an instantly familiar one- a tale that, if you follow the music and film industries at all, have heard many times: the rise and fall of the Disney Pop Princesses. Since the earliest days of child stars- they often times wash out,\
          \
        turn to substance abuse, or some other descent into madness- but a few make it out and turn into respectable, talented actors and actresses. Many of these former child prodigies have trouble finding success and being able to reinvent themselves, transcending their \"cute kid\" act, and trading it in for more credible adult roles. This is the essence of Mima's trials and tribulations. She is your Britney Spears. Your Lindsay Lohan. Your Miley Cyrus. Coming from a beginning of relative success- but wanting more- to mature, to eclipse the role of the teenage star and take on a more mature platform in life, and in status, no longer relegated to a typecast. But, our pasts follow us- and Mima's life is no different. \
Torn is the word that best describes her feelings towards her newly minted career in acting. Ambivalent. While Mima's fans clamor for the dainty, sparkly pure pop singer, she pushes forward in a grittier, more mature direction, seeking to distance herself from her past- and as such, goes to some rather extreme lengths, even shocking, to do so. It's the knee jerk reaction that we see from the teen pop stars here, too. An ever repeating, never ending saga of tragedy. Mima takes on any role that she's given, without question. Scenes that involve rape, or murder, she's fine with it because she \"wants to be an actress\" (irregardless of the fact that these are often seen as \"damaging\" roles to budding actors and actresses). In her personal life, she shrinks from her former friends, and draws away from her fans, wholeheartedly embracing this new life and career. But, she's still haunted by the mental image she has of herself as the Pop Idol. \
In a turn for the psychological, Kon weaves a narrative that plays out masterfully on the screen- particularly through his cinematography. The use of match cuts is phenomenal- particularly with the use of screens, and then pulling back to reveal that what we were seeing was actually on the set (since the movie is about a film/tv actress). Closeups of faces, pulling away to reveal them in a new setting are used to good effect too, along with textbook mirror shots. He also makes excellent use of jump cuts to create a jarring, unreliable narrative where we're not sure what to make of what's going on on screen and is further obfuscated when we see another layer of perspective in each successive cut.  This all serves to create a mind bending visual perspective- but it's not without its faint cues to let the audience know what's real and what isn't, if you're paying close attention. This brings me to another thing that Kon is a wizard with: detail. He rewards the audience by throwing out esoteric bits of imagery and small changes in the setting or characters that, when pieced together, give you a better understanding of the plot in what could otherwise be a real mess. I would not call Perfect Blue predictable, but knowing Kon's style and through paying close attention, one can discern part of the twist- but there are more than just a few \"gotcha\" moments. \
The weakest element of the movie is easily the sound. My copy of Perfect Blue is a hard subbed original Japanese audio- and the sound itself is very quiet, and the equipment used to record with was obviously not the highest caliber (scratchiness, slight echoes, or fuzz). The music too, was very sparse. This may have been an artistic choice, but I thought that it would have benefited from more music, rather than just in moments of action or tension. The voice acting was acceptable- not as oaky as my desk, but not nearly as dynamic as other productions. Bridget Hoffman is a bright spot as Mima in the English version, however. \
All in all, Perfect Blue was a great entrance for Kon, and an interesting psychological narrative in the vein of Memento, or The Usual Suspects (though it's definitely not as good as either). If you like mind benders with a very mature tone and content, you can't do much better than this. \

    Overview:\
Perfect Blue is one of the greatest psychological drama anime of all time. It was written by the master of mind bending, trippy anime: the late, great, Satoshi Kon. An interesting fact is that it is one of the favorite films of American director Darron Aranovsky, who paid Kon's studio royalty money for the right to reuse a scene from Perfect Blue in Aranovsky's \"Requiem for a Dream\". It is also interesting that Aranovsky denies that this film influenced Black Swan, despite the obvious parallels that he himself acknowledged were highly suspicious. Anyways, time to move on the actual review.\
Plot: 9/10\
The plot is that a\
          \
        young pop singer named Mima decides to leave her J-pop girl band and seek greater fame and glory as an actress. This greatly disappoints her fans including a very creepy stalker who calls himself the \"mimaniac\". Mima also notices that someone is claiming to be her online and running a website called Mima's Room. Mima has a hard time as an actress and is forced to take roles she really doesn't want including a rape victim. Eventually the stress starts to really effect Mima's mind and she begins to lose the ability to distinguish fantasy from reality, much like the stress induced delusions and hallucinations of the ballerina character Nina in Black Swan. Even the names are the same, just replace \"m\" with \"n\". The difference is that Mima actually does have people out to get her including a deranged serial killer who is hellbent on becoming the \"real\" Mima. The story's many twists and Mima's delusions and hallucinations gave the plot a very dreamlike quality. It can be a bit confusing at times if it is your first time watching it. I don't want to spoil anything, so I will simply end by saying that the plot was very well done overall. Even though the ending could have been better executed.\
Characters: 9/10\
The main character Mima shows us that celebrities are normal people who are effected by stress and worry just like everyone else, but they have legions of people worshipping them as if they are Gods and obsessing over their every move. It is especially hard for female actresses and singers that even in our more sensitive and  \"PC\" world of today are expected to always look and act \"sexy\" and have guys drool over them. It is an extra burden that most male celebrities really don't have. It is FAR easier to be an ugly man and get good roles in the US and ESPECIALLY in Japan than an ugly woman, where you will likely get typecast and boxed into obscure roles. The stress and expectations that celebrities face can take a real psychological toll and helps explain why so many celebrities act out in outrageous fashion or have complete psychological breakdowns. Mima never turns to drugs, crazy religions, or any of the other typical American celebrity coping mechanisms, but instead tries to carry all the weight and burdon of fame by herself. It is uplifting even if it strains the credibility of the film's realism, that in the end, she is able to grow as a person and overcome her real world struggles. Ok, the serial killer part isn't too realistic, but the coping with huge amounts of stress and expectation is in fact a very real world problem that this film has the courage to examine in a glaring light. The supporting characters are great as well, but Mima is the definite star of this film.\
Art: 10/10\
This is an artistic masterpiece! Even though it was made back in 1997, it still looks beautiful and fresh. The amount of color and detail that went into every frame of this movie is amazing. The backgrounds, characters, and animation are all superb. Nothing else to say here. Two thumbs way up!\
Sound: 7/10\
If I had any single criticism of this film, it would be that the soundtrack probably could have been better. It was fine, but sometimes didn't fit the dark tone of the movie.\
Enjoyment: 8/10\
The movie can be slow at times and quite confusing at others. Some scenes are very tense and uncomfortable and this isn't a happy \"popcorn\" movie. It may not be the funnest movie to watch, but it is a movie everyone should try out.\
Overall: 9/10\
I know it feels like I gushed praise on this film without objectively looking at the film's flaws, but this is honestly a very good movie. It is by no means a perfect film or Kon's best film, but I honestly really liked this one. If you are interested in psychological anime, older anime, or critically acclaimed anime, I would check this one out!\

    Perfect Blue is the greatest psychological thriller I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Let’s cut straight to the point, just as this rollercoaster of a film does\
This anime does a wonderful job of keeping the viewer engaged, not once did I get bored or wonder how much longer it is, all I could think was, “how can this get any better?” the whole time. And guess what? It did. \
Perfect Blue psychologically develops the main character, Mima, in a spectacular fashion. What this anime does best, however, is the complex story. The plot revolves around Mima taking her career down a different path\
          \
        from being a pop idol to becoming an actress. Sadly, there was no way she could have foreseen the grave danger awaiting her, just around the corner of her life. She ends up being cast in a TV series, and this is when the anime becomes quite surreal. Her identity begins to shift in response to trauma and other horrific events that happen to her, and she begins to lose her sense of who she once was. All the while, she has a deranged stalker following her every move, typing what she does every day on an online website pretending to be her. Tensions rise as her sanity slowly degrades and the paranormal takes over. The terrifying aspects of this film will begin to eat away at your sanity too, as you lose perception of what is real, and what is just an illusion in the movie. Satoshi Kon’s genius really shows when the elements bordering on the supernatural are symbolic of Mima’s mental state while also seeming believable in such a harsh yet realistic world. It is art in the truest sense when most everything that happens can mean more than what it seems to at first glance. \

    *No Spoilers Review*\
Perfect Blue is another unusual psychological horror/crime movie. There are two unique features in this movie;\
1-Realism: Perfect Blue uses realistic story elements (Ideas, Life problems, and Drama) and characters (Interactions, Designs, and Dialog).\
2-Dementia: Perfect Blue features an unusual first-person narrative point of view with a protagonist who is facing psychological hardship; thus creates confusion to the viewers.\
Alot of non-scary anime are labeled with the \"Horror\" tag on this website; However, Perfect Blue is another exception, out of all so called horror anime I've watched; I think it's safe for me to declare that Perfect Blue is the scariest of all.\
The movie has a\
          \
        fair amount of offensive contents; such as Nudity & Rape and Violence which is obviously not family-friendly.\
As for art/animation; as I mentioned before, the movie features a realistic character desgins and clothing, The animation was good and fluid.\
I'm not a fan of plain horror media but this anime is NOT just a horror movie that aims to scare the audience, this movie can also be considered as a Mystery/Crime movie; which are my favorites genres; hence this is what actually ruined my enjoyment, because the whole  mystery/crime stuff was ruined by the narration itself. As we experince the movie, we see the the author here is obscuring the mystery using the \"Dementia\" which created some vague outcomes, but that's actually what the movie aims for, it's trying too hard to confuse the viewer who will have a hard time to understand what actually happened, but the actual hidden reason is because these outcomes are actually illogical. \
Also the movie displays some long unnecessary series of dementia moments; (that even if you skipped them; you'll not miss anything of what's actually happening \"The main plot\"). And there's few more between the important events, but those are shorter,fortunately.\
So I suggest you to pay full attention during the whole movie and DON'T only focus on \"Dialog\", but focus even on small details such as (visuals, time & place, memorize names...etc) or else you may get lost at the 2nd half of the movie as it gets more confusing over time.\
-If you already have seen this movie; I suggest you to read my long post on discussion board or my blog post for full explanation of this confusing movie; and to exactly understand the points I listed on this review.\
-If you haven't seen the movie yet; go watch it, it's fun; you may also watch it comfortably without focusing too much as I explained it by every small detail there.",

    The idol industry may seem as something pleasant at first glance, be it the loyalty of the fans or the happiness build upon success. Behind this there is a lot of hard work involved, and suddenly quitting being an idol can have an emotional impact upon the fans, which can lead to jealousy and contempt, or even murder. Perfect Blue is a psychological thriller anime which delves into the dark side of the entertainment industry, in particular that of the idol and acting section.\
The story of Perfect Blue centers around Mima Kirigoe, who is a member of a small idol group. She decides to begin\
          \
        a career as an actress, which displeases the fans. The peaceful beginning of her career will soon be interrupted by violent disturbances around her, be it the stalker or murder of her coworkers. This does not only put a huge amount of stress on Mima herself, but on her manager Hidaka Rumi as well, who only wishes the best for Mima.\
While slowly drifting away from the idol image through her acting career (nudity, rape and her constant stress), Mima begins to lose grasp of reality presented through her own illusions. The detailed posts of her life on the internet didn't improve her condition in any way either.\
The narrative and realism is the strongest point of Perfect Blue.The story is easy to follow with a good pacing, allowing itself to 'stress' on certain points of the story to fully understand Mima's situation. As the story progresses, the spectator sees how everything unfolds, while wondering whether the things and dreams Mima sees are real or not: it really adds to the element of surprise and plot twists of the story.\
The cast of characters in Perfect Blue are by no means big: it centers mainly on Mima,the manager Rumi and the stalker. Instead of huge cast, there is great character development, where Mima undergoes the biggest changes. She goes from a somewhat positive character to a paranoid and depressed girl. Nearly all her emotions, be it fear or confusion, is shown and explained in detail, making it easy for the spectator to understand her behaviour.\
The side characters are by no means underdeveloped. Throughout the story we see their emotional state and their contribution to the development of Mima, as well as their emotional state. The supporting cast is done well too, as it contributed well to the story line and credibility. Some more development of Rumi may have been appreciated to fully understand her character, but this is a small drawback.\
The animation was well executed, with realistic motion patterns and expression of the characters. The background was satisfying as well, though nothing out of the norm. The sounds and music used in Perfect Blue matched well with the story, though no particular soundtrack caught my attention. Keep in mind that the movie was released in 1998, so don't expect any mind-blowing scenes.\
Perfect Blue was a thrilling watch, with a great story and well-developed characters. The narrative was nearly flawlessly executed, with supporting characters that upheld and enhanced the story. This movie is recommendable to everyone, just not for the younger spectators. If you like the psychological or thriller genre, then it is certainly a must watch. \

    I started watching this anime movie together with a friend of mine. He is a real movie junkie so I thought that this would be something new for him to try out. Although I knew he already had seen 'Spirited Away' and 'My Neighbor Totoro'.\
The movie started out pretty good, and early on you got a really earie feeling about the main character and the events that happen around her. After a while you start to doubt what is reality and what is not.\
This 'am I awake or not'- feeling can be related to many hollywood movies but it was the first time that I\
          \
        saw it being used in an anime movie. This is also the movies weakest point in my opinion, and at the same time its strongest argument as to why you need to watch it one more time. There are alot of things happening and getting a grasp of it at first will be a real trial.\
My friend had a ton of questions after we finished it. Some of it I could answer and some don't because it was a real headache. So be weary of this movie from the start. Give it a shot and also do a rewatch of it. That way you might but all the puzzle pieces together.\

    I’ve recently finished to watch both Neon Genesis Evangelion and the related film, the End of Evangelion. It seemed impossible to find something more mind blowing than that, but I was wrong. \
This review won’t contain spoliers.\
\
Story 9/10\
Perfect Blue talk about a pop-idol called Mima Kirigoe, that is forced by her managers to leave the pop world, that she loved, to become an actress, considered a more economically convenient work. At the beginning she feels free without all the commitments that she had while she was a singer, but after a while something changes and the reality of her as an actress starts to mix\
          \
        with the illusion of her as a pop-idol. And a strange stalker is following her... \
Even if the story at the beginning might seem clear and linear, while the anime progresses you start to lose the perception of what is true and what is an illusion. Satoshi Kon, the director, manages to involve the watcher in the anime, putting yourself in the shoes of the protagonist and its paranoia. Everything is made even more confusing by the fact that Mima is acting in a film and usually it’s hard to distinguish the reality from the film and from Mima’s illusions too. \
\
Art & Animation 8/10\
The art is weird, facial proportions are distorted in nearly all characters except for Mima and a few others. The animation isn’t the best I’ve seen, but since this is an anime from 1998 it isn't really a concern. The staff probably wanted to use the exterior aspect of the characters to externalize how they really are inside: for example, Me-Mania, the fanatic stalker, has a grotesque face that will probably give me nightmares if I continue to think about it. \
Colors are mainly dull, the general atmosphere is gloomy and surreal. The art style fits very well the story and the themes discussed, drawings and animation manage to give you the sense of alienation typical of this dementia genre.\
\
Sound 7/10\
I don’t remember any particular music except the ending one, that is particularly enjoyable, but that’s probably because you can’t in any possible way focus on the OST while you are watching and trying to understand an anime like this. Unfortunately I couldn’t find the japanese version of Perfect Blue, so I had to watch the english dubbed version, that isn’t as good as I expected. I hope to find it one day in the original language to watch it again.\
\
Characters 8/10\
Mima is the center of all the story and the anime is a study of every aspect of her psychology. The story goes really deep in character’s development of not only the protagonist, but also of Me-Mania and Rumi Hidaka, that are a sort of co-protagonists rather than supporting. As I’ve already said in the Art paragraph, the external appearence is also a determinant factor in the analysis of the characters, so you can really have a 360 degrees view about them.\
\
Enjoyment 8/10\
If you want to understand Perfect Blue, you can’t lose any single word of it, and even this isn’t enough. I confess that after the last scene I immediately went to search for an explanation. What I found was a list of many interpretations, each one different from the others. After reading two/three of them I only had even more confusion in my head, that’s why I’ll probably watch it again and search for some details that I’ve probably missed. \
Perfect Blue manages to catch you since the beginning, when everything becomes strange and you feel that you can only continue to try to understand something. The questions made by Mima are the same you make to yourself, while everything revolves around you and her. She doesn’t understand? Well, you don’t understand too. That’s why I enjoyed this anime a lot, it managed to arise that type of interest that mainly only thriller genre normally does.\
Should you watch it? Yes, if the old style doesn’t concern you and you aren’t scared about having your mind blowed, watch it. Just keep in mind that the rating is R+, there are indeed some pretty violent and disturbing parts.",

    I’ve been meaning to watch this for a long time and often felt weird having gone on all these years watching anime…without ever seeing this. Make no mistake, it’s been on my radar for over a decade but I’ve often felt intimidated by the premise of this film, not feeling up to the challenge. But as with all good things, they come to those who wait and since I have Perfect Blue on Blu-ray and was well in the mood to watch it, finally maturing I finally thought that tonight was as good as any to pop it in and give it a spin…and boy\
          \
        was that a ride.\
To attempt to go too in-depth with this would be foolhardy on my behalf and would inevitably leave me flat on my face, so I don’t feel like exposing myself too much, but to just shrug and say “it’s alright” isn’t going to do this movie justice either. After watching Perfect Blue I felt like I had just witnessed a master class in direction…and make no mistake it is a master class performance. The late director Satoshi Kon demonstrates just why his name is so known and just why he’s so revered here within this 1 hour 20 minute roller-coaster. The story here is manipulated with such finesse and fine tuning it’s reminiscent of a puppeteer, orchestrating its every move. Everything is placed where it is for a reason, in order to tell the story. Simple gestures come back to haunt you maybe an hour later, mundane activities are woven into the story to such a degree that it almost boggles the mind. So much scrutiny is at play here, everything has been stressed over. Satoshi Kon is a master of his art, one that should and is no doubt studied.\
Some of the emotions this movie conjured up from within me were maybe something I was uncomfortable expressing. I felt exposed and bare. A certain scene in this film had me tear up at just how uncomfortable I was, sick to my stomach and my heart beating as I reached out with one hand to switch the movie off…but I didn’t. I watched on, I’m glad I did, but the feelings were tangible. I felt terrible, but that was the plan. Perfect Blue fully engrosses its audience and makes them truly invested in this story before it stabs you in the heart and twists the knife.\
The cinematography and choreography at play here is truly astonishing and a sight to behold. Being a movie about an idol dancing and singing, I guess that’s to be expected. Nothing is sacred here, what is a dream and what is reality? The way in which Satoshi Kon weaves each and every story thread and each and every scene truly makes you the viewer feel like the main character herself, an ex-Pop star who wants to make a career change as an actress. This allows for a movie that truly has its audiences guessing as to what reality is indeed, what a dream is and what the acting is as it jumps from scene to scene, moment to moment as you try to string it all together. This truly mirrors the mind of the main character, Mima Kirigoe, who cannot discern dream from reality or from her on screen counterpart to her real self.\
In terms of art style, Madhouse utilizes a more realistic approach in the way that the characters and the world itself are depicted. The Blu-ray doesn’t look perfect, with (no pun intended) some scenes looking a little blue, but considering the films age it looks great overall with strong character designs and amazing uses of visual cues such as pink outfits, mirrors and such in order to distinguish characters and make them pop out in an otherwise dull (purposely so) world. Architecture and the world itself is pretty simple in design here, but effective and works well and a heavy use of bloom and scan lines are evident throughout in order to contrast one scene from the next, from dream and reality.\
The audio is great here too, with the voice acting being topnotch. Every line is delivered believably and you really fall into the trap of believing that these animated characters are in fact real and tangible. The cast here does feel real, and genuine with the performances they deliver alongside the great animation and character designs. Being a story about an ex-pop star, pop music is no doubt a cornerstone to the soundtrack of Perfect Blue and it works effortlessly used in juxtaposition between the gritty onscreen accounts and the lively vocals of CHAM!, the fictional pop group the movie here focuses on.\
Perfect Blue is a deep movie, one tackling the issues surrounding identity and the fragility of it all, especially for a person who is in the limelight of sorts. Does your work define you? How do you make sense of yourself when the lines blur? The use of both mirrors, puddles and reflections are used in order to visually articulate such ideas in a way that only animation would be able to do. The question is often brought up, why is Perfect Blue animated? Well it’s true that a live action adaptation was released years later, with Perfect Blue itself originally slated to be a live action itself back in 1993. Throughout the years, many films have also tried incorporating themes and images from the film into their own as well, however I’d make the argument that Perfect Blue, the story told here in its animated incarnation uses the medium to its full advantage, and does so masterfully.\
Whether it’s the use of a nonlinear, non-chronological layout, the ghosts of the main character representing her former image, dancing mockingly around her current self or the depiction of this innocent animated image being marred and muddied as its carried through this fascinating story, Perfect Blue is without doubt a movie that is not only a master class, but no doubt genre defining. Not for the faint of heart, but given that you’re ready to open your mind and appreciate this artistic take on a girl struggling to find her identity, you’ll have something to think about for a long time with the meandering plot, powerful imagery and many twists that will have you satisfied by the end.\

    Before watch this show, I've never thought I would apreciate so much an anime based on Dementia and Paranoia elements. But man, it's absurdly captivating. I just watched it straight, inebriated by the complex and deep narrative.\
Based in a novel from Yoshikazu Takeuchi (that I didn't read so far) and direct by Satoshi Kon, the story is not something that could be simply exposed here. I could say that's about a female character that after a career change, sees her life sinking into an ocean of uncertainty and despair, through a series of mysterious murders and illusions, so realistic that erase her notion of the\
          \
        real world. But goes further, oh boy, much further.  It explores the contrary line of a common narrative, causing on the viewer the discomfort by discontinuation of reality and the impossibility of dissociation between what's really happening and what's pure illusion. But the most impressive is the show's capacity of self-explain in a way that we all can understand. The humanity of characters it's more than enough to get us, even in a awkward way, inserted on the dense environment where they are.\
The animation is one of the most realistic I've ever seen. It's not just about action, it's about expression. You can read all character expression as a book. A good book by the way. And the sound it's just wonderful, making you feel the fear, the agony and the confusion that the show wants to provide to the viewer. The conexion between the scenes and the soundtrack is amazing, departing completely from the conventional.\
Last but not least, the characters. Generally, they are the most important element of a narrative, because are the links between the viewer and the happenings of a show. But what about the characters being used as an self-insertion artifice by the characters themselves? Seriously, this anime creates probably one of the most, if not the most, complex environment about characterization. They're real? They're not? At the end, everything becomes clear in one of the best finales I've seen until today. Seriously, talk about plot-twists.\
So, for me, it's not just a recommended anime. It's like a must-see show for all the people, young or old, fan or haters of anime. This was spectacularly well produced and makes me think about the degeneration that most animes are in today. Another psychological anime? No, this is THE psychological anime. Enjoy it.\

    Personas, we all have them to an extent. Even the most consistent and honest people will act slightly different at home with their parents, hanging out with their friends, dealing with their boss, or alone with their lover. But these personas are usually consistent enough that no real issues arise. But what happens when the personas are so different that even we can't tell which is our mask and which is our true face? And those problems are compounded when we're in the public eye and huge numbers of anonymous people expect us to act in just a certain way. Acting 'Out of Character' is\

        serious business indeed in Satoshi Kon's home-run directorial debut. \
-Story-\
This is the kind of story you see once, spend some time to think about it, and then immediately watch it again to test your theories. It starts out well-grounded in reality, but slowly things begin getting crazier at just the right to keep you guessing while never completely overloading you. Oh, you certainly won't understand everything, but you'll know - or think you know- just enough to keep you engaged as you try to refine your theory faster than 'Blue' can throw twists at you. Kon excels at tension and pacing. I've seen 24 episode anime series that handled far less complex stories than this suffer from 'plot pileup' as they desperately try to wrap everything up towards the end, but 'Perfect Blue' manages to pull-off a brilliant mind-screw in little more than 75 minutes. Let me repeat: *75* minutes. That's typically the length of a cheap home video release aimed at children- and Kon did more here than most 2+ hour live-action films can hope to accomplish. Not a minute is wasted and you'd BETTER pay attention.\
*As a side-note, as I write this review in 2015 when there are teenagers who have never known an internet-less world, it's fascinating to get a flashback to my childhood as a boy of the 90's. The internet is this strange new thing in 1998, social media is unheard of, the public at large is still being sold on the idea that they too can connect to the 'information superhighway', and even well-known celebrities are fascinated with the idea of people talking about them online. Just a bit of a nostalgia trip for us older anime fans. Like Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window', there's no way this exact plot would work in a film set in today's world.\
-Art-\
Pretty good for late-90's animation, but not flawless. 'Blue' definitely cheats a bit during long range shots, but that's just a small qualm overall. Character designs are very good- I particularly liked main character Mima's look. She looks cute but not 'cutesy', undoubtedly attractive but not some classical Grecian beauty. The design really sells her persona of a sweet, likable girl who's getting into situations that are at odds with her personality. Demented otaku stalker Mr. Me-Mania has to be one of the most disturbing designs I've ever seen (which is fitting considering his role).  The high level of realism in the art is critical to selling the 'psycho-thriller' vibe of Perfect Blue. And while a few other character faces may seem slightly 'off', I have my own theory as to why that would be intentional and not an artistic flaw- but I'm not going to spoil it here. \
-Sound-\
Even before 'Cowboy Bebop' produced what's typically considered *THE ENGLISH DUB TO END ALL ENGLISH DUBS*, major movies tended to get pretty decent voice work in my experience. After watching 'Blue' in Sub and Dub, I'd call it a toss-up as both are good, but in the event of a tie I personally go with Dubs. Bridgette Hoffman does a stellar job with Mima, able to convincingly go from 'innocent and cutesy' when she's in her pop idol persona, to 'psychologically tormented' in the later half of the film. The OST is rather sparse all things considered, lots music-less moments are used to great effect. When the music is playing it's pretty 90's, but fits the tone well so it ages without significant issue.\
-Characters-\
This is Mima's story, with other cast members deriving their importance from how they affect her. Or perhaps it's better to say that this the tale of several different Mimas. There's the Mima she thinks she is, the Mima she tries to become, the actress Mima some try to make her be for their own benefit, the pop idol Mima others dogged refuse to get over, and they're all slugging it out for the right to be called the real Mima. In the end every character is driven by and acts in accordance to what they they tell themselves Mima is. And if our leading lady wants to stay on the right side of sanity, she'd better figure out which persona is the real her in a hurry... There's a reason Miss Kirigoe is on my list of top anime characters of all time.\
-Enjoyment-\
I have a personal bias favoring stories centering around characters locked in an internal struggle with different version of themselves, so 'Perfect Blue' definitely played to my preferences. But even without that bias, this film will still appeal to any anime fan willing to approach it seriously- this definitely isn't a movie you watch just for dumb fun. With its mature storytelling and highly realistic art, this would make a good gateway for new fans who want something adult but think anime is just Pokemon and Dragonball Z.\
-Overall-\
'Perfect Blue' is of the ultimate arguments against the conventional wisdom that 'animation can't handle a serious story'. Yes, yes it can. Satoshi Kon delivered a nearly flawless psycho-thriller on his first major project that rivals anything live-action can put on screen. \

    Movies are very limited in scope due to their length, what anime could achieve story and theme wise is cannot be achieved by the movie as anime spams hundreds of episodes and movie only has only 2 hours at best. On the other hand movies have excellent budget making them panicle of Visuals and due to the short length they have adopted unique storytelling telling techniques. You can easily see and feel the difference between an Anime and Movie story structure which are wildly different. The story structure of movies can be great it is unfortunately easy to hack. That brings me to perfect blue\
          \
        and let’s begin with some positive points.\
Perfect Blue is very well directed, every scene is well thought out and well directed to match theme of the movie, Satoshi Kon did a very good job of directing this movie. As you will expect from any movie, visuals and animations are fluid and staggering. The dark and unsaturated tone of the visuals blends well with the theme of the Movie. I am not a big fan of dark and bland visuals but they do their job well. Overall visuals of the Perfect Blue are outstanding and animation is somewhat innovative. Now we take a step forward to the story and I have no praise for it.\
The story of perfect blue is simple to understand and it is like a story that is simple but trying to be complex and serious and this is where I say that it is very easy to hack a movie. By hack I mean is to create a shallow piece of work and show it as a deep and thoughtful work. Just like a mirage has an illusion of water, perfect blue has the illusion of integrity, deepness, and maturity but just like a mirage, it is an illusion. Now let me clarify myself and let us understand the structure of the story and its theme.\
Every story follows a theme or every theme follows a story and if both get disconnected in one way or another story fails to make a point and it is unenjoyable, the story that is not visuals. Let just take Death Note as an example as many of you should have watched it completely. Death Note follows the theme of justice, it asks the question like “What is Justice?”, “Are criminal’s human?” etc. But it never leaves its theme of justice and when it leaves that theme in the second season all of the drama and tension falls to the ground and Death Note feels like a typical criminal vs detective anime and you may agree with me on this. Anime which is based on a particular theme can lose its luster after diverting from it. But only having the strong theme is not enough you have to show it with the story.\
Perfect Blue is a patchwork of many themes and ideas which people can call mature. The theme such as identity crisis, dark parts of the film industry, mental illness, stalkers, rape so on and on. Now I have no problems with such themes but I have the problem with the intent behind it, these themes are there to deceive viewer to see the movie as more mature, deep, dark and realistic than it actually is. What I am saying is that perfect blue insults its theme and uses it for marketing purposes than to actually make a point or at least to provide some entertainment and oh god critics and reviewers love this kind of stuff. Let’s take a theme to understand what I mean.\
Stalking is a real-world problem that celebrity and even common people face. Stalking is shown in a very narrow sense and only form point of view of the person who is the victim. There is no exploring the issue and in the end, that stalker is nothing but a mad and purely evil person. I am not against single-minded approach but Perfect Blue states form the start that it is taking these things seriously but fails to do so and same is with every theme. Perfect blue changes its theme’s so quickly like an octopus changing its skin color. First, it is all about identity than about stalking then about rape and mental illness, due to this Perfect Blue fails to be integral and never address what it is trying to conceive. This make’s whole movie a mess of ideas and nothing more.\
Characters in perfect blue are just as one dimensional as the movie. One wants to be a singer and an idol but somehow decided to pursue an acting career, another what to be her I don’t know why, another wants to follow her and bed her for no reason at all and second one kills everyone close to the first one and I don’t know why. There is only one explanation to all this that all three of them are seriously fucked up in the head. I didn’t find any characters loveable and I hated everyone including the main character.\
All I can say that Perfect Blue is a movie that was made to win awards and critical success, it is made to perform and nothing else. It is made to look dark, edgy and mature for an inexperienced audience (Yes I am insulting my own viewers but not those who are reading it right now OK ^). I have no other words for this movie than a fools play without any value and meaning, the movie just wanders around in an endless pit of darkness and that is the movie nothing more and nothing less. But that was no more than my opinion and an opinion of a lonely blogger has no value but Satoshi Kon does.\

    Okay well \"Perfect Blue\" is a very distinct anime and it is very much open to any type of interpretation you may wish to perceive. I loved this \"Perfect Blue mainly because it touched me on a personal level as identity and mental illness are key aspects of the movie and I have always found these aspects intriguing. \
Never again, no never again will I witness an anime movie (ova) as good as \"Perfect Blue\". Throughout the whole anime movie I was emotively impacted as my heart was racing, I constantly got goosebumps and became trembly during some drastic scenes. I absolutely loved how it\
          \
        stepped outside of the box by unconventionally challenging the audiences perceptions on identity and mental illness through numerous horrific and psychological aspects. I especially loved the aspect of 'inception' and generally I don't like overly confusing animes such as \"Ergo Proxy\" (still an awesome anime), though this one is definitely an exception. \"Perfect Blue\" undoubtably has to be one of the best animes I have ever seen, I'd say it easily sits up there with \"Elfen Lied\", \"Clannad\", \"Monster\" and \"Death Note\" (my personal fav's). I don't think I have ever been more enthralled for 1h 50mins whilst watching anime XD. The only downfall to the anime if you can really count this as one, is that the animation (graphics) isn't top notch. Then again, its made in 1997 ~ So I commend the creators on the traditional methods used to create the movie ;) \
Rating; 10/10 \
Now explaining it for more insight: (Spolier Below) \
Basically from my interpretation Mima whom once was a famous Pop Idol decides to try to become a actress so she can become furthermore rich and famous. During her metamorphosis she's starts to doubt her sense of identity and as a result suffers from extreme forms of mental illnesses (esp. schizophrenia), hence the symbolic form of her old \"pop star\" self, that she keeps seeing- metaphorical meaning.\
Rumi her manager plays as the \"bad person\" and she is the allegory to the movie. Rumi missed out on her opportunity to become famous, thus she perceives herself as Mima and commits all the murders in order to gain revenge on all the people who tarnished Mima' reputation... or what she believed was her own reputation. Rumi suffers from mental illness (dissociative identity disorder) and never overcomes this as she's stuck in her own reality- this is imperative as its through Rumi's hardship that Mima finally succeeds in the end is able to find her true identity. \
Uchida (fish looking guy) is the metaphor to the story, he is very much like Rumi, but due to his mental instability becomes overly obsessed and insane with Mima. Hence its seen that Uchida is a very lonely, depressed and insecure individual who has never had someone to love and care for him. Therefore is obsession of roots from a source of autism, thats why he looks weird and is addicted to Mima.  Regardless, he is a very significant symbol for Mima as he highlights the importance of never forgetting about your past and who you truly are deep down as a person. \
In the end, it becomes evident that through Mima's experiences as both a Pop Idol and Actress, she finally understands who she truly is. Its also through Mima's experiences and encounters with both Rumi and Uchida  that she endures psychological hardship, but learns a valid lesson in finding her self. Hence the main message of the movie is that \"life is a continuous learning experience\" as Mima starts to learn about her own identity as a person. The movie also is symbol in expressing how mental illness is a drastic issue that controls an individual to  perceive the world in an unrealistically sense. Another key point is that through transitions (Mima's journey) one can find who they truly are. This is inevitably impacted by experiences and attitudes that an individual will encounter through their life long journey. \

    First of all, if you haven't watched this but you had watched Black Swan, then try to forget Black Swan or you'll be trapped on Black Swan atmosphere like I did when I watched it for the first time. Yes, BS might be inspired by Perfect Blue, but the storyline itself is really different, some scenes are related or similar but no, this is not BS. You need to sit down and relax while you're watching this or you'll stuck in a confusion, like I did due to thinking how PB is similar to BS.\
But anyway, enough with Black Swan, Perfect Blue is a masterpiece,\
          \
        thriller fans would enjoy this even you've never watched anime before. Exactly no drama, this is why the storyline is fast and to the point, thriller all the way. Some scenes are quite graphic, while nudity, violence, and gore might be not bothering anyone, rape scenes might be not enjoyable, but the main character face her rapist in a proud way, so feminists need not to rant about it.\
It's just for a beautiful anime, I was hoping a more memorable music, but no. I'm not sure whether the story itself so enjoyable that I forgot about the music, or the music itself not really remarkable, I didn't remember wether it has a soundtrack or not.\
Overall, you gotta watch this. This is a masterpiece, like Spirirted Away, this is something an anime fans should watch at least once in their life time.",

    Japanese Anime is interesting in that while there are commercially driven movies and series made simply to sell toys and merchandise, amid the glut of such mainstream productions exist more daring, ambitious experiments which can nonetheless be considered great works of art. Satoshi Kon's directorial debut, Perfect Blue, is one such Anime. It is very rare to see an adult-driven, psychologically frightening suspense-drama that we would mostly get from directors such as Alfred Hitchcock, and the creator of The Sixth Sense and Signs, but Satoshi Kon proves that, if given the proper treatment, animation can be used to not only entertain, but to strike emotional\
          \
        chords and leave a lasting impact on even the most jaded of viewers. \
First and foremost, Perfect Blue is ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. This is an extremely dark and occasionally bloody thriller that will probably leave young viewers traumatized for weeks. It's about a Japanese pop idol, Mima, who decides to abandon her longtime J-Pop status with her performing group, CHAM, and become an actress. This doesn't sit well with her fans, particularly one deranged, creepy looking schmuck who stalks her from the shadows for a large marjority of the film.  Matters take a turn for the worse when Mima takes part in a sexually-charged psycho-thriller series (which requires our heroine to shoot a disturbing rape sequence). A fan-made website details Mima's activities... even her most intimate ones! (She even starts to get hate mail from her fans.) Things get even more out of hand when her 'virtual identical twin' (or something along those lines, who still wears the pop idol dress and has a deceivingly cheerful smile on her face) emerges from the website and taunts the young ex-pop idol about her 'tarnished reputation.' In addition, her friends and associates become the targets of a mysterious imposter posing as Mima. \
If there's anything going against Perfect Blue, it may be the second half. While the first half is carefully cultivated and plotted, the latter part of the film becomes a little difficult and confusing to follow, as director Kon switches erratically between reality and surrealism, leaving viewers struggling to figure out what's REALLY happening and what isn't. Suffice to say, this isn't a film for everyone, but what ultimately makes Perfect Blue is how engrossed we are with the film, even when it starts to get more complicated (not in a mind-numbingly incoherent way like, say, Neon Genesis Evangelion), risque (in addition to the aforementioned rape scene--which, although obviously artificial, is quite disturbing to watch--we see shots of Mima posing nude for a perverted photographer as well as a classic scene involving Mima kneeling in her bathtub, clutching her knees, screaming her frustration over participating in such stuff), and violent (there are quite a bit of bloody scenes at points--including one person stabbed repeatedly to death in the eye, hands, back, etc., and occasional shots of brutally wounded suspects via letters containing bombs). I normally cannot stomach these kind of films, but this one is an exception. Primarily because Kon makes us FEEL Mima's plight and compels us to root for her in order to avoid being killed herself. Of course, I was very puzzled at points in the film, but perhaps that is the point Kon is trying to make--some scenes give us the information we are asking for, but with others, we are simply required to interpret them ourselves. \
This certainly seems to be the case with the (absolutely unexpected) surprise ending. I won't give it away, but it WILL take one a lot of viewings to truly comprehend the meaning of the last scene. \
Technically, the animation falls somewhat short in comparison to some of Kon's later works, notably Paprika.  Frankly, though, it's still quite good and complimentary to the tone of Perfect Blue.  As far as the sound goes, the music is a mixture of cheesy (but infectious) J-pop techno and a moaning, eerie women's choir vocalizing wordlessly (this succeeds in making the film all the more frightening).  The voice acting is top notch on the English version courtesy of AniMaze, inc., with Ruby Marlowe (Mima) and Wendee Lee (Rumi) turning in particularly compelling performances.  The vocal tracks in the film are translated well, too, although the somewhat British-accented singing is hard to distinguish at times.\
Perfect Blue is disturbing and violent, yes, but as an animated horror/thriller tale for grown-ups, its kinetic direction and dramatic staging is unparalleled.\

    \"Perfect Blue\" is a great movie that follows the literary \"Fall from Grace\" situational archetype. This is an exciting psychological thriller with a lot of twists and turns, while managing to stay cohesive. It's not a small feat to execute this type of story, while keeping the viewer on the same page. \
The director managed to convey the confusion and psychological turmoil that the protagonist was going through. The shift in mood was so well-done, that it almost made the viewer experience the events through her eyes.\
The character design and its wide variety of facial expressions and body language managed to convey the ideas directly.\

    To start with,this movie has quite a few gory scenes that might make you cringe and it is exposive and violent in nature,so it is cetainly not for the faint-hearted.\
Mima is a pop-idol who is living her dream and is at peace with her job and life.She enjoys quite some popularity among fans of the genre and is well renowned.But not always can you do what you want to in the real world.Her agency wants her to quit being a pop-idol and become an actress simply because of the twisted reason that they weren't making much money out of her.Not wanting to leave what she\
          \
        loves doing and at the same time wanting to gain more acceptance and popularity besides fearing that she would otherwise be troubling the people in the agency,Mima decides to take the leap.And then she encounters the harsh reality.She is exposed to the cruel and perverted film industry where everyone starting from the director to the photographer tries and exploits her,be it getting her practically raped by making her shoot a rape scene in a bar or photograph her in full nudes and print them in magazines,and she can do nothing but comply,in fear of not dissapointing her seniors and not getting accepted by the audience.\
And then it all begins.Mima starts hallucinating,seeing her former pop-idol self appear out of nowhere and telling her that she is now a wasted woman and just a fake.The real Mima is the pop-idol Mima who still exists.She starts haunting her day and night and soon Mima loses her sanity,she fails to distinguish between reality and dreams.She can't tell what she is doing in her real life and what she is doing in her movie shoots.Additionally,a series of murders starts taking place.Those who tried to exploit her start getting killed one by one of multiple stab wounds and this haunts her even further.She comes across a website dedicated to her where someone runs a blog in her name and claims that the pop-idol Mima still exists and the actress one is an imposter.Her every move is listed in details there,her every secret quoted.She begins to doubt herself in agony and distress and wonders whether she is alive or not,whether all of this is  dream and whether it is true that she herself commited those crimes subconciously as some other personality.To add to this,there is a stalker,a fan of hers,who shadows her every move and can't cope with her betrayal to fans of her pop shows and is on the verge of going berserk.\
The animation is crude and it fits the atmosphere perfectly.Not once could I turn away from this anime because it was so unexplicably exciting.\
The voice acting and sound is good enough and elevates the experience further.\
Psychological thrillers are at large,mostly of high quality in terms of storyline and are well thought out which adds to their charm and Perfect Blue stands at the peak of the mountain.With a rarely achieved perfect ending and nail-biting sequences,it leaves no space to ask for anything more.\

    Calling this show's genre psychological is an overstatement. Increasingly, shows like this don't depend on the psychological nature of the story or detail any more but just try to disrupt our thought and senses by throwing loads of scattered scenes and psychologically make us think they are doing a psychological show...\
The story is simple. An pop idol bounces to become an actress but she is dissatisfied and then a murder series happen. The evidences point to a minor, then to her, then at last someone close to her jumps out and claims all the sin.\
The art is old-fashioned but that's no problem. The problem is\
          \
        an unimpressive soundtrack score. You can't hear any sound at most times because silence is needed. But when sound is needed it doesn't work either.\
The thing that bugs me most that this show also use human's stupidity to create thriller. For example, the main character - the idol girl hysterically chases down her shadow to the middle of the street, and then in another scene, she turns her back to and runs away from some injured murderer who wants to take her life.\
We all know it's rational to strike back rather then run away, especially when your first hits are successfully landed on the bastard. You would say maybe this is called the \"dream factor\" because it's more psychologically exciting to run away while you are in a dream because you can do unimaginable feats like leaping over houses. However, in the show, she did that while awake, and I wouldn't be that stupid even in my dream. Or it's the nature of women, except for policewomen, to be stupid at action.\
Anyway, an unimpressive story won't make a psychological show unless you forcefully make it like this, so... go waste your time.\

    Once again, I’m exploring into the material of the late Satoshi Kon and see how much of an influence and mind fuck they can be. Only time, it involves the subject of pop idols in Japan. What is a pop idol, you may ask? A pop idol in Japan are media personalities in their teens to twenties who’re considered to be very appealing and attractive…..to at least for a few years. I would say it’s like the similarity to most Disney Channel / Nickelodeon or any other squeaky clean celebrity; adored by the public but when you try to transcend yourself out of that image,\
          \
        it gets harder to do that so. The only thing sometimes the consequences can be a bit worse, as that happened in the film.\
\
Mima Kirigoe, a member of a Japanese pop-idol group called “CHAM!” who decides to pursue her career as an actress. Some of her fans are displeased with her sudden career change, particularly a stalker named Me-Mania. As her new career proceeds, Mima’s world becomes increasingly reminiscent of the works of Alfred Hitchcock: reality and fantasy spiral out of control, including string of murders claiming the lives of her TV show colleagues and Mima discovers that Me-Mania is the least of her troubles.\
\
Now getting into the story, I say that the plot and the whole story is still relevant to today as when you want to further your career but there is some backlash from fans who think different of that and only see her as something for their enjoyment and theirs only, even so far is to actually start stalking you, putting your life and your psyche in danger and it delves into the dark side of the transition from an idol to an actress or whatever career you pursue after that. For those that say the pacing felt slow, well, I wouldn’t say that as an insult as it takes a while to get into the story and plus, its 80 minutes long….it didn’t manage to be too overbearingly long. I like that it dealt with what I just previously mentioned and doesn’t skimp through the details of that. Plus, there are some surprises that I didn’t expect watching this for the first time and the second time (yeah, I watch this twice) it finally got to me with what’s going on with Mima’s pop-idol personality haunting her. I also have heard of comparisons to the 2010 Darren Aronofsky movie Black Swan, which does share similarities with each other although Aronofsky said that it didn’t have much of an influence.\
\
Characters are sort of interesting in a way to study and about them. I like Mima and I get her whole transition and seeing how it’s not the easiest thing to do and you can sense that during that rape scene (As in “filming a rape scene in a film, not actual rape happening”) and preferably when she first revealed it to everyone. The supporting characters seem alright like Rica, Mima’s manager who was against her transition but I was with Tadokoro, Mima’s office manager who looks at the crossover in a positive manager.\
\
This film was released in 1997, as in you know the animation for this film is going to look dated but for it is pretty good vintage, especially vintage material from Madhouse and like many of their earlier productions, they have their stylistic choices of artwork and felt like it was suited for a live-action film, although in actuality, animated makes it more interesting.\
\
Musically, aside from the pop idol songs I heard in the movie, there isn’t much that really standout to me. It’s an alright score and all but slightly somewhat vaguely memorable to me. As for the English dub by Animaze, I quite like it. It was on par with their good English dubs in the ’90s and I really did love the performances for Mima (Ruby Marlowe) and Rica (Wendee Lee) as they really standout for me when watching this.\
\
FINAL VERDICT: I say this as an anime fan, you should give this a watch and I say the same thing as a movie buff but seeing Black Swan before and noticing the comparisons, I wouldn’t call it as “Anime Black Swan before live-action Black Swan” that quick. Hell, I forgot about the whole Black Swan thing once I watch the movie. It has its insightful, artistic, and psychological elements that make it all into a good Satoshi Kon movie, maybe not his strongest but I still recommend it to most audiences.",

    This is definitely a film you need to watch more than once. I think it’s pretty close to what you would get if David Aronofsky, David Lynch and a very young Walt Disney decided to make a movie together. I like adult anime and “Perfect Blue” fits the definition. This is not for children. A Pop Idol, Mima Kirigoe, decides to become an actress and in the process appears to descend into madness. Sounds pretty simple, right? Well, It isn’t. So much information is packed into Mima’s journey that, even when you’re paying attention, you might find it confusing at times. I found watching it\
          \
        the second time was even more enjoyable that the first time but don’t let that put you off. This script pays homage to several master directors and is extremely well done. Even the English language dubbing is tight enough to not be distracting. There are threats on Mima’s life, she’s stalked and has a fake website put up in her name. Add letter bombs, stabbings, disassociative personality disorder all tied to a non-linear story line and you end up with an haunting psychological thriller with a more suspenseful ending than a lot of well known mainstream motion pictures. The tagline sums it up beautifully: The Color of Illusion is Perfect Blue. \

    Warning possible Spoilers\
Madhouse is known for being a master of making psychological anime's and Perfect Blue is a prime example of that, probably the best example I've seen to date.\
Story (10/10)\
The story concentrates on Mima Kirigoe, who has quit her idol job to become an actress, but whats she's about to learn is that not everyone is happy with her change.\
The best thing about the whole film is seeing the slow change in Mima's path to insanity, as she tries to get used to her new acting career she is being tormented by an illusion of her previous self and the interactions between them get\
          \
        more and more intense each time.\
The film keeps specifying that a huge fan of Mima when she was a pop idol, is keeping tabs on her every move and it's creepy to the point where you can't trust anybody. I also really love how the film constantly messes with our mind in wondering whether at times if reality is really real and isn't all a dream, because it gets pretty damn freaky the more the film progresses.\
It also really shows how Mima's career really starts to affect her judgement and her surroundings as she loses her grip on reality from all the fake news by the fake Mima.\
However another thing this film did really great was how it handled the whole murder situation, at first we thought it was obviously the guy who was stalking Mima under the profile name Me-Mania and it made me think it would eventually build up to Mima's and Me-Mania's confrontation. However there was certain points where it even made Mima look like the murder in one of the cases, so at that point I didn't really know who was the true killer and then when Mima managed to take down Me-Mania it pulled one of the biggest twists I have seen in a long time on who the true killer really is and it amazed me.\
Character (9/10)\
Mima is really the only character taking note of here, but her character is friggin amazing although not by personality, but how she changes overtime from seeing the illusions and the things she has to do on the film set that start to affect the way she sees herself and whether anything is real anymore. You feel really sorry for her as the film progresses and the stuff she goes through.\
Me-Mania is that villain, who can terrify you just by looking at him. He actually doesn't do all that much, but that's what makes him so scary we don't know what he'll do next to torment Mima making him such a terrifying character.\
Art (10/10)\
Madhouse has always been amazing at creating anime artstyles and this is no different, just looking at the detailing of Mima's room was a really cool spectacle and the lighting of specific shots like when Mima is murdering the photographer and just the many transition shots at a certain point when Mima's dementia was really getting out of hand was absolutely stunning to see, despite the mindfu*k you'd get from it.\
Sound (9/10)\
The soundtrack from what I remember was pretty good, it always hit the right notes whenever a tense or really creepy moment happened in the film, like when Mima finally confronts Me-Mania and other certain moments that touched on darker elements.\
Extras:\
When it comes to the Psychological and Dementia aspects, Perfect Blue is probably the best example of these genres, because it nailed them perfectly. Seeing the way Mima's character getting affected by people and events around really showed how it took over her mind and made it seem like everything wasn't real anymore to her. It also shows that the career she has taken isn't as glamorous as she thinks, there are moments that really show the dark side of being an actress, like when a fake rape scene was being filmed and when she had to take photos fully nude would obviously affect a persons mental status.\
Now when it comes to the Horror element, the show did it very well with Me-Mania'character, he would always be in a random place within Mima's viewpoint and he wouldn't do anything. He would just smile and disappear which is creepy as hell and made you fear for Mima's life, because you would never know when this dude would pop up again or when he would finally strike.\
Enjoyment (10/10)\
Overall (10/10)\
Overall this was a brilliant film showing the harshness of being an actress and how someone trying to impersonate you can affect your sense of reality.\

    I decided to write a review for this Satoshi Kon's movie with hope that maybe it will encourage someone to see this great movie.\
Story 9/10\
 The story,even though it maybe seems familiar(psychological thriller where you can't distinguish real or fake anymore) it is not like the others you've seen before. In a matter of fact,lots of american movies have been inspired by this movie (such as Requiem for a dream and Black swan). While watching,Perfect blue will pull you in with its intense plot, heart-stopping moments and dreamy atmosphere.\
Art 8/10\
Given that the movie is from the 90's you can expect a little old fashion design,\
          \
        but given the low budget, I must say they did an excellent job.\
Character 10/10\
This is the reason why this movie is such a success. The psychological state of main character is so well written and directed that you will feel like you are losing your mind yourself while watching this movie. \
So overall i give it a strong 8 and warmly recommendation.\

    In this review I’ll talk about Satoshi kon’s debut, Perfect Blue\
About the plot it starts with a fine narrative way showing the event after another logically till before the end when the syndrome becomes complicated because of her friend is falling deep to the illness, there is no logic here it is just reality and fantasy are merging and Mima is just struggling through this dilemma facing her, while she can't decide what's real and what's not.\
The protagonist Mima has a psychological syndrome called Folie à deux or shared psychotic disorder in which two people share the same delusional belief and hallucinations. She decided to\
          \
        leave singing behind and start acting and she had a role with so much development and that development is reflecting the OC development of course and the development was amazing, she was an innocent shy singer in a small band and by the movie end she became able to act freely in a rape scene.\
The nudity scene serves the character development and presented the controversy around those kind of things in the society through the differences in the characters morality, it also was the trigger for the complication happened to her friend that leads to more development in the plot so for me it wasn’t fanservice although the scene hadn’t to be that exaggerated.\
Satoshi kon is known for bending reality and fiction in his movies like paprika and millennium actress but I didn't find it that great in this movie, it wasn’t well made so it affected the narration that could be more coherent.\
The writing was good after all, there is a fine plot and good character building.\
The cinematic approach was good in presenting the story to the screen and this complicated character, and I had to admit that there is some good work in the movie even it's just a good movie for me not that great as presenting the complicated syndrome that way will not result in a good plot with great narration and will make any one to overthink while watching and that will affect the watching experience badly for a motion pic art. But after all it is still acceptable.\
By the end, I will say that I liked the movie but not that much. \

    Serving as Satoshi Kon's directorial debut for an anime, Perfect Blue is a psychological thriller focused on pop idol turned actress Mima Kirigoe finding her career transition to be a rather horrific one as she finds herself suffering from apparent psychosis and dealing with a demented fan who is not exactly thrilled with her retirement as a pop idol.\
As a psychological thriller, Perfect Blue makes effective use of scene transitions and cuts to simulate Mima's apparent warped state of mind. The film transitions between different scenes of the drama TV series that Mima stars in and her actual life to mess with the viewer's perception\
          \
        of events, much in the same way Mima is experiencing. This makes for an effective use of cinematography as the film's plot features some horrific murders that take place throughout its run that keep viewers guessing throughout the film if Mima may have crossed the line with committing them or if her stalker did such. The film also makes for an effective mystery as despite its warped style of storytelling, hints are dropped about what is really going on and who is responsible for the murders that take place. When the ending unveils who is responsible for the murders and the stalking, everything comes into place rather smoothly if you  are able to follow the hints seen throughout the film and not be fooled with dealing with Mima's mental breakdown that the cinematography subjects you to.\
Outside of the thriller plot, Perfect Blue also paints a rather believable focus on the challenges and hardships that come into play with both being a pop idol and transitioning into being an actress. Unlike many anime that glamorize both professions where you become instantly famous and get to such a point easily with hard work, Perfect Blue shows off both as having their hardships and complications that can occur. Mima's old pop idol band, Cham, are clearly shown to be struggling to connect with audiences at the start of the film and struggle to find large venues to afford them the opportunity to connect with larger audiences. In addition, Mima's desire to transition from being a pop idol to an actress does not go over well with many of her fans and is a highly stressful one as she tries having bigger roles within the drama she stars in which crosses into more mature territory with its content than what she experienced as a pop idol. For anyone unaccustomed to the Japanese pop idol scene, many fans of this industry are known to have a preconceived image of purity that they tack on to the pop idols that they follow where they do not have boyfriends or take part in any sexually-driven roles. With her new acting career, Mima finds herself trying to distance herself from such notions to advance her career and this further alienates her from the fans that followed her since her time with Cham.\
Visually, Perfect Blue makes use of Satoshi Kon's realistic drawing style. Unlike many anime titles that normally make all their characters look visually attractive with the same-looking facial designs, Kon depicts a wider variety of facial designs and body types in the designs of his characters with realistic proportions applied to them. While not as heavily emphasized, the animation for the film is fluid for the most part with characters demonstrating natural movement without any noticeable shortcuts or loss of detail. \
As Satoshi Kon's first work, Perfect Blue is an excellent demonstration of many of the filming elements that would be found with Kon's later works with its cerebral cinematography and realistic drawing style. The film is an effective mystery-thriller that screws with the audience's perception of events taking place due to Mima's mental breakdown and the ongoing mystery of the string of murders taking place. Do be warned that the film is intended for mature audiences due to its intense violence, attempted rape scenes, intense language, and graphic nudity. Otherwise if you have the stomach to handle a mature psychological thriller, Perfect Blue is a highly recommended film to check out.\

    The first time I saw this film I didn't know what to think I knew it was good but other than that I was perplexed I wasn't familiar with Satoshi Kon's style so I just thought this was some crazy almost-horror movie. But on my second-time through I can confidently say that this is exactly how this film is supposed to make me feel: Strange, confused, and uneasy. To be honest, feelings I'm not used to experiencing especially while watching anime, I can't I like to feel happy with blue skies, not uncomfortable angles and dull tints over everything. I do like this film and\
          \
        the atmosphere it brings I just wanted to clarify my confusion.\
I do like this film a lot. I like Mima's character, the shots are genius, like the one of Uchida \"holding\" the Mima while she's on stage in the palm of his hand or when Cham's music is playing while Mima's doing the photo shoot. Speaking of that I like the music too, I'm into the pop idol music. Like most Satoshi Kon's work, I like the editing I like how the movies Mima acts in correlating to Mima's personal life it's genuinely creepy and makes the distinction from reality to fiction way harder, it's almost a predecessor to Millennium Actress. Speaking of that the scenes where Mima follows around 'other Mima' and the distinction from reality is like a predecessor to Paprika, though this is a lot less trippy.\
The film itself is about the duality between what people see and who you really are. I often tell people I know that everybody has a mask usually multiple masks some to show to friends some for family some for the internet and some just for yourself, sometimes we trade in and put on so many masks it's hard to know how we're supposed to act when we are by ourselves. This may sound like a bunch of armchair psychology/philosophy but I think about this kind of stuff a lot. Mima is a character who doesn't know how to deal with the constant switching of masks too fast and too often.\
What if you get too popular and there's one guy who's really into what you do and say and you have a sudden change? What'll happen? What's the difference between the people you know personally and talk to at school or work or at home and the people who you talk to online?\
Moral of the story don't trust anyone, don't tell anyone anything, internet friends aren't real friends and an internet job is not a real job. Art is a lie, nothing is real.\

    Studio Madhouse plus creative mind twisting director Satoshi Kon equals an anime guaranteed to at least create an environment of beauty, imagination, and where the viewer must pay attention. This anime has everything an avid anime fan and even a film fans fall over for ranging from the psychological to thriller with one of the best stories ever put on a big screen. When it comes separating reality from paranoia, it is hard to find something done better than Perfect Blue.\
Our main character is Mima Kirgoe, whom decided to leave her top star power as a member of an idol group to pursue greatness as\
          \
        an actress. Needless to say, some of her fans are less than thrilled about it. So much so, that one particular fan becomes a stalker on a level close to pure madness. As Mima continues her acting career and even taking on some questionable roles that her manager even disapproves of, mysterious murders start happening around those close to her. Slowly, Mima goes through psychological trauma and begins to have difficulty distinguishing her own fantasy from reality.\
The storytelling and characters shine on all levels from beginning to end. It is a blend of showing the viewer everything and nothing at the same time as the film progresses. This ranges from the smooth detailed animation showcasing particular suspense scenes switch between Mima’s psychological states at the time, all the way to details in the environment going on around her. The audience is given an experience of Mima slowly regressing into crazy paranoid delusions leading to amazing questions such as: What’s real? Is this a nightmare? What’s the difference in acting and normality? Basically, the progression of Mima and her delusions are done so well, the viewer becomes paranoid right there with her.\
When it comes to Perfect Blue, everything is done to the point of perfection. This is a “trip” to say the least, and any fan of Satoshi Kon, fan of great storytelling, fan of anime must find a way to watch this film at all costs.\

Story (no spoilers!)\
The story is about Mima Kirigoe, a Japanese pop-star who want's to become an actor. She leaves her band CHAM to become successful in a crime series. However the series doesn't work out that well and her ex-band gets more and more success. In the middle of this she finds out about a stalker who updates about everything she does on a special site called Mia's room. Then she starts having hallucinations.\
After this the story takes a few very nice plot turns, but I won't spoil them\
          \
        for you.\
The story is very strong. It leaves a big impact on you. It's not what you expect from your average anime, but that's for the better. The hallucinations work really well in this movie, however it also causes some minor flaws in the story. There are 2 main complaints I have about the story. First off, the hallucinations get really weird. With the hallucinations going on, and the shootings of the scene's it sometimes becomes kind off hard to follow, and really hard to understand what is real and what is just in her mind. However one might argue that this is for the better. On one hand it does surely increase the impact and strength of the story, and the neat thing about it is that it doesn't really destroy any reality of the story which is a nice achievement. However I think they went a bit over the top with it. Secondly, I feel that the character development on Mina herself is not enough. The build-up to the climax is really neat, however the conflict starts off to early. To summarise it, we never really get to know the \"normal\" Mina. Overall however, I would not say that this destroys the story. Once you're sucked into the story (for me around the 20 minute mark) the build-up doesn't form a problem any more, and as long as you pay close attention, you'll understand what's going on (at least you'll understand what you're supposed to understand).\
Also I wished the story would have stopped 10 minutes earlier. I don't want to spoil anything, but to be fair the story doesn't end open enough for me.\
Visuals.\
the visuals are stunning. for today's standards they would already be al right, and for back then, the visuals where just awesome. The more action-full and gory scene's are drawn beautifully.\
Voice Acting (DUB!)\
The voice acting of this dub is great. The real\
Mima (Ruby Marlowe) doesn't have an emotionless voice (as some voice actors are nowadays struggling with) in the hallucinations, she sounds extremely happy which adds to the scariness. Also, most of the side characters have good voices, no voice actor stands out, and neither does anyone really sound bad.\
Music.\
The music is alright, there is not to much of it and generally it does not add to much to the story. I did not really like the music Mima's band played, however that's really a matter of opinion. However the music does have a few very, very neat moments, especially in the scary parts where you hear these sound which really build up a lot of tension.\
Re-watch Value.\
The re-watch value of this story is decent but not great. A lot of the story rests on it's hallucination and mystery. In a normal story this would destroy the replay value. however because this story is pretty strong, you surely want to watch it again after a few months.\
Verdict.\
This movie is a must see to every anime fan. The story might (at least with me it did) leave an impression which will not go away very soon.\
Furthermore, this movie is one you want to show to open minded friends who do not like anime (because they have a stereotypical view of it). This film is especially a recommendation to all the people who liked ''A beautiful mind'' and ''Psycho''.\

    When I sat down to watch Perfect Blue, I was definitely excited. My all-time favourite movie is Black Swan, and I have heard any number of comparisons between the two.  So from the outset I was interested, and I can say I was fully satisfied after watching it. Perfect Blue is a fantastic animated movie and easily one of the best psychological thriller films I have ever seen, but a couple of minor things didn’t make it as good as it could have been.\
Story\
\9Mima Kirigoe is a pop-idol, part of the j-pop group CHAM! However, to the dismay of many of her fans, she\
          \
        has decided to leave that part of her life behind her and make become an actress. Her first role is in a TV. show called “Double Bind”, a psychological drama series. As she makes her transition, she discovers her former band members are having more and more success while Mima is struggling. Eventually she discovers a website called ‘Mima’s Room’ which recalls the intimate details of her life. She turns to her manager Rumi Hidaka, but is told to ignore the site. From this point her mental breakdown begins.\
\9The story is easily the standout part of the film for me. It is really well told and the scenes where you see Mima’s breakdown are pure brilliance. \
It is a pretty hard hitting story, and will leave you thinking by the end of it. From the very outset you get a great feel for the character Mima, and you want to see her do well. Her actual breakdown is also incredibly well done, as I said before and is probably the best part of the story. \
There are a few scenes that really stand out, especially when the hallucinations start playing with what Mima believes is real or not. This was pretty amazing to watch, although for some it will leave the film a little bit hard to follow. Also the scenes where Mima is running after the hallucination were very nicely done, and certainly help create the breakdown really well. Even the scene in the strip club was great (if a little bit protracted in my opinion) because it really helps build the character, and the tone for the rest of the film.\
I would love to mention more, but I would just be spoiling what happens, so I’ll stop on this subject now!\
\9The other characters aren’t quite as well developed in my opinion. Rumi is quite interesting, and is someone I would have liked to know more about because her role in the story is so important, and in the end I didn’t really understand how her story was actually resolved. Me-Mania was pretty well developed, and he made for a great character, but I think I would have liked to know more about him as well.\
\9This under-development in the characters leaves the ending feeling almost disjointed from the rest of the film. At first when I saw the resolution in sight, I was pretty excited. I thought I saw what was going on, but (and maybe this is actually a good thing) it turned out to be completely different to what I wanted. It left me thinking, okay it was a twist for the sake of having a twist. Saying that, I did like the ending, but it could have been better or possibly just could have been hinted at better.\
Visuals\
         The animation is top notch, all the movements are pretty fluent, and I think there was only one scene where someone’s arm moves in one of those fantastic ways without breaking. Apart from that I am fairly sure everything else was really nicely done.  By today’s standard it is pretty average, but definitely not bad.\
         The look of things like Mima’s apartment, or the city itself really helps build the atmosphere. The city seems over crowded, a place that makes you feel like you’re always been followed. On the other hand you have the apartment which is small and cosy; a haven from the outside. Yet once she starts receiving the emails, it seems like a prison, where the world watches her from the outside. These sort of visual aspects in the film really build the tone, and add that creepy atmosphere you need to make a psycho-thriller work.\
Sound\
\9I’m going to start with the voice acting now. I loved it. Mima’s voice actress Junko Iwao (Hikari Horaki in NGE, I believe and Tomoyo in Cardcaptor) does a superb job. She sounds sensitive, yet confident, but as her breakdown begins her voice almost becomes empty with emotion. All her lines are well delivered (especially those about the internet… which I thought were hilarious… Sad times before the internet) \
\9The rest of the character’s give great performances but Iwao does manage to outshine them all. I think the only voice that maybe wasn’t as great as it could have been was Me-Mania. His voice suited the role, but I was expecting something a lot different. Not a criticism by any means was just waiting for something different.\
\9The music was something that didn’t stand out to me for some reason. It didn’t take down the enjoyment of the film for me, considering I only notice the music when it is truly spectacular. I did actually like the songs CHAM! sing because I feel they suit the type of group they are, and in the elevator scene, I thought it was really damn cool. \
\9 I haven’t seen the dub yet, and I may try and update this review when I have. The rest of the sounds in the movie are great, everything helps build the atmosphere, which I really liked. All I can really say on that.\
Overall\
\9I gave good few criticisms, but I want to say now, it’s a fantastic movie. Highly recommend it, if you’re a fan of psycho-thrillers. The ending is a little jarring, but the story is solid, the voice acting great, and the characters believable (for the most part) I have read that the movies could have worked better as a live action movie, and I am inclined to agree. However I don’t think the scenes where Mima was chasing the hallucinations would have been as well done, and ended up just been a little bit silly. \
\9Overall Perfect Blue is a brilliant movie and really worth a watch. One of those movies that I think my dad would like, and he isn’t the biggest fan of animated movies unless they are Pixar! ",

    I can form only one reason why this movie is as underrated as it is. We, the viewer, are too afraid (or blind) to admit that we're exactly like the main character in this film. I can say this because when I first watched Perfect Blue I too thought it was just 'clever', a smart little psychological thriller for me, the 'smart' viewer. It's taken me another watch to realise how close a modern social comment this movie realy is. And I believe none have come as close. I've seen other shows with great little stories that I can get engrossed in, escape in and\
          \
        all that, but none that really comes as close to saying who I am(and I believe many other people are), as Perfect Blue. That's why it is truly terrifying.\
Mima, a pop star gone actor, lives for others, she is their play-thing. They are able to use her, because really she is nothing but what they've consructed her to be, as Mima so perfectly puts it 'excuse me, who are you?...excuse me, who are you?', whereas she really should be asking 'who am I?'. A question none of us can really answer, because we only know who we really are from what people tell us. Our only sense of identity is gained from those around us, others tell us who we truly are, because really we're just a patchwork of other people's personalities. For example, if you were to gather all the people that know you, they would be able to write a more accurate definition of you than you yourself could. Mima is a perfect example of this, she is everything that her fans wish her to be, she has to be or she'll no longer be worshipped, or even appreciated by the masses.\
    Satoshi Kon doesn't stop there, and that is what makes this a masterpiece, now that Mima has become an actor he has the chance to tear apart, while meticulously dissecting, the game we all act in our day to day lives. But none of us know it's all an act, an elabourate ruse where we buy new costumes regularly, reafirm who we are by acting how others think we should, and lose all sense of our real, proper self. It is when we try to find this real self that those closest to us, family or friends, get angry or dissapointed. Because we've broken away from the pigeon hole that they've placed us in, we have stopped being the person that is most able to help them, and become our own person. This is what I believe to be the reason behind Kon's murderous stalker theme, someone who you thought could never turn on you, who you thought wanted the best for you, is really just using you. This is what sends that chill down my spine, Perfect Blue so subtly defines people, yet most of us still continue our day to day lives, our conditioning and indoctrination has won out over reason. We continue to act.\
Perfect Blue isn't just a thriller about a murderous stalker, I see it also as an accurate depiction of people suffering under the current system and mode of thought. Satoshi Kon masterfully achieves this by reflecting us, the viewer, back at us by showing Mima a mirror image of herself. She is adored, worshipped, controlled, raped, hated, but worst of all, she is me.\

    What I enjoy about movies in the psychological/horror genre is how well the anime can mess with your mind. No matter how much attention you pay, you still end up getting confused as hell. And when you think you have something explained, the anime trips you over and makes you doubt everything you have thought was correct about the anime thus far. No wonder that the people of the internet have given this genre a more simpler name; Mindfuck. This type of anime storytelling is most associated with the great Satoshi Kon, and Perfect Blue was his first major work, and may I just say,\
          \
        what a hell of a way to make a debut.\
STORY \
The story is centred around Mima Kirigoe, a pop idol in a group called CHAM. She feels like her career as a singer has come to an end and she begins to pursue a career as an actress, which goes against the wishes of all of her fans. Although it starts well for Mima, things quickly turn to a nightmare after filming a certain...”scene” and a nude photoshoot. \
Weird phone calls, death threats, stalking, murder...These all pile up on Mima causing her to have a warped view on reality, and becomes unable to distinguish her nightmares from her reality.\
Perfect Blue is one of those titles that don’t give a fuck about their audience. If you feel disgusted, the film will disgust and disturb you more. It discusses certain topics that hardly any titles have.\
What I loved about the movie was just how confusing it can get. The confusion adds to the enjoyment because it feels as if we’re thrown directly into the nightmare that is the world of Perfect Blue.\
CHARACTERS\
All of the characters in the movie are believable, to a terrifying extent. Character development is one of the best I’ve ever seen when it comes to the main protagonist. Mima is developed in such a way that you end up sharing her fear and paranoia, and her merging of reality and fantasy is what makes this movie so awesome. The stalker is shown in such a way that reflects the desires of someone obsessed with an idol, to a point where a sense of ownership can be felt. This was a great move by Kon, as this REALLY does happen to pop idols, especially in Japan.\
ANIMATION & SOUND\
The animation is one of the best I’ve ever seen. The animation style is your typical late 90’s Madhouse, very fluid and quite realistic. What makes the animation shine, is HOW the animation is used. Colour use is especially noteworthy as bright colours are combined with the dark shades in very disturbing scenes, to create that sense of paranoia and horror. It’s difficult to explain, (as is the ENTIRE film) you just need to see it for yourself. Character designs are also really good, especially the stalker. His facial features literally represent the creepiness of an obsessed stalker, mainly the look of death in his eyes...\
The soundtrack is bloody awesome. Half of it consists of 1990’s pop music, which I have a thing for, and the other half... well, it has some of the creepiest music of all time when combined with the movie. The most notable is the track called “Virtual Mima”, which is in my opinion, the creepiest anime OST track I’ve ever heard. (There is also a vocal only version too)\
I watched the movie in Japanese dub. There is an English dub also, but I don’t want to go into that, because the Japanese dub is absolutely awesome. Mima’s hysterical screams of fear are so extreme to the point where they feel genuine. It just boosts up the creepiness of the movie to a very high level. Remember the “Laugh” from the Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni franchise? Yeah this has a very similar effect. Seriously, Perfect Blue has one of the best Japanese dubs I’ve heard in a long time.\
FINAL EVALUATION\
So...just what is Perfect Blue?\
The amount of themes and topics this movie brings up makes that question almost impossible to answer...\
Fear, paranoia, feminism, greed for fame, loss of innocence, vulnerability of private lives, hallucinations, reality and fantasy, insanity, the media, loss of fame... \
Perfect Blue is extremely complex, and is almost impossible to explain after just one viewing. It’s one of those rare movies that you must see twice or maybe even three times to understand its logic. Unfortunately, the complexity of the film is often the only reason why people turn this down, and dismiss it, using the excuse that it “makes no sense” without ever trying to comprehend what this movie is about, and that’s really a shame. It’s just one of those movies where you really need to think hard.\
For once, I strongly recommend younger viewers to pay attention to the age rating. R-rated, 17+, this film is seriously unsuitable for a younger audience. I’m serious, this is the first time in my anime-watching history that I advise you to stay away if you’re “underage”, as it’s just messed up. Like I said, the movie doesn’t give a fuck. On-screen rape, bloody violence, full nudity, it’s all there, and for once, it feels incredibly realistic.\
The ending may be a bit off in terms of pacing, but it is satisfactory as it lets all of the pieces fall into place.\
10/10. \
The surreal atmosphere combined with the extremeness of the plot and its themes make for a great masterpiece, even if it’s just 1 hour and 20 minutes long...\
Why SHOULD you watch Perfect Blue?\
- Fantastic plot\
- It’s a Satoshi Kon movie...\
- Very extreme in presentation (doesn’t give a damn about audience)\
- Realistic, convincing and well-animated characters \
- Amazing animation (style and technique)\
- Brilliant Jap.dub \
- Spectacular soundtrack\
- Very complex\
Why should you NOT watch Perfect Blue?\
- if you’re not mature enough.\
- if you don’t like titles where you need to think hard.\
- if you HATE 90’s animation styles. (like seriously hate it.)",

    Perfect Blue is a visionary tale which any true anime fan should add to their to-watch list immediately.  It was produced in 1997, which makes me wonder why I'd never heard of it before, but it's withstood the test of time very well.  The art, predictably, is a bit dated, but it does not detract from the enjoyment for me at all.\
This anime is basically a psychological thriller, and should never be viewed by children under any circumstances.  It contains violence, exploitation, and sexual abuse.  I've seen a lot of disturbing anime, but this is definitely near the top, with scenes\
          \
        that made me want to throw up, punch my monitor, or simply look away.  The beauty of Perfect Blue, though, is that you can never being yourself to look away.\
The plot starts out innocently enough, but quickly becomes quite confusing.  The main character is a pop idol-turned-actress with delusions of being a killer, starring in a drama series about a killer who has delusions of being a pop idol-turned-actress, who stars in a...AHHH!  Nevermind, suffice to say you will have no idea what the hell is going on until the final scene.  Even now, I am still thinking back to what was fantasy and what was reality.  Plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing.\
Complaints: The craziness level was a bit much, even for me, but such ambition definitely deserves praise.  My biggest problem was with the very very last scene before the credits roll, which seems so out-of-place with the events leading up to it.  It pulled me right out of the immersion.  I'm going to pretend that scene never existed and give this outstanding work a 9.\

    Never before have I seen such an intricate plot peppered with the epitome of psychological horror, slasher, mystery, inherent drama, and a straight up head-twist cinematography. This film has redefined how I think of films; and I thought The Machinist and The Sixth Sense were trippy. I felt the urge to rewatch film immediately after watching the Machinist, due to a similar motif of \"Who Are You?\" \
This film is very deceptive, though it is from the initial seemingly pop anime that it branches into an extremely complex, intellectually mind bending film dealing with such themes as identity, reality and dreams: These are but a\
          \
        few of a plethora ripe for the picking.\
Perfect Blue is a film that I strongly wish for everyone who enjoys any of the above listed genres to watch. The production values, script, characterizations, overall presentation, and incredible plot twist(s) make this film remarkable, memorable, and so very unique that it practically redefines the genre of psychological horror. It is horror in the intellectual sense, rather than a generic, extreme psychopath who resorts to violence as is the common idiosyncrasy within slasher films these days. I have nothing against them- I just sometimes like to watch a film that challenges my intellect.\
The nudity, while may be a bit much for some people's taste, serves well amongst the use of juxtaposition in a specific scene. While movies pertaining to delusions and protagonists getting reality mixed and confused with dreams - i.e. unable to differentiate between the two - may seem a bit cliché to those who are well versed in psychological drama, the presentation and characterization make this just amazing. A stand alone classic, up there with Psycho by acclaimed director Alfred Hitchcock.\
What made me watch this back when it was first released in America was the premise and genre, and I had actually thought little of it. However, upon watching it for a third time, I was more confused though more enmeshed- The very use of foreshadowing, literal juxtapositions with the T.V. killer drama mystery and the actual killer drama mystery that is the film Perfect Blue is all so clever and brilliantly executed. \
Unfortunately though, with the X amount of times I have seen this film, there are many elements that are still confusing, like loose ends of a rope that are never tied; and it is understandable from some critics why the end is sort of a cop out. Regardless, if you feel like watching an extremely unorthodox anime, then by all means, check this one out.\

    While I know a majority of the people enjoyed watching this and I acknowledge that in the end I don't find this genre particularly to my taste, I think an opposing review might be helpful.\
I highly disliked this film.\
It was around the beginning of my middling anime watching experience.  I have watched a range of others before it - Sailormoon, Rurouni Kenshin, X-1999, Eva, Magic Knight Rayearth, etc. - and at the time I thought this would have been interesting change of pace, considering the rave reviews it got, online and off.  However, when I watched it, it did not please me.\
Okay, first\
          \
        things first.  The art is very good for its time and realistic.  I don't particularly enjoy this particular style but I do acknowledge it is done with skill and suit the subject matter.  However, some scenes became all the more sickening, in a mental way, and made the film feel harsher to me as a viewer because of the style used.  The music was alright, I took no pleasure in it but it added to the mood and was suspenseful when it was supposed to be and gripping when it needed it.  The story was decent, except that it was highly convoluted and the subject matters it took on were difficult and did not allow me to enjoy any element of it.\
The characters, to me, were not accessible and hard to sympathize with.  Or you sympathize but it's just painful.  Their actions and the actions of the general ppl in the story were constantly brutal, usually with blatant sexual violence, but it was fairly one-sided, leaving me with no room to describe the experience with \"enjoy\" or \"like\".  I also did not like how loneliness became shameful and criminal, and seemed to be a theme that had no other dimension... maybe delusional... but nothing that just is.  Everyone get lonely, I don't understand how EVERYONE becomes warped by this isolation.  It's like the movie is crying out that isolation, from society and others, will always lead to the path of deviants.  At least, this is the impression I get from it since the clearest recall I have of this all lead to some form of eventual criminal deeds.  The story was also convoluted enough and the characters were shown in such a way that I only felt I was taking bad things from it because it only had bad things to give.  I can see the darkness in society but it was almost like the world was devoid of any goodness and decency, or at least, it is so overshadowed by falsehood and madness that it can't be counted on to be real.  When I think on this anime I only vividly remember the terrible sexual violence, the humiliation and fear of the main character and the villains.  These are not things I want to take away from anything I watch but these are the ONLY things I feel I took away from this film, at least they overshadowed all else.\
The main character only resounds with me at the ending act, but fails to connect me to her throughout the movie as a shining light and more as a constant victim that struggled... somewhere that doesn't feel like triumph and isn't exactly defeat.  I don't enjoy watching an entire movie about someone who is defined by the entire show as a victim, and while some people may feel she overcame her obstacles, I did not feel that way at the end of it.  \
Was it a well done anime?  Visually, yes.  But did I enjoy it in any way, no.  I can only think on this anime and say I really hated watching it.  I don't mean it bored me, I mean I disliked the characters and were genuinely disgusted at points in the story, I did not enjoy the story in any way, and in the end, it just leaves a bad impression in my mind as a whole.\
I would not watch or recommend this anime.  It is a singular opinion, but I did not feel that the marriage of crime to surrealism in this case worked for me in anyway.  And well I can stomach violence and human folly, this one was the entirely wrong mixture for me to like or even feel tolerably toward.\
I gave it a 3, on the merit that it was well made but having seen it and processed it, I did not in any way enjoy the story it had to tell or the way it was told.\

    I once read \"Perfect Blue\" described as \"Hitchcock does Anime\", which is a dead-on descriptor for this film.\
Satoshi Kon has made four films in the past decade, all quite loved. Besides this one they include Paprika, Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers (he was also the creative force behind the television series Paranoia Agent). Perfect Blue was the only feature I had not seen before, so I watched it in memoriam and also because I loved all of his other works .\
Satoshi Kon's films often have mind bending, ambitious narrative structures, but this trend started with \"Perfect Blue\", his first feature. An examination of identity, celebrity,\
          \
        sexism, alienation and exploitation under patriarchy, the film revolves around Mima, a pop-singer who leaves her pop band, CHAM, to begin a career as an actress. But as Mima is forced into racier material, the film's narrative begins to break down, points-of-view, dreams, nightmares and private delusions overlapping and co-mingling. Are we witnessing a nervous breakdown induced by a deeply disturbing culture, or perhaps something more? \
Perfect Blue will probably confuse you, and the ending will leave you thinking, but in these days of neat, clean-edged storytelling, a little confusion is good for the soul.\
This one paragraph contains some spoilers and analysis : The film's blending at least four points of view. You have Mima, a young woman who so craves fame and celebrity that she's willing to sell her body and submit to all manners of consented debasement. Then you have the fans, particularly one deranged fan, who sees Mima as his product, his fantasy object which he must both control and defend. This fan obsessively tracks the details of Mima's daily life and reacts violently when outside sources try to change her image. Then you have men, always leering with cameras, eyes or controlling via chequebooks and ink pens; the vast moral abyss of a phallocentric entertainment industry. Finally, you have women, in particular one woman, a chubby, motherly woman who seems like a caretaker but reveals herself to be a killer who pines for her lost youth and beauty; she pits herself against Mima in a fit of rage and jealousy. Significantly, Mima attempts to spare the life of this woman, a gesture which positions us to sympathize with the caretaker. She too is a victim, a pawn in a battle which pits sister against sister, the result of a culture which demands conformity, perfection, submission, bows to the tyranny of the image and is obsessed with a form of feminine perfection which, at its worst, leads to mental instability and collapse.\
The rights to \"Perfect Blue\" were bought by Darren Aronofsky, who cribbed some of its shots, scenes, ideas and themes for 2010's \"Black Swan\" (he changes Mima's name to Nina, makes her a ballet dancer and even uses some of Mima's scenes in his earlier film, \"Requiem For a Dream\"). Lynch's \"Mulholland Drive\" is also very similar. Both Lynch and Satoshi posit women as victims of a male dominated culture, though, whilst Aronofsky's film casts women as its chief villains, and largely lets its victimizers (and us) off scott-free.\
Aesthetically, \"Perfect Blue\" is the darkest of Satoshi's features. His palette is all dark blues and inky blacks, his Japan one of tiny cubicles and deeply alienated urbanites, and most of his characters are vile and perverted. Doubles and doppelgangers also feature throughout. Characters named Rumi and Mima are paired, for example, both names meaning \"beautiful\" in Japanese. The film's stiffer and has a lower frame rate than modern anime, which may put some viewers off. It was nevertheless somewhat ahead of its time, and remains one of the best anime's of the mid 90's.\

    Satoshi Kon has always found a way to mess with his audiences mind. His 1997 psychological thriller PERFECT BLUE may be his zaniest ever. A pop idol turns actress, starting from the bottom she plays small bits in crime films. But she soon discovers that there is an online website dedicated to her called \"Miamis Room\" and Miami soon discovers that she is being stalked by a crazed fan who hates the idea of her leaving the music scene. \
When the psychological stuff starts happening its like a bad dream come true. Kon plays out different situations that have different results, but then comes right\
          \
        back to the beginning and starts it all over again. Until we can't figure out what's real and whats imaginary. This technique, that has been done many times before, never felt so unsettling or nerve racking. I think that its because its a cartoon everything that is happening to her seems more sinister because cartoons have the ability to break the fourth wall and I was wondering exactly what Kon would do with his characters. Outside the floating dancer that follows Miami, PERFECT BLUE is pretty grounded in terms of reality, the murders, the fame, or how fans can have certain reactions to what their idols do is all too real. A lot of these celebrity's know that some fans go to far and can be extremely dangerous at times, I think this is what makes PERFECT BLUE so good and so effective. \
The stalker in this film is beyond creeper, not just his mannerisms, but how they chose to draw him and how evil he actually looks. I wont spoil the ending of course but everything comes together and it actually makes more sense then what we thought was actually happening. You just got to remember who to trust with your career and how if its in the wrong hands can be twisted and manipulated to the point that you have no control. PERFECT BLUE brings up some scary issues, like how the internet can effect your life as well, which made it more realistic and so much more enjoyable for me. Definitely a top favorite anime feature.\

    Once I had a dream of being a TV personality, then I watched this anime.\
I won't tell you what happened to my dream (since you can already guess what happened), but first I like to commend this anime for it's nice way of expressing the dark story line to the viewer. The things that make this anime unique from other anime with serious topics in my opinion, is that the way the anime control it's story line and how the characters interact in their given situations.\
The characters here are the real thing. One thing when I watch a horror/dark anime is I make sure I\
          \
        can feel the fears, worries, despair, and hardships of the characters in the anime. In the anime, you can easily grasp those emotions from the characters, making it traumatic. The feelings of despair, the fears, the worries are well expressed by the characters making it easy to understand by the viewers how the character actually feels. The actions of the characters are reasonable based on their given situations and conditions, which makes the anime realistic in when you try to think about it. You will be traumatized in a good way after you watched this anime.  I really recommend this anime, if you like to experience the intense feelings of despair experienced by the characters and if you like to experience how traumatic the world the characters live in.\
I find the story line of the anime creative. The rhythm of the plot is great. You can see how the story intensifies as the anime continues. All I did as I watch the anime is open my mouth and ask \"what the hell is happening\". One thing I like about this anime is how the plot twists intensify the story. Most of the time, plot twists in general is very crucial since instead of putting the anime to a higher level, it degrades the anime itself. I like to commend this anime for pulling off awesome plot twists, which makes it more interesting as it goes, until it ends to one great resolution.\
This anime is a must-watch if you like idols, traumatic plots, weird art, plot twists and of course dark themes. If your dream is becoming a TV popstar or an awesome idol shown in the television, don't watch this anime. Thumbs up for this anime. \

    Who are you? That ubiquitous question is everywhere in our lives. Are we the joker, the slacker, the jock, the nerd, the hipster, or are we even any of those things? Does it even matter what we think? Maybe the people around us know more about who we are than we do ourselves. With these questions in mind Perfect Blue takes us on a journey. Not a literal journey, but a journey within a certain Mima Kirigoe.\
The film begins this journey right after Mima decides to quit her job as a singer. She has been a singer with a group called “CHAM!” for a couple\
          \
        years with no real success. After deciding that she has no future as a singer, she starts a new career as an actress and quit “CHAM!”. This shift in her career makes quite a few ripples in her life. Her fans are angry and want her back as a singer, she’s afraid someone is stalking her, there is enormous pressure on her to succeed as an actress, and to make matters worse the TV show she’s acting in wants her to do a horrifying rape scene.\
Mima is so confused and scared that she doesn’t know anything about herself anymore. She has been split in two. There’s Mima the pop singer and there’s Mima the actress. Everyone has their own idea of which one she is, but she is at a complete loss, thrown into confusion by the various pressures around her. She finds a website online called Mima’s Room, an insanely detailed blog that writes about her daily life as Mima. The Mima found in this blog hates acting and rejects everything the real Mima is doing. Mima’s strained metal state leads her to believe that this version of her might just be the real Mima. Maybe the person writing Mima’s Room knows more about her than she does. She is left disoriented and unable to tell which one is real and which one is fake.\
The way Perfect Blue captures that internal struggle is the key to its success. Satoshi Kon gives us an eye into Mima’s mind. Everything she goes through we go through. From the trauma of acting in a brutal rape scene to the self-doubt and total confusion that Mima feels throughout the film. By using disorienting cuts, dream sequences, and constant red herrings, the audience never gets a full grasp of what’s going on. Satoshi Kon keeps us as paranoid and in the dark as Mima is throughout the film.\
There are few films that I feel so utterly taken over by. Where the movie ends and I find myself questioning everything around me. I just have to walk around and just think. Think about what I had gone through and what it meant. This movie did that for me. I left this place and entered another entirely. I entered Mima’s head and had come back with something. I can’t say that happens very often. Sure, I see a lot of great movies and some even move me, but I can’t say they ever take me where Perfect Blue took me. In an age where everyone seems to be racing for the most shocking thing they can think of, something that can make you ask yourself questions and leave you with something is truly precious.\

    I've done a lot of reviews for horror anime recently, but Perfect Blue has one major factor that sets it apart from Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, 3x3 Eyes and Mermaid's Scar. It's actually scary. The other three weren't bad, two of them were even good, but they focused more on action sequences than building up suspense and horror. In their case the horror label was more of a tag saying \"includes monsters\" than an actual genre statement.\
I can't give away too much of the plot without going into spoilers, but the basic setup is that a pop singer named Mima Kirigoe decides to transition into\
          \
        acting and give up her singing career. While working on a television drama she takes several risque steps to strengthen her image as an actress, but things around her start going wrong. People start getting injured and dying and the centre of the action seems to be her. The main focus is on Mima, who begins to go through increasing psychological trauma as a result of the events around her. To make the situation worse, she finds a website that portrays her life in a frighteningly accurate way. There are two major reasons the horror in this film works. The first is that it's very psychological. It forces you into the mindset of the protagonist and doing so enables it to get increasingly jumbled and challenging. The result is that it leaves the viewer confused and uncertain of what to expect. The second reason that it works is because it's realistic. You don't get a visual of clearly fictitious monsters fighting heroes. Instead you get an antagonist who's very human performing deeds that could easily happen in reality, and have to an extent. \
The characters are like everyday people. All of them seem very real and this really helps the tone and maintains the realism. This actually makes the ending pretty spectacular since, when you finally know what's happening, it all makes perfect sense and seems even more like something that could happen. \
The art is a little dated but it has a superb atmosphere. The characters, background and so on all create a perfect atmosphere for the story. They present some very frightening imagery as well. There's even one scene that's so well drawn that, due to the content of the scene, it's hard to watch. Now that takes skill. \
The voice work is spectacular as well. The dialogue is all delivered in a very natural way and it just makes the atmosphere that much better. Iwao Junko is brilliant in the role of Mima and all the secondary voice actors play their parts very well too.\
The yuri factor is a 1/10. There's no yuri. Which is really for the best since any romance would be out of place. \
My final rating for Perfect Blue is a perfect 10/10. This is a spectacular movie. All the elements coalesce to create a whole that's awe-inspiring, creepy and yes, even frightening. If you're a fan of horror movies it's a must see. \

    Satoshi Kon's first film, Perfect Blue begins almost as a light story, narrating the new life of Mima, stopping his maiden career of pop singer adulated to embark on an actress, and finally plunges the viewer into a sordid history and disturbing. \
If a strictly graphic Perfect Blue perspective showing its age, (especially when you saw Paprika seven years younger two days before) with an animation to the economy which sometimes limits the immersion, it is remarkable schizophrenic thriller on all other points. Characters, editing, tempo in the narration of an implacable crescendo... \
The great strength of Perfect Blue is to make us literally feel\
          \
        the agony of his heroine who does not know where to locate its reality, separate memories illusions, past and present. Juggling falsely with similar plans, intersecting ellipses, redundant replicas, Satoshi Kon leads the viewer through a labyrinth where he no longer has any tangible outlet to which cling to judge the veracity of Mima's life, always pushing more in his hallucinations. In fact, over the coach, Satoshi Kon, a multiplicity of effects as sober effective, involves the viewer in the narrative. omnipotent stalker, it is to him to define the reality in which lives Mima. \
Although the lack of outcome can be foolish tip relative to the whole story, there is still frankly upside in Perfect Blue, not so much because of the potential node to the brain that could provide, but because of have dabbled with the tip of the pupil that can be destructive power of madness and feeling vaguely guilty about what happened to heroin.\

    I was around 11 years old at the time, i saw Perfect Blue in a store and became intrigued from the graphical side of things, 'dont judge a book by it's cover' was the oppisite for me. The cover of the VHS tape showed Mima lying down on some flowers with one strap of her promiscious top over her shoulder.I had noticed this anime before, and i think before seeing the tape, i had seen a AMV. I looked on the back of the cover and it showed cham, in these cute pink lolitaish styled dresses, with white knee high socks and red chunky heels.\
          \
        I think what can capture some girls with anime is the 'prettyness' and fenimisity it holds, i read it was about a popstar then wanted to buy it immediantly.  When i saw it was an 18, i got my dad to buy it for me, after i had watched it i was left bored and confused and pondering what it was all about. The first time watching it however, i wasnt really focusing and afterwards i just kept rewinding the video back to the beggining when cham sing 'ai no tenshi'. I have this song on my iPod now and am very pleased! Overall, my rating is 'masterpeice', because it's just such a classic and when you first watch it you loose track of whats real and whats reality. Mima is haunted by the past of her life as a popstar when she chooses a career of an actress, she seems to become dellusional and feel guilty and maybe even a little scisophrenic. She starts posing naked for magazines, and in a film, plays a stripper who gets raped. Perfect Blue is quite circuitous and complicated but a must see and everybody understands it eventually 8D\

    Perfect Blue is a dark and mysterious psychological thriller. It feels like a Hollywood film directed by a famous director. A small concern however, is the storyline; it sucks. I didn't even bother watching it for the story. It is much less of a  concern as much of what makes this movie great is the artwork. Visuals are sharp and detailed, the backgrounds are gorgeous, the characters feel lifelike and are very deep, and the voice actors are A+ grade. Additionally, breasts bounce like how they are supposed to, the nipples are drawn with precision, and the sex scenes are just absolutely amazing. The\
          \
        voice actresses moaning to the beat of the pounding is one of the best points of this film. I can't recall how many times I've jerked off to this hentai.\

    Critic’s Log - Earthdate: October 24, 2013. Review #63: Perfect Blue\
\
Ah, Satoshi Kon. Ever since his death on August of 2010, he has left viewers with some interesting films and his only TV series. Now I usually treat Anime movies the same way as a Television Anime. I know that Anime films have larger budgets than TV animes, so there are some strong advantages to Anime films regarding this. I am also a man that takes movies seriously, and I will say the same thing towards anime. As silly as that sounds, my main goal since the beginning was to put out honest and informative\
          \
        reviews, as well as voicing my opinion as perfectly honest as possible. But I guess the biggest question of all regarding reviewing anime is… how long and how much is “too far”. Well.... not everybody can be pleased. There will always be arguments and disputes on most things. Some people agree on one thing and others may disagree. That’s just how things go in the matter of any entertainment medium. So before I start spouting things out of the blue, Here is Perfect Blue.\
\
Mima is the lead singer of a J-pop group named “CHAM!” quits her group in order to pursue an acting career, However, because of her decision to leave, not everyone is happy. but unbeknownst to Mima, there is a crazed fan that is stalking her. The following events become more unsettling and turn for the worse and Mima is on the verge of going toward a downward spiral.\
To be technical, this is a Studio Madhouse production and boy, am I going to sound like a broken record but… Madhouse is known for great production values, and they do not disappoint with Perfect Blue. However, I can’t say the animation isn’t really as good as it gets since the character designs are slightly off in some moments, with the exception of Uchida (Mima’s stalker) and Rumi (Mima’s manager). The stalker’s appearance does help with the uneasiness and it helps you relate to Mima in the movie, as for Rumi, I thought her character design was a bit off because of how her eyes looked. I actually will give this movie a pass for this. If you have not seen the movie yet, I will say that the less you know the better. To those that have seen it, please do not give it away. Besides Uchida and Rumi, the character designs are still a little off. But to give Kon-san some credit, this is his first movie as a director and he does impress with this movie.\
The music by Masahiro Ikumi does fit the eerie and chilling atmosphere but it is certainly an interesting factor in the film. There isn’t much musical themes in this movie and there are a couple themes that may be used more than once, but there are times when there is no music at all. This is an effective factor because it may build some uneasiness during the experience in the movie. I do wonder why Ikumi-san doesn’t do much musical compositions in Anime, this is undoubtedly his best musical score.\
In regards of the casting, Junko Iwao is great as Mima, Rica Matsumoto is also good as Rumi. Masaki Okura is pretty decent as Uchida. The Japanese Cast is a solid listen, now when it comes to the English Dub, I was expecting a decent dub. I almost guessed this right, but I was actually wrong. In reality, The dub is a solid listen as well… but the dub is a little off in some areas. What the dub has is a terrific performance by Bridget Hoffman as the voice of Mima. Also, Wendee Lee was great in this one too. R. Martin Klein was a little off in this movie, but the dub is still a solid listen.\
When it comes to characters. Mima is pretty much the main attraction in the movie and you do want to pay attention to her along the way, but regardless of that. This movie is very tricky while portraying Mima but she is developed well after all the things that happen. She may be the least complex character of the bunch, but she does give the viewer the sense that she is normal… Which makes the movie more effective. The movie does portray her as being stressed considering all the events that transpire. Rumi may not be too active in this movie, and that’s pretty much it, but she’s developed decently. Uchida is a weird dude and there’s a point to this. It’s fitting because he is a stalker, His face is odd and that I guess is what makes him memorable. All the other supporting characters are like normal people, so I don’t have much to say. The characters are pretty good for the most part.\
As for the story, I am going to have to stop right here… Because If I said anymore, it will just ruin it for you. Once you heard about the premise, you may want to figure things out for yourself. I will say that this movie definitely does have appeal for those that are really into Alfred Hitchcock’s films. I will say just one thing about the story for those that haven’t seen Perfect Blue. The less you know...The Better.\

Perfect Blue was available by Manga Entertainment, it is out of print.\
\
With all that said, Perfect Blue is a film that managed to stand out as Satoshi Kon’s debut film. The animation is good, the story is interesting that you would probably want to see it to figure things out, it even has some characters worth paying attention to, and it has a soundtrack that compliments the movie to some extent. This movie was just the beginning of seeing the visionary style that made Satoshi Kon unique.\
\
\
I give Perfect Blue a 9.1 out of 10. it is EXCELLENT!\

Feel free to leave a comment, Later!\

    Perfect Blue is about a pop-idol-turned-actress who suffers from \"I have no mouth and I must scream\" syndrome. In other words, the movie starts off slow and you have a good indicator of who the killer is, except you don't. What happens in the last half hour is a bunch of jumps from one scene to the next, where the persisting question is \"is this real?\". More than once, the VA's pull off a convincing job of \"solving\" the mystery only for it to jump once more. Honestly, Peter Jackson should be jealous of all the fake-outs. \
Aside the outdated reference, the art and sound\
          \
        direction are pretty solid.The late Satoshi Kon is behind the art of this movie and much like Millenium Actress, it really speaks for itself. Beautiful, expressive, and no frames wasted; this is one of THE finest anime films to date because of how well the animation conveys the emotions and experiences of each character. There is no excess of music to drum up false tension, and where it is used, you end up getting more into it. \
The writer, Sadayuki Murai, really hits his stride before the first ten minutes and keeps you until the very end. Like Millenium Actress, the story is about more than what is being told; it is an experience. From the moment the lead character steps into the world of acting to the end (I'm not giving anything away), you FEEL for her plight. All the extra characters aren't just background, either.\
If you ever find yourself sitting at home on a Saturday night with nothing to do, check out Perfect Blue. You won't regret it!",

    The story of Perfect Blue - a pop idol Mima Kirogoe who is starting her acting career after quiting the band CHAMI, but because of circumstances beyond her control is slowly brought under the grip of an initially un-named stalker, which has a significant impact on her life and this results in her trying to stay alive while still keeping with her role in this movie she is part of - has a plot which is suited for thrillers. While there may be criticism for it starting slowly and not immediately catching the attention of the viewer, it is nevertheless very engrossing, and this is\
          \
        especially exhibited through the character development of Mima Kirogoe, and Rumi Hidaka.\
Coming from Madhouse, it doesn't come as a surprise that the animation would be well handled in this work. This whole movie is an example of \"willing the suspension of disbelief\", especially as the story reaches the second half and is nearing the ending. The way it transitions from scene to scene, and also in how it maintains screen time between characters, add to the plot, give more elemental credence to the characters, and even push the story forward further. The animation is very critical in this movie, because it helps the viewer know how Mima is affected by the situation in the universe of perfect blue.\
Combining both the animation and the plot, is the sound: the eerie, almost engrossing sound is unsettling, develops according to the scene. It is well executed so far as music is concerned. So far as dialogues are concerned, even the minor characters such as the critics within the film itself, are natural - as if they know the faults of the movie Mima is starring in, and realize how those faults were \"engineered\" to help her rise as a movie star. When you watch the movie for the first time, those snarky comments tend to be ignored, but then you realize, they do give a certain amount of depth to the way the story has been orchestrated.\
This is a definitive classic, and one in which I, as a viewer, would recommend watching.\

    Perfect Blue is a perfect example of how I consider anime as a living piece of art (which probably goes the same for other kinds of media). What really captivates me with anime is that it explores all avenues of possible plot progressions, constructs the weirdest yet downright flexible combinations of genres and deviates from the normal spectrum of how a story is told in a visual animated context. I felt that in contrast to what usually appeals to me in anime which more often than not consists of a good plot progression with emphasized tones on climactic moments coupled with good character development, Perfect\
          \
        Blue utilized a brilliant combination of imagery, atmosphere transition and mind games that despite what I feel is a lack of fluidity and coherence in the plot itself, allowed me to fully appreciate what the anime is trying to convey. And yep, I was mind-blown. Like literally.\
That's why despite being a neophyte in the world of anime, I can't help but think of one word to describe Perfect Blue: Unorthodox. Well yeah anime veterans out there may probably say that it's not like it's totally out-of-the-world, but whatever.\
Perfect Blue starts off like the usual dark themed setting of most horror-psychological anime. It doesn't try to lighten up the atmosphere, as emphasized by creepy-looking people, sober tone of the scenes, and the uneasiness and tension building up as the plot went on. In fact, I felt that the overarching story of the movie seemed pretty standard, probably above the average plot construct, as gradually the details start to uncover themselves and coupling them with suspenseful plot devices. What I liked about the plot is that there is a consistency of emotion-building, in this case fear and suspense, as the viewer tries to understand the plot details coming from the most obvious perspective, which is the main character. What's even more appealing is how the fear-building is generated. At times, from a very linear form of storytelling of the viewer, the fear starts to grow steadily to reach the climactic suspense. At times, particularly in plot revelations, the fear is intensified and maintained throughout while forcing an abrupt cut in the tension, then introduces another source of fear and tension. What is commendable about it is that it forces the viewer to pace rapidly between moments of tension, confusion and fear as he tries to swallow up the entire thing. Then suddenly, the tables turn around, and what the main character is perceiving to be true is nothing but a possible creation of her own imagination (more on this later). The scene transition is commendable too, as it fluidly transform the conclusion of one scene into a stepping stone of the emotion-building of the next scene. So all in all, the plot was acceptably okay yet made outstanding by packing a whole lot of tension-building, and satisfactorily conveys that kind of emotion to the viewers.\
Another thing to point out, which I believe is the most appealing implication of the movie, aside from generating a good amount of fear, is the way it forces the viewer to reflect and think. No, it's not one of those anime who try too hard to \"think outside the box\", to raise and discuss philosophical and probably political and social issues yet failed to do such things satisfactorily (Parasyte, I am deeply disappointed.); what it does instead is to present you with a lot of mind games and trickery within the context of the movie, some might be the truth and some might be there to fool you. I felt that it was good to present these mind games to the main character and not only to the viewer, because it actually complements with the tension and fear generated by making the main character feel confused with what is happening around her and allow the viewer to sympathize with her. Then, as what I have mentioned, when the MC and the viewer believe that everything clears out, that's when the tables turn and the fear starts building again. When the plot details seem to come into a conclusion for a particular conflict, the anime suddenly leaves everything hanging and it ends with just... that. What's so good with it is that the details don't give you enough information to come up with a concrete conclusion, they still provide bits and bits of puzzle pieces apt to create speculations regarding the actual plot. Even when there seems to be a logical flow of the story, the anime still gives enough avenue for the viewer to speculate and think to what is more to the story. What is the real truth behind it? What is the ending supposed to convey to us? How is the title conveniently fitting for what the story has offered? Such mind games are literally mind-blowing.\
Last thing I'd like to discuss about the story presentation is the fact that it tries to incorporate abstractions in a concrete story line, with the addition that this concrete story line is set up in a very realistic context. These abstractions are in the form of mind games, illusions and hallucinations conjured mostly by the main character, fluidly artistic scene transitions and other metaphoric plot devices personally reminiscent of a mystery supernatural anime. Although abstractions are a major tool in the beauty of the film, and in fact a major form of plot device, I felt that they also compromised the coherence of the story line in general. As viewers might notice, these abstractions majorly aim to present the perspective of the main character, how it gradually becomes messed up and psychologically unable to distinguish truth and imagination. However I felt that it also became harder to decipher what is part of the realistic plot and what is a part of the abstraction. I don't think it inherently is a bad thing, but the lack of logical link of the chains of the real plot kinda hindered the plot to progress, as the anime focused majorly in presenting the abstractions and mixing them with actual plot details rather than developing the plot itself. The result is not the optimal proportion of the elements of the story - there was very, very good character development of the characters, with good toning, with less variation of the plot details. Is it even possible? Yes it is, mate, by actually relying on the same conflict over and over again in order to demonstrate how the main character falls into psychological disturbances. The characterization of the MC throughout the plot is vivid, but the actual plot revolves on the same conflict. Not to mention that the setting is in a realistic context, so these abstractions sometimes become \"uncomfortable\" when it becomes too \"real\". Fortunately the film is able to back this up by presenting details which tell you how these abstractions exist in the real world. Therefore, the abstractions are an avenue to serve two sides of the coin, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.\
The animation is amazing especially because of artistic scene transitions, and complements well with the atmosphere of fear and tension. The characters are drawn well in my opinion, and there's just this feel to this kind of animation that the plot's always about horror and suspense shit, I really don't know why but it suits well. The sound is satisfying in my opinion, and the soundtracks are pretty okay. It's not the reason why I liked the anime, anyway.\
Perfect Blue is a great way to spark interest in old anime with dark themes, and even in that respect, I can tell you that this anime blows minds more than most of the other respectable anime. I give my highest recommendations, because shit is about to get real.\
Get mind-blown in your own right, mate. Watch Perfect Blue.\

    Perfect Blue is one of THOSE kinds of movies. \"This movie will confuse you, I guarantee.\", they said. Hearing those words, I went into the movie with my Sherlock Holmes hat, prepared to deduce every scene, study the dialogue as it goes by, and call the plot twists before they happened. I was pretty proud of myself for the first half. \"I can do this!\", I said. \"I'm way smarter than those other viewers!\" \
Sadly, the smug smile I had on my face disappeared in the second half, putting my Sherlock-hat on the desk. I was beaten.\
Story (9/10):\
I'm a big fan of plots that can\
          \
        surprise me. A plot that can throw me for a loop, making me think I'm smart enough to have figured out the mystery, then smack me in the face for being a silly, stupid person, who thinks he was better than he thought he was. Perfect Blue does this with great effect.  \
Perfect Blue has a lot of tricks up it's sleeve for the viewer. Most notably are it's excellent uses of transitions. Whenever the viewer takes a backseat, and relaxes, it will transition in an interesting way, putting the viewer in a surprised state to grab their attention. This keeps the movie interesting, even if you don't completely understand what is happening. \
As I mentioned before, Perfect Blue leaves you in a constant state of confusion, especially in the second half. There's a positive side to this, but also a downside. The positive side, is that the movie is great to rewatch, arguably making it better, because all those subtle hints the movie gave away, are suddenly noticed. However, when you're watching it the first time, you can't help but feel bored sometimes, when the movie starts showing you things that, at the time, you either don't get, or you don't think is important.\
Art (7/10):\
What I like about Satoshi's art, is that you clearly know how the characters would look in real life. They don't all look like supermodels, you can clearly tell who's good looking, who's average looking, and who's downright ugly. The movie has realistic character designs.\
Saying that though, there was something that bugged me. Although the character styles might look realistic, they weren't exactly varied. The most notable is when Mima is performing with 'CHAM'. The faces of the three members really don't have any notable variation, except for the hairstyles. \
Sound (6/10):\
The soundtrack does it's job. It adds to the scenes, and makes things a bit creepier. Saying that though, there really wasn't anything that stood out. Well, except for one track. See, there is this track in the soundtrack that actually starts out as sound effects, like a fax machine. Slowly however, the music starts to play over it, and new SFX are introduced into the tune, and when everything is added at the end, it makes for a really excellent track, that you'll have in your head for at least one night. Not that you want it in your head, because it freaks you out, and it makes it hard to sleep at night, and is there something behind me right now?\
The Japanese voice actors do their job well, however, since I can't speak Japanese, it's kind of hard to criticize the performance. However, I could feel the emotion when some of the intense scenes come up.\
Characters (8/10):\
Before I go talking about the main character, I'll say something about the supporting cast. At the surface, the supporting cast isn't anything special. Throughout the entire movie, most of them are only there to have conversations with Mima, and give their input. What makes the supporting cast so great though, is that you don't really know who will break through their supporting cast roles, and become important. Some may seem extremely important to the story, but in truth, they aren't. Some may seem very unimportant, but are. \
Now onto Mima. I wouldn't really say that Mima is a strong character at the beginning. Her motives for becoming an actress aren't really explained, and some of her decisions are questionable at best. There is a positive point to this though. By making Mima a bit of a vague character, you don't really know what she's capable of, so if she does make an important decision, you don't know what she will do.\
What makes Mima interesting though, is her psychological breakdown during the movie. A lot of the weird things that happen in the movie actually reveal part of Mima's psyche, which allows for a lot of fun analyzing. \
Overall (8/10):\
Perfect Blue is a really good movie. It has a good length, so things don't really feel dragged out, and when the confusing stuff does happen, the viewer will know that the payoff isn't too far away. If you are a bit patient with it, and can stand confusion for the sake of a strong payoff, then this movie is definitely for you. However, if you're someone who prefers a lot of action, and can't stomach disturbing scenes (this movie is definitely 18+), then you might want to pass this one up. Otherwise, I will recommend this movie.\

    [THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]\
Dreams are elusive, and yet we are willing to take risks and sacrifice safety in order to attain it. But not all dreams are possible; some of us continue to traverse only to realize that we are chasing an illusion. The inevitable transformation and the distortion of reality brought by the journey through stardom unfold in this film.\
Mima Kirigoe is an ex-pop star turned actress. In hopes of a better career Mima decided to leave her three-member idol group ‘CHAM!’ and shortly after she received her first project as actress in a TV series ‘Double Bind’. Fame comes with consequences and sometimes\
          \
        life-threatening ones; a website about her was created called ‘Mima’s Room’ in which her day-to-day solitary activities were posted. This posited anxiety on her part and she became vigilant. The story takes turn when she accepted a rape scene to prove her acting skills. Our avidity is sometimes paired with ignorance which makes us decide rashly. Mima breakdowns after realizing her fishes are dead.\
“Of course I didn’t want to do it! But I couldn’t trouble all the people who brought me this far!”\
The expectations of our loved ones, the desire not to let them down fuels us to push ourselves further and in the process we forget what we truly want. We are stuck pleasing them because the pain of disappointing our loved ones is too unbearable. Mima starts having hallucinations in which her Idol Mima self talks to her as if to mock her of her choice to leave her pop idol career.\
“Well… how do you think you know that person you were a second ago is the same person you are now? A continuous stream of memories. Given only that, we all create illusions within ourselves saying that we each have only one fixed persona.”\
Slowly, Mima drifts away from reality and starts to question everything. When we cannot prove our own existence, how can we say which is real and not? Rumi turns out to be the false diarist of Mima’s Room. Rumi is the manager and has been, from the start, against Mima pursuing an acting career. For her, Mima is better off as an idol. Whether or not this stems from her genuine concern for Mima or her own experience as an ex-idol, whats patent is that Rumi tried to deceive Mima for her to give up her dream of being an actress. Me-mania is the same as Rumi, acting as if he knows what’s better. Although this comes from a place of genuine concern or maybe obsession, what we know is that he’s chasing a dream—to be with Mima. \
Sometimes we make decisions for other people convincing ourselves that this is for the best. We convince ourselves that we know better because we have been there, but how sure are we to know that other people will end up on the same place as us? Are we doing this for them or are we doing this for us? There are things we can never pass onto other people. \
“You should stop dreaming soon.”\
This is my first film of Satoshi Kon. I liked the plot. I liked the confusion it brought me that made me question the events of the story. I was anxious because I couldn't trust what's happening. I watched it thrice.t\

    I can't really say I enjoyed watching Perfect Blue.  This anime is really not suitable for children.  The story was strong with good characters.  About 20 minutes into the movie I started to get uncomfortable and this feeling stuck with me for the rest of the movie.  What I did like about the anime is when reality and fantasy start to unravel for the main characters it takes the audience along for the ride.\

    The only other negative review on here is written by someone who clearly hates horror or dark things in the vein of this movie, so I figure in counter to the good reviews AND that review, I will write this.\
Is this movie for you?\
Do you see a lot of horror/psychological drama? This is a very obvious plotted movie, easy to guess everything. Worse yet the first half is more drama than horror, played with an obvious mental breakdown. It may have been unique in its day (though I don't believe so), but more likely a lot of Moe and Shounen or Magical Girl fans have\
          \
        just never seen anything like this, and most people didn't expect this from anime at the time.\
Why I dislike it? (Spoilers)\
The plot is pretty obvious. That's say that I DROPPED the movie halfway through, about 2 anime episodes worth of movie, and then read ahead in a plot description to find I had correctly guessed everything that would happen. I paged ahead in the movie to see that it does get a bit more graphic, but the first half is painful to sit through. It's like a lifetime movie production, or some cheap paperback you pick up at a yard sale. Every element has been done 1000 times since, they've been done in the same movie, I'm pretty sure they were done before hand also based on movies I've seen from the 80s.\
The art style is ok, however there are a few errors here or there. It's worth noting all the bad people are ugly, all the good people are pretty. I liked the costume designs. I did not enjoy the sound track though.\
The characters are hardest to sympathize with. I appreciated that her manager, the male one, was doing his best for her. However the main character herself is a dolt. At literally the exact same year she was learning to use her computer, me and a class of 20 other 2nd graders were learning to do the exact same. But it's not just that. She takes all the worst advice from everyone, has almost no ability to see what's going on \"Haha, this person really knows me!\", even when things are literally blowing up she doesn't have the presence of mind to get help. So yes, she's stupid. It doesn't mean I want her to get murdered, but it doesn't make her an interesting character to watch.\
Interesting characters have always been the creative, bright ones who find ways through their situations in interesting ways. Sherlock Holmes to L, Or at least have tenacity. She's whiny, cowardly, makes bad decisions, doesn't seem to manage relationships well. I realize it must be hard to write a horror story (if this is indeed even intended to be one) where the character is not a ditz, but this takes it possibly too far. \

    *Warning* Since this movie is graphic, I'm going to assume those reading it will be of the right maturity level to watch it. Therefore, this review contains copious profanity.\
\
OVERALL (10), I mean, fuck... Where do I start with this. This is a character driven story, and the characters are flawless in the sense that they drive the story perfectly. The characters themselves are kind of underfed. Not to the point where they become incomprehensible but just enough to notice that you don't really know them very well. But this god damn story is so well executed that it doesn't even matter. This is absolutely a\
          \
        movie for someone who enjoys anything about the human psyche, any mindfuckery, or anyone that can stand gruesome animated scenes for the sake of a story well told. In terms of animation, there is not much to say. For 1997, this is fucking fluid. Yeah, its not perfect and pales in comparison to more modern animation but it has held up incredibly well to the test of time. The soundtrack varies only in genre and certainly not in quality. To nutshell I'll quote a friend of mine who saw it. \"Fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff-\" *leaves room*\
STORY AND ENJOYMENT (10) are at the heart of this review. Since I'm giving this review my absolute full recommendation, and I definitely hate reviews that talk about what happens in what I'm about to watch, I'm only going to say that this story is definitely something you want to sit down and pay attention to because there are a lot of little details that you can miss along the way. This goes the same for CHARACTERS (7) as they are central to the plot and describing them, analyzing them, or critiquing them would get in the way of an initial viewing of the movie. Good stories are good the first time. Amazing stories are better the second time. Perfect Blue is certainly the latter. \
ANIMATION (6) like I said is stunning for when it was made. Even if this is a movie with a significant budget, the animation only really falters in the very sparse talking head scene or when the camera zooms out on a crowd, which is as much as you can really expect from something that was made prior to the digital era we're in now. The art style and color scheme are really similar to that of Bebop but polished quite a bit in comparison (which is saying something considering Bebop's high quality). All the parts that need to be animated well are and none of the animation takes away from the all important story.\
SOUND (8) is something that really adds a certain je ne se quoi when the movie really start to fuck with your head. Some of these tracks wouldn't be out of place in an audiobook reading of Alice in Wonderland. Others are more catchy, which serve to take you out the intensity of some of the scenes but are actually still used in some of the more intense scenes which too lends a certain horrible charm to them. In terms of the voice acting, I'd have to say top notch for the Japanese dub. I have not yet seen the English dub but the show is steeped sort of heavily in Japanese culture that I'd imagine some of the dialogue wouldn't make the translation unscathed.\
SUMMARY\
God damn watch this movie. If you're underage put it on your to do list for when you turn 18. If you cant stand X-rated graphic animation, get over it and WATCH THIS MOVIE. The best comparison to something more mainstream I can make is to Inception.\
Except actually good.\

    This is an amazing psychological thriller, and also VERY characteristic of Satoshi Kon.  If you generally enjoy his work, it's likely that you'll enjoy this movie.  I don't recommend asking people about it or reading about it before you watch it, because it's much better if you let it play out and surprise you.  \
The art leans toward the realistic side, as opposed to some of the spider-legged, large-eyed characters in other anime.  The imagery is absolutely perfect.  It really speaks to the story and to the viewer.  \
This piece purposely gives you a hard time figuring out who's\
          \
        who and what's what.  It raises a lot of questions in the realm of the individual perception of reality, and it also explores a lot of the possible answers.  This anime is NOT for people who enjoy clear stories and closure.  You have to open your mind and follow Mima on her psychological journey.\

    I can't find the exact word to describe how twisted this movie is. My head was blown by everything, and I could no longer tell between reality and illusions. Every scene took you to the other, and things got so confusing to the point that I started wondering if the end will be her waking up and finding out this was all a dream.\
Honestly speaking, this movie is so confusing and damn scary at night alright (watch this at 2PM and you'll see what I mean), you can't tell if everything happening is in the main character's head because of paranoia and the drastic changes\
          \
        in her life, or if this was actually real. \
There are scenes that will make you go 'wtf?' or you'd just sit there and wondering what the hell you just watched, but I have my promise, this movie is one of a kind. You think you know how it ends, but then the end will have you frozen or drop your jaw. \
PS: watch it at night, it'll always be better in a cozy bed with a teddy bear in your arms. \

    Perfect blue. Alert contains small spoilers\
Perfect Blue is a principle, a psychological thriller. The whole script of the film follows as the main rules of the genre, once by traditional tradition in spectator and character - throughout the narrative we must experience what a protagonist feels like situations of her position. That's why the film world is also part of our world. This is a first idea for a work directed by Satoshi Kon.\
For what you want to buy, Perfect Blue may just be another thriller. To those who try to charge a verisimilitude worthy of a Black Swan (a very similar film directed by\
          \
        Darren Aronofsky in 2010), an incorrect construction. This is because there are two ideas inserted in the script that do not fit the direct approach. The first is a metalanguage (inside the film there is a TV series about crimes being recorded). The second is that narrative and dramatic precision does not interest Satoshi Kon.\
For those who think of the film as a common story, it probably will not please, mainly because of the technical problems of its production (art and animation), which can sometimes cause some to lose their concentration. Another problem for these people may be the obvious conclusion of the facts in the movie presented (be predictable). And maybe an anger grows with the final scene of the film, called by members of the \"Fat and Furious\" group (only the strong will understand). So I would not recommend the movie to these people.\
But for those who dig deeper and / or are minimally connoisseurs of cinema, the feature will be a great attraction, as it was for me, but not for the other members of the group. For spectators like this, I not only recommend the film, but I venture to say that it was a little masterpiece for the history of cinema.\

    Well...just finished watching Perfect Blue..yep..Pretty damn confusing and scary. Still loved it though, the story was great had amazing twists that made this movie very unpredictable for the most part. Definitely not recommended for children or queasy people when it comes to blood, rape, nudity and violence. The art wasn't the best, but considering it was made in the 90's and that it wasn't the greatest time for madhouse I would say it was okay-ish. Characters were developed well as far as I can remember. I personally loved everything about this movie ^.^ Oh and sorry for lake of detail in my review...(First review) hahaha.....\

    Perfect Blue is one of those types of movies where if you don't watch it from start to finish and pay very close attention, it's going to screw with your head. At the end of the movie I was like O_O...\"wait what!?\" However, it does leave you feeling bad for the main character which is always the sign of a great story, which this one does have. It leans more towards adult viewers rather then teenagers mainly due to nudity, blood and 2 rape-ish scenes. Like it says on the DVD box art, if Alfred Hitchcock teamed up with Walt Disney, this would be their\
          \
        creation. It's hard to explain the movie so just check it out if you're in the mood for a story driven anime rather then an action packed one. Even though the climax is pretty exciting in my own opinion. Oh and one more thing, I gave the only 10 to the sound mainly because both the Dubbed version and the original Japanese version are done perfectly. So watch whichever version suits you I suppose.\

Sadly, all good things must come to an end, and CHAM! must see one of its members, Mima Kirigoe, leave the group to pursue her acting career. While Mima's choice is met with a mixed response, she hopes her fans will continue to support her. However, Mima's life begins to change drastically after her departure from the group. Wanting to shed her pop-idol image, she takes on a role in a crime drama series, and her career as an actress gradually becomes more demanding and taxing for both Mima and her manager, Rumi Hidaka. To add to Mima's growing unease, an obsessed fan who is incapable of accepting that Mima has quit being an innocent idol, begins stalking her; a new anonymous website begins to impersonate her life with intricate detail; and CHAM! also appears to be doing better without her. One by one, each disturbing development drives Mima to become increasingly unhinged and unable to distinguish reality from fantasy. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
