    \"Samurai Champloo\" may not have the same ring to it as \"Cowboy Bebop,\" yet it is a title that has a similar function: to illustrate a combination of multicultural pulp fiction sensibility.  Where Cowboy Bebop was a past + future fusion of jazz, rock, and blues, spaghetti western, kung fu, and noir cinema genres, and a setting equating outer space to the great frontier, Samurai Champloo is a more wildly anachronistic mélange of Edo-period history and contemporary hip-hop and bohemian culture.  \"Champloo\" itself comes from the word \"chanpurū,\" Okinawan for \"something mixed,\" and a source of Okinawa's pride in multicultural acceptance.  Cowboy\
          \
        Bebop was a trend-setting marriage of anime traditions and Tarantino-inspired cultural hodgepodge — it could be said that Pulp Fiction influenced Cowboy Bebop as much as Cowboy Bebop influenced Kill Bill — and Samurai Champloo continues in this meta style, taking it even further.\
Of course, Cowboy Bebop was not Shinichiro Watanabe's first foray into resonant crossover in anime: Macross Plus was a monolithic amalgamation of Top Gun's hot-headed romantic drama and sci-fi tropes including a pop-idol hologram version of 2001: A Space Odyssey's HAL, in turn influencing the famous cyberpunk writer William Gibson to write Idoru, a novel about a Japanese virtual idol and her marriage to a real-life rock star.  Of course, all of this was before the invention of the Vocaloid, though I suppose the future imagined by Watanabe and Gibson was, in a way, not so far off.\
Anyhow, now that I've finished my little history lesson — which I feel is relevant, as having such a perspective may deepen your enjoyment of Samurai Champloo as much as it did for me — let's continue on to the review.  In light of all the prescient futurism found in Watanabe's other works, it's rather interesting that he decided to shift his focus to the past and present.  Of course, the world's future is always in its past... and what we have here is, in a nutshell, Edo-period Japan: the remix.  Baseball, tagging/graffiti, Van Gogh, zombies, and Catholicism are tossed into the \"chanpurū\" with a whole lot of revised Japanese pseudo-history.  As such the medley of influences and tangential tale-spinning occasionally smacks of filler, but one would do well to understand that this show is simply all /about/ the filler — and this is all for the better, because Samurai Champloo is at its freshest and most hilarious when it's veering off the rails.  It even has the single most entertaining recap episode I've ever seen.  Even with all this episodic improv, Fuu's journey in search of a \"samurai who smells like sunflowers\" provides a compelling core to the story, much like a steady hip-hop beat giving structure to the mix of samples and freestyle verses.  Her ronin traveling companions Mugen and Jin mingle like oil and water, and there we have the perfect cast for hilarity and drama.\
Samurai Champloo is one good-looking show, with its thick linework giving an impression of manga blended with graffiti style.  One episode even takes a quick trip into the psychedelic, with a sudden burst of colorful hallucination, Mind Game style — courtesy of episode key animator Masaaki Yuasa, of course.  A wide variety of such notable animators were brought on board and thus the style occasionally varies slightly from episode to episode or even scene to scene, but it's always pleasing and completely in tune with the show's theme.  Rural Japan has never looked so urban; almost any given scene in Samurai Champloo would be right at home spray-painted on the side of a city building or underpass.\
The music, likewise, blends hip-hop, rhythm & blues, and traditional Japanese shamisen.  Music often plays second fiddle to the look and quality of the animation when it comes to my enjoyment of anime, but in some cases it becomes just as important.  This is one such anime, where the music contributes so greatly to the feel of it that it defines it and sets it apart from other anime — much like the soundtrack by Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts did for Cowboy Bebop.  It's also worth mentioning that rap and beatboxing sometimes enter the dialogue, and it's always amusing.  Admittedly, most younger people these days are far more familiar with hip-hop than they are with the jazz, blues, and big band genres; nonetheless, in the realm of anime this feels a bit groundbreaking, especially with the theme songs featuring Japanese rap lyrics.  The world is getting bigger and smaller every day.\
Samurai Champloo is a show for everyone.  Plenty of great sword-slashing action, clever comedy, and a good share of moments that will tug at your heartstrings — often all at once.  If you enjoy anime, this is one you can't miss.\

    I caught Samurai Champloo as it aired back in 2004, and though I liked it enough, it didn’t impact me as much as I hoped it would. Though maybe that’s not entirely true, as the soundtrack did indirectly change my life, thanks to the composer Nujabes introducing me to instrumental hip hop and providing a soundtrack to my life for the next few years.\
I recently re-watched the show and felt compelled to write a retrospective/review of the series. While watching Jin, Mugen and Fuu traipse around 19th century Japan getting into ridiculous adventures, I realised Shinichirô Watanabe’s follow up to Cowboy Bebop is one of\
          \
        the most subversive animes ever made. Taking a staple genre, dressing it up in anachronism, but continually tackling subjects often avoided by the medium.\
It takes 25 episodes until a character literally says “I was born in the wrong era.” Champloo is basically saying Japan’s lofty samurai era was actually a shit place to live for common people like us actually thank you very much.\
It’s a divisive show that tested the patience of many viewers, drove others away entirely after a few episodes, and frustrated people who were too used to watching a plot move characters forward for 26 episodes. Champloo doesn’t even have characters who move the plot forward. The hook of how the three disparate characters end up travelling together through Edo period Japan is just that, it’s a hook to draw you in.\
Samurai Champloo is about, and also not about, three characters hunting a samurai who smells of sunflowers. There’s an episode late into the series which features two street gangs having a graffiti battle across town, and though somewhat amusing also served no benefit towards the journey of the three characters. So if you hop into any forum thread you’ll see a multitude of complaints about it. However, the point of the episode is the same as the theme running throughout the entire show: people from a bygone era rebelling against authority and social norms in a way 21st century people do: through counter-culture.\
I’ve gained a new appreciation for this show. It’s been so so long since I saw it, but rewatching it I realise how the story is about how incompatible Tokugawa era Japan is with our way of life; all the things we take for granted were rare luxuries back then. This is an obvious fact for anyone with a remote understanding of Japanese history, but still, the show rams it home with stark contrasts. Each episode highlights a 21st century aspect of our lives, a form of freedom (creative, sexual, geographical, etc) that characters in the 19th century yearned for despite the odds.\
It’s set in an era ruled by rigid order, social rules and hierarchies. Stifling to the point of causing grief among the downtrodden populace. Yet a populace we should not treat as foreign aliens. The show asks us to empathise with them; they were just like us. Some of them had our modern spirit and ultimately struggled to exist in such a society as a result. Our heroes are a ronin, vagabond, and an orphan. Fighting against their era’s rules with a modern spirit.\
One of the things I love about this show is how the three characters hate each other for the majority of the 26 episodes, but their hatred gives away inch by inch. They initially try to break apart, to run away from each other, but situations conspire to brig them back together, until a turning point where they actively make a choice to stick together, grudgingly recognising that they are of the same fiery rebellious soul. This is infinitely more satisfying than characters who automatically stick together from the outset. Another theme of Champloo is that travelling a journey with strangers can bring you together like family.\
Champloo is more known for its scenes that are juxtaposed with modern quirks such as people beatboxing to humorous and surreal effect, and scene transitions that look like a DJ playing with their deck.\
Episode topics try to cover every area that is barely explored by other samurai-era anime that are more concerned with traditional ‘fight evil’ plots (or even movies for that matter) from the prevalence of the yakuza co-existing with samurai, the tragedy of women forced into prostitution to pay off their husbands’ debts, human trafficking in the art world, existence of homosexuality, persecution of Christians and Ainu, and graffiti gangs with too much time on their hands. There’s even a hilarious baseball game with members of an American expedition that predates Commodore Perry’s by a few years.\
Champloo features one of the best soundtracks ever, brought to you by Nujabes, whose life was tragically cut short in 2010. Instrumental hip hop might bring to your mind a certain perception of what to expect, but the soundtrack is a mixture of traditional beats with Japanese influence, floating ephemeral sounds constantly conjure a feeling of melancholy, or ‘mono no aware’, the fleeting transience of things.\
The appeal of the show is ‘style over substance’, however that is a great discredit to what Champloo accomplishes. All the modern quirks in historical context are not just there to make the show stand out visually. The show is about entertaining this idea, this hope, that even back in Edo era Japan there were open-minded people fighting for creativity, individuality and basic human rights. Sure, most of them didn’t last long, but they didn’t die without a fight. Banzai!\

             Samurai Champloo is the latest work from Writer/Director Shinichiro Watanabe, who is most recognized for his work on Cowboy Bebop. One of the very few things Champloo and Bebop have in common is their great scores. Champloo mixes two subjects which would never be put in one sentence together, western hip-hop and eastern samurai swordplay. Yet the mixture comes out with a brilliant result. The fights scenes are hyped up with the speed and flow from the music and come out magnificent. But Champloo isn't all about fighting. Many things happen along the road for the\
          \
        three main characters: Mugen, a rough mouth vagrant with a fighting style similar to capoeira with a sword. Jin, a quite and intelligent ronin who fights with deadly lightning speeds. And Fuu, the ditsy waitress that brings these two together in search of a samurai who smells of sunflowers. Between these three we see many moments of humorous antics, whether it's Mugen poking insults at her flat chest or Mugen and Jin’s constant attempts on each others life. Samurai Champloo is fueled by Action, Comedy, and Drama. Together with an original story Samurai Champloo has a unique spin on the old samurai era making it a great find for any fan of anime.\
Story\
         The story of Champloo is an original work from Shinichiro Watanabe. The story centers on Fuu’s search for a samurai who smells of sunflowers. As the wanders continue on their travel they encounter many problems, mostly dealing with how to make money for their various expenses some times causing trouble for the three. In the travels many humorous things occur like Mugen entering a beetle type cock fight, Jin and Mugen’s adventure in to the red-light district, or the three entering an eating contest. As the three get closer to the samurai who smells of sunflowers, things begin to unravel leading the three to the most trouble they have ever seen.\
Animation\
        Champloo has crisp clean stylistic animation. Characters are draw clean and clear with many details. The landscapes of Champloo are filled with beautiful shots of Japan’s country side. There are even a few scenes were the animation becomes only black and white and seem as they where draw straight from sketches to add to the scene. There is also one part were the colors and animation becomes so lively that it gives the impression of a whacked out hallucination. \
Sound\
        The score of Champloo is what sets its self apart from any other anime in its genre. The background music is filled with urban hip-hop to give it a loose free flowing fill to it. A big portion of Champloo is focused on its original sound and it shows. For action scenes we get a fast flowing sound that gives the sword fights a more stylistic feel to them. For the more dramatic scenes we get deeper sounding background music. There are even moments during some flash back scenes were the music that we get to hear a rich Japanese sound to give a deeper feeling to it.\
Characters\
        Samurai Champloo focuses around 3 core characters. Mugen is a straight loud mouth anti-hero. Mugen is the wild one of the group, always flying by the seat of his pants. Mugen also seems to have a problem with authority. Mugen is the first to draw and the last to leave a fight. Jin is a noble ronin in the search of a purpose. Jin although quite and wise, he too has some distaste with authority like Mugen, although with different reason mainly because he sees the one’s in charge as waste. Fuu is a young girl in the search of a samurai who smells of sunflowers, she keeps these reasons to herself for some reason. Fuu is clumsy and some times naive. Fuu is constantly being kidnapped even though she has two strong bodyguards. And for some reason she keeps a flying squirrel with her to help out sometimes. \
Enjoyment\
         Any one who is a fan of samurai action will surely like Champloo. Filled with enough action to keep those hard core action fans at bay, Champloo sprinkles some comedy and drama on top. If you are someone who doesn't like the hip-hop aspect of Champloo, then at least give it a try, you may be surprised. \

    Historical anime don't usually interest me, but when it's as tongue-in-cheek and as full of anachronisms as this, I'm not sure it really counts as a historical anime anymore.\
STORY - Like its predecessor Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo is a very episodic series, and it's perfectly safe to miss a few episodes here or there. Even the overarching story remains incredibly vague for almost the entirety of the series and the audience is sometimes left to wonder if there really is a point to all of that searching when they knew virtually nothing to begin with. There's something about the lack of details that makes this\
          \
        story appealing though -- it never seems that important, so you just continue along, but deep in the back of your head, you remain curious about it. So it's the perfect situation; there's immediate gratification within each mostly-standalone episode, but there's also the thread that ties all of those little adventures together, and in the end, there is an ending.\
CHARACTER - As with many other slice-of-life or episodic series, much of the entertainment relies on the characters, and herein is a very strong point for the series. All three of our protagonists are rich, interesting characters with backstories that don't seem to clash with their general personalities. As strangers that all met coincidentally in the first episode, their histories are gradually revealed throughout the course of the series in a perfectly paced, even casual way. Though this involves a bunch of chance encounters with figures from their respective pasts, none of them ever really seem to intrude upon the story for the sole purpose of explaining things, which is great. And their stories all actually do contribute to their personalities as a whole, making them all fully-rounded characters with an enjoyable amount of depth to them. \
The characters also really contribute to the sometimes satirical nature of the series. Jin could be, at first glance, your stereotypical samurai. Or maybe he really just is, but the fact that they poke fun at him for it makes his whole stance all the more questionable. Mugen is just ridiculous; after all, his fighting technique is rooted in break dancing. And Fuu... well, I suppose Fuu is the least notable of them all, though I sort of feel like I can conclude her a mockery of typical women in samurai anime if I'd seen more samurai anime. Even given the normalcy of her character, she has enough emotion and perseverance to keep her from being called flat.\
ARTSTYLE & ARTWORK - Given the time period of the series and all the anachronistic elements, Champloo's art style is very fun and unique. The opening and ending sequences are a great example already. The blending of modern ideas with such a traditional setting is brilliant and very interesting to see. One of the best examples within the series would probably be the graffiti episodes, where yes, there's totally a town in feudal Japan with a street graffiti problem and two rival gangs that won't stop tagging everything. The animation itself is of good quality throughout and it's definitely an aesthetically pleasing series.\
MUSIC - The music in Champloo suits it perfectly with its clash of ancient and modern, traditional Japanese folk music and present-day hip hop. The opening and ending themes are also wonderfully appropriate to many aspects of the series.\
VOICE ACTING - I've seen both the sub and dub, and I must say, both are quite excellent. While I wouldn't necessarily venture to say that the dub is better than the sub (as was certainly the case with Bebop), it definitely stands on at least the same level. Dub-wise, it might have been the easy choice to cast Steve Blum as Mugen, considering Spike Spiegel and Mugen not only had similar personalities, but also looked similar, but damn, the man sure does the job well. (Admission of bias: I love Steve Blum's voice.) Jin's and Fuu's English voices were also quite awesome and actually sounded rather similar to their Japanese counterparts. The characters introduced in each episode also maintained above average voices for the most part, with appropriately sinister voices for the sinister and bumbling voices for the bumbling. All expressed emotion well and were generally convincing all around.\
OVERALL - Samurai Champloo was a very fun series. Almost all the episodes were excellent in themselves with a great story, as well as great technical aspects. But the overarching story, when it finally did come together in the end, was actually really nice too. And simple as the ending was, I liked it, was satisfied, and thought it was worth it.",

    For anyone who has watched Cowboy Bebop, they know that director Shinichiro Watanabe loves blending completely disparate elements together, be it science fiction, physical comedy, spaghetti Western, bebop jazz, or space epic, all into the same story.\
As diverse as \"Cowboy Bebop\" was, it has nothing on the sheer schizophrenia of \"Samurai Champloo\", Watanabe's most recent effort. On the surface, it's a mixture of comedy and samurai epic about Japan in the mid 1600s. However, that doesn't do the series any more justice than calling \"Cowboy Bebop\" a space western.\
One episode is a Shaolin Soccer-esque comedy about a baseball game. Another is a zombie horror story\
          \
        which doubles as an allegory for World War 2. The series presents historically accurate facts about the spread of Christianity in Japan side-by-side with rocket launchers, talks about Edo-style painting and Vincent Van Gogh in the same episode as punks with switchblades and green mohawks.\
There are young street gangs painting graffiti, near-invincible blind warriors modeled upon Zaotichi, honorable samurai warriors, arrogant fashion designers, mid 17th century Japanese beat boxing rappers, and eating competitions.\
Hip-hop and rap music is as prominent as traditional Japanese and Aina-style music.\
Most directors attempting such a crazy mix would be met with failure and ridicule. However, Shinichiro Watanabe manages to succeed, and he does so thanks to several different elements;\
1. Comedy- Samurai Champloo might well be the funniest anime series I've ever seen. Whether it be over-the-top action scenes, great situational comedy, or the absurdity of so many different elements in the same time period and place, there are certain moments in the series that will have one gasping for air.\
2. A hard, brutal, uncompromising story- The above works especially well because of how gritty, bloody, and tragic the majority of the story is. Most of the characters die. There is rarely a happy ending. Even in the instances when the good guys \"win\", it's not clear whether they're better off than they were originally.\
3. Misdirection- In every series or movie, a director can leave lots of minor hints and clues about what's going to happen. Most of the time they are fulfilled. In this series, though, Watanabe does the exact opposite of what one is expecting.\
A small example of this is when an old man is giving one of the samurai protagonists, Jin, a lecture about going with the current to catch a fish. The man is clearly wise, the music becomes serious, and like lightning, his hands dart through the pristine, blue river. His hands rise above his head, clenched hard, golden in the light of the sun.\
Suddenly, the record scratches, the man opens his hand, and it turns out there's no fish.\
\"Well, sometimes they get away, anyhow!\" the man exclaims with a laugh.\
There are dozens of such examples throughout the series. The ending is probably the best case of misdirection, being the complete opposite of what I expected.\
4. Memorable characters- While the former pirate and violent vagrant Mugen is probably the star of the show, and the source of most of the laughs, he does not completely outshine straightman, and traditional, honorable samurai Jin, who is every bit as interesting of a character, and provides plenty laughs of his own. Even Fuu, the girl guiding them, isn't the typical annoying Japanese anime heroine, and is a great set-up and comedic foil for the two mismatched warriors.\
This series is an absolute classic, my favorite anime ever.\

    The premise is simple, three complete strangers drawn together by fate to embark on a long, very parlous journey across unfamiliar territory. However, it's not the plot which makes Samurai Champloo note worthy, but rather the characters themselves. There is a very strong relate-ability present in the main characters Jin, Mugen and Fuu; no matter who the viewer happens to be it's a more than safe bet they will instantly find common ground with at least one if not all three. This element within it's self is the very one which drives the series forward, it offers added interest and added suspense as each of\
          \
        our three travailing companions find themselves in some rather tense situations quite regularly. The true paradox in Samurai Champloo is that it's actually the main characters' normality which makes them so extraordinary.\
Jin is a quiet, very strong willed, mysterious man of few words and it shows through greatly in his swordsmanship. Gin fights the same way he lives, with decisiveness, with great resolve, and with honor. Jin is a man of tradition, and a man of respect. It comes as no surprise he isn't one to allow someone under his skin during the heat of battle, he remains un-rattled and content with his abilities even in times of great adversities.      \
Mugen can easily be considered Jin's polar opposite; unlike Jin, Mugen has no concept of reserve, always speaks his mind despite the outcome, he is an extremely reckless individual who is easily the most cut throat free spirit in existence. Mugen inadvertently thrives off of defying the laws and 'order' around him, but in reality he's simply seeking an opponent who he feels would prove as a worthy match for his skill and ability. There are some who claim they'd laugh in the face of death, Mugen would beat each and every one of you to it.\
Fuu is unlike either of the two samurai who accompany her. Although she's a bit of a klutz and slightly clueless at times, Fuu proves to be a lot more cunning and determined than first impressions are willing to let on. Fuu is the type of girl who once her mind is made up, nothing except death could stop her from chasing and attempting to reach her goals and aspirations, but like everyone, some times she just needs a bit of motivation.  \
Samurai Champloo is able to excel where most other series fail, it's ability to balance both comedic elements with serious, very deep subject matter is a direct result of the characters themselves. Nothing seems forced, every line of dialog is believable, everything seems to fit with the personality, actions and dominate traits Jin, Mugen and Fuu possess; although most would think this should be expected, it's not an easy feat to accomplish. The multi dimensional perspective of Jin, Mugen, and Fuu's outward actions, as well as inner feelings more than make up for the lack of complexity in the story's plot. After all, who here hasn't seen an anime about samurai? \
Most importantly this series left me fulfilled, it didn't leave any questions unanswered, and to me the ending, although somewhat anti climatic was in my opinion a more than suited one to close the final pages on what is one of my favorite animes of all time. You'll laugh, maybe even cry and through it all you'll enjoy every minute of it, and chances are you'll want to experience it all over again in the not to distant future.\

    Samurai Champloo is frequently compared to Cowboy Bebop, but there's one thing that really sets it apart: the action. There wasn't anything bad about Bebop's action, but Champloo's action is among the best of any anime out there, especially among TV series. Though the main characters both use swords, they fight with wildly different styles (Mugen's use of shoes is particularly brilliant), and the fights against enemies with various weapons throughout the series all manage to make themselves interesting and different. Even if the rest of the series were terrible, it would be worth watching simply for the action.\
But the rest of the series manages\
          \
        to be entertaining as well. The main story's not anything special, but the stories told in individual episodes range from hilarious to heartbreaking. Each story is genuinely unpredictable due to the bloody nature of the series, and you can never tell whether the encounter's going to end well or not. That's not to say that the show revels in violence for the sake of violence, as conflicts are frequently solved peacefully as well.\
The main characters themselves are all solid, but where they truly shine is in their interactions with other characters. The series is never content to just follow one character's story. All three of the characters will often split up, meet separate characters, and go through development of their own while the tertiary characters develop as well. Sometimes the stories will all be related, while other times they share only thematic links, but this structure keeps the show interesting and fast-paced at all times.\
The style of the show likewise contributes to making everything more interesting. The artstyle is gorgeous, and the animation is always pretty. More important is the way hip-hop themes are integrated into the show. I'm not a fan of hip-hop in general, but the style here is absolutely perfect, contributing greatly to the humor of the show. It never dominates an episode completely, but it provides little touches that make otherwise ordinary characters and scenes special. A rumor might be told as a rap, and the episode might otherwise be completely devoid of hip-hop references. The music does have some hip-hop influences, but they never dominate the score, so don't worry that you'll dislike the music if you don't like hip-hop.\
The humor of the show in general is likewise top-notch. The comedy episodes are some of the best in the show, partly because they tackle serious themes (such as Japan being invaded) in very comical ways. These episodes are also just as violent as the rest of the show, and include the same hip-hop styling to make things stay fun. Mugen is frequently the source of most of the laughs, but Fuu and Jin also frequently amuse, as does the side cast. Even the serious episodes often have jokes at very inappropriate times, and because of the style of the show, those jokes work.\
I watched Samurai Champloo for the action, but every other aspect of the show completely surpassed my expectations. While I wouldn't call it perfect, as one or two of the episodes aren't very good and only a few are truly exceptional, I will say that I was never bored, and I usually had a smile on my face. Samurai Champloo is just plain fun.\

Maybe the story is not the best out there or is not the kind of art style that i usually like but it is good despite if i like it or not and the story even if it's not what i was expecting it was kind of good because it was episodic for the most part (which i don't like that much but if it's well made i will like it) and it's good, entertaining and enjoyable for the laughs and fight scenes.\
[b][u]Story[/u][/b]\
We follow the story of a girl named Fuu who wants to find a samurai that smells like sunflowers, she brings Mugen\
          \
        and Jin together after she met Mugen who triggered someone to burn the teahouse she worked as a waitress and Jin entering by coincidence and fighting with Mugen and therefore ''saving'' them from decapitation, they will find people that has relation with the plot but for the most parts are side stories, dealing with mature situations and that was good and entertaining although there is a thing forgotten later, maybe that only bothered me (a little) and it was that old ''mercenary'' samurai that was fighting against Jin who was really powerful and because of his power i wanted to see him again, just like he said himself that he had a feeling they will meet again and i was expecting him to appear in every ep. why? because he said so, but he doesn't appear again and ep. 22 and 23 are big fillers, they ran out of content and put a bad ep. like 22 with no relation whatsoever to the plot and a funny yet useless ep. 23 and why put those ep. why not put two ep. with the the before mentioed guy that fighted Jin and was about to kill him untill his contract ended with the dead of his contractor, it would be better in my opinion, the ending was fine, i didn't get why she wanted to make the journey if she didn't do anything in the end (looked to me she didn't do anything more than being a plot device), didn't liked it but i understood that their journey ended when they made the promise come true, but in general the story was good.\
[b][u]Art & Animation[/u][/b]\
This kind of art style is not something that i like a lot but it was good i guess, i liked the design of certain characters but not all of them, but yeah it was good.\
[b][u]Sound[/u][/b]\
The sound is very good, tho i like hip-hop, i don't see how it fits in anime, it does something mediocre like in Tokyo Tribe but in Samurai Champloo is kind of an exception for the little times the music is played, and when is played is properly done; The OP is good, the ED gives a vibe of being dramatic for the videoclip in general; The VA is great.\
[b][u]Character[/u][/b]\
I liked a lot the characters because they have something, a chemistry that makes them work together and for their development through all the anime, they change a little, more for Mugen.\
-Mugen might seem like a cocky douche that only thinks on himself and wants to pick on anyone but there's depth in him, he can be kind sometimes without knowing he's being kind, his back story was really good.\
-Jin is a relaxed dude, he takes the things seriously and is really a good person despite his story (at first) makes you think he's somehow bad but at the end we get to know detailed his great deceiving back story.\
-Fuu is a kid hearted girl that wants to find herself and the samurai that smells like sunflowers for a big reason (for her) she's funny at times and other times she's creating trouble for both of them or herself.\
Well in this anime there are a lot of characters that are really great, the characters are the best from the anime, they succeed in being interesting and great in general.\
[b][u]Enjoyment[/u][/b]\
It was very entertaining, tho i wouldn't say i enjoyed eps. 22 and 23 that much (23 was hilarious i give that) but i had a very good enjoyment from this with the comedy and the fight scenes.\

    Substance over style, style over substance? Pretty visuals, or powerful plots? Glamorous production, or memorable themes? Sometimes it feels like writers and producers often ask themselves this question as a way of deciding what part of the show to sacrifice in service for another—a tightly written, genuinely complex narrative or brilliant visuals, dizzying cinematography and a high-flown music backing? Sometimes as a viewer it feels like we have to ask ourselves the same question—what I just watched, did I enjoy it superficially or was it something deeper than that? Why does one matter more than the other? Sometimes I have to ask myself if I\
          \
        simply liked the way a show looked, or did it affect me on a more personal, genuine level? \
But sometimes I’m left asking myself... was it both? \
Samurai Champloo is one of these rare, no-compromise, all-inclusive anime experiences that leaves you feeling every conceivable emotion. It leaves you feeling warm because of its sincere themes, it leaves you inspired by the gorgeous, vivid visuals and it leaves you entranced by the dazzling soundtrack. It’s a show that you can enjoy in any capacity, in any mood, and under any lens. Do you like audiovisuals? Do you like action? Poignancy? Romance? Satire? It’s all there. If there was ever a show to embody the concept of universal enjoyment, in theory Samurai Champloo would be it. \
A show can only go as far as its characters, so how far does Samurai Champloo go? The three main cast members were all treated fairly (although admittedly Mugen was given more treatment, being the main, main character) and they all had contrasting personalities. It's hands down one of the best use of character foils I've personally seen in anime; Mugen the big-mouthed and rogue criminal; Jin, the ice-cool and disciplined ronin; and Fuu, the brave yet petite teenager. Each of the characters are polar opposites of one another and because their personalities are written so consistently, their interactions are spectacularly entertaining to watch. The fashion in which they all bounce thoughts, dialogue and emotion off of one another is always enjoyable, but most importantly, natural as well. While as an anime emotions are dragged out and overplayed, it still feels oddly authentic—the characters are always true to how they are written so it never feels superficial. \
Following the characters was the plot; it was kept simple: look for the “sunflower samurai” and in the process embark on an action-packed, treacherous adventure of smiles, laughter, tears and blood. The core theme of the narrative is the notion that the journeys we travel in life are more often than not more enjoyable and important than the destination or goal we arrive at. The emphasis is on important, because, if our trio of a cast simply found the Sunflower Samurai without their arduous journey, none of them would have progressed as characters like they did in the original story. \
This is truly a special theme because of how easily it can be extrapolated to our lives—we all have dreams, ambitions and aspirations that we one day hope to achieve and while we fantasize and drool over the thoughts of achieving them, more often than not it won’t be the end goal itself that will give us the gratification. No, it’s something much more deep and sincere than that—it’s the shaky, uncertain path that you took to get there. The work, the emotions, the doubts, the failures, the small successes, everything that made reaching the end goal seem so impossible and difficult, that is what is truly gratifying. And like the show conveys to you… sometimes the end goal itself isn’t that special after all, and what is actually valuable, and what you actually take away from that long, exhausting journey… is the journey itself.\
In terms of format, Samurai Champloo is episodic, and it uses that format to its advantage. By making it very obvious that the events in each episode were self-contained tales, the show was able to drastically change its tone from suspense, action, poignancy, etc. without seeming jarring. It was able to tell tales of heartbreak, tales of redemption, tales of hilarity, all without seeming like it didn't know what it wanted to be, and in the process take you on a roller coaster of emotions that leave a lasting mark. \
The soundtrack of Samurai Champloo is phenomenal. It’s the part of the audiovisual experience that has to be addressed. Some of Nujabes’ best work, with low-fi beats and subtle hip-hop influences that juxtapose brilliantly with the traditional and orthodox Edo setting of the show. The ED song of Samurai Champloo, \"Shiki no Uta\", is also one of my favourite ED song of all time. \

    Fuu is a young orphaned girl doing her best to survive while working in a teashop. But her world as she knows it begins to unravel the minute a wandering Okinawan swordsman by the name of Mugen slouches into the shop while the daikon's abusive son and his rude cronies are also having some fun. When Fuu becomes the victim of their nasty games, she immediately offers Mugen fifty dango if he saves her from them. At the same time, a masterless samurai named Jin bears witness to the daikon's cruelty and quickly intervenes, easily dispatching the daikon's 'best of the best' guards. Mugen also\
          \
        beats everyone in the teashop up, starting with cutting off the arm of the man threatening Fuu, and demands better opponents from the daikon's son.\
Jin wanders in after the lordling threatens Mugen with his father's elite guard, unaware that Jin has already taught them all a lesson. Mugen mistakes Jin for the 'really strong' warriors but is quickly corrected. It makes no difference because Jin is now the strongest opponent available. To Fuu's chagrin, the pair of them immediately decide to duke it out in her teashop. The fight, however, ends abruptly when the man whose arm Mugen has just chopped off sets the place on fire.\
That is how the story starts, and how three strange, wildly different people get together.  Due to a strange series of events, Fuu has contracted both Mugen and Jin tol help her find the mysterious 'samurai who smells of sunflowers'. But how long can a young girl keep a pair of battle-crazy swordsmen under control, and how can they find a samurai by his scent alone (especially when Mugen doesn't even know what a sunlower is)?\
Samurai Champloo is Shinichiro Watanabe's next great animated venture that came right on the heels of Cowboy Bebop. It's quite funny and insane and just as initially apparently plotless as Bebop but once again proves to be a masterpiece in character studies. Unlike Bebop (which I can't help comparing Champloo to), there isn't much of an overarching plot. Though Fuu's quest to find the mysterious sunflower samurai is the main plot point, it isn't as heavy or deep or as present as the Spike/Vicious conflict throughout Bebop. Most of the time, it's just Jin, Mugen, and Fuu wandering across Japan, getting into trouble, starving, almost dying, and fighting with random people for no true purpose. It is occasionally dramatic, sometimes gory, and frequently violent, but it is never too heavy. It's more entertainment than actual story, although there are several stories and themes that intertwine.\
The art is breathtaking, of course. The landscapes and backgrounds are so amazingly beautiful and complete while animation is dazzlingly fluid. The fight scenes are absolutely excellent and exciting. The music appears inappropriate in theory but sounds perfect in actuality. Hip-hop and lounge music in a samurai anime? Was the director on crack? Not really. Just brilliant. With artists such as Tsutchie and NUJABES on board, the soundtrack is unexpectedly fitting and over-all quite good.\
My final verdict is: it's a good and entertaining anime but lacks the depth that made Cowboy Bebop a masterpiece. Still, I wouldn't pass Champloo up. The characters and setting are just too awesome and realistically done. However, some aspects of the stories and humor may be hard to grasp, as they are much too deeply rooted in Japanese history to easily translate or understand. And if you're one of those people who think that, after seeing one samurai anime, you've seen them all - trust me. You haven't. Samurai Champloo has it faults, certainly, but it is most definitely unique.\

    Overview:\
Cowboy Bebop is one of my favorite anime of all time, but what about Bebop's little brother, Samurai Champloo? Honestly...I felt that Champloo was a crushing disappointment and really isn't that good in comparison. I know that isn't a popular opinion to state, but it is truthfully how I feel. Now I am going to analyze this series in depth to further elaborate.\
Story: 7/10\
The story is that a little girl named Fu is wandering around trying to find a mysterious samurai that smells of sunflowers. On her journey, she meets the cool headed Jin and the Wildman Mugen. Jin fights with a traditional kenjutsu style,\
          \
        while Mugen integrates hip hop break dancing into his fighting style. Basically, he fights like Eddy Gordo from the Tekken series when some n00b is just mashing buttons. The plot is largely episodic much like Bebop, but the episodes aren’t nearly as interesting as the ones from Bebop. The main storyline is also quite a large leap backwards for Watanabe when compared to Bebop’s main story. Champloo tries to integrate chunks of Japanese history and traditional Japanese culture with American pop culture, especially rap and hip hop culture. This was a very ambitious and bold idea that could have worked, but I didn’t think it was executed in this series very well. The anime also touches on Christianity and its impact on Japanese history. Christianity is certainly handled by Watanabe with a LOT more care and respect than some other anime directors. I’m looking at you Anno!\
Characters: 7/10\
The characters are really pretty bland compared the memorable cast from Bebop. Jin and Mugen simply aren’t as cool or as likeable as Spike, Fu isn’t as awesome as Ed or Fay, and there is no villain with anywhere near the level of badass that Vicious brought. Having said all that, the characters aren’t terrible when compared to the average anime. They just can’t match up with the ones Watanabe created in his previous work. I did like how Jin and Mugen had the classic Red Oni/Blue Oni dynamic going on. Other than that, the character relations really didn’t interest me to a great degree. Even Fu’s relation with her father just didn’t feel that interesting.\
Art: 8/10\
The art is actually very good. I would say the art is by far the highlight of the series. The animation looks smooth and the series has aged quite well. No complaints here!\
Sound: 3/10\
One major difference between Bebop and Champloo is the choice of soundtrack: Jazz vs. rap. This is obviously a matter of personal taste, but I like Jazz in general more than I like rap. This is amplified quite a bit when the Jazz and Rap in competition is Yoko Kanno’s masterful Jazz OST vs. some very mediocre J-rap. Whereas Kanno’s use of big band Jazz in the style of Duke Ellington was highly impressive, the rap in Champloo is only a notch above the skill and quality of Mike Jones. If you don’t know who Mike Jones is…just type it into youtube. You can hate me later for introducing you to his “music”.\
Enjoyment: 5/10\
I enjoyed some episodes a lot more than I enjoyed others. I appreciate what the series was trying so hard to do, but I just couldn’t bring myself to actually enjoy it, no matter how much I wanted to.\
Overall: 6/10  (7+7+8+3+5)/ 5 = 6\
Samurai Champloo is by no means a bad anime series that you should avoid watching at all costs. That is NOT what I am trying to say. What I am saying is that it isn’t a particularly good series and it is a HUGE let down for fans of Bebop. If you want an anime with samurai, lots of rap, and a cross between Japanese and American hip hop culture, I would go with Afro Samurai. It is far superior to Samurai Champloo.",

    I cannot rate this show highly enough. Unlike many I found it more enjoyable than Cowboy Bebop. Although I think Cowboy Bepop is overall a better story this just had a great feel to it, something which is not tangible or easy to describe.\
First of all the music is brilliant throughout. It shouldn't work yet Old School Hip Hop blends seamlessly into Edo Japanese culture, it's extremely well delivered.\
I think this is a rare anime. Each episode, whilst technically linked, is almost independent from the rest. The plot of each episode has no real purpose in the grand scheme of the story but brilliantly allows\
          \
        us to see the characteristics, personalities, motives and history of the three main protagonists. Other than cowboy Bebop I have not seen another anime like this, it is exceptional.\

    Story:\
The story has a main central plot. Two samurai (although I think Mugen shouldn't really be considered a traditional samurai) and a teahouse waitress meet and the swordsmen end up accompanying her on a journey to seek out the samurai who smells of sunflowers. However, each episode, or occasionally every two episodes, really has its own story, but still falls into the main storyline perfectly because these episode stories are really the stories of their travels.\
In the beginning the whole sunflower samurai thing was somewhat vague and unexplained, but the truth of it becomes revealed throughout the series. I think it was a great story\
          \
        that was well developed and the ending was actually pretty good in my opinion. It really didn't leave you hanging at all because the main storyline was entirely resolved (despite what the idiots who believe it wasn't resolved say.)\
This story takes place in Japan's Edo Period (1603-1868,) however is really a revisionist historical series, meaning that the makers added some modern day elements that are anachronistic, predominately because the show contains hip-hop cultural attributes (i.e. break dancing, turntables, graffiti, Mugen's style, etc.) Also baseball did not arrive to Japan until 1878, ten years after the end of the Edo era, but the episode that contains a baseball game does fabricate a story that would make it possible. On the other hand, it does still actually show a lot of Edo historical aspects (such as the persecution against Christians, the nation's restriction of foreign affairs, Ukiyo-e paintings, and even a fictionalized version of a real life samurai (Miyamoto Musashi.) This blend of historical traits mixed with some modern themes makes the show very enjoyable.\
Art:\
Superb. The art style was very cool and the animation was nicely done. Consistently, throughout the whole series that is, the art was great, showing that they didn't slack off and really wanted to do a good job with this. The fighting scenes were brilliantly animated and always fluent, and the variety of camera angles and movements made it all very exciting.\
Sound:\
Yes, outstanding, definitely. The music is meant to reflect the hip-hop genre, and it does so very well. The OP is a cool song that fits the style as well as the samurai theme of the series. The ED is also a nice song for the show, and on several episodes there is an alternate ED, and then it goes back to the main ED, so the changes every once in a while are nice.\
The background music is top notch, especially during the action sequences. The music gets you so into the feel of the battle and makes it quite exciting. The sound effects are awesome. In the middle of the episodes when that screen shows up that says Samurai Champloo (where like a commercial would usually be,) as well during the actual episodes when one scene changes to another, there are cool sound effects like turntables and such that further add to the hip-hop feel.\
There's all this talk about the hip-hop, but maybe you don't like hip-hop. However, trust me, it makes the show so enjoyable and adds greatly to the overall feel of the show, generating a remarkable outcome.\
Character:\
The show primarily revolves around three characters: Fuu, Mugen, and Jin.\
Fuu is a 15 year old girl who lost her mother to illness and was always told she never had a father. Thus, at the start of the show, she was alone working as a waitress at a teahouse. It is her goal to find the samurai who smells like sunflowers, for a reason I can't disclose because I believe it'd be considered a spoiler. She loves to eat despite her small stature often bickers primarily with Mugen.\
Mugen is a swordsman who really helps give off the hip-hop feel. His fighting style incorporates a break dancing like art with swordsmanship, making it very cool, original, and enjoyable to watch. At the start of the show he's displayed as a lone wolf sorta guy who is a troublemaker always on the hunt for a tougher opponent.  Anything about his parents or family is basically unknown to him, however the focal point of his history is revealed, which is enough to satisfy the viewer.\
Jin is more of a classical, orthodox, and traditional samurai. He remains as a rather cryptic and sophisticated type of dude. Always being more calm and quiet, he differs greatly with Mugen, which is great. However, their sword skills are equal, and thus they agree that after their journey with Fuu is complete they would kill each other. Jin's history, like Mugen's, isn't given to you in its entirety, however I think more than enough is given about him, telling you basically what you need to know.\
The contrasting personalities and styles of this trio makes the story extremely enjoyable because it always creates great comedy and humor. I think everybody could come to love these characters due to their separate traits. The supporting characters are usually pretty interesting and perform their roles nicely, all that is needed for a supporting character really.\
Enjoyment:\
Unique and top-notch samurai sword fighting mixed with other weapons such as kusarigamas and the occasional firearm. Great humor produced by three significantly different characters. A story that every episode keeps you occupied and drawn in. A wonderful soundtrack and magnificent artwork that boost the quality of the show.\
What more could you ask for in a shounen series? It's a great action show that shouldn't be passed up, if anything simply for how incredibly enjoyable it is.\

    This show could have been something special on the same page as such classics like Ninja Scroll(NOT THE TV SERIES), Samurai X OVAs, Rurouni Kenshin, or Basilisk.\
Samurai Champloo could have been great like the classics above, but it ended up like Samurai Deeper Kyo. Just average, nothing special. There was nothing really special about the show. The characters were interesting, but not compelling.  By the end I didn't really care that much about anyone of them. The mix of comedy was the one pretty good part of the show. The music was just bad, no make that terrible. The action never got me excited.\
          \
        The animation was very good I'll give it that everything about that was great.\
 Now for the worst part the story throughout the 26 episodes were a big let down. The story had no real drama or drive, it never gave the characters any real emotion, and the ending was just plain anti-climatic. I like when shows end without no real resolution. It happens a lot in romantic anime, but even their character evolve and come to some sort of ending when the series ends. Samurai Champloo just ends without any king of resolution. \
Overall a decent anime series, but also a disappointing series.\

    Story: Well the fact that the whole thing starts off with them looking for a  Samurai that smells like Sunflowers is kinda weak, but what it grows into is something that only happens in a couple of shows. One thing about this story is it kept me guessing until the end of the series at what would happen. \
Animation: Personally I loved this style of animation it was very original and I have never seen a style like this again. But some people wont like this style so if you dont like it oh well.\
Sound: Although I am not a big fan of hip\

        hop music I do love this hip hop style. I don't know why. I think it is because they mix the action and sound together so well.\
Character: The two main characters are just great. They are both pretty funny and and girl that they are traveling with just adds to the formula.\
Enjoyment: Great fights, very funny parts and some very series parts that fit in perfectly.\
Overall: If you like swords and swordsmen then this is a must.\

    I promised to some friends that some day I would do a review on Samurai Champloo.\
And well, since the dough for the Nikuman is still rising, I might as well do this now. So, where to start?\
First of all, if you visit my profile you'll find out rather quickly that I'm not a big fan of Watanabe Shinichiro. Or his works. Still, I try to rate it as objective as possible. So, lets get started already.\
The first point on my list would be the story aspect, which I split up in three sections (something I'll do for every category, be prepared): The actual story, the\
          \
        setting used, as well as the execution of said story.\
Story 2/3: As you know from the synopsis, Fuu is searching for a 'samurai that smells like sunflowers'. Why she does that is left in the dark at first, but is a pretty promising start. It leaves a lot of options where to go with the story, and grabs your attention. On the other hand, this plot isn't anything special either, we have seen this plot before, and I can guarantee, we will see it again.\
Setting 1/3: I am a weaboo. And I f'n love japan, I love the Sengoku era, I love the Meiji era, so what could possibly go wrong, right? To be honest, while I like this time setting, I never felt like Watanabe made much use of it. It might as well have played in renaissance europe, or in space, or in medieval america or parts-unknown. It wouldn't make any difference to the story except the samurai being a knight, panther warrior, astronaut or whatever.\
Execution 1/3: Just like in Cowboy Bebop Watanabe nearly spends no time on developing his characters or story, but instead focusses on pointing out the differences between that time depicted and our own time, which he describes as better (Sidenote: Our time is not better than the past, each time has its own problems to tackle. But this is a discussion for some other time).\
The story is mostly episodic, with moreoften than not episodes, which absolutely do nothing to the overaching plot. So overall, lots of episodes felt to me like a total waste of time.\
So the overall story score is 5/10 (No, this is no error)\
The Art. This section contains the character designs, the Backgrounds, as well as the fluency of animation (especially in battlescenes).\
Character designs 1/3: To be honest, the character designs are the worst part of this anime, because quite frankly, they look unproportional. Especially Fuu's and Jin's heads.\
I feel like Jins head is way too thin for his body, while Fuu on the other hand has a rather broad head. Your typical head would be like 1/3 of the shoulders, but Fuu's head is big enough to fill over half of her shoulders. Jins head on the other hand is thin enough to only take 1/4 to 1/5 of his shoulders. This looks really weird (for reference, I took ep 25 7:17 as example).\
Also, in contrast to the background the characters are quite pale, with their skin being nearly white. The characters are (thats hard to describe, I hope I can get this across correctly) outlined pretty sharply, so they look like cut-out figures running over a paining. Which is a rather good transition...\
Background 2/3: ...because the background seems like a drawn painting which uses oil colors. Well, I'm not much of an artist though. Why is it not full score? Because I miss some clear contures. Even on distances like 10 meters or so, most objects are depicted as rough outlinings.\
Animation 2/3: This is probably the point I pondered on the most. So I will start the simple part. Outside of battlescenes the animation is just as good, as you'd expect. It isn't mindblowingly good, but it does it job. But now the fightingscenes... (again, I took ep 25 as reference) For some of the scenes I were pondering whether this is 2 or 3 points, and for some I were pondering whether I give 1 or 2 points... First of, the battle scenes are rather americanized. What does that mean, you wonder? The battleanimations certainly look flashy and all, but to a point where they sacrificed realism for action. Pretty much the same way as Hollywood does on a regular basis. As a kendoka myself, I obviously disliked that fact. Scenes I remember clearly are for example running on the sides of buildings, cutting whole stones with a kama, or single animated strikes with 3 or more after images of attacks. Don't get me wrong, other anime do this, too. But those aren't set in a (pseudo)realistic Meiji-era japan.\
Thats not too shabby for the art works at least, 6/10.\
The soundscore is pretty obvious. Voice acting (since I nearly never watch dubs, I'm just rating the japanese ones), BGM/OST, and OP/ED.\
Voice acting 2/3: With Saber as one of my favorites one would think, that I throw all rationalism out of my window right now, but unfortunately I dislike Kawasumi Ayako in her role as 'Damsel in distress'. It doesn't really fit her image, but obviously she's a good enough voice actress to make it at least work. Nakai Kazuya on the other hand is just as great as always. I mainly remember him from Gintama (Hijikata), and well... there is absolutely nothing I could criticize here. He hits the role of Mugen perfectly. Period. Sato Ginpei on the other hand is rather unexperienced, and for his particular role he works pretty well. He doesn't seem to emotional, but I can't remember Jin having emotional lines to begin with... Same for the rest of the cast, they definitely do their job good enough to not drag down the anime, but they don't blow off my head either.\
BGM/OST 0/3: I think I should mention this first - I.am.not.a.Hip-hop.Fan. Now it's out. Nonetheless. Anime like Peace Maker Kurogane prooved for me that Hiphop-Meiji is a viable combination, if used correctly. And as you already can guess from 'if used correcty' I don't think that Samurai Champloo did a good job with it's OST. Rather than supporting the themes or situations of the anime, the OST just went off and did its own thing. To put it simply, I felt like watching an anime, while at the same time having a random Hiphop CD in my CD Player. The music and the pictures were never in sync, at least thats what I feel like. Especially as fighting themes the BGM used felt really misplaced (I don't even need to write this anymore, but again ep 25).\
OP/ED 1/3: As mentioned earlier, Hiphop and Meiji is viable. Unfortunately I seriously disliked the OP 'Battlecry'. So much, that at some point I started skipping it. However, even though it is not my taste, I feel like it fits the anime. The EDs on the other hand are more to my taste, even if just by a small margin. Still, I rarely listened to any of those, so I won't dwell to long on this.\
Of course, the score went a bit down because music taste is subjective, but I think I tried my best to stay more on the objective side of things. Overall 4/10 for the Sound.\
Next is the characters-section... Short spoiler, I never came to like any of those characters.\
However. I rate for the initial character design, their development (both characters and relationships), as well as the relation/interaction between the characters.\
Initial character design 2/3: The anime starts with a cast of three completely different characters. Ditzy Fuu, mysterious Jin, and wild Mugen. They all have their points of interest, vived backgrounds, and are overall well rounded. Again though, without blowing your head off of excitement. The same goes for the introduced side characters. the episodes in which they appear deliver adequate information on their backgrounds, as well as reasons etc.\
Development 1/3: I... just wanted to write something witty, but I can't come up with anything! To be honest, if I compare the start and end traits of the characters and relations I reach just one conclusion: Next to nothing changed. Don't get me wrong, they definitely developed, but I don't feel like they would act different from before.\
Relations 2/3: Well, I already mentioned that all of the maincharacters act and think completely different. This obviously ends up in pretty interesting interactions as well. Unfortunately those interactions are as old as anime. Or even older. None of the situations are new or groundbreaking, but they are not bad either.\
So overall, its 6/10. (I don't want to compare the cast of Champloo and Bebop, which is pretty much identical)\
Finally, my Enjoyment. This is the only section which is, and always will be, completely subjective. I decide on how much I liked what I saw, how much I want a continuition (or in ongoing anime how much I look forward to the next episode), whether or not I would recommend it to friends, and whether I would woatch it again (and how often i would watch it again).\
So, much ado about nothing...\
Did I like it? No.\
Do I want a continuiton? No.\
Do I recommend it? Depends on who asks me, but I wouldn't recommend it to most people I know at least.\
Would I watch it again? Please.\
So, Enjoyment ist pretty much 1/10. I can't remember myself even smiling once during this anime.\
But here's the point. I don't really feel like rate something bad, just because I dislike it.\
For the overall rating I won't use my own Enjoyment, but an average of 5 pts.\
Just for reference, an enjoyment of 1 would result in an Overall score of 4.4, the maximum enjoyment would result in an Overall score of 6.2.\
As usual I appreciate feedback to improve my reviews.\
And now, my dough is done, time to eat.\
Oh, tl;dr:\
Story 5/10 - Mediocre story of a girl searching a certain person.\
Art 6/10 - Fluent animation with unrealistic movement\
Sound 4/10 - Good voiceacting, but no synergy of sound and picture\
Char 6/10 - Well round cast, without much development.\
Enjoy depends on watcher.\

\"Can't really think too much of anything right now because I'm still reeling from Nujabes news...I'll try though.\
Don't bother comparing it to Cowboy Bebop - it's inferior to CB. It's a nice series but nonessential. Fu is not Faye (don't even think about it) - fufufu. The ending was meh. If you try to compare it to CB; I'd say \"Bang!\"\
No problem with beginners taking on this one. It's peopled by colorful characters and even more colorful palette. Being Manglobe, it's an eye candy. Some are saying the dubs are very good but I've only seen the subs.\" - TsukikageRan\

\"I'm still a compassionate fan after so long! Mostly, because it gave me the best impression of anything animated I ever saw back then. I just loved the weirdness of the main characters (i.e. I don't know anybody's last name) and the others like the painter, detective, old fisherman...the undead people. And I love Jin...I never liked an anime character that much before. D=\
Oh and I actually liked the ending, since I can't really think of anything that I wished was changed.\" - zewho\
\"some \"arcs\" are interesting or funny, some \"arcs\" are terrible (*cough mushroom cough*).\
It isn't a consistant anime. It has an average main plotline and average background stories. Storytelling was above average.\
However, it does convey its own style through characters and music quite effectively. (Even though those characters and that style isn't the sort i like.)\
Action was good too - reasonably fluid and somewhat realistic movements.\
Essential? I wouldn't exactly say that, but if you've seen a decent amount of anime, it is highly recommended for you to watch it to appreciate its unique style and to some extent the animation.\
Compared to cowboy bebop... well i'm not exactly a fan of cowboy bebop, so i preferred samurai champloo over it. But they are similar. They both use a genre of music rarely used in anime and convey their own style. They're also both inconsistant in that some parts are exceedingly entertaining (well... maybe not in bebop) while other parts are like applying chloroform to yourself. Samurai Champloo's characters are probably slightly more exaggerated than those in Cowboy Bebop.\
I would also say that Samurai Champloo's popularity far exceeds its quality (though not as much as bebop).\" - dxthegreat\
\"Aww helll naaaaw. The greatness of Bebop cannot be duplicated no matter how hard one tries. This anime said exactly one thing to me \"I wanna be like Bebop.\"\
If this came before Bebop, I probably would have liked it more. Think of it like this, there is a really awesome old brother who gets laid 24/7 and has lots of money, and there's the nerdy younger brother who still lives with his parents and has no friends.\" - LV69_Squirtle\

\"First of all, sorry for my english. -_-'\
I really enjoyed this anime. There was an entertainment ,truly sad, awesome struggle and just beautiful moments. Champloo is very colourful and rhythmic. Sometimes fast, sometimes slow. But story goes the way it should.\
I love \"Battlecry\" and \"How you feel\" tracks ))\
Comparing to Bebop, Champloo isn't better but... You know even thinking of Spike doing me so sad. Bebop more serious, more adult I guess.\" - freakylem\
\"Samurai Champloo became one of my favourite series when I watched it. I loved the characters (especially Jin:3) and the incredible action scenes among with the great animation. Storytelling was ok what I remember.. Also I payed attention to the funny, sometimes subtle facial expressions that the characters showed, just like in Cowboy Bebop.\
The thing was, I actually didn't know that Bebop was Champloo's predecessor or something until after I had watched the series (meaning Champloo). So, I didn't end up comparing the series with one another while watching Champloo, which was a good thing. ^^\
In my opinion, this series is a must-see at least for those who like anime with action and samurais.. I recommend this for beginners too ;)\" - chibber\

    I just finished it and I have this feeling to write a review about it so I will. So when I started watching the series, I thought to myself it's not that bad. But I was wrong, it's actually impeccable. It's an action, comedy thriller. In the start it seems the characters don't have much to them, but you do realize they are unique, they might a few elements that resemble the generic anime types but in the end they are unique. As the story goes on, you get to realize it's just more than action, comedy and music. It has great character development, there's\
          \
        a depth in it . The basic plot is that three people meet and go on a journey to find a samurai who smells of sunflowers. So most of the episodes seem off topic but they are necessary, they are not only entertaining but give some interesting messages at times, sometimes in subtle ways, some times they give them as bluntly as they can. It is very fascinating to watch and the ending is very heart-touching and moving. It has some mature themes, like prostitution, drugs, lots of violence, religious extremism, racism etc. These themes are shown in an natural way and they are presented in a lighter fashion , it's a historic anime so they were in a way necessary. But don't mistake it for being historically accurate, it is indeed all fiction and gets really weird at times. But watching it is an experience you should reward yourself. If you can watch stuff with serious topics like that conveyed in a light manner, then I would highly recommend it to you. You'll like it whether you are into it's respective genres or not. But that's my opinion, you might or might not like it, but it's worth giving a shot. And remember to watch at least 2 episodes before you form a judgement over the series as it's magnificence depends on the characters and their character development, in my opinion. \

    I am probably one of the very few people that have watched Samurai Champloo before Cowboy Bebop. I find this great as I don't end up comparing the two as they are directed by the same person, Shinchiro Watanabe. Because Cowboy Bebop is highly acclaimed as one of the best Anime out there, it would not help out Champloo's case as it would be frowned upon for not being as good as Cowboy Bebop. Anyways, onto the Review!\
Samurai Champloo is a 2004 anime directed by Shinchiro Watanabe and produced by studio Manglobe, which follows the story of 3 main protagonists; Mugen, Jin, and Fuu as\
          \
        they \"coincidentally\" run into each other and set off on Fuu's goal of reaching the \"Samurai that smells of Sunflowers.\" This anime is set in a Fictional Edo period of Japan, with many hip hop elements mixed in with traditional Japanese culture. \
 Even though Champloo does have a main goal, this series is mainly episodic, focusing on the actual journey than the goal itself. This does hurt the story a bit as it feels like the end goal is just a plot element to keep the story going. However, each episode, though rather formulaic at times, is very intriguing with the various people they meet on the way and the various struggles they have. There are also many comedic elements in Champloo, which are for the most part hit and miss. There is one scene in all of Champloo that is pretty hilarious, and you will know what I'm talking about. \
As someone who has been watching more recent titles, it is hard to judge Champloo as it is a 2004 anime, and production quality has soared since that time. However, you can easily tell that the quality on the animation was top notch at it's time. All the fight scenes are absolutely beautiful, with everything being so smooth and captivating. There are few times when you can notice the quality of the animation drop during less action-oriented scenes, but are fairly rare. \
Soundwise, Samurai Champloo does something completely different that I personally have never seen in an anime. It's main genre of music is hip hop, with some \"Traditional\" Japanese music thrown in. I myself am not a big fan of Hip Hop, but it does go well with the show, and I did enjoy it for the most part. The opening took a while to get used to, but I now regard it as one of my favourites. The ending is also very catchy, and could even be better than the opening track if Hip Hop isn't in you're musical tastes. \
The characters of Samurai Champloo are it's weakest element. You have Mugen, the badass samurai that fights in a completely unorthadox style and takes no shit from nobody. Then we have Jin, who is basically the polar opposite of Mugen, where he is a more traditional samurai and doesn't talk \
as much, and acts a lot more calm and collected. Then we have Fuu, a girl who gets kidnapped a lot, eats everyone out of house and home, and is completely depended on Mugen and Jin. This is ironic because Fuu is the only one that gets any character development. There is also very little backstory for all of the main protagonists, which is pretty disappointing. I do however like the contrast that Jin and Mugen have with each other, and provides a sort of balance. And even though Mugen's character is static throughout the series, it is just plain fun to watch him spew out profanity and watch his obscure way of fighting.\
Overall, this anime is just cool. It has many flaws in itself, but the sheer badassery of it all just makes it a fun experience. The whole historical fiction thing might throw a few people off, but I do recommend this quite highly. Thanks for reading my first anime review, I hope you found this helpful!\

    Samurai+Hip-Hop can do something wrong ?\
starting overview :\
STORY:\
The premise simple is find a samurai. The series is pseudo episodic each episode has stories but still have a lineal  story. The episodic stories are good~. Some episode are very good , other are decent , meh ,  but mostly episodes are good.\
 I need to do talk about the start question:\
Samurai+Hip-Hop can do something wrong ? the answer is ...... NO and YES \
The mix style  is  little shocking  really  you can  have a idea of samurais dancing and fighting hip hop  REALLY some drop the show and\
          \
        give negative point for the mix \
but the mix of Samurai+Hip-Hop still a singular premise , very creative, the choreography of the battle are  singular and creative .\
CHARACTERS: \
The characters are cool and charismatic ...... its really all....\
from the begin to the end are the same cool and charismatic character \
they only has a principal personality we don't know much about them  , \
As I said the characters don't  change but  how the story go they have very  good interactions .\
CONCLUSION:\
7/10 GOOD\
Charismatic\
Is cool  rule of cool and pure fun \
its not want to be more than they are and for what is, is good\

    I just finished watching Samurai Champloo, and a few things come to mind. One, I originally watched the series because of a profound enjoyment of Shinichiro Watanabe's other directorial effort, Cowboy Bebop. On the surface, Champloo seems a lot like Bebop - a stylized fantasy view of a typical genre mixed with a contemporary and unique soundtrack.\
For Watanabe's shows, music plays a vital role in expressing the atmosphere and character of the setting, and is very much a character in and of itself. Such was the case in Cowboy Bebop, and Samurai Champloo attempts to do the same. Only, this time, Champloo comes short of\
          \
        Bebop's example, and fails in a few ways.\
Story: This is the story of three wanderers who meet up and join forces to search for a \"samurai who smells of sunflowers\". I won't give away much here, but I found the plot to be incredibly disjointed and hollow. The only real antagonists make themselves known within the last 6 or so episodes of the series, and most of the preceding episodes are pretty much filler. This is a series that could have benefitted from a shortening in length to perhaps 13 episodes to preserve plot integrity. The last handful of episodes redeem the plot somewhat, but a handful of awesome doesn't quite make up for the bucketful of yawns that precede it.\
Art: I found the artwork in Samurai Champloo to be pretty good as a whole. The swordfighting scenes specifically are fantastic, and motion is fluid and exciting, particularly when Mugen fights someone. Thumbs up here.\
Sound: As mentioned before, Watanabe's previous work, Cowboy Bebop, successfully married jazz music with sic-fi to create something altogether unique and creative. Champloo attempts to do the same with samurai and hip-hop, but the end result doesn't impress as much as one would think. A much better effect could be had by just watching the fight scenes of this show while playing a Wu-Tang CD. Sometimes the music does not fit the scene, and sometimes the music for a dramatic scene is a bit too subtle. Hip hop as a genre really shouldn't be subtle, and the high hopes promised by the opening theme are not lived up to by the background music. Also, should the ending theme have been a sappy J-pop song? If you were gonna do the whole hip hop thing, go the whole way.\
Character: The three main characters are interesting, but I cannot give too high a score here because there really isn't a lot of development of any antagonists. All of the character-moments of the series involve the three heroes, and while they are fairly developed, it seems as though some questions are left unanswered. Each main character had a serviceable background story, but their pasts seemed glossed over a bit. Some funny moments are had at the expense of Mugen particularly, and the different natures of the protagonists lead to some memorable scenes. However, as I mentioned before, these characters are the ONLY ones that are developed. Some characters appear for an episode or two and are never explained or developed in the time that they're there (the secret policeman comes to mind)\
Enjoyment: After all the nitpicking, I enjoyed the series, mostly because of the few awesome tense moments and the sword fighting. This series has a lot of flaws, and is overall a disappointment for those expecting another Cowboy Bebop, but low expectations and a taste for fluid fight choreography can garner a good bit of enjoyment out of this series.\
Overall: I'd say rewatchability is about medium. I wouldn't mind watching some of the major fights again, but unlike Cowboy Bebop, there are definitely skippable episodes upon rewatching for this show. Although enjoyable, Watanabe van do better - which leaves me still searching for the perfect samurai anime. \

    Most anime that becomes popular in the west are somewhat lacking in social commentary on Japanese culture and history. Indeed, Fullmetal Alchemist is more German than Japanese in most respects, Naruto, though certainly uniquely Japanese with its references to historical and mythical ninjas as well as Shinto mythology, was lacking in any social commentary, and shows like Shingeki no Kyojin are remarkably European in setting. Samurai Champloo is an exception to this rule in that it contains heavy references to Japanese history in order to drive home social commentary about modern Japanese culture. Shinichiro Watanabe’s, of Cowboy Bebop fame, second major series is set in\
          \
        late Edo-era Japan in which social change was being driven by increasing pressure from the west to change, and several moments in Samurai Champloo reflect this and analyze how modern Japan is continually being shaped by this clash of cultures. \
The series starts out with a young girl named Fuu working in a tea shop who spills tea on a samurai customer, then a rambunctious samurai (actually, he isn’t really a samurai due to his lower class status) named Mugen who rushes to her defense. Mugen also picks a fight with a quiet, reserved ronin named Jin, and the two proceed to destroy the tea shop and kill the magistrate’s son. They are sentenced to death, but Fuu saves the two on the condition that they help her find “the samurai who smells of sunflowers.”\
Despite its incredible social commentary and great potential for plot development and characterization, however, Champloo ultimately falls flat in these departments. The plot’s pacing is very unevenly distributed, with virtually no advancement from episodes two to twenty-two then suddenly rushing the overarching plot to climax and conclude in the final episodes. Indeed, Champloo almost fully lacks a plot for the majority of the series and embraces a quasi-episodic format. This, of course, isn’t necessarily a bad thing; after all, episodic anime are often among the best such as Mushishi. If Watanbe had stuck with an episodic series or had opted for a more western plot-driven anime, Champloo could’ve been much more successful; however, ultimately the series can’t make up its mind as to whether it is plot-driven or episodic, and that detracts from its artistic quality significantly.\
The characters are also heavily lacking in this series, for similar reasons to the plot. The only three major reoccurring characters throughout the entire series are Mugen, Fuu, and Jin, none of whom are very well-written or compelling. Fuu often comes off as helpless, whiny, and selfish, and her motivations are not explained at all until the very end of the series. Jin is almost completely flat and lacking in personality, though he does have a far better developed backstory than Fuu; unfortunately, this is revealed in somewhat of a contrived manner only through dialogue and flashbacks in the middle of a battle, which gives him the feel of a bad shounen character. Mugen is the best developed of the three major characters, with his backstory revealed slowly throughout the series in a believable manner and the most likable personality of the three. He also is the only one who’s somewhat dynamic, starting out completely selfish and moving towards a bit more empathy by the end. However, his and Jin’s motivations for going on the journey are not very well explained and it’s somewhat not believable that they would embark on such a journey and stay with it for so long in the first place. Despite the problems with the plot, some of the episodes are simply incredible in terms of plot and social commentary, particularly the one about the gay Dutchman, and the one revolving around St. Xavier’s followers.\
What Champloo lacks in the traditional elements of (western) storytelling, it makes up for in its execution, in directing style, animation, and soundtrack. Watanbe has truly cemented himself as a master of cinematography with the innovative camera shots, transition sequences, and battle scenes. It is remarkably difficult to find a well-directed sword fight in any film or television series, however Watanbe was extremely impressive in his directing of the fight scenes, particularly near the end. Further, the pillow shots that transition between scenes are often as gorgeous as they are innovative.\
The animation to Champloo is also significantly above average. The background sets are a gorgeous style that manage to be both impressionistic and realistic at the same time. Unfortunately, some of the character designs are over-detailed and poorly animated, particularly most of the middle-aged male side-characters throughout the series. However, its inconsistent quality in character designs is more than made up for in its background sets and the fluidity of motion in the battle sequences.\
The soundtrack is one of the most notable features of this anime. It mostly consists of anachronistic hip-hop beats by Japanese rapper Nujabes that contrast with the historical setting of the anime. The anachronism, however, works and connects modern Japanese culture’s interactions with the west with the clash of cultures experienced late in the Edo era. Though the hip-hop references within the show can sometimes become a little overbearing (characters beatboxing and an episode about tagging were not necessary), but the soundtrack is overall among the best all-time in anime. The introduction song, “Battlecry,” is particularly noteworthy for its great rapping akin to Rakim Allah or Nas and addictively good hip-hop beat.\
Overall, Samurai Champloo is definitely a good anime. It certainly lacks in terms of plot and character development, but the incredible artistic decisions make it well worth watching. This is a prime example of a subpar plot executed to perfection. Further, though this isn’t primarily a comedy, it can occasionally be hilarious and is thoroughly enjoyable. But the best element of this anime, by far, is its commentary on modern Japanese culture, particularly with respect to religion and sexuality.\

    Brought to use from Shinichiro Watanabe, who most people will remember for Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo is a fantastic looking fusion of Feudal Japan with a contemporary feel, but what lies underneath the surface?\
The plot begins when Fuu Kasumi, a waitress in feudal japan, is living a fairly normal life...riiight before the brash and arrogant vagabond Mugen decides to crash there for some tea, bringing in quite a few mooks and then our other male lead, the straight faced and cool Jin, to end up entirely wrecking the place and nearly getting them both executed. With some words and some coin flips, Fuu hires Mugen\
          \
        and Jin as her bodyguards while she journeys the land to find a mysterious sunflower scented samurai.\
Story-wise, the show is primarily episodic, but tries to have a building plot throughout it involving the sunflower scented samurai and Jin's past. To be honest, though, this mostly ended up amounting to nothing in the end, as the stuff teased in the ending is largely obvious before it even happens and does not amount to all THAT much, mostly on the Jin/Mugen side. This might not be such an issue, except the series tends to tease it out quite a lot over the course of its show, which makes it feel like it is trying to build up to more: This makes the episodic nature feel a bit less fun and the self-contained plots trying to lead into this end up working less. It was particularly tiresome to see the end of the show use this to poor effect, as dramatic leadups to the finale get interrupted halfway through for silly and bizarre episodic plots, which severely hurts the overall narrative and really helped tarnish the story for me. It gets buoyed up by many of the episodic plots being quite solid, at least. One issue is that all of this makes the show very slow feeling, which also hurt it for me.\
Character-wise, the main trio of Jin, Mugen and Fuu are all pretty well done, although I feel Fuu could have gotten a bit more focus/depth to her. Jin and Mugen's sharp contrasts nonetheless mixed with many similiarites is a very effective use of the having characters be Foils, although I feel both Jin and Mugen suffer slightly from the plot's developement. The one shot characters are hit and miss, with some great ones like Sara and the gay Hollander, some good-but-not-amazing ones like Mukuro and some really memetic ones like Francisco. The hits weren't large enough to help compensate for the pacing issues and lack of overall strong narrative.\
One of the issues I overall had with the show is that the investment I had in the characters was somewhat limited by how the show did not explore them a ton, feeling a bit more like a \"monster of the week\" style show. Probably one of the bigger examples of this is Jin, as there was a lot of potential to explore the ramifications of his past, but it ultimately mostly gets some token stuff in the story before the admittedly quite cool fight at the end. Fuu also did not get as many focus episodes as I would want and remains a bit too static throughout the series.\
One thing this show undeniably has is top notch presentation. The artwork, even about 12 years later as of this writing, is superb and rivals or surpasses a lot of anime that has come past it, with interesting and well drawn character designs for both the beautiful and ugly alike, very well choreographed (although sadly usually short) fights, great facial expressions and even the ability to adapt the style to do things like show traditional Japanese artistic styling. This is combined with a really superb score: Pretty sure that everyone knows about the hip-hop beats and stylings, but less known is that this show actually incorporates a lot of traditional Japanese folk into the mix, and then when you get to some of the combat tracks which can range from graceful to rock, this show spans an impressive amount of genres and manages to do them all quite well, with the OP \"Battlecry\" being especially memorable with the striking visuals, and an impressively graceful ED. \
Still, while the impressive visuals are really nice, the story ends up lackluster, and helps limit the investment of me into these characters by hurting how much I can connect to them because of the shallow exploration of their characters. If you want an episodic, sometimes wacky, sometimes action-y show, then Samurai Champloo will meet your desires, but if your interest lies in the set up they provide in the story and how it evolves in the story, you will find yourself disappointed. It is, if nothing else, enjoyable. \

    Its hard to find an anime that doesn't piss me off either with bullshit explanations as to why shit happens, dumbass characters that wont die or a weak ass plot. Hence, my list of anime favs is pretty damn small. However, i gotta say Samurai Champloo is one of the least infuriating animes Ive ever seen. \
With dynamic characters, a whirlwind plot, surprisingly well drawn fight scenes and a mature, realistic perspective of the world, i think this anime has what it takes to be a classic, and I consider it as such. Plus, for the musically inclined, such as myself, the soundtrack's pretty funky\
          \
        too. All in all its an entertaining mix of pure comedy and thrilling action. Good Stuff -this gets my stamp of approval.\

    The anime was created by Manglobe and directed by Shinichirō Watanabe, the man who directed Cowboy Bebop, another critically acclaimed series. Watanabe is known for his style of mixing different concepts together which he did brilliantly in Samurai Champloo, blending together elements of hip-hop, a Edo Japan setting and a lot of modern day references, true historical events and characters.\
The story features 3 main characters. Fuu, a girl who is on a quest to find \"the samurai that smells of sunflowers\". Mugen, one of the samurai Fuu saved, a carefree vagabond and anti-hero with a break dance/capoeira fighting style, who doesn't really care about anything\
          \
        other than fighting. And Jin, a ronin with a conventional samurai behavior and a traditionalfighting style who has a dark past that haunts him. The three meet in Fuu's hometown where the samurai duo helps her in a stress situation with the local samurai band,but soon finds themselves ready for execution for killing the magistrate's son. Fuu then steps in and returns the favor and the three take off to a journey to find \"the samurai that smells of sunflowers\" that Fuu is desperately searching for.\
The animation in the anime is great, and i really enjoyed it. It looks like a mix of graffiti art and old school manga which is done by implying thick lines and a bit strange color scheme. Intense battle scenes start at the very beginning and don't stop till the story ends. The way Mugen moves and fights is really refreshing in the genre, and I enjoyed watching his fight, but don't think that the Jin battles are boring, fans of kenjutsu will love him as he is one bad ass sword fighter.\
Characters are fun and very easy to attach too. There is the girl, the bad boy, and the stoic bushido all tied together in one hell of a ride. Main char development is something I point out as the flaw of the show, as i have the feeling it could have been done better and in more detail. Every episode has some side characters which are always refreshing and you don't get that feeling that the developers are just recycling old ideas, or getting fed up of doing the series, which i sometimes get when watching a show.\
The music theme is somewhat not standard for an anime series, as it is hip hop themed, and despite not being a fan of the genre I found it refreshing and interesting. It also went along with the whole gangstarish feeling they gave to some characters and settings. Moments of a more traditional approach with a Japanese sound flow perfectly and really give a deeper feeling to the scene. It is one of the shows that I can say the music deserves to be praised as its best part, which gets even more weight when I say that all the other aspects are top quality as well.\
\
This is a great show and the feeling it leaves after you have watched it is that the time was certainly not a waste of time. It has its moments of serious and the comic part which go well with one another and keep you entertained for a 26 episode period. Samurai and hip hop lovers as well as action lovers will highly enjoy Samurai Champloo, but others should pick it up as well because of its interesting and original story, the humorous elements which are hilarious,  fighting scenes you will like even if you are not an action fan, and truly a great overall watching experience. I would recommend it to any true anime lover, just don't expect the nacama, friend power shonen part as this is not a generic shonen, and if you are still in a phase that you HIGHLY ENJOY Bleach, Naruto and such titles you should not watch this and ruin the joy you would have if you watched it at the right time(I still watch shonen and find it fun but I do not HIGHLY ENJOY them, there is a difference). \

    Samurai Champloo is a funky train. It's gonna take you up and down, all over a parallel Edo period Japan. \
The train conductors? Two extremely skilled swordmen, two completely different styles. There's Mugen. A loud, rather simple man, with a more unorthodox fighting style. There's Jin, the refined, quiet type, closer to your idea of a samurai who earns the respect of others. Both of them have to carry their own weight; be it that of coming from a tough place, or that of being too skillful for others to stand it. Ah, there's Fuu too. She's there, being all cutesy and stuff with her\
          \
        ``Mo!`` 's and ``Uso!`` 's. Don't you dare look down on her though. She is the link that holds this chain of unlikely travellers together, after all. And well, you've seen a lot of girls with huge appettites in anime before, but this one WILL turn fat after eating a lot. Her desire to find ``The samurai that smells of sunflowers`` was what gave the reason for their journey to begin. And what a journey it was.\
It's the little things that made Samurai Champloo special to my eyes. A little touch of realism, where actually our characters more than often do have to worry about things often skipped as trivial; like having to earn money for food and lodgings. How the creators constantly turn on the style. How the characters move so smoothly, the fights are quite a treat with the fluid motions and the polished choreography.\
I was a bit doubtful about the suitability of this music genre for a story about samurai. Needless to say, I found it hard to skip the opening theme after a while. It is one of those little somethings that add to the charm of the show. Same goes for the ending theme, earning you a bit of nostalgia as it sees you off, before you hop onto this train again, heading for the next station. Through out the show the music is just so good. Be it gritty, chill out tunes, or hauntingly sad songs like Obokuri Eemui.\
What is there not to like in Samurai Champloo? Well... Most \"arcs\" are two episodes long, at the most. There's no typical structured built up, where a group of powerful villains exists, and everything seems to lead to the final confrontation with them. Mugen is a streetwise antihero himself anyway, slashing officials without a second thought if they happen to get in his way. It's understandable that not everyone finds this approach appealing. For the rest, travelling with two strangers in pursuit of something as vague as ``the samurai who smells of sunflowers``? It's enough reason in itself. Here it's all about the journey. The places you see, the people you meet, the things you taste.\
So the three travellers will traverse Japan for a clue on the man that Fuu has to find. They'll work, steal and fight for a taste of the local delicacies, Fuu will momentarily turn chubby when she overdoes it. What about the people they meet? Any memorable journey requires a sequence of meetings with extraordinary persons. Our trio will meet a Dutch man searching for..something different. A housewife whose beauty radiates too brightly to be blurred by her husband's failures. The troubled young men who take the wrong path in life and, cruel as it might be,  have to pay. Lethal, beautiful women. Your occasional powerful opponents. More lethal women. And umm..remember the forementioned realism? Scratch that when you witness a tribute to the zombie culture; or when eager..US navy officers choose as the deciding factor for the invasion of Japanese coasts a game of..ninja baseball, quick to turn into a massacre; finally, keep an eye for the references and the various legends making cameo appearances in a Forrest Gump-ish manner.\
Still, there's an end to everything, and eventually for their journey to be meaningful, they'll have to find ``the samurai that smells of sunflowers``. After each of the three travellers takes care of what they have to, this train can briefly stop. It's only Death and Rebirth after all, right?\

    one of the things i missed most about living in the usa is watching anime on [adult swim] every night. hell, i remember all the times i spent staying up until 3am watching episodes of inuyasha and cowboy bebop when i should've been sleeping because i had class in the morning. but if there's one anime that i remember fondly, it's samurai champloo. i don't want to be \"that guy\" who says that the ost is what i remember the most, but that's definitely what first comes to mind.\
i remember back in 2004/2005 when i was still attending high school and there was this massive\
          \
        hip-hop and reggaeton craze that swept pretty much every corner of the united states (and even my home country of india, since it seemed that virtually all bhangra music seemed to have a rap/hip-hop twist to it). samurai champloo started airing around this time period and i remember it so well because of all the promotional adverts on [adult swim] which featured that instrumental hip-hop soundtrack.\
considering the fact that i was an impressionable teenager at the time who had nothing but 50 cent and eminem songs on his ipod mini, it was no surprise that i loved the hell out of this show. but looking back, i liked it for the wrong reasons. yes, the soundtrack is odd and yet works extremely well for a show with this kind of style. but there are many other reasons to like this show which i ended up finding out upon re-visiting this programme after 8-9 years. of course, i also found many reasons to criticise this programme as well but let's cross that bridge when we get to it.\
at its core, samurai champloo can be viewed as cowboy bebop's younger brother. it's brash, impulsive, doesn't always make the right decisions and sometimes mimics its older brother much to our annoyance but we still love it anyway. unlike cowboy bebop, samurai champloo is much less serious. come to think of it, there weren't many serious episodes at all. episodes tend to vary between being action-centric and comedy-centric. unfortunately, this leads to quite a few problems.\
cowboy bebop's biggest shortcoming is the fact that it's episodic in nature, and samurai champloo opts for a similar approach. however, it does have *some* semblance of a plot. the goal of mugen, jin, and fuu is to find the samurai who smells of sunflowers (which STILL sounds like a ridiculous name almost a decade later). the episodic nature is thus forgiveable since the show focuses more on the journey rather than destination itself. but it isn't all good.\
i said before that shows of episodic nature tend to suffer from this problem of having episodes that vary wildly in terms of quality and that's further exacerbated in this show. considering the fact that it varies between being action-centric and comedy-centric, there exists a drastic margin of error. i'm biased toward the action episodes rather than the comedy episodes since some comedy episodes like the one which involved baseball (yes. that actually happened) were just plain average while other episodes like the one where there's a graffiti battle between two gangs and mugen learns how to read (yes, that actually happened) were fucking hilarious.\
the action episodes are of particular note since it gets to showcase the absolutely gorgeous art and animation that champloo has. since the backgrounds moved in real time, the sword fights were intense as all hell. couple that with mugen's unorthodox fighting style and some rather bizarre scenarios that led to some intense fights, and you've got a happy desi anime nerd. speaking of art/animation, manglobe did a spectacular job animating this series. everything looks absolutely gorgeous and despite coming out in 2004, this holds up amazingly well 10+ years later (although some characters' faces tended to go off model from time to time, especially in shots that were at a small distance).\
now with that said, let's go back to the characters. unlike bebop, we aren't really given much in the way of recurring characters so we're pretty much stuck with mugen, jin, and fuu for the entire run. unfortunately, they pretty much remain static throughout the course of the show. i mean, mugen and jin start out wanting to kill each other and over time, they actually tolerate one another but that's about it. as for fuu, she is quite literally useless. the only purpose she serves is being a walking plot device. oh, and being a generic damsel in distress. mugen and jin on the other hand are pretty damn likeable but sometimes it feels like they rely too much on their \"gimmicks\" (what with mugen being a vulgar, illiterate break-dancing swordsman and jin being a reserved ronin with an extremely orthodox fighting style). other than that, not much to complain about here.\
now we get to my favourite part of champloo: the audio. put it short, samurai champloo is basically flawless in this section. i know so many people who hate rap and hip-hop, and yet love the everliving shit out of this show. also, despite comprising of predominantly hip-hop music, the show does a good job of not shoving it in your face (most of the time). the background music consists of amazing instrumental hip-hop tracks done by the likes of nujabes (may he rest in peace), fat jon, and forces of nature and i must say that i wish these three did more anime soundtracks, but i guess that's too late now.\
the dub is also really good stuff, but that's no surprise since this is bebop's little brother. steve blum does an excellent job voicing mugen (although his voice work did remind me a bit too much of spike spiegel from time to time) as did kirk thornton as jin. i really don't understand why some people give this dub shit since it's pretty damn good. can you really go wrong by a dub done by funimation (or was it geneon? i keep forgetting who licensed this show when)?\
on the whole, samurai champloo isn't perfect and in many ways, i can see why people would give this show crap. at the same time, it definitely has quite a few merits to stand on. say what you will about this show being a carbon copy of bebop, but there's one thing that this show has that bebop will never have: its style. going back to that little brother analogy, it does borrow quite a bit from its predecessor, but they are ultimately two totally different shows. if you're in the mood for something with a lot of entertainment value you'll surely remember for a long time, i cannot recommend this show enough. in fact, i highly recommend buying it on blu-ray (provided you have the means to watch something on blu-ray). some shows simply \"take\" to blu-ray with no two ways around it and champloo is one of them.\

    I had been wanting to watch this anime for a while and I really don't know why I didn't dwell on watching it earlier. This anime, is amazing. Think I'm going overboard? No. I'm not, because there wasn't a single thing that bothered me about it. You know how sometimes, you watch certain anime's nowadays and you're just like...''well why didn't they just....?'' or you even soon doubt how something doesn't really go right? In Samurai Champloo, I didn't have that ''off'' feeling. It went smoothly, and I enjoyed it all the way until the end.\
The characters, were awesome as well. Mugen, your rough but\
          \
        free spirited type. Jin, the always serious but has a compassionate side. And Fuu, the clumsy but yet spicy female. Although one may consider these to be ''cliche'' what was different was that they all had a past that was hidden until throughout the anime. I loved being able to go onto every other episode and unleash fragments of their past. Not to mention, their personalities coming together was always fun to watch. I was entertained within every episode, which is rare for me because I'm sorta picky when it comes to giving anime's a full 10.\
THE SOUNDTRACKS MY GOODNESS, I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE. Every soundtrack was absolutely, BEAUTIFUL. Now when I say beautiful, I don't mean...orchestral beautiful. But to incorporate hip-hop with Samurai sword fights and beautiful voices such as Minm's is genius. I loved hearing every soundtrack in the background and the amazing opening and endings! Usually I only end up like either the opening or the ending, so if you're like me to be able to enjoy both is sorta rare. \
Overall, I recommend this to just about anyone! It's a fun anime, and I wish I never finished as quick as I did...but it was just that good that I couldn't help myself to finish it! Thanks so much Hosoda Mamoru. (: \

    Cowboy Bepop overhangs any critical appraisal of Samurai Champloo. Notwithstanding the shadow cast over all subsequent anime by Cowboy Bebop in general, the very fact that Samurari Champloo was also directed by Shinichirō Watanabe tends to betoken a parallel a critique of the two. Indeed, this comparison is not exactly void, for there are a number of motifs that conjoin the two shows together, and render their functionality and (where appropriate) overall message as almost indistinguishable.  \
Cowboy Bebop fuses the disparate thematic strands of jazz, the space age, country westerns, and martial arts into a disconcertingly plausible universe that challenges our assumptions about the\
          \
        black-and-white categories we use to fix certain types of experience into carefully demarcated compartments - be they fictional, musical, or artistic. On the whole, however, I would contend that Cowboy Bebop is a decidedly non-didactic show, and succeeds through its masterful directing, scripting, and soundtrack as opposed to its capacity to push a coherent idea or agenda, and either reform or revolutionize the viewer’s conceptions about the world around them.\
It seems unfortunate to me, then, that Samurai Champloo lags every-so-slightly behind its predecessor on all three of these accounts - directing, scripting, and musical score. Whilst certainly flourishing in these areas (if not to the virtually inimitable standards set by Cowboy Bebop) it is not alone sustained by them; and yet I would accord it the same rating as Cowboy Bebop. This is because Samurai Champloo manages to, ironically, succeed where Cowboy Bebop merely sufficed - in promoting a narrative, idea, or agenda that proves to be both thought-provoking and paradigm challenging. The fusion of Edo-era Japan, samurai culture, hip-hop, and urban lifestyle is more jarring and chasm-surmounting than the combination of themes, styles, and motifs in Cowboy Bebop. It is not simply showing us that things don’t have to be kept in their correct, pre-labelled spheres of experience, that hip-hop is not just urban and American whilst samurais are not just ancient and Japanese, but so riotously and seditiously laughing in the faces of conservatives and reactionaries everywhere.\
This conflict between modernity and tradition is perfectly captured in two of the central characters - Mugen, the rash, foul-mouthed ex-pirate (spoiler alert?), and Gene, the serene, traditionalist practitioner of Bushido - whose attitudes and belief-systems are at such odds with one another that it’s remarkable that they stay together for more than a couple of days, let alone the whole leg of the journey from Edo to Nagasaki. The universe of Samurai Champloo is also, perversely, at conflict with itself; the nationalistic and isolationist policies of the Tokugawa shogunate are continually transgressed upon and parodied by the inclusion of rebelliously modern themes, such as beat-boxing and graffiti. History is presented to us with a reassuring sense of accuracy, and then suddenly distorted as it metamorphoses into an eclectic tapestry of competing and complementary motifs drawn from both the modern and traditional world.\
There are innumerable instances of this, and it is difficult to restrain myself from mentioning all of them. Perhaps one of the most simple and salient occurs at the very beginning of the series, when Mugen and Gene first meet and engage in an impromptu sword battle that leaves no clear victor - Gene, well-studied in swordsmanship, remarks that he cannot understand why he is unable to defeat Mugen, because the latter is so undisciplined and technically unskilled. In other words, his very rigid conception of what is and is not good swordsmanship is thrown asunder by the definitively modern ethos of Mugen - who is so uncompromisingly individualistic that, when asked by a security guard (who is stationed at a checkpoint, an omnipresent feature of the Samurai Champloo universe, presumably to mock overly stringent migration controls) to step on a picture of the crucifix (another motif frequently poured into this already heady mix) to ascertain that he is not a Christian, he refuses to do so, preferring detainment or even death over having to submit to anyone else’s authority. \
At the very end of the series, a revered and masterful samurai tells Gene that “you were born in the wrong era, and so was I”, in reference to the relative stability and peace of the Edo era that saw samurais as increasingly irreverent. I couldn’t help but thinking that all of the characters in the show were born into the wrong era - from the homosexual Dutchman to the baseball fanatic villager - and that it is both to the benefit of society and the individual to welcome, tolerate, and even encourage a variety of differing cultures in order to reap the fruits of diversity. \
Then why, if this show is as profound as I’ve (somewhat disingenuously) detailed, does it only deserve an 8? Well, I must come clean, this show is not exactly a George Bernard Shaw play - it is, above all, good fun, a fairly enjoyable 26-episode romp replete with a juicy subtext for pseudo-intellectuals to hinge onto so they can convince themselves that anime is as artistically significant as any form of high culture. And whilst I mainly watch anime because of how irresistibly fun it is, it really needs to blow my socks off to roll into the hall of fame that is ascribed to 9s and 10s. Samurai Champloo occasionally limped into silliness, and rested its laurels on standard, cross-genre anime tropes that have long since ceased to entertain me; there is, at times, a slightly stale stench emanating from the improbable journey of Mugen, Gene, and Fuu, but the series is a classic all the same, and if you want to look more deeply into it, I’m sure you’ll unearth all sorts of wonders to ramble on about.\

    Ah man, Samurai Champloo. I remember reading about it a little while before I had watched Cowboy Bebop and getting confused (Wikipedia is not always your friend). After watching Bebop, I jumped on it. Hard.\
The premise is simple, it's a largely episodic series about three youngsters travelling together in samurai era Japan to find one of those samurai. Only one of them, Fuu, wants to find him, while the other two, Jin and Mugen, are indebted to her but really just want to fight to see who's the tougher bastard. Like Bebop, they're usually scrounging for their next meal, and they always find a way\
          \
        to get into trouble - running into a hidden Christian community with a crooked preacher, being hunted down by another swordsman, getting caught up in a gang war and illegal gambling ring, the list goes on. Each episode is quite unique, so you don't have to worry about things getting boring. The time period is interesting and really beautiful to see explored, with a few modern twists thrown in for a great style.\
Without a doubt, the first thing to point out about this show is the animation value. It's superb. The fight scenes are a treat to watch, as well as all of the character design and background art. Visually, this show is a feast.\
What really keeps the show together is it's soundtrack, which is almost to the same incredibly high standard as Cowboy Bebop's was, this time using experimental hip hop. I wasn't a hip hop fan going into this, I thought it was a dull genre of music that just wasn't for me, but I don't even leave the house without Nujabes on my phone now. Just name an emotion and there's a track on here that'll make you feel it, and feel it hard.\
The story itself is good, however it's the characters that keep it fresh and interesting. Jin is reserved and moral, Mugen is outlandish and a thug, while Fuu is the naive one who keeps the group together. Initially, they can barely stand each other, but as the story progresses, you really get to see them bond and develop, becoming large parts of one another's lives. But don't think they're humble enough to admit it. I'll admit, there are two pretty lame filler episodes right before the final arc, but they're so eclipsed by the ending that they're quite easy to overlook and forget about. What really wraps this up in a neat little bow is the talent of the english dub, each character sounds exactly like you'd expect them to.\
Great animation, great sound, great vocals, wonderful and memorable characters, if this isn't ticking off any boxes on your list there's something wrong with you. If you haven't seen Samurai Champloo, you've missed out on probably the strongest show from 2004. This isn't another Bebop, but it really tries to make itself rather than riding on coat tails. Just remember, you're on that journey with them, and the destination really isn't that important, what matters is what you do getting there.\

    --Story: 9--\
The story of a girl searching for \"A samurai who smells of sunflowers\" sounds terribly simple. Which is fair, that's what it is. But considering what the series aims to give, it's quite suitable. So instead I've based the 'story' on the average rating I'd give each episodes story line. Samurai Champloo often has a different plot/story for each episode, the story spanning over 2 episodes max. Though this may not be suitable for someone interested in a story intense anime, it allows the creators to fill it with much action, humour, and entertainment. Even with the somewhat cliche stories used, they were done\
          \
        in such a way that I was completely drawn in each time\
--Art: 10--\
I absolutely loved the art and animation. The character designs were unique (while still making them fit in with the era). I personally found the art style one of the best I've seen. As were the designs, it was unique, and expressive, but still very much anime. The animation as well was brilliant, the fight scenes were smoothly animated, and the simpler scenes were done just as well. Easily a 10.\
--Sound: 9--\
I'm not a big fan of hip hop, so my opinion here may be a little bias, or I'd have thought so. Even with a strange music choice, it seems to blend in with the mood of the series perfectly. It just depends if you like it. \
--Character: 9--\
At first glance the characters seem overused, and basic. Fuu, a young cheerful girl who often gets herself kidnapped. Jin, a very traditional and silent samurai. And Mugen, Jin's completer opposite, a self taught fighter who acts before he thinks and seems to have no concern for those around him (unless it's a beautiful woman). And in a way, I suppose that's exactly what they are. But they're perfectly suited for the mood the series wishes, and succeeds to portray. Not only that, but I felt all three characters did have their own little quirks which separate them from the typical characters they seem to mimic. \
--Enjoyment: 10--\
I was especially fond of the mixture of moods through Samurai Champloo, some episodes are quite melancholy, tragic even. Usually the longer stories. While others are, to simply put it, strange. The humour in the series meant it could be enjoyed in more than one way.\
--Overall: 9--\
At first glance Samurai Champloo seems full of cliche's, with a pretty basic setup. But this series isn't about intense story or character development, it's about action and entertainment. And on that level, I feel it succeeded, or even surpassed what I had hoped for. \

    I first watched some of Samurai Champloo as a child through the dub (I do not recommend, as in go for the subs instead). Of course it was when I was in very early middle school and that wasn't a good thing, but the good side of that is that I found it \"boring.\" Anyway, fast-forward to around 2012, I decided to try finishing Samurai Champloo. Of course, I really did finish, and I ended up feeling empty inside. Why? I felt like I lost three good friends, and gosh... it was a melancholic feeling and I still remember it from time to time.\
Story: The\
          \
        plot of this series is just amazing because it is not your typical samurai anime- it just isn't. It is an anime with an actual noticeable, yet small amount of slice of life included. There are moral questions that show up all the time. A realistic-like adventure (that also has goofiness) with three colorful friends. Our topic, Samurai Champloo, follows Fuu, a 15 year old girl who lost her mother. Yes that sounds very overused, but this isn't done shallowly at all in this show, and I kid you not. It's heartbreaking when you find out what lead to her death when you think about it. Anyway, Fuu was working at her relatives' shop, when Mugen shows up. Mugen, being one who likes fighting opponents stronger than him, instantly wanted to kill Jin, another one of our trio, when he appeared at the shop. This all happened because of an egocentric father-son duo.\
Champloo is an action show, with the large element of traveling through Japan, which is based on a fictionalized and real mix of the Edo era with other elements mixed in. The most central point of the story which is the goal of Fuu our heroine, is to find the \"sunflower samurai,\" who she doesn't where to find. Mugen and Jin, being in her debt, had to promise and accompany her, and find this samurai.\
Now, keep in mind, as amazing as this anime is, it's a mature rated anime as I mentioned earlier. How so? I was 18 when I watched this, and I found the element of brothels and prostitutes, included with the fact that Mugen is a womanizer, and Jin who would accompany him to red districts difficult for me to watch at times. However, it's not anything so explicit that it takes away from the show. So if you're not one comfortable with these kinds of things or you're a preteen, maybe you shouldn't pick this up. HOWEVER, that is up to you. If anything I highly recommend to watch this show years later if you're not around 18 or so. Now if this was an anime where brothels were centuries out of use, and this sort of thing was going on, I'd be saying really different things. Anyway, onto the art we go.\
Art: The art of Champloo is somewhat inconsistent. At times it'll look really smooth, other times, it'll seem like an early 90's anime quality, gritty lines, pretty low quality. It ranges from great art, to below average. However, overall the art is still quite good. The animation is well-done, fight scenes are great, and movements quick and smooth. When the animators did so, some scenes are very dramatic and suspenseful, the colors being perfect for a scene. The effects used are also done very well, and they're definitely not plain; big props to good effects that aren't overkill or boring. Regardless of a few downgrades near the first episodes, the art still passes well.\
Sound: Samurai Champloo's sound is one of the most noteworthy. You only have to start this anime once and you'll find multiple very memorable tracks. This mostly refers to the bgm courtesy of Nujabes, Tsutchie, Force of Nature, and many more artists. A WIDE variety of composers and singers took part in the soundtrack, and that is no joke. MINMI, who did an excellent job on two endings, Kazami for a great English ending, Midicronica for another notable ending, and there are even Japanese folk songs that have an important part in the show. The music is amazing, and sets the mood for Champloo just so well. The songs can be moving, relaxing, or ominous. The sound for this series is leveled with its story. To add, the voice acting for this series is very spot-on. Our main cast's voices match so well with our characters, you'd think that they're the same person or something of the like. All in all, superb sound for this series.\
Character: Beware of some spoilers here! Here, the character descriptions get longer and longer as the farther you get, the more I talk about character relations with one another.\
The three main characters, Fuu, Mugen, and Jin.\
Fuu, the petite 15 year old with a monstrous appetite, who is cheery and a hard worker when she needs to be. She can be lazy, a liar, many things and isn't exactly very womanly, but she's feminine, has a good sense of justice, and is very determined to reach her goal. In truth,  she is actually very considerate. Regardless of what most characters see of her, there are many deeper sides to her, and she has had a tragic past, even if that doesn't show up all the time. An adorable, seemingly upbeat girl, who is a pretty strong female lead.\
Mugen is the crude, fighting-obsessed, lazy, violent, women-chasing, in your face dishonest one of the trio. He's rough, on the mean side, and seems completely selfish. Below the surface, he has some loyalty, and does care about his friends, as much as they would doubt that. Regardless of his many negative and infamous traits, he develops friendship with the other two. He grows attached to them, and cares for them, something he would never admit. There's a good amount of character growth that he went through in the series. Like Fuu, he also had a tragic past, leading to how he is who he is today. Mugen does not get along with Fuu, who he calls flat-chested, fat, and other things. Fuu finds him lazy, crude, and untrustworthy. Through time, they learn to worry about one another, and share a bond.\
Jin is the silent, seemingly typical \"good-looking\" glasses one. He's very quiet and reserved. A very skilled samurai on Mugen's level, but they're complete opposites personality-wise. Jin has a sense of morals, and fights because he learned, and does it through prediction and sheer speed. Mugen would fight him with impulsive moves, kicks, and even some break-dancing. Jin and Mugen do NOT get along in the beginning. What's Fuu to do when her two bodyguards are total opposites? It's more than enough when they fight antagonists, only to say they're alive because they want to kill each other. Yet, these two opposites become friends. Respecting each other, believing each other, and relating to one another. Of course, they would never admit that. Jin follows the others with a tragic past as well, one that pretty much haunts him throughout most of their journey. Because of his quiet trait, the talkative Fuu can't really interact with him at first. Later on, they both get to know each other better, and so Fuu would become sad at a certain part of our story, when Jin abruptly says that he may leave the trio.\
These three strangers, who have many conflicts in their travels, become the best of friends. A lot of things happen, a lot of things change. Things come up, things are overcome, and some are never gotten over. In the end, there is a very strong friendship between these three, even if they leave each other.\
Enjoyment: As you can probably see, I very much enjoyed this show. I didn't expect to love it like I do today, but I do. It was a very wonderful adventure with our lovable trio, and it saddens me that we couldn't continue on it.\
Overall, Samurai Champloo gets a high 9 for me. I hope you enjoyed this review and thank you for reading!\

    Samurai champloo is a rare anime. Anime infused with hip hop. It was a awesome mix. This anime banged. It's flipping great. The music and sound is perfect. The beautiful soundtracks on this anime give the most wonderful experience whilst watching samurais fulfill their duties.\
Action 8/10: The action is good stuff. It's lightning quick. You see the swing the sword and the next second bang someone just got cut the hell up and there you go, people getting murdered in quick intervals. The swordplay is unique. You won't come across everyday anime where people swing there swords in a fast brutal fashion with murderous intent.\
          \
        The action is very fast paced. The action sometimes gory other times not really but that's not a bother at all.\
Story 8/10: It's generic but somewhat emotional. The story is about a girl who meets a character name mugen who is the gangster, thuggish type of samurai who saves her from getting her fingers cut off. Jin who seems like a respectable fighter battles with mugen and both are arrested. The girl named Fuu helps them escape from their execution and then they make a deal that both samurais will accompany her to find her father. During the way many battles and situations occur. Great character development and relationship building occurs throughout the anime. As it progresses the emotions, personalities and what drives each individual character becomes more clear and vivid. The story is enticing. So simple yet so addictive. You'll love it\
Overall 8/10: Samurai champloo is a masterpiece samurai anime. It's a classic I've watched  a couple of times. One thing that makes it stand out from other sword animes is the music. The music bangs. It's really unique.\

    **This review does NOT contain any spoilers**\
Samurai Champloo sets itself apart from anime that many viewers have become accustomed to. With that being said, it is an excellent and highly recommended anime to all, but I think seasoned anime enthusiasts will enjoy it a bit more than people still relatively new to anime. Samurai Champloo opened my eyes to the excitement and appreciation of creative content that sets itself apart from overused elements often times seen in anime. The music and art style is very original and most importantly works fantastically with the series.\
The subject material of the anime is very adult, so I wouldn't\
          \
        recommend this to young children. Of course everyone has a different level of maturity, so I don't see a need for a definite age cap but it is definitely suited for a mature audience. \
I rate this anime a 10/10 due to the content of the story. First of all, with the dialogue being as adult as it is, it was very easy to envelope oneself into the story. The situations that were being portrayed where very realistic, along with the character responses. Samurai Champloo shows both the good and bad in the world that we all live in. \
This is also the first time I have ever watched an anime without favoring a specific main character, the main characters have such a fantastic chemistry that I often found myself favoring certain responses of certain characters in certain situations but definitely understanding and being okay with all responses in all of the situations.\
In conclusion, without a doubt give this anime a shot. The entertainment value is unrivaled and it might give you a new lens to view the world through.  \

    After Cowboy Bebop, I had soft corner for Episodic anime. And after learning that Champloo was made by the same guy who did CB, I planned to get myself watching this. \
Story: Historic samurai style story blended with various cultural aspects, struggles, sexuality, freedom and how the people longing the desire to have something which we have easily. It might be concluded as simple as \"Girl trying to find samurai who smells of sunflower\", but it is much better than that. It is just the dot for the story and the journey is what the real story is.\
It was Edo period, and people already\
          \
        fed up with their life, culture that is holding them back. All they want is been depicted along the episodes. It is not like if you miss a episode, you will miss a part of story. The story builds up exactly towards the end. But nonetheless, story is unique, creative and practical. I did enjoyed it thoroughly. \
Character: The show is enjoyable with the entertainment from the characters. Be it Fuu, Jin, Mugen or any other characters. The back-stories are well insulated from one another, and revealed over the course of story progression. It seems like all characters are well planned, connected and placed just where they need to be. The character development is just amazing. On one hand you have Mugen, who uses force to solve everything, and on other, Jin, who is calm and wary samurai. And then Fuuu. They are not your ordinary Japanese characters as you might have seen in other anime. If it wasn't for clever,witty,humorous characters, Champloo wouldn't be in this place.\
Art: It was different. It kinda resembled CB but the different setting and atmosphere made it look different. It was great fun to watch the beautiful scenaries, witty and quirky characters and their emotions. Art style executed well considering the time period of the setting. Integrating modern elements with ninja era worked out well.\
Music/Voice Acting: This is next big thing after Characters! Tracks are matching the vibe, adding to humorous characters appeal. If CB and Jazz is the best, Champloo and HH is the King. I can never enjoy the show for it's music as much as SC, and man! those beats and tracks are just made for this. \
Next big mention is english voice acting. Guys always prefer sub over dub, but this, I don't think sub will ever match the dub. VA understand, reflect the pain and feelings. Cast is perfect. Using modern slang for samurai era sounds stupid, but no. It is the REAL fun of this show. And dialogues need big mention. It was deep, funny, cynical, dark and a mixed bag of emotions. It is well written, well executed by VAs and it is pleasure to listen to the wisdom.\
Action: I never thought SC can hold action in it's core. But to my surprise action has been seen throughout the story. It was because of action, I took time to watch this. And eventhough it is mix of many things, action takes importance. It is not your regular hack & slash ninja action. It is your un-expected, ugly fights mixed with well executed samurai sword fights. Action is perfect, art style complements the action. Sound is just cherry on top of already good action. \
Overall: Hell yeah! I enjoyed it and I happily recommend this to anyone. It has values, lessons, humor and action which makes it perfect anime for everyone. If you want action, see this. if you want drama/feelings, watch this. If you want best OST, see this. If you want good story, see this. If you want subtle humor, see this, It has everything one can ask for.\

    Samurai Champloo doesn't take itself too seriously, and is packed with the kind of action you'd expect out of a show about ancient Japan. Lots of satisfying fights, and moments that will genuinely make you laugh. The main characters, who are all polar opposites of each other, are the centerpiece of the show with their genuine and often hilarious interactions. But as much as I enjoyed seeing them on their journey, I have to say that it wasn't enough to carry the show into 9 or 10 range. The ending of the show left a bad taste in my mouth, as if the creators struggled\
          \
        to close the series and went with some sort of \"safe\" ending that left nobody satisfied.\
*spoilers\
The main plot, if you would call it that, had Fuu searching for the \"samurai that smells like sunflowers.\" I was expecting some sort of badass reason for her making the search the focal point of her life, but in the end we find out that it's her dad and she wants to punch him for leaving mom. Hey, I like shows that show how stupid and petty life can be sometimes, but the fact that it was \"marketed\" to the viewer throughout the show as something more epic left me with an intense sense of disappointment by the end. \
Until the last few episodes to the ending credits, I was waiting for some sort of big reveal that would make the entirety of the journey feel less pointless and was sorely disappointed. It also disappointment me to see a number of side-plots and loose ends that were forgotten/ignored in the epilogue. A budding relationship between Jin and Fuu is simply cut off, and the subtle moments of tension are ultimately wasted for unsatisfying reasons. Shows like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood were masterful in the way they closed up all the loose ends by the final episode, making the ending truly satisfying. Samurai Champloo had an opportunity to do something similar, but fumbled.\
And that's not mentioning the hilarious amount of plot armor at the end of Champloo, where both characters survive lethal stabbings/gunshot wounds and look better than ever as they walk off into the sunset at the closing credits. While I know that the show isn't supposed to be taken seriously, it bothered me that the final fights weren't won by cunning or willpower but rather by the ability to survive fatal wounds and magically heal limbs that were broken a few scenes earlier.\
The show has strong similarities to Cowboy Bebop, but doesn't have the same level of refinement to it. The dialogue doesn't have the same philosophic edge to it, or realism. Mugen & Jin & Fuu are just not as good as Spike & Jet & Faye.\
While I did focus a lot on the flaws of this show in the review, I'm not saying it was bad - anything but. You WILL enjoy Samurai Champloo if you like anime in general.\

    My experience in anime revolves mostly around fighting animes, and with that point in mind ill start off by saying that it's one of the best fighting animes I've ever seen. Let's break it down:\
Story: Rather than being one continuous arc, the series is broken down in small adventures that usually start and end withing the frame of one episode.While some may complain that it's hard to keep track of what has happened in past episodes, I think that for an anime less concerned with feelings and more with fighting, it's an excellent configuration.It also fits well the theme of the anime which, instead of\
          \
        being the heroes' self-improvement and conquests is rather a take on subtle aspects and issues of japanese culture and history, such as Bushido, Baseball, corruption, sexism, honor, The West, and Yakuza. AND FIGHTING!!!!!!! The developpers also threw a  recap episode in there.       9/10 \
Art: Stunning. Absolutely marvelous fighting sequences. I had to wait 120 episodes of Naruto to come slightly close the the fluidity and choreography of the fighting sequences in this anime. The drawing style is also unconventional, rending the ugly uglier and the beautiful more so when necessary, making certain moments look like something you could frame. Excellent. 10/10\
Sound: Since the anime is somewhat meta, instead of trying to look serious with hardcore samurai music, it mostly relies on jazz, hip-hop and chill-out music, making it elegant. Also, once, it used beatboxing as backround music. You gotta like that. ;)  9/10\
Character: The characters are well defined and have very clear personalities.\
The heroes' backround stories are rather frustratingly vague, but if they had more it would've weighed the anime down and detracted from it's intention. 8/10\
Enjoyment: I very much enjoyed this anime. It made me laugh, it brought tears to my eyes and it made me stare in awe at the awesomeness of the fighting scenes. It did exactly what it had in mind to do: To make the spectator enjoy it and to plant a pleasant memory in his mind. 10/10\
Overall, this anime is awesome. It will satisfy your thirst for fighting in a very elegant and pleasant way, making you sad once it's over. Watch it. Trust me. 10/10\

    Besides Mushishi, this is anime is GOOD!!!\
When I first saw it on the net, I dont really care... but then, I gave it a try and it was awesome!\
The story was interesting. Mugen, Fuu and Jin was awesome. Unlike any samurai battles, like Bleach (no offense), this anime has a different fighting style and you can see them swinging their sword as fast as a bullet!!! Mugen also uses some hip-hop kicks and evades attacks, attacks with a sword. Jin shows Bushido with his katana. \
The art was also good. Stylish yet fascinating. The best of all is the OST!!!\
The opening 'Battlecry' is just nice!!!\

    Story: 8, Samurai Champloo's story is incredibly basic, almost cliche but with an edge. Two samurai and a girl bump into each other and end up travelling a journey in search of a man whom the girl is looking for. I've simplified it into one sentence, there's not much to say to the plot other than that. Very simple, which isn't a bad thing. Each episode (with a few exceptions) entails its own unique mini-plot. One after another the mini-stories reveal new clues to the main story while at the same time building background behind each of the three main characters. \
Art: 8, Just go\
          \
        watch 10 seconds of an episode and you'll see if you like the artwork or not. Initially I didn't, 6months later I picked up Samurai Champloo again and it grew on me. I don't have to write about the artwork to get a reader to decide if he/she likes it or not. I'm sounding like some prissy priss\
Sound: 10, Amazing sound, probably one of my favorite anime sound-wise. Voice acting is spot-on with the character portrayal. The OST is very high quality, not much else to say; trying to justify how good the sound is is like trying to describe how good the art is. It's severely subjective. \
Character: 10, 3 main characters, the complex between the trio is synonymous of Naruto's Team 7 \"Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura\". \
Jin: Calm, collected, quiet, the pure definition of the textbook samurai. Jin represents order and logic, calmness and composure. A gentleman in the least. He is the mystery man, the James Bond of samurai. \
Mugen: Where Jin is yin, Mugen is yang. Mugen is essentially Jin's dichotomous counter-part. If you have ever studied Freud, Mugen would be the Id. Acting out on instinct, Mugen never fails to entertain. \
Fuu: Surprisingly, there is no love-interest between the three in competition with Fuu. Fuu sets the stage as the mediator between Jin and Mugen, she is the balance between the two extremes; thus she represents the ego. \
Enjoyment: 9, VERY funny, the comedy is never dry in Samurai Champloo, nor is the action. This is pretty subjective and I can't really relate it to any other anime. What I found very well done was the connection between the samurai era and today's age. Hip-hop culture serves as the connection through music, graffiti, free-style rapping. I'm not much of a hip-hop fan but I can't stop but laugh when I see a samurai in the 1800s trying to rap with a guy beat-boxing in the background. \
Overall: 9, Samurai Champloo is well worth the watch, I'd say the anime lacks in story depth and consistency but that's not saying much as it excels in every other area. Go watch it!\

    Story: \
Two samurai Jin and Mugen were sent to prison and where saved by a restaurant waitress Fuu on the condition that they'll help her look for the 'Samurai who Smeills like Sunflowers' and so begins their great (or not so great XD) adventure. In my opinion, the series is just a buch of stand alone episodes about the trio getting into all sorts of mishaps. But it's not that bad. in fact, it's great! XD\
one thing that's bugging me about the series is that it's like a history show gone wrong as there are events that could NOT have happened! \
\
Art: \
If you've seen\
          \
        Cowboy Bebop, then you'll porbably be familiar with the art work. The characters looks skinny or lean. There's also a few characters who might look a bit alike with Cowboy Bebop charas. Mugen for one looks like Spike from Bebop but with a rowdy attitude. The animation is great, the characters have a fluid movement, especially when they fight.\
Sound: \
The series STRONGEST POINT for me.  Hip-hop tunes on a samurai anime, now there's something you don't see everyday. a mix of new and old...well it doesn't really go well with the samurai theme BUT it matches the characters wacky antics as well as the fights. Heck even the Opening Theme is a Rap song...a good one at that! XD\
\
Character:\
Well, the characters are pretty much unique. Mugen is a samurai who breakdances as he fights. no, his fighting style IS break dancing. Not Copoera, break dancing with sword slashes. now how cool is that. Jin specializes in the traditional samurai arts and Fuu is not much of a fighter but comes from a samurai family. \
Personality-wise, Mugen is loud, short-tempered, and dresses way different from a usual Japanese of that era. His style is hip-hop. \
Jin, is quiet, wears glasses, and is pretty much your everyday samurai ala Kenshin Himura.\
Fuu is a former waitress who was born from a samurai clan.\
THese are the first impression you'll get from them, but as the series progresses you'll get to see different sides of the characters.\
Overall:\
A not so typical samurai anime that's sure to head you hyped up and your head babging to the hip-hop beat. \

    Samurai Champloo is a really unique show with a lot of potential to be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, I think it falls short of what it could have been because of creative ideas that are never really executed all the way. I still enjoyed this show a lot though, and I would recommend it. \
Story (C+) - Well, the story in Samurai Champloo is pretty basic. Fuu wants the find the sunflower samurai, so she gets Mugen and Jin to be her bodyguards on her journey. On the way they meet people, get stuck in dangerous situations, and bond with eachother. This is nothing new, but\
          \
        to me it's an interesting concept for a story that never gets old. So I was expecting Fuu, Mugen, and Jin to get involved in some hilarous adventures while learning to appreciate eachother, but soon I realized that the show's format is somewhat episodic. Although the main story (finding the samurai who smells of sunflowers) is always there, there are several episodes that have nothing to do with what's going on. This would have been okay if these episodes actually were entertaining. A lot of episodes really didn't work for me, and I found myself thinking \"what was the point of that?\" \"Can they get back to story.\" \"This episode is a waste...\" and things like that. Of course there are entertaining and funny episodes and those ones make up for the ones that are pointless. This show is a lot like Cowboy Bebop (although I like Samurai Champloo a lot better than CB) because sooo many episodes are wasted on stuff I don't care about when they could have used an episode to develop a character more or add some emotional depth. Later in the series there are some pretty emotionally deep episodes. Those are the ones that actually made this show better than average. \
Art (A-) - The animation style is nice to look at. The fight scenes look great, and all the characters look pretty distinct. Sometimes the animation can look a little rushed and not very detailed, but most of scenes are drawn really beautifully, so this isn't a big problem. I was surprised at how smooth the fight scenes were though. It was impressive to look at. At times this show almost reminds me of a watercolor painting because it's so flowy. Overall, I liked the animation a lot. \
Sound (A+) - Like Shinichiro Watanabe's other work, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo is known for its integration of music that wouldn't usually fit the genre. Even though the story is in a samurai setting, modern hip-hop and rap based music is used throughout the whole show. This is definitely one of the strong points of Samurai Champloo. The way that the music is integrated is really funny and surprisingly effective. The OP and ED are really good in my opinion, and the music makes the show even more unique. Even if you aren't a fan of hip-hop, the music is still very enjoyable. All of the voice actors do a really good job with their characters, especially Mugen. \
Character (B+) - The characters in Samurai Champloo are some of the most memorable characters out there. Mugen is obviously based on the modern thug or gangster type. His fighting style uses moves from breakdancing which I thought was really cool. He's definitely the craziest out of the group and he has the shortest temper. At times he can be a jerk, and he kind of got on my nerves but I still liked him. Jin is the exact opposite of Mugen. He's stoic, emotionless, and his facial expression never changes. He's really quiet (unlike Mugen who yells all the time) and his fighting style is much more traditional. He also got on my nerves because he was too boring, but again, I still liked him. Mugen and Jin complement eachother really well because they're so different from eachother. I like the contrast between the two, but this is a part of the show that actually annoyed me. Mugen and Jin are really extreme. There's no middle ground in their personalities. Mugen is always crazy and Jin is always boring. After awhile I was hoping for some character growth, but that never really happened. Fuu on the other hand is the most normal of the group. Throughout the show it actually does seem like she grows up. She can be whiny sometimes but I identified with her the most (maybe because I'm a girl) and I found myself agreeing with her a lot. Although Fuu can be a little stubborn and naive at times, she has the most emotional depth out of all the characters, and her search for the sunflower samurai is really the driving force of the show. All other characters in the show are there for only one or two episodes and never seen again. This was kind of frustrating because so many characters would be introduced but none of them were really developed. The three main protagonists are funny and entertaining. I liked them a lot even though they could be irritating at times. \
Enjoyment (B-) - Samurai Champloo is an enjoyable show...if you're willing to go all the way. I have to admit, in the first few episodes I started to wonder when the story was going to turn into something. Some episodes just felt too fillerish, and like I said before a lot of them were trying to be humorous but ended up just being stupid. The last few episodes of the show are surprisingly intense as opposed to the laid back approach of several other episodes, and by the end I wished that the show was longer. The episodes are pretty much hit or miss. The bad ones are forgettable, but the good ones are so good that it makes you want to keep watching. There's also a recap episode in the middle that started out pretty good but it ended so stupidly that I couldn't believe I even wasted my time watching it.The story and character development are another issue. Whenever they started to go into the pasts of the characters, or develop them in any way, the episode would end and then a new episode would start that had nothing to do with anything that just happened. That was really frustrating for me. By the end of the show I was sad because I wanted to know more about the characters and what was going to happen to them. After 26 episodes I expected to have more character development. I also didn't understand why Mugen and Jin were so mean to Fuu sometimes. In the beginning I was like \"ok...well I probably wouldn't like her that much either right now.\" But by the end I was like \"Why are they still treating her like that?\" Fuu showed her affection for Mugen and Jin several times, but they never really show any for her. I was hoping for them to acknowledge her as a friend, but that never really happened. I thought there would atleast be a group hug or something. Mugen and Jin never really had a deep conversation either though. There were a lot of times when I would think \"Do they even like eachother?\" I was fine with Mugen, Jin, and Fuu bickering like siblings because it was entertaing to a certain extent, but the other side of their relationship wasn't explored enough. Stuff like this really took the enjoyment level down a little bit. Some people probably say the weird relationships between the characters and the disjointed story are what make Samurai Champloo unique. I guess that's true, but I was still somewhat dissapointed. The last episode was bittersweet. I liked it, but I'm not gonna lie - I was dissapointed with how they ended it. \
Overall (B) - Even though I give this show an 8 it probably seems like I'm being a little harsh on it, but the only reason I have so many problems with it is because I think it could have been sooo much more epic. It sucks when a show that has so much potential doesn't take advantage of it. That's the main reason why I was dissapointed with a lot of the choices that were made in the show. Despite all of this, I enjoyed it a lot because of its uniqueness and the fact that with so many flaws I was still sad that it was over. An 8 isn't a bad score by any means, but Samurai Champloo could have easily made a 10 if it weren't for the annoying things that took it down a notch. But I definitely say it's worth watching and it's one of the better shows out there.",

    This is a shōnen anime series consisting of twenty-six episodes. Samurai Champloo was created and directed by Shinichirō Watanabe, whose previous television show, Cowboy Bebop, earned him renown in the anime and Japanese television. Champloo comes from the word Chanpuru which means mix or mashup so the title means Samurai Remix. The series in Watanabe's normal preference, is a cross-genre work of media, blending the action and samurai genres with elements of non-slapstick comedy. It is also a period piece, taking place during Japan's Edo period. The series is interwoven with revisionist historical facts and anachronistic elements of mise-en-scene, dialogue and soundtrack. The shows most\
          \
        frequent anachronism is its use of elements of hip hop culture, particularly rap and the music it has influenced, break dancing, turntablism, hip hop slang, and graffiti. The show also contains anachronistic elements from the punk subculture and modernism, but less prominently.\

    **Spoiler free review**\
When I started writing this review for Samurai Champloo I thought what is the first word that comes to my mind? It's \"unique\".\
As a history enthusiast I got sucked in by the Edo-era Japan setting and the idea of following a story of a ronin, criminal and a girl roaming around in search of this mysterious samurai. \
And then there is this other thing I wasn't aware of. This series takes place in an alternate history.\
Oh man was I surprised when I first saw how seamlessly they've combined Edo period and hip-hop culture. It flows so good most of the time, that you\
          \
        don't even realize those hip-hop culture homages just because how great they execute them.\
Another thing I liked about this anime, is that even though most of the episodes were \"case of the day\" It still connected big plot points and had very good character progression. Since this is spoiler free review I'm not going to details but a good bunch of the episodes had some great metaphors and critique of different topics for example the very bizarre episode 22.\
Art in this anime was great most of the time, but you could see from far which episodes were made to spare the budget. Music in this anime is no less than god-tier as you could expect It's a mix of Classic japanese music and hip-hop, I thoroughly enjoyed it. \
\"I think I've found what I was looking for all this time. I, who was always alone... found comrades for the first time.\"\
Overall score: 9\

    Our lives can get pretty busy these days.  With all of our activities, academic studies, and work going along, sometimes an intense anime that keeps you on your toes and forces you to binge watch due to its addictive nature might not the best choice for a healthy balance in life.  Samurai Champloo could be what you might be looking for.  In a nutshell, this anime is very relaxing for the most part with amazing music and epic fight scenes for raw, pleasant entertainment.\
Story (8/10):\
Although this sounds like an excuse, Samurai Champloo does not need a deeply enthralling plot of epic proportions\
          \
        to be good.  Samurai Champloo is episodic.  This means that each episode or two will have a subplot with a major goal on the side for the entire anime.  Most of the subplots are fair enough.  The shenanigans of Jin and Mugen, two main male characters, are very fun.  The plot, overall, is simple and straightforward.  2 samurais and a random girl go on a journey to find a samurai that smells of sunflowers.  What I enjoy of the story is the era in which it takes place.  There are a few samurai, here and there, but in Samurai Champloo, their time is coming to a close.  Conflicts are sometimes different from the straightforward samurai approach to things.  When people want power, they will not just kill people, they will keep them alive and exploit them instead.  Being thrust in the middle of these two things, this new era and tradition, is a major foundation for Samurai Champloo.\
Art (8/10): \
Honestly, I don't know how to grade older art.  Samurai Champloo certainly looks solid, but compared to the newer, more colourful art styles I've seen before , the visuals are hard to rate.  In general, Samurai Champloo is less colourful than other animes.  It is more grounded and persay, a more realistic style?  What is amazing about the art is the fight scenes.  The directors know how to make good action scenes.  Samurai Champloo has some amazing fight choreography with how fast, energetic and crazy Mugen slashes and how precise Jin strikes.  These moments are engaging and hard to look away from.  If you want swift katana fights with plenty of noob (random people who are a lot weaker than main characters) stomping, Samurai Champloo should fit the bill just right.  The fights are definitely some of the high points of this anime.\
Sound (10/10):\
This has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.  Background songs are chill af and have this hip-hop vibe that is addictive as eating a whole bag of Lays chips on a Monday afternoon.  The music heavily complements how the anime feels and plays out to the viewer.  It heavily relieves tension and is great for not just watching the anime, but outside standalone as well.  The soundtrack is great for studying and background music in your own life!  However, in order to truly appreciate the soundtrack, you have to fill your own memories with this anime, so that every track receives additional significance from its original prupose.  Other than the OST, the OP, I would say, is different?  I mean it is rap, which is incredibly unique for an anime opening.  Although the song is a bit prickly at first, it should warm up on you in time.  The ED is great.  It sounds and feels like a true classic.\
Characters (8/10):\
What I like about Samurai Champloo is the lack of tropes in an anime.  I have watched a decent amount of anime where you kinda expect stupid events to happen such as a girl randomly falling for the male protagonist, etc.  The characters in Samurai Champloo feature none of that and WILL have decently fleshed out backstories as they progress on their journey. The cast, in general, is very likeable, although I'm sure many will find Mugen as the favourite.  His fighting style and \"I don't care about anything\" attitude come off as charismatic.  I am also glad that the female lead, Fuu, is not annoying.  That's a relief!\
Enjoyment (9/10):\
The change in pace from heavily tense anime to something more relaxing is something I found incredibly enjoyable.  The comedy in this anime is crazy good and there is one episode near the end that made me laugh really hard.  Once you couple great comedy with awesome action, you have a great enjoyment factor in an anime.  \
Overall (9/10):\
It is hard to go wrong with Samurai Champloo.  From the art, the soundtrack, and the comedy, it is a very well-rounded anime.  There are few to none cons unless you care about deep plot, romance, deeper characters, or a more anime-esque colour palette for the art.  I found none of these aspects to be a big deal and found myself smiling at how chill Samurai Champloo can be.  Anime is a medium of entertainment and Samurai Champloo is just solid fun that you can enjoy at your own pace, on your lunch breaks, after a hard day at work, or a crazy university test.  It can be there waiting for you and ready to give you a smile.\

    Shinichiro Watanabe blew me away with Cowboy Bebop, a science fiction tale with a bit of jazz music and western influences thrown in. This time around, it's Samurai Champloo, a samurai tale set in the Edo period of Japan. Of course, it wouldn't be Watanabe without the odd amalgam of genres and tropes. Champloo, also known as Champuru, is an Okinawa word meaning \"blend\", though I think \"remix\" works better. This describes the series perfectly. Samurai and Japanese history is interesting enough, but it really intrigues when a hip-hop soundtrack and urban influence is thrown in to the mix.\
The plot isn't anything too fancy or\
          \
        layered. It focuses on Fuu and her search for the \"samurai who smells of sunflowers\" and her two \"bodyguards\", Mugen and Jin. This is just really a core plot to keep the group moving, the real fun comes with the many wild, crazy adventures they get themselves in while on the trip. The individual stories are so creative and interesting, things never get bored. One episodic could be a comedic romp focusing on the early years of baseball, or another could be a heartbreaking and violent tale of betrayal. Some of the episodes are weaker than others, and sometimes I wished the show was a bit more intelligent...but I digress. The show has it all; comedy, drama, and even more importantly, fun.\
Like Bebop, the show is episodic in nature, and the only real binding ties are the main characters. Each one is well developed and interesting, with intriguing pasts that are revealed bit by bit over the course of the series (once again, similar to Bebop). Though the characters by themselves are great, it's the fantastic interaction between them all that really shines. They all have completely different ways of thinking, so it's a great formula for character interaction.\
The studio behind this project is Manglobe, which I'm not very familiar with. That being said, they did an excellent job with the art and animation for this show. The action sequences are some of the most fluid and well-animated in the medium. They're top notch, and this series is around nine years old now. The urban look of the show complements the hip hop soundtrack and badass fight scenes. It's a nice departure from the usual standard samurai look that you see so often. \
The soundtrack is extraordinary. Who could have known hip hop would meld so perfectly with samurai? It works perfectly with the urban, stylized art style, and makes the series even more badass than it already is. The opening theme, in particular, is a wonderful piece of music. It's also worth mentioning that beatboxing and rapping also make appearances in the show from time to time, usually in a comedic nature. I'm not quite sure if the soundtrack is up to par to Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelt's work on Bebop, but it's pretty damn close.\
I know I've mentioned Bebop a lot throughout this review, but it really is unfair to dock this series because \"it's not as good as Bebop\". It's a great series in its own right. With beautiful animation, visceral action sequences, a memorable soundtrack, great dialogue, and interesting characters...Samurai Champloo earns a hearty recommendation.\
For reference, my favorite episodes are:\
5. Baseball Blues\
4. Gamblers and Gallantry\
3. Elegy of Entrapment (Verses 1 & 2)\
2. Misguided Miscreants (Verses 1 & 2)\
1. Evanescent Encounter (Verses 1, 2, & 3)\

    Before I started Samurai Champloo, I had no idea it would become one of my favorite animes.  I really did not realize what a treat I was in for.  I read about how it utilized hip hop into the soundtrack, but I didn't realize how great it would be incorporated.  One of the greatest things about the anime is the soundtrack.  The story always kept me interested, always striving to watch the next episode.  I think the length was perfect and I am happy to know that as far as now, there isn't any plan to make any more. \
          \
        The characters build up very nicely and you come to love Jin, but my love for Mugen was there from the beginning.  Overall, i'd say it was one of the greatest viewing experiences i've had and I will definitely watch it again sometime soon.  Don't hesitate, if you have a heart and/or a brain you'll realize this is definitely worth looking into.\

    A lot of people compare Samurai Champloo with Cowboy Bebop and with good reasoning; they were both directed by the same person and all have similarities with each other. Samurai Champloo takes the key ideas of Cowboy Bebop and takes that jazzy space feel and turns it into old school hip hop with samurai. Even with both of these shows sharing key ideas, Samurai Champloo uses its characters, setting, and art to break away from being seen as a rehash and more like a new take on the episodic action genre in an entirely new world.\
Story: The story follows three characters, Mugen, Jin, and Fuu\
          \
        as they travel across Japan searching for the samurai that smells like sunflowers. The story follows an episodic type of narrative that gives a different scenario each episode, making the protagonists gain another step towards their goal. I felt that each episode offered something new, introducing a small story each episode that kept you interested from beginning to end. Some of these stories were so well done I found myself revisiting some past episodes. The setting is done nicely and makes it feel like a realistic world. The only problem I have with the story is that I wish there was more focus on the main plot as well as the episodes. Only fractions of the main plot are revealed in the episodes and you feel that the episodic plots are stronger than the main plot.\
Art: The art style in the anime is very stylish, mixing both classical Japanese art with the graffiti of modern times. The animation is smooth during the action and the backgrounds are beautifully.\
Sound: The soundtrack is just like the art. Classical Japanese music mixed with the old school hip hop. Even with the two being completely unrelated they fit together perfectly. The opening and ending themes are both enjoyable to listen and I found myself listening to the tracks multiple times. The sound effects in the anime was a bit basic but it fit the sword fighting and the environment.\
Character: The three main characters all act completely different.Mugen is wild and crude,Jin, a is calm and well mannered, and Fuu acts cute but also ugly at sometimes. All three of these characters together are likable and interesting to discover who they really are. I did find Fuu more like a damsel since is the one that always gets captured throughout the show. I actually liked the other characters more than the main characters. The supporting characters in each episode are all very funny and the episode villains make good opponents to the main characters. I just felt that the main characters didn't have enough development as the show progressed and they never changed who they are.\
Enjoyment: Overall this show was enjoyable from beginning to start. The action is awesome, the humor is hysterical, and the drama kept you interested the entire time. What made it so enjoyable was the mixture of the hip hop to the sword fighting giving you an awesome mix of sound and action. \
I was entertained the entire series.\
Verdict: All and all if you like action based series with a great soundtrack and are into episodic adventures, you should give Samurai Champloo a try. The only problems I had with it was that the main story wasn't focused on as much and the characters do not really develop throughout the series.\

    There sure are a few reviews for this series... well I enjoyed Samurai Champloo. Honestly. I really did. What kept it in the air was definitely its characters, they were truly classic. Mugen (meaning infinite) and Jin (virtue) can easily be compared to what people from the Kalymnos Greek island describe as the two forms of manliness. \
Mugen runs along the course of what would be described as a 'stud' or stallion. A man who has no care for the consequences of his actions, eats excessive amounts of meat (as to prove his masculinity), an individual in all rights, and is simply wild and unkempt.\
Jin\
          \
        is the personification of this other manliness, simply put by inhabitants of Kalymnos as a family man. He is conscientious and thoughtful yet strong, a man who would sacrifice for those he values.\
Fuu, I don't know any other way to put it, is the woman (Strange though it sounds as she is only around fifteen). She brings in a much needed feminine quality to the wandering trio, keeps them in line and reminds them of mental things like sentimentality. Simply said, she is the glue. She is the reason they're on the journey, the reason they stick together, and the reason they'll part.\
I'm not a fan of rap or hip-hop, fortunately Samurai Champloo doesn't force the fact that it has hip-hop elements down your throat. It has just the right balance of subtlety and attitude to be good no matter what your taste in music is, and I have to admit the hip-hop culture references were a big part of the comedy for me.\
If the characters kept Samurai Champloo in the air, it was the animation that got it off the ground. The pointedly cartoonish characters were drawn in a refreshing and clear manner with solid lines and not a hint of simplicity, right from the tiny cherry blossoms on Fuu's knife to the insane expressions.\
The story (and I don't want to say unfortunately) is functional insofar as it allows the three characters to go on a journey, however it does allow the series to cover a vast array of Japans colorful Edo period. Including references to Van Gough, the dutch, foreign policy, christianity, and the Tokugawa governments ban on all daisho (samurai weapons).\
To say this is a masterpiece is an overstatement, but to say it was a great way of using an old modus operandi for a new story is honesty.",

    What's not to like?  \
Champloo means mash-up or re-mix in Japanese, an this is exactly what this show is.  It re-mixes the classic ronin samurai story with modern pop references, and a strong hip-hop vibe, and does it brilliantly.  It's got action, it's got drama, it's got comedy, strong character development, great music, and solid direction.  People I know who claim to abhor anime, still fall in love with this series.\
It balances a very thin line of being a serious story with out taking itself too seriously.  But like all the best stories in the world, this one shines because\
          \
        the characters are well developed, and the story flows through them organically instead of being forced to march forward around them.  In addition to the characters, the stories, being a mash-up if you will, uses the Edo period to comment on modern society, from the sex trade, to art, to literature, to religion, and even atomic warfare.  And it does so without being preachy, or condescending to the viewer.  Instead of just being Important Themes that jump out at you, they work through each episode in a much more subtle fashion, something missing from a lot of anime.\
I dare you not to like it.  There really is nothing else like it anywhere, (except for maybe cowboy bebop which was made by the same people).  This is a unique anime experience, in fact it's just a unique story experience in any storytelling medium and is definitely worth checking out.\

    Samurai Champloo is a show from the same creator of Cowboy bebop, Space Dandy, and Kids on the Slope. So if have seen or have any interest in any of those shows, than you might like this. Like the shows I just mentioned this series can be very episodic, meaning the over arching plot for Samurai Champloo is pretty bare bones. However, its episodic nature does allow for some more variety in terms of genres. The show can be full of awesome and bloody action, hilarious and goofy, with some occasional drama that is pretty effective. \
Personally, I found when the show goes into more\
          \
        dramatic territory, such as going into a couple of the main characters' backstories, the emotional impact it had on me could have been stronger. I will say that that my belief that the show's drama could be stronger sometimes might just result from the fact that I can not stop comparing Samurai Champloo to one of the creator's earlier works, Cowboy Bebop. The two shows have some very similiar characters and characters' backstories.\
That being said the real draw of the show are its amazing action and suprisingly good comedy. The soundtrack is mostly made up of hip hop and R&B. Intially, you might think that these genres of music go well with actions scenes that have plenty of samurai, ninjas, and swordplay, but the music fits all of the action perfectly. The action is beautifully animated, bloody, and well choreographed. Samurai Champloo has some of the best sword fights in anime that I have seen. The show also injects plenty of humor to things from getting to stale and repetitive.\
Samurai Champloo is a great show for anyone who loves action. Especially the bloody sword fighting kind of action. Also the Dub is great, because Steve Blum voices one of the main characters. And if you have seen a lot of Dubs, you know that Steve Blum is awesome.  \

    Might i venture into my first review? I have several animes that i liked but none have compelled me into writing a proper review like Samurai Champloo(SC). Partially because I feel that this anime is under-rated - even though its still quite popular. \
Story (9): I think this might be the dealbreaker for people who came looking for a deep complex plot but end up with mostly episodic comedy, vaguely stringed along in this epic search for the \"sunflower samurai\". Ok, that \"main\" story is not entirely original too but I think you have to appreciate this anime from another starting point. Its not really\

        meant to have a heavy backstory and has always been more Gintama than say, Naruto. Every episode consist of an epic turn of events involving the 3 protagonists as well as how they manage to resolve each one and continue forth in their journey Being someone who hates pointless plots, I actually find SC's story extremely enjoyable because even though we are being teased with some shady ambitions of finding the sunflower samurai, the ultimate redeeming factor (that really exceeds expectations) is the hilarity and tastefulness across all episodes. I've never seen this sort of spontaneous, almost random humour done sotwell and yet have the drama, emotional parts done so tastefully. \
Art (10): Ambitious and genius - urban historic japan. Totally creating a new style of its own. Its not like explaining why this pasta creation is better than other pastas from other places. Its like asking me to explain why i enjoy chocolate cake altogether in a world of pasta restaurants. Okay, bad metaphor but the point is, how do you explain why you like chocolate cake?? Its just all the right ingredients, baked just perfect. Its not just a superficial mash-up like adding graffiti and rapping to parts of the story but its how the entire character and story is developed. Mugen can be talking and walking down some dark alley in modern tokyo and no one would bat an eye. He'd still be the hooligan (imo) easily in both time periods. \
Characters (9): I always fall in love with the character first before the story. And I love Mugen and Jin! How they are polar opposites in their personality and how that ripples into their speech, style and swordplay. Such detail to character design really shines through and throughout the anime. It also adds such flavour to the fight scenes- one of the highlights of the anime. The way Jin cleanly slices and the way Mugen sporadically spars. My only complaint is the difference in the development of each character. Jin's development is good but pales in comparison to Mugen. And Fuu is the worst of all. Its almost like the sole purpose of her existence is to tie the sunflower samurai story together. Her character never feels fully developed, is pretty generic/replaceable and gives the overall feel of being a small supporting role. Its a shame because I really don't think they meant it to be this way. This is the reason why I can't give 10 even though I'd really like to.. Maybe if there had more episodes they would be able to bring her character to life. \
Sound (10): 11/10 if i could. Outstanding music in the anime. At first it might strike as odd because its like mixing hiphop/jazz in a historic edo japan anime but the music really ties it up nicely. If it wasnt for the music, that theme would have failed miserably, striking people as more awful and awkward. By the second episode, I thoroughly enjoyed the opening and ending. Beside Durarara's opening, I havent had another anime where I would sit through all the openings and endings so patiently. I really enjoyed the opening and ending. Such great choice of music! Also throughout the anime, the music blends amazingly well even when its reduced down to just a hiphop beat repeating through a particular dramatic/fight scene. Its perfect when the music thickens and when it thins. Its rare how music can so strongly carry the theme of the anime, almost like the theme came from first, the choice of the music. Its reallly sad that the music theme producer for the anime died at a young age, such talent! Just based on music/sound, I would rank SC number one across all anime. \
Enjoyment (10): Outstanding because everything about this anime is playful, hilarious and tasteful. The humour is alittle r-rated, alittle random and spontaneous, alittle crack, alittle witty. What else can you ask for??\
Overall (10): Outstanding! A piece of art! Really worth the watch. One of the few anime I can imagine myself rewatching!\

    Hands down one of the best anime ever made. It doesn't lack in any department, but it excels in the action scene. \
There is too many reasons why I think so. Let's see:\
- No real antagonist / protagonist (I mean, the three main characters are: a criminal born on the worst place imaginable, a ronin that killed his master and a girl who's father betrayed the country by choosing another religion)\
- Vulgar language / One of the best dub's ever (We all like curses and rotten words, and here its dealt like free candy)\
- Both Mugin and Jin are overpowered (except against that blind girl\
          \
        and at some points at the end, but other than that... hell, these guys butcher their way through a mountain of corpses)\
- Stupid and awesome humor (I mean, every episode is a combination of awesome and LOOOOOL awesome. The humor is easy going and understandable but quite funny to get a laugh, a smile or even a smirk from you. Also Mugin is as simple minded as they get, so you can always expect quality bullshit humor from him)\
- Dirty and Honest (Not a ton of ecchi and none is shown, but throughout the anime the whole recognition of whores, sluts and what not is openly shown and in some episodes the driving engine. The anime is rotten dirty, but not perverted in the standard ecchi anime way)\
- Not a huge goal driven anime (Sure, there is the main plot but that's just the anchor that characters move towards the series. The real plot twists happen every episode and they are all different. Its basically a Slice of Life anime with every other element, especially action. You get hooked on fast and hard. Its like heroin, but free and not as damaging)\
- Enter random wise sentence here\
Just watch it if you haven't. 26 episodes, all of them worth it.\

    The only thing this brilliant anime lacked was in art. I found the art in Samurai Champloo to be sloppy and it made me feel bad about the series.\
On the whole, it has the classiest cast I've ever come across - the twists and turns which lead to the ending are in my honest opinion, balanced and match the atmosphere of the story. The way it kept a light humoured attitude was also acceptable in my opinion, because it matched the serious moments and complimented them as well.\
On the whole, its a good watch. I liked it. And I'd recommend it.\

    Samurai Champloo is so amazing that you shouldn't be reading a review about it written by a fatass sitting at his computer mashing at a keyboard. You should be watching. Like, stop reading now, and start watching it.\
Okay, still reading? I'm honored. Let's get the review then, shall we?\
Story: 9/10\
The overall plot is that a girl named Fuu is trying to find the samurai that smells like sunflowers, and two samurai, Jin and Mugen accompany her. However, that's not really the main focus of the show. Every episode has sort of its own mini plot, and they're all fun and awesome. My personal favorite is\
          \
        the one where they play baseball with a bunch of Americans. I've never laughed so hard in my life. I had to pause the episode so that I could stop hyperventilating.\
Art: 9/10\
It's actually pretty good, considering that it was made in 2004. The fights are solid, and the sword action is fluid. There was really only one episode with a noticeable drop in quality, but that's about it. The rest was a wonder to behold.\
Sound: 10/10\
This has probably been said a billion times before, but what jazz did for Cowboy Bebop, hip-hop did for Samurai Champloo. The soundtrack is great, and the opening is fantastic.\
Character: 10/10\
Each character is unique and awesome in his/her own way, even the ones that are only shown for one episode. The way that the three protagonists bicker is pretty hilarious, and they all get equal character development as the show progresses. Mugen is my personal favorite. My personal favorite \"character that showed up for one episode\" was the gay assassin from episode one, who had one of the funniest lines in the show. You learn to love them all.\
Enjoyment: 9/10\
This show is so good, writing this review is making me feel nostalgic. You know what? I'm gonna go rewatch it now.\
Overall: 9/10\
Would laugh hysterically as Mugen beats the shit out of fat American men again.\

    Champloo can be translated as combination. Indead, Samurai Champloo is a very good combination between comedy and drama, it uses elements from hip-hop culture like graffitti, break dance style. What I liked about Samurai Champloo was its soundtrack which was composed on hip-hop beats and it was outstanding.\
When I watched Samurai Champloo, I had the feeling that nothing really important was happening. Someone said to me: there are some type of events that do not change completly the personality; those events are meant to icrease the experience level. \
In conclusion, I consider Samurai Champloo to be an experience trip, not only for Jin, Mugen and\
          \
        Fu, but also for us, the viewers.   \

    Just like Cowboy Bebop, Watanabe once again leaves us an anime that has almost no story and intense amounts of filler episodes. The action sequences are phenomenal, but I cared next to nothing about any characters in this show. \
Bebop is almost all style and little substance, and so is Champloo. I wish Watanabe would care more about his stories, instead of focusing on useless filler content that neither increases character development or pushes the tale forward.\
Almost every character in this show is static, and virtually none of them are memorable (there is no Radical Edward) \
Watanabe’s attempts at backstory fail because they still give\
          \
        you little insight, or just cliche insight into the characters. The animation is top notch, very fluid, and just like Bebop there is a fair bit of witty banter, but this can’t entirely save a series. Regardless, it was a fun ride, and it’s certainly a very watchable anime.\
I seem to be one of the few people that loves short anime programs, considering the love for shows like One Piece, Naruto and Bleach all which have countless episodes of nonsensical filler that I simply don’t enjoy. If you’re going to make an anime with only 26 episodes, a large amount of them shouldn’t be filler. Virtually none of Berserk is filler. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has 64 episodes and I honestly wouldn’t consider any of them filler.\

    Samurai Champloo is by far one of my favourite animes of all time. It's the perfect mix of story, action, art and music.\
The whole anime has this really urban feel around the entire thing; the music, the characters, and the environment. The creators really managed to get the music and the story to flow really great. The combination is so fantastic that those annoying side episodes that take away from the plot aren't annoying at all.\
The story itself also actually has depth to it and this whole sort of intrigue has to who the sunflower samurai is and why Fuu wants to find him at\
          \
        all. And the characters are really in depth as well. So to speak, everyone has a history. And even though you know next to nothing about Mugen, Jin and Fuu you get really attached to them and you feel like you know all about their character.\
And of course, the best part, the fightining. The fights have this great artistic fluidity to them, which comes from the style they're drawn in, but also the way they're animated. It's like this really great bloody dance. that's another great point to, there is a lot of blood. They don't try to suger coat the deaths at all which is what makes it great. And however odd it sounds even the spray of blood seems like it was perfectly planned.\
Samurai Champloo is simply the most brutally artistic anime I have ever watched; and I love it!\

    A greatly recommended anime by many, very nice action scenes going on, not really surprising having that director, but feels very lacking in story.\
Have you seen before a carefree protagonist who ends up being friend with a serious and quiet person and they have another friend that is ok but can terrify them when gets mad? And then you have those super original plots like the montrous guy that actually had a gentle heart, the thief that just wanted to buy his mothers medicine (sometimes this one appears just trying to feed his orphan brothers), the assassin that was being black mailed but wasn't a\
          \
        bad person... it's hardly a shounen cause it lacks an enemy development, obstacles and stronger foes they have to overcome, the story is pretty casual, but it's not all comedy oriented also, the unique thing they develop is the hip-hop culture things they add to Edo Japan, but the only good stories are the ones that were divided in two parts.\
Overall the story is good but nothing special, same thing for the characters, but it have a great direction and great action scenes, very good art and animation and also very good sound track.\

    To be honest, when I first embarked on the journey of watching Samurai Champloo, I didn't expect much from it. At the time, I was quite persistent and would only watch Shoujo anime. Yet my friends kept pestering me and telling me to watch this anime, so I finally gave in and this anime not only exceeded my expectations, but also opened up a door to a whole new genre of anime that I was now willing to watch.\
Story: 8/10\
Even if this is indeed my favorite anime, I must admit that the story itself in the first couple of episodes was a tad cliche. However,\
          \
        it gets progressively better and the only reason it started out being mediocre is because it needed a plot to expand on, so it could develop its episodic structure. \
Art: 10/10\
I find the art to be very aesthetically pleasing. The scenery was done beautifully and none of the characters were bland.\
Sound:10/10\
As I'm sure most of you already know but, Samurai Champloo is hip-hop based. For me, this has to be the best ost I've ever heard in an anime. (Please do keep in mind that I am not, nor am i anywhere near being a veteran watcher so my opinion isn't absolute)\
Character: 9/10\
Something I considered a very minor flaw was that the anime doesn't go into depths about the pasts of the characters so we know very little to nothing about their history. However, every character is different and all of them have their own idiosyncrasies but that is exactly what makes this show enjoyable.\
Enjoyment/Overall: 9/10\
Overall, I enjoyed this anime quite a lot and if you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend you do so.\

    Story: 6/10\
The Main plot of Samurai Champloo is that (the girl) saves (the two leads) from their execution in exchange for helping her find the samurai who smells like sunflowers, and the second they complete this promise they’ll be able to duel each other to the death. While they are allies for the most part, that doesn’t really mean that they get along all that much, and they all are pretty selfish at times. In fact most episodes they split and go their separate ways somehow all colliding into each other by the end of each episode. There are quite a few serious issues dealt\
          \
        with in Samurai Champloo, which are handled way especially considering the time period of the show, although the amount of times Fuu gets captured against her will, is a bit annoying but she can times handle herself just as well as the two males leads (though it was pretty funny when she references this in the recap episode). There is an overarching storyline, but it’s more of an episodic show, or most of the entertainment comes from the journey to reaching the samurai smelling of flowers, though since quite a few of the episodes tie up in a nice little bow by the end there isn’t too much to compel me to press play on the next episode. The ending doesn't feel anymore special than any of the other story arcs, and it finishes a little anticlimactically. Speaking of Mugen, Jin, and Fuu...\
\
Characters: 7/10\
Mugen \
He’s reckless, selfish, and pretty arrogant. He’s an incredible swordsman without the best technique. I love hearing Steve Blum’s voice, but all I can think of when I hear it is Spike. Wished he would have done something different like he did for Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. \
He’s entertaining to watch, but I’m pretty neutral towards him overall. \
Jin\
A Master Swordsman with a whole samurai school after him. He’s a lot more meticulous and reserved with his actions than Mugen is almost complete opposites in that regard. He’s very intuitive and get suspicious easily. He is also cares about others more than Mugen, still he is pretty stubborn as well.\
Fuu\
My favorite main character without a doubt. She’s the catalyst of the story, and is the most good natured of the three. She really seems to understand people, and she’s able to get to the root of their problems. She never really fights people head on, but looks to avoid the unnecessary deaths of others. She can be a bit hot tempered, but her pros outweigh her character’s cons by a landslide. She’ll put herself in face of danger without hesitation if the reason is grave enough even though she isn’t much of a fighter. \
\
Animation/Art Style: 9/10\
The Backgrounds look fantastic, and the amount of red reflection from the sunlight around twilight hours is just the best. I love the shading and how detailed the backgrounds are, plus it reflects the beauty of Japan’s vegetation and landscapes greatly. The character designs leave a little to be desired. I mean the main characters do look different from all the supporting ones, but I’m not in love with any of it in fact some of the expressions and character designs leave me scratching my head.  Though I love how the main characters can look different/ be drawn differently but they still resemble and embody the character as much as the last one did. The art style isn’t really consistent, but that is a positive in my book. It really shows how much detail was put into each frame. None of the expressions make me want to gag like they do in GTO, so everything is alright. The fight scenes are as fluid or even more so than Bebop, and they really enthrall the viewer. Overall, I can tell that a ton of work was put into the art, and the backgrounds are a sight to behold so I can forgive some lacking character designs.\
\
Sound: 9/10 \
Has a really slick and interesting hip hop soundtrack that can get you jazzed and even works really well despite the fact that the show is set in a feudal Japan. I love how much variety the soundtrack contains and even if it starts out smooth and relaxing it can build and and swell perfectly to accompany the emotions that scene is going for. I hate whenever they use record scratches to transition between scenes or characters. While I love the music in the show, whenever they actually beatbox or rap in the actually show not as background music it’s kind of cringe worthy and weird. The opening  looks fantastic, and it summarizes the show pretty well. The music is chill and badass at the same time, but it isn’t the most memorable of songs. The music is nothing to write home about, but it’s at least fitting. The animation at the beginning is gorgeous, and they still frames that follow also look great.\
\
Enjoyment: 7/10\
“There was a fly in my face, get off my case.”\
Samurai Champloo is a slow burner of a series. It isn’t the greatest, but the time you spend watching the show will be worth it. The art style, animation, and opening and ending animations are all fantastic, and are Champloo’s highpoints. Production wise the show is marvelous, but I can’t really get behind the story or the characters much. It’s not show I was emotionally invested in while I was watching it. Champloo is an enjoyable eye pleasing journey.\

    I started Champloo not because of the Cowboy Bebop hype train or anything, I started it because it looked cool, and unique—so I actually headed into this with actually no expectations at all, just a blank sheet. In the end, I left the anime with a smile on my face. One show worth navigating through.\
The trick to enjoying Samurai Champloo is to know WHAT it's about. The whole episodic thing should actually be a hint to everyone, that the focus of this story for the most part isn't the Sunflower Samurai Hunt; but just a wild adventure between three complete strangers in a nicely recreated\
          \
        Edo Japan. Champloo generates a fantastic environment the way Assassins Creed does, but also adds various hip hop 21st century references everywhere, making for what I'd like to call the \"Champloo Experience\". In the end the only thing that matters initially story wise would be Fuu, Jin and Mugen's adventures and the events that actually draw them closer subconsciously. Champloo tackles heavy topics—slavery, prostitution, persecution of Christians and homosexuals and such with a real air of spunk, adding comedy into the mix but always keeping just enough in to keep the necessary seriousness. The Sunflower Samurai tale finally comes back into focus around the 18th episode or so; and 'til the final episode, those who decided to stay on are treated to a fantastic fitting unraveling of events, filled with skilfully animated battles and quick, effective development for our three heroes. Champloo maintains its uniqueness from start to finish, creating a rhythm for itself and staying true to it, and despite the end bring rather abrupt when it came, you somehow feel that it is for the best. Simply put, Champloo ends on a funky, good note. \
If you're looking for very quick exposition and plot development, this is the wrong place for you. I started SC in December but only finished it this month for exactly that reason—compared to Parasyte and such, Champloo really took too long to showcase its plot, and even I lost patience with it at the 7th episode. But I came back and powered my way through, which in the end was very worth the journey. So yeah, if you can't deal with the long wait for actual plot advancement, don't take Champloo up—you'll hate it. The story receives an 8/10 in my book, because with the exception of one episode, all the others contained good subplots, and the eventual Sunflower Samurai thing was great as well.\
You can't mention Samurai Champloo without acknowledging the brilliance of Nujabes (Bless his soul, RIP) and the others. The track is truly funky and groovy, with a sick beat. Nujabes' touch is all over Champloo, glossing over the Edo period with this unique hip hop/beatbox soundtrack, which feels awkward at first, but truly ends up being artful throughout. The score, was nailed spot on. There's really nothing else to be said about the music, save that it's revolutionary. Great OP and ED too. The artwork is also very good, with well drawn environments and characters—along with very well animated fight scenes (and there are  loads of these). The fight between Mugen, Jin and Kariya was easily the best rally win the whole show, fully badass stuff. Art and Sound receive an 8/10 and 10/10 respectively.\
Characterisation here mainly revolves around our three heroes, Mugen, Fuu and Jin. While Mugen and Jin are the fighters here and genuinely the more mysterious ones compared to the loud mouthed bimbo Fuu, the irony is that Fuu ends up being the most truly mysterious one until the end. We get a vivid portrayal of Mugen and Jin, two polar opposites. Mugen is a rogue, a wild and arrogant man with a short fuse and generally a repulsive one; plagued by a violent past and certain inner insecurities. Jin is a silent, non committal man with a high sense of honour, and a generally more intelligent person; though equally as immature as Mugen when it comes to spats and such—chased by his dark past and wandering in search of his true purpose. Fuu is kind, optimistic, ditsy and often annoying, a vain girl who however is very committed to her goal of hunting the Sunflower Samurai. Though very diverse, the camaraderie which reluctantly develops between the trio is rather touching to observe, as the two men subconsciously put themselves through a variety of hardships for Fuu's sake, and she does the same for them too. The final two episodes show just how close the three have become, as each are willing to sacrifice for the other, bringing into a kind a VERY relevant quote from earlier on the series:\
\"When you travel with people, they become like your own family.\" \
Mugen, Jin and Fuu become exactly that, after a series of comedic, tragic and uplifting adventures. Family. 9/10 for characters.\
Samurai Champloo can be draggy at times, but when the fun starts, it's thoroughly enjoyable. Overall, Champloo maintains the fun factor; episodes that lead nowhere in terms of plot tend to build up the main trio even more, and the antics of our three heroes are generally very humour plus and well directed.  8/10 for Enjoyment.\
Overall, Samurai Champloo is worth watching for those among his that are more sensitive towards culture and artistry; and for those of you who just want to chill and enjoy a long anime ride, this one IS for you. Onwards to Nagasaki!! \

    First when I started watching this on tv, it didn't take my attention because the character designs are really bad in my opinion. I tried to watch this one but the series is awful to watch for me. I like shoujo and shounen too but this one is surely not my style and it will never be. \

    Samurai Champloo is one of my favorite anime. I would recommend it to anyone reading this review.  \
Story- The story of Samurai Champloo is about a group of 3 people in Feudal Japan trying to find a “Samurai that smells of sunflowers”. I know this doesn’t sound like a great idea for story, at least that’s what I thought when I read the description on Netflix, but it is a great story. The story is episodic but it still pushes the plot forward in each episode. It gets more and more exciting as the 3 get closer and closer to finding the Samurai. Episodes\
          \
        can range from very funny light hearted episodes that will have you laughing the whole time, to badass fight episodes, to emotionally gripping and tear-jerking episodes that really make you feel for the characters. Another great thing about Samurai Champloo was that not a single episode was repetitive. The only downside to the story is that it is a bit simplistic. I rate the story 9/10\
Art- The art of Samurai Champloo is very high quality and well done. It fits the whole style of the rap and Feudal Japan themes. The animation doesn’t have a single flaw to mention, the fights were animated very, very well and they looked amazing. Although it fits the themes well and it is high quality, I personally dislike this type of art because all of the characters look kind of like water paint blobs with really dark outlines around them. I give the art 9/10\
Sound- The thing that makes Samurai Champloo unique is the sound of it. It seamlessly blends a weird but good rap music theme with a Feudal Japan theme (Champloo means blend hence the name, Samurai Champloo). I know that sounds weird but trust me it’s actually very good. It is one of the most unique styles in anime. The opening displays this mix very well and kind of shows you what you’re going to be getting into when you watch the show. Not only that, but the opening sounds good and gets you hyped for the cool action sequences and the fun of the adventure. The soundtrack, while not a masterpiece, still fits well with the show and its theme and adds to the immersion. Also, the ending song is superb. Definitely one of the greatest endings of all time. 10/10\
Characters- This is where Samurai Champloo truly shines. The characters are on par with Baccano, Hunter x Hunter, and even Neon Genesis Evangelion. I loved all three of the main characters because they were all so unique, well developed, and generally cool people. There is Mugen: a samurai that is a badass and always gets in fights and says cool stuff; Jin: Another samurai who is more calm cool and collected, but still badass when he needs to be. Fuu: The girl who got them to help her find “the samurai that smells of sunflowers” and is funny. All the characters are absolutely hilarious. I give the characters 10/10\
Enjoyment/Overall: I enjoyed Samurai Champloo very much. I laughed my ass off countless times while watching this series. Every episode was a new, exciting, adventurous, and comedic installment in the series. I give Samurai Champloo a 9/10. Don’t’ get me wrong, I love this series to death and it is probably one of the few anime series that I could see myself rewatching in the future, but a series has to truly be in a whole other league to be a 10. Samurai Champloo is basically a 9.9 for me, it’s the closest 9 to a 10 on my list.",

    Samurai Champloo is a story about the love of two powerful swordman who pretend to hate each other so it won't be a gay anime. Theres also a woman Fuu whos out for revenge and along the way we have a very Cowboy Bebop kind of adventure which means great characters and great adventure.\
The Story like I said. Its about two guys who are really strong and fight all the time through japan while paying off a favor from a girl Fuu. Theres more filler than anything ever but the gay episode is really funny. I leave to you guys whether the two main guys\
          \
        are gay too but they probably are. Ive seen pictures online of deleted seens.\
The Art is great with blood and lots of stylish action. It actually looks like japan more than most shows do. I dont like the stupid rap they put in.\
The Sound is really bad and really good because they use rap which suck and they use instruments which are great. The composer should be happy but should also be really angry that they overshadowed his work with this stupid crappy hip-hop.\
The Characters are almost always coming across as gay or in the closet, usually having nothing to do with women. I find this very unsettled with me, but its just intertainment. They are action stars though which makes up for it and they have stinkt personalities.\
The Overall show is very good because of the action and comedy but I dont like the gays or the raps in it. I wish they would just choose message and send it like WHAM, instead of beating around a bush.\

    Going into Samurai Champloo, I noted that  it was directed by Shinichirō Watanabe, the famed director from the legendary anime Cowboy Bebop. Going into it, I had exceedingly high expectations as Cowboy Bebop is what I would consider one of the most well done, deep animes I've ever watched. Although, looking back, it was unfair to Samurai Champloo as a series. While it may always live in the shadow of Cowboy Bebop's success, Samurai Champloo is a wildy entertaining, deep series that stands on it's own as a magnificent achievement.\
It essentially follows the same format as Cowboy Bebop. It follows three characters; Mugen, Jin\
          \
        and Fuu as they explore across the land of feudal Japan in search of a mysterious Samurai that smells of Sunflowers. While the backstory itself isn't anything spectacular, the story of Samurai Champloo suceeds on its ability to ensnare you  with wonderfully likable characters, gorgeous settings and clever writing. It is episodic in the same fashion Cowboy Bebop was, but this works in it's own way. \
Samurai Champloo was as much of a technical achievement as it was in storytelling. The art is spectacular and the animation is smooth and flows unlike most animes you've seen. The fight scenes are well done and the pacing is superb. Overall, it's an excellent anime, but not without it's flaws. The story, while entertaining, can drag on. It wasn't quite as well paced as it's spiritual predecessor in terms of character development and personally the subject material wasn't quite as strong. Still though, if you liked Cowboy Bebop, or if you just like anime in general, Samurai Champloo is a must watch. \

    So far this anime as been awesome not only do I get to samurai fighting and so on don't want to give spoilers well it also have everything one could want from a anime. One of the main things is audio if you have dual audio you will understand that the English version is 10x better because one hand you have the sometimes cheesey, annoying and serious Japanese version; then on the other hand you got in the place of the cheesey parts you have a posh English voice I should know I am British and the other voices are just awesome in there clarity\
          \
        and how they vary. \
The music is very good when most of the time some people don't take this into account but you have to it one of my main sources of enjoyment. \

    I enjoy Samurai Champloo. The animation is good, and the characters are well drawn and interesting. The combination of hip hop culture and feudal Japan is pretty cool. However, there are a few things that are annoying. The show has an obviously negative portrayal of westerners and, when they aren't made out to look evil, they're made to look stupid. It's also funny how the show tries to give the ancient Japanese credit for a few western cultural and technological developments. These aren't big gripes at all, first, mostly because a lot of western animation (older western animation specifically) does the same to the east.\
          \
        And, second, the show doesn't take itself seriously, and can also portray the Japanese negatively in many cases, and also makes it obvious that all cultural elements in the show aren't exactly accurate (beat boxing and graffiti painting Samurai). \
The story elements from episode to episode seem to get repeated often. Jin, Mugen, and Fuu start each episode either hungry and seeking food, or tired and seeking shelter, or both. When they find their destination, they are met with a conflict. Either they need money to pay for something, or Fuu gets kidnapped, or both. Then, the problem gets solved in some way with one of the bad guys showing a light side. They begin their move on to the next town, and there is another mention of the mysterious 'Samurai who smells of sunflowers'. And yet, many times I found myself immediately watching the following episode even when I didn't have time to, just because I wanted to see what would happen (mostly in the two part episodes).\
The visuals are great. I love the way the characters are drawn, most of which not having the stereotypical anime look (except for Fuu...). The animation is also great, as it often times is very gestural and exaggerated for effect. It works very well.\
Overall I would recommend the show. \

    \"I have no desire to kill you. In fact, you're not worth killing. Killing you, would only tarnish my blade.\" - Jin\
Time and time again I've iterated that there's no such thing as \"perfect\". Perfection is impossible to have, because it's whole ideology is completely subjective. What's perfect in one thing is not necessarily going to have a unanimous agreement between people simply because their opinion on a particular thing's perfection is like I said subjective. Nevertheless we always see things get close to it. Coal mines were overtaken by steam, which in turn was overtaken by all the renewable energy. It's not perfect, it's\
          \
        what people think is close to perfect. Now out with the normie beginning, I'm here to talk about one such thing that has inched ever so closer to perfection. No prizes for guessing what I'm talking about. Yes. Samurai Champloo. \
Samurai Champloo is a journey. Or in this case you could say the journey is Samurai Champloo. It's not just Mugen, Fuu and Jin going off on a journey. It's us viewers as well. Traveling is all about meeting different people, visiting new places and making friends here and there. But people miss the important part about traveling. The feeling that remains in us while we do the journey and once we end it. Samurai Champloo in that sense has achieved a perfection here. It beautifully showed us how our emotions go about when we travel, albeit in Edo style. \
I haven't even stepped into the music category (which is the single quintessential reason I can keep this over anime greats like Gintama and the like). \
The way how events unfold and move forward is so natural and realistic it made me feel as if this isn't an anime. Many people regard anime as an escape from reality, which is definitely true, but there's the other side of the coin. Anime showing us reality in a different way. Samurai Champloo takes the latter route. Either there was an independent episode or there were arcs, both excellently flowed the plot to us and left us in awe of what's next. Some parts made you grit your teeth in suspense. Why? It's because Samurai Champloo knew how to handle the emotion. Not once did I feel as if I knew the outcome of a battle when our two sword fighters were engaged with a tough opponent, and for a media like anime, or action itself for that matter, it's applaudable. Even in the final arc, I was taken aback by who lived and who didn't. No spoilers so don't worry. I was never a fan of Historical anime, but much like Gintama, it was not only bearable but enjoyable. From the first episode to the last, much like it's music, Samurai Champloo beautifully showed us the story it had to tell with one-or-none plotholes and the like. \
If you've seen my list and stats, I haven't watched many Manglobe anime, yet I consider myself their fan after Samurai Champloo. The art was breathtaking. I can find no other words to describe it. Maybe groovy I guess? The fight scenes were a huge highlight of the anime, and for great reason. Unlike most other studios, Manglobe knew how to incorporate suspense and awe-inspiring knitty gritty action scenes. And for both of the main samurais, Jin and Mugen, had their own unique fighting style and the animation proved that even further. The amount of detail as well dedicated to the backgrounds and the character design as well were beautifully done.\
Samurai Champloo arguably has the best soundtrack of all time. Why? It's because there was one composer who contributed a lot to the anime, Nujabes. Battlecry has become larger than the anime itself and although it doesn't get featured much on any \"best anime OP\" lists that certainly doesn't mean it's not amazing. If the anime was more popular I'm sure it would get the attention it deserved. The rest? The background music went slow at times and scary at times. It perfectly did it's job as background music, to create a feeling within us which the main activity can't do, ease in emotions in us. Take for example a scene where Mugen was about to walk over to someone in rage, the drum beat that played definitely raised my hair on end. \
Shiki no Uta had me dancing, snapping to the beat. I got so engrossed in the soundtrack overall that it took me just a few episodes to learn the lyrics by ear, something that NEVER happened to me before. It wasn't just Nujabes and Minmi doing all the brilliant work on the OP and ED respectively, but the others as well. Never have I ever seen inserted endings go on par with the actual endings, which are already so amazing no questions asked. Another thing, never have I ever turned up the volume when listening to an ED so much while watching an anime episode. If 11/10 existed, the music section and Nujabes himself for that matter, would have it given by me in a heartbeat. Pardon the pun.\
If you read my normie opening paragraph at the beginning, you might remember that I said nothing is perfect, even though the concept of perfection, much like right and wrong is subjective. Not being perfect doesn't necessarily mean something's bad too however. In terms of Samurai Champloo, the characters prove that point. The weakest part of the anime (if 8 is considered weak) are the characters. Mostly because of the villains. Let's start with our main characters. \
Fuu was very irritating throughout the anime, I found myself rolling over in irritation each time I heard \"Himawari o-samurai-san\" since it got repeated each and every time in almost every episode. I may sound like I'm exaggerating (which is true) but this was the one thing I got pissed at each time at the anime. Apart from that her performance in the final arc did a complete 180 of my view of her. The episodes leading up to the final arc as well highlighted an amazing new door to her personality in my eyes.\
Then we have Mugen. I can see why many viewers would love a character like Mugen especially since he's so badass and in many ways cooler than Jin, ahem, literally. Since most of the episodes revolved around Either Mugen or Jin (with the final arc being the sole exception as it was focused on Fuu, but you could say it was equally focused on all three as well, but as for those two, they) got one episode or an arc dedicated to them each and it kept rotating between them until the end. This was especially good since we weren't tired of following only one person on multiple continuous arcs. His backstory, much like the other two was not the most positive thing you'd hear for a guy that badass, the middle of the anime will explain further if you're interested, I'm not spoiling anything :P. From the first episode till the end, we saw 26 tantrums, but we got 52 epic fights and quotes, literally. Don't go counting up everything now :P\
Jin. At first I was on Team Mugen but sooner rather than later I switched to Team Jin. Why? It's because Jin is the literal example of \"cool\". His backstory isn't lacking either. Rather, on a personal note I found Jin's backstory much more relevant to the plot and more badass than Mugen or Fuu's. Much like his demeanor, he silently crossed the ranks and became my favorite character in the anime. I don't know about most other people, but I loved Jin as a character because he was fleshed out as one himself. The arcs that focused on him focused in his past as well and I feel even though all three characters' pasts were equally explored, Jin's backstory was one that gave out more detail. And sadness too.\
Then why an 8? The villains. None of the villains had even half a proper motive for what they did. I expected Sara's arc to give out a well designed villain but unfortunately she too was poorly designed. So much for the drum beats and Mugen's rage. Once again, since there's no context no spoilers. Don't worry and carry on. Apart from that other villains themselves did no better. At best to contradict myself I can say the villains had half a motive but none had a full one. All of them felt cliched in on way or another and since this is the first time I used that word in this whole review that's saying something as well. Nonetheless, if not for Jin and Mugen's backstories and Fuu's final arc performance, even a 7 would be tough to achieve, let alone an 8.\
If the score and my words didn't directly show it to you, I'll make it direct, I'm a huge fan of Samurai Champloo. I came expecting something worth a 7-8 and instead got a show worthy of a 10. Faults are present yes, for that I'm willing to slice off 0.4 out of the score, but they're not worth anything more. Story? Excellent. Art? Breathtaking. Music? Listen to Shiki no Uta and let it do the talking. Characters? ..... Brilliantly designed main characters and bad villains I suppose. Nevertheless, to end this on a positive note (if all this positivity and small amount of fanboying weren't enough,) Samurai Champloo may appear to be just your everyday quiet Samurai anime with boring historical references and an even boring sound track, rest assured you will get the EXACT 180. You're gonna get the most hip (and hop) anime you'll ever see kono yarou! \
P.S: Fuu was as she said the only main girl, so waifu corner is now Husbando corner for the second or third time ever I guess. Anyway to make it short. Jin best boy B)\

    When I first heard about this show, I was looking for anime set in more urban environments because, at the time, I was sick of fantasy and historical fiction settings. They weren't bad, I was just tired of them. I almost blew off the show on the basis that it was set in Edo Japan. Then I read that it had many hip-hop and modern influences, and contained music with a general rap and jazz-hop soundtrack. So I gave the show one episode to impress me.\
It delivered, to say the least.\
Sound 10/10\
This is how I discovered Nujabes, and all the others that worked on the\
          \
        soundtrack. It's not for everyone, however. The majority of the songs are instrumental hip-hop, so if you aren't into that you won't like the soundtrack. But, if you're like me, and that's your favorite genre of music, you'll get what you want and more. Nujabes, Fat Jon, Tsutchie, and Force of Nature the did most songs, with Shing02 doing the intro and MINMI doing the outro. I can not stress how much I love some of the songs in this anime. Battlecry is the rap intro, and at first it seems like Shing02 has no flow in this song. Once you hear it before every episode, you start to hear the more subtle beats Nujabes made, and by the end it all works perfectly fine as an intro to this series.  Other songs in the soundtrack, such as Counting Stars, are emotionally powerful and work well with the visuals. I like this outro, but it's much more eh to me compared to the mindblowing rest of the soundtrack.\
Characters 9/10\
At the beginning, Jin and Mugen are, to say it bluntly, suicidal. They just don't care if they die, they have no purpose. Fuu convinces them to be her bodyguards, and the only reason they stay together in the beginning is because Jin and Mugen want to kill the other one. Slowly, over the course of the story, you learn why the characters are who they are today. As they learn from each other, they slowly start to warm up to each other. At the end of the series, you can tell that they truly care for each other, and are all willing to give their own life for another one. \
Story 9/10\
This is a very episodic anime. You could skip episodes 3-20 and understand everything perfectly well. However, it's the journey that counts. The overarching story, if you can call it that, is just looking for a samurai, and nobody knows the name, look, or really anything about him. It's not winning any awards for that plot. But the episode to episode plots are masterfully done, and express the main themes of freedom, and sticking it to the man. Many episodes center around people being trapped, with no place to go. Everybody reacts to this in different ways. Some cling onto the hope that things will get better with time (spoiler: they usually don't), while others decide to do something about their crappy situation, and usually prosper for doing so. The show doesn't shove this moral in your face, either, which is quite nice.\
Art 8/10\
The show holds up surprisingly well for being made over a decade ago. The fight scenes are fluid, and I didn't notice any animation errors. The character designs are easy on the eyes thankfully, and fit right into the Edo setting. On the other hand, the scenes of just talking are much less impressive that the fight scenes, but don't ever veer into boring territory.\
\
Overall, despite the average of my scores being a little more than 9, I give Samurai Champloo a 10/10, making it my favorite anime ever produced.\

    I always see accusations that this is a well done clone of \"Cowboy Bebop\" and often I find it hard to deny it. However I think this is because both of these shows do the same things near perfectly, and the loose story that keeps them together is in the same vein.\
Some of these similarities are a ragtag group of young adults who go on a quest to find someone from a main character's past. Cool chill beats play in the background, often setting an interesting tone for very tense scenes. Slowly on this journey the backstory of the individuals come to light, and they\
          \
        learn that they were almost fated to be fast friends.\
However, I'm going to come out and make a bold claim. Samurai Champloo did it better. Nunjabes' contributions to the soundtrack are the crux of the sounds of this series. The fights were both visually and audibly impressive, where I couldn't take my eyes off the screen when I felt a song crescendo coming up. And the songs are never the same, they are constantly moving, flowing, and shifting to fit the tone and depth of the scene at hand. While this is the standard answer for this series, it is undeniably the best thing this series offers.\
This doesn't mean it's the only thing, however. The characters backstories are slowly shown, yet they are given a unique air of mystery. Where sometimes it felt like Bebop would say, \"ok this is a Faye/Spike episode\", Champloo wasn't afraid to drop hints periodically throughout the series. You'd have gems of recognition for Mugen, Jin, or Fuu. References to their pasts that help build their characters as \"already existing\" in the world the writers created. They had history that affected their actions now. Where Bebop would only have these histories relevant in these \"character episodes,\" Champloo could bring them up at any time to try and sway the situation in a new direction. I feel this kind of depth is often hard to find.\
Overall, this turned into more of a defense of the series as \"a clone.\" Yet, even if all of those arguments fell on deaf ears, this series is a must-watch for an impressive display of sound and art design that should be emulated more often in series to come after it.\

    5/10.  (THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS)  If you're interested in a non-fanboy review, enjoy the read, my apologies, it's rather long and thorough. \
TLDR: The story is extremely lacking, and Characters have 0 development. The whole anime can be summed up in about 6 episodes, instead of 26.  It's pretty much 20 episodes of filler.  Good, filler, but pointless. Beautiful, fun and exciting, but with nothing to tie it all together.\
I had tried to watch this anime years ago, and watched as far as episode 4.  It was okay, but I had this nagging feeling, even back then, that it was\
          \
        going to be a disappointment.  Several years later, after hearing some of my friends rave about how good it was, (yet again) I decided to give it another go, and this time I dedicated myself to watching the entire series...and I confirmed that my suspicions were correct.  It wasn't as good as everyone kept saying it was.  There are a few factors on which I like to rate anime which are in no particular order:\
1: Depth of Character\
2: Art Style\
2.5: Combat\
3: Music (Including absence and timing of)\
4: World Depth (locations, magic, religion, society etc.)\
5: Quality and Depth of Story\
So, lets start with the First.  Depth of Character.\
Despite what everyone says, depth of character in this anime is fairly lacking.  The characters do have strong characteristics, in which they each have good screen time, and they play off each other very well, however, it becomes painfully predictable.  I continually hoped that there would be character development, but was poorly disappointed.  Mugen remains a spontaneous immature man, Jin remains stoic, and Fuu loves food.  And that is it...for the entire 26 episodes.  Are they fun Characters?  Absolutely.  But that's not enough.  There were many little fun plot drops, like the assassin who decides she is going to marry Mugen.  The 'who does Fuu like?' question that is never really fulfilled. Jin's temporary romance with a prostitute. Mugen learns to read, but nothing comes of it.  Tons of potential for character development, but then episode ends and the next one has nothing to do with the last.  It was extremely disappointing. At the very end (which I was also disappointed with) they finally realize that they are friends and like each other... so As far as Character Depth?  2/10\
2: Art Style.  The art style in Samurai Champloo is fairly amazing.  I would suggest this is the strongest supporter for the anime.  From the detailed environments, to the beautiful sunsets, to clothing and facial expressions.  The art is surely not lacking.  Now, if you prefer a more modern style, perhaps like Hellsing Ultimate or One Punch Man, than you may be a little let down.  The style is definitely a little older, however, I felt that this was a strength rather than a weakness. I really enjoyed the bizarre mix of edo era Japan with break dancing, hip-hop and graffiti.  It oddly gave a strong charm to the anime which was reinforced with the artistic style.  8/10\
2.5: Combat.  Everyone I've talked to about Samurai Champloo mentions how good the combat is.  The martial arts, and the choreography. I however, was not impressed.  The combat primarily consists of one man charging the other with his sword held up, and the protagonists simply takes one dodge, one cut, and one kill. Rinse and repeat.  Now, admittedly, when you are dealing with a huge skill imbalance as presented in this anime, yes, things often would go like that.  But it's certainly not very entertaining to watch, especially when the main characters would then arbitrarily be overpowered and captured. It was a little inconsistent with their 'might'.  Now, there were a few scenes in the anime which you could describe as 'boss fights', which were quite entertaining to watch.  There was some great art, and choreography involved with some of these scenes. The first introduction fight between Mugen and Jin being one, and then fighting Kariya, the second.  Very good representation of duels.  Other than that however, I was left wanting. The more I watched, the more I realized that it was a lot of camera spinning around the combatants as the 'swayed' dodging each-other's attacks, with white lines drawn to symbolize their misses, which looked okay, but it wasn't actually all that good.  All that said, this is definitely a huge step over older anime in which a lot of combat was just a panning still images, but still, it's not as good as everyone makes it out to be.  I would give combat 7/10.\
3: Music.  The music was really good.  Even if your not into hip-hop, like me, you can still really appreciate the general aesthetic that it provides the anime.  It tremendously lends itself to fulfilling the quirky and fun world that the creators were going for.  There were also several great piano pieces, as well as some classic Japanese style songs.  All that said, in some anime, the music really takes the cake.  Thinking perhaps of Death Note, and the power that the music is able to portray is almost unparalleled.  So in comparison to the use that music can have in an anime, it is perhaps a bit lacking in Samurai Champloo. However, it certainly adds more to the anime, than subtracts.  I would give it 7/10.\
4: World Depth:  I really enjoyed the world.  From the landscapes, to the weather, sunsets and flowers and trees.  All of it was well placed and artfully done. The locations did feel different.  There were different levels of 'business' at each of the locations.  A small travel lodge was adequately inhabited by wanderers or hunters, where as a the larger cities had much more busy streets with many shops.  The world felt well populated and laid out, including the maps that they showed in the anime showing their journey. The religions were a bit interesting.  There was some sort of 'underground Christianity' that was going on, which turns out to be more of a cult but it's significance is not ever really fleshed out.  Additionally to that, my favorite episode was the one where they stumble across a 500 year old mining camp that is inhabited by zombies.  It was eerier, unnerving, fascinating and unique. There were also some political drives in the background, but unfortunately, these were never fully explained either.  The World seemed to have more than was presented, but was also lacking in it's detail, which left me wanting.  They gave a fair amount of world info 'just in passing' which is fine, but I would have appreciated more.  6/10.\
5: Quality and Depth of Story:  And finally, the part which was completely lacking in the anime.  Seriously, this part fails completely.  The story is, 2 guys journey with 1 girl to 'find the Samurai that smells of sunflowers'.  This is given in the first 2 episodes. Aside from one flashback and maybe two assassination attempts, Nothing Else Happens till episode 24.  There are almost 20 episodes of nothing.  Literally Nothing happening!  In the One flashback it is obvious that the man she is seeking is her father. And the two assassination attempts reveal a little more about Jin's background.  And that is literally it.  It was extremely disappointing. There is one episode where an assassin decides she is going to marry Mugen.  But then she is never heard from again.  What happened to that plot line?  There is another episode where Jin 'falls in love' with a prostitute, but then that episode ends and nothing happens.  There is even an episode, get this, where a meteor falls on top of them, and then the next episode their just walking on their way again.  Nothing matters.  Absolutely nothing that happens has any importance, relevance, or lasting meaning in the anime. Nothing!  It is one of the most disappointing anime that I have ever seen.  The only development happens in the last episode, where Jin and Mugen realize that they are friends and they don't want to kill each other, and then they go their separate ways.  Which is a huge let down. And that is it.  Done. Bye!  I mean, really?  That's the best your authors could do? You could really just watch about 6 episodes in total and have the whole story summed up and done.  And that to me is a huge failing in any anime.  I'm definitely biased in this, but I'm giving it a 1/10.\

Going into this, all I knew was that it was directed by the same guy who directed Cowboy Bebop, so I was expecting to have a familiar feeling here, the only difference being the show's setting.\
Story (10/10)\
The story of Samurai Champloo is actually a very simple one, showing a trio of characters on a journey through Edo era Japan as they fulfil the wish of a young girl.\
Now even though the main story is really simple, it works a lot like Cowboy Bebop where each episode has their own story, some even span multiple parts. True it was a little slow to get\

        going, but once it reached the first two parter which was very early on, I was pretty much hooked for the rest of the series as each episode kept surprising me in ways I wasn't expecting, just when I thought I knew what was going to happen the show would do a complete 180 and make me think \"Oh sh*t I wasn't expecting that\", so I'll give SC a lot of credit for surprising me a lot of times.\
I also liked how the series nicely spaced out the random episodes and the episodes that concentrated on the main characters, giving us more backstory on them, plus you can slowly see overtime as the relationship between the main characters grew more and more, true they bickered all the way to the end, but you could tell they genuinely cared for each other by the end.\
I really liked the subtle messages in some of the episodes too, like how trade with other countries has started to change the lifestyle of the Japanese, how corrupt shady organisations can be and the way things are changing in Japan has made the Samurai decline more and more as more conventional weapons like guns are being introduced, I always like smaller details to the plot that actually have some historical elements to them.\
Now the biggest problem with Cowboy Bebop is probably the ending, here the ending was done in a very decent manner, sure it's sad seeing the characters splitting up and going their separate ways, but it fitted for me, I wasn't really expecting them to stick together forever and this seemed like the best way for the series to end.\
Characters (10/10)\
Despite the main focus being on 3 characters, these were 3 exceptionally amazing characters, who each got their time to shine in this series along with some interesting side characters too.\
Fuu Kasumi is the main heroine of the series, she is the one who is looking for someone, who seems to be special to her and smells of sunflowers, although she isn't exactly the easiest going girl as she'll whine or shout quite a lot though for good reason and doesn't mind standing up to people despite being weaker than them. She also has a kind heart as she is willing to help people albeit whether she has been forced or not, she is a glutton too and was really funny seeing her transaction from skinny to fat in a matter of moments, much like something from Scooby Doo.\
Mugen is a dude with a sword that Fuu just so happens to meet by chance, a rude, vulgar and mysterious person who only cares for himself, Mugen is a legend of a character. His mixture of martial arts and sword fighting make him a badass fighter, yet he can get a little cocky or overconfident in some fights and does get overpowered a few times, until he manages to bounce back. He was also a great source of comedic relief and his disagreements with the other characters just made him an awesome character.\
Jin is the other MC alongside Fuu and Mugen, who just also happens to coincidentally meet these people too, compared to Mugen, Jin is his total opposite. He is a lot more civil, mature and fights in a more traditional way compared to Mugen and these two often but heads a lot throughout the series which builds up to the eventual fight they have, Jin is another mysterious character, but his backstory was very interesting and his monotone expressions always made him a hidden gem for comedic moments.\
Art (10/10)\
It's always nice to head back in time and see an anime that isn't even remotely touched by CGI and for good reason too, because this is one well done anime. It's creates the Edo period of Japan very well and really shows the difference of the continuing changes on the country from the trade by foreign countries like the USA, for example the different attire people are starting to wear, Mugen being a good example of that and the different types of food being introduced too.\
The animation for the sword fights were also done incredibly well, some of the best sword fights I have seen in a long time.\
Sound (9/10)\
Although the visuals for both the op and ed were amazing, there was something I just couldn't entirely enjoy about the op and ed, the ed just didn't seem that interesting mainly and I did like the music for the op, it just wasn't something I would listen to often.\
The soundtrack however is a different story, rap is definitely a weird musical piece to have for a Samurai series, but it worked really well and seemed perfect for when Mugen and Jin had to kick some serious ass.\
It was also pretty funny seeing some of these elements in the episodes where we see random people doing beat boxing or having out of place hairdos that just made the show even funnier to watch.\
Extras:\
The action was done really well, it was quick, thrilling and suspenseful it always made you wonder who would come out on top as each enemy the main characters would either be stronger or more intellectual as they would use different methods of fighting, so the fights never got boring or repetitive for me which is a big plus.\
The comedy was just brilliant, the constant jokes and disagreements between the main characters was just hilarious and it stuck out till the very end, it was a nice change from the amount of anime's I've seen where the characters mostly agree to doing this certain thing, however here the main characters just disagree with everything unless it's food, which made the chemistry between so much better as the respect for one another grew slowly over time.\
Enjoyment (10/10)\
Overall (10/10)\
Overall this was an amazing Samurai anime, probably the best one I will ever see in my lifetime, because it's going to be damn hard to beat something that has brilliant characters, a well done story, amazing artstyles, a fun soundtrack and some kickass action. Samurai Champloo is a true definition of a Samurai anime.\

    When I review anime, a 7 is a 70% which means the anime was average but nothing special. I noticed most people would say that was worth a 5, or a 50%, but that is an F. If an anime didn't have any obvious flaws other than being nothing special, then I don't think it failed. So please read my reviews with this in mind. This is why most of my ratings seem on the high end. If I enjoyed it enough to finish it, it should be getting a C, not any lower.\
I can't wait to get roasted alive for saying that this show\
          \
        was pretty average, not the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life. Samurai Champloo is certainly a good show, but overall I didn't feel the impact I was expecting to to its extremely positive reviews. In the end I was a little disappointed, but not dissatisfied.\
Story(6/10)\
The story is certainly not a reason to watch this show. It is very similar to Cowboy Bebop in the sense that it has a backstory that becomes relevant in the last three episodes, but before then it's just a random scatter of events. The real story is within the characters, which I will get to.\
Art(6/10)\
The artwork was fairly decent, though it was very dated. Of course, how old it looks shouldn't matter that much. My main issue here was that the characters often look almost unrecognizable at times because their faces would change shape. Th same goes for just about everything else in the show that was animated.\
Sound(5/10)\
I was not a fan of the music, clearly. I almost never noticed it, and it had little impact on the intensity or emotional ability of scenes. When I did notice it, it was usual a few notes repeated over and over and over, and it was pretty annoying. The redeeming quality here is that it was pretty unique and had a quirky feel that matched the quirky characters quite well.\
Character(10/10)\
Up until this point, it seemed that I thought the show was a total flop, no more! The characters were absolutely superb. I can't quite put my finger on why, but I loved that characters. Al of them were developed well, they all grew and matured, they were all enjoyable, they all seemed purposeful, and they were all entertaining. hat should just about sum that up.\
Enjoyment(8/10)\
This show was very fun to watch. There was cool action, great comedy, and characters I actually cared about. twas all carried along at a nice pace, and it ended on a good note right before it started to drag on. \
In the end, I was expecting a little bit more from Samurai Champloo, but it was still definitely worth my watch. I don't recommend this show to those who expect a complex or relevant story, any amount of romance, or fan service. I would recommend this to anyone interested in historical feeling anime, fans of action, comedy, or really just anyone looking for an enjoyable well paced show.\

    This is the best anime to ever exist. It's too bad that it all had to come to a crossroad end. We will never see another masterpiece like this. The music is the best! Too bad Nujabes & Manglobe are no longer with us in this world. Rest in Beats Seba Jun.\
Even artists like MINMI & Ikue Asazaki have contributed their lovely vocals which give the anime life. While watching each episode, you feel absorbed, as if you were actually in that world. The concept itself was amazing. Loved the characters, especially Jin, Mugen & Fuu. Jin, although being born in the Samurai class, had\
          \
        to leave and put his true skills to the test. Mugen on the other hand, was a no good pirate that finally found a family that he could be a part of, after he was betrayed by his scummy friends! Fuu on the other hand is a sweer princess who deserves much more. I feel bad for their fates, but in the end, it all changed and I am glad it all ended with 26 episodes and wasn't dragged on.\

    Stylized and cool is what this anime strives to be above all else.  Without a doubt this show is nice to look at and has a distinct style to it.  The action scenes are an especially nice treat.\
This show takes up an episodic style with our three main characters going from area to area in search for the samurai who smells of sunflowers.  There are plenty of great episodes, but the problem is there are two or three episodes that simply are just bad or out of place.  Additionally, the main plot line, the aforementioned samurai who smells of sunflowers, is\
          \
        weak and only surfaces to give our characters are reason to move on to the next stop on their journey.\
Now as for characters Mugen carries the other two leads on his back.  Neither Jin or Fuu are bad characters, but Mugen is given so much more background and development throughout the series that the other two just fail in comparison.  Hell, even his appearance in the first episode overshadows the other two. \
The soundtrack is comprised of mainly funk songs and the intro is a slow stylized rap, while the ending is smooth jazzy and calming.  This really adds to the atmosphere that Champloo goes for.  \
Basic Idea:  Our three heroes, and a squirrel...rat....thing (mandatory cute animal friend of our female lead), are on a journey to find the samurai who smells of sunflowers.  Throughout their journey they run into problems and resolve them.  More is relieved about our two sword wielding friends throughout the series and we start to understand their ideologies and behavior. \

    I don't really like writing or reading long stuff so I'll keep it short and clear for all of you guys. This is my first review so bear with me.\
Samurai Champloo is a great anime with pretty interesting story, good art and cool music. This action-packed series has its fair shares of comedy, fights and just enough of characters' backstories. The characters' personalities are decent and not just some cliche though they are similar to ones you've seen and yet they are interesting and likeable. You can see their development through the story as they encounter all sorts of problems and people. \
It's not often\
          \
        that I enjoy a series this much and that I know I'll remember it. Samurai Champloo is now one of my favourite animes which means I find it really well-made and one you don't see every few seasons.\

    My all time favorite anime, there is a perfect mixture between serious and humorous scenes. The story is very insightful and really well done as well as the characters as each one have their own unique personality. The music is really what this anime is known for, RIP Nujabes he really poured his heart out on the soundtrack as well as Fat Jon. The blend between the scenes and music is really a work of art. I will probably re-watch it soon. The journey this anime takes you on is incredible. Words can't describe how good this anime is. A perfect short anime not too\

    Style : Look, there goes a baseball breaking a tower, unusual dead men digging for treasure, Americans talking like Germans, Germans talking about homosexuality and while all of this happens, there's this hip hop thingy going on in the background. A huge of fan of music maybe, You wonder, (Read in Jin's voice)what's it? Someone's rapping, no wait, someone's on the DJ, fuck, the style of this thing! The greatest weapon in the artillery of Champloo is its undeniable, ravishing and extraordinary style of doing things. There is so much mediocrity overcome, superseded and overshadowed by the style. The presentation is so state of the\
          \
        art that caring for the substance is dismissed as petty and, the need of a story? Pfft.\
Art/Animation : The animation, even in the Blu-ray I watched, was dated, very. It looks like the producers didn't want to/or were too lazy to up the quality or maybe the original master was lost. In any case, I believe the animation could've been a lot better than the current 'watchable' status quo. \
Soundtrack : Feeling a bit dizzy? A bit high or maybe sad? Don't worry, we here have all of it. The soundtrack is, again, one of the ups of Champloo. Its shelf has enough for you to be be immersed in whatever randomness that goes on.\
Characters : Here for some of those greatly built characters? One you can talk to, to your IRL/Online friends? Nope, this ain't that kind of anime. Particularly, this is one of those places where Samurai awards you with a slap. The character writing is downright lazy. If you know what I mean, insert one of those \"had harder lives, become ignorant and mean over the years\" here. The three characters as usual go on a journey and there's nothing much to be cherished in their souls. \
Story : The biggest flaw of Champloo is it doesn't get any interesting right upto the latter part of the midway. Samurai Champloo is a remix and mash up of all of Japan, damnit, I get it. But there are so many badly written fillers in there that it is almost unbearable before things start getting interesting. The humour only takes birth in pure form in the last 6 episodes wherein, an amazing episode called \"The Baseball Blues\" ups your opinion of the show.\
Conclusion : Samurai Champloo could've been a huge success and a straightforward classic if it didn't suffer from all that bad vision in direction and writing, in my opinion. It works as a satire for sometime and then falls into pits it stood up against. It hits the jackpot a tad bit too late for the viewer to hold on to it. But when it really does, it almost feels like a miracle. A lot of unnecessary fillers but some of the great ones make Samurai Champloo a hindered yet nearly fulfilling experience. \

    samurai chapaloo is a story about guys with swords brake dancing and if that's not cool then i give up on anime as well as life. now i cant really keep talking without mentioning the dam story its not good and basically consists of 3 parts. two  of with finish in ep one. \
STEP 1. heroes group together\
STEP 2. heroes go to find person\
STEP 3. the find person\
Yea so not that strong but then what is strong on it is the art. it is new and very well reminding me of cowboy bebop. The action is amazing with Mugen doing a bey-blade while hes\
          \
        killing people but cutting their necks and stuffand thangs (please get the reference ).  Now the characters was hard because Mugen is such a strong character where as the other two mains are not. you have fuu is forgettable and does pretty much nothing but get captured and prove time and time again that she is more useless than god dam Sakura and Suckura is really useless. And then their is Jin  a stereotypical samurai that does not break any boxes. There are a couple strong side characters like cops that's wear only loin cloths and the like and of course if you are making a anime about a break dances bro who kills mafia just to get laid the music is important and as such it is great and has a couple songs on my iPod but hey none of that matters the real question is was it enjoyable should i try well in short yes watch it now.   \

    Samurai Champloo overall starts pretty promising. Two samurais;Mugen and Jin polar opposite in their personalities, are wrangled together by a waitress named Fuu in order to find a samurai who smells of sunflowers. The characters are fun in their own ways while not extremely interesting, the show doesn't follow traditional anime cliches, the action, violence and art are all extremely flashy yet artsy in a strange way, and the show is condensed into a nice 26 episodes; perfect time in my opinion. However my main gripe with the show is how the plot commences, it mainly consists of Mugen, Jin and Fuu's misadventures (and it\
          \
        feels like a LOOOOT of filler), but very little looking for the sunflower samurai. This makes parts of the show really repetitive and predictable, and even at the climax of the show, the payoff is pretty meh. Overall samurai champloo is a very entertaining anime, but I personally wasn't wowed by it in any way. It's artistic, and it is as cool as it tries to be, but I felt that Champloo was far too scattershot to live up to Bebop, it's predecessor.\

    Hello there. Trying to find out more about Samurai Champloo to see if you want to watch it? Well, let me start by making this clear: you MUST watch this anime!\
There are enough sources about the general storyline, so instead I will just say that it is well-written, coherent, well-paced, and absorbing! Our three heroes, Fuu, Jin, and Mugen, go on a great journey, and will take YOU along. They travel through Japan, encounter many kinds of people, and get to do many interesting and funny things besides fighting. The numerous intentional anachronisms you can find bring a great touch of humour. You get to\
          \
        learn a lot about Japan too.\
The character development is amazing. The main characters have distinct personalities, styles, and pasts. They form an unlikely trio considering how different they are. Fuu, Jin, and Mugen grow throughout the episodes in a very pleasant way. You will get attached to them. The other characters they encounter are for the most part very eclectic and add to the fun.\
The music is some of the best anime music out there. There are a huge number of songs that bring the anime to life, give it rhythm, and are very recognisable. In fact the OSTs are well worth owning (downloading them is fairly easy too).\
The art is nothing mind-blowing, but it is good and perfectly suitable for this anime. The battles are particularly interesting. The only bad detail that bothered me in some poor CGI that was used for about only 10 seconds total.\
How did I enjoy this series? I watch Champloo every year. Enough said.\

It is also my first review (yes, I love Champloo THAT much!)\

    I think I was much too young when I first watched Samurai Champloo on Adult Swim. Now that I have had a chance to grab the new DVD thinpak, I was able to rewatch and properly asses this show. Most importantly, I really would like to see this Manglobe studio get out there more. Ergo Proxy, Champloo, Bebop and all their other series have a very unique journey feel about them. They make some of the best stuff out there artistically too, so more series in the future would be a godsend. \
Story; 9. It's episodical. And it's on and off, although only three or\
          \
        four episodes got on my nerves. The individual stories were all very cool, and enhanced by the insane and creative cast. The artistry here, you will find, is so off the hook. This series is really in a leauge of it's own even among the other Manglobe works, because the artistic flare here is much, much more over the top. In a very good way. The stories all had next feels about them, from gangland to drama, and even a very stylistic zombie episode. As expected, the philosophical value is present but also welcome in it's subtle presentation. It took a sure backseat to the fun, which I was very okay with.\
Art; 10. This is the second best part of Samurai Champloo. This is the most unique, artistic anime I've ever seen. It's great, the urban theme is prevelant in large part to the lanky, streamlined drawings that moved so strangley between fluently and erraticly; it's the coolest thing you'll ever see. Colorful, creative goons abound; this series boasts a carnival of cool characters, from a Brooklyn accented baseball ninja to a double agent geisha; and i'll never forget the marijuana farming battle monks. The main cast is great too, but they wouldn't have been as great without such great side roles. Jin is my personal favorite.\
Sound; 10. Anime music sucks, and there's no argument against this. It's bad; Samurai Champloo's soundtrack is something I listen to all the time. I would love this soundtrack without the show. It's a work between Nujabes, FORCE OF NATURE, and Fat Joe, as well as cameos by many rappers and MC's like Shing02; suffice to say, if you are a hip-hop and turntablism head like I am you will love this soundtrack so much. The mixing is great, the OP and ED are both awesome. Every track is a crazy soundscape, and art aside the soundtrack mixes classic japanese folk with hip hop seamlessly in a way it's a sin not to hear. Phenomenal, easily the best anime soundtrack ever.\
Character; 9. Jin is a silent, reserved badass. Mugen is off the walls, with a unique combat style rooted in fairly creative breakdancing, and Fuu is the classic helpless teenage samurai girl. They are all also a satirical representation of samurai action cliches, and they are presented in this way flawlessly. I'll save details, but these three are really great characters individually and together.\
Enjoyment/Overall; 9. This show is artistically unchained, musically perfect, and paced quite well. The characters are inventive beyond compare, and that journey feeling is really exclusive to this studio. I felt it more in Ergo Proxy, but this (especially with it's killer final scene) had a really really soothing, down to earth reality about it that you should experience just as much. Champloo is a great show, especially when your old enough to care. Don't pass it up.\

     What initially attracted me to Samurai Champloo was the fact that Nujabes had composed most of the OST. But when from the moment I watched the first episode of Samurai Champloo, I knew that it was different, a very good kind of different. From the funky hip hop thematics to the fluid, thick, black line animation, Samurai Champloo became more to me than an anime with a good soundtrack.\
\
Story: 8.9/10 \
Here we have three strangers in the Edo time period setting off on a journey to find a \"samurai that smells of sunflowers.\" Samurai Champloo focuses on these three... But at the same time\
          \
        it doesn't. Most of the episodes are of the trio getting themselves into trouble and trying to get out of it, but it's these situations that subtlety ties the whole storyline together. Through every problem that Fuu, Mugen, and Jin get themselves into, the more they rely more on one another until the final episode when they realize how much they care about each other. The small morals about courage, loyalty, and friendship are really pleasant as well, even though the anime insists that it's nothing about that. Although it didn't give me that life changing impact by the end of the show, Samurai Champloo will still stick out to me for it's unique presentation of story. \
Characters: 8.5/10 \
The thing I like about our main characters is how different they are from one another yet they fit each other so well, like Yin and Yang. The total opposition in personalities that they all have balances out and creates a trio that makes Samurai Champloo filled with excitement, humor, and drama. Additionally, each one has a hidden past that creates more interest. Mugen, rash and straightforward, relies on instinct rather than intellect. Jin, conserved and traditional, uses his bright mind and level headed-ness to get him through situations. Fuu, ditzy and demanding, keeps the two in check all the time. These three start out as distant strangers in the beginning, but we can notice an unbreakable bond form between them as the story carries on, which makes Samurai Champloo even more precious.\
Sound: 9.5/10\
The sounds of Samurai Champloo stuck out to me very much. What we have here is a mix of funky hip hop beats with traditional Japanese Edo era music. It exemplifies the counter-culture feel even more throughout the series. The opening and ending are both unique and amazing songs. Nujabes, shing02, fat jon, and Minmi used their talent to create an OST for Samurai Champloo to remember. \
Animation: 9/10 \
Samurai Champloo's animation was another huge factor that made the anime unique from all others that I've watched. The thick-lines of the people and the beautifully fluid animation from the fight scenes made Samurai Champloo incredibly fun and easy to watch. Considering how it was made in the early 2000's, the animation is definitely impressive. However, there are some scenes that seemed like the animators slacked off and didn't put as much effort. Nonetheless, I adore the fluidness of Samurai Champloo.\
Overall: 9/10\
Samurai Champloo has ranked itself among the list of anime never forgotten in my mind. I truly believe that it's considered a milestone in anime history, considering its unique presentation, music, animation, and subtle yet sweet story line. Any type of fan could easily get themselves into this show. Everyone should consider watching Samurai Champloo, it won't be something that you'd regret! ",

    Another anime I love. The story plot really has its twists and you really don't know whats going to happen next, its quite interesting. Its also funny and darmatic, plus alot of action which I love. The characters are also lovely, if you look at their personalitys and the clothes they are wearing you may notice something ^_~ The art is amazing as well, I find it to be quite detailed, especially the fighting scenes. I can't think of any downfalls, at least at this very moment. I find the anime to be all around amazing.\

    Top notch anime with non-stop action comedy in hip-hop fashion.\
Set in the romantic Edo period, Samurai Champloo tells the story of three companions as they make their way through Japan in search of the \"sunflower samurai\". All the while delivering, irreverent humor, storytelling and action.\
The blending of hip-hop/rap culture with the unique feel of the Edo period puts this series on a class of its own. Personally, I'm not a fan of hip-hop but its integration into the genre was so well done, I'd almost want to go b-boying on the spot. It's not an exaggeration to say that what it achieved is a breakthrough\
          \
        among its contemporaries.\
Aside from its unique style, there is an interesting story that is told along the way. The backdrop of old Japan has a distinct flavor to it, and although the series certainly contains a lot of anachronisms, the story never feels out of place. Those who enjoy period dramas will certainly not be disappointed. \
The art was extremely well-made. This is where a lot of the Edo period flavor comes from. Each scene is highly detailed, and sharp, well-choreographed action compose the entire series. This is not one of your cheap shounen anime where a fight scene looks like it was made up of 3 frames.\
Most of the music comes from the hip-hop/RnB/punk genre. I found myself enjoying most of the soundtrack even though I don't listen to ANY of those genres at all. At no point did the soundtrack hurt my uninitiated ears. The performance of Nakai Kazuya, who voices Mugen, has become one of my favorites. Whether its serious or funny, his rendition of a cheeky Okinawan ronin is simply excellent. \
It's a great series that leaves no regrets and characters you'll remember. Yes, there's basically only 3, but those three are way more interesting that a lot of the moe hordes of today. \
When it's being funny, you'll laugh, and when it's telling a story, you'll listen. But mostly, it's just one big whacked-out ride. Absolutely a must watch for anyone.\

    This anime has some well made tits...if this caught your attention read on. If tits description is all you care about skip to Art section.\
But seriously, this is my first review...so cut me some slack guys...Now let's dive right into the actual review.\
\
If I could, I'd give Samurai Champloo 9.5...This is what got me into watching anime...I marathoned these theries and rewatched them couple tmes...Shinchiro Watanabe(one of my favorite if not the most favorite director) as always was brilliant here.\
Now let's go over what made this anime so great.\
Story 8/10:\
The overall plot(which is described in pretty much everyu other review) is probably the weakest aspect\
          \
        of the series, but still very good. A cute, childish and extremely helpless girl accidentally meets two off the hook insane but loveable warriors who hate each others' guts and somehow makes them travel with her and be her bodyguards(which proves to put her into even more danger) in order to help her find her father. The anime pretty much follows their journey and adventures they encounter(very very fun adventures) and has some really fun filler episodes.\
Don't get me wrong because of the score I gave it...the plot is fun as hell and very enjpyable, but not bery deep. It does touch a lot of issues, but I wish it'd dive deeper into them.\
Art 10/10:\
there are tits...and tits...which are very well made....\
Made by Shinchiro Watanabe...enough said. \
But ill also note that this anime has made a sweet mix of hip-hop and Japanese Edo period culture. The overall art quality is top notch and if you think that visuals are important part of anime, you'll enjoy this one no doubt about it.\
P.S. to learn more about beautifully made edo-period tits ranging from prostitutes, to cougars to dudes dressed up as women watch it...you won't regret it, although I will admit that tits aren't the focus of this nime...ACTION SCENES ARE!!!\
Sound 10/10:\
It is very rare for me to watch the entire soundtrack of an anime every single episode...I did it with this one. Nujabes did a great job...I even have soundtracks on my phone...People who love hip-hop will love this anime.\
Voice acting was really outstanding, the english dub cast was pretty much the same as for Cowboy Bebop, and they really have done amazing job.\
Character 9/10:\
It is pretty much 2 warriors with completely different styles of fighting and outlook on life and a seemingly helpless, but often times very resourcefull young lady.(not too much tits)\
But you'll also encounter a wide range of characters with and without tits, straight and gay, Japanese and foreign, buddhist, christian, zombies you name it, they have it.\
Although there is some decent main character development, I feel like, showing more of the protagonists' past would make this anime so much beter and bring it to a solid 10.\
Enjoyment 11/10:\
If you want a fun anime to watch...this is it...beautifully made action scenes, fun plot interesting characters, don't have to think too much...just lean back and enjoy.\
\
Overall, I recommend this anime to anybody who wants to have a good time...meaning to everybody. I've actually shown it to couple of my friends who usually don't like anime, but they marathoned through it like crazy...\
hope you enjoyed the review.\

    Introduction:\
On May 20th, 2004, Manglobe Studios released the first episode of Shinichiro Watanabe’s newest directorial TV show since the incredibly popular Cowboy Bebop. The show then finished off almost a year with its 26th episode, on March 19th, 2005. Now before I start, I’d like to state something that will be pretty obvious as I start reviewing… I really like this show, despite its flaws and how much it doesn’t live up to its predecessor, Cowboy Bebop, I still really love this show. So with that said, let us start the review.\
Actual Review:\
So let's start with Samurai Champloo's story and setting, since they are some\
          \
        of the most interesting aspects of the show. Now Champloo's story starts off with a teenage girl named Fu, who lives in Edo period Japan and works in a teahouse. One day, while serving some men, she gets in trouble and is about to get her fingers cut off when a nearby swordsman named Mugan saves her. Afterwards, Mugan soon gets in a fight with the bodyguard of those men, another swordsman named Jin. The two after a long fight soon get arrested and with the help of Fu escape their predicament, but now they are in debt to Fu, and are forced to go on a journey with her to find a \"Samurai who smells of sunflowers\".\
Now you may think that would be the plot of the entire show and you would be only half right. The show is about that, but most of the episodes are vignettes, where the characters are involved in a certain situation that they solve by the end of the episode. It's a lot like Cowboy Bebop in that aspect, but unlike Bebop most of the vignettes are sadly not very original because of the absent of Bebop's screenwriter. Surprisingly enough, only the director and art team went to make Samurai Champloo, but in the end Champloo is able to take these cliché events and make them amazing!\
This all thanks to the stellar direction of Watanabe, and the execution of each episode. It also helps that the setting and art direction are very interesting things to behold. Of course you may be wondering what could possibly be so interesting about the setting. Well while the show takes place in the Edo period, Watanabe takes a very strange spin on the period which took place on the cusp of Japan's modernization. Instead of looking at the period as a time of dying tradition, he looks on it as a time of unrest and warring gangs of samurai. This may sound normal at first, but trust when I say I don't think the Edo period ever got so gangster, Champloo seems to like to intersperse the show with strangely out of place modern references, such as baseballs along with lots of hip hop and rap. To be frank, this really shouldn't work, yet Watanabe and the shows team somehow make everything in the show work. In fact, it works so well you don't even care about the historical inaccuracies of the whole thing.\
The art direction, as I said before is very good using interesting character designs and lines and shading to make everything pop. It also helps cover up some of the moments where the animation can be very meh, in fact the animation in Champloo can be very messy at certain points. However, with the help of the art and effective use shortcuts, it makes the show a master of its budget. In fact, like the story and setting, the direction and execution really makes everything amazingly good.\
This leads me to the big downside of the show, while it is very well directed and fun to watch, when comparing it to its predecessor Cowboy Bebop, it really can't hold much of a candle. Champloo really has a lot of similarities to Bebop, but unlike Bebop it isn't as mature and like I said before some of its vignettes can be very cliché. If you've watch Bebop before, you probably also can't help but notice the character similarities, Mugan is basically a crazier, ruder version of Spike, Fu is a less sassy version of Fei, and Jin is a quieter version of Jet. Really though, I find it unfair to compare the shows like this, while it may be disappointing that the characters and stories of Champloo may not have the same amount of maturity and development as Bebop, it still is a really good show. So what if the characters of Champloo don't really have their own individual arches and instead grow as a family, they still are compelling and have interesting back stories. Also so what if the vignettes aren't as mature or original as Bebop's, there executed well enough for it to not matter at all, it's just that good.\
After that comparison, I must talk about the final aspect of the show, it's music. Now I could probably just say, \"Nujabes,\" and leave it at that, but I don't think many of you probably know who Nujabes is. Now Nujabes is a producer and maker of music that blends hip-hop, rap, and classical into one song, it is amazing! This especially true of the soundtracks and openings and endings he worked on for Champloo, without this anime I probably wouldn't know who the deceased Nujabes is and I would be much sadder without that knowledge (He died in a car accident recently leaving this to be the only anime soundtrack he's ever done).\
Some of my favorite opening and ending songs have come out of this show, let's first start with Battlecry. At first the rapping and beat may seem awkward to this minimal animation opening, after a while though I could not stop watching the opening, it's just so catchy! Also when I say minimal animation I mean it, there isn't much in the opening but once again art direction makes it all amazing.\
Then there are the multiple endings, some which aren't even produced by Nujabes. Now the main ending Shiki No Uta or Song of the Seasons, while only having two seconds of animation in the whole thing is unskippable because of the beautiful song. The same goes for Who's Theme which is played at the end of Episode 12. It also goes for all the other endings used at the end of episodes 17, 23, and 26. Even when they aren't produced by Nujabes they all are beautiful to listen to.\
I also need to mention how the show uses its musical soundtrack. Now Samurai Champloo uses its music in very weird places, for example for the first 10 minutes of episode 14 they use a very strange sounding vocal track during the scene. At first it's unsettling but then you realize it's a strangely amazing choice, there are a lot of moments like this is Champloo and never ceases to amaze me. Overall, Samurai Champloo has some of the best music I have heard in an anime to date.\
Verdict:\
Samurai Champloo may not be as good as Cowboy Bebop, but in the end it really doesn't matter at all because of how well directed every aspect of this show is. The music, art, and story direction is really something to be seen, and I think this may now be one of my favorite anime I have ever seen. I can't recommend this show enough, it somehow makes all its flaws obsolete and takes elements of things that shouldn't work and makes it work. If you are interested in film or anime I really think you should watch this show, it is a really good example of great direction. Overall, I give Samurai Champloo a...\

    Samurai Champloo is living proof that a comedy absolutely can have a cast of likable characters and a solid storyline to boot. On top of all that, this show is a contender for having one of the greatest soundtracks in an anime, ever.\
\
Story: 8    **some minor, episodic spoilers within this section**\
What is so fascinating about this show is how that, underneath all the comedic antics and funny situations the group finds themselves in, the show paints a more grim depiction of life during the Edo Period. Though largely revealed by the fact that many of the episodes involve the trio struggling to\
          \
        find food and/or shelter on a day-to-day basis, this theme is much more loudly, and sometimes more seriously, portrayed by the people they cross paths with during their journey. A teenage boy turns to petty thievery to pay for medicine for his mother's worsening ailments. An aspiring artist, struggling to make ends meet, is coerced into painting girls' portraits as a catalog for a human trafficking ring. A woman turns to working at a brothel to pay her husband's gambling debts. Life in the Edo Period is grueling, is what this show is saying. And despite this, Samurai Champloo always leaves you laughing through each episode. The greatest triumph of the show's storytelling is how well it balances comedy and drama. It knows it's a comedy, and provides you with many memorable scenes to laugh at, but has expertly placed moments of sincerity that never feel forced or out of place.\
Beyond this, the show features an overarching storyline, their journey to find the samurai who smells of sunflowers. What begins as a simple tale of three estranged characters romping through Japan, slowly and deliberately evolves into a more character-driven story that forces the trio each to face the ailments of the past, as well as struggles both internally and externally. While not a blockbuster hit, it maintains a solid story with good characterization and a satisfying ending to each character's personal issues and the story overall.\
\
Art: 8\
Samurai Champloo has a very unique style, as it features a period-specific setting with a touch of contemporary nuances. The art style of the characters breath a very distinct breath of individuality in a comedy show featuring samurais and hip hop music. Everything is stylistically and aesthetically pleasing for the most part.\
\
Sound: 10\
Oooooh boy. The music. I distinctly remember the first time I watched this on Adult Swim back in 2005. I was always taught to never judge a book by its cover, but the intro immediately had piqued my interest. Who knew that hip hop instrumentals would fit so perfectly with a Japanese period piece? Featuring tracks from talented artists like Force of Nature, Fat Jon, Tsutchie, and of course, the LEGENDARY Nujabes (if you've never heard of him, I IMPLORE you to listen to Departure, the first soundtrack album for Samurai Champloo), the show's stylistic directions are amplified tremendously, giving Samurai Champloo a great distinction not just as a comedy or a period piece, but as an anime as a whole. The soundtrack is well placed throughout the series, knowing when to allow the dialogue to carry the scene, and when to add flavor and style to the events taking place. Even with people who generally don't like rap or hip hop, I have yet to hear of someone who disliked the show's soundtrack.\
\
Characters: 8\
The show is filled with personality. Not just the three main characters, but nearly everyone they come across in their bizarre journey. People who fulfill their comedic roles very well. People who reveal the grim underbelly of the series' themes. People who serve to expose and challenge the main characters' inner demons. There are barrels of likable fellows in this show, for many different reason. Though I speak very highly of the characters, I give this particular area an 8, mainly because there are a few characters that come off a little flat, and not just for comedic purposes. Overall, Mugen, Jin, and Fuu are well written and internalized throughout the series, which is something unusual to say about a comedy, though I'm certainly not complaining.\
\
Enjoyment: 9\
This show managed to force out of me a handful of belly laughs, while at the same time persuading me to become invested in its characters and caring about their journey's outcome. There is not a single dull episode in this series. I understand it may seem weird to speak so highly of it and not award it a 10, I certainly can't blame you if you think that. It may just be a natural hesitance to award a perfect score, though I can't bring myself call Samurai Champloo a PERFECTLY enjoyable experience. Despite this, I still want to reiterate simply how fun it is to watch this show.\
\
When it comes to anime that I find myself rewatching every now and then, for any given reason, this show is on the top of that list. Samurai Champloo is an excellently crafted anime that deserves to be watched by anyone who loves a good comedic anime. And please, for your own sake, watch it with English dubs.\

    One of the best shounen animes I've ever seen. One word to sum it up: Badass. From the detailed art to the opening/ending themes, it really left me with a strong impression.\
Story: 9.5\
Wonderfully written; balances fighting and other themes while still keeping the viewer's attention. (I would've given it a 10 if it weren't for a 'recap' episode; however, that is my personal preference, and I know that it still fits with the order.)\

    When I was new to the world of anime, of course, like any other excited person, I searched some of the best anime to watch. I saw Samurai Champloo. I was EXTREMELY attracted by the orange coloured poster they attached to the review of this anime. It looked really cool to me. So when I started this anime, I was bubbling with curiosity and excitement. And then I watched a few episodes.\
The story was boring (now what I mean by this is - actionless. Prior to this, I had watched anime like Naruto, Code Geass, FMAB, etc. and so Samurai Champloo seemed SO BORING to\
          \
        me). I was REALLY REALLY hoping for some cool action scenes and especially since it was swordfighting! Ah! What a shame. Nah, the fights were not really good. I've heard people say that the art is really good in the fights. Now, I don't agree or disagree to that. But even if that was the case, the fights are still not good. They just kept walking towards the Sunflower Samurai. Encountering boring things on the way.\
I was actually just wishing I could skip some episodes or something. Anything to get me out of the misery. But then I reached the final 6 or 7 episodes. Now, I started getting into the series a bit. I started liking it. Loved the characters. \
And then I sort of started seeing it in a different light (after I did some googling, i.e.). The anime wasn't meant to be an action-packed series or anything. What was good about it was the portrayals of early Japanese livelihood, culture and progress. It showed different aspects of society and how each grew and developed over time. It excellently shows how Japan changed under the Western influence. It really is awesome.\
At the same time, the anime is filled with the people's own Japanese culture too. It shows how even when things changed, they still kept hold of their roots. \
I started loving Japan the moment I started watching anime. I can say that Samurai Champloo made me love the country more!\
Oh, and the theme music. Need I say more?\

I. Watched. Samurai. Champloo.\
Correction; I was engrossed with it. Every step of the way. \
I cannot describe it other than one of my new favorites for action, story and character. \
The absolutely phenomenal story had me hooked on, and even though most episodes seemed to be a bit loose from each other, seeming like they were only living day to day with the occasional fight...they tie together quite well, all the way up to having me begging for everything to go well at the end. \
The art may not be for everyone, especially the music. I wasn't a fan of the Rap/Pop/Etc music opening,\
          \
        but that ending theme and every other song was quite well. \
The characters...Beautiful. Fuu may be bumbling but she does her job as being one of the main trio, keeping a leash on Jin and Mugen, who are at each other's necks, but with the ending being them having that mutual respect for each other with their last clash rather than both killing each other...I just felt like I couldn't have had a better ending. \
I obviously enjoyed it. There's no other way I can say...this was something I'm glad I binged in 2 days even though I had a slow start. \

    Shinichiro Watanabe, that's the name of the man who directed Samurai Champloo, and the same man that directed Cowboy Bebop. How do follow a series like that? Is Samurai Champloo anywhere near as good, did Watanabe direct another masterpiece? Well, like Bebop I've heard that the dub here was good so I watched it in English. Here's what I thought.\
Story:8/10\
Just like Bebop it follows an episodic narrative design. Although not as consistent as Bebop, there were definitely some awesome episodes. My fav being ep. 23,\"Baseball Blue,\" it's one of the funniest episodes Ive seen in anime. The best part however was its themes, it discussed\
          \
        the culture and problems that occurred at that time such as religion, sex, and food. This caused the story to feel deeper and showed how the writers really cared about what they were tryna do. Plus the fight scenes here was so lit. There were some flaws however, I found a few episodes to be boring and it really dragged parts of the plot and becuz of this it screwed the pacing a bit. The main plot also lacked motivation and backstory as it didn't really make me care for our characters to find this 'Sunflower Samurai.'\
Art:9/10\
Very well done here. The animation is very smooth and very fine to look at, plus the lighting is used extremely well. Like Bebop, the artwork here just has amazing style to it. My fav thing here however is the use of the Edo art, it gave us a unique look at how Japan was at that time as shown in the opening song. The main characters had great character designs but other than them, most of side characters were not very attractive. It does lose a point however for the backgrounds, cuz although they were very detailed there were times where they looked dull. There were also times where the action quality dragged but that was only a few times\
Sound:10/10\
Like Bebop, this was the series' biggest highlight. It has one of my fav Anime soundtracks ever, it's opening theme and ending song are one of the best ever. It consists of hip hop and R&B and although the setting was around the Edo-era, it still matched all the scenes. It was just a perfect choice for the anime's style. As for the dub it was very good. Both Jin and Mugen's VA did a great job on fitting their personalities. Fuu's VA had the right voice but the main problem I had was that she sounded corny at times. But it doesn't matter becuz the dub overall was still great.\
Character:8/10\
Although a good rating, this was the one area that kinda disappointed me. But we do have dope ass characters in Mugen and Jin. These two were an enjoy to watch each given their own unique fighting styles that are completely unmatched. Jin had the best backstory of the cast and it beautifully showed us what gave him his lonely, stoic personality. Fuu to me was good not great. I felt she didn't really have much of a purpose here(other than keeping Mugen and Jin from killin each other)but she was kind hearted and intelligent and what her interesting was the fact she had the biggest appetite of the three. What made this trio entertaining was that most of the series' comical scenes came from when they were all together. Weakness here are the side characters, although some have their moments, most of them are kinda forgettable.\
Final Verdict\
So did Watanabe do it again, the answer is YES. He did a great job on utilizing contemporary music and mixing genres just like in Bebop. Although it ended well imo, this was one anime that I wish was longer cuz I felt it had the stuff to give us much more. Not only is Samurai Champloo great but it's one of the coolest samurai works ever. Like Bebop, when it comes to style there's nothing better than this.\

    Wanna watch some anime that you doesn't know or anti-mainstream? Just watch this. I know this anime comes from my friend in MyAnimeList. I’m ask for recommendation anime what suits with me. Then, he told me this anime. And after finishing it, it’s pretty good to remember that the author also made some popular anime like Cowboy Bebop and Ergo Proxy. When I first heard of the opening entitled “Battle Cry”, the lyrics were really cool and had very deeper lyrics. That’s where I’m interested to watch this anime.\
Although “Samurai Champloo” plot is simple, “Samurai Champloo” features a unique soundtrack and a great character introduction.\
          \
        Typically, samurai-themed anime will present traditional music or Japanese orchestra. But, unlike this anime. This anime presents a blend of samurai and hip-hop. It’s sort of weird and funny when samurai and hip-hop meet. But, that’s what makes this anime so unique. One of them is the transitions of sound effects using disc jockey. Nujabes is one of the musicians who fill this anime soundtrack. Nujabes managed to create a musical composition that brings Jazz and Hip-Hop to perfection. In addition to Nujabes, Fat Jon, Tsutchie, and Force of Nature also fill some of these anime soundtracks as well.\
Little by little, the introduction of his character was introduced gradually. Starting from the tragic story of the three characters to how he became like that. The plot of the story “Samurai Champloo” is deeply neatly tied up because every episode is tucked away by some Plot-Twists that amaze the audience even ending-nor should it be underestimated. “Samurai Champloo” also presents some modern cultural references that have blended with the Japanese lifestyle such as beatbox, rap, graffiti, baseball, and others.\
“Samurai Champloo” has a story and a balanced character that each episode isn’t bored to watch. Starting from the soundtrack to the plot, everything is equally balanced. We can also learn a bit of Japanese culture and history in the Edo period. The anime is also slipped several comedies that make the audience laugh. Samurai Champloo is very suitable to watch by some anime fans and who are not anime fans.\

    Story (10): I really love Japanese history (especially feudal Japanese), and this anime is the right thing for me. I was asociated with this anime from the first episodes. Story is interesting, unusual, sometimes sad, sometimes happy. Simply, i cant find the bad things about the story.\

Fuu is cute, young girl, who's sometimes irritating, but i like her too. Other characters are pretty good too, i've got laugh every time the police detective appear. \
Enjoyment (10): I really enjoyed every of 26 episodes. Every episode is interesting, fullfill with action, history, happiness, and tears sometimes. \
Overall (10): If u love shonen genre, and u want to learn something about Feudal Japanese history, at least, give it try :) i gave it, and i dont regret it :).\

    This was a magnificent show, a true adventure for the both the viewers and characters. For those who have seen this directors other top rated shows, you will know you'll be in for a treat. The show features talented swordsmen who embark on a journey in search for a samurai that not many people have knowledge of. Beautiful animation for the sword fights will for sure get any viewer immersed in the each episode as they battle their way to find this rumored samurai. Also I would like to add that this show has more realistic fight scenes, so no wall runs or standing on\
          \
        water. Which for this show I loved, cause one can only take so much generic shounen action scenes.\
Story:\
So I've heard a few people say this show has no story, and that each episode is filler. I want to say that this show is episodic at times, but the 'filler' is just what they do on their journey. So the story takes place in the Edo period of Japan, so it's all swords and fun from there. When a couple of samurai wonder into a restaurant they stumble across a couple of no good baddies, so the two stir things up into a fight and now the town wants to get rid of them. While the fight goes on a girl who works at the restaurant decides to hire them to help her find a samurai she barely knows anything about. From there the story is about their quest to find the samurai.\
Characters:\
These characters were amazing, they had such a nice background story that I felt attached to the three dearly. All three vary differently, they are an unlikely group that yet fit together so perfectly well. The introductions were nice, as well as appearance and attitude. I know characters are supposed to be distinctive, but this show did that to a nice level. I could write about these wonderful characters all night, but I'd rather keep the review short, so just know that the characters are great.\
Art:\
The style was pretty nice, a good change from the generic look of characters and environment. All characters, side and main, had an amazing design to their appearance as well as attire. The overall appearance were fitting well to match their personality. The audio used for the show was also artistic, for the transitions from scene to scene. There was a nice use of hip hop beats as well as record scratches and the occasional beat box. An impressive sound choice for a wonderful show.\
Overall:\
I enjoyed the show to its fullest, and I'm sad that the story had to end there. The show had me yearning for more, and to me when a show does that it fulfills its job to be a grand show. I loved the show and recommend it to anyone who loves beautiful action scenes and fun characters.\
Pros: Fun show, sit back and relax, good laughs and nice story\
Cons: Some conveniences, you'll notice them.\

    This anime is so overrated IMO\
the plot makes sense with just one target \"find the Samurai that smells like sunflower\", why did Mugen and Jin go with Fuu?? nobody knows...\
Story: the history is very objective: find the samurai. But, the way that was make it is so boring and cliche, and what was that climax? 23 episodes to they go to there, and when they gone, isn't that good...\
Art: Simply beautiful, for a 2004 anime. The fight scenes are pretty good IMO.\
Sound: I personally LOVE chill instrumental musics, so I loved this OST. I'm very happy to have know Nujabes.\
Character: The story resolves around about:\
Fuu:\
          \
        a cliche character, but she's good, the her feeling is so good, she's so positive and funny, for me the best character.\
Mugen: I really don't liked him, he don't have any objective, he's just wants kill someone.\
Jin: The misterious Jin, I like that character type.\
Enjoyment: Samurai Champloo is dividided in GREAT EPISODES and SHIT EPISODES, have so many useless episodes... and so many filosophy episodes with great fight scenes, the development is so slow, and this is bad IMO\
Conclusion: I recommend this anime, but this is not that good as the mostly think xD\

    anime has a way of making you like a show that might now even have a story to it. But to be completely honest, sometimes it is all about the adventure and fun the show represents, so without further a due, from the creator of cowboy bebop, Mr. wtanabe gives us samurai champloo.\
story: 6/10\
The story of samurai champloo is very very very very simple to grasp. Two badass samurai start kicking each other's ass, a girl named Fuu comes along and saves them after being arrested and in return those two don't kill each other until they help her find the samurai that smells of\
          \
        sunflowers. boom, entire story, now why did I give the story a 6/10? Because the story barely exist, the show contains more filler than anything. Normally i'd say that this isn't that big a deal, but they don't make shit progress until the final episodes, and yes those filler episodes are very enjoyable, but my god, the plot needs to exist somewhere, right?! In terms of fun, which is exactly what this show is, it's great, but in terms of story, it kinda flopped in my opinion. But remember, it is still fun to watch, just the main plot itself barely exists.\
art and animation: 10/10\
With a show that had madhouse as it's production company and manglobe for it's animation, there's not really much more to talk about other than it looks fucking awesome. Truly one of the show's highpoints, the action is smooth and the attention to detail, while not perfect, is definitely noticeable. so that wraps up this segment.\
sound: 10/10\
Samurai Champloo truly has one odd yet genius sountrack. You won't find another show with this kind of soundtrack. It has an opening featuring rap, and hip hop beats and some nice soothing music when it wants and needs it, including the ending song done by Shiki no uta, which is an amazing song, just gonna have to trust me on that one. It seems that wantanabe really likes having the music speak for the show itself, being champloo and bebop are his best two pieces of work (in my opinion). Not a bad thing because soundtracks to both shows are awesome. \
Characters: 7/10\
The characters in this show really are the definition of the rule of cool. Mugan is your beatboxing breakdancing samurai, who kicks as much ass as he talks shit, you have Jean, the cool calm relaxed, but deadly samurai who is the exact opposite of Mugan, and you have Fuu.... and she's the only character I couldn't give a shit less about in this show. She literally serves no purpose, she's not there for fanservice, she's not there for comic relief, and she sucks at trying to keep Mugan and Jean from killing each other. in all honesty, Mugan and Jean get very well flushed out and a lot of cool reasons to like them. Fuu just does not have anything on that end, and considering she has a fair amount of dialogue and presence in the show, she became annoying. just a dragggggg.\
enjoyment overall: 7/10\
Samurai Champloo is a very entertaining show and however, it tries a little to hard to be like it's cousin cowboy bebop. It is a show with two awesome samurai's, some seriously epic fight scenes, and a sountrack that will blow the doors off of most shows being the rarity it is. The only real gripes I have with the show is that it couldn't focus on the main plot of the show enough, and while many will say that it's all about the adventure, your right, but you need to get on the plot at some point. and waiting until the last three or so episodes is a bit ridiculous. And of course since Fuu SUCKS, she just dragged the show a bit there too. so I feel a 7/10 is a fair rating for this show, and should be a recommendation to watch it. it's fun, it's entertaining, and hey, just don't go into it accepting a deep plot?\

    Samurai Champloo: Where hip hop culture and kickass samurai sword fighting clashes. Not only is that just as cool as it sounds, it is just one of many aspects that makes this show a true masterpiece!\
In a nutshell, Samurai Champloo follows a young girl named Fuu, accompanied by swordsmen Mugen and Jin, on a epic journey  through Japan´s edo period in search of the samurai who smells of sun flowers. It is basically a road movie that features many things you don´t come across in anime that often.\
After i first watched the show in 2007, it topped my all time favourite anime list and\
          \
        is still very much in my personal Top 5. Here is why: I can´t think of any important aspect that i feel was executed poorly.\
First of all, how the in the beginning somewhat benign overarching  plot slowly builds into something that´s greater than our protagonists journey itself was quite breathtaking to me. In a very clever way, every decision Fuu, Mugen and Jin make has a severe influence on many other people the trio meets along the way.\
Second, the character development is superb. Over the course of the 26 episodes, we get to witness how an extremely naive 15-year old girl develops into a more mature and serious young woman without ever losing her charm and how two samurai who just outright hate each other slowly but surely learn to respect one another by learning more about their pasts.\
Topic Number 3: Creativity. Mixing many different facets of a modern art form like hip hop into the 19th century of Japan is far from easy, but it totally works here. We see rappers, beat boxers and even an entire episode dedicated to graffiti sprayers blended in with the story, and they never feel out of place. Apart from that, it is sometimes hard to tell whether this anime is episodic or not. While the main plot is constantly present, many wonderful side stories are told throughout the show, naturally giving Champloo comedic, romantic, dramatic and even tragic moments, separated from another by badass sword action!\
Last but not least, i wanna talk about the sound. Wow, what a great mixture Champloo´s OST is. As you can probably guess, it is mainly hip hop and features some pretty well known artists like Force of Nature or Nujabes. But even if rap is not for you, you can find some gems on this record. Minmi´s Shiki no Uta is as fitting an ending theme as you will hear, and i especially want to mention  a piece called Obokuri Eemui, a traditional (but slightly modernized) Okinawan folk song played in the background of a very important scene. This song just made me enter a dream world and i instantly fell in love with performer Ikue Asazaki, whose music i still listen to frequently when i want to relax.\
All in all, i can only elevate this show to the Masterpiece ranking for all aforesaid reasons. To me, it is by far Shinichiro Watanabe´s best work. And yes, i do know he directed Cowboy Bebop as well! Enjoy the journey!",

The Art, Music, Characters & Awesome Fight scenes makes it leave a lasting impression on the mind. The starting was with a lot of momentum.\
This anime is a good example of the fact that even the episodes that dont actually move the story forward are an essential part of the journey. The main story line felt a bit lacking. Only thing that i disliked was that end left me a bit unsatisfied. \

    I completed samurai champloo some time back and I found it great.The story is good.It taught me alot about Japanese tradition :P.One thing great about samurai champloo is that it is a mixture of many genres.Some parts were just too funny(like the baseball episode),the fights were totally amazing,it has japanese history etc.  It was also a bit emotional. One thing I didnt like about the anime was the 22th episode of the series.It was a weird episode I couldn't just get.It was a filler just after the best part of the story.Make sure to watch the 23th episode(its also a filler).The characters were also\

        fabulous.So overall its a great anime.\

    Being the huge Cowboy Bebop fanboy I am, I had to check out watanabies other big success, Samurai Champloo. Thankfully, it did not disappoint.\
Story:8/10\
 The story for samurai champloo is a simple one, but it does it's job, and it does it well. The story doesn't move in one singular direction, while they are looking for the sunflower samurai, they go an many small detours in every episode. From zombies, to baseball, to a metting a gay, speed eating, European, samurai champloo takes a very simple and boring concept and makes it fun. Also there is a lot of backstory to the characters in samurai\
          \
        champloo.\
Art:9/10\
 The art in Samurai Champloo is great. The way it's drawn, the backgrounds, and fights (especially in the last episodes) are breathtaking. There is not much to dwell on here so I will just say the art is fantastic.\
Sound:5/10\
 This may be an unpopular opinion, but I was let down by the samurai champloo music. I am not a fan of rap/hip-hop to begin with so the music wasn't for me. However the non hip-hop tracks can range from awful, to very good. It has one of the worst openings ever, but a decent ending. The voice acting is very good though, I would say to watch the dub, I like it more.\
Character:8/10\
 The characters in samurai champloo are all very likable, have a lot of development, have their back stories all explained throughout the show. First our main character, Mugen. He I a very funny badass with a smirky personality, but is a very nice guy. Fuu is another of the main trio. She can be annoying at times, but overall, she is a very nice character. Jin is the last member. He is arguably the strongest, and doesn't have to of any outgoing personality, as he is relatively quiet.\
Enjoyment:10/10\
 I never got bored watching this show. I can't dwell on this to much, but it is one of the most enjoyable anime I've seen.\
Overall:9/10\
Samurai champloo is an amazing show that I think every one should try, especially if you like cowboy bebop.\

    This review only applies for the first 6 episodes of the series, it does not constitute for the overall experience of the anime itself and it will be comprised of what I liked/disliked about the anime and the reason I have had dropped it for.\
The story focuses on a shounen group trifecta, the unnecesarily wild character that will beat everyone in his path, the guy that is calm and collected and is always respectuous & a clutzy girl that follows them around because she needs them. The premise itself is really simple and it's nothing that interesting within of itself. Basically what you'd expect out\
          \
        of shounen generally. The story however is incredibly predictable because the characters are very generic, but is that okay? I mean, it's an action anime, the characters aren't exactly what shines in this type of anime. \
Well, then.\
One thing I did really dislike was the fact that, they are samurai. all the fights are decided by using a blade, you won't escape those fights without cut limbs most of the time, that much is to be expected, the results of the fight should often be bloody and really savage, yet, sometimes when people got slashed, the anime just changes to a still frame while the person screams in pain. Sure, there are people who get cut or slashed or stabbed with a sword and there's some blood here and there, but the action is focuses mostly on how awesome the two main characters are and the fights themselves don't display the brutality that would only be natural to be under this type of fights. But the show has picked the safe approach with its fights. The type of fights that wouldn't remotely gross out anyone watching them, so the casual viewer would be like, fuck yeah. The art style of the show is pretty decent looking, I only wish it was used to display some more realistic sword fights. Also the sound of the show is probably not gonna bother you in any way, but don't expect it to be something I'd listen to outside of the show.\
The characters in the series are very generic. As I've said earlier, the main characters are a shounen trifecta, the three C's, the calm, the clutz & the courageous. Can't fail with that. And the episodic characters you will run into are like this for example: guy who is ugly and got a huge body being able to kill everyone goes rampage, but wait, someone, obviously a young girl, isn't afraid of him. OH NO WHAT IS GONNA HAPPEN NEXT? You can pretty much guess yourself. The characters don't shine in any way. They're just very generic and their genericness makes the series really predictable. Basically none of them stand out and are formulas that have been used since the shounen genre existed. Basically the characters also went on the path of a safe approach. The least likely path to ever come across an interesting & unique character. There was one episode out of the six where a more unexpected type of character was introduced, which was silly and I enjoyed the fact that they have had done that, but giving away details on him would be a spoiler. But generally the overall approach is still as safe as possible which didn't really make them entertaining.\
Personally, the fact that the series was so average and didn't have one single thing I could name its own original idea, pretty much made me drop it. Nothing in these 6 episodes got me invested as everything I've seen in it was something I've seen through other series. You might enjoy Samurai Champloo if you're a person that doesn't watch much anime and is like \"yo look, it's an action anime, yay\". It uses safe formulas that have worked for most other series in its genre, so this show might interest you then. But otherwise, at least from the first 6 episodes, there is nothing that really shines through with an unique perspective and almost everything is done in a safe manner.  If you're really into shounen it could also be a good choice for you since you know more of what to expect and how it all could unfold. But if you're not into shounen, it's a definite no, because the series is very  shounen-ish.\

    Samurai Champloo takes place in the Edo period of Japan and follows the journey of Fuu, Mugen, and Jin as they search for the samurai that smells of sunflower seeds. After Fuu helps them escape from the local magistrate and his minions, Mugen and Jin agree not to kill each other until they have helped her find the samurai. The three travel across Japan, encountering assassins, Germans, and desperate teenagers along the way until the story culminates in fierce battles and acts of camaraderie.\
Samurai Champloo is worth watching for its unique nature alone. Renown for its hip-hop beats which define the mood of the show\
          \
        and even the way in which it is animated (note the record scratch and the way the animation skips), Champloo brings to the anime world something completely novel. The animation itself is a sight to behold, showing attention to detail and realism comparable to Cowboy Bebop and Wolf's Rain. The fight scenes too portray samurai swordplay in a way rarely seen in other shows.\
The premise, while nothing incredibly exciting, is different and immediately appealing; the setting in historical Japan (much of which follows historical facts) and focus on a cross-country journey by two samurai and a humorous girl are elements that you won't find elsewhere. There's plenty of character development through entertaining side stories, the show is of good length, and while there is little suspense overall, each episode should keep your attention. The ending is touching and while I never found myself overly dedicated or emotionally attached to the show, I was sad to see it come to a close.\
Really Samurai Champloo seems to be defined by those last sentiments. More likely than not, you won't find yourself glued to the screen and there is no powerful plot or premise; however, that is what makes the show great. If you want an elaborate plot with terrifying enemies and daring heroes, Samurai Champloo isn't what you're looking for. But if you want a chill story that doesn't waste time but never feels rushed, doesn't feature crazy special effects but never has a dull fight, and doesn't command your attention but still leaves you wanting to watch to the last episode, then give it a try. If you like hip-hop and the elements that it would inspire in an anime, Samurai Champloo is what you want.\

    First off, you need to watch Samurai Champloo.  Not because it's good (it is) or because I promise you'll be convinced by my review (meh), but because this is one of only three anime directed by Shinchiro Watanabe.  The other two, for those that don't know, are Kids on the Slope (this one's brand new and I haven't seen it) and Cowboy Bebop, one of the most critically acclaimed anime ever made.  Cowboy Bebop was so well praised that today you either watch it or people won't really take you seriously on the topic of anime.  The same can arguably be\
          \
        said for Samurai Champloo: you're free to love it, criticize it, or even hate it, but you at least need to see it.\
Even if you could care less what nerdy anime viewers like myself think about you based on your \"watched\" list, Samurai Champloo is worth watching because it's a really fun and enjoyable show.  Much of this is due to the instantly likable trio of Mugen, Jin, and Fu, whose sharply different personalities lead to hilarious interactions.  Mugen is essentially an animal in human form, raised on an island for criminals, who says whatever is on his mind and picks fights with people for the thrill of it.  Even his fighting style is wild, based more on gut-feeling and the surprise of spontaneity than formal training.  Jin is, by contrast, quiet, distinguished (he wears glasses for looks), and concerned for others.  Trained in a dojo from youth, he rose to the top of his class and is now (in)famous for his skills and actions.  Fu is purposefully mysterious, refusing to reveal why she seeks the samurai who smells of sunflowers, but kind at heart and the one who binds the group together.  Each episode (or often two), in Cowboy Bebop fashion, tells a mini-story about the trio's journey and interactions with different people and places.  In one, they participate in an eating contest in Edo and show a gay German (great social commentary) around town while avoiding the police attempting to deport him.  In another, Jin helps a woman who has been forced to work at a brothel to pay off her husband's gambling debts (and cannot divorce him under Japanese law - again, great social commentary) escape to a women's shelter.  \
Overall these mini-stories are pretty entertaining, even though they often fail to develop the characters or story in a meaningful way.  A lot of the episodes can feel like filler and the show lacks much of a hook or sense of suspense.  Consequently, for some viewers Samurai Champloo can be hard to pick up and easy to drop.  I don't fall into that camp, but I understand it and think it has some merit.  If you don't love the characters and the journey, there just isn't much here for you.  I would still recommend the ending (last 3 episodes), which is engaging, plot-driven, and damn good.\
Like Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo probably suffers a bit on the story end due to its perfectionist attitude toward animation and audio.  The animation is not only outstanding - the scenery is exquisite, the character designs are original and attractive, and the fight scenes are meticulously crafted and realistic - it melds seamlessly with the original hip hop soundtrack, from scene cuts to dialogue to battles, such that the entire show is hip hop, and it wouldn't be Samurai Champloo otherwise.  Quality-wise, this OST is one of the very best in anime (feels like an Asian Flying Lotus album and never gets old), right up there with Cowboy Bebop and Wolf's Rain.  (For a sampling, check out \"Just Forget\" and \"You (alternate version)\").  The voice cast is likewise top notch, featuring big names like Liam O'Brien and Kari Wahlgren, and even bit characters have professional-sounding actors.\
More than anything, Samurai Champloo is an amazing concept.  Combining hip hop themes with Edo-period Japan works to create a completely original and beautiful world, an escape from your everyday life and your typical anime premise.  The cast and dialogue is fun to watch and often funny as hell, and the story is generally engaging and creative.  I've seen some tough criticisms of Samurai Champloo, but this is to be expected if you're Watanabe's next big production.  To an extent these criticisms have merit, and I would have liked to see more plot-driven writing, fluid storytelling, and character development.  But even this could only go so far: at heart, Samurai Champloo is about the ride (call it a \"journey\" anime maybe), and you either like those or you don't.",

    This is, in my opinion, one of the best drawn animes out there. It's story isn't outstanding, as it feels more like the first 2-3 episodes and the last 2-3 episodes follows the story. But that's what I like about it. After all, I'm one of those that goes for the art and voices first. I can't stand disproportionate eyes and such, and not for example the voice of Krillin in the DB series.  There's not much more I can say about it, except that it's a MUST WATCH!

    The aesthetics of Samurai Champloo are amazing. The art has a distinct style, and the animation is fluid and just awesome. The soundtrack, also, contributes to what makes Sam Cham special: that nifty fusion of traditional Japanese period and hip-hop. The only way it's a working mix is when the art and the sound are there together, making it, aesthetically, a tour de force.\
Samurai Champloo is a journey story, and because it's a journey story, the plot suffers. Fortunately, the premise is also simple: Mugen and Jin go with Fuu to find her sunflower samurai. Everything that happens from the first episode on is almost\
          \
        pure character development--and what development it is. I'm absolutely taken with how Mugen and Jin change from their initial characterizations of being both crazy and shut off to shaping themselves around each other and Fuu, to becoming used to having friends and belonging somewhere. It works so well because the things that happen to them are both unexpected and exactly what the viewer wants, and that makes Sam Cham a totally enjoyable viewing experience.\

    For those of you who don't know, Samurai Champloo is the successor to Cowboy Bebop. Also directed by Shinichirō Watanabe, Samurai Champloo takes place in the Edo Period, but with a modern twist...\
Story - Like I said before, Samurai Champloo takes place in the Edo Period and involves three main characters: Fuu, Mugen and Jin. I'll go into more detail later on, but Fuu ends up recruiting Mugen and Jin, in order to find the 'Samurai who smells of Sunflowers'. \
Art - The art style used is great to look at. It uses bright colours and representation of foliage and the background scenery, makes it\
          \
        a real treat for your eyes.\
Sound - Featuring soundtracks from Tsutchie, (Watanabe's longtime friend, I might add) FORCE OF NATURE, Fat Jon and Nujabes. Samurai Champloo adds a modern twist to the era of old. Great beats I might add.\
Character - I really like the three main characters Fuu, Mugen and Jin.\
Fuu: She is a 15 year old waitress, has a bright personality and surprisingly enough can eat ALOT for her size.\
Mugen: He is 19 years old, a brash, arrogant and a reckless person most of the time. He has a very unique fighting style that is not common with the traditonal samurai. Also can be a womansier at most times.\
Jin: He is 20 years old, extremely skilled swordsman, mostly keeps to himself, and spent the majority of his life training at kenjutsu dojos.\
These characters bring real variety to the series, these characters are not your typical happy go lucky type. \
Enjoyment - I was looking forward to watching this anime for a while, so of course I really enjoyed watching this anime for the entirety of the 26 episodes.\
Overall - Samurai Champloo is a great series, it has the right amount of blood, good laughable moments and great sword/fighting scenes. Apart from the main storyline of Fuu recruiting Mugen and Jin to search for the 'Samurai who smells of Sunflowers', each episode is an entirely different episode in it's own right, if you get what I am saying. \

    Characters- Mugen is very hot headed, act first, think later, and muscles through authorities, and those who are prepared to die. Jin is his opposite, cool headed, logical thinker, and quiet. Fuu is timid, but not at the cost of seeing others oppressed; she needs both Mugen and Jin to protect her on her journey to find a samurai of sunflowers. If there's anything personality wise these three have in common, it's that their pride, and dignity is worth dying for. Their back story however, is shown through other characters seeking revenge, old friendships etc. (9)\

The three protagonists, interacting with each other, those they meet, and how natural everything plays out; nothing seems forced. This is easily planned by how different the three are, how they're dirt poor, and need information on a samurai they know nothing of. The sad part is, the story could have been over in about 8 episodes, but all the problems they face are ones created by mugen and jin. The quote \"It's not about the end result, but the journey,\" is emphasized in this show greatly. The end result is very anti-climactic, but you don't care about that, and neither do our protagonists. And honest as a beaver, I don't think I'm alone when I say Fuu would have had an easier journey if she never traveled with her \"bodyguards,\" but that's what makes this story brilliant. All that horrible stuff they deal with, the blood, sweat, and anger, is very stressing, yet, they wouldn't have it any other way. To them all that was worth the new found friendship they gained. (9.8)\
Sound- Very amazing. The mixture from Hip-hop, and Japanese sounding music go very well together. All the songs go incredibly well into the event that's taking place. Using only piano on those soft moments, and rapid tempo that would hype up a fight. (8.8)\
Art- Once again, very good. the characters in the show are very clean, and their actions have no choppiness. The backgrounds depict the beauty of the edo period. It's subtle about it, but really makes you want to see it for how it was. Also the backgrounds are sometimes still paintings. (9)\
Enjoyment- Very. I've watched this series 17 times so far, and it doesn't age; it only gets better. (10)\

    Honestly, I can't name any other anime like this one. It's realy uniqe, maybe not all of it, but mostly. Realy beautiful, original art, that can't be seen anywhere else, kinda unforgettable characters, realy interesting stories - this anime is one of my top three animes.\
I started watching it on tv, but in Poland not many of animes are shown, so they aired only few episodes. But I realy liked it, so I googled it and watched the rest. I just wanted to finish what I started, but now Samurai Champloo is one of my favs.\
One of my favourite things about this anime are subtle\
          \
        love stories. Some of them are obvious but kind of romantic and... \"not easy\", I could say, and some of them are... I'm still not sure if it was a real thing, or maybe I am overthinking this :).\
This anime is not for kids, it's realy mature, that is a huge plus. All stories are realy thoughtfull, you can't see any coincidence in any part of any story, it's all realy well put together.\
What can I say more... it's more for guys then girls, but I still loved it, I loved every single fight scene, every dialog, every vew there is... At the beggining I liked it for the art, it's seriously beautiful, but now... all I think about are main characters and their stories. I would realy enjoy another season...\

    Samurai Champloo is b-b-b-b-badass lol....yeah sorry...\
But seriously, this story is just amazing. The characters Jin and Mugen are complete opposites, yet equally as awesome! Fuu eh well at least she wasn't incredibly annoying, trust me it could have gone a lot worse. Needless to say the characters are diverse, and it's cool to see them interact the way they do. Two amazing swordsmen make a promise to a whiny girl, and instead of chopping her to bits, they keep their word. That makes them more likeable characters, you want them to be good. \
I do have one gripe, and yes it is a SPOILER\
let me\

for those of you who are hard of seeing S-P-O-I-L-E-R\
                                   !!!!!!!!!SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!\
I was watching the whole show non-stop with my cousin, you kicken back playing Yu-gi-oh, and having nerf sword duels... good stuff.\
Anyways at the end i just wanted Jin to die, I mean cmon...\
He's my favorite character, but cmon the man took a sword to the chest!\
But i digress....\

    Samurai Champloo is an anime that I came across very skeptical since the person who recommended it to me didn't know how to put in words what this series is, and I can't blame him for that actually. Samurai Champloo is a very original concept of samurai shonen that mixes elements of hip-hop culture (is that a culture really?). \
Story 8/10 The story is about 2 swordsmen, one a true samurai master, the other an unorthodox genius, after getting in a short fight, they end up having a debt with a young girl who convince them to join her in a journey for which they\
          \
        only have minor clues.\
Art 10/10 awesome design of the characters and sceneries, great fight sequences, great color choice, no complains.\
Sound 9/10 as in Cowboy Bebop, music plays a great role, this ost is a bit more exotic , I just wasn't amuse by it 100% of the time, still it was great and great variety. RIP Nujabes\
Character 8/10 this isn't the kind of series you'll get a full insight of your protagonists, there's development, still it takes some time to empathize with the characters.\
Enjoyment 8/10 as it has an episodic format, you'll find some randomness if you watch a marathon, in terms of continuity. Anachronism everybody mentions basically refers to the fact they modify some historical events for them to fit in our protagonist story and time, as there will be events from Japanese Edo age, there'll be as well reference to hip-hop urban culture at the same time.\
Overall I give this a 9, I would recommend if you're searching for something fresh, different, some real action and samurai violence as well to be open for jokes, plot twists and ambiguous stories, also Cowboy Bebop fans.\

    Samurai Champloo had to has to have been hands down the best anime of all time in my opinion. The artwork was fresh, characters - memorable, music - new. In my eyes, this anime completely surmounted Cowboy Bebop (and I say this very hesitantly because I know there are many Bebop faithfuls out there), but their journey was amazing. There was the right amount of humor provided by Mugen, a perfect foil to Jin's serious attitude. Fuu provided a touch of femininity that balanced out both of the macho presences. I truly felt as if I embarked on the journey with all three characters and\
          \
        was involved in their escapades. While another sequel may never happen, I would love another show by this same director similar to Bebop and Champloo. There is no shortage of top-notch samurai action in the plot, even infused with breakdancing. There is something for everyone in this anime, perfect for first time watchers, and seasoned watchers alike.\

    It’s just like Fuu said. I never wanted the journey to end.\
\
Assuming you’ve read the synopsis, yes, Samurai Champloo is a samurai show with hip-hop undertones mixed with parallelism and satire of the modern world. The beginning was kinda meh and forced myself to watch it to understand the hype and the ending was kinda wonky as expected of its very thin and forced \"main\" story line but the middle part was some of the best anime I've seen. The random episodes where the trio went off on a tangent to go on an adventure, full of action and comedy, was awesome and Champloo at\
          \
        its best. The mini two episodes arcs were epic. And some of the comedy episodes made me lol of how unexpectedly funny it was.  The story premise is to look for a “samurai who smells of sunflowers” but never really focuses on that until the very end. The real main story is the adventure of the three main characters: Mugen, Fuu, and Jin. I won’t reveal anything about them since they need to be experienced firsthand. Some say they’re one-dimensional and don’t grow out of their stereotypes but who really cares about that stuff when you’re so engrossed in their actions. I watched this show and realized I didn’t care at all about the hip-hop music or the sunflower samurai story but rather the characters’ journey.  It left me wanting more episodes depicting their journey through Edo period Japan. There is an underlying subtext story of how the past doesn’t judge you as a person and the journey is more important than the end result. A 10/10 for its soundtrack (RIP Nujabes), its amazing, relaxing ending themes, and glorious animation. Its not a full on parody a la Gintama but not also super serious like Code Geass, fate/zero, or Attack on Titan to name a few. You would be doing yourself a great disservice by not watching this show dubbed. Seriously the dub is amazing plus the original Japanese kinda throws me off hearing One Piece Zoro as Mugen. This show does get a lack of slack for being compared to Cowboy Bebop and it not being as good or “artistic” but if you take it by itself and not compare like a reasonable person, you will find Champloo is still a great anime to watch. If all else, it’s better than what comes out these days with the overpopulation of harem-fanservice-slice of life shows that dominate the market.  The middle part to me is the textbook example of episodic anime and I would highly recommend to anyone who wants a balls-out entertaining and fun show to waste time on.",

    One of the best aspects of this anime is its personal theme of freedom. In one episode of the anime the character Mugen states \"I don't wanna be the ruler or the ruled. I believe in me and what I can do.\" Most people think of freedom as being able to do whatever you want, but this anime shows there's much more to freedom than this. \
Freedom also means being free from things such as religious persecution, racism, homophobia, ableism (prejudice against those with disabilities), senseless violence, and so on. Then there is being free from personal demons. \
Many secondary characters in this anime deal\
          \
        with one of the former, while the main characters deal with the latter. Through the main characters, the anime also does a good job of showing how society's problems can create different personal problems for individuals. \
Speaking of the main characters, each has their own merits. Mugen has women and drinking as his vices as well as a shady past, but he has a cool fighting style based on break dancing and samarai sword fighting and a nice personal style that is reminiscent of hip-hop culture. He has the most striking character development as he confronts his past and learns to care about more than just fighting. \
At first, Jin is the stoic and deadly samurai that most people expect samurai to be. He has movng character development similar to Mugen, except with a tiny bit more humor. Finally, Fuu is a naive yet compassionate and clever girl. Although I wish she could have learned self-defense, her character development is just as touching as Mugen and Jin's, especially as she meets certain people and confronts her past.\
Another great aspect of the anime is how it blends past and future cultures together to show oppressive authorities and dire personal circumstances result in cultural movements. The future culture of hip-hop (i.e. graffiti, break dancing, rapping) into the past culture of the Japanese samurais is a very creative feat shown through secondary characters the viewer encounters and through the main character Mugen. There is another notable blend in one episode involving break dancing, samurai fighting styles, a certain sport, and two countries, but you'll have to watch to see what I mean.\
Final notable aspects of the anime include the soundtrack and the animation. The soundtrack is a blend of hip-hop and traditional Japanese music and another example of the past and future culture blending mentioned earlier. The animation seems to be inspired by traditional Japanese drawings and paintings and is very well done, but there are a couple times it gets a weird modern psychedelic tinge.\
The only flaw is one episode that seemed totally out of place with the others. It had to be the weirdest filler episode I have ever seen. \
In spite of a little bit of weirdness, this was a fantastic anime. I recommend it to those who enjoy action-adventure samurai animes and anyone who enjoys hip-hop culture. I wouldn't recommend this to younger audiences due to the strong violence, drug and alcohol use, and sexual situations.\

    This is my first review here so please bare with me.\
Samurai Champloo is a one of a kind gem.\
Story 10/10\
Samurai Champloo is about the amazing journey of Mugen, Jin and Fuu to find the samurai who smells of sunflowers.But it doesn't end just there.Along the way they face different problems which, they need to solve.Thare are different events in the anime from a graffiti battle to an epic baseball game.You're in for a hell of a journey.\
Art 9/10\
The art is just amazing for such an old anime.Characters are drawn with a style that fits the Samurai Era.The landscapes and structures are amazingly well drawn as\
          \
        well.The only downside was that some minor characters's art style was kinda weird.\
Sound 10/10\
This is where the anime shines the most.If you're a fan of hip-hop and rap music, then you'll definitely love Samurai Champloo's soundtrack.Every single track fits the scenes they are played in.From intense battle tracks to relaxing and cool tracks.But it doesn't end here just yet.There are also heartwarming tracks which are played during emotional scenes.The fighting sounds are also amazing.The sword attacks sound so realistic, and so do other weapons such as guns,scythes and spears.\
Characters 10/10\
This is also one of the strongest aspects of the anime.\
Jin is a calm and quiet type kind of guy, who is intelligent and looks like what you expect from a samurai.He is also extremely strong in kenjutsu. During battles he always keeps his cool and always fights with honor.\
Mugen on the other hand is the complete opposite of Jin. He doesn't know restraint and his recklessness knows no bounds.Unlike Jin, Mugen style of the sword is messy, but that doesn't stop him from being one of the most badass samurai ever in anime.He also doesn't obey the orders of anyone. Mugen only seeks battles with strong opponents.\
Fuu is the girl that formed the team.She is very determined and doesn't let anything stop her from achieving her goal. She is also a monster when it comes to eating.\
There are also many other interesting characters in the series with their own stories and reasons.\
Enjoyment 10/10\
The action in Samurai Champloo is one of the best I've seen. Sword fights are so realistic, that you'll want to see more and more of it.The atmosphere is also extraordinary, because who doesn't love Japan during its Samurai Era ?\
Even though the ending didn't satisfy some people, it most certainly satisfied me.Samurai Champloo is at it's best balancing the comedy and the seriousness in the anime.\
Overall Rate 9.5/10 \
Final Comments\
I highly recommend this anime to people who love samurai and who love the action genre as a whole. I guarantee you, you won't be disappointed!\
I also recommend watching the English Dub version of the anime, since characters sound better than in the Japanese Dub version.\

    You know, back in the days of the early 2000s, I, like most other people, didn’t know much about the world of anime or even if what we were watching was anime at all and then came the world of Toonami and Adult Swim action, both which still exists to this very day. The block (along with other channels like Sci-Fi) was practically our gateway into anime, although it’s mostly action anime but that’s practically what attracts people into it, at least for the TV crowd.\
There is another factor in this and the factor’s name happens to be…..Shinichiro Watanabe, the man known for directing one\
          \
        of the most popular anime (you should know what it is already. If not, it’s Cowboy Bebop) to ever come out in the last 15 years and now he’s trying something different in his genre-mixing project. Like he did with space operas and jazz, this is samurai era and hip-hop. The show blends historical Edo period backdrops with modern styles and references and relies on factual events of Edo-era Japan, such as the Shimabara Rebellion, Dutch exclusivity in an era in which an edict restricted Japanese foreign relations, Ukiyo-e paintings, and fictionalized versions of real-life Edo personalities like Mariya Enshirou and Miyamoto Musashi. The exact placement within world history is questionable, however, and is likely somewhat distorted by artistic license.\
Mugen is a fierce animal-like warrior with a unique Bboying (break-dance) inspired fighting style. Jin has a more traditional style but don’t think of this as a weakness because his skills are amazing. The two contrasting samurai warriors are far from friends, yet their separate paths seem to cross anyways. Mugen is wandering aimlessly through the city when he stumbles upon a teahouse where he meets Jin and Fuu (A ditzy waitress, but don‘t think she doesn‘t have anything hidden up her sleeves). Fuu convinces them both to come with her in search of a mysterious samurai that smells like sunflowers and their journey begins. This modernized hip-hop tale breaks the barriers of the common, historical, samurai anime.\
This is no question when I say that I really, really love this show and I favor it to be one of the my beloved classics (I get to that later) but that’s just me and I have talk about this before via D.R.E.A.M.cast Episode 16 but I felt like I forgot to mention a few things on there and plus, it was my debut so I was bound to fuck up a few times but nevertheless. What makes the show works for me is that sometimes style over substance can work in the right hands and Watanabe is definitely the person with the right hands to do it. I know that style is more flash and spectacle and it skimps on the story but to be honest, it just mostly them finding this guy and it’s not really that deep or complex, but it isn’t time-wasting as during the journey, they encounter with some very shady and dangerous characters and sometimes even some innocent or misunderstood characters, and that especially goes to every main character’s past life and see how they went through hell in their lives and you figure that it’s going to be with you for the rest of your life.\
I’m only going to talk about the main three characters, mostly considering there is a lot of supporting or side characters throughout the series and there are too many to name but I might mention some of them during here. Mugen is definitely one of my favorite characters in the show as the guy is like a bombastic fighting ball that can’t be controlled by one man and I really admire the fighting style of break-dancing and capoeira. He is the anti-hero who simply doesn’t give a fuck about anyone or anything but his own. Hell, I’m not even sure to call him an anti-hero but he’s basically somebody who you don’t want to cross. I also notice in episode 13 and 14, that the rivalry between Mugen and this pirate captain named Mukuro really reminds of Spike Spiegel vs. Vicious in Cowboy Bebop and often those themes about the past coming back to haunt you heavily applies to these two episodes. Now, with Jin, he is more of the traditional samurai and I did admit he was a boring character with a typical past about him and what happened with his master but now that I think about it, he’s not really a boring character, just not as interesting as Mugen.\
I admit, the stealth stance of Jin is what I like about him and him being quiet, that’s actually more threatening than someone who talks a lot of shit. But, whoever, the last main character of the show is definitely my least favorite and that is Fuu, the waitress who’s persuading them to find the samurai who smells of sunflowers and……well, let’s see……she often yells and berates them for trying to kill each other (which I understand), always gets kidnapped, thus is the main damsel-in-distress of the show and what’s really annoying about her is that when every time a woman flirts with Mugen or Jin or vice versa, she gets jealous even though she said she has no romantic intentions between them, i.e., “Why do they want to hang around those women when they got me?” That line just bugs the hell out of me. It’s obvious she wants one of them (well, mostly Jin) but…..who know what? I’m going to get off this subject and talk about the best thing about this show.\
THE MUSIC!!!!!!! Now for most people you don’t much about me, I am a hip hop fan and the minute I heard the theme song playing, I was hooked by it. The music not only deliver but it compliments and helps the style of the anime and often it’s more of the unique scores all there, all done by 4 Japanese Hip Hop producers…..well, 3 and one American producer and they are tsutchie, Fat Jon (from the group Five Deez), FORCE OF NATURE, and of course, Nujabes. “Battlecry” by Nujabes and Shing02 is that one song in an anime that I will never, ever, ever skip while watching this. Listening to the song just get me ready for any episode of the series (well, except for that zombie episode. What the hell was that needed?) and the ending songs cool me down after watching it and I would suggest not only give the soundtracks a listen but give these artists a listen, especially Nujabes. Hell, if it weren’t for Interstella 5555, I wouldn’t be a Daft Punk fan. \
The animation for the show is from Manglobe and this is one of their first efforts into making their own anime, as like Studio BONES, they consist of people who previously worked with Sunrise and the animation is rather alright in this. It isn’t actually a visual marvel but for the fight scenes, they were worthwhile watching and sometimes they worked with what budget they got and all there is some hiccups, this is one of their fairer works.\
Now this is usually the time where I say about what I thought about the dub or sub……see both of them. That’s right. Either way, the show is pretty damn good in any language but if I need to speak about the English dub from Geneon / Bang Zoom Entertainment is that the performances from Steve Blum, Kirk Thornton, and Kari Wahlgren were very excellent, like these roles were hand-crafted made for them, considering Mugen is like a spiritual successor (or predecessor in-universe, since the time is pre-Bebop) to Spike Spiegel and Blum naturally fits into that role.\
FINAL VERDICT: I think for every anime fan and non-anime fan, this is definitely one of those shows that I highly recommended for those who want to see it. Hell, I suggest you own the series on DVD and/or Blu-ray and while some things about it may turn you off or might annoy you (Fuu, the zombie episode, mostly the ending) but it doesn’t ruin the experience of the show itself.\

    This show started off strong, and I had high hopes for it after the first couple episodes; the fighting was smooth and stylized, the characters, sounds and environments seemed appropriate, the only flaw was how the main cast got together, and that was forgivable though awkward. This style carried on throughout most of the series, but the last several episodes really ruined the show; It felt like they had a great story, but no real idea how to write an ending.\
The show went from pushing realism to extreme cases to fully supernatural feats the likes of which should only be seen in shows like Bleach\
          \
        and the anime sin of 'Love and Friendship conquers all'. Many people have compared it to Cowboy Bebop and I'd say that was accurate for a long time. Each episode was basically its own tale, and pretty well done while still adhering to the idea that there was a larger goal.\
The first half of the series, and then some, I'd have given an 8/10 easily. But everything fell apart so horribly as they ended their journey that I actually regretted watching it by the end and if that's all I knew of the show, it may have been a 3/10 for cliches, nonsense and sheer ridiculousness of the situations and interactions. \

    Samurai Champloo is my favorite Shinichiro Watanabe show, and thats because they had luck. But step by step.\
Watanabe show's like Champloo, Bebop or Space Dandy have something in common: their setup. It's always a group of characters who travel from place to place, looking for money while being hungry. And they use this setup to tell short stories in the length of 1 or 2 episodes. And personally I have 2 problems with this kind of structure: 1. To tell these short stories you introduce always some side characters who will get alot of weight in the show. That can feel to me like like\
          \
        a kind of waste. All these side characters get a lot of attention while the main characters loose some and can leave them a little blank. 2. It's a gamble. With always new characters and stories it always changes it's themes. So there are episodes you will like and episodes that bore you to hell.\
And that's what I meant when I said they had luck. There still some episodes that I don't like but there are a buttload of other epiodes that I really enjoyed. And I think this is one of the main reasons why I enjoyed this show so much.\
But I won't leave this review without one reason to distinguish Samurai Champloo from Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy: It's setting. As dumb as it could sound, I really think this is the other main reason why I like this show so much. With the Sci-Fi settings from Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy Watanabe could and will go out really crazy sometimes wih the stories he's able to tell. In Cowboy Bebop the characters meet some strange things and gain some kind of experience from it, and most of the time I couldn't understand the point of the episode. That's where Bebop lost me often. Similar thing in Space Dandy: The episodes could get so weird, even reach Evangelion levels, that it totally lost me (although Season 2 from Space Dandy managed these things better ). Well, and now in Samurai Champloo we have (mostly) a normal samurai setting which forces Watanabe to settle things a little down, and I f*cking loved that. Points were clearer made and stories were far more comprehensible for me. Better said; This series fit much more my taste than the other Watanabe shows.\
And what shouldn't be left out: animation and character deisgn. 2 of our main protagonists have a really awesome appearence and everything on them (clothes, colors, fight style) tells us how diffrent they are. Also the fight scenes are splendid directed and are always top notch animated.\
For short: Samurai Champloo is enjoyable as hell.\

    Ah, the days of staying up past midnight to watch your one favorite anime on Toonami or Adult Swim that you would rather risk getting the smackdown from your parents than miss an episode {even if it was a rerun}… Usually your television program in shining armor would come to rescue you at a time when you just couldn’t take all of the filler TV-14 cartoons and anime anymore and you almost drift off to sleep at some hour in the morning you couldn’t wrap your little head around.\
 But the anime you battled at level 12:30 am were unforgettable…\
 The last of my weekly\
          \
        midnight escapades ended with a FullMetal Alchemist fandom. I battled my fair share of “lower-ranked” anime, however many of them have stuck with me to this day. Samurai Champloo being one of them. Back then, I really didn’t understand much, but if I couldn’t be completely conscious of everything that was going on, I knew it was OK to go to bed, that FMA was over, once I heard the opening song to this anime, plus I thought smelling like sunflowers was pretty cool… years after I stopped watching Adult Swim regularly, I read the manga for this series, then MANY years after that, I used this new-fangled Netflix to watch the whole series again. Please note that I watched all 20-something episodes a couple months ago now, so my recollection may not be pristine.\
Story: 7/10\
The anime is listed as “episodic,” however, it gives the main goal of finding the “Samurai who Smells of Sunflowers.” That being said, one would think that Samurai Champloo would be more of a plot-full anime than an episodic one. Unfortunately not so. However, most of the episodes were not useless. They pushed along character development, or hinted at the ultimate goal. I think that there could have been more plot to make Samurai Champloo more of an elaborate series, add a dash more of character development, tie that in, and we’ve got ourselves gold.\
 I believe that the story lacked in plot advancement. In the last three episodes, the story picked up, moved quickly, and then concluded. That’s not a TERRIBLE thing until you look at the episode count being over 13, because, let’s face it, if the plot isn’t intricate and doesn’t need the relative amount of episodes it takes to tell the story, the episodes in between could be considered a waste of time.\
Animation: 6/10\
There were a couple things harming Samurai Champloo in the way of animation; detail isn’t prominent, and bits of the animation just looked BAD – faces were sometimes disfigured, bodies sometimes not anatomically or proportionally correct. And I think I’ve found some features just missing on occasion.\
However, I do give credit that the action scenes were animated well, along with the opening and ending sequences. Artistically speaking, a lot of the colors of the towns, what supporting characters wore, and environment supported the tone of different scenes, which is icing on the cake. Plus, remixy scene transitions were pretty neat.\
Sound: 10/10\
Watching this on Toonami, you only got to hear English dub voices. I dipped my toe to test the English dub waters upon watching this again, and before I knew it, I was cannonballing in. No character voice is bad, the casting is done very well. The sound effects were pristine, down to characters padding along on tatami mats and splashing in the mud.\
What I REALLY want to talk about is the soundtrack. I believe this is the first time I’m mentioning my iPod. I don’t put many video game or anime soundtracks on myPod unless I deem them worthy enough. Samurai Champloo’s made it. Think Adult Swim’s blurb segments, but with a little more hip-hop. I’m sure this is what the cool kids in the breakdance club listen to. Yes, a lot of the songs come from the same bass/snare line, but it’s the addition of classical instruments and filters that do it for me.\
Characters: 7/10\
I have mixed feelings about the characters. Some of the supporting characters had neat designs, but the main cast wasn’t anything fantastic. Not bad, nonetheless. I would imagine that characters who acted like Fuu, Jin, and Mugen did would wear what they were made to.\
While I liked the characters, I thought that there could have been a bit more depth to them. I feel you barely skim the surface of Mugen and Jin, and Fuu was the main focus though she wasn’t THE main character. We never get why the two guys stick with Fuu to look for the samurai who smells of sunflowers, or why they stop fighting. I’m also not sure how I take the characters seeming like they’re changing through the anime, but the last note was sung as if all of the characters just go back to normal.\
Even though I feel like the character tropes being mashed together is near cliché, doesn’t mean that it’s a fun time and that I don’t like it. They made for some actual comedic moments.\
Overall: 7.8/10\
Samurai Champloo could definitely be perfected in many areas, but it doesn’t mean it’s a bad anime, it had many positives hidden within. The music and lulz were what kept me going. I liked the characters, and even though the story isn’t exactly suspenseful, I was curious about the ending of it. However, for someone who is looking for a grand, exciting adventure, don’t expect much.\
Melodux’s Musings: “You didn’t score this anime very high, why do you seem to like it so much?” I would hate to put all the weight on music, but I do believe that could be it. Music is so sewn in to Samurai Champloo {in some cases more than “music” anime}, that it’s everywhere. The setting is in an alternate edo-era Japan, where hip-hop culture is very prevalent, and you can see it in some “non-traditional” attire and actions. It’s a little hard to explain, and is better shown. But with the music being so good, and having it everywhere, I think that it’s something Samurai Champloo has unique to itself and it’s an anime I wouldn’t pass up.\

    Why I would recommend to someone Samurai Champloo? And how would I describe Samurai Champloo to someone. That's a good question, so I'll just write down my honest oppinion and the reasons why would you start watching these series. I'll try shorten it a little, being my first review on Anime list.\
Firstly, lots of people(not everybody) would pass by without giving much attention to the anime while classifying it 'Old'. I know 2004 isn't really new, at all. But there's something I shall ask you before moving on, Do you all like Death Note; One Piece; Naruto? ..Yes? But aren't they old?\
Firstly, Let's go for\
          \
        the story which has imbued countless, countless aspects(starting from Romance,Comedy, Drama and much more)that definitely makes this really enjoyable for everyone, no matter what age you have.\
I wouldn't go any further into detail, I'd like you discover this masterpiece by yourselves, and please..do not judge everything after the first episode.\
The art, despite being an rather old anime I'd personally say the art is outstanding. I mean, I personally like the art from that point more than the actual one. (My oppinion)\
Im pretty sure you're going to love the characters, the theme songs, the amazing swordplays - Yes, I humble admit that I've never seen more organized swordplays than this anime anywhere - The sad moments, the fun moments, the romantic moments, the tensioned ones! You can never find anything like this, imbued into such small number of episodes, the unique story plot makes them fit perfectly in the end making you that satisfy sigh.\
In the end, I cannot say anything more, It's up to you whether watch it or not. But trust me, its not a wise decision not watching it. I think this, truly represents the milestone of samurai anime. There's never been something similar to this and nor will, I think its in a league of its own.\
I'd like to apologize for grammar/ spelling errors hence english isn't my first language. \

    JUST completed this series right at this moment, and had to immediately post my personal opinion. From start to finish I got felt I had a really good run with the storyline. The theme of &ldquo;Champloo&rdquo; (mix) between the traditional samurai: Jin and the not-so traditional: Mugen added a sweet flavor to the overall arc of the series and continually grabbed my attention with their differences of opinions in certain situations they encounter, while the third character Fuu, seems to represent a medium amongst the two. I would say it&rsquo;s hard for me to say that &ldquo;Samurai Champloo&rdquo; would surpass it&rsquo;s predecessor &ldquo;Cowboy Bebop&rdquo; due\
          \
        to a difference in personal preference. Both series run a different flavor, one is alongside that of a Science Fiction, while the other a more grounded, historical feature of Japanese culture. So I would not say that one is better than the other just due to the fact that they both have their own unique styles and it would be hard for me to bluntly give a judgement. I find it interesting how Bebop was produced back in 98 yet soars it&rsquo;s setting way past it&rsquo;s years, while Champloo produced more recently pushes it&rsquo;s time period backwards. The action sequences in Champloo echoes much of the same style and movements of Bebop which I favored a lot and the hip-hop style music selected to run along the actions of the characters seemed so out of the ordinary yet it fit along so well so the soundtrack had succeeded it&rsquo;s goal. The replay value is high for me because I would like to re-analyze the series again as it&rsquo;s efforts are definitely worth it.\

    There was something about this anime that had me continuing to watch episode after episode, despite the story on its own not sounding too impressive and the ridiculous characters. If somebody asked me to give it a gut-reaction rating out of ten, I'd say eight. However, there are other \"8\" animes that I wouldn't describe as being as great, so this gets a 9 from me out of personal bias. Your mileage can vary. \
_| Summary |_\
Samurai Champloo is a comedic historical fiction (informal categorizing), with some surprising commentary on the times. A lot of the humor is in the anachronisms--not all of which are\
          \
        easy to catch--as well as the ridiculousness of the characters. The story itself is a typicalstory of an unlikely trio (sound familiar?) on a journey to find someone. Half of the anime is spent heavily implying that they will split apart, leaving you wondering if they actually will. While the story is incredibly basic, it's the suspense from episode to episode and the very real desire to know if they ever reach their goal that keeps you going. \
_| Story (7/10) |_\
Let's be honest, if I were to give a person who had not seen the show a summary of the plot itself, they would find it lackluster, shallow and without merit. It's incredibly simple. The thing is, the writing itself is probably a 9/10. It's clever, intentional and often very rewarding from episode to episode. The main plot isn't the point, rather, it's a vessel the writer uses to bring us on an emotional journey. \
 Samurai Champloo's achievement is how intrigued it keeps you from episode to episode. There is a healthy balance of suspense, doubt, and even comedy to keep you going. It avoids many of cliches (not all of them) and leaves you truly wondering what is going to happen. There are a couple of really bad episodes, but the number of total plot holes is relatively low. I commend this anime for keeping a very specific goal in mind and sticking to it, rather than trying to have a huge scope and failing to meet expectations (not every anime can be Fullmetal Alchemist).  \
_| Characters (8/10) |_ \
 The characters in this show are unique in their ability to shine through despite being technically flat. There isn't a lot of detail put into their personalities, and the show never spends a long time working on back-story or deep emotional insights as to why-they-are-the-way-they-are. However, they feel fresh, avoiding many of the stereotypes frequently exhausted in anime. Fuu (main character) is perfectly normal without being inept or overly talented in her areas of life. Mugen and Jin (the other two protagonists) show two very different, radical lifestyles. One is a well educated and intelligent lordless samurai, and the other is a brutish outlaw who never really thinks before doing anything.\
 I would almost be inclined to give them a seven instead of an eight, but they are so integral to the show that rating them on depth alone doesn't seem fair. It isn't about their depth (what I would generally base my character rating on), it's how they interact with the world around them. They manage to never fall into tropes, and while some of the anime was predictable, these characters took a life of their own and weren't always so easy to follow. \
_ | Art (8/10) |_\
While the visuals themselves aren't particularly memorable, it's the animation that catches my eye. The movements are very unique--stylistic--and the artist doesn't skimp out during fight scenes. Motion is fluid and interesting to watch. Mugen's fights using a break-dance style are particularly entertaining. I can't remember any still-frame battles that occurred (something I find common in anime, especially back when this came out). The world itself is refreshing, yet simplistic; it doesn't try to overwhelm you with crazy visuals or scenery but still manages to draw you in. There is an above average level of detail in the world itself, which gets props from me.\
_| Sound (7/10) |_\
It doesn't offend, and is often enjoyable, but I never found myself \"wowed\" by the soundtrack.\
_| Enjoyment (10/10) |_ \
It's extremely entertaining to watch. It's funny. I found myself eye-rolling at quite a few parts but still kept coming back for more. it doesn't linger for too long on one theme or plot element. Overall, very entertaining for me. I loved it and will definitely be watching it again.\
_| The Bad |_\
To be honest, I found the ending to be inconsistent with the flow of the show itself. It seemed as though it was more committed to being different than it was to being particularly good. There is a lot of suspense, but that suspense feels artificial when viewed with a critical eye, and what happens after all is said and done is disappointing. Some have found the ending to be perfect, but I did not. There were a few episodes that contained information which was never referenced throughout the rest of the anime, leading to a few continuity issues. \
 The first half of the anime suffers from a lack of character development. A thought I had repeatedly was \"after all this time, you'd think there was some sort of development on the friendship front.\" This anime is definitely not for people who rely heavily on character relationships, as all three main characters never directly express their emotions. It never satisfies your desire to see closure, and a lot of developments made are left behind in the end. These are some pretty serious flaws, but I decided in the end to keep with the high score solely because it is an anime I don't think I'll ever forget.  \
_| Overall (9/10) |_\
Samurai Champloo will either click with you or it won't. If it doesn't, I would call it a 7-8/10 rather than my 9. \

Just finished Samurai Champloo, and I was plesantly suprised. I am now officially a fan. You are missing out if you havent seen it yet !.\
It's characters have substance, they stand out. Characters get 10/10\
It deserves the label COOL. It's style is very uniqe and clever. \
Style gets 10/10\
I would say the humor is clever too and suprising at some times. \
Humor gets 8/10\
The animation is great, and sometimes simlpy beautiful. \
Animation gets 10/10\
The music ranges from trip-hop, japanese hip-hop, chillout and traditional japanese music like the work of Ikue Asazaki. And it really works well. Soundtrack gets 10/10\
The editing is also uniqe, and\
          \
        in my view elevate the series.\
This series is close to being a 10. What brings it down a bit is the story. The story is fun and entertaining, but havent any depth, But then again it dosnt really need to. Everything is just so dam cool.\
Thumbs up !!\

    Samurai style with hip-hop is an original classic Japanese thing. Truthfully, there was a sentimental feeling while listening to Nujabes melodies and watching the story unravel itself throughout the life of the journey. There were memorable moments and cliffhangers and aren't able to be shown in the anime. Through it all, the fighting scenes in the battlefield, the character understanding, and the fate that brought the trio together are more than just a coincidence. Through the travels, there were moments where it was fun and exciting, there was also sadness and memories characters ran way and didn't plan to face it. The dope music left\
          \
        a huge first impression on the way the emotions and setting fit well with the plot. Although it was only 25 episodes, it was absolutely amazing. I didn't really plan to watch this, thinking it would only be a samurai fighting thing without a story, turns out I wasn't entirely right. The story served it's purpose well, and it was wrapped up in most sentimental ending.\

    First off let me just say that this is one of my favorite anime of all time.  The action awesome, not like your typical Naruto or Bleach fights where the people fighting must tell their life story and philosophy of life before finishing each other off.  Here they fight to the death and winner takes all.  I loved the characters and their relationships to each other.  Mugen the reckless street sword fighter vs Jin the silent samurai and then Fuu the somewhat oblivious girlthrown in between the two.  Another thing to add.  This anime is funny as all hell,\
          \
        one of the funniest ones I've ever seen.  Despite its portrayal of the world where corruption and violence are the only higher powers.  If you liked Cowboy Bebop you will love this.  I highly recommend this anime to anyone who loves anime.\

The Story is great, started laughing when I was watching it. but had big role going to point A to point B, so the episodes are great from my opinion wanted to know what going to happen at the end of this series.i  \
The art was awesome, I really like how it was work on. the bad ass look on everyone. maybe its just me\
The music I like, the opening was awesome rap music. plus the music in the anime was good\
There are three main characters, one had a honorable personality into him, and the other had don't give a s**t personality\

        into him, well the other character is young lady nothing much to say about her but she's important.\

    Well hey all gangsta’s!…. that was completely and utterly messed up. I will try not to do that again. But anyway, I actually loved the mixture of Edo style imagery and the hip hop rap even though a bunch of people would probably say it doesn’t fit. Unfortunately, some of the characters don’t work for me since they seem very out of place. Characters that start raping out of nowhere and those that start talking like gansta’s sometimes make me want to bang my head into the wall. It may fit really damn well with the show but I still want to smack my head\
          \
        into the wall. I did like the main characters though… some a lot more then others.\
Mugen was actually my favorite character. He was pretty bad ass and could take down almost any foe that stood against him. His style of fighting isn’t the normal samurai style but more of just a way of living. To a samurai, the sword is something to live and die with, so he does have a little of the samurai spirit but a samurai also has honor and tact for the most part. He has none of that. He will do as he pleases without any regard to those around him, even starting fights just for the sake of showing how bad ass he is. He loves the spotlight and sometimes I can picture him similar to Black Star from Soul Eater where he would yell out ‘I’ll kill you’ even if he’s supposed to sneak up on them. That personality I would consider childish in some cases but in this, I actually see reasoning behind it. He want’s to be the best he can be and to fight someone when their back is turned may be a disgrace for what little honor he has.\
On the other hand, Jin has much more class to him as a samurai. He was trained professionally and you can see that when the two fight. The styles actually look extremely different as Jin has more of a stiffer pose to him. His background is a pretty tragic one but seems much more common in samurai movies then Mugen’s story line. I can see where Mugen and Jin get onto each other’s nerves. It does make for a very interesting story line when the two need to work together to get out of a bad situation. Most of the time its purely luck based.\
The last main character is sadly the one I like the least. Fuu is a bit, well, I don’t exactly understand why she’s there in the first place. She’s childish, annoying, and whines a hell of a lot. She gets kidnapped almost every single time by the guys that just want to rip Jin’s and Mugen’s heads off. Only a couple times she actually has some marret to the story as she’s most likely the person who can trust others. She is the reason the other two are stuck together but her reason for going on this journey, namely finding a samurai smelling of sunflowers, really has no real fruit to it. You would understand once you watch the ending.\
The animation is rather good, though sometimes can be a little… bla. Manglobe has a thing where they will have really good animation for most of the anime but in some parts, it lacks the beauty the other scenes have. Characters sometimes feel like they are also way to detailed as if the artist was trying to make the show look extremely detailed but it makes the characters look off when it doesn’t happen all the time.\
The English voices are actually really well done and I think that’s partly because of the rap and pop culture references. Jin is silent and Mugen is a badass gangster. The voices work so well that I have to say its one of the best I’ve seen in a while. Even Fuu who is pretty annoying actually has an ok voice. I give the main music props for being one of the most memorable to me. I can’t not think about that fun style of music.\

    What can I say about this anime? If you enjoyed cowboy Bebop you wil probably like this anime also. The story is almost the same: a comedy drama series with a lot of awesome fights and amazing characters. BUT I personally didn't enjoy this series as much as Bebop. Let's start from the beggining. First of al the story itself is not so unique: it's about two ronni's and a girl's quest throughout Japan in order to find ''The samurai who smells of sunflowers'' after the girl's request. The facct that makes the story unique is that this jurney is everything but normal. The anime\
          \
        is full of anachronisms that most of the times are leaving you with a ''wtf did I just watch'' expression. The animation is what makes the anime to really stand out. I just have to tell you that the anime is 10 years old and its more beutifully animated than most of the current anime. I had a little problem with the music. It's not bad but the soundtracks are almost all a weird kind of Japanese hip hop which I personally am not a very big fan. But the voice actors are all awesome (especailly Kazuya Nakai as the protagonist \

    What happens when you mix the Japanese history with contemporary music, season it with average characters and sprinkle it with a bland story? Yes, you get Samurai Champloo!\
I will not lie. I really expected a lot from this anime and the first episode was everything I could ask for. But then things started moving down hill from there. No, rather it snowballed with every episode and by the time it came to the foot of the hill, it was just another anime......\
Since this is mostly going to be a negative review, I'll keep it as short as i possibly can.\
Story : \
Nothing new. Samurai Champloo\
          \
        has a very plain(read: dull,boring) and predictable story line. \
No plot twist (if one can call it so) will surprise you. At no point in the story does anything, and I mean ANYTHING unpredictable happen.  Considering this is a Shounen, maybe I should have seen this coming.\
Art:\
If there is anything positive about Samurai Champloo it is the art and in particular, the animation. Most of the fights are pretty well animated and the art is nice and clean. I don't really have a lot to complain here, so moving on.\
Sound:\
Uncertain. Why you ask? Does todays music suit an anime about Samurai, I don't really know.\
I didn't loathe it, but neither did I like it.  So - uncertain.\
Character: \
Perhaps this is what let me down the most. You have your stereotypical protagonist Mugen, who is brash, dim witted except when it comes to fights and a loud mouth. You have his \"opposite\" Jin, a character who is a loner,well mannered and an equal when it comes to fighting strength. \
And not to forget the bubbly, comical girl Fuu,who is the glue which holds these two together. \
Yes, your everyday Shounen setting. And since Samurai Champloo is only 26 episodes long, neither do the antagonists make any sense nor do they do they have character.\
Enjoyment:\
Hardly any. Just because the fries look crisp and golden that doesn't make them tasty. Just because an anime has been rated highly that doesn't necessarily make it enjoyable.\
Overall: \
Samurai Champloo is a potpourri of everything I don't want to seen in an anime. Lousy story, weird music, and detestable characters.\

But then again, just because I didn't enjoy Samurai Champloo doesn't mean you won't like it..................",

    \"Samurai Champloo\", one of those animes i discover by chance and try to find again, many years later. And i really, really tried to find it again.\
But what i seemed to forget completely is, Hip Hop stuff. And i'm not a huge fan of it. I can like a sound/rythm though. But still, that could have restrained me from loving/appreciating this anime and i must be honest, that pretty worked during almost the half of the episodes.\
I'm not saying \"HipHop\"+\"Samurai\" = Bleh. Hell no ! It's an unusual mix and i guess i needed time to get used to it. It seems to have been\
          \
        successful as i was looking for one specific \"sound\" from the anime and i finally found out that i liked not only one but a few sounds.\
My point here is, you can be not a huge fan of Hip-Hop and finally appreciated \"Samurai Champloo\".\
I guess now i got used to it, if i watch the anime again, i could appreciate even more the entire thing.\
Because, that's a very good anime, with its parts of \"wtf was that...\" and \"H*** S*** WTF\", funny moments, epic ones and badasseries.\

    This is one of the more unique series I have seen to date. It has a mix of action and comedy with Hippity-Hop music playing in the background. The characters are their own individuals and you can easily distinguish them from one another. Mugen was the hard head, ignorant one (due to his upbringing). Jin is the cool, calm, and confident one with Fuu being the loud mouth, hungry one.\
The episodes were episodic so you could go in and watch a random episode and still be vastly entertained. They were essentially spread  going from town to town in order to find \" The Samurai\
          \
        who smells of sunflowers\". Each episode offers an adventure all on its own. The hip-hop really fitted the mood the story was trying to establish and really complete what is otherwise an almost perfect story.\
All in all, if you really enjoy fast sword fighting action with alot of comedy, you will enjoy this anime.\

    Few anime are as much of a joy to watch as Samurai Champloo.  Much of this is due to the immediately likeable trio of Mugen, Jin, and Fu, whose disparate personalities lead to constant humorous interactions.  Indeed, Samurai Champloo manages to pull off what few anime have before: it is sincerely funny, and seldom feels forced.  Add to this a pretty interesting premise, timely social commentary, some badass fight scenes, and a highly engaging and satisfying ending, and you have \
a recipe for a great show.  \
Like other Watanabe series, Samurai Champloo goes above and beyond on animation and audio and\
          \
        treats them as integral to the story itself.  Not only is the scenery exquisite and the fight scenes meticulously crafted, but the animation melds with the original hip hop soundtrack, from the scene cuts to the dialogue to the battles, such that the entire series is hip hop, and it wouldn't be Samurai Champloo otherwise.  While this soundtrack isn't as memorable as that of Cowboy Bebop, it is just as much the soul of the series.\
All of this praise may make it seem as if the show has no faults.  That depends, even more than is ordinarily the case when reviewing anime, on one's perspective.  The bulk of the series is about the journey, rather than the destination, but at times this can make it feel like mostly filler.  Many early episodes do little to advance the plot, apart from bringing our travelers slightly closer to their geographical destination, and consequently the show tends to lack a hook or sense of suspense until the end.  This is not say to say it's uninteresting, so long as you enjoy the characters and the ride.  As a fan of the series, I view Samurai Champloo as simply a fantastic watch, even if the story isn't permeated with deeper meaning or the viewer isn't constantly bombarded with plot.  But if you're only looking for a compelling story, you might be better off skipping to the end.  In any case, this is not a show to pass up.",

    *Quick review:\
***Enjoyable characters + bad-ass swords action, comedy, slice of life, some sexual content. Is this for you?\
Note: D-O  N-O-T judge Samurai Champloo negatively simply because the op/ed themes suck, and time period and setting take place hundreds of years ago in ancient Japan. The anime is very enjoyable!!\
Ok then.\
*This anime has bad-ass swords-fighting!! The two male protagonists are like complete opposites in everything, but both of them are very enjoyable characters.\
*Megun: he is like a lunatic when he fights. Picture a swordsman that uses break dancing moves as he fights. He's bad-ass (and a horny pervert too) lol.\
*Gin: he is the traditional dojo\
          \
        master swordsman. He is super calm, patient, respectful, and everything else opposite to Megun.\
*Fuu: she's the female protagonist. She's funnyy, has not much sexual appeal according to Megun and Jin (lol), but she's funny, and cries when Megun and/or Jin get hurt.\
*The reason for why the story begins may be really dumb and simple and vague, but it still doesn't change the fact that this is one AWESOME anime under the slice-of life and action genres that you will totally enjoy. :P\
*The protagonists are really enjoyable and everyone will like them for sure. The action is kick-ass, as well as the comedy.\
\
===So why should YOU watch Samurai Champloo?===\
\
*Well, if you want to watch a 26-episode anime which has outstanding character development in terms of personality, voice, and the likes, and bad-ass swords fighting which includes two completely different styles, and some nice comedy, and some sexual content, then this is for you! \
**The development of the protagonists and the kick-ass action are the strong points of this anime. Anyone who watches this anime, will have a fun time :P This is one of those few animes that are actually worth re-watching all over again :P  So give this anime a ashot, and you will NOT be disappointed :P\
*I watched most of the episodes in vids.myspace.com. If you can find the subbed ones, then watch the subbed ones, if not, watch them dubbed at myspace.",

    Well what can i say about Samurai champloo\
  well its down witre amazing. I was recomended this anime by one of my friends and i read the story and thought it was so original. I gave it a shot and im happy that i did\
 The story focuses around Fuu Mugen and Jin and came together by fate. Fuu is looking for a samuria who smells of sunflowers and asks Jin and mugen( two samurais) to help her on her journey.\
 Along the way they meet a whole bunch of people and make new friends aswell as enemies.\
You should really consider watching this anime\
          \
        becuase There are little plots in episodes that corisponde with the bigger plot.\
It's like a story being told  about how 3 ttravelers who help  make history as well as sowrd fights , kidnapping and a whole bunch of comedy tide in to 26 episodes it cant get anybetter than that(:\

    \"Why did we even go on this journey in the first place? I can't remember.\"\
Certainly not the strongest words to end a series on unless you are shooting for a piece of existential film-making. But honestly, Mugen is just about dead on with this assessment of the events that took place prior to Samurai Champloo's conclusion- a conclusion that comes with so little suspense and tension, you could have guessed it after the first few episodes. Not to mention the central driving mystery of the show is spoiled about five episodes before the climax! \
What the plot is is your typical ragtag adventure story and\
          \
        perhaps one could argue its not so much about the conclusion as it is about what happened to our protagonists throughout they travels; the point of the journey is not to arrive. And truth be told, some of these little stories are quite entertaining. The show is at its best when it is getting goofy and letting it's obviously diverse set of influences (music, sports, street art) shine brightly. Adversely, it is at its most contrived and tedious when it is spouting the same samurai period-piece tropes that are a dime-a-dozen in the anime medium. \
Much like its spiritual predecessor, Cowboy Bebop, Champloo is crafted with a strong sense of style and an emphasis on music being a way to convey story and emotion. It works well and is entertaining when it strives to do this but when we are left with somber silence and slow paced exposition, things get pretty directionless and bland. \
Where Cowboy Bebop was host to a roster of entertaining characters with rich backstories, populating an inventive and bizarre world, Samurai Champloo features a smaller cast with less humanizing detail written into them and a setting that has been well-tread at this point. I did appreciate the nods to historical accuracy and the brief narration of the history of Japan, but in terms of drama created by the atmosphere of a unique setting, it just can't compete. \
Its a bit damning that show show will probably always be unfavorably compared to Cowboy Bebop, but the thing is they are just too similar for the viewer to not instantly draw comparisons.\
What is handled very well is the fight scenes. It is almost justifiable to forget about the story completely and just soak up the eye candy that is these frenetic and superbly animated sword battles. The creators clearly have a love affair with the concept of the unbeatable swordsman and it appears that far more care was put into these choreographed dances of death than the rest of the show. For all that Mugen may lack as a character, he is fully realized as a furious, agile, improvisational fighter.\
Its a quality show for those who are looking to see some badass fighting set in a traditional Japanese backdrop, with bits of comedic and musical flare peppered in. It just doesn't pull off the drama of this tale, which could have been very engaging, with much finesse. \

    Samurai Champloo is directed by the same director as Cowboy Bebop, so my expectations were very high. Much like Bebop, the narrative is not very straight forward and diverges from time to time. The main story line is very simple and nothing special. There are some pacing problems, some of the \"filler\" episodes contributed almost nothing to the main story line or characterization of the main cast. The animation is fairly consistent, but some episodes it is very apparent that the budget went somewhere else. The show's definitive strong point is its music. The show has one of the most beautiful and unconventional opening themes\
          \
        in anime history. The ending theme is also very beautiful and is great to hear at the end of every episode mush like \"The Real Folk Blues\" was a great send off to at the end of every Bebop episode. The characters have minor backstories, but never stray too far from conventional anime tropes. The characters seem to be lacking a certain depth. This can be my own personal gripe when comparing it with Bebop.  Overall a somewhat enjoyable show with stellar music, but if you are looking for the next Cowboy Bebop, you might find yourself a disappointing show. Somewhat recommended.    \

    There are a lot of problems that permeate Samurai Champloo and take away from what could have been an awesome, stylized adventure through late nineteenth century Japan. These problems are not large, but together they detract from the experience. Samurai Champloo is of course a well-loved anime, and far be it from me to harshly review it, but I shall because that is what I do.\
The story of Samurai Champloo is something that is hard to explain in very long and drawn out terms. The series follows three characters, Foo, Jin, and Mugen, who are each outcasts from their respective walks of life. Foo is\
          \
        just an average girls whose father left her and her mother died. Jin is a samurai who killed his master and is now being chased by the students of the dojo in retaliation. Mugen is a criminal wanted for killing the people on a sugar boat. They come together through a huge coincidence and join forces through the bitchiness of Foo. Foo as a character is something I’ll later discuss. Foo wants to find the samurai who smells of sunflowers and employs the help of Jin and Mugen who don’t like each other and plan to kill each other when the journey is over.\
One of the main things I find to be completely annoying about the series as a whole is how characters are so trusting of these guys who randomly appear to them and want them to do something or follow them. I won’t spoil who every bad guy is, but it seems to me like the writers did not understand that the audience will eventually catch on to the fact that this supposed good guy is a bad guy after the past ten episodes pulled the same trick. While you’re not bound to think of the characters as bad guys sometimes, it’s usually fairly apparent.\
Another problem I have is that the episodic nature of the series makes it perfectly okay to watch the amazing first episode, skip the next twenty-two episodes, and watch the well-done final story-arc. The first episode has an excellent fight in it that is unparalleled until the very end. The last episodes are tense and exciting, which is a lot more than I can say for the cream in the middle of the cookie.\
The middle episodes range from just plain boring, to pretty good. They are fairly forgettable and unimpressive most of the time. There are never bad guys who are anything more than loud and annoying and the constant eating gets to be annoying. There are some episodes that may resonate with a person (the blind woman for instance) but it is otherwise nothing to write home about.\
And I found that the use of a filler episode telling the story of the first eleven episodes was painful. In an episodic show, I don’t think you need to give us a recap of the episodes, because the episodes typically don’t have anything to do with each other and the consequences of actions very rarely resonate later on in the series.\
So let’s look at the animation. Well, there’s nothing much to say here. The characters aren’t great looking, the backgrounds are average. Sword fights are somewhat smooth, though can be a little jerky with the movements.\
The sound is what really makes Samurai Champloo what it is and gives it its cool style. The opening song is probably one of the easier to recognize openings as far as American fans of anime are concerned. The ending isn’t bad either. But during the show, the mix of smooth rap beats, jazz, modern Japanese music, and Japanese folk music, combine in such a way as to make me feel that without that music to help accentuate the style, the anime would be nothing more than another generic historical piece. As far as voice actors are concerned, the American dub is a safe bet if you don’t feel like reading. None of the voice actors are particularly bad and none of the style of the beatboxing nor rapping is lost in the translation.\
The characters are nearly the opposite of the music. They aren’t that great. Foo is annoying and bitchy and gets what she wants and eats too much and is useless. She’s not what you would consider a strong female lead and typically is found captured or crying or something that just makes you shake your head and wish for more of Mugen or Jin. Mugen is not a great character, his rather rude manner isn’t anything we haven’t seen before, but he can be likeable and funny. Jin is also a generic character that has a life of his own because of those comedy moments and his interactions with Mugen. Foo’s bodyguards being from completely different walks of life makes for, as I’m sure you can tell, some funny moments, as well as some violent moments. The only reason that Mugen and Jin are ever good characters that you can remember long after the final episode is the interactions they share. But otherwise, the characters of the show are forgettable. There aren’t any recurring characters but two, and they are just there for comedy. Otherwise, even the final bad guys are fairly shallow in both intentions and emotions.\
When I was nearing the last episodes I was fairly certain I wasn’t going to like this anime very much. And then there were zombies. And then I nearly grew to hate it. And then there was a pointless baseball episode. And then I hated it more. But the end did redeem it a lot, and I feel that as an anime, overall, it’s not bad. If taken as weekly doses, it is definitely not going to be unappealing to fans of historical dramas. But if you plan to sit through episode after episode in a sort of marathon, it’s not something you’ll find too enjoyable. It’s just the sheer fact that taken as a whole, Samurai Champloo is both shallow in characters, story, and will never hold a place in the pantheon of amazing anime. It’s merely a distraction, not a great one, but it does have its moments and it has that interaction between Jin and Mugen, well-done interactions at that, and an urban style that it uses to its’ advantage. To me, it felt like Lone Wolf and Cub for the modern age (and there is a point where there is a reference to the classic manga), and it plays out in the episodic nature that the Lone Wolf and Cub manga did. The only problem is that while Lone Wolf and Cub was fresh and amazing to a new American manga audience in the 80’s, Samurai Champloo is nothing more than a generic period drama that is only different in its use of urban style.\
So basically, I’m saying Samurai Champloo isn’t something you’re going to remember, though it can be a fun ride for those really starved for some swordplay.\

    I had this series in my plan to watch list for a very long time, hesistant to watch it, because I heard that it was mainly episodic. For me personally, episodic anime aren't bad, but if a anime lacks a constant story with a clear goal ahead, it is very hard for me to keep focus.\
In Samurai Champloo's case however, it works amazingly well and I can even say it adds to it's strenght.\
This series is made by studio Manglobe, which also made the amazing classic Cowboy Bepop (which is also mainly episodic) and it's recent mediocre Gangsta. Unfortunately, studio Manglobe has become bankrupt and\
          \
        it is very saddening to know that they could be never making such classics again.\
I can fairly say that Manglobe outdid themselves this time with Samurai Champloo. There is a reason why I immediatly put this series in my favorites list. It has a perfect balance of great comedy, amazing characters/development, serious situations/fights and a good overall story/direction.\
The story in itself isn't very thrilling or deep if Samurai Champloo aimed to be a story driving series. However, in a mainly episodic series, the story is just right to keep the viewer interested without being too complicated. This isn't a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, but it does it's job in giving the characters a reason to keep fighting and keep moving in this Edo-styled world. \
Aside from the main story, the individual episodes are very well done story-wise. It varies from extremely funny, to very sad and it never bores the viewer. There are also some twists in certain parts of the stories which keeps you interested. \
Considering it's a series that dates back to the year 2004, the art is still up to par and it is beautifull to look at. The characters are nicely animated, the fights are fast-paced and amazing to look at. The backgrounds are mostly well done, but it could have been a bit more detailed for me sometimes. The animation is overall very fluent and it is hard to criticize it. \
I really appreciated the descision that they made regarding the sound. The opening is very different from the normal Jpop songs, and the added hiphop elements in there made it a very memorable series. You don't see this very often and you will probably see it never again in a series centered in the Edo-period. \
The voice actors for the main characters are pefectly chosen. They all feel so natural and it would be weird without those voices. If you can achieve that, than your doing your job right. \
The characters are the series biggest selling point. You have the airheaded and big breast loving Mugen, who likes to eat, fight and have sex. You have the quiet and samurai-like Jin, who can have a fun side aswell. At last you have the young, eccentric and loudmouthed Fuu, who is actually the most serious one of them all when it comes to the normal things.\
All three of these characters work really well together and add alot of seriousness and comedy to the series. All three have a sad past and the series gives them enough time to develop. \
The side characters are also really well done, every mini-arc has loveable characters who you can really feel for. \
I would definitely reccomend this series solely on all the characters.\
I would never have thought that I would enjoy this series as much as I did. I kept wachting episode after episode, because everything just worked so well. I wanted to see how the main story unfolded, but the part that I liked most where the funny episodic stories in which the side-characters shined the most. I can never get enough of Mugen, Jin and Fuu and I was sad that the series ended. \
Overall, the story is good and compelling for an episodic series. Each episode has an intersting story and great characters to go with it. Our main cast is just so fun to be with and you feel like your going on the adventure with them. The hiphop elements really gave this series some uniqueness and it didn't felt out of place at all. The art was very well done and the fight scenes were amazing and fluid.\
This series in on par with the highly praised classic Cowboy Bebop and I would reccomend this series to anyone who likes a funny, but also serious series with great fights and a certain uniqueness to it. \
Don't let the term 'episodic' scare you, just like it did to me. If you finally decide to watch it than you will have an amazing time ahead of you.",

    For my anime reviews I am going to review the anime on the order of which you would experience while watching an episode of the anime that is being reviewed.\
1.Art - Well the art for this anime was very realistic right of the bat.  It had a down to earth feel but that being said,  it did not fail to be a very beautiful show.  Instead of creating a false sense of beauty the art seemed to try to capture the natural beauty of Japan and I believe it did so flawlessly.  The character models were very well thought out. \
          \
        The style for each of the characters was reminiscent of their personalities so in that aspect the art was also perfect.  The art was flawless in this anime but that being said it was definitely not the best art I have ever seen so i'll give the art a 9.\
2.Sound - I really love what the director did with the soundtrack in this anime.  Somehow they were able to fuse sword fighting in the Edo period with modern day hip-hop.  IT IS GENIUS.  I have no complaints about this soundtrack it was literally perfect in my mind.  It was also a very innovative idea for the time being. I give sound a 10.\
3.Character - The characters were probably my favorite part about this anime.  They were all unique and you never had trouble relating to a character.  I don't think I've ever seen a show with characters as relatable as the ones in samurai champloo.  The characters also got a lot of background and the were all very legitimized.  It is very awesome to watch relationships within the characters develop and I absolutely loved it.  It's a definite 10/10.\
4.Story - The story was definitely a long tormented journey.  It was not a bad story I'm just saying it was very distracted from it's original storyline.  That being said, it was not a bad distraction.  I really enjoyed all the episodes even though most of them didn't have to do with the story.  This was my second time watching this anime so I was impressed I didn't get bored with the story.  In that aspect it was a great story.  By the way the end of the show was kinda sad because of how much I loved the characters.  I want to give the story a good score but the story got so sidetracked I can't give it an amazing score, so...... 7.\
5.Enjoyment - Well....... I really enjoyed this anime, and I know that by my reviews you can tell that I enjoy most anime I watch in some shape or form but the reason I liked this anime was because it felt so mature.  I can't explain why it would feel so mature to me but somehow it did.  It kinda felt like I was watching a badass samurai hip-hop soap opera but the sidetracked story took from my enjoyment so I'll give enjoyment a 8/10.\
This anime is an overall 8.\
Caution:\
!Keep in mind this anime has nudity.\
!Keep in mind this anime has intense gore.\

    This anime is quite straightforward, so this review will be simple and straightforward too.\
It was directed by Watanabe Shinichiro, who also did Cowboy Bebop so these 2 anime have a similar style in pacing and presentation,and was produced by manglobe which I personally like very much so you can expect quality animation.The anime has hip hop inspired themes mixed with Edo period elements.A pretty interesting mix and outcome\
1.Story ~ 7\
The story is quite simple.Two warriors help a cute and helpless girl on a quest to find someone from her past.Lots of action and comedy ensues.I gave it a 7 because despite it being a simple\
          \
        and satisfying story,many times when watching the show I found myself a bit tired of the many filler-like episodes.They were entertaining and fun but they made me feel that the show was going too slow for my taste.\
2.Characters ~7\
Again straightforward characters.You get what you expect from them at first glance.That's not necessarily bad though.Both warriors are extremely badass and the girl protagonist is entertainlgy clever and comical.I gave the characters a 7 because they are were not developed enough in the course of the anime,when they had potential to do so.\
3.Sound ~10\
There is nothing much to be said about the sound.It's mainly the work of Nujabes.It's simply amazing and that's coming from someone that dislikes hip hop in general.The sound overall leaves nothing to be wanted and again something more.\
4.Art ~9\
I believe its animation and art in general is the main focus of this anime.Overall it was excellent with a few minor bad moments like wierd facial expressions (hence the 9).The fighting scenes were some of the best I've ever seen in action anime.The colours were bright but not annoying at all.They were very well used.The hip hop theme adds a very unique flavour to the anime that you won't soon forget.Another key aspect that should be noted is the directing/pacing of the episodes.Each episode was done in a non- linear way.Some episodes were developed backwards and some in a parallell way.Sometimes this can be a disaster but in this case it was not and it developed smoothly in each episode.\
Enjoyment ~9\
It's clear I liked this anime very much.I have finished it 3 times and I don't regret it.I gave it a 9 because it didn't touch perfection even by my subjective viewpoint, but it did what it promised excellently.\
Overall ~ 8\
I will finish this review with some very contadicting words that I think fit this case very well.This anime is objectively enjoyable(it can be enjoyed by almost everyone).It's a very ''light'' watch (a few dark moments here and there) and very memorable as well.So..well..just give it a try.You won't regret it.\

    The story is great. However it is kinda mixed up. It is kinda like Cowboy Bebop, where the 1st episode and the last were mostly the main story for it, it applies for Samurai Champloo to. The art is amazing, and the music is great too. The Characters are also really great. They all each have a different personality and you just don't want to see their journey end. You would really enjoy this anime if you like samurais, cowboy bebop (because it kinda has the same feel except its in the Edo Period), a anime where it doesn't really take itself seriously (except some\
          \
        parts), fighting, or anything. Just watch it because it has everything drama, action, adventure, and comedy.  Well that's it,   Happy Anime Watching\

    Samurai Champloo is one of my favourite Animes. Why? because of the way every aspect of this anime is put together and works well. \
The story line, have you ever seen such differnt people?\
19-20 year old Mugen, a rouge 'Punk' like Guy that when growing up had one thing that was important and one thing only -Survive-\
20 year old Jin, a seriously skilled, calm, and the silent samurai. An outstanding student when he was being taught and a\
          \
        strict follower of Bushido.\
And last but not lest, 15 Year old Fuu. A young girl who lived with her mother up to some point until she died and Fuu was left alone to find her own way in life, Never knew her father.\
All three of these characters were brought together and started on a long journey. Im not spoiling, im not telling you how, that for you to find out for yourself :) I enjoyed this anime, it was action packed and had an equal amount serious, intense moments and Funny, carefree moments.  \
I loved watching these three very different people travel through this journey and to see all the obsticles that they overcame and what they dicovered about each other :))\
I would recomend this anime to anyone who enjoys action and anything to do with the old style japan. :))\

    Where do I start to an unbelievable anime. Okay well the story is just amazing!!!  Mugen and Jin, two random samurais that know each other for only 1 hour made a promise with Fuu that they will help her on her journey to find the samurai that smells like flowers.  There is a lot of action, and I mean a lot, and with a lot of action there is a lot of comedy.  Non stop action, non stop comedy, just incredible. The anime was made back in 2004 but the art work is just so amazingly old school. BTW this anime is\
          \
        rated R for the action and, AND DEFINITELY definitely the comedy. See this anime made me laugh so much in every episode that I fell of my chair, AND at the same time there was so much action. Whats cool is that the world they live in is a hip hop world not like any other samurai world.  I strongly believe that if you just watch the first episode you will love it.\

Its funny, awesome to look at, and its as realistic as it gets. the fighting scenes are very well put together, though i feel there should be more of them. This show should be show should be seen, with or without recommendation unless you have something better to do then sit on your fat ass and watch TV.\
Nujabes makes this show pretty enjoyable as well with some awesome beats. Though Nujabes died in a car accident witch makes me sad. That's all i have to say. Rest In\

    Just simple one of the best and most fresh series of the samurai genre. There is lots of action a \"damsel\" in distress and a frisky hero-of-sorts aiming to simply have fun fighting people with his unorthodox style. Lots of laugh moments as well as some emotive moments. By far my favorite episode is the 23rd. So much laughter in one episode. Highly recommended.\

    Samurai Champloo is a fairly old anime now at least [meaning this review is real real late!]. I'm sure many people have seen it, but I'm more curious about those who've simply heard of it, haven't watched it, or maybe haven't even heard of it.\
\
If someone already hadn't made it clear, Champloo is a apparently a Japanese word meaning Mix or Blend. The series does exactly that, bringing contemporary hip-hop motifs into late Edo period Japan.\
\
The show is very fun and its periodic battles really work to make the two samurais [Mugen and Jin] appear much more cool. Staying in line with pre-established themes, both\
          \
        samurais are presented more and more difficult foes that they eventually conquer, much like any other combat oriented anime or manga.\
\
Another element that drives the entire story is Fuu's desire to find the Samurai that smells of sunflowers. The anime elaborates and develops this plot point mid way into the series and ultimately yields an arc that gives the anime a satisfying end. Since this is an anime about a journey, it's almost like a slice of life anime.\
\
Each quest attempts to develop the characters further, introduce more elements into the story, and strengthen the bond between the traveling trio.\
\
The ending is bittersweet, which is my opinion, probably one of the best ways to end an anime or manga since -- the ending of a series can rarely ever be purely happy since it's ending. The ending is open ended but offers enough details to imply all the possibilities that could exist after the 26th episode comes to a close, leaving it to the viewers imagination. \
\
To top it off, the ending presents the best example of Fuu, Jin, and Mugen being dynamic characters. They all gain something from the journey, learn about each other, and more importantly -- themselves. In a world they felt alone in, they can finally feel a sense of company or togetherness -- even as they go their separate ways.\
\
The visuals are great. The style is fairly realistic with some exaggerated moments. Combat is highly stylized and fun with lots of movement and little pauses to think and ponder the enemy's fighting style, think about next moves, etc.\
\
The sound is good and the music varies from hip-hip to traditional Japanese music. You may be familiar with Obokuri-Eeumi, a song sang by Ikue Asazaki, that is played during a certain episode in the series. The intro song is very somber and downplayed in spite of being hip-hop but the sad/uplifting ending themes are very nice [in my opinion].\
\
Overall, the one thing I really liked about this anime was the connection I felt to the characters. I desperately wanted them to stay together forever[a condition commonly found with most anime and manga], but I was fully aware of the inevitable end to their journey -- Heck!, even the characters  knew. Additionally, this was an anime that I felt motivated to watch. Certain anime, I get tired of watching an episode or two, but with Samurai Champloo -- I wanted to keep watching episode after episode.\
\
If you haven't already watched Samurai Champloo, please consider watching it. The 26 episodes is definitely worth it and offers a unique experience that's rare in the anime/manga world. \
\
If you've already watched it -- maybe it watch it again!\
\
Thanks for your time and have a good day!\

    A classic Samurai anime with a very cool, edgy twist in style and story-telling. While Samurai Champloo may leave you wanting more at its conclusion, it never falls short in entertainment value. One of the highlights is the soundtrack, which really pumps further value into the style and and delivery. Nujabes, now passed, crowns the peek of his career with his melodic, thumping hip hop that echos with a series that is just plain cool. You either love or hate the characters, but you'll always enjoy when the swords are drawn and the music gets cranking.\

    Unfortunately I have to disagree with the other glowing reviews. I found this anime rather uninteresting. The characters were somewhat interesting, but I get the feeling that they are not unique at all. The story is also straight forward as well. While the way it is told is certainly unconventional, I found myself bored due to the slow pacing of this anime. The sound is nice and fits well with the respective scenes in the anime though. My personal enjoyment was not very high and I struggled to finish the early episodes. \

    I am an avid fan of Hip-Hop. You could go so far as to say I'm a Hip-Hop aficionado. The beats, hooks and rhythm can really pull a track together. If there's one thing I like more than Hip-Hop, it's Beatboxing! So this anime was an instant must-see in my book!\
I saw a few episodes on Cartoon Network back in 2004, but didn't really keep up with it then. I downloaded it a while ago and watched it from start to finish. Overall, this series was very well done. Nothing really seemed superfluous. The only episode I didn't like was Episode 22 (Cosmic Collisions). Maybe\
          \
        it's because I'm not a fan of the Zombie genre of Horror, but it seemed like the series would have been fine without it. Other, than that. everything about this anime is superb! The story flows very well, and there's lost of fast-paced action and very little down time. Also, who wouldn't like Beatboxing samurai?!\

    This is a really good anime, but it shares it faults too. It took me a few weekss to finish this just because i had to find myself in the mood to watch it, but when i did watch it i didnt want to stop. The action is really cool and awsome looking, but at times when there wasnt any i found myself getting bored. The dialogue is intresting and really funny at times. Some of the arcs are somewhat boring and repetitive but always have some cool action to draw you back in. Each character gets some back story as to their origins and\
          \
        i found those the most enjoyable. One of the downfalls is after an arc there is a time skip leaving it seem like it never happened, i just wish they had more of a long term effect on the characters. Although it seems like i downed this anime a lot it is really good and i would definitely recommend it, it has a strangely fitting soundtrack and strong ending!\

It also features, in my opinion, some of the best fight sequences I've ever watched. Jin is an honorable swordsman who is very modest. Yhen you have Mugen who will call you a bitch and put his steel plate sandals right into your face as he hacks you to pieces. \
A definite must if you like watching swordplay at its finest!\

    First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\
-----\
This one is a bit of odd case to review. One reason is that this is re-watch. I watched this anime 2009. And I don't review nor re-score re-watched things, but since this score decision basically didn't change for me, I decided to review it nevertheless.\
----\
Story is simple enough, it's about trio that ends up meeting, adventuring together to find certain person. They will encounter all sorts of enemies whilst keeping up with comedy aspect. For most part I did enjoy the story, it felt episodic yet\
          \
        with end-game goal and was presented in enjoyable manner. Had its funny moments and great battles. Probably only complaint I have is that the whole hip-pop and rap usage wasn't really to my taste. (probably did enjoy it back in days). Though funny thing about the story, for some reason it felt like I was watching this anime for the first time. I did remember the main characters but the content of the story fell so stranger for me. As never seen the anime before. Anyhow, story feels polished and fun, as well was given satisfying enough ending.\
Art, now art for 2005 anime feels superb. Or actually even to more common recent anime, the art of this anime was superb. It great great art and very good animation. So regarding art I got absolutely no complaints. Same for the music/ost for the most part. It was quite enjoyable and good.\
\
As for characters I'm not sure what to comment aside the main trio. We got the silent & disciplined samurai. The erratic and aggressive ronin and a \"straight act\" girl. All I can tell that this synergy between the characters felt spot-on enjoyable. A bit for everyone, whatever is your taste. In another words very enjoyable characters. There were plenty of cool enemies, some morons and odd comedy aspect characters.\
So by the end of the day. I did enjoy this Anime quite a lot. Even if seems my brain deleted memory of watching it back in the days. I did \"re-enjoy\" it. Samurai anime with funky thematic, cool action and enjoyable comedy aspect. If those are things you are looking for, then this piece of work is definitely worth a watch.\

    Im not that into samurai anime, those classing sword-fighting with noble characters set on a journey towards the bigger \"better me\". No, i dont really chase this genre.\
But somehow my interests were piqued when i saw this anime.\
Before started enjoying the anime, i've enjoyed Nujabes for long time. It's always so satisfying to listen to him on good weed or in an evening breeze nap. Long story short, i was googling him. His death, his piece. And that's how i was introduced into this warm anime.\
The director made the notable Cowboy Bebop. One of the show i've watched in cool mode. No rush, no binge,\
          \
        full enjoyment. Therefore there is more reason to watch Samurai Champloo.\
It's rather a minimum requirements anime than a sideshow. Means there is some terms and condition. One you watch when you have nothing on your watchlist. Series you watch when you're ready to take a trip into a psychedelic Edo-Period Japan for the good times of it. For me, this is not the anime that \"i'll watch this while waiting for the new episode of blabla\". Because when you bucked your seatbelt, clicked on the first episode, there is no rest area.\
This anime, like Cowboy Bebop, is a cocktail of culture. A samurai life-code mixed with poverty with the dressing of hip-hop, graffiti, and common sense-lacking main character. To top it off, got poured at it a great deal of sexual appeal and dick-rocking babes.\
Story was not so bad. Cliche, though it must be said. Still, it was an enjoyable journey. United at a teahouse, Fuu, the heroine, asked Mugen and Jin to accompany her finding a samurai that smells sunflower. Mugen and Jin is the hero of the day, fighting on each ass to help her out. All because betting on a bad side against her. Not a really compliacted main arc. Thus, we depart.\
I expected to see a biased story of one hero. Since i don't believe there is such thing as 2 main characters in one team in one go.\
And mother, was i wrong.\
The screentime of each main is surprisingly balanced. Mugen is the foul-mouthed type, while Jin is the cool hero that gets the job done. This oil and water samurai is united by a bond, i may say love, towards Fuu. The clumsy, everywoman with extraordinary big spirit. This is a samurai-based series afterall. All wrapped up in an epic character development of slow tempo and well-written script. The build is almost perfect.\
The music is, alluring, satisfying, neatly-made score with well chosen musician. There is no single bad-thing about this series' scores.\
Artstyle is something un-discussable, just perfect.\
Not seen much heartwarming seinen anime nowadays so this was a good getaway for me. 9/10\

    While the art style was great and the fight sequences were eloquent and exemplified each character's personality, Samurai Champloo was a near perfect anime. \
I feel most of the appeal is at the beginning of their adventure, but in the remaining few episodes, I began to lose interest. This is definitely an example where the journey rather than the destination was important, which is what most animes should strive for anyway. But with two of the episodes leading up to the climax seeming like filler and the climax itself being mildly unsatisfying, I find the ending a bit lackluster.\
Above all of that, I can understand\
          \
        why this is one of the must-watch cult classics of anime and would highly recommend it. The soundtrack is incredible. The personality of the show is addictive. And the characters themselves, although kind of tropey at times, are inspiring in their own right.\

    (NO SPOILERS) Firstly this anime isn't a mainstream type. So people out there want something else other than Shounen and action type can watch this. It also contains action sequences but driven by the story. It is an episodic anime so if u didn't feel it appealing after 6 episodes it is better to drop it. There is no major plot or twists or Centiment. It's an easy going anime. You can watch it if you have no expectations. My advice is not.to marathon it. Let it be one to two.episodes a day. \
One of the unique thing about this anime is it's music. \

        Shinichirō Watanabe did a very great job. Some peppy tunes blending with the scene is a visual treat\

    Samurai Champloo. The synopsis sounded interesting enough and who doesn't like a bit of swordplay after all? If only it was that good.\
I decided to watch this based on the many positive reviews it got on MAL, I'd hoped I could get an interesting anime but it ended up being mostly a waste of time.\
First review ever, be ever so kind, I'm hardly an expert on animation.\
Story: 2\
It's pathetic. There is no way around it, this anime has no story whatsoever, none, zero. The inept girl is out to find the samurai that smells of sunflowers. That's the story, the whole of it, and if\
          \
        there were some interesting things to find out during this journey, it wouldn't be so bad. But there's almost nothing to find out. The first 11 or so episodes are some of the worst I've ever seen in an anime, boring beyond belief. You know the filler episodes of something like Naruto or Gintama? That's what this anime seems, filler episodes upon filler episodes. The trio travels and finds itself in clichée situations  that bear the same boring \"yaaahhh let's kill'em all\" kind of result. There is nothing interesting in what they do, if you watched the first episode and skipped to the last you'd lose nothing at all so far as the story is concerned, it's *that* bad.\
Also, the way it ends is appallingly stupid. Even an anime such as this.\
Art: 4\
I like the fighting although it looks honestly passable but nothing that today would look amazing by any stretch of the imagination. The backgrounds are anonymous and moreover, I can't stomack the way the characters are drawn. Fuu (the girl) in particular looks just BAD. Not intentionally bad, just sloppily bad. If you want a good looking anime, go elsewhere, is what my advice would be.\
Sound: 5\
Mediocre. I finished watching it a week ago or so and I can't even remember the intro but I can't remember anything that really irked me in particular either. It's competent, I guess that can be sufficient.\
Character: 2\
This is by far the worst part of this anime. The characters are APPALLING. I'm not even joking, they're absolutely useless. Forgettable. They don't grow or change a single bit, they don't show anything interesting and they have the most clichée of backgrounds.\
Enter Fuu, your typical incompetent good-for-nothing girl who can't do anything by herself. Episode 1 Fuu is *exactly* the same as episode 26 Fuu. She still can't do jack unless it's eating (oh man she can eat a lot, isn't that a funny character trait? Never seen that one before!).\
Enter Jin, your boring-as-ever obvious ronin guy (but he's quirky, he got dem glasses!). Guess what, he killed the master of his dojo, I've never seen that one before either (yeah it's for some secret reason that is as obvious as the sun, he's not REALLY a bad guy, I bet you never saw that one coming)! He's the strong silent type but awww with a good heart, he remains the strong silent type with a good heart and is utterly boring for the entirety of the anime. I kind of like him for the simple fact that he doesn't really talk but that's about it.\
Enter Mugen, your typical scoundrel-that-kills-people-cuz-why-not-lolz. The character that grated on me the most for some unknown reason. Guess what, he had a real bahd childhood and he learnt that he can only rely on his strength to survive (never seen that one before, thrice in a row!). And guess what, since Fuu is useless and Jin is a bore he has to be the as-mental-as-you-wish character, killing anyone because it's fun and being a perv because Jin and Fuu were obviously not fit for the role. And that's it, he doesn't change, he doesn't learn anything (oh, but he feels a bit of affection for Fuu by the end of the story! Isn't that cute?), he just stays an idiot who can only solve things by killing them.\
Enjoyment/Overall: 5\
This anime could be named \"I bet you've never seen that one before!\". All animes and stories in general are like that, there is nearly no originality but they can develop something that's already been seen into something interesting, be it with a well written story or some amazing characters.\
Samurai champloo does neither. The first 10-11 episodes are junk, they're such an utter waste of time that I would beg of you to skip them straight away if you decided to watch this. The second part of the anime has a few nice episodes to its name and it gets the pathetic character \"\"\"\"\"development\"\"\"\" that this anime can claim but overall, if you see where an episode is going (you wll be able to very soon) and you don't think it's interesting, skip it, you'll lose nothing whatsoever in the grand scheme of things.\
I feel a 5 is too generous but the second part got a few chuckles and a pair of side-characters that even if not developed in the slightest, were still immensely more interesting than the main trio. If you don't mind an anime made of filler episodes and you actually enjoy the characters as they are in episode 1, you can probably give it a go.\

    Samurai Champloo is a series I've always remembered. Asking me what was one of the best sword fighting anime and I'd say the obvious. Its been a long time ago, and recently, I've only viewed crappy anime series one after the other, especially this winter season in MAL, so I've rewatched the samurais in action, though still at episode 3. Some series this season, I've already read in manga so there's no surprise there if I don't watch the moving pictures. The unknown part is gone so why bother.\
I could say though, if I read a manga version of this series, I would be missing\
          \
        out big time, as the one quality that makes this series great is its sequence of movements. The almost real time actions, swordfights was captured here. This is just my opinion, I'm no sword fighting expert, if such things exist, but when a swordsman swings a sword, this movement would be in a flash, then he would move in a way to balance himself and prepare either for a defense, or offence. What I mean is that he/her movements would be based on the momentum he/she created and I observed this on Samurai Champloo. \
Though I have great admiration for the animation, the story does not come behind either. This wouldn't be a rated 9 if it weren't so, as I put utmost importance in stories. A high spec computer would be useless for a novice programmer. I think 80 percent of entertainment value comes from the story to the many of us. And two samurais itching to end each other but can't because of this promise they were forced to take due to circumstances is such a story. I mean, they had this honor as a samurai. And to top if off, a revenge plot is involved here. Two characters with opposite personalities and a cute, strong willed girl in a period where swords unsheathed to problems unresolved? Doesn't get any better, wouldn't you say?\
By the way, I've only noticed it now, perhaps I forgot, but why Champloo... oh yeah (literally just remembered this after a 5 second pause) , it's because of the samurai, a different one, whose the objective of this whole series smells of champloo, a kind of flower, as the girl remembers it, the only clue for this deadly mission of theirs.\

    I was pretty well prepared for Samurai Champloo because I have watched Cowboy Bebop which was directed by the same guy. It is different and yet has the same style. It is better and worse though that opinion is mostly due to personal taste and time of exposure. I liked it mostly for the same reasons I liked Bebop.\
The story starts by introducing Mugen, Jin, and Fuu, members of the Edo period. Fuu enlists the help of the two boys in order to find the samurai that smells of sunflower. She does not explain why she wants to find him or who he is and\
          \
        is only able to keep the boys with her due to saving their lives. The anime basically follows their journey to its end. This includes lots of searching/ stealing/ working for food, fights over food/ money/ work, helping random people and of course a lot of killing/ battles. The show is very episodic with only two or three 2 episode sequences before the end. It deals with a lot of realistic logistical problems with a LOT of modern additions to the time period including drugs/ hippies, modern painting and much other modern art references including  graffiti, hip hop, zombies, and baseball (which by the way is the best episode of the whole thing). The feel and style  almost a direct match with Bebop. The end will either leave you growling or extremely fulfilled because it's one of a kind. \
The art is different. It took me a while to get used to it, and I still don't like it. The color scheme is a gorgeous, slightly faded rainbow that gives it the distinct look of parchment or old paper. It looks a lot like the old Chinese landscape paintings. The lines are what put me off. They are thick like in Bebop, but there's a lot of sharp angles. The characters all look ridiculously skinny with large, long muscles giving it a drumstick-of-a-chicken look. I don't really know how else to describe it. However, the story is worth the weird art. The sound is a nice relaxing beat with a few traditional songs that I totally loved. I listened to the intro every time because the art and the music work together perfectly. The music's mostly subtle in its affect, but it gives the show its feel. \
The characters are excellent, but it's hard to like them in a fangirl way. They all have their backstories though it doesn't show much of them, and they each have a distinct perspective. But, they're not really nice people more like scum of the earth types. They also don't go through a lot of character growth. The only thing that changes about them is how they see each other, and that's where the shows genius lies.\
I really wanted to give it a 9 like Bebop, but overall my score is 8/10. I didn't like the art; and, even though the story is better than Bebop's, I saw the idea in Bebop first. Both the sub and the dub are good, but I suggest the dub because it fits the style better. I loved the end both because it didn't follow the norm and because it felt okay that it didn't. The show teaches a lesson that is difficult to accept but absolutely crucial to understand. If you liked Cowboy Bebop, you will like this. If you haven't seen Cowboy Bebop and don't like slow, daily life anime, you probably won't like it; but, as I always say, give it a try before you judge.  \

    I had high expectations and I was dissapointed.\
At the end of the series I felt somewhat cheated, like something great was about to happen and yet it didnt.  \
I expected something more, that ungtangible feeling that we get when we watch the final episode of a great show and say:\
\"WOW!\"\
I didnt have that feeling with this show.\
Story:\
The story is basic, 3 travellers are on a journey through Japan to meet a man.  The series shows their adventures and misadventures throughout their journey.\
Art:\
It has a clear, distinct art style with some fantastic visuals and stills.\
Sound:\
The quirkyness of the characters you meet throughout their journey\

        is highlighted by the excellent actors used.\
Characters:\
Characters are solid and well throught out, one of the shows saving graces.\
Enjoyment:\

Overall:\
It was a good show, the art, sound and characters being the shows only saving graces.\
For me there were 5 episodes that stood out in this series and I strongly recommend.\

Gamblers and Gallantry ep.11\
War of the Words ep. 18\
Elegy of Entrapment eps. 20 and 21\

    I have never seen Cowboy Bebop nor will i make any connections relating the two. This review is solely based after watching Samurai Champloo.\
STORY:\
Not the most complex of stories and most of the series feels like a bunch of fillers. There are little bits of clues here and there but overall any episode could easily be mistaken for the second episode. However, Samurai Champloo is another anime in which the actual enjoyment comes from the personality of each character. Try to show your friends an episode that you cried laughing to and they just wouldn't understand...\
QUALITY:\
Samurai Champloo is available in 1080p and 720p via fansub\
          \
        and bluray disk. Personally i was content with the 720p versions sent out by Cman. Visually, Samurai Champloo is a collaboration of japanese portraits itself with its unique drawings. Animation can get a little weak at times but graphics are crisp.\
EPISODES:\
Every episode feels like a filler except for a hand full of episodes explaining the characters backgrounds and personality. But in the end, each episode strengthens the relationship between the characters and the person watching the anime. Notably, the baseball episode is Hilarious after establishing all the characters. \
MUSIC:\
Samurai Champloo has to have one of the best OSTs. Influenced by traditional Japanese and underground hip hop, Samurai Champloo will leave you searching for more artists under the hip hop genre. Powerful opening by Nujabes and just overall great composure, Samurai Champloo blends greatly with its soundtrack.\
OVERALL:\
Although Samurai Champloo falls short of a solid original story it makes up with  short laugh episodes. Its one of those animes where waiting one week for a new episode will in the end piss you off. However, strong music and character  relationships saves this anime from being over looked.\

    As a guy who really did not enjoy cowboy bepop, samurai champloo was a completely different story, It is set in a pre technological age which is a turn on for animes like this because we all absolutely love our epic sword fights without someone pulling out a rocket launcher and firing everyone down. Samurai champloo does not have a very thick plot or barely any plot at all to be honest, but it does have three very interesting characters, while they act like they hate being together it is blatantly obvious for us viewers that secretely they love each others company. \
Story:\
Error 404, story\
          \
        not found. Ok, I lied there is a very small portion of story in this anime but not much unless you count 'to search for the samurai that smells of sunflowers' as a story which I guess you could, it's mostly episodic apart from the last few episodes which have a connection of plot in them. \
Art: The art in this anime is perfect in my opinion, in the sense that is exactly what the anime is looking for, a pre technological age type of art that sets the time of the story, it is not the best art in anime history because it is not meant to be, in my opinion the anime producers got exactly what they were going for with the art of the anime.\
Sound: Some days, some nights, some live, some die in the way of the samurai! The opening is insanely good I find myself singing it a lot even if it has been a while since I finished this anime, it is in english which is different from the normal japanese. It has good music in the epic fights and the sound matches the environment the characters are currently in well\
Character: This is the most epic part of the anime, the characters. These are not your typical anime 'rejects or losers' who grow to become badasses as the anime progresses, these characters are actually badass from the start and are naturally stronger than everyone they come across which is good to see once in a while as we are used to the old 'get owned at the start then make a comeback' sort of thing. The girl has a way of getting sold to a brothel in almost every episode which is humorous. It is very satisfying to see Muden and Jin just completely wreck everything that comes in their way as I said before, we do not get to see this very often. \
Enjoyment: Very enjoyable anime, not a brain teaser, very relaxing to watch if you want a break from the very intense and dramatic animes.\
Overall: A recommended watch, if you love your samurais (and who doesn't).....(except yugioh players haha) then what are you waiting for? Go and enjoy this anime as much as I and a lot of others have, have fun! \

    samurai champloo takes \
place during edo period japan but has a hip-hop type theme to the show.this anime has 3 main charecters,fuu the clumsy \
but adorable teenage girl,mugen an uncontrolable time bomb but is one of the most badass charecters in anime and jin,\
the calm and collected traditional samurai,plus fuu has a little flying squirrel as a pet named mo-mo and is arguablly \
one of the coolest pets in anime,anyway on to the plot,after being capurtured and set up for public exicution,fuu makes \
them promise her something in exchange she'll set them free,after being freed they set put keep their promise which \
was to help\
          \
        fuu find the samurai that smells of sunflowers.now this is good plot but the show rarely follows about 7 or\
8 episodes focus on this plot,the rest of the episodes are about the indivisual romances of the charecters,an indaian,\
the undead,a blind assassin,the yakuza,and a gay euorpin guy,this anime is like one long roadtrip but with some action.\
now the ending i thought it was kinda a cop out,the ending wasnt so much as bad but it was just kinda an ending,but you\
what they say its not the destination but the journey.i thought there was some pretty good charecter development we got \
to see the past of each of the charecters,we got to see these charecters frow and i got attached to all 3 of them,the \
art work was wonderful really good really fluent during fighting scenes and just good vibrant artwork,now towards the \
end of the series the quality stopped being as good i dont know why i guess the studio just ran out of funding.though \
samurai champloo has action and at times is really serious there is comedy and one of my favorite comic relef charecters\
is monzo the saw,he narrates the whole show in this tone thats like hes trying to be serious but you cant take him\
seriously and it ends up being very funny,the soundtrack is unique and is a mix or japanese rap and hip-hop,now i \
say unique because japanese rap is different from english but its still very good,the opening is good and has one of my \
favorite theme songs in anime,ok now sub or dub i liked the dub and only really watch the sub if i dont like the english \
voice acting,which i thought was pretty good,i did watch some of the sub but i liked the dub more.i give this anime a \
9 out of 10,i really enjoyed samurai champloo a lot and highly recommend it to anyone that likes action anime or liked \
cowboy bebop.\

    First things first. This is the best soundtrack for any form of media (be it anime or otherwise) that I have ever heard in my entire life. I was so sad to hear that the music producer (Jun Seba aka Nujabes) passed away. But the soundtrack is only the first of things I love about it. The story is unique, and interesting. I found myself so riveted in the characters that I cried.... a lot (sidenote: I'm a super easy crier). The story about the sunflower samurai really keeps things going, and all the adventures, and people they meet on the way add greatly to\
          \
        the overall suspense, especially during the climax. And I also greatly enjoy the episodes that add to the characters background. So, in short, it's a serious, suspenseful anime, with a very satisfying climax and falling action. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys anime (male and female alike!)\

    Samurai Champloo is a series that takes place in the Edo period of Japan and focuses on the story of three characters; Fuu: A tomboyish 15 year old girl with a knack for complaining, Jin: a silent super talented samurai that wears glasses with no reason and Mugen: A complete nutbag.\
Anyways, after Fuu helps the other 2 to escape their execution she convinces them to help her find \"The Samurai that smells like the sunflowers\" and so with the vaguest clue in the world, our heroes journey through feudal Japan to find this guy and kill a bunch of people in the way.\
While most episodes\
          \
        are unrelated to the central plot, they're still entertaining to watch by having the right mixture of humor, comedy and drama; and referencing some other mature stuff along the way, including religion. However it's not perfect, in early episodes some things happen without explanation and there is this episode relating a mushroom which doesn't make any freaking kind of sense! But in the end it's still an enjoyable journey and the characters have quite the chemistry that makes them very likeable.\
I also love the action in this anime, it's stylish but realistic and very exciting without feeling exaggerated (except for a couple occasions) and the Hip-Hop soundtrack always feels pitch-perfect even for being a series that takes place around the 19th Century when Hip-Hop wasn't even invented yet.\
Overall I liked this series a lot, and I can recommend it to anyone whether they like anime or not, it has a very \"Kill Bill-esque\" feeling to it!\

    Samurai Champloo\
First review yayyyy! So that being said cut me some slack. Im not going to make this too long and I will divide this review into a few sections including: 1) Story 2) Art/Animation 3) Sound 4) Character and then finally my overall feelings. Also I will not include any spoilers.\
First off I will say i decided to write my first review on Samurai Champloo as it is my favorite anime to date. My favorite musical artist is Nujabes so excuse me if I sound bias.\
Story\
Samurai Champloo is an episodic anime however, it does have a base story. While not very complex or intricate,\
          \
        the story works.This base story will show itself throughout some of the episodes but for the most part not until the final 3. This setup however works perfectly. Champloo is the perfect blend of action, comedy, and emotion. With topics ranging from baseball to graffiti to deadly assassins to beetle wrestling and more, the episodes are very diverse and are all enjoyable in their own way. Pacing is not much of an issue as each episode presents a new adventure or even some more insight to the key storyline. You will undoubtedly laugh, feel remorse, and be amazed throughout watching. \
Art/Animation\
Beautiful, absolutely beautiful is what I thought as watching. The setting is rural Japan and it feels very accurate as to what things looked like during the time period. During the day many bright and vivid colors are used bringing out the beautiful nature. Lighting is used very nicely as well. During the night very dark tones and shades are brought out and it feels very much like a painting some of the time. Urban art and style are also very prevalent throughout the series and it brings a fresher and more fun/relaxed feel to the series. \
Sound\
The music in Champloo always seems to be brought in at just the right time. Nujabes, Fat Jon, and The Forces Of Nature did a great job. Their instrumentals range from relaxing and cool to adding an intense and fast paced feel. The music is a key cog in what makes this series so great.\
Character\
The three main characters, Mugen, Jin, and Fuu. A delightful bunch who work very well together. Mugen is the typical rogue badass who doesnt follow rules or anybodys orders. A very likeable character and easy to understand. Jin on the other hand is the exact bipolar opposite of his counterpart. Jin is the calm and quiet master swordsman. It takes a bit to warm up to Jin but he also has his times where is extremely likable. He is the stabilizer to Mugen and Fuu's wild personalities. Fuu is the clueless broad who brings the group together. Always getting left behind and made fun of, Fuu is the epitome of a clueless teen girl.\
Overall\
To be honest I have watched Champloo anywhere from 6-9 times through and every time it does not get old. It is easy to re-watch with friends whom I recommend to. Every time I still find myself laughing, being amazed and just plain enjoying myself while watching. To this day even though its been many years, Champloo will always have a special place in my heart. Thanks for reading and I hope this was helpful!\

    Samurai Champloo is an interesting one. Being compared with Cowboy Bebop, and generally receiving praise regardless who I asked, I decided to watch it. I finished the anime over a weekend with a friend. My overall reaction? More or less disappointed.  \
The anime begins with the three protagonists of the anime meeting up, fighting each other, and then teaming up. The characters themselves are interesting enough, Jin being a more stereotypical samurai, Mugen more a 'badass' sort of samurai, and Fuu the typical hot girl who can't do anything except get kidnapped. And my, does she get kidnapped. \
The characters are interesting enough; the\
          \
        huge problem I had with this anime is its focus. Every single episode the 3 heroes found themselves simply doing the bidding of the town they happened to be in. Every single episode felt like a filler to me, simply because none of the plot being revealed had anything to do with the core plot. I just finished the anime thirty minutes ago, but I've already forgotten almost all the random towns they went to, all the random characters they met, all the random things they did. But who could blame me? I didn't bother remembering any of those character's names or their back stories because I knew by the next episode they would be forgotten by the anime itself. They were all simply wastes of time in order to kill the twenty minutes of the show. Sometimes the fillers would be split into two parters, but they failed to be any more than just fillers in the end. Sometimes the fillers would have characters killed or freed from a brothel, and I was expected to get sad at certain scenes. But how could I? I had only met the characters under twenty minutes ago. They were simply pawns used to get through the twenty minutes.\
People sometimes praise this anime's attempt to blend modern culture with the Edo period. I frown upon it, however. The beat boxing, the graffiti, Van Gogh, Christianity, Baseball, all those things were simply distractions trying to get me to forget that I was watching a boring samurai adaptation. In the end they had nothing to do with the core plot and were as quickly forgotten by the heroes as everything else that happened. In addition, the filler stories were extremely predictable, amounting to a simple formula of introduce evil organization that survives off evil, girl gets kidnapped, fight scene, victory, credits. It was so boring I couldn't believe it. Perhaps if the anime's story had been entirely about this evil organization, and the fight scene had been built up over great plot twists and character development, I might have given two shits about this organization. Unfortunately, they are introduced and are defeated in a little over twenty minutes, just like everything else in this anime.\
I commemorate this anime's many references to the age of the samurai; however, I refuse to believe that in that time period every single town was corrupt, every single town had gambling men, and every single woman was forced to work in a brothel because of debts. There was certainly more things in the Edo period than just brothels, yet this anime has more than then I can count on my fingers. \
I feel as if this anime didn't have to be this way. If there had just been more core plot, and the anime had leaked it better over all 26 episodes, I feel like the whole thing would have been better. For instance, spread the chrisitanity issue out over more episodes, have the characters run into the issue of christianity more times. It was very central to the core plot right? So use it more! Why should I have to watch so many pointless fight scenes where the two immortal heroes just defeat everybody they happen to meet on their journey? Also, why so few episodes on developing the two samurai's? Mugen got two or three episodes on his past, and Jin got something like four. In the end, I didn't learn enough. I wanted to learn more about the main characters, not some random events happening in random towns that our heroes just happened to get involved with.\

    Samurai Champloo is a modern influenced retelling of a later part of the Edo Period in Japan, but it's also not at all true to the Edo Period, so if you're going to watch it, don't expect a history lesson.\
The series uses anachronisms many times, but none that have much direct influence on the story itself.\
Samurai Champloo is in the same boat as Cowboy Bebop, another story by the same director, Shinichiro Watanabe. Both try to tell a story with elements of music mixed around into the series itself, Cowboy Bebop with rock and jazz elements and Samurai Champloo with Hip-Hop elements.\
Story: The story is\
          \
        good for the most part, although most of the series doesn't seem focused around the actual goal of the characters, they manage to pull it all together around the end and tie it up while still giving it a satisfying ending. \
While the episodes don't seem related to the main goal of the 3 main characters while you watch it, they all end up coming together near the end of the series, and the character development given in those episodes makes every second of the series worth the time you gave it.\
The series also knows when to take itself seriously and when to let loose, which makes the series all the more enjoyable.\
Art: The art is magnificent, and fits the series perfectly. The art compliments the hip-hop themes of the series and the fight scenes art is terrific, and even when it's just them walking along the scenery helps you take in the series for what it's worth.\
Music: The music is terrific, but what else could you expect from a series that is influenced around musical hip-hop themes? The opening, \"Battlecry\" by Nujabes, fits the theme of the series completely, and does what an opening is supposed to - make you want to watch the episode even more than you did before.\
Like I said before about the story, it knows when to take itself seriously and when to let loose, the music knows this as well. All in all, a very enjoyable soundtrack that captures the series.\
Characters: The characters are enjoyable to see and are one of the best I've seen in awhile.\
Mugen - A womanizing freelancer who has a criminal past following him. Mugen loves to fight and gets into a bunch of trouble because of this and has thousands of people searching for his head. As the series progresses, Mugen becomes less of a bloodthirsty hellhound and becomes more of a down-to-earth human being who is all around likable.\
Jin - A master of kendo and the apprentice of renowned swords master,  Mariya Enshirou. Jin is the \"Silent Hero\" archetype done correctly. While remaining silent for a good portion of the series, he also isn't always serious, and can joke around with Mugen and be lighthearted as well, while keeping within the boundaries of the \"Silent Hero\" archetype. Jin, like Mugen, becomes more of a down-to-earth human as the series progresses along.\
Fuu - A young waitress who is caught up in a battle between two masters of the sword. Fuu is a Damsel-in-Distress character, while still having a bit of dignity on her own. Fuu is a bit annoying at the start of the series, but by the middle like the other two, she starts to become a character you can like and relate to.\
In the end, all 3 of the main characters are enjoyable and likable.\
Voice Acting:  Having only watched the dub, I can't comment on the japanese voice acting. But, unlike a lot of other series, the dub does a fantastic job portraying the characters from episode 1 and on. The main characters have great voices, and the supporting cast is very good as well. In the end, the dubbed version was great and had very good casting choices.\
Overall: Overall, the series is very enjoyable and will leave you entertained from Episode 1 to Episode 26 without any breaks in between. The characters are engaging, the art is magnificent, and the voice acting and soundtracks fit both the tone of the story and the characters. This series is a series basically anyone can enjoy, I would recommend it to everyone.\

    Story:\
The story behind Samurai Champloo isn't very complex, but it works. There is a little bit more focus on individual episodes than the main plot most of the time; the main idea is never forgotten though.\
Art:\
The Art is cool; everything from old Japanese style paintings to graffiti art! Outstanding! It's a shame it was never in HD.\
Sound:\
I thought I'd dislike Samurai Champloo because I'm a Metalhead and its sound focuses on record scratching, but they used the sounds to good effect. It was amusing to say the least.\
Characters:\
Mugen and Jin are awesome. They both have epic sword skills. Mugen is a cut up and Jin\
          \
        is quiet. Both of them provide awesome fights and good jokes. Fuu isn't epic in any way, but the show would be nothing without her.\

    Samurai Champloo is certainly a consumate work of art. \
The three main characters are an unlikely bunch who seem just as likely to kill each other as to be each other's only allies in a hostile world. Samurai Champloo is a beautiful story about an unlikely alliance between 3 very different people. \
The show weaves music and history in to help keep the story solid and the episodes are usually 'seemingly' self-contained. What I mean by that is at the end of the episode there usually aren't cliff hanger or confusion about the immediate plot, but things that happen in the previous episodes come back\
          \
        to make a huge deal later in the show.\
Certainly one of my favorites. Especially the music and the depictions of foreigners.\
The story of friendship expressed is also really powerful. \
Oh, and lest I forget, the action is superior. \

    Before I type my review I just need to discern the three \"categories\" of anime as the way I see them.  There are \"serious\", funny, and fanservice.  Now if i'm reviewing a funny anime or a fan service anime I am rather lenient if not very lenient on grading each individual aspect of the show for obvious reasons.  But when i decide to watch a \"serious\" anime, that is one that wholeheartedly attempts to present a good, original, and well put together story/show then I have to grade with discrimination.  That being said for this anime I have very little to\
          \
        discriminate against, as it was just that good of a show for me.  Fair warning, I am writing this review a good year or so removed from watching the show so perhaps my exact memories aren't spot on. That being said every time i think back to this show I have nothing but fond memories.  The story itself felt fresh, original and deliberate, there were rarely any sharp left turns that detracted from the show and the pacing of each episode felt very appropriate.  Though in the end the main trio goes their separate ways, wistfulness doesn't stop me from appreciating how great the story was.  As far as art goes I would give it a 10/10 as it just plain and simple looks good.  But there's more to it than that.  There's the countless action sequences and well choreographed fight scenes that amplify the value of the art in this show.  You have a show where 2/3 of the main cast wield swords in two radically opposite manners and yet the show found a way to do justice to both!  That facet of the art alone would merit a 10 let alone the countless others that make this show stand out on a visual level!  I could write endlessly about the sound but basically Nujabes (may he rest in peace) is a genius.  His work in general is phenomenal but to use it throughout the show?  Of course the sound gets 10/10.  As I don't remember the specifics about each character to a T, I will say that this portion of my review might be lacking, but I maintain a score of 10 just because the characters were almost always well-fleshed out.  The main trio in particular was very well characterized, remaining dynamic throughout and development via story events and flashes into their respective pasts shed light into the nature of each character.  Combine all these factors and it's a natural result to give enjoyment 10/10 along with an overall score of 10.\

    This anime is freaking amazing. The fights are fantastically animated, the setting is a awesome blend of old and new, and the music is by Nujabes. That alone makes it super good. The format is semi-episodic. Theres a general storyline but many of the episodes can be watched without context. Many of the characters are pretty standard anime tropes (Jin for sure. Maybe mugen sorta but hes so cool that it doesnt matter), and theres not much plot development. For what youd think is a no-plot samurai action anime, sometimes it deals with pretty serious subject matter.\

        and the animation. trust me, its awesom.\

    First off, Samurai Champloo is most certainly my favorite anime of all time. It has everything: dope art, relatable characters, an AMAZING soundtrack, and lots more!  For starters, for those familiar with Shinichiro Watanabe's previous anime, \"Cowboy Bebop\", the main plot and the way it's dealt with will be welcome and comforting.  Like THAT series, Champloo doesn't focus on the central story for every one of its 26 episodes, but instead, sheds light on each misadventure at a time.  But, the way the central plotline is handled is masterful.  As for characters, Champloo truly has some of the best around! \
          \
        There are 3 protagonists: Mugen, a reckless guy whose fighting style is reminiscent of break-dancing; Jin, a stoic wandering samurai with a mysterious past; and Fuu, the cute, hapless waitress girl who drags the other two along with her on her quest to find \"the samurai who smells of sunflowers\".  All 3 characters are instantly likable and very human.  Now...SOUND...MY GOD the sounds!!!  The show is soundtracked by the likes of Tsutchie and Nujabes, and the funky sounds that they and others produced for this anime REALLY knock!  Overall, I found this anime incredibly enjoyable.\

    This series is for action lovers. You got 3 characters who are as different as night and day. Jin, an adult male, quiet, but cultured roni of exceptional skil. He strikes with blazing speed and precision(very deadly). Mugen, also an adult male, but is an \"in your face\", free spirited roughian. His style of sword fighting is more like Bruce Lee's wing chung, loose and flowing(very deadly). Fuu a young female teenager. She has some street savy, but still is naive to a lot of things in the adult world. She's the focal point of the story. Mugen an Jin accompanies her on her journey\
          \
        is probably the only reason these two haven't kill each other in the beginning. However as time passes, they become more like rival siblings, brothers, and true friends who care for Fuu. There travels have them(Jin & Mugen) showcase there awesome fighting skills in various fight scenes. The three also had a knack for getting into some strange but hilarious situations, example, a war being averted because a field of unknown plants caught fire and made everyone happy, happy. Too funny. All this done up to a hip hop theme music. The scenes and music choreography was exceptional. I still enjoy rewatching it, even if it's just for the laughs\

       I absolutely LOVE this anime. It's been around for a while so I decided to watch it before Netflix decided to kill my happiness. I was extremely impressed with this anime at first because I thought that an anime about ancient Japan with hip-hop was not exactly an amazing start but I couldn't have been anymore wrong. Thinking of Samurai Champloo with traditional music (which it does have some) just seems plain wrong after watching it. The entire show had the capability to be extremely serious and depressing to complete and utter goofiness all while never losing the viewers interest. \
         The characters grow on you with all of the adventures they go through and although I thought the character Fuu would be like any other \"damsel in distress\" anime character, she completely surprised me, giving a completely different view of her role in an anime. The two other main characters, Mugen and Jin, are also quite different from your everyday samurai (well, Mugen is anyway). A duo that are complete opposites of each other and mortal enemies make quite a good team, able to play off of each others strengths and weaknesses and generally kick ass. \
   The overall story was quite amazing and fresh but the ending was a bit disappointing to me but to any other normal person, it was great. The overall goal of finding the samurai who smelled of sunflowers seemed to be interesting but not only was slightly disappointing to me, but to someone else as well. That probably sounds confusing but if you've seen it, you know. And although the actual ending was everything a great, short anime should have, being the overall clingy viewer I was and am, wanted to see it continue. I thought it would have ended with a more adventuring tone but no. It just ends. None the less, this was a fantastic anime to me. I give it a 10 out of 10.\

    Samurai Champloo is a one of those shows were you don't have to see every episode and the first few episodes you'll be think is there any reason behind the story. However there are some very funny moments some involving accurate history details with some very completely non relevant items that don't fit the the time period.\
That said the main characters are very good Mugan I swear is borrowed from the samurai in Lupin the third. The artwork is amazing and overall you will find enjoyment from in most of the episodes as samurai manga/animes goes its not the best you'll find but has a\
          \
        style all of its own.\
You will find yourself liking the main characters and wish the story had more relevance rather than the  weak story line that guides the story to an ok ending.  So to sum up the artwork is good the story is poor for the most part but is worth watching.\

    This anime is one of many I have enjoyed.\
(SPOILERS)(not entirely though I left out some parts)\
Story: It's about this girl (Fuu) and two samurai (Jin and mugen) who after flipping a coin must accompany Fuu on a journey to find the samurai that smells of sunflowers, as the story goes along they run into numerous challenges, and question whether or not this sunflower samurai truly exists. At the end you truly do get to see the sunflower samurai, but he dies shortly after. After the long journey and seeing as how she can now freely go about her life, she continues hanging with Jin and\
          \
        Mugen. It was a good story, but not perfect, it had flaws.\
Art: The Artwork was good in my opinion it could have been better, but hey I am not complaining.\
Sound: The sound was good but I am not much for that type of music, although the beat box band was funny, lol.\
Characters: Mugen was arrogant, stubborn, and a straight up jackass, but was the cool guy of the series. Jin was calm, collective, and understanding of others. Fuu always got into trouble, was fat then randomly turn skinny again, kind, and funny. character design is very good to me.\
Enjoyment: I did enjoy this anime so, I will give it 7.\
Overall, I would recommend this.\

    *I originally posted this review on Anime-Planet*\
Critic's Log: Earthdate - June, 12, 2012. Review # 8: Samurai Champloo\
YO YO YO! Get your eyes ready! Keep it Steady! Because I have a review about Samurais and Hip Hop that is from the same guy that was directed Cowboy Bebop. I am white and nerdy and... You KNOW WHAT! I can't rap worth a damn, so let's pretend I never even started writing these written rap lyrics in the first place because... I think it was stupid from the beginning, so here's Samurai Champloo!\
In the Edo period. A young woman named Fuu is working at a tea\
          \
        shop. A band of samurais harass her and she ends up being saved by a mysterious vagrant rogue named Mugen and a young ronin named Jin. Mugen and Jin end up fighting eachother because Mugen sees Jin as a worthy fighter and there was one casualty due to the havoc in the tea shop. Mugen and Jin end up being arrested and the jobless and homeless Fuu decides to save Mugen and Jin from execution and requests them to join her in finding a \"samurai who smells of sunflowers\". Fuu also tells them that they cannot duel eachother until after Fuu finds this Samurai.\
To be technical, this anime was produced by Manglobe (a company that was formed by former Sunrise staff members) This was their first successful hit. This anime is also directed by Shinichiro Watanabe which most otakus know that he was the one behind Cowboy Bebop. this is also a tip of the hat for people that like Chanbara films (Sword-fighting samurai films), kinda how like Cowboy Bebop was a tip of the hat for people that like Science-fiction and Westerns.\
The animation definitely has great visuals and Watanabe-san has a good eye on how to portray these visuals when it most matters. The animation is not perfect however. There are some times when the animation does not look too great. The episode \"Elegy Of Entrapment (Verse 2)\" is one example. That's the only bad note I have with the animation. Here's the good stuff. The action scenes are mostly spectacular in Samurai Champloo. If the story is out of whack, the animation's zany moments sure do cover that up well. Hell, Beatbox Bandits had a scene full of trippy effects. I don't think the animation is hit and miss however because there are some episodes that have the animation looking bloody well.\
The soundtrack for Samurai Champloo is done by four people, Fat Jon, Force of Nature, Nujabes, and Tsutchie, all 4 of these guys didn't do a lot of musical scores from before or since. The opening is really cool in visuals and the theme really fits the visuals. May Nujabes Rap In Peace. The soundtrack for Samurai Champloo is pretty nice and contemplates the show for the most part, The strangest thing is that it works quite nicely, The average anime viewer that has tried it may wonder \"How does Hip-hop music fit in with a story about samurais with The Edo period as its setting?\" Now to think of it, Cowboy Bebop was a Sci-fi anime with western elements and Jazz music as it's main focus. Bebop's soundtrack is a gem, but Champloo's use of hip-hop may not make sense but the show is meant to be more entertaining and it is what it is. If you want to compare another samurai anime, look at Afro Samurai. It's about a Samurai, it has hip-hop music, Get the picture? There are a couple songs worth listening without the show but it is not too bad.\
*wiki wika*\
This show may also give you the impression that this show is more appropriate Subtitled, but Champloo is rich in Japanese Culture and is mixed in with Western Slang, hell... The New York Yankees are sort of in this show, so watching this in English wouldn't hurt either because both The Subbed Version and The Dubbed Version is excellent here. Kazuya Nakai and Steve Blum both make Mugen sound badass, Ginpei Sato and Kirk Thornton both make Jin calm and collected with some slight differences on vocal tones, Ayako Kawasumi and Kari Wahlgren are great as Fuu. It all comes down to personal preference.\
If there is one major problem with Samurai Champloo... It is that Mugen, Jin, and Fuu don't really develop too much even though there was some development right in the middle of the show and in the 3 part finale. Then again, The show was probably made for fun since the setting and story was already hackneyed after a while. Watanabe-san probably wanted to use the same episodic approach from Bebop. There are some interesting ideas in Samurai Champloo but it is not as thought provoking as most of the episodes from Cowboy Bebop.  This is one of the flaws I see with the show and...Frankly, my reader, most people don't give a damn... because this show has some kickass action scenes, if that is all you want in an action anime. This show will not disappoint you for the most part.\
*wiki wika*\
Samurai Champloo used to be available by Geneon, it has been rescued by Funimation and is currently available. There is a manga adaptation of Samurai Champloo but it's not really necessary to read if you already have seen the show, only 2 volumes of the manga were made and there really wasn't a ending to it.\
With that said, Samurai Champloo is a fun series that is a bit over the top in some of it's action scenes, humor, and some of the episodes. It is a blast to see it with friends. It also has a couple nods to its elder cousin Cowboy Bebop.\
I give Samurai Champloo a 7.8 out of 10, It is GOOD!\
Feel free to leave a comment, and if you want to start breakdancing. GO RIGHT AHEAD! Just don't kill yourself over it.\

where can you go wrong, or rather, that is the only show who can combine such elements and never go wrong\

A HUGE flaw on the director's part, regrettably it could have gotten the anime way much higher if it remained with awesome swordplay and (REALISTIC) endings \
all in all it was not so bad, i highyl recommend this series to any sword-slashing fan out there \

    Fuu, Mugen and Jin are all brought together by a series of events and Fuu saves their lives, Mugen and Jin decide to accompany Fuu on a journey to find the \"samurai who smells of sunflower\". What follows is an adventure across 26 episodes that pits the 3 against new obstacles, meeting new people, and surviving as best they can in their search for the \"samurai who smells of sunflowers\". The setting is in the Edo-era of Japan where Mugen and Jin are both samurai from different backgrounds. Mugen is carefree and brash while Jin is composed and disciplined. The two clash right from the\

        beginning and are at each others throats throughout their journey, only refraining from killing each other until after they find the \"samurai who smells of sunflowers\". The characters themselves are very intriguing, as their stories unfold throughout the series and helps you understand why they are alone from the start. The series is humorous, stemming from the characters and the situations they get stuck in. The action is very exciting as Jin and Mugen are both talented samurai who have  different styles but are equally matched. The music is rather hip hop and jazzy, which makes fun to listen to. The art is very well done and fits the theme of the series. The story is entertaining to watch, as you watch the 3 characters on their journey, each episode becomes more entertaining than the last. Overall its a great series, definitely underrated and deserves a look. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.\

    Let first start by saying this that THE JAPANESE DUBBING SUCKS BIG TIME !! & THE ENGLISH DUBBING IS THE BEST !! for this anime. It maybe the only anime i know where the original Japanese dubbing is so bad that it completely kills the fun. I think this is the MAIN reason why this anime does not have the top 5 spot in the Rating List !! Because Most anime watchers including me find the original Japanese dubbing better than the English almost 98% of the time when we watch. But this anime is an exception.  PLEASE WATCH THIS ANIME IN ENGLISH DUBBING\
          \
        TO SEE WHAT MASTERPIECE IT IS !!\
The story is nothing special and also has some small almost negligible holes in it. BUT !! this anime makes up for the lack of story with EVERYTHING ELSE !! Infact i think this is a Masterpiece exactly for this reason.\
Even without a good story and being episodic (a main story keeps continuing through the shadows of each episode), this anime is so memorable. Each and every episode is unique, hardly any story but still some episodes will end up reaching your heart with strong hard hitting emotions, some will make you laugh and fall off your chair and others will make your adrenal rush !!\
1. There are no cliches. \
2. Best fluid movements your will ever see in sword fight animation. This  \
fights a treat for the eyes.\
3. Some of the best intelligent comedy i have ever seen.\
4. Portrays very realistic human emotions with depth and precision. It can hit hard.\
5. Unique and very stylish Art.\
THIS ANIME HAS NO CLICHES WHATSOEVER !!\
THIS ANIME IS EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT AND STYLISH !! \
THIS ANIME IS EXTREMELY RE-WATCHABLE !! ( I am the kind of person who easily gets bored, and i do not remember ever re-watching any anime  before, but this was the only one i have watched like 3 times now.)\
I Do not remember ever to get so addicted to an anime's opening and ending's music before. Yes this is the only anime who's opening and closing track i have listened again and again.\
This anime deserves a top 10 spot. Please recommend your friends to watch it. Increase its fan base. I am a kind of person who has watched the elite anime like Steins Gate, FMAB, Baccano etc. So ya i know what i am talking about. Infact i have watched so many good anime already, that i am going through a very hard dry time, most of the anime feels like crap to me and i can hardly watch anything :( \

 Jin is a mild-mannered vagrant ronin who carries himself in the conventionally stoic manner of a samurai of the Tokugawa era. Using his waist-strung daishou, he fights in the traditional kenjutsu style of a samurai trained in a prominent, sanctioned dojo. \
 \
 Jin wears glasses, an available but uncommon accessory in Edo era Japan. Jin seldom talks and Fuu seems to prefer him to Mugen. He is reputed to have killed his dojo master and his history is shrouded in mystery.\

  synopsis = "Fuu Kasumi is a young and clumsy waitress who spends her days peacefully working in a small teahouse. That is, until she accidentally spills a drink all over one of her customers! With a group of samurai now incessantly harassing her, Fuu desperately calls upon another samurai in the shop, Mugen, who quickly defeats them with his wild fighting technique, utilizing movements reminiscent to that of breakdancing. Unfortunately, Mugen decides to pick a fight with the unwilling ronin Jin, who wields a more precise and traditional style of swordfighting, and the latter proves to be a formidable opponent. The only problem is, they end up destroying the entire shop as well as accidentally killing the local magistrate's son. For their crime, the two samurai are captured and set to be executed. However, they are rescued by Fuu, who hires the duo as her bodyguards. Though she no longer has a place to return to, the former waitress wishes to find a certain samurai who smells of sunflowers and enlists the help of the now exonerated pair to do so. Despite initially disapproving of this idea, the two eventually agree to assist the girl in her quest; thus, the trio embark upon an adventure to find this mysterious warrior—that is, if Fuu can keep Mugen and Jin from killing each other. Set in an alternate Edo Period of Japan, Samurai Champloo follows the journey of these three eccentric individuals in an epic quest full of action, comedy, and dynamic sword fighting, all set to the beat of a unique hip-hop infused soundtrack.
