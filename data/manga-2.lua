    Story - 9.38\
The first three volumes may discourage some of the readers because it's starts off kind of slow and the initial artwork is not quite up to today's standards. However, after the reader begins the Golden Age arc it is nearly impossible to not be pulled in and become addicted to the series. It is chock-full of action, drama, character development, twists and turns, and just a dash of romance. It defies generalization and is just damn good storytelling.\
After the Gold Age arc wraps up the story come back full circle to where it left us at the end of volume 3. But by\
          \
        then the rhythm of the manga has changed completely. The reader has established a deep connection with Guts, Casca, and Griffith and that only grows more as the story continues. You'll be confronted with conflicting emotions and think things like 'I really want to see Guts put Griffith in the ground' and at the same time 'Griffith is just so damn cool'. These conflicting thoughts and emotions just go to show how invested the reader becomes with the characters.\
Another good thing about the Berserk story is that the protagonist (Guts) is not always the focal character in every chapter. In fact, nearly all of the major supporting cast members receive a considerable amount of page space for their own stories to be fleshed out. Each of these side-stories is not only unique and extremely well developed, but also very deep and revealing as it shows the reader why these character are the way they are. One of the side stories that I found most intriguing was Farnese and Serpico's as it was so beautifully orchestrated as part of the manga as a whole.\
The only problem with the story, in my humble opinion, is the introduction of magic in the manga. I feel that the magic the group 'acquires' in volume 24 is somewhat exaggerated and does not suit the dark atmosphere of the story. In fact, at times it can even make some of the chapters feel a bit shounen-esk. But even still, it's pretty much impossible not to enjoy the ongoing story that is Berserk.\
\
Art - 9.6\
The artwork in the first few volumes of Berserk won't do much to impress many of today's manga readers, but at the time when the series was first serialized (1992) it was certainly well above average. Those initial volumes feature many very unique character designs (especially the apostles) and also sport a relatively high focus on detail. However, where Miura really shows off his latent artistic talents early on is through his ability to create crisp, clear, and highly fluid fight scenes.\
One of the few negative aspects of the early volumes can be identified as the simple shading techniques that Miura used. Also, sometimes the character faces will look just a bit 'off' and it can be a little distracting. However, these minor quality issues were most likely due to the time constraints that were in place at the time and not entirely the fault of the artist.\
Then as the series progresses the reader gets to watch the artwork literally evolve. As we learn more and more about the characters and the world in which they live, the characters themselves and their environments become more and more visually detailed. The simple shading from the early volumes is eventually replaced by a hand shading technique which gives the series a more gritty and surreal overall feeling. The character designs become more crisp and facial expressions sometimes are so vivid that one look at a character's face is often enough to tell the reader exactly what the character is thinking. By the time the reader makes it into volumes 20 and beyond Miura has made it very clear that he means for Berserk to be truly regarded as a work of art just as much as it is a masterfully epic piece of storytelling.\
In my own experience I have seen very, very few other manga series that can even approach Berserk's later volumes on an artistic level and, unfortunately, I highly doubt that I will ever be able to find its peer.\
\
Characters - 9.5\
The very first character you will meet in Berserk is Guts, the 'Black Swordsman' with a dark past and a score to settle with his demonic enemies. Certainly not a very revolutionary character at first glance, but even though he may start off as such, his character quickly expands, and ends up as one of the most believable and human characters I have ever witnessed.\
As the story unwinds, you follow Guts through his past, allowing you to experience his personality change during his constant battle against fate. You follow Guts through waves of despair and hardships offset only by the flickering fires of friendship and trust. Eventually, Guts becomes like a maelstrom of opposing emotions, and the question arises, will he continue on his path of all-consuming revenge even if it means losing everything he has come to care for?\
The other characters that appear throughout the course of the story come in all different shapes and sizes and all play their roles perfectly, just as support characters should. The more important support characters, protagonists and antagonists alike, are all draped in many layers of depth, making their characters both solid pillars and interesting ingredients within the plot as a whole. From Griffith's burning ambition to the skulduggery of the God Hand, from Puck and Isidro's antics to Farnese's troubled past and uncertain future, the characters all appear vivid and alive (Although alive might not fit The Skull Knight...) and all have their own emotions, personalities and ambitions. The supportive cast show their brilliance in how they appear to the reader as actual players in Berserk's grand game, and not just as passive plot devices.\
With such a cast of strong personalities and vibrant, living characters, Berserk easily cuts it's way (no pun intended) to the top score in this category.\
\
Enjoyment - 10\
The fact that I sat and read through all 295 chapters of this exquisite manga in one sitting should justify the perfect score for enjoyment! The manga has great characters - heroes you root for and empathize with, villains you can't help but admire for their ruthlessness and charisma. The artwork is dark, brooding, and gruesome and complements the story well. And what a riveting story it is... It hooks you from the first chapter and sets the stage for the most intriguing revenge themed manga on the market. Its success is testament to its quality. My only complaint is the excruciating waits between chapters.\
Also, I must throw in a cautionary note: this manga is quite definitely not for the faint hearted. There is a considerable amount nudity, sex, gore, violence, and, for the lack of a better word, bad-assery!\

When I first learned that there is\
          \
        something like Berserk manga, I was a bit surprised. That was some 7 years ago and little did I know about relations between anime and manga. Either way, I took my chances and downloaded several first volumes. \
You can imagine my surprise when I noticed that the manga is a far cry from the anime which really made my day some time ago. Having struggled through the first chapters I moved on to the next volumes. You know, the anime itself is, in all its ingenuity, only a small fraction of the whole manga... As small as several volumes with some deleted scenes and a bit redone ending at that. However, by the moment I reached 'the anime plotline' in manga (which is volume 3) I got already interested in the manga itself. \
I think that there's no point in summarising the plot. You can read it above, and for the sake of not spoiling anything, I think you should. You have to, however know this: Berserk manga, in terms of plotline and characters development - is by far the best manga I have ever read, the most complete one, the most multi-dimensional one, the most memorable one... Nowhere else will you be told the stories of sub characters so bluntly and yet discreet that you won't even notice. Nowhere else will you receive such a huge dose of information, and yet still be able to comprehend it effortlessly. This is something uncanny, and frankly, I doubt that anyone ever will be able to reach the level.\
The characters are just great. On one hand we have Gutts and Griffith, shades of black and white, fire and water. Being so different, neither can live without the other one. They're like Yin and Yang, two halves of the same coin - even in his darkest moments Griffith still finds himself as Gutts' friend, although few minutes later this friendship changes into hatred and horrific envy. Their whole story is like that, they start off as great friends who would die for each other with smiling face, but only one of them is really committed here.\
Characters shine even more when we consider other protagonists and antagonists. No person is left shallow and without a story to tell. Miura-sempai explains everything in a given time and briefly enough to keep you interested. Unlike in other titles where antagonists exist only to serve as a powerup training bag for the protagonist, here all demons have their motives. Even the smallest monster is explained, by which you get attached, even to such scumbags.\
The story itself is brutal, broody and hectic sometimes. But you never really lose the track if it. You can have two mini-arcs in one mayor arc, but you'll always remember what the team's real destination is. In this way, Miura-sempai makes it clear to you, that Gutts, although a little less passionately, follows his path and even if he was to be destroyed, he would neither falter nor go back. And the same goes for Griffith, who despite his appearance (nowhere else will you notice that appearance is deceitful so much as in Berserk) is a very strong-willed and straight-forward character. And in all this, having seen all the atrocities that happen in Midland, you never ever think of Griffith as the wrong one. He's not wrong, he's just following his dream, a dream that was clouded with Gutts appearance in his life.\
The art itself, is a state of art to watch and read. Detailed panels, hundreds of characters on one page during a hectic battle, highly textured monsters and what I love the most - fluid, realistic and clear fighting scenes. You don't need Kubo trolling with ink to see that Gutts has his speed even despite the weight of his sword. You don't need hundreds of straight lines to increase the dynamics of the scene - Miura-sensei  manages it all without a loss in quality.\
Facial expressions are something completely else. Even if you cannot follow the plot for some weird reason you can always judge whether the character is good or bad by just looking at his or her face. Those are very detailed and so rich in expressions that you never get bored. You can feel the difference between smooth and angelic appearance of Griffith and a brute, yet kind rectangular face of Gutts.\
The mangaka puts a lot of effort into shade and light in Berserk. By that we get a very distinctive nights, sunshines and sunsets as well as dynamic shadows (however awkward it sounds) that no anime director can mime. It's simply sensational to look at all that and even be able to read the story of it... It is clear to me, that Miura-sensei is trying to end up with a sort of masterpiece in terms of manga. And you know what? He's pretty close to achieving this.\
There are, however, some bad points too. The manga is not for everyone. I would strictly add parental advisory and 18+ to it. Nowhere else will you see so much nudity, sex and violence as in this manga. It's not a hentai-like nudity and sex though. Berserk shows a violent world with all its aspects, hence these parts were as relevant as any other to make the story as believable as possible.\
I'm glad I was able to read the manga. It's one of the best titles ever, if not the best so far. I sincerely hope though, that Miura-sensei lives up to the expectations and finishes this story in a fitting way. Judging by his up-to-date work, it's more than possible.\

    This series already gets plenty of praise, so I will mostly focus on criticism for this review, despite the fact that I do have plenty of positive things to say about Berserk. I want to make a review that will be legitimately helpful to people, rather than simply echoing the beliefs of every other reviewer on here. Look at the myriad \"10\" reviews for raving about how amazing it is, there is plenty of that already. This series does not get nearly enough proper criticism. Or it's just that critique and anything vaguely negative mentioned about Berserk and its supposed perfection (this praise largely stems\
          \
        from a single arc) is quickly buried by hordes of screaming fanboys. Please read the whole thing before marking the review \"helpful\" or \"not helpful.\" Because if you don't finish it then you don't really know, do you?\
The first flaw that is quickly apparent is in the first three volumes, or is simply the first three volumes in their entirety. They are a tad cliché and they follow our beloved lone wolf anti-hero and his elf buddy (comic relief sidekick who also heals out of convenience to the plot) on a couple adventures. The villains are cliché, everything is kind of cliché, the art is nothing special (yet), and it seems sort of generic. Not the best exposition to any series. This would have been best moved into chronological order. \
The true glaring issue here is that, after this, there is a lengthy flashback/reverse-time-skip that lasts around 11 volumes and is called the \"Golden Age\" arc. This arc will now be called the \"GA\" arc because typing on my iPhone is inconvenient. It is easily and widely acknowledged as the best part of the series, to the point where people dub berserk the greatest manga of all time simply because of this one arc, but it is still seriously held back by the first three volumes. \
The conclusion of the astounding GA arc is one of the most intense and emotionally impactful scenes in manga and it would have been, additionally, one of the most unexpected, but we already knew it would happen, due to the first three volumes, which greatly lessened the impact. It was a great scene, but it could have been even better and had an even greater effect on me as a reader. I would not have seen it coming if not for the first three volumes, despite some masterful foreshadowing within the GA arc itself. There was a marked lack of foresight shown in the first three volumes. It seems like Miura was trying to show how everything built up to the situation in the first three volumes, but by the time I finished the GA arc, I really didn't care about the first three volumes anymore. I could nitpick some elements of the GA arc, but it's so superior to the rest of the series that I won't even bother.\
The art slowly became some of the best and most detailed art in manga, but it was also often used as a crutch after the GA arc. The misty valley arc is the earliest example of this. The image of the \"elves\" slaughtering each other and \"playing human\" was one of the most brutal in the series, and it may fit in thematically, but the arc lacks overall significance and character development, especially considering its length. It would have established Guts's personality after the GA arc and how he had changed, but we already knew from the first three volumes. It was also the perfect opportunity to turn Puck into something more than a pointless comic relief character that we've seen a million times before, but that potential was quickly squandered as well, and Puck's character never really develops beyond a comic relieving plot device.\
Guts's showdown with the evil apostle fairy chick foreshadowed a descent into fights that are shounenesque in both verbosity and length, a serious depart from the gritty fantasy realism that the series is so often praised for. The realism further deteriorated as it went on, proportionally to the increase of clear shounen elements. Guts gathered a crew à la one piece, an inexplicable depart from his character, including an uninteresting masochist, a loli witch, and a motherfucking veritable shounen protagonist. The loli witch was one of the worst things to happen to the series. The thief kid/shounen protagonist was another one of the worst. I have no idea what Miura was thinking there. \
The masochist chick was actually quite an interesting character before she fell in love with Guts and started rolling with his crew. She was a powerful reflection of the pervading theme of masochism that usually manifests itself in the oft depicted self-destructive nature of humanity. Now she's the epitome of cliché. She shows some promise of recovery, but at the pace the plot is moving that will likely be in the distant future. The women are all in love with Guts by the way. No shounen is complete without a harem of women who exist to make the protagonist look cooler.\
The Skull Knight was another promising character, but it's been a while since we've seen him, he appears infrequently anyway, and having next to nothing known about him, after all this time, is simply bad writing. There has been some fairly obvious clues regarding his identity and origin, but there has been no true follow up on that, and we still know very little about him as a character. He's only existed to make a couple of convenient actions and philosophize about Guts's fate. Therefore, he too, has been reduced to more of a plot device than an actual character. There is also a possible major contradiction in his backstory, but I can't get into it without spoilers and I suppose it could still be explained somewhere down the road.\
Magic was introduced along with the witch and the crew gained shounenesque (I'm using this word a lot) power ups and thus realism went entirely out the window. Guts got a power-up that was reminiscent of Sasuke's curse mark early in the Naruto series. The theme of camaraderie is more omnipresent and becomes more about the \"power of friendship,\" harem elements develop, the ruthlessness is reduced, there is a moe loli witch, there is now campy abilities and gimmicks, there is shitty power-ups, there is in-battle commentary by secondary characters, battles are often increasingly drawn out, yesterday's enemies are today's friends, characters announce special moves when they are preformed, the general purpose becomes a noble fight against the very idea of evil, there is a general saturation of overused clichés and tropes, and there was even a slapstick comedy fanservice shower scene. Yup, berserk is undeniably in an increasingly noticeable downward spiral into battle shounen territory. Many fans deny this, but they are, well, in denial. This is sort of funny seeing as so many Berserk fans are pseudo-elitists who hate on popular battle shounens. It may be more explicit than a typical shounen series, but that superficial aspect of it does not grant it any sort of inherent maturity.\
Now, the mangaka clearly has no idea of what to do with the story. It's been ongoing for over twenty years and the story isn't close to being done; it is moving at a snail's pace, both on the rate at which it's released and the actual speed of plot development. It has been a half a year since the last chapter came out. Recently there was an arc where the motley crew nobly fights off a sea god/kraken thingy and mermaids are somehow involved. And they actually teamed up with comic relief pirates. My one piece comparisons are getting more accurate. Now, exactly what was the point of this arc? No one knows, but it sure as fuck isn't the fucking elf island that they've been trying to get to for over 10 fucking volumes. Fuck... He's clearly stalling because he's out of ideas. The dude does have serious myopia and a strange method of storytelling. He once decided that a published chapter of Berserk didn’t count because it gave too much information and insisted that it never be printed again. Seriously. If you’re putting that little thought into what you publish and how it will affect future chapters, that’s a problem. These 18 pages introduced a huge concept (although they didn’t go into great depth about it) that has yet to be seen again, even over 200 chapters later. Ummm, maybe you should have just kept the chapter after all? \
Despite my criticisms, the GA arc is a tragedy of epic proportions and it is a must read for any manga fan. There is a reason that this is the highest ranked manga on MAL. It has extraordinarily wide appeal and some very good qualities, despite it often falling into the \"sex and violence=depth\" trap. \
Make no mistake, I may compare it to shounens, but it is still far superior to shit like Naruto; you won't hear the word nakama being tossed around, although similar themes of companionship are increasingly echoed in a more subtle manner, and, unlike the worthlessly lazy Tite Kubo, Kentaro Miura puts an incredible amount of effort in his artwork. Although he made many mistakes in the plot, his artwork is indisputably among the best in later volumes. I've seen maybe one or two mangaka that come close or are on the same level. \
Guts is a powerful and tragic character and Griffith and Casca are compelling, until something happens to Casca, which kills her value as a character, and reduces her to a plot device for the majority of the series. One of the early themes of Berserk was how every man had his own dreams and motivations and, at least during the GA arc, it showed. All of the characters were detailed and had their own emotions. You could make an argument that, at that point, not a single character was a one dimensional plot device. \
Later on we get Guts's aforementioned posse, plus at least three or four comic relief characters with no depth to speak of, or higher purpose to serve in the storyline. I'd say that Guts and Femto are the only true quality characters, as it stands right now.. The fact that I still have sympathy for Femto after all that he did, really drives in what a great and multi-faceted character he is, his character is full of symbolism, and his rivalry with Guts is incredible.\
The antagonists have become less convincing over time. Despite interesting theories about and the philosophical nature of Void, and despite the fact that they all have awesome character designs, only one of the God Hand members is truly developed and compelling. One of them has only really existed for fanservice. Did I mention that berserk is actually pretty big on fanservice? Shit, Conrad isn't even good for fanservice, the Majin Buddha lookin fat fuck. Conrad's \"personality\" section in the Berserk Wikia is blank for a reason. He just kinda floats there while everybody else does all the hard work. \
And don't even get me started on Ubik. There's a reason his Berserk Wikia page doesn't even have a personality section. And at least Conrad made that big rock hand thing during the eclipse, this tentacle-ass motherfucker does absolutely nothing at all. What does Ubik even bring to the table? They oughta fire him or something..... Femto is an incredible and complex character that is the perfect foil to Guts while paralleling him in many ways. I don't expect all of the God Hand to be that, but at least give us something.\
I rate highly on conclusions as well as expositions, and from the looks of it, this series will have a very bad conclusion, or not have one at all. The climaxes of the series were often vastly epic, although the arguable biggest climax was pretty early on and the story never reached that height again in terms of intensity or quality, but the exposition was sub-par to say the least, and we'll have to see about the conclusion, but I'm not too hopeful. The GA arc is kind of rendered pointless if the overall series fails to deliver on its promise and delivers a lackluster conclusion. That's just speculation though. He may pull it off yet. But, at the pace he’s going, I seriously doubt it.\

Actually a very good rating, considering this was a mostly critical review. I just felt like the series wasn't getting properly called out on its flaws, although I like it. The fact is that it's far from perfect and I believe my \"7\" rating is a somewhat generous one, inflated due to nostalgia and other similar biases. \
In addition, the GA arc is simply too amazing for me to give the series anything below \"good.\"  That arc will stay with me forever and I've read it around 7 times. Too bad the mindless fanboys will not consider any of this and will simply click \"not helpful\" without reading the review, despite the fact that \"7\" is a positive score. On the other hand, haters may deem \"7\" to be too high a score and they will be butthurt as well. Well, I said what I had to say and I stand by it.",

    Berserk: best manga of all the time or GREATEST manga ever? This isn't up for debate, its written in stone. \
The story is incredible in every way imaginable. It starts out with a few small arcs featuring the Black Swordsman named Guts who hunts down demons known as Apostles. We aren't really sure why he does this at the beginning but the mangaka, Miura indicates that there is a lot of history between Guts and these Apostles. The setting is realistic fantasy at first with dashes of supernatural and high-fantasy elements sprinkled here and there. Guts doesn't appear as a very likable protagonist at first.\
          \
        He's rude, cynical, wooden and somewhat insane. The only definite characters are him and his elf sidekick, Puck. There is definitely a strong sense of mystery at first with Guts' motives being hinted at very subtlety as he makes his way through these self-contained arcs. There are no real characters that one can attach themselves to and the tone is extremely bleak. Themes such as existentialism are brought up quite often as the audience wonders why Guts continues at what seems to be a hopeless goal. Its eventually revealed that he has a personal vendetta against one of the God-Hands named Femto, one of the 5 deities of the Berserk universe. \
As soon as this is revealed, the manga goes into a very long flashback of Guts' entire life up to the present. It explains how he joined a mercenary group called The Band of the Hawk and became friends with the leader, Griffith. We see that Guts' enjoyed his life with the Band, and was friends with many of the mercenaries. Themes such as comradeship, identity and love are brought up which is stark contrast with the themes in the present. While reading all this, there is a nagging sensation that the audience hears at the back of their heads: this can't last. Miura skillfully throws in elements into the story and brings them up again much later. Its all masterfully weaved together, and as the past starts to catch up with the present, you can't help but dread the outcome of it all. And finally when the Eclipse rolls around, all sorts of emotions surge up such as sorrow and anger. It all comes full circle when the audience realizes that it was foreshadowed since day 1. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what we call masterful storytelling, and the best part is that its only one-third of the story. Truth be told, the manga could have ended after volume 13 and it would still be spectacular but Miura goes the extra several miles and turns Berserk in the stuff of legends. \
The characters in Berserk are phenomenal and are expertly written. Many characters undergo vast changes, and it all feels natural and not forced at all. Despite how they all appear at first, you can't help but come to like them all, shortcomings and flaws be damned. Guts becomes one of the best protagonists after a while, a true tragic hero in every meaning of the phrase. It really is a pleasure just to see all the characters interact and to see all their quirks. A chapter can be filled with nothing but dialogue and exposition, and it will be every bit as interesting and compelling as the action-packed chapters. The characters and story go hand in hand, they are all products of their environment and fit so well with the setting. All the fantastical elements fit just as well if not better. Berserk doesn't really require that much suspense of disbelief at first but once you get into it, it doesn't really matter what it pulls, it all seems possible and the sky is limit. \
The art is easily some of the best I've ever seen in a manga. The level of detail in the drawings is absolutely insane, everything looks so good. Characters all look great and have their own style and flavor. Faces are never recycled and even background characters all have a distinct look from each other. One of my favorite parts of the drawings are the eyes, their not overtly huge like in most anime and manga, but have a unique design that fits the characters well. Its not ultra realistic like Vagabond or Blade of the Immortal, yet the artstyle it sports is just as good if not better.  \
Overall, Berserk is easily the best manga I have ever read. From its well developed and written characters to its deep and intricate plot. There's loads of action, blood, gore, nudity, violence, horrific monster designs and I love every bit of it. Truth is all the extreme elements of this manga simply play second fiddle to the characters and story. There is no manga out there that has captivated me like Berserk, it has no equal. I don't even need to read every manga in existence to tell you that. You could take it as fanboy rambling, but I'm not kidding you when I say Berserk is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. If you have the time to read this review, than you sure as hell have enough time to open a new tab and read the first few chapters of Berserk. You won't regret it!\

     A 10. One of the several few mangas that deserve two numbers. Berserk tells the tale of a swordsman haunted by woe and bad luck.'Out of the frying pan into the fire' seems to be the only way to describe this manga, for the protagonist, Gutts, always seems to find himself in worse situations than those of his preceding situations.\
The storyline line is superb - one of money, love, betrayal, and death. Each of these themes seem to be ubiquitous yet vacant throughout the story. Albeit a bit slow in the beginning, the plot rockets off, forming a most complex and elaborate tale that\
          \
        is sure to suck you in like a vacuum.\
The art is amazing as well, though a tad bit confusing at times (as is the case for most action manga). The decapitation and maiming seem to look somewhat authentic relative to the weapon swings and cleaves - a huge plus in my book.\
The characters are all fascinating in their own respect. Some big, some young, yet all adventurous and brave enough to fit in such an epic story. Each character is introduced  and then reintroduced at a later time with even more background information on them.\
Lastly, the mangaka seems to do things differently in this manga then in others. This thing seems to be the 'pragmatist POV,' the POV any sensible person would take. This made me elated. If you don't know what I'm talking about, read and find out.\

STORY: 6/10\
Berserk starts off very poorly. A man with a ten foot sword and a robot arm kills a bunch of people and some gross looking monsters. Now I like gore just as much as the next guy, but there needs to be SOME sort of story or reasoning behind it. It seemed like the main character, Guts, just walked around and killed ugly things for the first few volumes just because he liked being covered in blood.\
But then the golden age arc started...This my friends, is one of the\
          \
        greatest arcs in manga history. It almost feels like the mangaka walked away from his desk and let God himself write this part of the story. The characters become deep, the disgusting fights gain meaning, and basically everything is executed to perfection. Then, after about a hundred chapters, it ends. God gives the pen back to the original mangaka and he proceeds to make Guts kill billions of ugly snake penis monsters for the next few hundred chapters. 25% of this manga is pure gold. The other 75% is utter shit.\
ART: 10/10\
Berserk's strongest point, aside from the golden age arc, has to be its art work. I believe I mentioned disgusting monsters a few times in the first paragraph and trust me - they are DISGUSTING. They've got rows of razor sharp teeth, they're covered in dirty fur, they're oozing with slime, they're drooling, and they all have snakes for penises. The amount of detail put into these beasts can make you hurl...but in a good way. This manga provides a few debatable subjects, but its artwork isn't one of them. It is nothing less than perfect.\
CHARACTER: 7/10\
The rivalry between Guts and Griffith is legendary. During the golden age arc both characters are given ample development time in order for the reader to truly feel for these guys. In fact, most of the characters from the golden age arc are given enough face time for people to get attached to them. Unfortunately, all the non-golden age arc parts of the manga have minimal development for the male characters aside from Guts, and most of the female characters are rape-bait. The golden age arc was so good though, that I'm going to give characters a higher score than it truly deserves. Seriously, most of this manga is bad.\
ENJOYMENT: 3/10\
Just so we're clear, golden age arc enjoyment = 10. The rest of Berserk is literally the same thing over and over again just with different ugly monsters. Here is a brief rundown of every chapter of Berserk: \
Guts walks into a city.\
Mutant panda bears are raping 900 women with their snake penises.\
Guts kills the panda bears with his man-sized sword.\
Everything is depressing.\
End.\
OVERALL: 6/10\
Drop it after the golden age arc. It doesn't just go downhill after that. It falls off a cliff and lands in a pile of dog shit barf...with snake penises.\

    Mod Note: This review was initially posted for the one-shot, Berserk Prototype, and was subsequently merged into Berserk.I've only recently started reading Berserk, so I've decided to check out the Prototype. I think that anyone who enjoys reading Berserk will find this interesting and worth reading. In itself it does not stand out particularly, and it really looks like another chapter of Berserk with some differences concerning the details of the story. (There are slight defferences in the treminology, and Guts is somewhat differently drawn.)\
I found it worth while because it actually shows you that a rough idea needs to be refined and thought through\
          \
        to bring about something as good as Berserk is. I've read some mangas that were potentially great, but seemed to lack that period that the author of Berserk took to think things through between the idea and its actual realization.\
So if you like Berserk, and if you're interested in the origins of the manga, you should definitely read the Prototype.\

    I don't consider myself to be much of a contrarian, so it is with little pleasure that I add this score to one of the highest rated series on this website. \
I think Berserk is GROTESQUELY overrated, pointless misery porn with some very nice illustrations. The violence is hideously over the top, the worst of which is reserved specifically for its female characters, the sheer darkness of the setting mutes any of the story's supposed triumphs, and as far as I'm concerned you lose any potential allegorical worth to the brutality of the real world when you have demon rapist horses and giant rape machines\
          \
        to breed demon armies. I cannot see this work appealing to anyone other than voyeurs who delightf in gratuitous, inhuman suffering. Perhaps it takes a turn for the less depraved further on, but at this point I've lost interest, and at the rate Miura puts out chapters, frankly, it's not worth sticking around for.\
Oh, but the art is impressive. There's that.\

One line: 'Highly detailed scenes. Very impressive and complex plot. Lively and varied characters. Berserk rules!'\
- [ Story - 10 ] -\
Berserk is about Guts, an exceptionally skilled swordsman and his adventures with The Band of the Hawk, along with its leader, Griffith, and other characters like Caska. After a betrayal, Guts is branded as a sacrifice by the God Hand and loses all his friends and his love, set to be killed during The Eclipse. He fights like an insane, becoming an Eclipse survivor. Following this, he is cursed and always attracts evil spirits and violence around him. He now\
          \
        devotes himself to fighting God Hand, his betrayer and all evil accumulating around him, even at the cost of whatever he came to cherish in life, accumulating scars after scars, and risking the lost of everything, including his life. All for revenge.\
Berserk is a dark, violent series, definitely targetted to an adult audience. It also contains significant amount of nudity and sex, even rape. Ok. now you are warned.\
The plotline is extremely detailed and complex, going from the present, to Guts' background story extensively, before returning to the present and moving on. This is makes very good chracter development and background story elaboration. You are told about most of the characters, how they are related, and why they behave as they do in the present. I felt that no detail lacked. Very very well made!\
The story is very captivating too. There is no humor, since it's almost a tragic story, about real suffering at the lost of loved ones and dear friends, because of the betrayal of somebody held in high-esteem. A superb plotline, which views the classic 'man fights demons' from a very different angle, as if you were inside the story. The problem is that there is no 'good side' to balance the evil powers, so Guts is all alone in his fight for revenge, with no help at all. Berserk takes another look at religion and its concepts, at god and the foundation of faith, at friendship, love and betrayal. Overall, Berserk packs an incredibly complex plot, which is definitely worth discovering.\
\
- [ Art - 10 ] -\
The first volumes have quite poor art, with simplistic toning as shading. Even the characters are sometimes weirdly drawn, with wrongly positioned facial features and some other things.\
The artist, Kentaro Miura, shows his true skills as the story goes. As the volumes go on, the level of detail, the quality of the drawings and shading increases exponentially, making Berserk a true piece of art. It's definitely one of the best illustrated manga I've seen till now. The characters and specially environments are magnificently detailed. You will see pages dedicated to picturing the environment, on which you will maintain your stare!\
Just give a glance to the armor of Griffith or even Guts. It's extremely detailed, down to the nearest mail. Plain impressive. The art is sometimes 'heavy' with shading, but this weakness is compensated with detail and intricate shading.\
Miura excells in depicting complex fight scenes, with Guts surrounded by enemies, and in great, gory details. Those spread pages are a real pleasure for the eyes. Specially when you get to see the environment too. Miura is definitely the details-man!\
\
- [ Characters - 9 ] -\
This manga takes character development to a whole new level. You are given every small detail about all the major characters, and how they are related to all the other characters. The development is made at a great pace, not too fast, not too slow. You will be given details just when they are required. You won't be complaining about lack of details about characters in Berserk.\
There is nothing very extraordinary about the characters. In fact, they all seem normal! Guts looks kind of evil and loveless at first glance, and Griffith, seems to be kind-hearted. That's just at first glance though, because the characters have incredible depth. So much that the reader can almost feel the emotions of the characters. You will even pity Guts at time, telling yourself 'poor guy...'.\
The characters are driven by their emotions and ambitions. Guts wants revenge, and channels all his anger and frustration in his fights, even hurting those he cares about in the process, literally becoming berserk. Griffith has ambition and will stop at nothing to reach his goals. The God Hand is pure evil, despite the word god often associated with good in their name. Such a lively and varied cast of characters makes Berserk great.\
Interesting enough, Berserk is one of the few series where the main character is not always present and hogging all the action. Sometimes, Guts is not even doing anything great, save for some talking. This gives other characters some role, which makes Berserk even more interesting, since you get to discover side characters. An example would be the Farnese/Serpico arc.\
Then why 9 and not 10? Because in my opinion, Griffith gets too much attention. It's just my opinion though! :P\
\
- [ Enjoyment - 9 ] -\
Berserk is not something you are going to enjoy, considering the violence and dark theme. You are going to appreciate it, if I may say. That, I did!\
The detailed art, the non-lacking story line, the varied cast of characters and the plot twists make Berserk totally great, unsurpassed in its genre in my opinion. You will get to admire, hate or even support the characters as Berserk progresses. As I said earlier, you will become part of Berserk.\
Why 9 for enjoyment? Because I didn't like Guts getting trashed incessantly for nearly 25 volumes by overwhelming force and not getting any powerups! It was plain unfair, specially considering all odds are against the guy.\
\
- [ Overall - 9 ] -\
If you can handle the violence, gore, fighting and sex, you will want to see Berserk, simply because there is nothing better than Berserk when it comes to those themes! :D\
I am not convinced about the re-read value yet. I find it difficult to go over all those dark plots again. It's going to be a once-off-love-it series I guess. For me at least.\

    Fair warning: if you can't deal with a constructive critique of a work of fiction, this review will not be helpful to you.\
This is my personal opinion and it reflects an attempt at challenging readers to engage in expanding their comprehensive and analytical perception.\
My first exposure to Kentaro Miura's Berserk was that of the Anime Film Trilogy adaptation of the Golden Age Arc. I'll start by saying this: the Anime series and the subsequent Golden Age Arc films are an absolute insult to the breathtaking Manga Saga in terms of storytelling. They are oblivious to basic narrative components such as pacing, character development and structure.\
That\
          \
        being said, this is not much different from the first 3 volumes of the Manga which in retrospect is possibly the greatest waste of potential in all of literature/art.\
Here is why Berserk is a flat-out weak series:\
It seems like Miura was trying to present an enigmatic unravelling to the key event in the first three volumes simply for the sake of grabbing the reader's attention immediately. This is not only a glaring signifier to lack of foresight on the writer's part, but also his utter laziness to exhibit his trump card from the start. Good storytelling has to follow an appropriate structure in order to engage the reader through a flowing arc. Berserk immediately throws the very fundamentals of narrative writing out the window in a pretentious attempt at being different.\
This aura of pretentiousness follows throughout the entirety of the series; especially in the Golden Age Arc. Themes of existentialism and nihilism are explored but never fleshed out because the characters are not written well enough to carry such heavy material. On the other hand, Miura has shown himself to be a masterful writer of subtlety in juxtaposition to visual luridness. Examples include the more ambient sequences of Guts gaging at the stars in isolation after being victorious in a long battle (which intricately exemplifies a symbolic and metaphorical representation of the main protagonist's inner turmoil of existential crisis) or alternatively, one of my favourite scenes in Manga history; Griffith's reunion with Guts after enduring a year of torture indirectly at the hands of his 'friend'. There is an incredibly poignant and subtle gesture before they hug where Griffith attempts to choke Guts at first glance; a small action that chillingly and profoundly accentuates their relationship in exquisitely reoccurring parallelism. This is also where the obtrusively ostentatious aspects of Miura's writing appears. Berserk glorifies itself with over-the-top violence and intense imagery to muster up threads of drama that are lazily linked together. I understand that this is meant to be a tragedy, reminiscent of many Shakespearean works but unlike Shakespeare, Miura doesn't understand what makes a tragic narrative work; there is no sense of logic or cognition intrinsically correlated to any circumstantial event. For example, it was implied that Griffith gave Guts purpose and was the reason why he ultimately decided to leave the Band of Hawks (which consequently was the catalyst to every catastrophe that occurred) but we never got an understanding of why Griffith was specifically crucial to Guts' ideology. Was it because of Griffith's redefinition of friendship out of mutual respect? Was it because Guts idolises Griffith? Couldn't be the former because that contradicts everything Guts aspired to be (independent, honourable, tenacious etc) and it couldn't be the latter because Guts wanted to be on equal terms with Griffith. It's just moronically written nonsense. Also, why couldn't we explore any dynamic character interactions between Guts and the Hawks besides his forced romance with Caska if the climax of Guts' character arc was his betrayal of the Hawks in order to \"find his own path\"? There's also the suggestion that Griffith had sexual desires for Guts with no explanation during his sex scene with Charlotte. Once again, an example of pretentiously implemented adult subtext. Griffith himself is a walking contradiction; he believes friendship can only exist if both members are on equal terms even if the other person is in direct opposition to his dream, but then considers Guts an enemy after his formal decision to leave the Hawks. Therefore his transition to a full-blown deity, albeit visually stunning and powerful, doesn't make any internal sense because his \"sacrificial\" plot-device is completely unwarranted. This not only lessens the impact of the climax of the Golden Age Arc but it's also an indication to why the writer relied over-excessively on adult subjects such as torture, rape etc to carry the dramatical impulse of the finale. An ironically childish method of storytelling if you ask me.\
There is a disjointed sense of tone after the Golden Age Arc where the themes of comradeship, idealogical clashes, art of war, existentialism etc abruptly transition to demonic cleansing, survival of the fittest and satanic redemption. This blatantly fogs the sense of direction for the narrative as there is no longer a set goal or overall objective for the main characters besides the terribly cliche revenge motive for the protagonist. Finally, Berserk features the most atrociously abysmal attempt at foreshadowing/world-building I've ever seen in any story (then again, I may have just been spoiled by One Piece...) At a point where a grim reaper appears out of nowhere to provide LITERAL foreshadowing through expository dialogue with the main protagonist to introduce the reader to a more expansive world, you know that's just poor storytelling.\
I despise divulging in 'What If' scenarios but Berserk really could've been one of the greatest fictional pieces of our time if the writer was a bit more talented and put much more effort in executing his brilliant ideas. This laziness is especially apparent in Berserk's coincidental form of storytelling; I.e Behelit's convenient reappearance in the river, Guts' luck during battle (miraculously convenient weapon placements in obscure locations), blatant plot armour etc.\
I'll end the review with the most positive thing I can talk about: the art. It's simply the most artistically integral and engaging Manga to date (besides Vagabond). Miura is a genius when it comes to expressing mood and atmosphere through exquisitely dark fantasy imagery, intricately perpetrated angles and transcendentally symbolic leitmotif.\
In the end, however astounding the aesthetics are, Berserk is a story that succumbed to typical and atypical writer's blocks; problems that are minor in less ambitious narratives but intrusively prevalent in what Kentaro Miura tried to accomplish. If you're interested in these kinds of stories that deal with dark themes in a much more mature and sophisticated way, I'd highly recommend you read Macbeth instead or for a visual medium: Monster by Naoki Ursawa. Both works are eons ahead of Berserk in terms of writing, narrative and characterisation.\

Words of wisdom and complete despair. Griffith’s speech at the top of the ballroom stairs is truly sublime and grotesque in nature. Many would agree with what is being said but only few expected the horrors this speech would imply.\
          \
        Welcome everyone to my review of Kentaro Miura’s masterpiece, 'Berserk'.\
Spoiler-Free Review (In the sense that I don’t discuss major details on plot or characters):\
Every person and their mom know how much I love 'Berserk', to the point of obsession. It is the perfect blend of many genres and styles of literature. It borrows many concepts including: tragedies (ie: Shakespearean tragedies, Death of a Salesman, etc…); literature classics that involve themes such as life experience (ie: Siddhartha, The Catcher in the Rye, etc…); the bible, organized religion and philosophy (ie: Plato and the realm of ideas); fantasy adventure classics (ie: Lord of the Rings, Wheel of Time, etc…); and many western movie epics (ie: Star Wars, Conan the Barbarian, etc…). The scope of this story is incredible but the main problem some might point out is: do all these big themes and concepts mesh well together while at the same time keeping a cohesive pacing and plot? Yes it does because all these big themes are separated by story arcs and sections where they each get their moment to shine while at the same time creating a perfect transition for the next part of the story. These shifts in themes also keep the story from not ever becoming stale and/or boring. All the while, the word \"berserk\" is the over arching theme of the entire manga. The uniqueness of the story in 'Berserk' is also unrivaled. While it does take many aspects of traditional and modern literature such as the tragic hero (Golden Age Arc) and individual societal drama (Conviction Arc), Miura added his own twist to everything like his opinion on the moral values of the themes he presents (which are all great might I add) and his own unique fantastical elements (Behelit, demon’s, God-Hand, etc…). Childhood rape is another topic that Miura delves into and it is safe to say that he handles it with complete respect and understanding. It is not a topic he simply glosses over in order to shock the reader, but is a full on subject and consequence within the story. The subject is handled with great care, subtlety, and realism. Miura makes sure that every moment, theme, and action taken within the story is a build up for the final act within the certain arc. 'Berserk' is not simply a bunch of ideas blended together but a mix of different puzzle pieces that are carefully fit in place in order to create a truly monumental achievement in story telling.\
All these different themes seem very good but is the story any fun to read or is it all just standing around and talking? Well do not fear because there is action a plenty in this manga which is all very well detailed. The action in and of itself is brilliant, and character movements are all drawn and dictated with precise panel accuracy to the point of obsession. To add to how incredible the action is, 'Berserk' itself is probably the most beautifully drawn manga (this includes comics and graphic novels) of all time. This statement of it being the best could probably be debunked, but I have not yet come across a better art-work. The character proportions and details, the world and backgrounds, the fantasy creatures, etc… are all marvelous to look at. Do not be surprised if you start staring at the art for hours on end, it is that good. Kentaro Miura in an interview said that it took him about 24 hours to finish drawing just one panel and be satisfied with it. Goes to show how much he cares about detail.\
The main character Guts is the very definition of a tragic hero. His character arc is beyond that of any other protagonist and his emotional torments are unrivaled. To truly understand this man’s point of view is to go through hell itself and beyond. Every arc adds to his growth, redemption, and eventual becoming of a hero and mentor. It is truly beautiful and poetic in nature. His character complexity just continues to grow (the manga is still publishing) and eventually he will become the definition of enlightened, or so we hope he will be? One of the many ways for a great protagonist to shine is through a great villain. Thankfully, Griffith is the very definition of a perfect villain. Taking on the classic tragic literature elements of the villain once being best friends with the protagonist, Griffith takes this idea and magnifies his betrayal to the point of complete horror. Imagine taking a man, forcing him to watch everything horrible in life and everything personally horrible to him. Griffith does exactly that and the magnitude of his crime is unbelievable. This crime is all done in the name of his own goals and dreams. The starting top quote of the review spoken by Griffith is taken all the way to the extreme. Griffith was once a man who was in love, happy, childish, angry, intimidating, fearful, compassionate, heroic, etc... But he replaced all that in order to simply follow his dream. He became the very embodiment of the anti-Christ, a man who cares only about his own selfish ends, who looks majestic in nature but is a complete and utter villain, who schemes and fools the world into believing that he is the savior of mankind. As for Guts, he learnt from this betrayal and became the very man Griffith should have been. He became the hero that everyone now looks up to. The last and only step he must now face is to defeat his inner rage, which has been building up since the beginning of the series. He must rid himself of this berserk instinct and darkness inside him. In doing so he will turn into the true hero he is meant to become and defeat the anti-Christ known as Griffith once and for all. \
The secondary characters are all incredible in their own right. Guts’ friends are divided into two groups. The first group of friends are the ones that gave him a family for the first time while at the same time each giving their own advice on how he should go on in life. They all have an interesting back story and are quite well developed, some more than others. These friends feel like people and each one of them is smart in their own way. However things change with the second group of friends. Guts’ is introduced to a new family but this time it is him that gives them advice and guidance thanks in part to the experience and knowledge he’s gained through out his journey. This second group of friends are much more interesting than the first because since they all have issues they need to overcome, each and every one of them have an incredibly well handled character arc. Guts through experience, learns to rely on his companions and they all connect with each other in different ways. The fantastic thing about each and every character in 'Berserk' is just how natural and subtle their development is. Nothing ever feels forced or thrown in your face. It is all very well paced and sometimes poetic in nature which are either done through great dialogue or subtle character actions that are well detailed. Paying attention to the drawings and art is crucial not only in terms of beauty, but character development as well. Character expressions are all taken into account and are very crucial to the story. Every interaction between the main and secondary characters has a purpose and that includes the comic relief characters/moments. The amount of attention to detail is simply astounding.\
The final subject that must be touched upon is the tone and violence of this manga. Many have complained that this series contains too much gore and nudity. If one is too delicate to look at grotesque and violent actions, then this manga can easily turn some people off. However, I assure the readers that the nudity and extreme violence all have a purpose. What does it mean to be human? Love, hatred, pain, pleasure, life, and death (readers of 'Berserk' know what moment I am referencing) are all taken to the complete extremes in order to find out that answer. Like I stated in the beginning of my review, 'Berserk' is the definition of sublime and grotesque. It is beautiful in both aspects of the extreme. This is the tone that is kept through out each and every arc. That is why the story has that \"epic\" feel which no other manga has ever been able to replicate.\
To call 'Berserk' perfect after all the praise I’ve given would still be a lie because the series is not over yet and nothing is ever truly \"perfect\". There are many ways in which Kentaro Miura can make a mistake in the later upcoming chapters. There is also one more minor companion among Guts’ group that has not had much back story or development, something I’m hoping Miura will fix in the later chapters. Some people have criticized some certain parts of the manga like the first intro Black Swordsman Arc or the beginning of the newly started Fantasia Arc, but the nit-picking can easily be rebutted. The Black Swordsman Arc was meant to introduce the world of 'Berserk' which includes: the main protagonist and antagonist, the fantastical and medieval world they live in, the tone and intense action, and the over arching theme of the whole series which is Guts’ inner \"berserk\". It is a fantastic set up and gets the reader aware of what type of journey they are about to embark on. As for the beginning of Fantasia Arc, the same introduction argument can be used because the world and rules have changed drastically since the last arc. This is all really pointless to debate because this story arc has only just begun. \
'Berserk' is by far the smartest, most diverse and well developed story I’ve ever seen and/or read. This includes comics, movies, novels, TV series, anime, etc… It is perhaps the greatest piece of literature of our generation and Kentaro Miura deserves ever single praise he gets. It is in my opinion the closest story to have reached perfection and I feel truly privileged to be reading such a masterpiece. Thank you very much Mr. Miura.",

    I can't praise this series enough. It will spoil you for anything else you'll read in the future because nothing will be able to compare to it. The plot couldn't be more epic, the emotions couldn't run stronger, the art couldn't be more awe-inspiring (particularly in later volumes), and I guarantee that Berserk will traumatize you for life - in a good way! There are no flat characters here, and you can look at the story from any one of their perspectives to learn something new and valuable about the Berserk world. There's rape and violence galore, but this manga isn't just about Guts kicking\
          \
        ass, it actually has deep philosophical themes woven throughout which I take great pleasure in exploring.\
One thing I do want to add is that the manga does not start at the chronological beginning. I strongly recommend that if you want to avoid major spoilers and get the most emotional impact from the story, you start reading at VOLUME 3 PAGE 169 (\"Golden Age, Chapter 1\"). This is the chronological beginning of Berserk. It is an ~11-volume flashback that frames the rest of the story. In the middle of volume 14 there is a \"2 years later...\" time skip. When you reach the \"2 years later..\" mark, this is when you go back and read volumes 1 through 3 completely, then continue with 14.\

    Update: 4/30/2016\
As you can tell, I was pretty disappointed with the then current state of the manga when I wrote this review. Now that the party has gotten off the boat and production has sped up, I am cautiously optimistic. Also having re-read the manga recently, I find myself liking the post Eclipse manga more than I did on the first read through. I like the struggle  that Guts must go through on whether to pursue revenge or choose protecting those he loves. This inner struggle and psychological drama is quite interesting. I also find myself liking the gradual redemption of the initially vile\
          \
        and brutal character Farnese. Of course I'm also getting worried after the introduction of Isma. My generation has spent 20 years trying to defend Miura's bullshit plot devices and various perversions and saying that Berserk belong's in High School curricula along with Alan Moore's comics. Don't you DARE turn Berserk into a harem series and fuck us over Miura! Also no more Schierke fanservice! Stop it Miura! \
\
The late 1980s and 1990s were known as the \"Dark Age\" of American comics. However, on the other side of the Pacific there was a comic that was FAR darker than any American comic of this period. Berserk is the comic that for me best defines the 1990s decade. This was a time of excess, morally ambiguous heroes, and pointless gore and nudity. Berserk took that formula, skull fucked the American comics, and shit down their necks. This is the comic where there is a pointless rape every 5 God Damn pages! This is the comic that comic stores in the US refused to carry and bookstores kept in the back under heavy plastic wrap along with the seedy pornos.\
Despite the late 80s/90s excesses of Berserk, it actually does something besides just bathe us with blood and make us blush with countless, brutal rapes. Berserk actually offers a gritty but effective parable on the corrupting effects of power and of ambition without regard to others. Berserk has a special effect on me as an American. At the same time that the Dark Age of comics was going on, corporate CEOs decimated American manufacturing by sending all the jobs that created the American middle class overseas. Wages were slashed in order to allow for MASSIVE bonuses for the guys at the very top. It was during this time that the prosperous age of the American Middle Class started to die because greedy, disgusting sons of bitches like Jack Welch sacrificed his loyal employees in order to award himself with more money and power. Griffith is a great villain because he absolutely embodies the Corporate American culture of the 80s and 90s. He is a slimy, son of bitch that has great charisma, but doesn't give a fuck about anyone but himself and is willing to sacrifice anyone and everyone to further his own power. That is one thing that gave this comic such poignancy. \
Then the 2000s happened and Berserk kept going on...and on...and on. Rather than ending with Eclipse Arc like the critically lauded anime version, the manga just keeps trucking without really knowing where it is going. In other words, Kentaro Miura seems to have lost his original purpose and is now just meandering around. Berserk is becoming more of a generic shonen manga every year instead of the brilliant and daring seinen that won our hearts in the 90s. That is one reason that Berserk doesn't have too many new fans. I don't think anyone aged 15 would pick up the most recent volume of Berserk in 2015 and say, \"Holy shit this is AWESOME!\" Berserk continues thanks to a loyal albeit zealous fandom of \"oldtaku\". What I am saying is what we all know already in our hearts. The ending is going to suck, and that is if the manga even ends before Kentaro Miura dies. It is interesting that the story of Berserk is often like a Greek tragedy, and sadly the history of the manga itself is starting to look like a tragedy. The tale of a once daring, poignant, and \"Gutsy\" comic that didn't know when to wrap up and eventually became a convoluted mess of mediocrity and deus ex Machina bullshit! Why else does the Skull Knight exist?! This is a manga with an entire character that has the sole purpose of getting Miura out of jail when he has written himself into a corner.\
Although I am not a big fan of the more recent Berserk manga, this is a series with some classic moments that defined a decade and should be remembered as a real \"game changer\" in seinen manga and for comics in general. As frustrated as I get with Miura, I have to remind myself that Berserk was once great and that is the way that we should all remember it!\

    Berserk feels like two different series. \
The first, the \"Golden Age\" arc, is where its acclaim rightly comes from- it easily stands alone as the single best Manga arc I've ever read. Deserves 10s across the board. Reading Berserk is *absolutely* worthwhile for that experience alone- superb, mature characters, fiendishly inventive plot twists, and some beautiful worldbuilding. The way it ends is absolutely heartbreaking. \
Then, after the first ~110 chapters? There's, ah, the rest. \
The post-Golden Age arc's still enjoyable- and the magnificent art style, if anything, has got even better. The problem's with the setting and pacing- it scarcely feels like the storyline has\
          \
        any idea where it wants to go anymore. The serious, heartfelt tone of the Golden Age arc's faded away, and been replaced with something much closer to a standard shōnen plotline. Guts and Griffith are still about, and the relationship between the two is still fantastic- but just about everything that made the Golden Age arc so distinctive's vastly reduced. The worldbuilding's still spectacularly creative, the sparse moments of actual plot development are interesting, and the characters from the original arc are still around, and develop in unexpected ways- but the feeling of close camraderie that made the Band of the Hawk's stories so wonderful to read about is just gone. What's in its place is a pretty, formulaic string of sequences- roughly summed up as \"Guts et al wander into new setting, mysterious phenomenon transforms into eldritch abomination, the party thwack it with magical weapons for a few chapters, then Guts screams and gravely injures himself destroying the monster of the week\". That's it- the overarching, beautifully written story of the Golden Age arc's been replaced by something that feels distinctly less... human? Berserk's become a story dominated by the spectacle, rather than the characters- which, unfortunately, has entailed jettisoning a huge part of what made it so wonderful in the first place.\
The plot's meandered along at a glacial pace for almost two hundred chapters now. Given the slow rate of chapter releases (three hundred chapters over twenty years?), it's hard to imagine the plot getting anywhere soon. \
Scored a \"7\" with a heavy heart. The Golden Age arc on its own deserves \"10\"s across the board- but the latter two thirds of the story drag the score down. The soul just isn't there anymore. \
Read it, absolutely. Just expect to find the magic trailing off after a certain point.\

    When looking at the 5 sub-categories above, I noticed myself giving every one a 10 (expect for enjoyment, which I gave a 9. I'll get to why I gave it that in a second). While I'm not particularly the strictest reviewer ever, I generally don't go throwing 10's all over the place. So, needless to say, Berserk is something unique. \
If one were to simply look at the series briefly, the average person would probably only see it as just another over-the-top action manga with a lot of nudity and sex. But that's where they would be mistaken; while violence in Berserk tends to be\
          \
        very extreme and sex IS prevalent, it is done like that on purpose.\
 Berserk, at its core, is a horror manga for mature audiences...and I'm not talking a generic spooky, ghost-filled haunted mansion story. I'm talking nightmare-like horror. Monsters exist less for the purpose of being something for Guts (the main protagonist) to kill, but are there to represent opposition for him and his \"group\". Sex almost always involves rape of a horrific nature (except for one instance, which is there to give character development).\
Characters are generally very believable and are not perfect Mary Sue's; every single character has at least one major flaw, which can often times play against them heavily. Guts has been a mercenary since a kid and knows very little outside of battle, making it hard for him to get along with others often and coming off as psychopathic at times. Griffith (the main antagonist) tries to do everything perfectly, which leads to him, more or less, going insane at one point in the series when he \"messes up\". Casca (Gut's romantic interest) is a female solider who tries to throw away her femininity in order to become an excellent solider. These are just three examples of why characters in Berserk are interesting: they have flaws that make them more believable and (sometimes) relateable.\
The art style is great, using heavy amounts of black to express the bleak tone of the series. If there was ever one manga that has a haunting-like nature to it's world, it would be Berserk (post Golden Age, one of the plot arcs of the series).\
The plot is almost always excellent. If there was one manga that could be compared to epics such as The Epic of Gilgamesh or The Odyssey, it would probably be Berserk. The only two complaint I have with the story (and the reason why I gave enjoyment a 9) are due to pacing problems (in my opinion). There are two instances where I feel the pace of the story feels off. \
The first is the very first 2 and a half volumes, which are very hit or miss in my opinion. When I went back and re-read these chapters, I found myself thinking 'you know, they probably could have cut that part out' or 'that chapter could have had these parts trimmed down'. While the Golden Age arc gives great insight to what the heck is happening and is great payoff for sticking with it, it may put off some readers who may find the beginning too confusing.\
The other part is probably the part that I feel is the bigger of the two problems. After the Golden Age arc, we head into the Retribution arc. This arc starts off with a huge nosedive in quality from the previous arc. While this arc eventually becomes good, the very first sub-plot of this arc is almost completely irrelevant and comes off as very dull and bland when compared to the exciting and well-written nature of the entirety of the Golden Age arc.\
However, these two issues are not even close to enough to bring down this great series in my eyes. Berserk truly does deserve to be the highest rated manga on MAL.\
Bottom line: if you want a manga with memorable characters, interesting themes, great art, and a captivating plot and are not afraid of graphic violence and sex, definitely check out Berserk.\

    Ah Berserk, infamous for its dark story, Rated M for Manly story, and its badass main protagonist.  Sure the manga is full of awesome moments, and Guts IS the definition of a badass, but those three things hardly do the manga justice.  \
I will attempt to remain as fair and balance in my review of this epic manga.\
--Story--\
The story of Berserk is actually the best thing about this manga, in my opinion.  The first three volumes, collectively known as the Black Swordsman Arc, start off as a simple revenge story.  Guts, our main protagonist has been wronged, and he aims to\
          \
        rectify that by brutally killing any demon/apostle and asshole humans in his way.\
However, that type of story is averted, as we're shown Guts's backstory, and this quickly changes from a revenge story to a story of betrayal, romance, politics, building friendships, enduring hell, adventure, protecting the ones you hold dear, and the psyche of the main character.\
As one progresses through the story, the more the characters are built up, the more relatable they become, and the more you start caring for them and root for them.\
Until the infamous Eclipse happens.  I won't spoil ANYTHING on this event, but suffice to say that after it, you relate with the protagonist's Jerk-Ass facade even more, and you even relate to the main antagonist.  I won't say their name for sake of spoilers.\
The setting overall, is a crapsack world.  And the reasons why Midland is such a brutal and dark place to live is shown in DETAIL.\
Overall the story is deep, thoughtful, and thrilling, and it maintains this level of quality throughout the 320 or so chapters, which is impressive seeing as the manga was first serialized in the early 90's.\
Speaking of detail, on to the art.\
--Art--\
Artwork in a manga plays just as important a role as the story, arguably even moreso.\
The artwork in Berserk is outright fantastic, and remains a level of quality throughout, which is just as impressive as the quality of the story.\
The first three volumes or so show detail and skill, but the quality is not up to the later chapters.  And that's what makes Berserk even more of a joy to read, as Miura aims to show that he wants Berserk to not only be remembered by its epic story, but he wants it to be regarded as a work of art.\
As the art style improves, we see the quality of the art get better and better.  It's very detailed, and small things like soft hand shading, character expressions, use of ink artistically to imitate spurting, gushing blood, and such make the artwork a masterpiece of pen and ink style.\
--Characters--\
Bar none, every single character is deep and realized, relatable, and likable.  Hell, even the villains are deep and relatable, even though they do deplorable acts.  No doubt deep characters are aided by the quality of the plot, but every character you can relate to, and root for.\
Special mention goes to Guts.  Guts is one of the deepest, most complex protagonists that exist.  He has faults, he makes mistakes, he's strong, and of course, a badass, and highly prone to awesome moments.  Said awesome moments aren't always battle scenes, sometimes they're conversations with other characters, chapters devoted to his psyche.  All of these make Guts an amazing character.\
Even the villains are deep and unique, which adds to the overall intrigue of the plot.  The main antagonist gets special mention, as they are shown both sides of the coin.  You get scenes where they are a good and decent person, then you get scenes like the infamous Eclipse.\
The characters just add to the story and makes it more believable.\
Suffice to say, I found great enjoyment out of this manga, and I frequently re-read it because each time I do, I find new things to enjoy about it.\
Overall, it gets a 10/10.  Amazing art, amazing plot, amazing characters all culminate to make a manga that is a must-read, even if you aren't into manga.\
A fair bit of warning though, this manga is definitely not for the faint of heart, it's dark, it's brutal, but it's so enjoyable.\

    Being a medieval-style lover, I started looking for a manga with this type of setting ever since I was introduced to manga and anime. Many people suggested Berserk and praised it as a masterpiece. It wasn't long before I saw why.\
First of all, it's one of the few manga, if not the only one, where the secondary characters' past, relationships and stories are introduced to you in a way that the plot won't get sidetracked and the focus of the story will still be on the main characters. This adds to the drama and makes the cast more interesting and realistic. And we are talking\
          \
        about a ton of information, but it won't tire you one bit. To be honest, I have never before seen an anime or manga achieving such detail with so little effort and protects the readers from boredom.\
The main characters are Guts and Griffith. One is the direct opposite of the other, both in philosophy and style. They start of as good friends that trust each other and develop a strong bond. But in the end, one will betray and another will be betrayed. Besides the \"good guys\", the villains are not your typical run-of-the-mill bad guy that wants to destroy the world etc etc. Each and any one of them has his own motive and his own story to tell. They are something more than just figures that serve to stop the protagonists' way and eventually, get destroyed by them. \
The story walks the border between complicated but easy to understand and chaotic. However, it never slips to either side. The characters might sidetrack from their original goal a couple of times in every arc, but you will never forget what they wanted to do. Berserk's magic will definitely capture you, as you will find yourself enraged and angry in several parts of the story. Also, you will have the impression that Guts and Griffith are locked in a struggle between morality, following your dreams and duty many times as the story progresses.\
When it comes to the art, one word would not be enough to describe it. The battle scenes are fluent, realistic, full of energy and it's easy to understand what is happening during a duel. Castle sieges, battlefields they are all depicted with hundreds of soldiers in few frames, but they never become too chaotic for you to understand. A notable element is the expressions in the characters' faces. You will always know a character's emotions by looking at him and even if you have doubts about someone's motives, a look on his face will confirm or not your suspicions. \
Keep in mind though, that Berserk is not your average warrior-style manga. Gore is in very high levels while violence is something common. Add sex, rape, and nudity and you got a mature manga. However, isn't that how medieval times where in the first place? There's no need to glorify these things, but there's also no need to create illusions that knights in shining armor were kind, good and rescued damsels in distress out of duty. And Berserk definitely achieves that.\
To date, Berserk remains my favorite medieval manga. And I am certain that no other manga any time soon will manage to surpass it. I strongly reccomend it and be certain that you will enjoy it thoroughly.\

    This is my first review so here goes nothing\
Berserk is probably the closest thing you'll get to perfect in any manga in my honest opinion. \
Story: The story is about Guts, a swordsman who's been training since childhood who finds a woman named Casca and a man named Griffith who would alter his life forever by offering him a chance to join his crew, the Band of the Hawk. Without saying any spoilers, Guts harbors an intense hatred for Griffith now and he gathers a team so he can snap Casca out of her funk and defeat Griffith and his newfound abilities given to him\
          \
        by the Godhand\
Art: The very gritty and realistic art style suits the story extremely well, especially watching Guts become more grizzled and tired towards the later chapters of the story. The manga's art is so well made it even inspired the game Dark Souls for some of its areas. Another noteworthy mention is the armor of the characters like Guts's Berserker armor, Grunbeld's armor and Locus's armor. They're all extremely well detailed and a pleasure to look at. The massive stone castles and mountains depicted are also marvel to look at. If I could give an example, the Kushan Empire's castles would be a good one.\
Characters: Guts and Griffith, the two stand out characters from the manga, are both multidimensional characters with motivations that you question or support as you read. Other characters like Casca, Serpico and Farnese are also explained thoroughly. The original Band of the Hawk contains lovable characters like Rickert and Judeau. All of the main cast is memorable and the enemies are especially intimidating like Nosferatu Zodd, Grunbeld and Femto. Visually, all of the characters are great too look at, ESPECIALLY the ruggedly handsome Guts. \
Enjoyment: This series has been a perfect experience from start to the most recently released chapter. Now that Miura is done with his idolmaster and is writing again, it's the perfect time to give it a read. This is an extremely well put together manga that exposes the reader to a world so fucked up yet engaging that they can't possibly put the manga down after one volume. \

    The only reason I regret reading Berserk is because now no manga or anime even comes close to how good it is.  It might act as a turn off to some younger viewers because of the violence, complex story line, sex (probably not), and tragedy. \
Everything in this anime is perfect and might take a little difficulty to be appreciated because of its age.\

    Alright so... Berserk...\
Doesn't exactly sound original but MY GOD does it suit! This ballsy, violent, sadistic fuck-fest scratches a region in my brain that itches with a red, pulsating lust for utter bat-shit craziness.\
Although, it does have its calm moments to build up characters, which revolve mainly around our #1 man, Guts...or Gatts...or Gattsu-CHHAAAAANNN!!! Anyway, this story follows Guts through his hardships (and holy shit are they hard!) and quest to destroy a certain group of people.\
Now I don't know if you've tried but Guts managed to survive in his own mother's womb after she died and freakin' gave birth to himself!... His willpower is\
          \
        so immense that he takes on wounds, arrows, grief and homoerotic obscurity and turn them into a strength that is truly awesome. He is obviously the most developed character (deeeeeerp!) in the manga and should be commended for his efforts.\
Even so with all the epicness and hard-core, buff, ripped, manly sausage festivities that is \"Berserk.\" Some of the characters and plot developments are rather dull at some points either because it stretched out for too long or because it just wasn't interesting enough and it was hard to pay attention as to what was happening. Although it did return the favor with awesome endings and the like, but it's just something about a man kissing the snake penis of a moose-headed person that just drew my attention to other things.\
When greeted with other important characters however (I won't try to spoil anything) you feel the connection they have with GATTSUUUUUU!!! and as you're taken through this grand adventure in Midland, you'll be able to grow a bond that gets stronger and stronger-- UNTIL EVERYTHING TURNS TO SHIT AND YOU SEE EVERYTHING GET FUCKED RIGHT INFRONT OF YOUR VERY EYES!!!!!\

Actually it came later with the next chapters but i was so excited to understand the story that i kept questioning \"what next, what next?\". The main character seems to be a cold heart man, killing without thinking, but the story \"Berserk\" it's all about that. Gutts suffered his entire life, borning from a dead body, walking the path of blood with his sword in his youth. Pain, pleasure, agony, wickedness comes with this story specially when he meets Griffith, his bestfriend that shares his dream of being\
          \
        the future king of Midland and use Gutts' power to do that. Soon or later, you'll uderstand how much Griffith betrays Gutts. I trully recommend you to read this mangá, without taboos, everything is explicit and relates with some issues from the past about wars and abuse at all levels, powerfull story with a art that grows better and better.\

    An incredibly blood thirsty take no prisoners style of manga where no one is safe. This title is incredibly violent and not for the faint of heart. This title is so violent that no one in the story is spared not even the elderly, the women and the children (all of whom share an equal amount of brutality) therefore this is definitely not for the squeamish.\
The story is set during a medieval Europe style world and is divided mainly  into three major arcs (for now at least since this is an ongoing series and will most likely have more major arcs in the future).\
          \
        Each arc is very different from each other for instance the earliest arc is comprised mainly of man on man combat and plenty of castle siege scenes so expect plenty of soldiers and dead bodies littering the pages, while the second arc focuses on Guts killing probably the most disturbing monsters in manga history.\
The artwork is exceptional good considering this is a long running series that started during the late 80's. There are plenty of highly detailed scenes and this can be very disturbing since it is extremely graphic with plenty of severed heads, decapitated bodies and exposed intestines. It also contains plenty of hard core sex scenes which gives you the feeling that you are actually reading a manga title. Regardless of the shear brutality within these pages, the reader will be able to appreciate the amount of detail here such as the unique armor sets of individual soldiers, the grotesque individual details on the monsters and the extremely detailed environments that range from small villages to castle dungeons and the city sieges.\
Characters are pretty well developed and mostly focuses on the main character Guts and his relationship with other major characters but the rest of the cast also share a fair amount of exposure. All characters have a dark side and it can be difficult to actually determine who the good guys are since the main character himself is sort of like a demon in nature.\
For the enjoyment part, if you like a deep story and plenty of action then you'll love it. There are plenty of chapters that only contain battle scenes\
Overall if you like an action packed blood thirsty manga with a monster fetish then this title is for you\

    BERSERK, in a personal point of view, it's just like meeting my final love. The one i've always been looking for... Two years i've first read it and still i read it again sometimes while eating for exemple.\
Why do i love it so much ? BERSERK is the story of a man like you and me a,d with the luck of a fish. Born from a dead mother and raised in a mercenary troop. Fighting for his life everyday he will lose everything, and when he finally find a goal and something special to him in his life he just lose it in the most\

ART : 10/10\
Kentaro Miura has one of the most remarquable and unique art style out there for the moment. You can't miss him for an other one and nobody can do what he is doing. It takes him a long time to make new chapters but it's because he's giving a lot of attention on each chapters and put a lot of effort in them. Each page is a master piece, simple. \
STORY : 9/10\
The story is at his base really simple : VENGEANCE.\
But what makes it special are the characters that he met on his road, the twitch that happens to him and ou weren't expecting it, the scene, the death... Everything that happens. It's just, unique and you never know what will happen next.\
CHARACTER : 10/10\
Characters are probably the reasons why Berserk has so much success. Each character has a real personnality and think differently. The character designs too are really good and show that personality. They're all unique and all have impact in the story. But the most important of them all, GUTS ! Guts (and not Gatssu) is probably one of the charismatic character out there. At first he just look like a badass who smash everything in his way, but once you lived his life since it's birth and you know everything he's been through, you're just... You're attached too that character.\
Enjoyment : 10/10\
I just love it, i read it again and again a lot since i discovered it two years ago. It was the manga i've always been looking for. Simple.\
Now just got two things to tell you, go read it ! You won't regret it. But be aware if you're against everything that is violent, that shows the true guts (ahahahah) of mankind (true violence, sexe scene, strong langage, etc...) just walk away. Not for you... \

    The first time I was reading it, the art design of the beginning kinda deterred me. Not because it was bad (it's brilliant right off the bat and surpassing all charts of measurement after the 7th volume), but because it can be as realistically disgusting as a European medieval scenario probably should be.\
However, overcoming that this manga is a masterpiece all over - up to the currently last arc, millenium falcon, sadly, where it just feels too mainstream, too arbitrary and too normal.\
Whatever, that is just one story arc. Each time I'm re-reading a part of Berserk, my mind is just blown away and I\
          \
        hate myself for having rated Berserk down to \"only\" 8 temporarily because of a certain disappointment of the latest arc. Before that, it delivered over 25 volumes (!) of pure awesomeness. Every time I'm re-reading it I feel the urge of marking every second page as a brilliant highlight of arts nad staging, well knowing that the other 50% of pages will follow next time.\
And also everytime I'm re-reading something, I'm understanding more of it. By no means Berserk could be considered a flat story only because it contains much action, gore and has no problems of displaying nudity. This story is deep, the character developements are complex but plausible and understandable, and the overall setting is more than epic.\
Do you think that these are too many superlatives for this to be a potentially fair review? Dig through the first two or three volumes until Berserk catches you, and you won't be able to help yourself but to agree.\

    The reason I started Berserk was because it seemed to be considered the greatest manga ever written. People were constantly going on about how it's a great showcasing of human will power or something like that. It's been #1 on MAL's manga list and will probably continue to be for a long time.\
My advice? Wait another 40-60 years before reading this. The current arc seems to be moving slowly and couple with the fact that the chapters come out whenever the mangaka gets around to it, it doesn't make for the most stable reading material. It's been publishing for over 20 years and only has\
          \
        about 300 chapters with no end in sight. This is one of the mangas I wish I had put on hold reading until it was finished (if it ever is)\
\
That being said, Berserk isn't a horrible story. The thrill of \"will Guts live or not\" wasn't there for the Golden age arc, due to it being a flashback but it was interesting to see Guts compared to Griffith. However, I will say that the human aspect of Guts became lost once he obtained the Berserk armor; the inclusion of magic altogether kind of ruined it for me. Art and characters are both good, very detailed and easy to decipher.\
Honestly, it's a manga worth reading. Just not now. Trust me, the wait between chapters will kill you, especially when a chapter with little progression shows up as a teaser after 5 months.\

    Guts aka \"The Black Swordsman\" is a man in a constant state of suffering. Throughout the entire manga Guts experiences every level of hell while still managing to be entertaining.\
The story is of Guts a man marked for death by a group of demons. As he travels through the land he is constantly attacked by demons wherever he turns.

        defiantly among some of the best in manga. It captures the grotesque features of the demons and the human perfectly but is not limited to horror. In the occasional pleasant moments that the manga delivers the  art really shines. The world that Kentaro Miura creates is a true fantasy and his art manages to capture it all in astounding detail. \
If you enjoy a story that feels almost like an original Brothers Grimm Fairy Tale (very depressing but with a sense of wonder and awe) you will enjoy Berserk.\

    If not for the over hype and characters (Guts, specifically) i would have enjoyed this more.\
People over hyping and praising this manga as if it was written by God himself, is honestly so disgusting and delusional.\
Guts is the biggest Mary Sue i ever had to bear reading. Although i noticed people called him 'badass'. Understandable. But that was what it cut it for me. I don't like 'badass' characters in the first place, because you know why?\
Together with 'badassary' comes big, inflated, tumorous egos, and cringeworthy one liners. \
There were absolutely no stakes when characters were getting raped/attacked by big ugly evil monsters, because Guts\
          \
        would ALWAYS come and save them from baddies. No matter how hurt, or crushed he would be.\
Sure he lost an arm and an eye, but did it cripple him? No. He got a cool mechanic arm he could fire arrows and god knows what else, out of. The eye? No biggie. Still can see with the other. It happened only because the author wanted to further showcase just how badass and cool Guts was.\
Onto the next point:\
As many people said, the females in this manga only existed to be rape-bait. Nothing more, nothing else.\
The author excessively forced nudity into this story when it was unnecessary. \
You would see many fat ugly men, without penises and only beautiful women with their perky tits, but i guess that's every seinen manga. \
At least Griffith was pleasant to look at.\
Scull Knight (?) would always deus ex machina his way into the plot, so that readers wouldn't start complaining about Guts always saving the day.\
So, how do i wrap this up? Don't know how, bye.\
p.s. this review is all over the place.\

    Reading Berserk is like eating a best cupcake in the world. You take a bite, your taste buds are assaulted by angelic taste easily trumping anything you've ever eaten. You prepare to take a second bite... and the cupcake isn't there. It's gone, vanished. You realize that you'll never get another full-sized bite of the cupcake, the only thing that keeps you going are microscopic breadcrumbs thrown towards you by the baker out of pity, or maybe out of spite, to tease you.\

    MY GOD where to begin with this review of this awesome piece of work by Kentaro Mura all I have to say that the golden age arc is one of best story arc in manga that I ever ENCOUNTERED to the to the point the golden age arc can really be it's own series. And it SURPASSES the western kindergarten tale of Game of Thrones (sorry game of throne fans). Also it doesnt end at the golden egg arc but instead takes place before the story begins and how the main character develops overtime. Also explains how is best friend is now his greatest enemy\
          \
        (not getting into spoiler territory). The art IS GORGEOUS to the point it can be considered actual art. Everytime I turn a page I want to read more and more and why this series can't get out of hiatus faster cuz I want to read it. and why it's on my on hold section of manga. I highly recommend people to read this AWESOME SERIES AND SKIP GAME OF THRONES!!!!\

    Berserk is all-time favourite for me. It has raised the Dark Fantasy bar and to this date I haven't really witnessed a Manga (or even movies/animes/games) that did a better job than Berserk in all aspects.\
The story follows life of Guts, known and feared in his prime time as the Black Swordsman. Through his footsteps, you will witness friendship, love, passion, tragic, heroism, grittiness and mostly \"revenge\". It takes this emotions up to a mature level which you will never read in any of those other shonen manga.\
The art is extremely well done. Since Berserk started back in 1990 and still going on to the\
          \
        date of this review (April 2014), you can see the artist is very devoted in carefully drawing details. The art gets better increasingly as you read.\
Regarding enjoyment, you will definitely like some of the characters' lines and fight moves. Unlike mangas like One Piece where every character talks forever, you will find out most of the characters are to the point and they tend to have conversations on feelings, ambitions and struggle rather than some madeup nonsense. And thanks god, panels are really wide and detailed. You're gonna love Guts bashing his Dragonslayer (his iconic weapon) through multiple victims.\
Whatever ending comes to Berserk, up to this point I am very pleased with the experience and if you can stand violence, dark themes and nudity then give it a read.\

    \"Too big, too thick, too heavy, and too rough…that thing is too big to be called a sword…it was more like a large hunk of iron.\"\
-anonymous, Berserk vol. 1 – ch.3\
\9Berserk is truly a masterpiece. I can honestly say it's the best manga i've ever read and I am still enjoying every last bit of it! I am now finished volume 37 dying and am waiting for the next chapter to come out (which is taking forever!). The first few volumes in the 'Black swordsman arc' are harder to get into and sometimes the art is not as good as it is in the later\
          \
        volumes. However, once you reach the 'Golden Age arc' you will probably become addicted like I was.\
\9This manga has very deep concepts and adult themes so I do not recommend Berserk for the faint hearted. But it is because of these concepts that Berserk is an awesome 'dark fantasy' with awesome fights and A LOT of gore. I would go as far as to say Berserk is like the 'Game of Thrones' of the manga world. I would also say that Batman would be seen as a wimp compared to Guts.\
\9Guts it the reason why this manga is amazing- he is one of my favourite protagonists ever because his character is in one word a 'BADASS'. His personality contrasts a lot as he has a Spike Spiegel (cowboy bebop) cool attitude taking things in his stride but at the same time you will see him become mad and act like a monster. But his strong identity is always the same. His interactions  and impressions he makes to the other characters are hilarious at times and I think they are the most awesome moments of berserk- even better than the fights! And come on, you gotta love Puck the elf!\
\9The best thing about this manga for me personally is that there is no clear line between right and wrong. This means that even our good guys are doing bad things from time to time and our villains are doing good occasionally. This is what makes the manga 'dark' for me. You can also see that Miura is influenced by western culture and fairytales. This makes Berserk stand out from other animes and there is nothing out there like it!!!\
\9Lastly, the story is great and you feel a real sense of journeying which will leave you feeling exhausted. However, at times the story can get confusing in places but the more you read the more will be explained. My favourite arc is 'Landwards Journey Towards Elfheim Arc' and I honestly found it hard to stop reading and I love the flashbacks throughout Berserk. \
Thanks for reading my review, hope you found it helpful and will enjoy reading it as much as I did :) As Berserk is no where near it's end I hope it continues to be as amazing as it has been and I look forward to reading more over the years (emphasis on years- Miura please hurry up). I recommend the anime too BUT not the movies... the visuals are truly terrible. However, the anime is accurate to the manga it's just a shame about the sudden end but I really enjoyed it. I hope they continue the anime one day because Berserk is truly amazing. ",

    First things first.Berserk is the most awesome manga i have ever read.From the artwork of the enviroment to the story i gave a 10/10 to all.But I must warn you,this is unlike the most manga you have ever read this is one of the darkest,depressing and gore manga around.It also contains nudity,fiction and the age of the displaying evens are like those of the mid-century.It also has the \"flavor\" of romance between Guts and a woman named Caska.\
The main protagonist is Guts,a fierce muscular man,with outstanding courage and stregth,known as \"the Black Swordsman\".He was raised by a mercenary and from young age many misfortunes had\
          \
        to be faced by him.When he was a teenager lone-wolf mercenary he meet Griffith,a young charming and charismatic man,who is the  leader of a small group of young mercenaries called \"Band of Hawk\".Many battles follow Guts and his band,until the Eclipse phenomenon,that changes his life for ever.Due to what happend(i try to hide critical parts of the story as i don't want to spoil you so much),Guts has swore revenge and hunt down those who brought and continue to bring misfortune to the world.\
Guts as an adult now is a fiersome monster,as i described earlier and hunts demon like creatures called Apostles.But he is not alone,this time his companion is a little cute fairy(it's called Elf in the series) called Puck,that makes Berserk series less darker and depressing.\
In conclusion,I strongly recomment these manga series to those who found Berserk interesting from my or anyone else review.I also want to express my gratitude to the readers of my review and I hope in the near future  to help anime and manga fellow fans to discover through my reviews very well made series!\

    Berserk is an extravagant work by the mangaka, Miura Kentaro. The storyline of berserk was excelletly paced. The first chapter draws the viewer in perfectly hardcore action scenes as well as creates mystery through many of its unanswered questions, It was started as seinen (men's) manga approximately 23 years back in 1989and has never dropped from the top 5 on the seinen's list. The flow of the story never bored the viewers. In most cases, stories get boring and not seem to be ultimately going anywhere.One of my grip is that the manga is still going even with Miura releasing just one every two months\
          \
        or three, and it is totally moving towards an eventual end. The only prolem that caught my attention is that it is updated like once in a blue moon. Current ratings says berserk is the #1 in Top 10 best rated (bayesian estimate), and #2 in the Top 10 best rated (weighted average), and #9 on top 10 most popular, kick ass.Berserk also got some public recognition in USA, althourh it'd still be the greatest even if it got last place in the poll. Other than the flow of the story and it action what struck me was the artwork. The shades, strokes and the clearity in the design of the characters was a breathtaking work by Miura.\
Guts, known as the black swordsman, wandered out of vengeabce through an era which one can recognize as the medieval period. He was in search of the man named Griffith who branded him as an unholy sacrifice. His path was devoid from the rest of the humanity. He had to slay demons attracted towards his neck because of the branded mark. Berserk is a dark and brooding about outrageous swordsplay, fate and dreams.\
The goldem age arc details the life of Guts prior to him becoming \"The Black Swordsman\". In this arc he travels through a variety of locations throughout the Chuder Empire and the Midland Empire. He fights over 30 Apostles during this arc, mainly encountered during the Eclipse...of the three major Apostles he battles, one of which he kills...another he grievously wounds and the third he barely manages to survive against. Guts meets Gambino, Griffith, Casca and the Band of the Hawk in addition to various other characters, friend and foe alike.Guts also loses only a handful of these fights, being the first against Griffith, then against Zodd, then against Adon Coborlwitz and ultimately is beaten down by Apostles during the Eclipse. This shows that berserka was not based on one sided probabilty.\
Over all i haven't found much of flaws in the story, the art is detailed. Maybe i daresay you find a better seinen manga than berserk. All thanks to Kentarou Miura who is a pure genius when it comes to character development.\

    This is the greatest thing you will ever read and if you give it a fair shot you will receive so much in return. If you find you aren't interested in the beginning, just skip right into the golden arc; it's not that big a deal. However; reading this is so worth it you cannot give up reading it. If you get bored just skip a few chapters and it will get better again, so go for it.\
Berserk is about such an honest human agony that you want to rip the books apart and trow them away with your heart because you can't stand caring\
          \
        anymore. The story has multiple arcs that blend together and keep you interested all the way through. The start is slow because of the detailed character development that occurs all the imperative setup that will just come back to hurt you later. The raw emotions and characters worm their way into your heart until you are every single character and even feel empathy for background characters.\
The author makes you think: while the gore happens around these characters you are often reminded that even if this is just a book, you are cheering on slaughter and mayhem. The reality is so horrible, but that's why you keep reading and want something to go right for once.\
If you watch the art while you read, you will be so pleased to see it develop alongside the story and characters. The current art is above anything I've ever seen in any manga. The artist completely understands human expression and the emotions that are being felt. While you read and feel hope, anguish, despair, love, hatred, joy, and taste bitter tears the artist displays all those same things in one expression. The emotions and expressions are all realistic to a human being and are often scared and hurt while calculating the best move for survival.\
Survival is a huge theme in this series, often times you just wish all the characters would do what's best for themselves and just give up and die.\
Despite how this may sound, reader Berserk is the best decision I ever made. The honesty and truth in the story, characters, art, emotions, and everything put together is so enjoyable you can't stop. It is brutal to read but changes your perspective on everything around you. You start to care so much and the enjoyment just escalates with the depth of the story and characters. ",

    As much as I like the art for Berserk, I feel the characters and narrative are a bit overrated and remind me of some dark fantasy books I used to read as a teenager.\
Like many I think the Golden Dawn arc is by far the best part of the manga and the quality drops off once it ends. The backstory to Berserk, finding out why the characters think and feel the way they do is a lot more interesting than watching Guts and his merry band go on an extended road trip.\

Enjoyed it from start up to the latest from character development; dialogues,  magic, monsters, (big BIG swords), boys (nyaaaa), drama - loyalty, friendship, betrayal and well, romance - it's a love story after all.\

    While reading Berserk, I came to the knowledge that the saying \"Good things, if stretched to the limits, always turn bad\" is actually true. I'm not saying that the Berserk is bad, I'm just saying that it's no longer a Berserk that punched us in our hearts, trimmed our faces out of the smiles and made us hate an imaginative person more than anything else.\
I give Berserk 10. I will always give it 10. Up to the volume 15-18 or so, this manga overshadows everything, absolutely everything. If it was concluded in the next four to five volumes, it would undoubtedly become something so masterful\
          \
        that could never be overtaken. But it didn't. Which is kind of sad and frustrating at the same time. \
I needn't bother you with what's Berserk all about; there's a synopsis and hundreds of other reviews. I'm just here to point out some things I've noticed.\
Back when I first picked up Berserk, I marathoned up to somewhere in the middle of the Golden Age arc (where Guts and Casca come closer to each other). That's where I stopped. Since I knew that Guts hated Griffith and that his sole purpose was the revenge, I was kind of afraid that Casca would die and that would be the thing that drove him insane. While thinking about it now, I think it would've been better if she had died. Sure, Retribution Arc had its moments, but regardless, Casca became a sheer burden - nothing more. I remember, during the Golden Age arc, never knowing who's going to die - what madness and what monster would appear next. Each panel had its own story to tell, never wasting any of it on some unnecessary stuff. While thinking about it now, even the ending of them all during the Eclipse would’ve been better. Why? Berserk used to be the most brutal and honest manga out there, never hiding from the horrific things that can happen, never ‘censoring’ absurd stuff, never being afraid to put it out, to make a character go insane, make him more evil than the things he’s fighting against – but what happened to that? I remember caring for the deaths of the supporting characters, even some monsters – but I no longer do that. It turned from ‘He … he could’ve survived’ to ‘Ah, whatever’ whenever someone/something dies. \
I have no problem with the long waits. There’s too much to do in-between that I almost forget about Berserk and I don’t see any wrongs there. Take your time, I don’t care – but what I care about is this immense feeling in my chest that keeps on growing – some ounce of knowledge that this story, truly, sees no ending. Not an open one, not an epic conclusion, not a sad or satisfying ending – no ending at all. Story of Guts should’ve ended a long time ago. Guts used to represent this madman, a lone wolf hanging onto a last rope of salvation – the final revenge. What happened to that? Does he no longer care for the revenge? Well, to be honest, neither would I if I didn’t think about it for a long time. Revenge no longer seems as an appropriate reason to tag next to his name. The path of revenge should be short, driven to madness until the darkness consumes you or until you get what you want. And that’s why I think that Berserk manga is no longer what it should’ve been. Sure, everyone, undoubtedly, still wants and yearns for that final climax, but will it have the same impact as it would’ve had a long time ago? I don’t think so. Heck, I even forgot about my hatred for Griffith – I somewhat started caring more about him than Guts – and that’s something I never thought would come out of my lips/fingertips. I will read Berserk until it no longer has anything to tell just for the art. Panels can be empty, no word needs to be spoken, just those sheer detailed scenes, facial expressions will always be enough for me to read Berserk. But it’d be same as reading the book just because the font looks pretty. I’ll always recommend Berserk to those I know will appreciate it just for that infamous scene, nothing more. It's had more impact on me than anything else I’ve ever seen – and I’ve seen some pretty fu***d up stuff, to be honest. \
My only hope now rests in that brutal climax, the final showdown, the battle greater than anything else I’ve seen before. The final goodbye to probably the strongest character that ever came out of anyone’s imagination. Sure, he can’t burn the world with his di*k, but he can do pretty much anything you can imagine a man doing with a sword in his hands. And then double that. Guts and Berserk are iconic names, and, for me, Golden Age is an epitome of storytelling. I know this since I am ‘writer’ myself; these things do not fly by as you go, they are carefully thought of and the impact is planned ever since those things started. I wish Miura would go back to his roots, to the honest brutality, to the world where death waits everywhere and where the thirst for revenge is the only thing that keeps Guts alive. ",

Story: 8\
The story of berserk is centered, around Gatsu , a man equipped with a massive sword and his humongous strength. Destined to live a  life of battle, and constant struggle.Gatsu  discovers  from young age, , that he can only trust his sword, and must fight everyday, just to stay alive.\
From boy to adult,  Berserk shows Gatsu's life though countless battles,  as he grows from a simple mercenary to one of the most powerful and feared knights of the land.\
Being a mature manga to the core,you can expect the world of\
          \
        Berserk to revolve around violence/gore, primal instincts,  existentialism, faith, relationships, despair, loss, life, death and everything in between. These elements are constantly being used  to give depth to the story and characters, resulting in dark and gritty  plot.\
For the most part, this is a good thing, the problem is that Berserk, tends to overuse some elements, that in my opinion don't enrich the plot or the overall experience, with the main two being rape and torture. \
Somehow the author is a big fan of these and really likes to overused them. while in some cases they make sense, in others i couldn't help but feel annoyed to see the same character being a victim of rape for the seventh time, or every bad guy  torturing random people .\
Fortunately, despite all the violence, Berserk has a good amount of comic relief, offering some really silly humor that give a nice contrast, to the darker scenes.\
\
Characters: 9\
One of the things, that you can say about Berserk's characters, is how \"real\" they  feel, and even though the story is set in a alternative historic setting, is hard not to relate to them in one way or another.\
One of the reasons for this, is that besides Berserk's large cast, every character acts and looks differently, being instantly recognizable just after a few pages.And although some characters are weaker than others, they all share the author's attention to detail, having their own inner struggles and back stories.\
In fact, most of them are given a little \"screen time\" to show what happened to them up to that point of the story, giving the reader insight over their motivations and personality .\
And in my opinion this is one of the problems of such a large cast of characters, while for some readers, the back story information might be a nice touch by the author, to others that just want to follow the story of the main characters, is just to much information in what is sometimes a very convoluted plot, with so many things happening at the same time.\
\
Art: 10\
Berserk art is in my opinion simply one of the most detailed and impressive out there. Not very  manga can reach Berserk's art quality  in terms of fight sequences, violence/gore, to character faces, clothes, weapons and backgrounds, everything is drawn to almost perfection.\
\
If there's one manga that deserves a 10/10 in terms of art, is definitely Berserk.\
\
Enjoyment: 8\
I  could have enjoyed Berserk, a little bit more if it wasn't for  the plot getting so convoluted at times, or the over repetitive rape scenes, other than that the action and the fate of the characters keeps bringing me back to this manga, even though it takes forever for new chapters to be released.\
Pros:\
- great action scenes\
- top notch art\
-  interesting story, with complex characters\
- great character development\
- mature plot with lots of violence and gore\
- great comedy bits(comic relief)\
Cons:\
- convoluted plot\
-  overuse of certain violent scenes, such as rape, torture, etc.\

    This manga was definitely not the best I've read, but it still had some elements that made it stand out. The characters are deep and complex. Their characters and personalities grow as the story progresses. You see them grow and change. You see them through triumphs and failures. You find out who is good at heart and who is not. The plot is compelling. In these regards, it is very good. \
The stories dark aspects are a strong point but also a weakness. It will definitely shock you, but I think some of it is overdone. The amount of rape that goes on in is\

        over the top. It seems like the female characters always end up naked or in see through clothing, with someone either about to rape them or being raped. Constantly. Every woman in the story has a perfect bubble butt and round tits. They have arched backs and even when laying down, perfect big globes. It seems at time like an erotica manga. I can tell you that real rape is horrifying and not nearly as erotic as the manga portrays, I think it would fit the story better if it displayed it as such. For example, *SPOILER* In the beginning when Gatt's gets raped, it is displayed as scary, terrifying, the rapist is in shadows and looks like a nightmare. *SPOILER* This is the correct way I think, to write about a rape. Yet, every female who gets raped has arched backs, big tits, bubble butt, it's made to seem very erotic instead of terrifying. \

    Berserk is a series you'll primarily want to view for the action and raw cruelty/power of the villains. It is a very visually impressive manga and shows all of the grotesque nature of its characters in elaborate detail, and if you cannot appreciate that this manga probably isn't for you. The manga is highly recommended over either of the animes, as they cut tons of the gore (with much worse art) as well as story content. Berserk is such a grotesque series that one of the best villains in the series, Wyald, is so disturbing and violent that he was entirely removed from both versions\
          \
        of the anime.\
The main character of Guts is largely generic for the most part, with most of his characterization coming as motivation to continue hacking and slashing the villains that provide most of the characterization and unique abilities. As far as story beyond glorifying villains, all of it comes from one particular climax, the Eclipse Arc, around a third of the way through the series that largely defines it as what it is as Guts' world is turned upside down.\
The series would be fantastic if it could actually follow up on villains introduced here, but they have barely appeared since despite all the time that's passed. The longtime recurring villains decay over time from their lack of use. The only real reason to read past the Eclipse is Mozgus' arc, which ends around halfway through the manga. Beyond that, no particularly interesting new villains are used and the author takes many hiatuses, with it being legendary how long he kept Guts stuck on a boat.\
Protagonists besides Guts can get rather grating beyond the Eclipse and the second half of the manga, as they contribute nothing to help Guts and largely just have to be saved over and over. It's a wonder why they even travel with Guts or he bothers to save them most of the time. There are some good protagonists before the Eclipse arc who are more developed and can actually fight, but they fade into obscurity in exchange for the new much worse ones.\
Despite these faults that take place after the Eclipse/Mozgus arcs, it's highly worth reading up to that point. While there is a decent sized gap between these arcs, you'll want to keep reading just to see what the author makes of the aftermath of all the terrible events, easily keeping your attention. After Mozgus, the series is basically complete.\

    I will start by saying that the Berserk manga is my favorite literary masterpiece. And it's not only for me, but for a lot of people. You can't understand why, if you haven't read even a few pages of it. I fell in love with it after reading 3 pages. I don't think that I am biased, just because I can't find anything wrong with it. If I have to say anything is wrong with it, I would have to do a lot of nitpicking in order to find something. And also I would like to point for all those gamers out there who love\
          \
        the game Dark Souls, that the character designs are inspired by Berserk.\
The Story\
The story in this quite complex, but let me start with the setting first. It is set in medieval times, where there were knights, kingdoms and honor. Our main character's name is Guts, and my god once you read his back story you will be crushed. There is no other character with such tragic past and life. I don't know if I will be able to keep this without any spoilers, but I will try my best to keep the to a minimum. Guts basically has everything taken away from him, in front of his eyes, by the person, he trusts the most. The moment where this happens is called the Golden Age Arc, which is regarded by many people as the epitome of writing in manga and it is said that no manga out there can reach the quality of this arc. And honestly, once you read this arc you will really need a lot of time to recover. And that's where things pick up. A quest for revenge, but don't get me wrong. You have never seen such a revenge driven story. The deep meaning behind the actions of our characters are incredible, and also this manga delves into religion, the inquisition ... Something that not every piece of literature dares to even raise questions about it. So if there are people thinking that it's just another revenge story, than you are dead wrong. There is a lot of meaning in everything. \
The Art\
Well the art as the story is breathtaking. The designs of the characters, the demons designs, the gory deaths, the torture scenes from the inquisition, the backgrounds, the castles ... Honestly it is godly. You can probably say that it is like you are watching an anime. That's how amazing it is. It is so fluid, that the crazy battles look like in a high budget anime. Also you can easily tell when time passes how the character designs change and age. It's like you are in real life. You can clearly see the main character and his companions change through time, like facial features, bodies. Everything is incredibly detailed. And don't get me started on the monsters. There are even rumors that the mangaka Kentaro Miura went to the hospital because he was having nightmares due to his work, and you can easily understand why when you see it. \
The Character\
This story has a lot of character development. And it's not forced character development, where you don't know how it happened, but every event, every conversation leads to some great changes in the behavior of our characters. And the important thing in Berserk, is that not only our MC Guts gets his time to shine and to develop his own personal traits and beliefs, but the other characters get their time to shine, and get the development they deserve. That's another thing that makes this manga a masterpiece.\
The Enjoyment\
I haven't enjoyed any other manga, or book for that matter to the extent that I enjoy Berserk. There is literally nothing out there that can compete this greatness, and I know that a lot of people are saying that after the Golden Age Arc, the manga is not that good, but for me it is perfect and still stays true to the quality and reputation its built throughout the years. \
OVERALL\
It is a must read, for anyone who wants to experience something that is hard to describe with words unless you experience it yourself. It is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The only thing that I don't like about Berserk, is the Hiatuses and the irregular releases. People who are reading Berserk for years, will know what I mean, the others who are just about to start it, will feel the burden of being a Berserk fan soon enough. ",

    The folowing review may contain some mistakes, and spoilers, i would call it not a review but analysis and few my thoughts.\
In this world is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law? Is it like a hand of God hovering above? At least it is true and man has no control, even his own will.\
\
I was 13 years old when i accidently saw last part of Berserk anime, yes, the Eclipse part.I was terrifyed and shocked, and i couldnt believe that was the end of the story.At that age i didnt knew what manga is, but in 2012 i accidently found\
          \
        it.I finished it in a day, no manga,book or movie could done such huge impact on mе.\
In this story, peoples lives cost nothing, one of the main ideas is to show how miserable human life in this world.The truth is, the man has no control, even in his own dreams or will.The fate in this story is something  unavoidable.But not for Guts, the child that should not have been born, his fate is in his own hands, the man who fighting with the whole world and seeking the revenge.\
But i still hate Miura for writing like 1 chapter in three months.\
Following are my theories abous some berserk characters and the world history.\
Skull Knight\
I just say straight-Emperor Gaiseric.And thats why: Legend has it that he ruled until God sent \"angels\" (most likely the God Hand) to punish him for his gluttony.The number of angels is in some dispute, it's supposed to be either four or five, possibly indicating that this event marked the ascension of a new member of the God Hand. According to Mozgus, the angels were summoned by a man imprisoned by Gaiseric.The prisoner, was Void, one of the members of God Hand. Slan, one of the members of the God Hand, also refers to him as 'your majesty' so he could very well be Emperor Gaiseric.\
Moon Child\
I want to believ it Guts and Caska child which has reborned with the Grifith arrival, but i think its the king of elfs, Hanafubuku.\
These are my thoughts about this masterpiece, i hope you found something new.\
\
And remember:If friends don't know what Berserk is, they are not your friends; they are only excellent soldiers.\

    Berserk is a dark and gritty medieval blood bath. The manga starts off with a introduction to the world as it is right this minute and then it pans back to the origin of it all. Now it doesn't give away any huge spoilers just shows you two very different versions of the same character.\
It spends a majority of the series telling you how one became the other. You may think this at some point may feel like a cheat or its boring cause it isn't the brief summary you read at the start of scouting this. My opinion is keep reading cause the origin\
          \
        is well done, its interesting and it piles on more interest as you go until you finally reach the present and things are a total apocalypse on the rise.\
Berserk is a action manga filled with blood,gore,violence and monsters. This is no typical manga and it really can't be described at how well they made it. The hardest thing to accept while reading Berserk is that there's no ending yet, its still in production for like over 20 years. The depth of character and plots go pretty deep and you really get sucked into this universe and can't help but turn pages faster and faster.\
I suggest you view this Boy Mercenary become a Dark Avenger in this epic saga. \

    FAVORITE. MANGA. EVER.\
I'll make my review a little different from everyone else's and just be drop dead honest as to why this is my favorite:\
I love Guts. So much. \
He is a man's man. Tall, built, and very strong. However, that's not what made me fall for him. He is ambitious and skilled, he is loyal, he runs towards his challenges (literally), he is not concerned of what others think. He loves one woman truly unconditionally. \
This is by no means a romance, but if you're looking for a read with a lot of mind and a little bit of heart, you will enjoy Berserk.\

    What can i say that has it said before, this manga is just great master piece. Bear in mind this story is not for everyone and more for the weak hearted. The story has a dark fantasy setting in were the main character has to fight many demons to survive, yet his biggest challenge will be his dark past, making him to never surrender is life and live fighting until the end. The main character will make a lot friends/comrades a long his journey that may or may not help him. One of the mayor plot development around the main character is questioning of his\

        life, did he deserves to live or he just has to give up on life itself and to make matters worse he will have to wonder if the people around him can be trusted. The art of this manga has to be one of the best out there, every detail on the characters and environment  are very realistic made, making the story more a more credible and enjoyable. The main characters has to be one of the most awesome character in manga history, making me cheer for him every time he's in pinch, others charters of the story are very well made with a lot of personalities and with a lot of development with the story. The only downside of this series it his hiatus status in were the story has begin stuck for a while, not knowing when it will continue. But nevertheless, this is a great master piece that any manga reader need to read to know this amazing experience. But be warned it has a high adult content that may not appeal to everyone, like i stated at the beginning.             \

    Overall: 9.75\
Everyone has good things to say about Berserk, but no one really recommends it for what it is. Berserk is an amazing epic fantasy series, just like a A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) or Lord of the Rings. Yes the world building is that expansive and the story is that good, and it also has insanely amazing art. If that doesn’t sound like a good series to you, I don’t know what would. The only reason why some people shouldn’t read Berserk is that it is very graphic. There is sex, violence, and sexual violence. There is a lot of\
          \
        sexual violence, particularly in the first half or so. Reader discretion is strongly advised. Also, if you prefer to read completed series, you may want to wait a while to read Berserk. It has been going on for about 20 years now and I suspect it could go on for another 15-20 more. This is in part because of the frequent, long hiatuses, and because when it’s not on hiatus it is a monthly, if not an irregular series. However, if you let this deter you, you are missing out on one amazing story.\
Story:\
I don’t even want to go any further than this MAL summary. It’s best if you just let the story surprise you. (trust me!)\
Art:                                                                                                                          Did I mention the art was insanely good? Because it is. Like I said before, Berserk has been going on now for around 20 years. The art goes from pretty solid -> very good -> 11/10 as the artist improves.\
Characters:                                                                                                            The protagonist, Guts, is an amazingly well-written character. One of the best in any fiction I’ve ever read. Also, some of the other main characters are also brilliantly written. That being said, later in the series, some side characters get introduced and most of them are pretty one dimensional. This is why some people say Berserk loses some of its luster after the Golden Age arc. In my opinion, it is still just as good but in a different way. You will have to judge that for yourself.\

     This Manga has got a dark Mid evil fantasy setting and centers around a Swordmen's who carries a huge sword named Gatts and a very ambitious mercenary commander named Griffith. The story starts in the middle with Gatts alone and going on a few quick adventures before he meets and try to kill a creature he calls Griffith. The manga then goes back for a least a hundred chapters (maybe 200) to explain the backstory. It then goes past the opening chapters to continue the adventure. This manga is freaking amazing. A huge epic adventure worthy of the hundreds of chapters. This manga holds\
          \
        nothing back. Over the top violence, horrific daemons, sex, nudity, rape, human sacrifice, religion, growth, comrodory, and lots of death. It may not be something I want to read while someone is looking over my shoulder, but it was something I wanted to read at almost any other time. My only complain is that the Manga isn't anywhere close to being finished yet. I know One Piece is the most popular manga (I've quite a ways into One Piece and plan on continuing to read though it this summer). If you can deal with a darkness that holds nothing back, I would recommend reading this first. 10/10.\

But Berserk is different, It is stated by the Author that Berserk is more about Emotion than Logic unlike most other manga that are Logic>Emotion. So there is a lot of emotional growth within Berserk which can be very boring to a lot of people or very good to the ones that love this series. If Berserk was like any other average series, by this current chapter there wouldn't\

    Story : Definitely the best of its kind and i absolutely loved it . First off people who read just the first 15-20 chapters and decided not to continue , turn back and go back . The golden age arc was out of the frigging world . Story developments are very intriguing and the way it builds up is very good , the arcs are adequately paced with new info . Overall one of the, if not the best story out there and the most disturbing and dark.\
Art : The first few chapters are choppy but Kentarou Miura senpai makes up for it with what\

        i would say the best art you will ever find , well that is in lieu of comparison with the likes of One Piece , Naruto , Bleach , Fairy Tail the combat is a bit confusing but Berserk's combat is very clear and you get every single move. Overall it is VERY GOOD\
Character : Again the best character development , (not to be an OP fanboy) but i really loved One Piece character development's but this one has set a standard . Farnese's character development was fantastic and Guts and Griffith i don't even have anything to say .\
Enjoyment : Yeah i enjoyed it , would be an understatement there were times when i jumped of sheer excitement and exclaimed because of the sadness , an epic dialogue or something like that . \
Overall : I have read a lot of manga's this one is without any hesitation , simply THE BEST manga i have ever read. FMA doesn't compare to this and THAT is saying something . Extreme blood and gore , dark theme , lot of violence , incest, everything a seinen should have. Took me 20 days to complete it and well this manga is definitely completed thanks to Miura senpai's permanent hiatus. Every adult should read this it's that good .\

    *NO SPOILERS*\
   Berserk lets you know within its first panel that it's an adult manga and that if you're not ok with that, you should put it down immediately. \
Rape, gore, swearing-- anything and everything vulgar is present in Berserk. \
   Berserk is about a man named Guts and his quest for Revenge against a new god (kinda) named Femto. \
As the manga's main premise is set after its first arc, (\"The Golden Age\" volumes 3-14) it's really hard to not spoil anything for you. I'll have to remain kind of silent about its story, as its surprises and twists are\
          \
        insane, and I want you to get your full experience.\
   If there's one reason I could tell you to read Berserk, without spoiling the story, it's the art. I can say, without a doubt, that Berserk has the most impressive art of any manga or comic I've ever seen. It is utterly breathtaking. \
Its designs are amazing as well. Every armor set that Guts has had is pretty unique, the weapons are really neat, and everyone has a face very unique to them. \
The most impressive designs go to the monsters throughout the story. They're unique, grotesque, and very different from monsters I've see in other fictions. \
Aside from designs, the characters themselves are also very fleshed out and unique from one another. \
I think that what makes a good character is their actions, not their personalities. Berserk has one of the most involved casts out there. \
If they've been useless, you can count on them either leaving the story, or doing something of use later.\
   The only problems I have with Berserk are its inconsistency of tone, and the constant, meaningless rape.\
Let me address both: At first you get the feeling of a hopeless world with Guts as its only person with a will to fight. Then it goes to the Golden Age arc, (A fan favorite, not mine,) which is placed before the hopeless feeling world. This one feels like a classic, medieval fairytale. Still dark, but there are prospering kingdoms, and hope. After the Golden Age, it goes to the Conviction arc, (My favorite,) where it's once again hopeless feeling. Guts is alone, trying to figure things out, while endlessly fighting for his life and searching for revenge. Next arc, it feels like I'm reading a video game... Guts meets allies and kind of calms down. He starts to seem like a fatherly figure and feels like the DPS character of your MMO. He's still the main character, but dialogue is coming from mostly his allies going, \"How can anyone lift a sword like that!?\" \"What power! How will he ever defeat this enemy!?\" I'm honestly bored of where Berserk currently is. The only thing keeping me with it are its art and the suspense. I want Guts to get his revenge, I want things to happen, but I have to sit behind an MMO feeling for these arcs. (The Falcon of the Millennium Empire arc, and now the Fantasia arc.) \
My other previously mentioned \"problem\" is completely opinionated: The constant, useless rape. \
Now, I get that it's in a dark, medieval world, and that back then, if you were a peasant and pretty, you'd be likely to get raped. A lot of times, the rape in Berserk is tied to the story and is important for setting a dark tone, but at some points it was straight up predictable and almost comical. \"Oh, female character is missing? I guess they're gonna get stripped and almost (or actually) raped.\" \
I can think of seven times that rape was important to the story, but trust me, many other rapings will occur, simply because the artist loves drawing sex. \
I warn you again, there are hentai-like moments everywhere. Sometimes, genitals are shown. \
   Berserk is an insane ride that's been going since 1990, and I can't see the end yet. If you don't care about vulgarity and you love art, Berserk is a must read. \
I apologize for not telling much (Really any,) of the story, but take my word, it's very interesting.  \

    Being the top rated manga on MAL, inevitably, I began Berserk with high expectations. Ultimately, Miura makes fantastic use of the medium to bring us a compelling story with well fleshed out characters. Despite this, the manga begins to suffer from a few overarching issues, at certain points. \
Story- 8/10:\
The first thing to note is that Berserk has a relatively slow start. I personally think that the story would have been more interesting and suspenseful if it had started from Guts' childhood. \
However, the Golden Age Arc quickly makes up for any issues with the opening. As many people have already observed, this arc is\
          \
        where Berserk truly shines. It includes a bunch of meaningful fights, character interactions, and fantastic world building. All of this is combined with a bunch of overarching philosophical messages. \
Miura conveys the themes of the arc wonderfully, through imagery, such as the ''Campfire of Dreams'', or through the character's monologues. The use of a narrator made the series play out as a novel at times too, making it an absolute pleasure to read and experience. \
I do not think that it is necessary to divulge any of the themes in Berserk, as that itself is part of the reading experience.\
The main factor detracting from my score here was consistency. Especially later on, some encounters drag on and don't add much to the overall plot. Having said that, the overall story and world-building of Berserk are excellent. \
Art- 9/10:\
The art gets better as the manga progresses. Miura does a wonderful job of juxtaposing light and dark shades throughout the manga. Especially through his character designs. The imagery of light surrounding Griffith's character was nicely contrasted with the dark imagery that characterises Guts. This magnificent use of imagery reflects how morality is not as black and white as it may seem. Furthermore, it could be interpreted as a comment on the hypocrisy of religion and idolatry. There are many ways to interpret things in Berserk. That is what makes it wonderful to analyse.   \
There is definitely not much to complain about here. The overall style fits the morbid tone of the series too.\
Character- 8/10:\
Although the two main characters are well-developed and intriguing characters, a few of the side characters were far too archetypal and one-dimensional. Puck and Isidro are the largest culprits here. They provide unnecessary comedic relief and really ruin the tone of the manga.\
Berserk's plethora of side characters mirrors the vastness of its world. As a result of this, some characters are inevitably more likeable than others. My personal favourite side character was Serpico. His backstory is wonderfully written, and his character growth is lovely to witness.\
In my opinion, Griffith is the most interesting character in Berserk. It is fascinating to see the polarising views on Griffith from Berserk fans. He is an extremely enigmatic and complex character. Griffith is everything an antagonist should be-- he has genuine depth, and no cliché sob story behind his motives. \
Enjoyment- 8/10:\
Berserk is a highly enjoyable series. The only thing detracting from my enjoyment was the shallow humour and some of the elongated encounters I alluded to earlier. \
I would most certainly reread my favourite segments of the manga. I'm sure I would pick up on more minute symbolic details upon reading it a second time, too.\
\
Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend Berserk. Although it has a few flaws, at its peak, Berserk is unrivalled. ",

    ((There is a spoiler in this review. If you saw the 90's anime, go ahead and read.))\
Berserk is of course extremely popular. You probably live under a rock if you haven't heard of it. Many fans see this as a landmark not only for manga but for storytelling as a whole, and I'd say they were probably right at some point, but I'm not sure if it still holds up. I personally loved what I read, however following a number of convoluted plot developments it could no longer captivate me any more past a certain point. Thus I dropped it. Unless the author overworks themselves\
          \
        to an unhealthy degree, most long running manga suffer the curse of frequent lengthy hiatuses with intervals strewn by drops in quality, and Berserk is definitely one of them up there with Hunter x Hunter.\
What are the strengths and weaknesses of Berserk? The artwork is definitely its biggest strength. From a visual standpoint, Miura knows what he's doing and he knows how to do it well. From the gory, bloody details of the inhuman Apostles and footsoldiers being chopped in half, to the fluently articulate armor, and to the detail in each and every brick of castle walls, Berserk simply looks beautiful. \
Now, where does it falter most? I'd say it's equally with the story and characters. The characters... Initially we have Guts, Griffith, and the notable Band of the Hawk members, like Casca, Corkus, Judau, Pippin, Gaston, Rickert so on and so forth. These characters are all very enriched to a degree and show potential for very deep development, but the problem comes after the Eclipse when Griffith kills off every Band of the Hawk member to ascend to a member of the God Hand except a now one-armed Guts, a retarded Casca and an absent Rickert. What does Guts get as a replacement for his now dead friends? Two dumb kids, two fairies who exist only for comic relief and some defective church missionary chick that idolizes him. None of them do anything interesting.\
Despite Guts retaining his objective to cling to life and enact revenge on Griffith, the story goes all over the place and there are point where it's even a little bit tricky to follow. I believe it reaches its peak around the Tower of Conviction arc, which encompasses every one of the good things in Berserk. Everything from there is downhill.\
Unfortunately author and illustrator Kentarou Miura has grown incompetent to the point where it's not certain if this work will conclude properly, and therefore the merits of taking the time to actually read hundreds of Berserk chapters becomes obscure. Is it good? Yes. Is good enough that it's worth your time? It might not be. I can't tell you to read Berserk or tell you to stay away from it either. \
Decide for yourself, but take my thoughts into account.\

    The lovely Berserk,\
I first watched the Anime, before I started the Manga, I loved the Anime, but the sudden stop just got to me and made me start reading the manga.\
You jump into it, wondering where the Anime started from, which goes to show it was really jumbled up,\
The story is about Guts and the Hands of Evil, basically big demons fighting each other. while most are immortal, and Guts isn't he proves to be capable to slaying demons. the bigger demons are annoyed, thus they want to kill him, one of guts friends became a demon, a powerful one, but you must read to\
          \
        find out how and why he became one, I'd recommend people not to watch the anime if possible and just read the manga, then go to the anime.\
You will get uber confused when the manga starts and you'll get uber bored when the manga hits the anime arc.\
But all in all it's good, took me awhile to pass through the arc of the anime but I've finally finished that.\
The art is cool, it's a bloody manga.\
worth a read.\

    Berserk, a very impressive manga. Great art work, story not too bad, lot of nudity and gore. I like, I like. If you ever read Shin Angyo Onshi,( i think that's how it's spelled) it's pretty much like that. The main protagonist has a glorious past but later was betrayed by his comrade, who eventually attained godly strength and the protagonist wants to extract revenge on the near-impossible-to-defeat villain. \
Forgot the main character's name, but basically he can wield a big ass sword. Has like 60 gallons of blood inside him. Can get strike by lightning, burn by fire, hit by cannons and sh*t, and\
          \
        he'll still be alive. In my opinion, this guy might as well be an undead.\
The villain of the story, aka the boss, started out as a near homosexual pretty boy who's charisma is great enough to have any men/women be drawn to him. He eventually attained god-hood and is the main protagonist's final goal. \
Good read.\

    First of all, keep in mind that I'm a bit older than average manga readers.\
Art: It's bad. Character models and drawings are nowhere near good enough. When in action, it's very difficult to see what's going on, especially in early volumes. It's slowly improved but at the end it's still just at an acceptable level.\
Story: Good for the most part. It's terrible at the first 3 volumes but then the story goes back to the beginning and things are well explained. This is the best part of the story (golden age). After that, when Guts found new companions, story got illogical and boring. At times,\
          \
        it feels like Moon's Sailor.\
The author's obsession with sex and rape causes excessive uses of these in the manga. At times it feels like porn.\
When I got to volume 30, I lost all my interest and just skimmed quickly to the end. The ending is non sense.\
Not recommended obviously for grown-up readers.\

    Before reading Berserk, I never actually thought I would find in to something with more gore than Hellsing. I kinda feel stupid now.\
Story 8/10\
The story doesn't really start till a few volumes in giving the series a rather slow start. After that we get to enjoy an amazing storyline before coming back to the start, except this time we know the context.\
Art 10/10\
Incredibly detailed without preventing you from seeing what's actually going on. If there's something I can complain about it's that Puck often gets drawn in some weird style which annoyed the crap out of me.\
Characters 9/10\
Instead of praising the character development I'm just\
          \
        gonna say what bothers me, and that is the fact that I simply don't like about a third of the characters.\
Enjoyment 8/10\
After the amazing storyline mentioned in the Story portion the series stays awesome for about 10 volumes or so till taking what is in my opinion one of the biggest nose dives in history.\
Overall 9/10\
If you are bothered by gore or don't like depressing stories, then you should not touch this with a 10 foot pole, otherwise you should give it a try.\

    \"In this world, is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law? Is it like the hand of God hovering above? At least it is true that man has no control; even over his own will.\"\
William Tecumseh Sherman once said, amongst many other things, that war is hell. And Hell, when regarded in a biblical sense — which, when concerning Berserk, chock full of biblical allusions as is, seems a fine thing to do — is supposed to be eternal. Does that mean war is eternal? Does it mean war is an eternal hell?\
Berserk is, at its core, a two-pronged fantasy epic.\
          \
        The prongs are made up of these subjects: revenge, redemption. Our protagonist, Guts, is constantly forced into sharp corners to make a choice between the two, all the while having otherworldly creatures tell him over and over that what he so pugnaciously fights against is merely predetermined. And yet, that foreseen future is clouded and indeterminable, for both Guts and the reader. Perhaps one of the most brilliant things Kentaro Miura has done with this story is that, with whichever path Guts chooses throughout — and he vacillates every now and then, particularly for the first half or so of the manga — us, the readers, can both agree and disagree with his decisions. As he flies into blind furies, killing the monsters he loathes with all his being and destroying his own body in the process, we dislike him for not following the path of righteousness, but are able to agree that his indignant disposition is entirely justified, particularly upon the revealing of his terrible past and the reason he so hates the Apostles and the God Hand. Similarly, when he see him choose the righteous, ofttimes just as difficult path, we can accept that this decision is most likely the more morally correct one, but secretly we wish that he would tear apart whatever beast stands before him, one of a legion of things which took everything he loved and cared about from him.\
This manga is lengthy — at 340 chapters as of writing this — and shows no signs of stopping soon, what with the incomplete story itself, the long waits between chapters, and frequent, protracted hiatuses. It moves in arcs, typically with the primary villain being slain by Guts at its end, and every arc grants an important addition to the overall story (as an arc should). While critics of Berserk complain of the way in which information is introduced, often saying that it could be shown in a more compressed or concise manner, the subtle way in which major plot devices are foreshadowed combined with the explosive nature of their formal presentation is cause for no complaints from myself. The story has an obvious current direction with a mysterious and far-off end; while the current place the manga is at has been treated as the worst part of the story thus far, it has been clear what it means for the Berserk universe on the whole, and where the story will go from there.\
Berserk is hailed by many as the greatest manga to date. While I certainly would not agree with that statement at the moment (though if it ever ends, I may have to reconsider it), the reasons beyond a solid story for that communal thought are easy to agree with. Berserk, undoubtedly, has the best art of any manga. Trust me and the community when we say that Berserk and Kentaro Miura are the current pinnacle of manga when it comes to visuals alone. If you do not believe me, simply Google \"Berserk best panels\" or something of the like. Truly, Miura’s dedication to extreme detail turns out stunning and beautiful on a consistent basis. This alone may justify the irregular release schedule: anyone who knows anything about mangaka knows that the job has horrid work hours, with many authors working from deadline to deadline on little to no sleep. Many have the resolve to become a mangaka, but none so far have come close to putting as much exhaustive detail into their works as Kentaro Miura.\
Perhaps one of the greatest things Miura has done, though, is the battle of, and battle for the distinction of, good and evil.\
Several characters throughout Berserk can be considered, without a doubt, evil. Those of you who have read it or have watched the anime or have simply seen tidbits of various characters here and there will know exactly of whom I could be speaking of. However, many characters embody desires or ideological points of view that are somewhat more ambiguous in nature. Guts, our protagonist, is obviously one of these, for reasons outlined previously. Others, though, are abound. Some do their questionable actions based entirely off of selfishness, while others see what they do as . . . just. Or, at the least, justified. Many of these characters die, but the ones that live on undergo some of the greatest character development I have seen in probably any work of literature, alongside a raging of philosophical ideals akin to that of Watchmen.\
Berserk is not without its problems, though these problems may be few and far between. Ones that I occasionally agree with are a vagueness of story and unnecessary plot elements. These, however, are often overridden later on when the point of a certain action or development is revealed in full -- something I look forward to as the current arc recedes in the rearview mirror. One that I definitely agree with, and often point out myself, is the rise of terrible humor. Chibi comedy. I can stand it in spurts, but some characters are growing far too chibi far too often for it to not be annoying. Not to mention that it does nothing to further the story or the art. These moments are stains on what is otherwise a masterpiece.\
Now, to get this out of the way: Berserk is a seinen that deals with very mature themes rather . . . unabashedly. Rape, murder, theft, all those evils of the world are brought to the forefront of the manga with Miura’s relentless penmanship. That means, yes, gore, sex, rape, loss, insanity, all that is shown in graphic detail. If you are queasy or conservative about those sorts of things, do not even bother picking up the first volume of the manga. I myself have no complaints about Miura’s depictions of violence, but many people do, and those people need to understand that it is simply what you will experience in the brutal world of Berserk.\
Overall, Berserk is one of my favorite manga of all time (although I have not read too much manga to begin with), though is by no means my favorite, mostly due to its incomplete story and inconsistent release schedule, as well as, in more recent chapters, a rise in dumb chibi comedy that I find distasteful for the type of manga it is.\
 Do I recommend Berserk? Hell yes. The art is absurdly good, the story thus far is compelling, the characters are diverse, interesting, and non-stagnant, and it produces excellent philosophical conundrums, questions, and systems. Just know what you’re getting into: graphic imagery and a long wait for the finish line.\

    The Tragedy of a Badass\
Like many seemed to lately, after seeing the atrocious CGI of the new anime series, I was drawn to revisit this timeless manga once again and was especially ecstatic to do so with the newly released volume. Berserk is a series that can not possibly be praised enough in terms of writing, visuals, character design, world building, plot structure, themes conveyed, I could go on for days. This is a story so far beyond almost anything else in the medium, or any medium for that matter, it single-handedly, in my eyes, has the ability to raise what has been a somewhat\
          \
        scoffed at art form, such as manga, by the ill-informed to the status of high art on the level of any great fantasy novel or virtuoso's painting.\
The pages of these stories could fill entire museums many times over, the meticulous attention to detail and expanse of the work is absolutely awe-inspiring. If looks weren't enough, the story could best be summarized by saying that this is an epic at a scale that would give Middle Earth a Napoleon complex, a maturity of theme and brutality that would make George R. Martin squeamish and a wealth of complex, compellingly dramatic and devastatingly tragic characters that would force the likes of William freaking Shakespeare tip his ridiculous feathered hat out of respect. This is a story that may be off-putting to those averse to violence and overwhelming nihilism at times, but to make it through along with the classic characters is an experience you'll never find anywhere else. It's as close to flawless as art can get in my eyes, 10 out of 10 baby!\

    Here's my take after reading 352 chapters of the phenomenon known as Berserk Kentarou Miura.\
Nowadays, when we look at the different media of Anime, Manga, Movie, Gaming etc. we can say that it had come a long way to this point. A lot of innovations had been done, but there are more recycled ideas and concepts that are reused over and over again.\
When I ask most people around me what do they think of when I say a Man wielding a gigantic sword they quickly refer to Cloud from final fantasy VII, the monster hunter's great sword, Kisame's Samehada from Naruto etc. However, most of\
          \
        the are not family of the origin of who started it all an made it popular: Guts!\
Most innovations in terms of story telling and character development had been done first by Berserk, if not, Berserk created the most memorable and most amazing plot twist of all with Guts and Griffith which I will not spoil here. They are two of the most well developed and fleshed out characters that you would see and read out there. \
Speaking of the characters, I would also mention that in every story, the supporting cast is vital to lift the main characters up to their zenith, and Berserk does not lack in this part from the likes of Casca, Farneze, Serpico, Zodd, Schierke, and the Skull Knight.\
Every arc of Berserk can stand out on its own as they are masterfully written  and no page of serves as a filler; every panel of every page of every chapter of every volume is a great read. It is action packed to the very essence of the word \"Action\".\
The art of Berserk is like fine wine, it just get better with age especially now that it is serialized monthly. Kentarou Miura produces some of the greatest manga panel in all of manga and it just grow more with age. \
If there is one downside to Berserk for most readers it is the fact that Kentarou Miura have a sickness called the Togashi Syndrome which is the sickness of taking frequent haitus. Although this is a great thing for me since it keeps the quality of the manga which is worth the wait in the end.\
All in all,. if you want a great action manga full of blood, gore and pure unadulterated batttles I would suggest you give Berserk a read. \

    Berserk - An Infinite Loop (?)\
Carrying a sword bigger than himself and using a mechanical arm, the mysterious Guts carries with him a shower of blood and leaves a trail of corpses wherever he goes. At his side, the little elf Puck is surprised by the terror that haunts the Black Swordsman. His \"stigma\" attracts demons and evil spirits and among hordes that persecute him, Guts seeks revenge.\
First of all, Guts is a really mysterious person. I didn't know Berserk, except for his fame. I hadn't read the manga nor watched any episodes of the anime (2017) and it was very pleasant to read that\
          \
        first volume. Not that anyone who already knows the title would not find it, but it is very good to read something that you already know will improve, to see that fame is not for nothing. As I didn't know the details of the plot (I only knew that the story was inspired by Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\"), this manga is loaded with mystery.\
Guts live by defeating demons and with a mark on his neck, he has a stigma that attracts him. This same stigma bleeds when he approaches a creature dressed up as a human but actually feeds on them. We know that he seeks revenge, that he throws himself into this sea of blood for this, but we don't know the reason. He seems to be completely indifferent to the people around him, but we realize that it is something he wishes to establish, does not bond with anyone, does not suffer from losses. In short, Guts looks like a demon who has taken this path against his will, which has suffered greatly to the point where we know him.\
The comic relief comes in the form of a little elf named Puck which Guts saved, though he himself denies it happened. The elf goes on to follow Guts and sees the darkness and horror surrounding him, but also sees that deep down, deep down, he is a good person.\
The characteristics of Miura Kentarou fits in well with this type of story. Even in action scenes, you can clearly see what is happening, along with the gush of blood. In addition to the various sinister creatures exposed largely in the manga, the good thing to know is that he improves this trait more and more. The only negative point about Berserk comes not from his edition, but from the author himself. Miura writes on average two chapters a year and this makes the manga a risk of never being finalized.\
All the mystery present in this first volume of Berserk binds the reader to the pages, besides the trait and, for those who like, blood and violence.\

Personal Note: Bought the first volume in Japanese and again, the story told in an oriental tone makes the reading experience somewhat different from the point of view of a western reader. This is the review of volume one only. I have a crush with first volumes of manga and in Berserk the key thing is this: for me the first volume sums it all up, summarizes the main idea of the author, the ostentation and what he really gave up to do, the second volume presents the reasons why the author chose that idea, basically explains the reason of the protagonist and the third volume (in this particular case) ends the main idea, which is the Black Swordsman Arc.\

    Okay, in addition to a review this is also a response to the review that gives a 7 overall. \
First I'll start with my review. \
The characters, while their design is good there are some issues. The biggest being Puck. I'll try my best not to spoil things, but I'll just say that he had some uses at first such as looking into people's minds and giving us some information on world-building. Now he's literally just comic relief and occasional healing. And I'm pretty sure I'm using literally the correct way. Everyone else . . . they're good, although the fact that two girls are\
          \
        into Guts at the same time is a bit haremish. I don't really have anything else to complain about. The villains are good, they are certainly never cliche. Come on, who would think the Count was cliche? \
Next, the art, goddamn the beautiful art. Describing it doesn't do it justice, just look at it. \
The story does seem to have it's issues. Namely what I've heard of the long hiatuses that Miura has and that there were 9 years of being on the boat. And the Sea God arc was pretty unnecessary and so were the pirates, it was almost like I was reading filler. Everything else is amazing, I understand the strangeness of the Black Swordsman arc in the beginning then the long Golden Age arc, but honestly I think it shows how fate works in this world pretty well. Although I've heard that the real reason Miura chose to put that arc first was to get attention and start up. \
Overall, it's a 9 to me. Great, so great, but not perfect. \

    I graded this with a 9, because it is still on-going and I don't know what to expect of the ending. Plus, I had very mixed feelings about this manga and it made me think a lot. I don't usually write reviews, but I felt this would clarify my thoughts on it.\
-- Overall Impression --\
First of all, this is a very gory piece of work. And I mean it. Men get slaughtered, guts everywhere, monsters, blood, torture, death, decay and all its companions**. The art is so good, that it sends chills down your spine, or at least you feel a bit sick after seeing\
          \
        all that. And then you get used to it, because in Berserk, the world seems like a vast ocean of despair. That is all the more reason for the human side of things (courage, love, sacrifice) to shine through. \
What I really enjoyed in this manga is that the depiction of human feelings and thoughts is very real and very cruel. This manga makes you ponder and question humanity (and yourself while you're at it). It isn't just about a hero or a man seeking revenge (or at least I enjoyed the side characters more). I would recommend it only for those brave enough to endure the gore (I also avoided it for long because of the horror part), it certainly is one of the best I've read so far and it leaved a very deep impression on me.\
**And also, I don't get why everytime you see women attacked, there's a rape. I mean, this is really a theme in this. Rape comes hand in hand with torture and death. Very troubling.\
-- Characters and Story --\
Characters: They really do seem to fit into the setting of the story: a time of war, of cruelty, of survival. Sometimes they surprise me, because when I expect them to be monsters, after committing crimes beyond imagination, they actually seem human or at least have feelings that a person could understand. For example, I liked the arc with the Count and also Luka, who almost seems out of place.\
Main Characters: I am looking forward to see what happens. I really hope this doesn't turn out to be something like every female character has something for Guts which would be really annoying. Griffith is a really interesting character, because of his impatience to create a new world and his mistake, his fall. The twists of the story and quite thrilling. Speaking of twists, Caska's reaction after Griffith's transformation was a sort of a let-down but also a way for the story to keep rolling. I hope to see a come-back of some sort or an insight on her thoughts/feelings.\
Story: On first sight, the plot may seem kind of boring (the betrayal and the revenge cliche), but it gets better because in my opinion, the characters are complex and Guts's view isn't always single-minded. But I don't know where or how the story will end, so I wouldn't bet on the story yet. So far, it was quite enjoyable, especially the time skip in the past.\

    First a little bit about me. Berserk is a dark fantasy. I love dark fantasy and honestly find fantasies like Lord of the Rings really boring. However, I don't love Berserk simply because it is a dark fantasy; when you have such an epic, epic story with some of the most memorable, coolest and compelling characters ever, it's more than enough to keep me reading.\
First of all, I don't think Berserk is for everybody. Sure it has great characters, narrative, plot, emotion, etc... But it's very, VERY violent. In fact, it's bar none the most violent manga I have ever read. Kentaro Miura is a\
          \
        great artist but man, sometimes he comes up and draws some TRULY MESSED UP AND SCARY CRAP. Berserk has a lot of people getting dismembered and killed very violently including children and the subject of rape is discussed a lot and even outright shown. However, it is all dealt with tastefully because despite how explicit it is, it's used to show how messed up the world of Berserk is and how much suffering the victims are going through. Hell, I think Berserk is one of the few works of fiction out there that have a male rape victim as a character. However, for anyone who can withstand this stuff, there is a lot as these subjects only serve to further the story.\
Speaking of story, it is simply outstanding. Like that of Rurouni Kenshin, Berserk has a simple story. It's about a man seeking revenge against his former best friend whilst protecting the woman he loves and meeting up with new friends. When it isn't about that, it's about a complete monster anti-Christ wannabe trying to conquer the world and his own companion’s misadventures and when it isn't about that, it's about how the events of the manga came to be the way they are. There isn't a lot of politics and rubbish about battle strategies and complicated stuff we don't care for, it's all about the motivations of the characters and how and why they try to fulfill them. And when an emotionally challenging conflict crosses their path, you can expect it's going to be either a very sad encounter or a very heartwarming one.\
Guts himself is hands down one of the most complex, inspiring and BADASS characters ever made. Since character development plays a HUGE role in the story, seeing Guts change from a guy only caring about swinging his sword to someone who wants a bigger dream to a cruel knight in black armor and again into a man with a dream was a pleasure to read. What I love the most about him though is how he never gives up. He had to pass through ALOT of suffering before he passed 20, a million times more intense than most anime protagonists passed through yet he never gives up, lives life for life itself because life is worth living for, unlike Griffith who throws away others just to fulfill his own dreams and can never have the satisfaction of earning his wishes through hard work.\
The rest of the characters range from excellent to good; Griffith is himself a great character and very effective villain. He's one of those villains who are so monstrously evil you can't help but hate them but at the same time, he is still very complex and he did start out likable. Casca is also a great female lead before and after the eclipse. Before it, she was a badass chick who warmed up for Guts and learned that there was more to life outside the mercenary band she lived with. After the eclipse, she serves more as Guts' only reason to live, the chain that holds him from falling off into becoming a downright villain.\
Guts companions like Farnese, Schierke, Serpico, Isidoro and everyone's favorite, Puck are also great although Isidoro and Puck unfortunately have been the butt of too many pointless jokes recently. They all pass through some character development and Puck himself is like Casca after the eclipse a morality chain to Guts. It's even referred to in story.\
Then we have the artwork. Google Berserk manga and you'll immediately see why everyone loves the artwork. Almost every page is like an Albrecht Durer woodcut with its detail and expressions. It's just beyond brilliant. Pity it takes a very long time to release a chapter because of that...\
Now for the bad stuff. Firstly, recently Berserk has been engaging in a lot of comedy and jokes. Even Berserk isn't immune to 'chibbiness' and when 'chibbiness' was used in the early volumes like when Guts playfully spanked Casca (her and Griffith's 'WTF' reaction makes me laugh so much) or Puck's 'chestnut mode' and his short-term memory (chibi godhand, oh my gosh), it was hilarious. But when you have a character like Isidoro acting like a monkey or a serious character like Schierke becoming really super-deformed like a blob monster like in the recent 'Sea God arc', it really distracts from the very serious story and just looks awkward and out of place. I mean, when was Berserk ever meant to be funny? Even Puck has been reduced to nothing but a joke character.\
\
The 'Sea God arc' itself while not bad didn't reach the usual quality of Berserk. Captain Sharkrider was very annoying and out of place and the nature of the mermaids themselves was really clichéd and uninspired. However, there were still a lot of awesome moments in that arc and the business that was happening with Griffith's side of the story more than made up for this lackluster-by-Berserk-standards arc. The first two and a half volumes, or until Guts meets and fights with the Count are rather bland. While cool, they're not really well written and essentially are what you call senseless violence. Also, the art was average.\
However, none of these flaws take away from the story or experience. In conclusion, Berserk is a very well done epic with some of the greatest and most memorable characters ever and one heck of an inspiring protagonist. I give it 9 out of ten and not a full 10. Why? Yes it's a masterpiece but it's not finished yet and only the future knows how awesome the ending will be. If it is going to be as awesome is not more than expected, I will certainly bring it to a ten. Right now, Berserk deserves a 9 in my opinion.",

    Please note: this review is a warning, and is focused primarily upon the start of the manga. The manga is, of an overwhelming proportion, garbage, would be the warning. Don't take this lightly. And don't think I'm being unfair to the manga; this is merely the objective truth.\
This manga is thoroughly terrible in nearly every possible way; art (ugly and disgusting), story (there is none), and characters (stock characters with no depth, ego, or even self-awareness). \
The art: Comparing the artwork in chapter 318 with that in chapter 3, Guts somehow managed to get uglier (ever so slightly), and the thought of seeing his ugly\
          \
        face for 300 or so chapters would be absolutely unbearable. There are many characters that aren't so hard on the eyes (though manymore expendable ones who are) in the manga, but Guts will be there to torment you for good. The art style is detailed however, and remains relatively consistent. The monsters and such—rather, the humans, which are synonymous in Beserk--are graphically disgusting, vile, aand gross, which was perhaps intentional, with the purpose of contrasting with Guts’s own character design; however, I cannot approve of a foil between the bad, the ugly and uglier. Don't read with a weak stomach.\
Characters: So in the beginning, ugly bastard just chops his enemies down, and generally acts like an ass towards everyone he meets, and they, normally monsters and abominations respond in kind. The only other character outside of this pattern is simply \"there,\" and hangs around Guts for no real reason. An absence of sentient life; the cast is essentially a huge cast of monsters and abominations.\
Story: Guts chops up his enemies and acts like a psychopath, which to be fair, correlates with the title, Berserk. Finally, he is shown to have some history, but is pretty irrelevant. Everything that happens is rather generic and painfully boring, and is made even worse by the art and character designs.\
Note again; this review is a warning to anyone starting this manga; you're going to be digging through a lot of crap before you get to anything good; expect a godawfully long and boring read through volumes of  disgusting, mindless, and and tasteless violence.\
Of course, it must be possible for people to get through the beginning, since the ratings are positively skewed. If you are able to stand Guts’s character design for hundreds of chapters. If you are that intent on reading this manga, I recommend \"skipping to the good parts\" assuming they exist. If you do enjoy the ugly and grotesque, this manga is certainly for you.",

    Berserk is one of the best long-running manga of all time. Its story is very interesting and its characters are are unique. Although the Golden Age Arc is a little too slow as it is supposed to be only a prologue but still keeps you engaged nonetheless. The plot is full of unpredictable twists and you really start to feel the struggle the characters are going through. The artwork is highly detailed and only gets better as the series goes on. One of my biggest gripes I had with the series is that it sometimes tries too hard to shock the audience with its uncomfortable\
          \
        situations such as demons raping characters (yes you read that correctly), torture, etc. Needless to say, this manga is not for everyone. If you're one of those people who can't handle seeing gore you might want to stay away from Berserk because it does not hold back.\

    Welcome to Berserk!\
Story: The story is one of the main factors of Berserk and its very good. Some arcs worth pointing out are the Golden Age, Falcon of the Millennium Empire, and the Conviction arcs. The story revolves around imagery and the characters.\
Art: The beginning chapters during the black swords man arc and the first half of the Golden Age arc isn't as good as the rest, its above average don't get me wrong but compared to the god like art work and details that come in later chapters its no where near the same. Once you get into the Conviction arc than later into\
          \
        the Falcon of the Millennium Empire arc you'll see a huge jump in quality and details. \
Characters: The main focus is the relationship between Guts and Griffith, their relationship on why its so good isn't easily explain and is best experienced. Other than that we see the character development of Guts and how he changes in his life and some interesting and good side characters even though one might not be to your liking. \
Enjoyment: For the most part Berserk is the best Dark Fantasy manga that you can read right now and I love it, its one of those edgy stories that actually works and is edgy because of the plot and not because its edgy just to be edgy. \
Overall: If you like dark and gritty stories or just like good character development with some of the best art styles in Manga I suggest reading this.  \

    Berserk.... What is there to say about Berserk that has not already been said ? This manga ladies and gentlemen, this manga has it all. This is a story of vengence, a story of friendship, a story of love, a story of betrayal, the story of a mere mortal, a man, fighting against fate itself. There are no other manga like Berserk and once you start reading berserk your standart for greatness will become Berserk.\

    Berserk, é difícil escrever sobre a maior experiência que já tive o prazer de desfrutar. Vou tentar ser um pouco breve.\
Berserk não se trata apenas de um mangá medieval e violento, trata-se de sentimentos, emoções humanas. Tudo isso sendo escrito e desenhado dá forma mais sublime e bela possível. Miura kentaro foi capaz de transformar tudo aquilo que grotesco, sórdido, sujo e podre, em arte. Em berserk temos personagens muito bem construídos, com suas motivações, traumas, convicções, desejos, ambições e SONHOS. Além de ser uma história muito bem construída, estamos também em universo fantástico, onde o autor nos apresenta criaturas mágicas e espirituais, seres de\
          \
        outras dimensões e com bastante referência a clássicos, por exemplo: HP Lovecraft, mitologias Nórdica, Tolkien, Hellraiser.\
Berserk é um mangá que entra não apenas no Hall dos melhores mangás já escritos, ele é uma das melhores obras já feitas na história dá humanidade. E a minha favorita.\

    What do you usually think about when you hear the word 'Epic'? \
According to Google the proper term is: \"..is essentially a large user story that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories. It may take several sprints to complete an epic. An Epic can span more than one project, if multiple projects are included in the board to which the epic belongs.\"\
 Berserk is such a story, an Epic.\
~Story~ 10/10\
In a reflection to the medieval crusades spanning from 1095 – 1291CE we can get a good understand of the time period of Berserk. If we can't pin out a time period\
          \
        that reflects our own it's hard to relate to the story itself. Berserk takes this reflection in two different ways. The Crusades and/or The 100 Years War.\
However, the 100 years war would come first, the battle for Midland, and the 'Crusade' being the ordeal with the Kushan/Band of the Falcon.\
Now that we have an understand of 'when' this period takes place we can understand the story better.\
~Art~ 10/10\
The style of Berserk is a mix of Lovecraftian horror and the beauty of Kentaro Miura's hand. When I flip the page of a physical copy it's almost like I'm witnessing a painting. Miura's work really pulls you in, and it get's better over the years. When you start reading the first volume of Berserk you'l be tugged at, by the 6th volume you'l be grasped and pulled under.\
~Character~ 10/10\
What makes excellent characters? Excellent well thought out character development. I care for these characters I've invested time into these characters. Berserk isn't essentially 'dragged out' because of plot development, but rather because of the people within the plot. The plot doesn't make the story, the characters do. For example Guts evolves from a cocky mercenary to a well minded man, even at points a caring person. We know the stress he can go under when dawning the Berserker Armour, you may not see it, but he's concerned more for his companions than for himself. It took a long time and it brings a tear to my eye to see such a well developed character who has been through so many tribulations that he can now reflect on others' emotions when at one time he could not. Almost every character is 'drawn' out like this, by chapter 190 Guts' Travelling Party is solidified, one of the best band of heroes to ever hit my eyes.\
~Enjoyment/Overall~ 11/10\
I could not put this manga down, the complex Epic tale of Guts the Black Swordsman and his quest to seek not only revenge but answers intrigues me so much. I can't wait for the coming chapter in early 2017.",

    Berserk is the best fantasy manga I've ever read. With that, I'm now going to start with the negatives. I love it, but it still has it's flaws. \
- The first three volumes: before it gets to the hailed Golden Arc, the first 3 volumes are boring, edging onto cliched and while I was reading them, I was genuinely feeling disappointed throughout, as I had been given high expectations when reading some reviews on here. Thankfully, it gets better after those three volumes, but just be warned that they are not great. \
- Nearly everyone is in love/is a fan of the protagonist. (That ol'\
          \
        cliche) \
- Puck is irritating as comic relief (though he gets thankfully less and less screentime)\
- Sometimes it feels like it's being unecessarily dark: you will see a *lot* of scenes where women are being raped by disgusting looking creatures and when scenes like this happen nearly every arc, it gets tiring and feels gross. This is more personal preference than anything else, it's not a thing I particularly enjoy reading about. \
The last one is probably my main gripe with the series, the rest I can quite happily forgive because of the outweighing positives. \
\
Story: The storyline is ridiculously engaging, and despite the manga being so long (a little less than 350 chapters as of this review), there are hardly any \"filler\" arcs. If an arc isn't focusing on Guts, it will be focusing on Griffith or it will be focusing on any other of the main characters. This is refreshing, compared to something like One Piece (which is a solid favourite of mine) which can easily dip into \"filler\" arcs every so often. \
The world building is excellent and you feel like you understand the world that Guts lives in, without having to have a stupid amount of background context or story explaining everything. The reasons for the wars and the fighting makes sense and there isn't an overcomplicated political plot - politics are not hashed out constantly so the reader gets bored. \
\
Art: The art isn't great at first - like with all mangakas - but it gets better and better. The recent chapters are beautiful to read and the amount of work that goes into complicated backgrounds shows. When things start to get fantastical, you get that coming through so clearly and magically in the manga and it is wonderful to read. \
\
Character: Characters are really a strong point for me in Berserk, all of the main characters feel real and have their own distinct personalities and opinions, as well as their own flaws. To me, I would say that Berserk actually comes into its own not after the Golden Arc, but actually when Guts starts travelling with another group of characters later on in the story. \
\
On the whole, Berserk is a wonderful fantasy manga that really grips you into reading. It plays around with the tropes of \"light\" and \"darkness\" a lot, but in a way different from most stories that I've read before and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of adventure/fantasy mangas. The way it deals with revenge is very refreshing and I have only praise for how it portrays such a vast and diverse group of characters. \

    If you're looking for a good read it should most definitely be this. Berserk will always probably be my favorite manga of all time the plot is A1 and kept me interested in it for a long time. I obviously got an overly biased opinion when it comes to berserk but I don't care its a review just read it especially if you enjoy reading Seinen and can't find nothing else to read.

    I was able to watch the anime adaptations first when I get hooked up in the story and decided to read the manga. The phasing of the story is very different from the anime so I'm hoping that the people who have watched and will watch will read it too because even if they have different phasing it's both enjoyable.\
The setting is really a wise idea, and the maturity of the story gave me a feeling that this is very different. Something is different with Berserk that you will continue to watch. What I also see in the story, although fantasy, it's very realistic! And\
          \
        I love it, not because of the maturity of the drawings or the situations of the story, but it's because of the decisions each characters are doing. \
It really shows how wanting a power can change a man.\
I was inspired by Guts or I could say that he is really my favorite because we both think the same. For others who haven't read it, once you see the crisis Guts have undergone you will understand why he did that. \
Overall, I love the story - very realistic and mature. And I just love it! Really fascinating story. \

    Before i say, or spoil anything, here's my short, spoiler free verdict - \
I do recommend this title to everyone, but with one condition - if you are prepared to have another half life 3 in your life, since this manga is pretty much the half life 3 of manga/ anime, as in only god knows when and if we'll ever get to see the ending. 8/10\
\
*contains spoilers, obviously*\
Well, my experience with the show and manga was quite the odd one (compared to actual fans) and by that i mean that i literally didn't have any involvement with this title until about a month ago\
          \
        (i'm writing this on july 09 2016). First i finally decided to look into the anime. Took me about two days to finish it. I couldn't rate it too high (7/10) due to the extremely dated visuals and somewhat slow parts of the story, but most of the show was still very enjoyable.\
What really got me interested though, is what happened after the eclipse, and since the end was a cliffhanger, i obviously had to know what comes next. Next came the long trial of trying to figure out the movies and eventually ending up on the forums, where i finally got convinced to try out the manga. And i am glad i did - immediately i was enjoying the great art it has, all the things the anime decided to drop and the continuation of the story.\
More than with the anime, i enjoyed the grim atmosphere the story has, the obvious aim of it to mature audience with not hesitating to perform the darkest and most vile of acts (gory slaughter, rape, and both of those don't discriminate between men, women, and even children...), and show them pretty much without any censorship at all. This is a truly adult title... Or so i thought. After the eclipse, things slowed down quite noticeably, and although it was still really interesting, it just kept and kept slowing down, until when apprentice boy and the witch came around, i finally noticed - the manga is nothing like it was before.\
Slowly, from an original title that had lots of interesting concepts and ideas behind it (well at least back when it came out) that where mostly not seen before, it became more and more like a standard Shounen title - the progression pretty much stopped, while the story started focusing on new main and side characters, distracted by fights that don't bring the hero any closer to his goal. Before you know it, Guts suddenly gained a \"dark side\" that gives him power but tries to take over, gets tons of friends and even a frigging harem that he opens to, gets an armor that grants him superpowers but works with his dark side, and the manga gets pretty preachy about the values of friendship and whatnot... Sounds familiar? It does to me, most Shounen title familiar in fact.\
And then, before i knew it, it ended. Well, not really, more like i caught onto it, but for me it felt like it, since i also understood that over the week that i read the manga from start to 'finish', i went over 26 YEARS worth of material. 26 years and you could finish it in a few days of reading, and what's worse, 26 years, and the ending seems as distant as it was after the eclipse, if not more. \
So then my final verdict - 8/10, and that's actually barely, i'd rank it 7.7/10 if i could. If i could separate it into 4, i'd rank it 9/10 for the first 3 fourths and 5/10 for the newer part (around when the witch came, or maybe a bit before that), but again, i have to put one mark on it as a whole, so too bad, since i'd prefer to rank the older stuff separately, it really was great. Now i'm probably going to drop it, at least until its complete (if it ever will be), since to me it looks like we can't expect an ending in the closest decade at the very least... ",

    This is my first review so i am sorry if its bad.\
I started reading berserk because of the cliffhanger ending that the anime left with, who couldn't resist!\
story: 9\
 i gave the story 9 because it's an interesting, original story line that makes you want to read on. usually fantasy story lines go over the top, but in this case berserk was just the right amount of gore, supernatural and war but it wasn't completely overrun by it. i don't want to give any spoilers, but if you have seen the anime the chapters where the anime leaves off, the story line starts getting more\
          \
        interesting. the only flaw in the story that i think it only deserves a 9 because some parts drag on a bit, the parts where the story has to develop and nothing much is happening.There is a lot of nudity and sex scenes in this manga but don't let this put you off if you're not a fan of that sort of stuff because it's not there for the fun it helps develop the story and characters.\
art: 10\
i gave the art 10 because every page in this manga is a piece of art work, Kentaro Miura's art is outstanding and if you are lucky enough to own a volume of this manga you will treasure it forever. The art is so detailed and very unique no others compare.\
character: 9\
the characters in berserk are portrayed perfectly, guts/gatts the swordsman goes through many hardships and his personality shown in the manga show realistically how he would be after these struggles. You can see the relationship between guts and griffith change and warp throughout the manga. Also you see the relationship between guts and casca develop, the emotions are portrayed perfectly.\
enjoyment: 9\
i don't give tens easily so i am only giving it a 9 for enjoyment. the art, the characters and the story line overall made it a very enjoyable manga and i can't wait for a new chapter.\
overall: 9\
as i said i don't give tens easily plus also the fact earlier about the story being boring in a few (very few) parts. the story is one of a kind and anyone even considering reading this manga should just go for it, it has everything gore, war, huge swords, battles,nudity, witches, trolls, demons, gods and touching relationships.\

    Berserk, is a disgusting story. It is a revolting story. However, above all, it is a human one.\
Yes, the famed Berserk manga is a great one, with great moments and great characters; but one not for the faint of heart. \
Story- 7\
The concept is very simple at first glance. Big man wielding big ass sword, goes around hunting demons. Along with its medieval setting, the basic synopsis is your typical revenge story. However, when digging a bit deeper, the story becomes much deeper and more captivating. You can really get a sense of drama and turmoil when it is demanded; and what I mean by\
          \
        that, is that author Kentaro Miura can convey a perfect sense of nail-bitting tension that tortures you while you await each new chapter. \
No where, is this more noticeable, than in the famed Golden Age Arc. The Golden Age Arc is my, as well as many other's, favourite arc of this entire series. Leading up to this arc, is a decent dose of character building, but when you get here, Miura's abilities as a writer is on display. \
\
This arc is, in my view, a lot more positive and upbeat compared to the rest of the manga, but that isn't a high bar to set. Characters form new interesting relationships with each other, and it is these relationships that add to the story's build-up, leading to fantastic moments where the story can effectively display a real sense of friendship, played out on the backdrop of huge wars and climatic battles that the medieval-era setting fits well with. However, I must give a very large warning, to the amount of...'profanity' found in this manga. Miura, much like G.R.R Martin, conveys the most disgusting parts of medieval society, such as violence, torture, rape, gang raping, slow rapes, and child raping. I often find myself EXTREMELY uncomfortable during these moments, but this only added to my hate of specific characters which I'm sure Kentaro wanted me to hate, and easily baited me to do so. \
Art-10\
While at the beginning of the series, the art can be slightly awkward at times, the quality takes leaps and bounds every volume. Kentaro can draw huge bombastic battle scenes displaying both the glorious, badass and gruesome sides of war, while also being able to create surreal moments of silence, where a single panel can contain so much emotion for the characters.\
Character-10\
Ah, yes. Here we are. While the story was good on its own, the entire series would have fallen flat on its back if not for its art, and more importantly characters. The characters in Berserk are very deep, as even the supporting cast are unique, and never feels like they're cookie-cutter models or made for the specific purpose of being a side character. Everybody feels like they can be the protagonist of their own spin-off, which makes it all the more heart-wrenching when they are emotionally and physically tortured. \
Of course, even though the supporting cast, like the Band of The Hawks, are great and all; nothing can compare to the two main characters: Griffith, and Guts. I wouldn't dare to spoil anything, but just know that their personalities are interesting and compelling on their own, but it is their relationship and way they work off each other, that I believe, is the centre of Berserk. \
Enjoyment-8\
My own personal enjoyment comes mostly from the outstanding art and character, for reasons that should be obvious for anybody who read up to this point. However, while my enjoyment would be higher, it is the previously mentioned scenes of grotesque horror that I gave this a lower score than I would. Please don't misunderstand; the scenes serve a purpose, and they serve it well, but that does not change the fact that I am utterly disgusted by it. \
Overall-9\
Overall, I recommend this to anybody who wishes to take a look at what great character and art can accomplish, but not to anybody who can't take some possibly very graphic panels/moments.\
Cheers.\

The ideology, philosophy and conflict in the story are identical to our history. But the story itself is really unpredictable. Guts is only human and yet he achieve a monster like strength through believable progress.\

The art is really artistic. There is always astonishing background that is drawn with such incredible details. Unlike other manga who don't give an effort to do so.\

     O melhor mangá que já li, sendo muito paciente ao desenvolver seus arcos e com traços incríveis. Infelizmente, o autor peca ao exagerar certas situações onde o sentido simplesmente some, fazendo parecer que Miura queria apenas divertir seu lado sádico.\
 Dividido em poucas histórias que duram anos para terminar, a mente de Kentaro cria um universo pouco rico, mas, muito imersivo, com personagens que são tão exagerados no seu lado mau, que para dizer que são bons, é necessário fazer figurantes ridículos de tamanha crueldade, o que não significa que não tenha um grande ponto de realidade.\
 Os desenhos são muito bons desde o\

        início de sua publicação, e o fato de não ser semanal, mesmo possuindo apenas 20 páginas por capítulo, faz com que o autor tenha muito mais tempo para trabalhar as incrivelmente detalhadas imagens que compõem o mangá.\

    Wow hey look it's another perfect 10 for one of the most beloved manga series of all time, what are the chances? Shouldn't I be rating this low so I can be a cool delinquent contrarian? \
Whatever, I still want to get my thoughts down, because not only is Berserk the best manga I've ever read, it's one of the best pieces of media I've ever consumed. I've read this damn thing 4 or 5 times all the way through (it's not even finished), and I'm always reminded as to why it's my favorite. Let's go down the list. \
Story - 9.5 to 10\
What a\
          \
        fucking ride. Most authors could look at the Golden Age arc alone and call that their magnum opus, but with Berserk it's simply an (albeit large) drop in the proverbial bucket. \
Arc after arc I find myself truly impressed at the way Kentaro Miura is able to keep the plot feeling fresh and active despite the story continuing for ~350 chapters. The twists and turns the plot speeds through are breakneck and oftentimes devastating. If you like your fiction light and happy this is not the manga you'll want to be reading. \
At its core I think Berserk is a character study on how constant and unrelenting torture and suffering can shape a character. Berserk is ugly, it's exhausting, it paints a picture of a cruel and uncaring universe where the very laws of causality fight against you, driving you to the edge of madness. Without that suffering, though, the beauty of this work would never be able to shine as brightly as it does. Those moments of reprise, where the characters can look around among themselves and breathe that well earned sigh of relief, even if it only lasts one night? That's what real beauty is in the world of Berserk. There's a scene a bit farther into the series where the characters are plodding along the shore of the ocean with a sunset painting the background. In fiction that's a rather common scene, it's beautiful, sure, and the picture it paints in your mind is relaxing. But in Berserk? In Berserk that scene might as well be the gates of heaven. The fact that fans reading this can point out this exact page and nod knowingly is the very reason Berserk is so special. \
As you might have noticed, I'm taking a tentative 0.5 points off in this section, and the reason for that is the PAINSTAKINGLY slow rate at which Miura works. This manga has been going on for 27 years and 4 months, and is currently still in hiatus until \"early 2017(tm)\".\
Art - 11? 12? More? \
For this section I could rant and rave about what a fucking incredible artist Miura is, or, I could save you a paragraph of writing and have you google \"Berserk full page art\". Scroll through Google Images until I've made my point. \
Characters - 10\
Honestly, the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that Guts is my favorite protagonist ever written. The characters here in Berserk are fully realized people with their own dreams, quirks, aspirations, regrets, and motivations. They're so much more than your average shonen protagonist who just wants to be \"the best\". \
Without its characters a story is nothing. That goes without saying, but Berserk delivers in spades. This manga had to have been written by an incredibly empathetic man who understood the essence of what makes a person a person. \
One of my favorite subtle examples of this is, is that sometimes, when Guts talks about Casca he starts to look more youthful, like you can see the shadow of how he once looked and carried himself. Like the past peeks out through his expressions. Words just can't describe how heartbreaking and beautiful it is to watch. \
Enjoyment - 10\
I love it, I will probably always love it. I may die before it's ever completed, or maybe Miura will kick the bucket first, I don't know. \
The point is: Berserk is a man's life work. It's something Kentaro Miura will and should always be remembered for. I really don't even know what else to say. \
Read it, even if you end up hating it. At least, if you enjoy manga as a medium, do yourself the service of reading up through The Golden Age arcs. Just do it, man. What else do you want me to say? \

    Berserk is a fantastic manga, perhaps one of the best ever written. However, you'll find plenty of praise here, and I'd like to say that normally, I'd give Berserk a 9/10, or even a 10/10. However, I'd like to focus on something in Berserk that may cause some people to not enjoy it. \
Berserk is dark. Like, seriously dark. Dark enough to make you wince and cry and hate the characters themselves. Most of the time, the darkness is very justifiable. One of the main villains is an extremely Machiavellian person, and will do whatever to succeed in life, whether it be selling his own\
          \
        body, letting someone die, or even worse things that I won't say to not spoil the plot. There is one incident at the end of the Golden Arc that I believe is entirely well done, and establishes a villain extremely well; but at the same time, it sets the stage for what I would consider an unnecessary amount of dark. Something in particular happens that has absolutely no purpose to the plot or characters. It is used as a cheap way to tug at your emotions and make you hate a certain antagonist much more than you otherwise would. \
From the end of the Golden Arc, there are several more instances of this. Whether it involves a character almost getting raped (this is actually the main tool, this happens far too often for absolutely no reason), or a merciless slaughter of a town (don't forget, one of the women is getting raped too), it just seems so pointless. I dare to say that Miura puts these instances in the Manga as an attempt to keep people interested, or even as a selling point for the manga. Berserk: The Darkest Manga Around. \
If you are someone who doesn't like this sort of pointless atrocity, you'll probably find yourself not enjoying several sections of the manga. I for one, enjoy these sections anyways for the most part, but I have enough insight to know that they are ultimately either a plot device, a tool to make me hate a character, or an easy way to say \"this guy is a villain.\" \
Recently, Miura has actually gotten better at this sort of thing. There hasn't been a rape/almost rape sequence in a number of volumes. In fact he introduced a whole league of villains without using the rape/slaughter tactic to make me hate them. \
Overall, Berserk is still easily one of the best Manga ever written, especially the Golden Arc, the Millennium Falcon arc, and whatever arc Guts gets a certain set of armor in.\

    I think this might be the best manga ever.\
The story is awesome and very enjoyable, maybe is a bit too much for young people, but to me is really good. The fights are really good and the plot that the story follows is great too. The story change and advance, in the beginning it is very realistic, it follows a medieval plot which is very realistic and in some point it started to get more and more fantastic, but without losing their way.\
The manga has a clearly action and adventure genre, but you can see gore and adult things around all the plot (sex, torture,\
          \
        rape, massacre, etc. ), in addition the further the plot goes the more fantastic it get, but this isn't a bad idea.\
In the art I don't have much to say, because I haven't seen a better one right now, I don't know if it is because this one is the best one or because I haven't seen enough, but right now to me this one is the best. \
In the characters there is a bit of everything, I really look up to Guts and the old Griffith, Casca and most of the members in the hack band are pretty good too, then there are some of then who for me are only to complete the story, like the boy who follows Farnese and some soldiers and people who Guts meets in his trip\
There are also some character that are trash for me, like the elf who follows Guts and the others who appear later, Isidro is pretty annoying too and then some villains who are so stupid for me (I don't remember most of the names and some of them are people with a small role)\
The enjoyment is complete for me and I thing that it is the same for people who like the gore, the good plots and the good quality in the manga. I really get hooked on it for a while, then I realized that the chapters took so long to be made and I decided to stop before starting other arc, my heart wouldn't stand the waiting between the chapters making.\
Overall the manga has a bit of every thing that I look up in a manga, the plot and characters are awesome, the art is fantastic too, because of it you really enjoy the manga, but this is also a bad thing, because after seeing this one you wouldn't probably find another one as good as this and because you won't be able to resist the temptation of reading and when you reach the unfinished arc you will get mad waiting for the next chapter to complete the arc.\

    STORY:\
At first you won't get into the story that much, atleast not till Baron Arc imo, but still the actions are good more than good enough to get into the manga imo. But once the Golden Arc starts the story starts to get better and better to a level where you cannot get out, and will probably restart reading while waiting for new chapter. Insane twists and pace.\
ART:\
Well, I started following berserk at around 2002-2003 and the artwork at that time did not looked bad for the initial chapters, but when I went through them for the \"i do not remember how many times\" they\
          \
        feel a bit lower quality than rest of the manga, the visual improvement over the chapters is quite mesmerizing. \
CHARACTER:\
Personally I think this manga has one of the best character development.\
OVERALL: this has been one of the longest running manga that never stopped me from jumping at the new chapter, no matter how many and how long the breaks are, at the same time it also never gave me the feeling that \"okay it has gone long enough, maybe they should end it now, or damn for taking this long to release a new chapter\". I would rather wait for the creator to take his time and maintain his standard, than rushed chapter.\

 A bit of a pyromaniac (and possibly a pyrophiliac), Farnese's habit of maniacally burning things she didn't like, along with her lack of empathy due to her poor upbringing provoked her to hunt down and burn supposed witches and pagans at the stake. This fueled a secret sadistic pleasure that she constantly tried to deny.\
 \
 She and Serpico left their Holy See positions after her faith was shattered during the devastation of Albion and the events surrounding Griffith's reincarnation. She then chose to follow Guts in hopes of learning more about the world and has changed into a more sympathetic human being. Since then, Farnese has begun to study witchcraft under Schierke's tutelage. Farnese also seems to have developed a crush on Guts which becomes evident in chapter 287 and 288 of the manga.\
 \
 Farnese is primarily Casca's care taker and thus rarely involves herself in battles. She and Casca both received enchanted chainmail shirts made of silver as well as a silver short sword for protection against creatures from the astral plane. During Ganishka's raid on Vritanis, she also received a trio of snake-like homonculi created by Schierke from thorn vines which Farnese remote controls with a vine ring.\

 \
 Believing that he is destined for greater things than the average man, Griffith is willing to sacrifice everything for the dream of his own kingdom and only values others so far as they are useful to him. The one exception seems to be Guts and Casca, both of whom he confides to in private moments. The source of his ambition is a Behelit given to him by a fortune teller she claimed was \"The Egg of the King,\" which could lead an average person to becoming King himself.\

 Guts is the protagonist of the story. He is a tall, muscular man with a huge sword called the Dragon Slayer, a prosthetic left forearm that has a magnetic grip which also conceals a cannon. Guts is a tragic hero; he is born as one who may be able to struggle against Causality, but seemingly unable to affect it on a large scale.\
 \
 Note: His name has often times been translated by some English scanlation groups as \"Gatts,\" or \"Gutts,\" or \"Gattsu.\" However, the official translation provided to Dark Horse Comics by Kentaro Miura himself, is in fact, \"Guts.\"\

Puck can secrete a powder from his wings to quickly heal wounds and can emit a bright flash to blind enemies. On occasion, he also resorts to his \"Bloody Needle\" attack, tossing a spiny object resembling a seed pod at someone. It deals no injury, but is painful enough to prompt most victims to cry out. Puck was the first to join Guts's journey, and is starting to show a strange attachment to the Behelit Guts took upon his battle with the Count. \
 Puck often serves as comic relief along with Isidro. The two are frequently drawn in an exaggerated manner. He is very angry when he ever is mixed up with a Pixie or Fairy quick to state the difference. He also seems to have a brother-sister relationship with the newest comic relief character the female elf Evarella.\

 After a series of events, Schierke was forced to leave her home and Flora behind forever when they faced an attack Griffith ordered. Schierke, having lived a sheltered life, doesn't like the Human world or the Holy See's religion, but she finds life outside bearable due to her companions.\
 \
 Her magic skills and knowledge of the world are impressive for a child her age. One of her most used and handiest spells is the ability to hypnotize or temporarily desensitize others. But due to her youth, she tends to exhibit dangerous overzealousness. Her ability to sense \"Od\" (life force or spirit energy) means she can sense the power, intent, and alignment of all creatures and artifacts.\
 \
 As she sees Isidro as an incompetent monkey, there is some friction between the two, which frequently lends itself to comic situations. Though she initially couldn't stand Guts, Schierke has developed a slight infatuation with him and both now share a father-daughter relationship. When Sonia gave her an offer to join the Band of the Hawk, Schierke thought of Guts before declining. Their journey together constantly brings them into even deeper understanding.\

 Despite Farnese's childhood abuse and her forcing him to burn his own mother at the stake, he cares deeply for his half-sister. Serpico was her servant since she found him beaten on a snowy street over a decade ago.\

 Serpico's relationship with Guts has forever been plagued with animosity, due in large part to the dangers that inevitably surround Guts and anyone he takes into his Band. After a duel with Guts in the underground pillars of Vritannis, Guts spared his life. Their bond rekindled, and Serpico has since learned to trust Guts to protect Farnese when he can not.\

 Serpico uses two items blessed by the wind spirit Sylph in order to battle with tolerance alongside Guts: a rapier that can generate razor sharp gusts of wind; and a cloak that constantly generates a swirling vortex around its wearer which can deflect projectiles, assist in jumping, and slow falls from great heights.\

Sometime later, during a mission by Gambino and his men, Guts observes Donovan killing off stragglers from the opposing force before shooting him in the back. Guts fires another bolt into Donovan's open mouth and shoves his sword down Donovan's throat, killing him without getting any closure if Gambino was responsible until he had an altercation with his guardian years later.\

 Irvine's precision with the bow is peerless. He is able to fire off several arrows simultaneously with unerring accuracy. The bow itself seems to funnel quite a bit of power into its arrows; foes hit at the neck find themselves headless. In his Apostle form his legs are replaced by a large wolf creature with horns and the same demonic eye as his bow and his body is now covered in fur and his face looks similar to that of a werewolf. In this new form he is able to remove and twist his tail hairs in to arrows and his horns can be used as a crossbow with string made from the horns. Once these arrows from his tail pierce the target they suddenly grow unusually large spikes with the shape of a root that perforate the target's body completely. He has formed a close bond with Sonia, who has taken to riding him as a mount during the final battle with Ganishka.\

He is often seen to be attended by many very young male servants, no older than being in their teens. Gennon's voice was done by Masashi Oki in the Japanese version of the original anime and Fred Velde was his English voice actor. \
 Gennon later rose to become Governor of Doldrey. When General Boscone reveals that the Band of the Hawk's leader is Griffith, his obsession starts to cloud his judgement, which would eventually lead to his defeat.\
 When the Band of the Hawk attacked Doldrey as part of Midland's regular army during the One Hundred Years War, Gennon became so obsessed with capturing Griffith to the detriment of his greater military objectives. Chuder lost the battle, in large part because Gennon overrode the military command structure and took direct control of Chuder's forces, which was all in Griffith's plan. In his final moments, he pleaded with Griffith, telling him that all he wanted was to have him back. This plea fell upon deaf ears as Gennon was killed by Griffith after the main part of Chuder's army fled the battlefield following the death of General Boscone at Guts's hands.\

Zodd first encountered and defeated Guts and Griffith during a castle raid, ultimately deciding to spare them upon realizing Griffith's crimson behelit and Guts' inevitable fate. Zodd has had a long standing rivalry with Skull Knight, along with Guts as he increasingly became a more capable opponent. \
 Zodd eventually found the \"Ultimate Strong One\" in Griffith, instantly being defeated by the Hawk of Light within a dream and costing him his left horn. Afterwards, his search for his ultimate opponent was over, he swore his servitude to Griffith in the new Band of the Hawk. He serves the new Band in many of the same roles that Guts served in the old one, including being Griffith's right hand man, most trusted confidant, and strongest warrior. Zodd's ability to fly made possible both Griffith's rescue of Charlotte and Guts' attack on Ganishka at Vritannis.\
 \
 As both a reminder of his defeat and to make the fact he is a replacement of Guts in this new band of Hawk very clear, his left horn has never regrown like Guts' missing right eye. His reason for joining the band of Hawk is much like Guts' also mainly because he was defeated by Griffith.\

As part of Magnifico's plan to join the Vandimion name with the royal Eath family, Roderick agreed to be Farnese's fiancé. His obvious motivations for this arranged marriage are the vast opportunities and support the Vandimion name could bring him, but he seems to take a personal interest in the heiress as well due to her reputation. \
 \
 Roderick has been used as a way for the author to delve into Guts' deeper psyche by asking him questions about himself and Casca. Guts approves of his naval prowess, as indicated in the fight against the pirates. It is not known whether Roderick is in love with Farnese, but he does try to win her affection, even in the delicate matter concerning her own affection for Guts. \
 \
 Roderick, with his long black ponytail, his good looks and devil-may-care attitude, is an excellent charmer and a decent swordsman, and demonstrates a willingness to fight the demons, even though he is ill equipped to take them on. He is currently ferrying Guts and company aboard his ship, on their way to Skellig.\

 Roderick and his crew also have a claim to fame on the high seas: His ship, the Sea Horse, downed 5 Tudor vessels on its own, thus earning Roderick the title of \"Prince of the Seas\".\

 He and Isidro think very much in the same line in presence of women.\

After Guts defeated Griffith in their duel, Griffith slept with Charlotte and was imprisoned and tortured for a year as a result. During that time, Charlotte continued to pine over Griffith and eventually was the one who provided the route for the Hawks to rescue him from prison. \
 Two years after the Eclipse, Midland was conquered by the Kushans and she was taken prisoner by Ganishka with the view of becoming his wife. Even in captivity, she spent all of her time making embroidery portraits of Griffith, dreaming of his return. Soon after the events at Albion, Griffith did return for her and used Zodd to fly her and Anna out of captivity. \
 \
 She is currently traveling with the new Band of the Hawk alongside Griffith, to whom she is betrothed. She recently declared The Band of the Hawk to be Midland's Regular Army after their resounding victory against the Kushans in Vritannis. Sonia referred to her as the \"Queen of the Ducks\".\

Her motivation for doing so was the legend of a child named Peekaf who believed himself an Elf and in doing so lost his human parents. She refers to herself as the Queen of the Elves and her true form is a monstrous female Luna Moth. Dwelling in the Misty Valley, she terrorized a nearby village, sending an army of insect demons disguised as elves to eat the town's livestock and people, as well as capturing children that she transformed into more insect demons via cocoons. Guts, Puck, and Rosine's former friend Jill travelled to the Misty Valley to confront Rosine, who offered to make Jill an elf apostle. Jill was tempted by the promise of flight, but was uneasy with the warlike ways of the elf demons who would kill each other for fun. Guts found and destroyed the elf demon cocoons, and an enraged Rosine battled Guts until she was so badly injured that she could no longer fight. As Guts was about to deliver a killing blow, Jill shielded Rosine with her body. It did nothing to stop Guts, but before he could act, Jill's father arrived and shot him with an arrow. Guts was then attacked by the Holy Iron Chain Knights, led by Farnese. Mortally wounded, Rosine finally understood the moral of Peekaf's fable and in her delirium attempted to return home to her parents but ultimately succumbed to her injuries and fell from the sky to her death. In some translations, she is referred to as Roshinu. Rosine makes a cameo in the 22nd episode of the anime. Rickert spots her hovering over the middle of a lake before the camp is attacked by other apostles, and she is seen standing apart from the horde as they devour the wounded Hawks. \

Though ominous and macabre, he is an enemy of the Godhand and its acolytes, hunting down Apostles and devouring their Behelits; especially bitter is his rivalry with Zodd the Immortal, whom he was often showed to overwhelm with ease.  \
 He wields a powerful sword that, when stuck down his throat, becomes a terrible, Behelit-coated blade capable of slashing rifts through reality itself, thus allowing the Skull Knight to move freely around the world or even between different dimensions. \
 \
 This enigmatic knight saved Guts in more than one occasion, notably during the infamous Eclipse which saw Griffith become a member of the Hand of God or when Slan almost slaughtered him, though he never explained why, simply declaring that the Struggler (the way he calls Guts) has to keep following his fate.\
 It is heavily speculated that, during his life as a mortal, the Skull Knight was in fact Gaiseric, the warlord that unified the Midland and became its first Emperor, notorious for his helmet whose shape was that of a human skull and whose ambitions 'prompted God to send four Angels' (most likely the four members of the Hand of God) to punish him.\
 He was the wearer of the Berserker's Armor, and knew the witch Flora. During the duel between Griffith and Ganishka he suddenly appeared out of thin air through a dimensional rift, trying to land a fatal blow on the Hawk, only to see it diverted on the writhing body of the Kushan Emperor.\

After a tumultuous childhood, he finally finds someone he respects and believes he can trust, only to have everything fall apart when this person takes away everything important to Guts for the purpose of fulfilling his own desires. Now marked for death, Guts becomes condemned to a fate in which he is relentlessly pursued by demonic beings. Setting out on a dreadful quest riddled with misfortune, Guts, armed with a massive sword and monstrous strength, will let nothing stop him, not even death itself, until he is finally able to take the head of the one who stripped him—and his loved one—of their humanity.
