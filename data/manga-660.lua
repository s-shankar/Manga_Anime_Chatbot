    Since there is no review of this beautiful manga, I'll try to make one. It's my first rewiew, please bear with me.\
\
Story 10/10\
The manga tells the story of France during the reign of Marie Antoinette through the eyes of Oscar Francois de Jarjeyes, better known with Lady Oscar. She was a young woman who was raised as a male due to the desire of his father to have a son who has skills to serve the royal family. \
At the age of 14, Oscar becomes Captain of the Imperial Guard, protector of the new princess of France, Marie Antoinette and this is how Oscar witnessed\
          \
        several social transformations in France. The story is very well wirtten and very well made, the author has done a great job, since it is not easy to make a manga with real history, you cannot change anything since it would lose meaning and credibility and that she has managed to put a fictional character like Oscar and some others without changing anything of the real history, is something to highlight. (Well at least to me since I can’t do that with my OCs).\
Ok moving on.\
Art 9/10\
I wasn't a big fan of her art at first I have to say that but as I was reading it I fell in love with it like when I finished I was like \"Wow that was beautiful\". The art helps you to get more involved in the story, it captures the love, the pain, the sadness, happiness, everything that the characters felt as the story progresses and today, I can say, that the art of this manga is one of my favorites so far. I love it I love it I love it. Of course its kinda \"vintage\" because this manga is old lol.\
Character 10/10\
The best part of this wonderful manga. All the characters are amazing and have a great development. Starting with Oscar she is the soul of the story, in fact she was not going to be a main character but she was so popular that she stole the story and If you read it you will know why. Since we follow the life of Oscar, André, Marie Antoinette (and others) since they were little kids, we literrally grow up with them and that's amazing because you can see how they faced their problems and overcame them.\
Oscar is the soul of the story really. All the time Oscar knows that she is a woman even tough she never had the chance to \"behave\" like one like her older sisters, her father even apologized at the end because he took that \"life\" away from her but Oscar instead thanks him for the way she was raised. Ugh I love her so much.\
The relationships between real and fictional characters don't seems forced at all, they are so well made I often find myself questioning if Oscar wasn't a real person at along? I still hope she was, ok moving on.\
Enjoyment 10/10\
This is one of my favorites mangas and yes I'm being biased but what can I say I love it so much. Actually I want to re-read it now (no matter when you see this).\
\
Overall 10/10\
I don't much left to say just that this manga is worth to be readed. Perhaps the anime is not the best and leave several things out, things that really matter but The Rose of Versailles has a lot to give and you will not regret I swear.\
It may be tedious, since the story is developing in accordance with the historical facts but that's the way it has to be, I loved the realness of it. This is a shoujo manga by the way so of course there's romance, broken hearts, love triangles, comedy, drama and some lesbian feelings too.\
Hope you like it and enjoy it as much as I did.\
\
See you in my animelist. Bye bye~\
