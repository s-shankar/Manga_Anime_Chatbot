		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=76,   ["text"]="             \n    Hellsing was part of my introduction to anime and as such it is one of my favourite fandoms. But it has only kept its place there because of its unique way of capturing the reader with action that I can only describe as being kick arse.\nThere is a great plot to this manga, well thought out and very grand. Being an action manga there are quite a few pages which are full of just pictures, no words, but yet the plot still unfolds well and is not lost.\nDue to\n          \n        everything that is going on in the manga you wouldn't think there is much time for character development. Indeed most characters are already well defined and do not change much during the course of the story, staying true to their personality/nature throughout. Seras Victoria however shows many changes as she adapts to her vampiric life, changes which are understandable, believable and handled well.\nI would have to say that great characters and a well thought out plot are the strengths of this story. Combine it with the art work and superb action and you have one of the best mangas around.\nA bad side to the mangas? There can be too much gore for some readers, and some may find it too be too heavy in action. But personally my only disappointment is the length of time between volumes, but that's nothing to do with the actual quality of the manga.\nAll in all read it. If you've seen the series be prepared for a heavier, one could say better, plot. If you haven't seen the series watch it as well as reading the manga, they are quite different. And no matter what keep your eyes out for the OAV because it promises to be good.\nNanashi Moriko - Most definitely a fan girl for Hellsing\n13/06/06\n"},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=59,   ["text"]="          \n    WARNING: This review contains an opinion that may differ from your own. I ask that you please read it with an open mind. If you're a fan of this manga/anime, hey I'm completely okay with that. I respect your opinion. Just how you should respect mine.                                                           \n          \n\n I know I'll get some hate for this, but whatever, this must be said. When you create a manga, there are three things that you can judge it on. First is the characterization, then the story and lastly the art. Hellsing fails when it comes to story and characterization. Before I go any further, I'll tell you right now there will be some very minor spoilers but there's nothing that will ruin the series for you and I'll warn you ahead of time.                                                  \n\nThe story takes place in the United Kingdom where the British government employs a special group named the Hellsing organization. They  defend the country from things that go bump in the night. It' run by Sir Integra; (SPOILER UP AHEAD) it was originally started by her great grandfather, the notorious vampire hunter, Abraham Van Helsing. They incorporate a powerful vampire named Alucard. So yeah, you can kind of see where this is going, the Hellsing manga is like one of those \"what if\" stories. In this case, it's with Bram Stroker's \"Dracula\" Novel where instead of killing the count, Abraham Van Helsing keeps him alive and uses him to fight off demonic entities, vampires and ghouls(SPOILERS ARE OVER). I won't go any further, because I don't want to ruin what's left of the story (which isn't that much anyways).              \n\n Hellsing's narrative is really lacking, there isn't much depth and it doesn't engage you. Not to mention, it's way too simple (especially for a seinen manga), and isn't that multi-layered or complex aside from a plot twist that occurs towards the end of the series. I wouldn't have had a problem with it if the manga was shorter, but at 92 chapters, I was expecting more story. Obviously, Kouta Hirano knew this, so he needed a way to entertain the reader; which was to throw in a whole bunch of action and graphic bloody violence to the point where it became borderline exploitation. I remember reading Hellsing up to the halfway point and kept asking myself when will the story take off? It never did. Even though the story isn't that well written, I'll admit it's very well paced and there's always a smooth transition from one scene to the next.                                                    \n\nNow on to the character's, okay let me start off by saying that Alucard has to be one of my all time favorite characters in all of manga and anime. He is the definition of badass and is a great example of the anti-hero. It's always fun to see him destroy his enemies mentally and physically. Not only that, but his whole persona and appearance is memorable. With his red duster and hat, to his large pistols and circular framed glasses. Of all the characters in the manga he had the most depth and was the most fleshed out. But still, he could have gotten a little more development. You couldn't imagine how frustrated I got when finally, we were given some back ground info on him but it turns out that it was only about 5 or 6 pages worth of material. Then it went back to nonstop action and violence. :(  Furthermore, as for the others, they got little to no characterization whatsoever. For example, Seras Victoria, she barely got any development. Aside from trying to adapt as a newly turned vampire, there wasn't much else to her. About  midway through, I began thinking that Kouta Hirano just put her in there because she had big tits. Don’t get me wrong, Seras is put to good use in the series but she just lacks  depth. Like Alucard, we only get a small amount of info on her past later on in the manga. The same thing applies to the other characters as well. Sure, some of them had personalities that might make one stand out from  another, but they were all one sided and flat. As I read further on, it became apparent that Hirano was too caught up with making them look cool and badass when they're fighting. And so, he completely forgot to develop them.                                                             \nFinally the art, the best part about the Hellsing manga; the manga author may not be able to write, but he sure can draw. The character designs are distinctive and fit perfectly for this horror themed manga. Implementing thick lines into the designs was an interesting idea. Backgrounds were very detailed and crisp as well. Although, Hellsing’s art doesn't start out that great in the first 8-10 chapters (especially the design for Alucard). But by volume 3, it changes for the better.\n\n All in all, Hellsing is a mediocre Seinen manga in my opinion. If you're looking for great storytelling and Characterization, look someplace else (Berserk, Vinland Saga and Monster). But if you want action and graphic violence then you’ll probably enjoy this. My suggestion to you is go watch Hellsing Ultimate instead, it’s a very faithful OVA adaptation of this manga. It’s a little more enjoyable than its counterpart  because there is an OST, animation and of course, Crispin Freeman’s AMAZING dub performance. This all distracts you from the fact that the story and characterization isn't so great. So I think  you’ll definitely have a more enjoyable experience with that.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=31,   ["text"]="            \n    Hellsing throws you into a dark world where monsters and humans coexist and do battle. Think of Bram Stroker's \"Dracula\" meeting the James Bond series, with a modest touch of fantasy. If your a person who enjoys being succinctly entertained with fast paced action and dialogue, then this is the manga for you. From an American's outlook, I could see where the Japanese lines blended with western comic ideals. Many characters are presented from  different, competing groups, trying to hold dominion over the others for various iconographic reasons(God, Country, Money, Power, Abilities). It just seemed much more up front than some mangas I've read\n          \n        where things usually are more subtle at first. Not Hellsing though, from the moment you start reading you are thrown into the midst of essentially, a fast bloody short story with rising action, climax and the falling action. Not to say that the manga didn't try to delve deeper into the obsession over war, pursuit of perfection, and the preciousness of life. These are only a few of the themes that were blended with the fast paced plot for a thought provoking, but albeit entertaining story. \nThe story isn't very grand in terms of details, but it allows the reader to focus on a few integral characters at a time, which becomes more exciting as they all join together right before the climax.With the exception of the abrupt ending, most of the plot revolves around the main character and his anti hero actions towards evil. I enjoyed seeing all of the situations pitted against Alucard, and  how his seemingly never ending powers dealt with them. I was bugged at first that it was just fight after fight, but towards the middle a greater battle is taken up and the fights more or less become the story. It made for good and mildly original entertainment.\nThe art in Hellsing matched the story perfectly. To say it was just \"cool\" or \"dark\" is an understatement. Every character has their own feel to them through their drawings. Integra is always collected and in charge with her cigarette smoke. Walter is respectful but yet mysterious with his eye piece shining, and Allucard oozes dark, fearful power. Its too long to go into, but every character almost seems evil do to the nature of the story and how it fits so well with the art. No one is perfect and the art reflects that idea well.\nDue to its fast paced, skirmish then break skirmish then break story structure, I originally thought that character development was lacking in Hellsing. But Hirano uses the battle structure as a way of showing you what type of character the person is. There are many many speeches in these battles that explain their ideals, motives, etc. It isn't really done as subtley as some similiarly natured manga, but still gets the job done. Most of the characters pass away fast, and so only a few get gradually built up. These brief characters are actually quite interesting and original, which makes it easier to appreciate them as much as the built up characters before they die abruptly. The majority of the characters in the series have interesting abilities and larger than life motives for pursuiting battle. If I had to say what the series major weakness was, its most likely the fact that the brief characters aren't given more page time and lack development, which can't be made up just because most of them are interesting and original.\nI recommend that you read this series as it is meant to be read, periodically. Read one volume, and then wait a couple days or even a week to read the next. There are many cliffhangers and plot developments that serve to enhance the enjoyment level greatly. I did this and was excited and involved until the end. The action is the bread and butter of this series, and the characters were all very cool, with only a few being \"very developed\". If you are wanting a break from your deeply thought provoking, hipster manga, than pick up a copy of Hellsing and your adrenaline will thank you.\n\n\n\"Let us drive away those who have forgotten us, let us pull awake those who have fallen in their sleep. Let us pull them up by their hair and pry their eyes open and make them remember. Let us remind them of the taste of fear. Let us remind them of the sound of our military shoes pounding. Let us remind them that there are things between the earth and the sky which they would not even dream to be possible.\nWe will burn the world down.\nHere we go, gentlemen.\"\n- The Major"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="          \n    Well before I start I'd like to get one thing straight. I never liked vampires and I thought everyone who watched twilight and those other vampire show/ movies were simply out to lunch. Thats why when I was introduced to Hellsing I was a little bit concerned that I wouldn't find it enjoyable. \nBut boy was I wrong, this manga was top notch. The art style was very pleasing, and I enjoyed the really gory scenes which I thought were drawn out really well (although some were confusing at times).\nThe story Is about a vampire named Alucard who is a slave (not against his will)\n          \n        to Integra Hellsing, the leader of the Hellsing organization. If you couldn't guess by the name, the Hellsing organization hunts vampires, and works for the church of England to protect England from supernatural forces. But an old enemy is on the rise looking for revenge, and they are, nazis of course. Now this may sound like \"oh boy the evil guys are nazis and the author is an idiot that doesnt know what hes talking about\" well you are most certainly wrong. These aren't idiot nazis, these are the real deal. They actually have a background story dating back to the world war 2 rat lines. Each one is depicted wearing German world war two uniforms, and using German world war 2 weapons. There is nothing stupid about these nazis, and do not skip this manga for that reason, you will regret it. Now there is another orginization called the Iscariots (which is Judas' last name) who protect the vatican from supernatural forces. Now if you know anything about the church protestants and catholics didn't get along very well during the renaissance. Well lets just say the Iscariots still don't get along with Hellsing, but neither of them get along with nazi's. So what you have is Nazi's out for revenge on Hellsing, and Iscariots out for revenge on both of them. This makes for a very interesting story, and very interesting fight scenes, which I won't discuss as to not ruin the story. \nOverall it was an enjoyable manga, it had a very dark story line with some deep character development. But the best part was how it used historical events and events from Dracula, while still managing to be entirely unique and original. You do not have to be a vampire fan to like this manga, because it is the well written story and character development that makes this manga.\nI conclude that if you like action, European history, Vampires, and a dark story, you should definitely read this. If you dont like blood and gore, or prefer less or no action perhaps you prefer comedies or slice of life, then you should probably stay clear. \nthanks for reading. "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="           \n    Just finished it. Here's my thought. That's right. One thought: \nDAMN. \nThe first five books are build up - and the last five are just nothing but action: non-stop, ridiculous, bloody, violent, glorious fight scenes. Okay, so there are some odd touching moments, times of regret and sadness, confusion, heart-stopping, shattering disbelief... And all through it, blood, blood, blood and teeth.\nAnd some bullets. Some really BIG guns.\nOkay, a few things. The story is top notch. My beef is the art. Which is crazy I know - but that's the thing. It gets so hectic and detailed, that sometimes it's hard to determine what's going on.\n          \n        It gets so crowded with bodies and blood, and buildings and guns, that sometimes what you should be paying attention to, gets lost in all the black ink. Which is a style and does not need to be changed at all - I just had to pause in my reading to figure out who or what was going where.\nCharacters are top notch - a few characters here and there I wished would be fleshed out more, but those were tertiary characters. Not even second. The secondary characters had fantastic development. The first level characters? Alucard and Seras? They managed to keep developing right til the end! Ridiculous! - In a good way.\nEnjoyment? **** yeah. Just insane. A few pages dragged - and I do mean maybe three or four out of the whole series. (Major's LONG speech being it). \nReading it got a little difficult, but I've already touched on that. Will I read it again? Definitely. Will I recommend it. Hell YES. Will I lend it out? Well - I already told my brother I'd lend the last half to him when I was done.\nWill I buy it? Well, let's just say, I bought six volumes in a row after reading one.\nSo - if you like blood, guns, guts, massacres, insanity, a tad creepiness, and mass amounts of deaths... this is it. \nNo, there are no pretty boys. Alucard is dangerous and straight up alluring in his thirst for bloody entertainment.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="             \n    Hellsing was my first manga and actually it was the fact I started reading more of them. \nThere is everything you can expect from an bloody-vampire-action-gore manga like this. After just a quick glance at the front of the book, you know it's going to be good. Alucard is the most badass vampire you can find in the modern literature. I wasn't bored for a single page and, after finishing one volume, I couldn't wait for another volume to come out.\nOverall, if you want some fast action and nice plot, choose Hellsing.\n"},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="          \n    6.5 really leaning into 7. Overall, this is a pretty decent manga series. While it may be shallow and pretty repetitive, there's enough well drawn art and over the top violence to keep the reader or an average manga fan such as myself occupied. The story moves at a pretty breakneck pace and there's not a lot of exposition or backstory given throughout, but small breadcrumbs about the characters are found here and there. I would have to say about 90 percent of the series focuses on some really fun supernatural and over the top, big gun, bloody spewing dismemberment type action and not so\n          \n        much on the story. But the characters themselves are good and at times I was shocked as to how powerful the author actually pushed to make Alucard an almighty vampire who wields the lives of millions. Some of the other characters had some good personality but were pretty stoic and serious, except for Seras, who is a gleeful, needy, and naive character who balanced out the dark tones and bloodshed of the manga. It was really to see her grow into a true vampire throughout the series as well. So Hellsing is a fairly original pretty fun thrill ride that grabs you by the hair and pulls you through a battlefield of giant guns, bullets, flying limbs and squirting blood, while you try to hang on and catch a glimpse of the plot here and there. A good series for manga, anime, and gaming fans who enjoy a bit of the old ultraviolence over plot every now and again. And as a side note, if you want to desensitize yourself to violence; read Hellsing.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="              \n    In one of my earlier reviews I stated that Rurouni Kenshin was the best manga ever, and it is, but over the last months i have found a close second Hellsing. the story could be better and the artwork in the early volumes is a little meh, but Hellsing is the most Badass manga i think i have ever read because of the main character: Alucard. He is not your stereotypical, screwed up past \"Every things my fault\" emo kind of character, and I like that. well let me try to describe the story without spoilers:\nHellsing is about a vampire slaying organization by the name\n          \n        of Hellsing, it was founded by Dr. Van Hellsing at the end of the Bram Stoker Dracula story. they have a Vampire under they're control by the name of Alucard, (who is probobly the only character besides Sephiroth from Final Fantasy VII who looks more intimidating when he's smiling). Alucard is a powerful vampire who swore his life to the Hellsing organization and kills other vampires for them. Hellsing itself is Run by a young woman named Integra Hellsing, Hellsing itself takes orders the prodistant church and takes orders from the Queen of England herself.\nThis is as far i can go without spoilers so i'm going to talk about the art:\nKohta Hirano's style is pretty unique when it comes to Manga/Anime he usually portrays his characters with very long arms and huge hands which at times can be a little unsettling(for lack of a better word) but it grows on you and you begin to like it, another thing that i find funny is that 89% of his characters wear glasses which i did'nt notice until a friend of mine pointed it out (I think glasses look cool). \nWell this review is getting long and i should wrap it up but overall Hellsing is one of the most enjoyable manga i have read in my life since rurouni kenshin\nand thats saying alot. but hellsing does have its flaws its still a kick-ass manga and so is Hellising-Ultimate which is an OVA adaption that is almost complete (but i am still eagerly waiting part 7!!! I CANT WAIT UNTIL DECEMBER) well that is Hellsing and any fan of action manga should check it out.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="            \n        Hellsing was the only vampire story that didn't contain any love story and is filled with a good, blood-spurting time. I definely recommend this series over twilight, Vampire Knight, or Rosario Vampire. \n     The character of the story was filled with what I even began to think was real. The plot was one of the best I had ever read and I am determined to read to the very last book. The comic relief let me be able to still read even when it was leading to a battle filled\n          \n        with murder and blood. \n      The art was especially my favorite part. I have drawn several pictures based on Hellsing and the characters. I think the Hellsing Ultimate series should have continued on, considering how it kept the story as it was.

Hellsing.\nIt's an interesting idea that's executed generally well in this manga. The main character's name is Alucard, and he's basically the strongest vampire in the world. Alucard and co. typically don't fight against Nazis, they mostly fight against other supernatural forces. The Hellsing organization only care about defending London, and they do whatever they need to do so they can keep London safe.There are only 10 volumes and the series doesn't seem too dragged out. It does get extremely gorey at points, but hey it's a war what do you\n          \n        expect.\nHonestly, I read this series quite a while ago so I don't remember many details from the story itself, but I do remember that it does get confusing at times.
