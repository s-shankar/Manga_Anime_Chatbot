However, upon meeting Haruhi Suzumiya, he quickly finds out that it is the supernatural that she is interested in—aliens, time travelers, and espers among other things. When Haruhi laments about the lack of intriguing clubs around school, Kyon inspires Haruhi to form her own club. As a result, the SOS Brigade is formed, a club which specializes in all that is the supernatural. Much to his chagrin, Kyon, along with the silent bookworm, Yuki Nagato, the shy and timid Mikuru Asahina, and the perpetually smiling Itsuki Koizumi, are recruited as members. The story follows the crazy adventures that these four endure under their whimsical leader, Haruhi. The story is based on the light novels by Nagaru Tanigawa. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1044, ["text"]="\n                          \n    Warning: This review contains some SPOILERS\nI&#039;ve read many reviews of this show, and they&#039;re varied - some people love it, some hate it. Personally, I love this show, and am almost surprised that some people don&#039;t. But then again, if you don&#039;t like the sheer randomness and wackiness that the show builds on, the anime won&#039;t appeal to you.\nThe setting is as following &ndash; a girl (Haruhi Suzumiya) has the power to change reality &ndash; a sort of God, in other words. She is unaware of this ability herself.  Her wish of meeting espers, aliens and time travelers, combined with the aforementioned power, ends\n          \n        up in her making a club where said types of beings come together (she&rsquo;s unaware of them being any more than normal humans, though) &ndash; along with a perfectly normal guy named Kyon; the first normal human to get along with her. Her club is called the SOS Brigade (Save the world by Overloading it with fun Suzumiya Haruhi&rsquo;s Bridage), and we follow them as they partake in various &ndash; and humorous &ndash; activities.\n\nStory-wise, you can say the anime is episodic in that there&#039;s a new event every episode, but there&#039;s still ties between the individual episodes, which makes a true chronological order present. However, they were originally aired in a non-chronologic order, to make things even more confusing and random. Personally, I prefer the chronological order over the broadcast order, but I&#039;ve heard people say otherwise. I&#039;ll try to list ups and down as good as possible:\nBroadcast order:\n+ You&#039;ll get some good character development\n+ The end of the series actually come at the end\n- References to episodes that you haven&#039;t watched yet\n- First episode might scare you off (watch it till the end!)\nChronological order:\n+ Linear story\n- The ending is kinda in the middle of the series\n- Character development may feel a bit reset after episodes\nDecide for yourself =)\nTo me, the story was really great, and so was the setting. Each episode contained so much - you may feel that you&#039;ve watched more than one episode&#039;s length at the end of an episode. This is partially due to the pacing - it varies from the slow, standard slice-of-life pacing to hyperactive and fast pacing which fits with Haruhi&#039;s character.\n\nThe animation style of the show is excellent. Kyoto Animation definitely lives up to their reputation - most of the series they&#039;ve worked on has an excellent animation quality (note: excellent, not necessarily perfect). The characters move so fluidly, the coloring is great, and other details are good too. Haruhi&#039;s various hair styles are a plus too. Lighting effects are good too..Their faces lost detail too often, which drags it down.\n\nThe soundtrack is so-so. It&#039;s not the best, but it&#039;s good nevertheless. The OP/ED themes are catchy and good stand-alone songs, and the BGM is decent for this type of show. Voice acting is really good too; they manage to portray Haruhi&#039;s hyperactiveness and Kyon&#039;s laid-back, sarcastic character very well.\n\nWhen it comes to the characters, many people drag the score down because of the near-absence of character development. But, hey, guess what folks? It&#039;s a 14-episode slice of life/comedy anime. You don&#039;t watch these if you want character development. Sometimes you&#039;ve got to think about what you&#039;re rating before you rate it. I don&#039;t let low amounts of character development drag down the score for this kind of anime. Though, watching it in broadcast order presents you with some good character development towards the end.\nOkay, the characters may be a little unoriginal - the laid-back guy and the hyperactive girl pair is definitely not something unseen. A quiet and shy girl and a moe/loli girl aren&#039;t unusual either. But what made the characters in TMoHS as good as they were was the unique way in which they were presented - it kinda made me forget that they&#039;re based on character types seen many times before in the world of anime.\nThe story is told from Kyon&#039;s point of view, and he tells the story in a style that just made me burst out in laughter from time to time. Haruhi&#039;s hyperactiveness and, as Nagato said, 'absence of universally accepted personality traits', makes her really fun to watch, and she gives me a good laugh more than once per episode. What people may find repulsive about her behavior is her constant sexual harassments of poor Mikuru. But I&#039;ve seen people who hate the show based on only that, which I find stupid. Anyway, you&#039;ve got to be prepared for a little fanservice from Haruhi&#039;s and Mikuru&#039;s interactions, if that&#039;s the correct term.\n\nAll in all, TMoHS is a series which, to me, lived up to most of the hype. Good way of telling a 14-episode story, good animation, decent soundtrack, characters who were portrayed in a way that made them original, and of course, a unique setting. And not to mention, it&#039;s highly rewatchable, both for getting to watch it in both orders and because it&#039;s just pure fun to watch over and over again.\nTo &#039;Not Helpful&#039; voters (and you &#039;Helpful&#039; voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=861,  ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    It's not easy writing a review for such a well known and extremely successful anime. I'll do my best though. \nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is, I feel I can safely say, a milestone in Anime history. Much like Evangelion, Suzumiya brings new light and brilliance to something we didn't know could exist. It brings pure genius comedy and an excellent array of characters to keep you hooked.\nWhat's so good about it you ask? Why's this anime good enough to be deemed a milestone. It's simple. Haruhiism. It's a religion named after Haruhi herself. Her character posses such a strong charisma that you can't help\n          \n        but feel attracted and entertained by her. Her comments throughout the show are comparable with no other characters in any series that I can think of. Kyon along side her completes the two so incredibly well that its near impossible to not want to watch the next episode to see how the two will interact.\nEnough rambling, the story is awesome. It's presented to you out of chronological order. That means episode 4 comes after episode 6, and episode 8 comes before 5 (not the actual order of the show). Don't worry though, the episodes are out of order with purpose and intention, and it makes the anime all the more interesting.\nThe Animation is top notch. There's one episode where a particular character is singing and they have the lyrics/drummer/guitarist sinked perfectly. Beautiful fight scenes (though these are short and infrequent) too.\nThe sound/music is pretty decent, with the opening and ending pretty catchy. Nothing amazing though.\nI only gave the characters a 9/10 because there isn't enough information given about everyone to really get to know the character. Sure each definitely has their own personality, but we don't \"know\" them by the time the show ends.\n10/10 for enjoyment, without a doubt.\nIf you haven't picked this series up, do it now. It's one of those \"must sees\" and you will not regret it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=747,  ["text"]="                          \n    2 things before you read this review:\n1) I (unfortunately) watched the series twice, both in airing and chronological order, so I can compare them.\n2) This is not a praise Haruhi review, but rather a review from someone who truly dislikes and despises the show. I tried to include all reasons behind this; so even if you are a Haruhi fanatic, please try to understand why I rated it so low.\nNow onto the review.\nMAL is the place where I usually decide the new anime series I want to watch. Unfortunately, this sometimes proves to be disastrous - like the case of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.\n          \n        Reading the synopsis, seeing the nice graphics and all the hype around it, I really expected something great, intelligent and unusual. Instead, I got a really big disappointment - manifested by a boredom and annoyance overdose.\nFrom what I've seen, there are usually two approaches of the show that Haruhi fans support. First is the parody one - TMoHS is supposed to be a light comedy not meant to be taken seriously, destined purely for laughter. Second states that TMoHS is a deep, subtle and intelligent show that has a lot of hidden meanings. I honestly disagree with both. TMoHS is nothing more than a series that delivers to fans what fans want - exaggerated, cliche characters, lots of fanservice, predictability and little to none plot and character development.  \nStory\nYou can't talk about the story without mentioning the really unusual way in which the episodes are aired - and that is, not chronological. I admit, this is an extremely intelligent, even brilliant idea - to hide the fact that the plot of TMoHS is basically zero. Nopes. Nothing ever happens; it's just a bunch of high school and spare time events that some teenagers go through randomly thrown in. That's why, it really doesn't matter in which order you watch the show, since you won't miss anything. \nNow, the whole 'God is amongst us' concept could have been really interestingly developed - if it wasn't for the characters.\nCharacters\nIn my opinion, characters truly represent the poorest aspect of the show. Leaving aside the fact that there is no development in their personalities at all, they are so poorly made, that it's almost as if they were created to be mocked at. In an elegant way, you could say that they are one-dimensional sketches or exaggerated caricatures. In a non sophisticated, yet same true way, you could just call them crappy. Either way, they cut off all the enjoyment the story could have brought. Because they are so simplistic, the viewer is basically able to predict anything that's about to happen in the following 5 minutes with an accuracy of 95% - unless he's an idiot. \nSo let's move onto each one of them.\nHaruhi:\nHaruhi is what every teenage girl would want to be - she's beautiful, she's smart, she's talented and athletic. She could be called either a Mary Sue character or a tsundere - I don't care. Because of all her qualities, her life was probably pretty easy, thus leading her to believe she's special. However, she doesn't want to be special only for herself - she wants the world to know how great of a person she is. So far, so good. Then why is she so unlikeable? Well, Haruhi's way of proving she's something else is definitely WRONG. \nIf there was one adjective I had to pick to describe Haruhi, then I'd probably choose aggressive. Haruhi is aggressive in everything. Her speech is aggressive, her ideas are aggressive, her way of waving her hands is aggressive, but most important of all - her relationships towards other people is aggressive. She has no value of human morals whatsoever, considering everybody her pawns. Therefore, Haruhi thinks she is allowed to do everything just because she's able to. I honestly waited throughout the whole series for someone to slap her, disagree with her or at least spark the tiniest bit sense of reality into her. Unfortunately, there was no positive development at all. Haruhi started out as a perfect, bossy bitch and ended up as an even more bitchy one, receiving several ego boosts as the series advanced due to her talented, almighty nature. \nYuki:\nYuki could as very well be replaced by a broken alarm clock that rings when it shouldn't or by an old, rusted door and there would hardly be any differences. 90% of Yuki's actions are static - she's just, well, there, reading a book. (The climax of Yuki's passiveness is reached during episode 14, when the viewer is shown 5 minutes in which basically all she does is change the page while voices full of references echo on the school corridor. That's 5 freaking minutes of NOTHING. Yet I, as a viewer, should find this utterly amusing.) The rest 10% of Yuki's actions make absolutely no sense. She's just programming computers or fighting cute aliens while being equally cute, silent and moe.   \nMikuru:\nMikuru's only purpose in this show is to bring fanservice. Lots and lots, if possible. Mikuru has this high-pitched, squeaky scream and this shy personality which enables her to make all fanboys fall for her. She's like a sickening cute, fluffy hamster that starts squealing every time she's touched (and she sure gets touched a lot, mind you.) Every once in a while, she might give you the unpleasant surprise that she's not actually a commercial item and she can exit her tormented animal state too and be human - by speaking. \nKoizumi:\nI haven't read the original novels so I can't tell for sure what role Koizumi plays in them - but to me, it seems as the creator of TMoHS had, at some point, reached a pinch. He had to create a new character. Therefore, his line of reasoning was probably something like this: \"Hey, I already have 3 extremely moe and likable female characters. I should make a guy too, so the female audience would be pleased. Yeah, yeah, I should make a guy - as elegant and charming as possible.\" Thus Koizumi was born.\nBasically, unless you're a crazy fangirl or something similar, you'd barely be able to notice Koizumi - I, for once, kept forgetting his name all the time. To be honest, the only time I acknowledged his existence was when he kept staring at Kyon's hair in the middle of a mole fluttering in the ocean breeze. I thought it was the most irrelevant and repulsing thing TMoHS had brought so far.\nKoizumi serves as the voice through which the strange events occurring around Haruhi are explained. Translation: his speeches are long, boring and put you to sleep. When he talks, he talks. When he doesn't talk, he still talks. \nKyon:\nKyon is a sword with two edges. On one hand, he's really sarcastic, being quite innovative to the ordinary guy genre - thus proving to be the only aspect that might seem slightly interesting during the series. On the other one, he's extremely unlikable due to the fact that he doesn't take any action at all - unless forced by Haruhi. Kyon was the viewer's last hope of Haruhi redemption - yet he fails miserably, by making her even worse than how she actually started off. \nArt and Sound\nArt and sound are probably the only positive aspects of the show. TMoHS manages to create a pretty good atmosphere - the movements are flowing easily, the colors are bright and clean, the background music fits in - even though it doesn't stand out as more than ordinary. The OP and ED are either really addictive or annoying to the core - I'm more inclined to the latter. Voices are OK, the actors managing to catch each character's personality - which only adds up to how you, as a viewer, perceive them. Overall, no major problem.\nEnjoyment\nZero. Zero enjoyment. I can't quite comprehend how a normal, rational person can watch a show where the characters are horrible and the story is predictable - and, at the same time, enjoy it. Haruhi is a mediocre anime for the masses. It was meant to be liked by all those who want to stand out but have no means of doing so. I honestly expect much more from my anime when I watch it. I want to be hooked or at least slightly entertained. Leave aside the fact that I constantly kept staring elsewhere asking myself 'when will this crap be over?'; I couldn't even grin ONCE throughout the series. That's how uninteresting it was.\nOverall\nWhen rating, I usually consider two aspects. One is enjoyment; the other is the effort that I feel the creators put into the certain anime. Animation-wise, KyoAni really overdid itself. Plot-wise, it was a total wreck. \nTherefore, I really cannot rate TMoHS more than 4 out of 10.\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=235,  ["text"]="                          \n    Haruhi plays off of everybody\'s favorite comedic cliche, where a straight-shooting, somewhat-dull, and mostly-normal lead character is paired up with an energetic free spirit thanks to a convenient set of circumstances. These personalities play off of each other, resulting in wild adventures with both disastrous and hilarious consequences. Are there wild adventures? Yes. Are the results sometimes disastrous and/or hilarious? Yes. Is this an excellent series that is well worth your time? No. Haruhi is nothing more than a mediocre series with illusions of grandeur.\nMany of the show\'s aspects, such as the supernatural characters and the irregular airing order (oh how avant garde!), may appear\n          \n        groundbreaking on the surface, but there is nothing especially extraordinary about Haruhi as a whole. Despite their strange origins, most of the cast is comprised of tired, one-dimensional caricatures; Haruhi is certainly not the first anime to feature a well-endowed ditz, a withdrawn bookworm, and a domineering foil to a reserved protagonist. The situations that these characters are placed in are somewhat unique, but their behavior during each episode is painfully predictable. The story wraps up nicely and some depth is added to each character when all is said and done, but the whole ride through is rather bland and at times downright boring.\nHaruhi is not terrible. The plot is decent through and through. It is not, however, an artistic breakthrough in the genre of anime (as some would have you believe). It is for that reason that I give it a harsh \'4\' rating.\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=140,  ["text"]="                          \n    CAUTION: Review contains spoilers of both seasons of Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi. Read at your own risk.\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya really only falls flat on the character that bitches her way to success and continuously cleans her superiority complexion. Allow me to elaborate.\nI mean, normally those kinds of characters are just a means for comedy and we just see them scoffed off for fun. But, actually seeing one have their way was a bit strange and made the anime feel awkward since she was literally a god and had to be pleased or else she could destroy the world she lived in; unintentionally that\n          \n        is.\nJust Haruhi alone is almost worse than the Endless Eight was; only because she started out good and then progressively became worse. It had a fun story, sure, but the story felt a bit plain in the long run; no thanks to the aforesaid arc and Haruhi. For what it is worth, I do remember it having pretty good visuals.\nActually, you know what, once you see an arc where the episodes begin to repeat themselves, just skip to the end of it. There are eight episodes in it and the eighth episode resolves the whole ordeal. Besides that, the rest are vital spoilers; but feel free to skip this arc when you come across it.\nBut if you are a fan of character development, this anime falls flat after the beginning. Mikuru gets tortured constantly, up to the point where she inadvertently drank a spiked beverage and was told to kiss Itsuki just so that Haruhi would be satisfied with her film; makes sense to have a love scene and all, but she was drunk and had no say in the matter.\nOh, and she probably had the most grief caused throughout that whole movie arc than anyone else, up to the point where Kyon almost punched Haruhi in the face to knock some sense into her until damn Itsuki had to stop him; she was about to finally have some justice served to her. At one point, Haruhi gives Kyon an arbitrary task just so that she could be alone with Mikuru for more torture.  In the long run, character development just suffered thanks to Haruhi.\nWell, except for Kyon and Mikuru that is. And I admired how the way Kyon was thinking in the anime is a reminder that even the nicest guys can still be perverts, but that does not mean they are bad people on the inside; simply means they are normal and healthy as they have urges like all men do. It sure stays true to a quote that Family Matters brought up once: \"If you think it, that is just your imagination. If you do it, then you will suffer dearly\" which can be applied to lots of things, such as this.\nIf I have to be completely honest, though. Well, actually I was being honest. It was thanks to how arrogant Haruhi was that the anime fell flat. After sharing her tale to Kyon about the vastness of the world and how it changed the way she viewed things, I imagined that she would have simply been rude on the outside, but showed a soft side to him whenever they were alone; which I believe was a recurring instance during the first season. But, after the next season, Haruhi became an indefinite tsundere and it ruined the nice nature of the previous season.\nThough if you enjoy characters that torture other characters and do not mind that the bitchy character finally has her way, then this anime might be alright. But, in all fairness, outside Haruhi, the story is alright and pretty imaginative. But, nothing out of the ordinary that I would call incredible and unforgettable; besides how Haruhi got away with how mean she was to people. But, in all honesty, when she is not being rude, she is actually one of the more attractive anime characters that I have seen; I give them points on giving her a design that stands out from other female leads.\nShould you watch it? Only if you are in a hiatus and have been unable to find anymore good anime in the past while.

We have this so called god that gathers together an alien, time traveler, esper, and a \"normal human\"  to form a club. But this \"god\" doesn't know that she has gathered all these strange people. And ironically enough, the purpose of the club is to find aliens, time travelers, and espers and have fun with them. The purpose of the club members is to keep this god entertained so that she won't destroy the world. What I like about this concept is that not only is it unique, it allow many possibilities in how the story is told. The author\n          \n        makes full use of everyones special abilities.\nAnimation: All credit goes to Kyoto Animation for really using this concept to its potential. What so great about the animation is all the detail it has. Each story is uniquely portrayed and really shows what the author had intended. KyoAni also cleverly implanted all these subtle actions that reflects the actions in other episodes so when you rewatch this you will be like \"oh I see why she had this reaction\" in case you missed it the first time.\nSound: Two words: Hirano Aya. She sings the opening, ending, the two insert song, and is the heroine in the anime. Each song is very catchy and fun to listen to. You wouldn't believe all these songs were sang by the same person, but Hirano Aya has a huge vocal range. Voice acting is also really well done. Each voice really fits their character.\nCharacter: Probably the best thing about this show the very unique cast of characters. It is really very rare for me to be able to like all the characters (even Itsuki). Each character appeals to you in its own way. But the biggest factor is the subtle change and growth of the characters. I had a great time evaluating the characters at the beginning of the series with them at the end. KyoAni really know how to do their stuff.\nReplay Value: Moderately High. With such details, you would need to watch it over to catch all the details. Furthermore, the way KyoAni set up the episode order, at least one more watch is in order.\nOverall: This was a great experience. It rare these days for a show to really overwhelm you. I have never enjoyed an anime this much and I look forward to the second season.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=136,  ["text"]="                          \n    As far as anime go, this is one of the most overhyped titles that I've ever seen. I've never been someone that has followed any hypes or paid my attention to them, but the hype around Haruhi was so excessive that I just had to find out what it was, and to be honest, for the life of me, I couldn't discover the reason for the hype.\nA couple of people that I call friends recommended this anime to me telling me how great the story is and how fantastic the characters are. When I watched Haruhi the first episode was a real shocker, it was\n          \n        so bad that I immediately wanted to turn it off and throw the DVD away and watch something else, but not wanting to disappoint them I kept on watching, so I put the first episode in fast forward, although that didn't really change the fact that it looked terrible and was maybe written by a 3 year old.\nBut anyway, enough ragging on the introduction, let's take a look at the scores.\nStory: 3\nThe story of Haruhi is shown in a non-chronological order, it consists of 6 story episodes randomly thrown between 8 filler episodes. Those 8 filler episodes don't actually matter to the overall anime and show no character development or help the story advance in any way. In chronological order those 8 episodes happen after the 6 story episodes and the only reason I can see for their inclusion in the anime is to stretch the length of the anime, since the 6 story episodes can easily be fit into the time frame of a single movie.\nThe 6 story episodes show a decent although more or less generic story. It has it's moments and I can certainly enjoy those 6 episodes, however the inclusion of the meaningless filler episodes and the terrible opening episode (the one where they are making that movie) detract from the story and make the viewing a much less pleasurable thing for me.\nAll of this leads me to conclude that the anime has a rather poor story, since 8 of the 14 episodes don't have any meaning to the anime and what remains is an atleast competent athough generic story. So, a score of 3 on the story part.\nArt: 8\nThe art is of a high standard and the anime certainly looks good, however the visual design of a lot of things in the anime (like the characters) is rather generic and I feel that the makers could have done a lot more then what is shown.\nSound: 7\nThe sound is well executed and the songs are nice. In terms of sound effects they could have done a lot more, since they could also have done more with the visuals (they usually match).\nCharacters: 2\nThe character design in the anime is rather pathetic. They used basic character templates that are as overused as can be. Heck, they use character templates that actually seem to be imported from a generic \"H-Game turned Anime\" like say Green Green or Fate/stay Night.\nThose basic templates are: Spineless Male Main character (Kyon), Easy Achievement Girl (A girl in a H-Game that you can't go wrong with and has the most direct part to the H scenes, obviously I mean Haruhi with this), Emotionally Distant, intellectual girl with glasses (Yuki), Bigbreasted airhead (Mikuru), the little sister (Kyon's sister obviously) and the possibly gay supporting male character and main character's best friend (Itsuki).\nBesides the generic overused character templates the anime shows little character development, with which I mean that the character development is limited to less then half the episodes in the anime. In the story episodes there is a good amount of character development, I would even go as far as saying that those 6 episodes have too much of it, and story. I feel that they rushed those 6 episodes and jammed too much into it.\nWith all of this I can only say that they produced rather dreadful characters, badly designed and straight from an H-Game with rather inconsistent amounts of character development. A dreadful score here.\nEnjoyment: 3\nAn anime consisting for more then half of the episodes out of filler (heck, even Naruto and Dragonball Z had a smaller percentage of filler), with generic characters, the most horrible opening episode ever seen in an anime and basically everything I mentioned above this, you can guess that I certainly didn't enjoy it very much. A 3 is all it can get.\nOverall: 5\nAll of this amounts to a rather mediocre anime in my opinion. If they removed those 8 filler episodes and worked out the story a bit more it would have been a much better anime, even with the substandard character design.\nAfter this huge rant I still cannot imagine the reason behind the hype surrounding this anime. But then again, something as generic and stretched beyond comprehension as Dragonball Z also still has a huge following.\nI guess this will be one mystery that I won't be able to solve...\nIf you didn't think my review was helpful, please leave a message on my profile and explain why you thought my review wasn't helpful. That way I can improve my reviews to make them better in the future.\nThank you in advance.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=134,  ["text"]="                          \n    Great, I've come to the most overrated anime that ever existed. \nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a good show. It is by no means great. And it certainly isn't one of the best anime ever created, I don't even KNOW how it managed to grab that title a while back. \nThe story IS unique, I will give it that.

The sound is...bleh. I didn't notice it. I liked the ED though, but who doesn't like the ending or the stupid dance??\nThe characters were good. They were like spins on stereotypes. Kyon is the 'boring unexceptional brown-haired guy', Mikuru is the walking pile of moe, Yuki is the aloof meganekko, that other guy whose name escapes me is the sort of 'Whee~ Happy Everyday!' sort of guy, and then there's Haruhi. She's so original that I cannot even place her in a set category. I do know she's a self-centred bitchy girl though.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=117,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    Let me say that The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is one of the best and most popular series of 2006. It's a strange, eccentric, funny, and sometimes touching show that seems to be a mix of comedy, sci-fi, mystery, and a fourth genre that doesn't seem to fit into any previously existing categories. Perhaps we should call it Haruhism? Though I guess you could say it's main focus is comedy, the randomness of the story proves that it exceeds at various other genres as well. It is deeply philosophical and yet silly in concept, with story telling that reeks of slice-of-life and yet doesn't quite\n          \n        fit into that mold. In fact, it's difficult to fit Haruhi Suzumiya into any mold at all since while it seems to fulfill the attributes required for a comedy or sci-fi/mystery series, it doesn't really fit any of those. Rather it is something else entirely. Perhaps this is the reason why the show can be so enjoyable and yet so incomprehensible at the same time.\nStory: It&rsquo;s difficult to discuss the plot in Haruhi Suzumiya since the way the plot is presented and the story told differs depending on which version is being watched. In the original television airing, the episodes were presented out of order, and hence it developed its own unique form of plot development in which the pieces of the &ldquo;main storyline&rdquo; were scattered across the 14 total episodes in a non-linear fashion. Therefore, it became kind of a puzzle for the viewer to take those pieces and reconstruct them into a coherent whole. As the series was released on DVD, the original episode order was used as opposed to the original broadcast order. As a result, the story is more coherent, as the &ldquo;main storyline&rdquo; was presented in a linear and more or less comprehensible manner. And yet, the plot is still quite difficult to follow, especially if you&rsquo;re not one to pay close attention to small details. Basically, the story revolves around an eccentric high school freshman named Haruhi Suzumiya and her club, the SOS brigade. Most of the story occurs with the consistent background narratives of Kyon, Haruhi&rsquo;s lazy and cynical classmate who happens to be the only one who manages to engage her in meaningful conversation. Unwillingly dragged along for the ride, the story is actually told from Kyon&rsquo;s perspective as his narratives often show his view of the situation as well as showing his personal insight into the story and the characters.\nCharacters: Haruhi&rsquo;s other recruits include Mikuru Asahina, a pretty, well-endowed sophomore who also happens to be a time traveler from the future, Itsuki Koizumi, a male transfer student who is an esper that possess supernatural abilities, and Yuki Nagato, an organic life contact-purpose humanoid interface created by an alien existence called the Data Integration Thought Entity. Of course, none of this is known to Haruhi as the reason why the three of these extraordinary characters are gathered in one place was because Haruhi herself isn&rsquo;t exactly human, and her influence in the world around her was greater than she could ever imagine. Without spoiling anything, it&rsquo;s safe to say that there is more to Haruhi than meets the eye. If you&rsquo;re already lost or confused, don&rsquo;t worry, as it would seem that confusion and incredulity was exactly the intention. In fact, we&rsquo;re almost expected to view these incredible events, and like Kyon, be completely bewildered by, and yet completely accepting of them. This is one of the many eccentricities of Haruhi that are almost impossible to explain with words. Of course, I should probably mention the various comedic situations, including some very moe ones involving our favorite cosplayer Mikuru-chan, the short-lived but exciting sci-fi action sequences, and finally the few genuinely touching scenes involving our drama queen Haruhi and her trusty companion Kyon. There is even a pair of episodes that play out like a classic western murder mystery. Haruhi Suzumiya is truly a mish-mash of genres: pop-culture-inspired, sci-fi otaku, mystery-romantic comedy . . . but without the romance.\nArt &amp; Animation: It also helps that the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a very impressive visual experience. Produced by the now highly-acclaimed Kyoto Animation, who is known for other works such as Air and Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid, the animation is bright and colorful, smooth and crisp. The use of CGI in a few places is a little questionable but well-conceived and not overdone. Though the action sequences aren&rsquo;t entirely commonplace and often short-lived they are beautifully directed and animated with impressive fluidity and fidelity. Then of course there&rsquo;s the mind-blowing Haruhi dance, the little number that Haruhi and her four SOS Brigade club members engage in during the ending sequence. \nSound: The voice acting is superb, with Kyon&rsquo;s voice being especially suited for his character. Newcomer Aya Hirano also proves her talent through her expressive voicing of Haruhi, which by all means is a difficult character to voice. The English dub is also top-notch with big names like Wendee Lee (voicing Haruhi) and Crispin Freeman (voicing Kyon). Johnny Bosch also does a great job voicing Koizumi. While not quite at the level of a de-facto standard like Cowboy Bebop, the English voice cast is better than most and given the difficulty of the material, they do a splendid job. As such, a second viewing with the dub is definitely recommended since it also has the secondary effect of making the show a little easier to understand. The music, while mostly forgettable compared to the rest of the show, is nevertheless well done, especially the opening and ending themes sung by Aya Hirano.\nEnjoyment: At this point, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to gather that I wasn&rsquo;t really all that impressed with any of the specific elements of the show in particular. The puns can be funny sure, but some work really well, and some just fall flat. Even Mikuru&rsquo;s moe moments, which seem to be a no-brainer success, don&rsquo;t always work out particularly well&mdash;if anything, she&rsquo;s trying a little too hard. The storyline is confusing, and even when watching it in the proper order, one still isn&rsquo;t sure what exactly is happening. The techno jargon in particular may get a little annoying for those who aren&rsquo;t too into the sci-fi aspect of the show. And while we get a fair amount of character development for Kyon and Haruhi, the remaining characters seem a little flat. Moreover, while the mixing of the episodes created a different storytelling experience, it added little to the show other than increased confusion. But alas, the above are just minor kinks when compared to the main problem with the show: it just didn&rsquo;t resonate with me even though I had wholeheartedly wanted it to. Yes, I laughed at the jokes, yes I chuckled at and felt sorry for Mikuru&rsquo;s misfortunes, and yes I enjoyed Haruhi&rsquo;s capricious obsessions. Yet, as hard as I wanted it to, the show just didn&rsquo;t draw me into it nearly as well as it could have. If there is any gaping problem with Haruhi, that problem is a lack of charm. If those were fixed/added, this series would have gotten a ten from me.\nOverall: Nevertheless, Haruhi is one of those shows in which the whole is definitely not equal to the sum of its parts. Overall, the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an impressive accomplishment. It&rsquo;s entertaining, fun, and sometimes thought-provoking. Not often do we see a show that so obviously caters to the fans and yet still manages to provide an interesting, albeit overly complex storyline. And while it&rsquo;s missing a certain endearing quality, it certainly has its moments of brilliance&mdash;definitely not a show to be missed. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=104,  ["text"]="                          \n    The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an anime that needs no introduction. If you’re the least bit familiar with the anime medium, chances are you’ve heard of this series. Though it may be a bit late to write a review for this anime, I’ve yet to see someone who shares my stance on it and has expressed it in a comprehensive and coherent manner, so I thought I’d throw in my own two cents. This review may contain some minor spoilers, though I have tried to keep them to a minimum.\nThis is a controversial series to say the least. Just from a cursory glance at\n          \n        the reviews, one can see that the community is rather divided on this one; there are those who think it’s the best thing since sliced bread, and those who think it’s somewhere between okay and the worst anime ever made. Though I don’t think it’s perfect, I did thoroughly enjoy this anime, but probably not for exactly the same reasons as the former group.\nWhen I was first going into this series last year—​slowpoke, I know—​judging from what I had heard, I was expecting a generic high school slice of life anime with some comedy and moe elements and maybe some fan service (primarily the reason why I had been putting it off for so long). What I got instead was a clever, quirky, self-aware mystery-parody fusion with some light sci-fi elements weaved in and one of the most relatable protagonists ever.\nThe series follows Kyon, a high school freshman who discarded his belief in the supernatural long ago. That is, until he meets an eccentric girl in his class named Haruhi Suzumiya, who’s all about the supernatural. She drags him into creating the SOS Brigade with her, a club which is dedicated to everything supernatural. Soon they recruit Yuki Nagato, Mikuru Asahina, and Itsuki Koizumi into the club. Unbeknownst to Haruhi, these new members are actually an android from an alien world, a time traveler, and an esper, respectively, all sent for different reasons to observe Haruhi, who herself unwittingly possesses god-like powers which allow these supernatural beings to exist by her will alone. The other members must keep Haruhi’s powers in check by preventing her from getting bored, while at the same time making sure she doesn’t find out about their little secret because the ensuing consequences would be unpredictable but almost definitely catastrophic. This creates an unusual and interesting atmosphere of fun and peaceful slice of life mixed with impending doom.\nThe first thing that surprised me about this series was how plot-heavy it was. The main arc takes up 6 of the 14 episodes, and is an adaptation of the first volume of the novels titled The Meloncholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. To my knowledge as someone who has not yet read the novels, the other episodes are adapted from scattered chapters in the later volumes of the novels, and though more of the main storyline could not be adapted due to time constraints, I feel each episode still adds to the experience in its own way. There’s a mostly serious but self-contained murder-mystery arc that consists of two episodes (Remote Island Syndrome Part One and Two), and other episodes serve to develop or provide more insight on the characters (The Day of Sagittarius, Live Alive) while some are just plain funny (The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina Episode 00). All things considered, I don’t think there was a single episode wasted.\nThe characters are probably the most divisive part of the show. Kyon is the cynical, level-headed protagonist and narrator of the series. His narration keeps the show moving along at a brisk pace, and his inner monologues provide more insight on the other characters and his true feelings for them. He’s the voice of reason in the cast, and is constantly questioning the other characters’ actions and the often shaky logic behind them—​and sometimes the show itself. For the non-critical types out there, this may make him come off as whiny, but for viewers like me whose minds are never at rest when watching, he becomes one of the most relatable characters in anime—​or any fiction for that matter—​as his inner thoughts mirrored my own when watching so closely it was almost scary at times (plus, it’s not exactly whining if it’s all in his head, is it?). It feels like Kyon is somewhat of a self-insert of the author, and his observations are based on things that the author has observed in other media and his own while writing it, and he wanted to make a character that called attention to these things for once in an attempt to reach out to like-minded viewers. Kyon is far from perfect, but that’s part of what makes him so relatable for me. He’s knowledgeable but not beyond his years, he’s grounded in his morals but mostly only when others are watching, he’s observant but still oblivious when it comes to such things as a certain someone’s feelings towards him (and the fact that he himself might be more than just a regular high school student).\nBut enough about Kyon. How do the other characters hold up? The titular character, Haruhi Suzumiya, is the self-proclaimed leader of the SOS Brigade and the cause behind most of the conflicts in the series. Her eccentricity and constant energy make her very unpredictable. Some would call her annoying, but I think that’s a rather shallow way of looking at it. For me, she was a very unique character whose unpredictability kept me interested and constantly guessing what she was going to do next. Though she is admittedly self-centered, she also has a compassionate side which comes through in certain key scenes throughout the series. The way she and Kyon played off each other's personalities was also very entertaining.\nThe other characters are somewhat generic and archetypical, but this can be forgiven because the author is fully aware of this and provides a very good reason for why this is so. Haruhi wants her life to be filled with characters similar to those present in the fiction she enjoys (possibly anime and manga), hence why the rest of the main cast is made up of archetypes that can be seen in other series. On top of this, each character has their own reason for being the way they are, and their outward actions may not necessarily reflect how they feel on the inside. This seems like the author’s way of criticizing other anime and manga for using these archetypes without giving a proper justification for why the characters act the way they do, when in fact it is very different from the way people normally act in real life.\nThat said, the characters’ back-stories and motivations are, for the most part, not really expanded upon or explored more deeply after they are initially mentioned. Some are never explicitly stated and left completely up to subtext. This is likely something that was lost in translation from the novels to the anime, but I personally kind of like how it reflects the overall theme of the supernatural elements being in the background and very much hidden under the guise of a regular high school life. It’s also somewhat refreshing to see a show that leaves it up to the viewer to think about its themes instead of doing so for them. Of course, there will be people who don’t think about it at all, but that’s their loss.\nAs expected of Kyoto Animation, the production values are very high for this anime. A lot of attention to detail was put into the animation, which looks smooth and consistent throughout with few hiccups, though the CGI is iffy at times. Truth be told, the art style itself is nothing particularly outstanding, but each character’s individual personalities come through in the character designs, as well as through the way they move.\nThe opening and ending sequences are especially well-done; it’s obvious a lot of time and effort (and money) went into making them. The songs themselves are also quite good, as is the rest of the soundtrack. The background music is varied to fit the many different moods of the series, ranging from the happy and upbeat to the dark and mysterious. Some of the tracks are actually very catchy and memorable. The voice talent is good as well; Sugita Tomokazu’s voice fits Kyon’s character to a tee and makes his inner monologues very pleasant to listen to. The other characters do a fine job of playing their characters’ roles, especially Aya Hirano as Haruhi, who also performed the opening and ending songs, plus some insert songs.\nI have watched this series twice—​the first season that is, I refuse to sit through the Endless Eight more than once—​in both chronological and broadcast order, and I can say that both have their pros and cons. On the one hand, chronological order has a more coherent plot, but most of the plot-centric episodes are clumped together at the beginning, and the last episode is somewhat anti-climactic. On the other hand, broadcast order has the main arc spaced between the other episodes with the climax at the end, but the mixed-up episode order leaves some glaring continuity issues and forces the viewers to put the pieces together themselves. Either way though, there’s not much progress made from one episode to the next once all the characters are introduced, which was one of my biggest gripes with the series. There are some seemingly major plot points that actually have little to no lasting effect on the overall storyline. Granted, it still does more to make progress than your average slice of life, but it seemed like not enough in this case since the show tried to focus more on the plot. Though I suppose that’s another thing that can be chalked up to time constraints, at least in part.\nIf anything, the episodes have a lot of variety. Some would say that the show can’t decide what it wants to be, but I don’t mind at all because it actually does a good job at what it attempts, whether it be comedy, drama, action or mystery. Given the context of the story, it also makes sense for the anime to extend into many different genres, since Haruhi wants her life to resemble the media she consumes, which probably contains quite a bit of variety. This may sound like an excuse for the author to attempt a number of different styles without having to build a new world for each of them, which is likely true, but if so then it's a very clever excuse at that.\nThe series has its own unique brand of humour, which is extremely quirky and often quite subtle in its delivery, and as such, some jokes might go right over some people's heads without them ever realizing that a joke was even there. This is where Haruhi differs from most anime; it isn't afraid to leave some people out on the joke, which allows it to derive humour from places other anime can't. There are plenty of references and in-jokes strewn about, including some brief shout-outs to other anime (Gundam, Full Metal Panic, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time) as well as some lengthier scenes which reference other material. Among these, I particularly appreciated a scene dedicated to parodying Ace Attorney, and an episode that was essentially one extended reference to Legend of the Galactic Heroes. In addition, Kyon's commentary is full of dry wit, and I personally enjoyed it thoroughly, but again it's a type of humour that not everyone can relate to.\nAll in all, this is a show that is certainly a lot more than it appears to be on the surface. Rather than trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator, it runs the risk of having some of its humour and intricacies of its plot lost on some viewers, which is unfortunate for those who are left out, but all the more rewarding for those of us who can appreciate it. It deliberately presents itself as a generic slice of life anime despite being more of an elaborate parody of one, and this is very reflective of the way that Haruhi thinks she lives a regular high school life but is actually living in an intricate construct made to keep her from suspecting otherwise. So I find it funny, if not just a tad bit sad, that so many people have written it off as “just another slice-of-life anime” without looking any deeper into it.\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya demonstrates what can be done within the limits of a slice of life anime in a high school setting, and shows how something can use familiar archetypes and still be unique. It’s certainly not perfect and it does have its flaws, though I have downplayed them here because rather than filling my already long-winded review with complaints that others have already mentioned, I wanted to focus on the reasons why I like this anime which haven’t been explored in other reviews.\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is more than just another slice of life anime. I wish people would give it a chance before writing it off as such.\n        "},

Read on, readers, read on...\nStory: 3\nOk, if you are looking for a deep story driven based anime... do NOT watch this anime. The story is VERY scattered, a lot of the stuff that happens is very confusing and some of it even happens for no reason whatsoever. \nArt/Animation: 9\nThe art style in this anime is actually quite nice, very nice animations, fluid dance animations in the opening and closing themes. A very redeeming quality. The special fx in some of the scenes are also quite nice to\n          \n        look at and not TOO over the top.\nSound: 8\nThe music in this anime is very nice. While I don't really approve of the dances that came with it, Hare Hare Yukai is a guily pleasure at times. A lot of the songs in between, performed by Hirano Aya, really added an extra dimension.\nCharacter: 3\nOk... no. The character development in this series is EXTREMELY poor. Haruhi is a bitch, Yuki is a windbag at times and doesn't seem to show much personality.. is there a reason that so many people choose Yuki as their favorite character? Mikuru is extremely whiny, I've come EXTREMELY close to turning this anime off because of this character. Kyon is, to me, the only character worth watching the anime for. He is very blunt about a lot of issues that I am, and he is just the easiest to bond with as an anime character. \nEnjoyment: 6\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya provided me with laughs, WTFs and screw offs. The humor was one of the very few high points in this anime.\nOverall: 5 \nOverall. TMoHS definitely did NOT live up to the hype preceding it. There needs to be a lot of work done by the time season 2 rolls around. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=100,  ["text"]="                          \n    Story\nSo, what the hell is the plot?! Well, to describe it here would be a huge spoiler, so instead, think of it like this: it's much like the human race trying to keep God entertained with interesting events. It makes you think either stupid or brilliant, you decide because I'm still trying to.\nIs the plot really something original and grand, or is it just a random pebble in a random pond sitting in a random hole in the ground? I can't even begin to understand which. The whole show had me watching, somehow and someway, but I didn't actually like anything I watched until the\n          \n        last episode. It also doesn't help that the episodes are shown out of order to confuse matters, and if there wasn't enough confusion already with data, closed space, and bunny-waitresses! Was the propose of the show to make me ponder in delightful wonder or was it to make me pound my head into my desk until my brain’s oozed out?!\nCharacter(s) & Their Development\nActually, this one is a lot harder to place for this series. The cause of this is because the episodes are out of the order, so that means the development is as well. When you watch, the people you see seem to remain as they are, somehow growing in front of you without the audience even taking notice. It's as if a sneak attack tries to occur while you're sitting there listening to the attackers get in position.\nAnyway, enough comparisons. First off, the characters are weird. You won't find many of them at your school besides a group of Kyons'. Everyone else is meant to be funny, hyper-active, and completely anti-typical. This isn't a bad thing because it fits the shows wacky style; regardless, it takes away any realism that they are attempting to display. Or so I thought…\nThe real secret here is that, by placing the episodes in a jumbled mix, we are treated with getting to know the characters. Thus, making us ready for the supposed ending (aka episode six instead of fourteen). This makes us much more comfortable with the change witnessed. I'm sure you could watch the show in order, but it might appear rushed in some form or manner. The characters do grow, and this is painstakingly apparent once you get use to their mannerisms.\nWhat overall surprised me, but fit just right in the puzzle that is this series, was the bonds the characters make. I didn't really notice how close they all turned out to be until truly thinking about it. The real gold to this though is if the center of it all is Haruhi or Kyon? On first thought, you might think it would indeed be Haruhi because that is the reason everyone is there; however, the one everyone tells everything to is Kyon. So which is the center of this drizzled mess? That's another theory that only really the audience can decide.\nAnimation\nThis was the bombshell for me. Usually, I don't pay much attention to the looks of a show; regardless, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya had such a fluid and lifelike style that it couldn't be denied even with eyes closed. I was truly surprised to find simple movements exaggerated for the viewers pleasure. Not many shows out there could get away with this without being called overly cute, but this one does with flying colors.\nHow odd it seemed in the beginning, but turned into one of it's strongest points. Then again, everything about this show is odd. Very odd. Anyway, it's colorful and has a cheerful display of complex movements in one bundle. If you're all into how good a show looks, then watch Haruhi for that. However, I wouldn't recommend doing that with any show, but whatever you enjoy best.\nMusic\nOnce again, another subject I don't pay much attention to; however, as soon as I can I'm planning on finding the soundtrack to this anime. It is, very bluntly, funky fresh. The opening is poppy, entertaining, and worldly (along with a psychedelic, colorful, banza during the opening theme). The ending has the same feel along with dance moves from your favorite characters to make you listen and watch. Not only that, I was a bit surprised to find interesting music inside the show as well. The battle scenes really shine with their techno twists.\nDubbing/Subbing\nThere was truly nothing special with the subbing in my opinion. The translations, I thought, were pretty nice, and some of my favorite parts of the show have an added oomph. Yet, besides that, the subtitles were… nice. I never really saw anything particular that stood out.\nOverall\nThis was all around interest. Was it enjoyable? I think. Was it bad? I'm not sure. I was left with a lot of questions on how I felt about the show. It's popularity told me to stay clear, but because of that same popularity I opted to watch it anyway. I recall though, in the first episode, I shouted WTF seventeen times in a twenty-three minute timeframe. I assume since the beginning was nothing of what I expected, no plot of any kind introduced, I decided to stick with the rest to see what would become of bunny-girl-waitress-time-traveler-something-or-another.\nThe next few episodes actually bored me. In all reality, only the last two or three episodes got me entertained again. The ride to the end wasn't enjoyable for me, it was a trek I didn't feel up to taking unless it was to force myself. Maybe it's because I couldn't immerse myself into the strange rules this show threw at me. I might have been thinking far too much to actually sit and have fun with what was being shown to me. If that's the case, then my judgment was misplaced. Or maybe I just truly couldn't get into it. Maybe it just didn't interest me as much as others.\nThe plot seemed random, shuffled, and tacky to me. There were times I laughed quite a bit, but mostly it was nothing I could truly sink my teeth into. I can't say I know who to recommend this type of show to. I'm also not really sure why it's so ungodly popular (then again, I'm still asking that question about Neon Genesis Evangelion). So, if you like sci-fi you might like this anime. If you like bunny-girls with big boobs, well, this might be right up your alley, too. This show is a mixture of a lot of unsure things that will either make you scream out, \"WHAT WAS THAT?!\" or \"Master-piece, I loved it!\"\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=95,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    It's hard to describe exactly what The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is about.\nPerhaps that may be due to the fact that the entire plot of the series centers around a girl searching for meaning to her life, seeking the abnormal and the supernatural, thus lending to the relatively aimless nature of the plot. Nonetheless, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a crazy ride from the crazy misleadingly horrible beginning to the epic \"end\". The best way to sum it up in one sentence is Haruhi Suzumiya's own self-introduction: \"I'm not interested in ordinary humans. If there are any aliens, time travelers, or espers here then\n          \n        I ask you to join me.\"\nBeware, the first episode is extremely misleading. Many believe that this first episode is probably one of the greatest episodes in anime history, but to the unprepared viewer, the intent of it may not be completely apparent at first, so it would be wise to at least stick to the end of it for a brief showing of what the series is really about. I'll just say that it's probably not your crappy fansubs.\nThere are many layers to this anime. In addition to that described above, most if not every episode can be seen as a parody, from sports to mecha to even Phoenix Wright. These parodies, however, work together very well to produce a coherent storyline...when the episodes are placed in the correct order of course. Prior experience with a plethora of genres will greatly enhance enjoyment of this series.\nMajor praise to Kyoto Animation for placing an insane amount of detail into production, with the world-class animation, sound, and eye-candy it's well known for. Often there is something interesting occuring in the background that either reveals something for interesting, or is simply a good laugh. It is nearly impossible to notice all the countless references the first time going through, and the whole non-chronological order of the episodes begs for a full rewatch.\nClearly, one of the greatest things about this show is that it is clearly written by an intelligent staff, but the best thing is that even if one is too lazy to notice all the references, interpret the various parodies and overlying themes, and watch it over and over again, this show is still enjoyable on it's own. Each one of the main characters is so likable it's hard to pick a favorite, and even minor supporting characters are alive with hilarious personalities - many supporting characters could probably star in their own series. One of them, Tsuruya-san, has spawned her own 4chan meme as well as a numerous 4koma doujins.\nThere's too much to say about this anime, but this review needs to have limits. A huge explosion of information regarding Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu has already occurred on the internet, much like the information explosion that occurs in the series itself. Anyway, needless to say this anime is a milestone, and could very well bring many a jaded anime fan back. The most significant since Evangelion? Many would definitely agree. Watch. and watch again.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=74,   ["text"]="                          \n    It's been a while since I've seen this series, so I believe this is the right time to write a review. A lot of people sit down and rave about this show after having just seen it, but if you give yourself some time, you can write with a clear head.\nOn with the show. And please, people, let's try to be as unbiased as possible. Just because you thought this show may have been epic win, don't allow that thought to distract you from the facts. Let's read on shall we?\nStory: 7\nThe story is original, I'll give it that. It's a neat idea, but far\n          \n        from epic as some fans make it out to be. When it's not focusing on the main plot, this show is more or less like any other set in this time, place, and atmosphere. A typical high school slice of life, with a pinch of something new. However, it could be improved upon, and is not air-tight. It's good at best, but again, far from epic.\nArt: 7\nThe art is well done. It's not the best I've ever seen, and it's not eye-catching to the degree that some other anime out there are, but it's obviously got a decent budget backing it, and the artists put good work into what they do. At some points there is the odd 'short-cut' that can be caught, but not often, and this is typical of many other series, so it's nothing to really complain about. The show never did air in Hi-Vision, but I suppose I can't knock it for that because of when it aired. I'd say the art in this show is on par with most of the other well animated anime out there, and maybe goes a bit farther. But like a lot of things, it could have been better.\nSound: 8\nThe sound and music in this show was very good, I quite enjoyed it. I think just about anyone will find themselves tapping their toes to some of the tracks and humming along here and there, and it's pleasant to listen to when the background music gets going and not much is happening (when the characters are in-between action scenes or are lazing about like they sometimes are on occasion). Not epic, but very good and enjoyable.\nCharacter: 6\nThis is where I have to give this show a bit of a shake. Although the character development was fair for a show of this length and an aim to be more original by sort of just throwing you in (which worked out in this case), I disliked Haruhi as a main character quite frankly. I know that a lot of fans out there will think 'How could you? She is everything a main character should be!', but I'm afraid I have to disagree. In one word, she is annoying. In another, bitchy, and yet another, completely predictable. I'm sorry to say it fans, but I just don't like her one bit. I gave her a chance, I did all I could to find something I liked about her, but I just can't follow the flock on this one. Otherwise, the other characters are alright, and much more likable.\nEnjoyment: 6\nAt times I enjoyed the show, and at times, I was falling asleep.. I was probably falling asleep more than anything else. I can't really say why, most of the time it was just.. Uninteresting? You get a rather long stretch of nothing much happening in this show (or just something you don't care about much), then you're hit with something spectacular and unexpected. Unfortunately, it just doesn't happen often enough, or you can see it coming all too soon. For the rare occasions where this show caught me off guard and made me go 'wow', I kept its head above the water of a 5. But for the rest, a 6. Fair.\nOverall: 6\nThe show is fair. It has it's faults, and really good things about it as well, but after watching it quite a while ago and writing this with a clear head, it wasn't anything special. It had some neat ideas which were incorporated quite well, but it just didn't have enough kick to it to keep it at the top of my list of shows I really, really enjoyed. It fell down in there with a lot of the rest of them: It was alright.\n        "},

I do not know why this show has been so popular, Really it is almost beyond me why a show like this is considered to be amazing, this is a comedy, but it isn't clever.

We have a main character Haruhi who has no respect for anyone and who tries to create a group of weird people. Group is meant to search for something unusal such as\n          \n        alliens and stuff. Among people that she had gathered happened to be time travelers, alliens and etc.\nYou would think that it would be interesting but sadly not in this series. The characters are simply PLAIN with no personality. \nMikaru - is a dumb, squeeling girl. Her only role in the show was to get molested by Haruhi and present fanservice. The only time when she looked seriouse and worthy for something was when she was telling about her true indentity and when her future self came.\nYuki - same thing as if she never was there to start with. She simply sits and reads books. Though she did help Kyon and is inteligent and had showed interest in games. So I guess out of all friend she is the most decent one.\nItsuki - just buy a scientific encyclopedia and read it, the effect will be the same. His speeches are damn long and boring. All he has are looks.\nKyon - probably the only normal character who actually has personality and who tried to teach Haruhi morals instead of spoiling her even more as others did.\nHaruhi - someone who deserves a beating of a life time. She has no respect for anyone and cares only about herself. How could someone possibly like her is beyond me. \nInstead ofactually finding something interesting, we have a long, dragged episodes of them chatting about scientific topics that can be found in encyclopedia or they are talking some nonsence.\nHumor... there was humor? I definetly didn't see it there. If Haruhi being mean and molesting Mikaru is funny, then sure, there is a lot of humor.\nThe only thing that was interesting, were the episodes of them at the island where a crime had happened. Now that was interesting, everything else is a bunch of garbage. \nWhat made those two episodes special is that Haruhi was not that mean and actually did something decent, it did have a worthy humor, speaches were not that boring, had some twists and of course some detective scenarie which was worth the time.\nAnimation was good though, sad that budget was wasted on something like this.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=50,   ["text"]="                          \n    *Note:  I watched the episodes in chronological order.\nHaruhi Suzumiya was definitely an interesting series, but it wasted much of its potential.\nThe storyline is like a drunkard who forgot where he lives and can't find his way home.  The first half is strong and interesting, and seems to set up great things for the second half.  (The man has a few drinks, maybe finds a lovely lady and begins to chat with her).  However, when we get there, it seems like what was built up to that point is forgotten in favor of a more slice-of-life tone.  (The man's efforts flirting\n          \n        with the lady are wasted as she leaves without anything significant having happened.  He tries to go home, but can't remember where his own house is.)\nDon't get me wrong:  I have nothing against slice of life.  It's actually the setting of the first half anyway (in which more interesting things occur).  But when you build up something that's intriguing/interesting/mysterious/makes me want to find out what happens, shifting the focus to slice-of-life alone makes me feel like the time spent setting up something much bigger is wasted.  It's like the writers forgot what they had even written about to begin with.\nIn short:  I got trolled.  Haruhi is made out to be something of a god, but it's never explained in any way.  Yuki, Itsuki, and Mikuru all have origins/characterization worth exploring, but aren't.  They allude to the possiblity of a romance between Kyon and any of the three heroines manifesting, but none does.\nHaruhi herself is easily the most interesting and unique character in the series--in fact, one of the more unique characters I've ever seen.  However, I couldn't find her likable in any way.  She's pushy, always used to getting her way, and doesn't care about the opinions of others as long as their view is inconvenient to her in any way.  Her distinct personality is a breeding ground for many possible aesops to be had: you can't always get what you want, the opinions of others are important too, you shouldn't treat other people like objects, etc.  But no:  None of these opportunities are taken advantage of.  All we get is Kyon's commentary/observation about her unpleasant personality traits.\nAlso, these characters had lots of room to grow and develop into something better, but didn't.  Kyon could've made good on his promise early on to protect Mikuru from Haruhi's eccentricity and stopped being a huge pushover--Haruhi's slave--but he doesn't.  Haruhi could've learned lessons like what I said above, but didn't.  Yuki could've developed more human emotions, but didn't.\nAND, the last episode spent 95% of its time doing... not much of anything.\n*Big sigh*\nHowever, in spite all these gripes, it's not all bad.  There's lots of laughs to be had.  The animation is beautiful (as you can expect from Kyoto Animation).  The English VAs (especially Kyon's and, to a lesser extent, Haruhi's) are great.\nThe show just had potential to be so much more.\nPS:  Trolls rage-clicking the \"not helpful\" button:  Comment on my profile as to why.

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=49,   ["text"]="                          \n    The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya Review :\nHaruhi Suzumiya is one of the most well known faces in the anime community. Until recently, I had absolutely no idea why the show was so popular, and to be perfectly honest, I still don't. Your going to see this word a lot in my upcoming Angel Beats review: potential. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya had unbelievable potential. While it didn't quite live up to it in the show, it was still very fun to watch and a very good show.\nStory 7/10:\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is about a freshman called Kyon who is quite the cynic and is\n          \n        skeptical about all things supernatural. On the first day of school during role call the girl sitting behind him announces to the class that all aliens, time travelers, and espers come see her immediately. Intrigued by this girl, Kyon begins talking to her and learns her name is Haruhi Suzumiya. They become friends and establish a club called the SOS Brigade where lo and behold an alien named Yuki Nagato, a time traveler named Mikuru Asahina, and an esper named Itsuki Koizumi are forced to join. As time goes by, Kyon learns from the other brigade members that Haruhi is actually able to change the world around her almost like a god. Haruhi is unaware of her powers and of her friends being supernatural beings. Thus the story revolves around preventing Haruhi from getting bored and destroying the world through her subconscious. Now, I watched the show in chronological order (there are 3 ways to watch the show) , and found that the first 6 episode arc was brilliant and absolutely loved it. Unfortunately the episodes to follow were a different story. They were fun yes, but they felt like filler episodes to me, and because the entire series after the first 6 episodes was actually fillers, the ending was abrupt, providing no closure whatsoever. The \"second season\" episodes also felt like filler episodes and the endless eight felt lazy because they could have just shortened it to 3 episodes. I feel like if the series was better paced and had a larger main plot, the show could have been something really special. Thankfully, my desires were met in the movie The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, which is now one of my favorite movies of all time. In short, the story started off with a bang, then fizzed away. \nArt 9/10:\nIt really is amazing that this show came out back in 2006 because the art is fantastic. This is probably one of the main reasons why people have been so attracted to this show. The character designs are all great and they aren't bound to the same set of clothes every day. The wide array of settings are well done and this is just overall a very well produced anime. \nSound 6/10:\nI do not understand where some people are coming from. I watched the dub and the sub version of this show, and in neither did I find the \"superb\" voice acting that everyone was raving about. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, it's actually pretty good, but it's definitely not anything special in MY opinion. Don't hate on me for my OPINION of the voice acting. Many people find the voice acting superb especially for the 2 main characters, unfortunately I did not. I did like how the story was presented with Kyon thoughts however. The real reason I gave this section a 6 (enjoyable) instead of a 7 (good)  was because the music really wasn't anything better than a 5 (average), I found no songs to be catchy, and the mood setting songs (particularly the dramatic ones) often found themselves misplaced in scenes. Overall the sound aspects of the show was above average due to the good voice acting, but not anything really noteworthy. \nCharacters 7/10:\nThe characters in this show were quite good. Haruhi is a sporadic bundle of craziness, Kyon is the cynical voice of reason, and the other 3 leads were over the top stereotypes. Although these 3 were stereotypes, they were so intentionally. Because  haruhi basically wished for these 3 stereotypical characters to be there, they arrived on q. It's satisfying to have an explanation to why the 3 characters are so one dimensional instead of just throwing them at us and expecting us to relate to them. And even though they were stereotypes, they were very well done and a joy to watch. And if the show didn't provide enough for you, the movie really brings them out of their shells and provides much deeper insight on them,  particularly with Yuki. Obviously the strongest characters were Haruhi and Kyon due to their yin and yang type presence in the show. However, there were drawbacks to the characters. My qualms were that Kyon really did complain A LOT, and Haruhi can sometimes come off as a real bitch when she bosses people around. My main issue is just that the characters had almost no development throughout the story. I mean Haruhi developed a lot in the first 6 episodes. But after that there was almost nothing. However, once again the movie answered my prayers on this issue too (see a trend here?). The characters were great, but lack of development really prevented them from being more relatable and and interesting, so in the end I rate them as good, but not anything more. \nEnjoyment 8/10:\nI have no idea why but I REALLY enjoyed watching this show. If there was more closure at the end of the season I most likely would have given this show an 8 (which is a very rare score from me). The tasks that the cast had to do to entertain Haruhi were fun to watch and the first 6 episodes were pretty intense. Maybe it was the characters, or maybe being able to hear all of Kyons thoughts. I really don't know why I enjoyed this show so much. Ultimately with better pacing and a thicker plot, I would have fallen completely in love with this show. \nOverall 7.5/10:\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was a show that I thoroughly enjoyed watching. I can see why some people absolutely love this show, but unfortunately for me it had too many flaws particularly in the pacing and lack of plot after the first 6 episodes to make this truly great. However, if you enjoyed the show like I did, you HAVE to watch the movie: The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, because it is exactly what I was hoping for from the series. I may or may not write a review for it, but just know that it is everything you could ask for in a movie and has become only the 4th anime to ever get a 9/10 or higher from me.\nThe Verdict:\nVery good show that is very fun to watch, gleaming with potential but unfortunately falls short of what it could be. \nPros:\n+Great Characters\n+Fantastic first 6 episodes \n+Amazing art especially for the time\n+Addicting to watch\nCons:\n-Plot dies after 6th episode and climax in the middle of the season\n-Lack of a memorable soundtrack\n-Almost no character development \nIf you liked the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, watch...\nLucky Star:\nEccentric main female lead, plenty of humor, and many references to Haruhi.\nMy Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:\nCynical main male lead and also filled with comedy.\n7.5/10 - Very Good"},

It will keep you guessing right through to the end, which happens to be somewhere in the middle of the series. ^_^\nThis anime may seem like any typical high school comedy, but that is far from it. The story is anything but straight forward because what makes this so original is the jumbled up story. It's noticeable from the beginning as the series starts chronologically on episode 11 and from there the messed up story will confuse you like it did the main character Kyon.\nEven though Haruhi is the titular character Kyon\n          \n        is sort of the lead character and even if he seems like the usual dull and boring male lead, he is surprisingly funny. As he narrates the entire story he constantly comes out with some hilarious witty and sarcastic remarks, which can make any situation funny, like Haruhi's amateur film in the first episode. Haruhi is the titular character of this anime where everything revolves around her. It's pretty difficult to describe her but it's best to describe her personality as hyper-active and outrageously weird. There's a lot of confusing things to find out about her throughout the series, which is what makes her so great and a female character you can't help but love.\nJust what you'd expect from 'Kyoto Animation', the animation quality for this anime is unbelievably great and is probably the best for a non-action anime. It is unbelievable to see the amount of detail is put into it from the rich colour palette to the realistically fluid character movements. For the animation alone, I would give it a perfect 10/10.\nThe music isn't anything special, just the usual stuff you should expect to hear from a school-life comedy. It's the catchy opening and ending themes songs that are what put it above the rest; however there's one episode to look out for when it comes to music, eps. 12 'Live Alive'.\nOverall this anime has to be one extraordinary sci-fi comedy that has something some anime lack, replay-value. This is a show that you'll have to watch over and over in the wrong and right order to fully enjoy it. There's plenty of comedy to enjoy nevertheless there is also some spectacular action sequences. The only problem with this anime is that it can sometimes be hard to follow, especially when Nagato and Koizumi go into their in-depth explanations yet apart from that this is one superb anime.\nWatching this anime is an experience any anime fan should enjoy, so I recommend this to anyone who needs a laugh, whilst being intrigued.\n^_^ \n        "},

Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu (SH) is no ordinary anime. You will see lots of weirdness and strangeness and unexplainable things and.. well it's basically weird. Just see Ep. 1 and you will see what I mean. Suzumiya Haruhi introduces herself as \"I am not interested in ordinary humans. If you are an alien, time traveller, or esper, then contact me\". After that, you will know what awaits.\nHowever, SH is definitely worth seeing. It's got a strange sense of humour that will keep you\n          \n        laughing at some occasions (and that will be some hard laughs, trust me. True LMAO's), while at others, you will just go \"Eh?\" then make a strange face. SH is well made, good animation, good characters, and a nice plot. The background music is cheezy and entertaining. Oh yeah, there is a fair bit of ecchiness too! :D Therefore, there is nothing much to complain about in SH... but it was really worth my time!\n(Side note: Bunny Girl Suzumiya FTW!!)\n- [ Animation = Nothing really amazing = 8 ] -\nThe animation in SH is nothing to be amazed of. There are no real special effects, save for the last few episodes. The overall quality was good. The scenes were well detailed, and so were the backgrounds. It also applies to characters, but in a lesser amount. The characters were well made, but some things about them were unrealistic, like Haruhi's wide smile. I know it's anime, but still.. It's not much to complain about, but just to point out. I do not say that it was bad, but it was unconventional. The whole of SH is unconventional, so I cannot complain.\nThere is not much to say about animation. There is nothing bad, but there are certainly good things. Like I said, the characters were well-designed and some of them definitely cute. The action scenes had no glitches and were smooth enough. There are not many, but they are good. The special effects too are here, scattered through the series. Here too a good job was done.\nOverall, it's a 8. Because personally I was not impressed, but it deserved at least an 8.\n- [ Sound = No comments = 7 ] -\nI do not pay attention to sound usually. Nothing caught my attention here. The background music was satisfactory. The OP and ED were alright, a bit strange in terms of content, but ok. The effects too were ok.\nThe voice actors did their job well, and did specially well in demonstrating the violent emotional outbursts of Haruhi, or the shyness of Mikuru. Not much to say about Yuki since she barely talks.\nOverall, it was alright. Nothing bad.\n- [ Story = Great! Just what I needed = 9 ] -\nNow comes one of the strengths of SH! Now, mind you. The plot is really strange and quite difficult to understand. It's very unconventional for an anime. It doesn't fall in any category I know. It's a great blend of romance, ecchiness, adventure, philosophy, mystery and friendship, together with lots of eccentricity! Not your common anime, ain't it?\nWell, I can guarantee you that you will not get bored with SH. The stories are really amazing. However, don't be surprised if you do not understand everything at one go. Sometimes, you will have the impression that you missed out some episodes. It's normal, trust me. In fact, if you check Wikipedia, you will see that the episodes were aired in a disorderly manner!\nNevertheless, it does make sense! Well, the story revolves about Suzumiya Haruhi who is the main female character, Kyon the main male character, Yuki, Koizumi, Mikuru. As the story proceeds, you will get the opportunity to know the other students of the college. Now, Haruhi is what you will call strange. As introduction to her class, she gave the weird line I said above! Haruhi thinks the world is a boring place without aliens and stuff. As a result, she would do anything to investigate anything strange she comes through.\nSH has a subtle scent of romance that is nice. It doesn't really jump out before the last episode, but you will definitely feel it there. And that is why you will want a second season! Added with its weird philosophy and jumpy action, you've got a real nice mix in the form of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu!\nThis may sound boring here, but it's actually quite interesting. What will keep you sticked is the strange things in the story, and there are lots of them. If you don't believe me, just check SH's marks! SH is really an unbelievable anime. It is interesting in a strange way. Many of the episodes do not make much sense, but you will still watch them and still go on with the remaining episodes. And when it ends, you will want a second season. It is that kind of anime, and a very good one at that. Strange yes, but good! SH's plot cannot be described without actually spoiling things, but I will surely recommend it!\nI hated just one thing. They condensed too much in 14 episodes. SH, for all its greatness, merited at least 20 episodes! I get the impression that the producers kinda rushed it off. But that's just my opinion. Regardless, the ending was extremely good nevertheless. I must admit that the romance part was a bit too short for my liking. And at the end, we do not know what really happens to the characters, that's why I'd like a sequel or an OVA...\nI gave it a 9 because some of the things were too strange for my understanding.. Like what? Like a baseball match that will determine the fate of the world, whether it is destroyed or preserved! Like a baseball bat that has homing mode! And that's only for one episode!\n- [ Characters = The most varied blend I've ever seen = 9 ] -\nI saw Eureka Seven, and I can say there was a fair mix of characters in there. But I really think that SH has set a new record. There are just 5 main characters, but each are radically different from each other. Haruhi is ultra-active, Kyon is quiet, Koizumi agrees too easily to everything, Yuki is too quiet and Mikuru is too shy. As you see, every one of them is an extreme! That is something that kept me engrossed till the end.\nEach of the chracters is fun to discover since they have such distinct personalities. And when you take all of them, stuff them in one room and create a club called SOS DAN, then some serious laughs and fun (and ecchiness) awaits you! And the most interesting thing! Each of the characters (except one) have their own little (big) secret and intents! It may not be evident at first, but each one of them has a role or many roles to play. Just be ready for some serious complexities for Yuki, lots of philosophical stuff for Koizumi, lots of \"iyaaaa\" for Mikuru and lots of raw strangeness for Haruhi!\n- [ Value and Enjoyment = In a strange way, I really enjoyed it = 9+ ]\nSH is not a conventional anime, and it is really refreshing to see some of its kind from time to time. You just sit and watch, without having to use much of your brain. Personally, I really enjoyed it. I knew it was strange and this attracted me more, just to see of what SH was made of. I can say it was worth it!\nThe value and enjoyment lies in the diversity of the characters and the strange things that Haruhi comes up with. Quite an eccentric girl! But so much fun, specially the parodies and the film about Mikuru!\nIt does have a rewatch value, since it is short and since you will want to understand its plot better and discover more of the characters. But do it in order this time. It will make things easier to understand. Check Sentress' review.\n- [ Conclusion ] -\nSH is great! Go watch it and you will surely enjoy it. There is not much to say apart from this. If you are ready to bear with some weirdness, then go for SH. Weird is not really a correct word. \"Unconventional\" is better. This is what makes SH interesting. Just go and watch. It's incredibly difficult to describe SH in words but I say it is worth it. It is extremely successful, so check it out! It's just 14 episodes so it cannot go wrong. It's really a wild roller-coaster ride from the start to the end!"},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=40,   ["text"]="(l to r, clockwise) The SOS Brigade: Kyon, Koizumi, Mikuru, Yuki, Haruhi (center)\nTitle: The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\nNovel, Manga, Radio Dramas/Drama CD, Anime: The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (henceforth refered to as TMoHS) began as a light novel series in Japan, where it is known by the title Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu.  The novels are authored by Nagaru Tanigawa, and illustrated by Noizi Ito.  The first volume was released on June 6th, 2003, and is serialized in the novel magazine The Sneaker, by Kadokawa Shonen, and is currently ongoing, with nine volumes released to date, and a tenth volume due out on\n          \n        June 1st, 2007.  The TMoHS novels have also been released in Taiwan and Hong Kong by Kadokawa Media, and in South Korea by Daiwon CI.  The first novel in the TMoHS series was awarded the grand prize in the 8th annual Sneaker Awards, a prize only awarded two other times.\nTMoHS also has two manga incarnations, based off of the novels.  The first manga adaptation ran from May to December of 2004, and was illustrated by Mizuno Makoto.  This adaptation was canceled and its existence was denied after the first volume, mainly because it diverged wildly from the source material (the novel), the original author had very little input in it, and it was found that the illustrator was producing an H-rated doujinshi related to the material, which unsettled Kadokawa Shonen, the publisher.  The second manga adaptation, illustrated by Gaku Tsugano, and aimed at a younger audience, began running in November of 2005, and is ongoing, with three volumes released to date, and a fourth volume planned for release on June 10th, 2007.  Both adaptations have run in Shounen Ace.\nThree radio dramas based on the anime have also been released by Lantis, with the latest volume released on December 21st, 2006.  A drama CD was also released on January 24th, 2007.\nThe anime adaptation of TMoHS was done by Kyoto Animation, (famous for the Full Metal Panic companion series Full Metal Panic?: Fumoffu and Full Metal Panic!: The Second Raid, along with the 2006 remake of Kanon) and directed by Tatsuya Ishihara (famous for directing Air and Fushigi Yuugi).   TMoHS ran from April 2nd, 2006 to July 2nd, 2006, and consisted of fourteen episodes.  TMoHS has been licensed Stateside by Kadokawa Pictures USA, and sublicensed production and distribution to Bandai Entertainment.  The first volume is due out May 29th, 2007.\nStory: TMoHS focuses around the title character of Haruhi Suzumiya, an oddball who stands up and declares on the first day of high school that if you're not an alien, time traveler, or esper, don't waste her time, and if you are, come join her.  Among other odd quirks of hers, she checked out every club in the school, but never joined any of them, and this is finally what gets her and Kyon (our snarky narrator and the character from whose pov we view most of the series' events from) talking.  From these conversations, she gets the idea to start the Save our world by Overloading it with fun Suzumiya Haruhi Brigade (or SOS Brigade for short), and Kyon is roped into helping her, whether he really wants to or not.  Besides her and Kyon, Haruhi ropes in Yuki (a quiet female member of the now-defunct Literary Club who doesn't care what they do so long as she can read), and Mikuru (a small, timid second-year girl with a cute face and big breasts (Haruhi even encourages Kyon to grope them! o.O; ), and, as described by Haruhi, 'a lolita'), and Koizumi (a mysterious transfer student).  \nI want to say more, but doing so would spoil a good part of the series for you.  You'll just have to watch and find out what happens.  ^^\nStory Critique: TMoHS' story rawqs my socks.  Kyon's snarky narration makes each episode priceless.  The mix of normal school life and paranormal makes for quite the episodes, especially given our quirky characters.  The series does have a sci-fi twist to it, but, given our title character, this doesn't seem out of the ordinary at all, and the surreal situations that are found in this series simply become par for the course.\nAn oddity about this series is that it wasn't broadcast in chronological order.  If you do like your stories told in chronological order, the order to watch the episodes in is: 2, 3, 5, 10, 13, 14, 4, 7, 6, 8, 1, 12, 11, 9.  \nGiven the choice between the two ways to watch the series, I would stick with the way I watched it: broadcast order.  Yes, watching it in broadcast order does mean that there will be frequent jumps in the episodes that will leave you confused and wondering just what the hell is going on.  But that's part of the fun of this series.  And, comparing the two episodes that the series can end on, given these orders, I find the broadcast order gives you the more satisfying ending.\nArt:  Kyoto Animation is known for their dedication to quality in animation, and it really shows here.  The characters have several different outfits that they can be seen in, so there's plenty of variety, and the designs for characters and backgrounds themselves are amazingly detailed.  The anime tends to use very rich colors, which gives that series that much more of a paranormal or normal feel, depending on the situation.\nMusic: I couldn't care less about the OP for this series.  But the ED rawqs my socks, and then some.  I am actually going out of my way to learn the dance it showcases.  And the background music for the series is the first that I've actively noticed and liked for quite some time.  And the insert songs for the twelfth episode... God.  \nIf anyone knows where I can find the soundtrack for the series, link me up NOW.\nSeiyuu:  I don't have any issues with the seiyuu, as normal.  Every voice choice matches their character perfectly.\nDub: N/A\nLength:  This is the only area where TMoHS has issues.\nAt first, I was perfectly fine with fourteen episodes.  Though I wanted more, I was thoroughly satisfied with the end to the series.  And then I found out that the source material is ongoing. Like Kino no Tabi, the anime itself only covered a fraction of the original story, and it's insanely popular, so they don't have too much of an excuse for not continuing it.   There are rumors of a second season, however.\nThe other issue that I have is that there's a single episode that takes up half the series.\nOverall:  An excellent series, with quirky characters, beautiful art, addictive music that deserves the second season that's been rumored.\nStory: 8/10\nArt: 9/10\nMusic: 7/10\nSeiyuu: 8/10\nLength: 8/10\nOverall: 40/50; 80% (B)\n\nThe SOS Brigade (from the ED), The SOS Brigade's symbol\n        "},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=38,   ["text"]="                          \n    I keep seeing the people who like it making reviews here. Now let me speak my side (the side that totally hates it)\nI'm not a person that can like a series just because of the main character looks/personality. Personally i don't care if Haruhi is this or is that. For me a good anime series needs to have a solid story where everything fits and good character interaction.\nThis series are a set of events pointing to haruhi's ability to fulfill her wishes without noticing, each episode gives a hint of the story but thats it, only a hint nothing else.\nMostly is like saying: \"this is\n          \n        how our story is supposed to be, now watch all this side-story eps somehow related to it\"\nNow to make things worst eps are not even in the correct order? Man you just lost 50% of your audience right here no matter how popular it is.\nI dont know about the 2nd season but for me 1st season was a major disaster and a colossal disappointment. I just watched because it read nothing but good reviews about it. I really was expecting a great series that keep me wanting to see next episode, i watched it all trying to see where the greatness were but believe me, my mind dropped it in the very first eps.\nThere goes another anime for merchandising purposes only...how many haruhi dolls/t-shirts are they selling? :)\nHonestly, i compare this to Clannad, just that in Clannad they didnt play dumb and made it \"normal\" :)\nHaruhi sure has a great potential but please in the future make it less surrealist XD\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=35,   ["text"]="                          \n    After the rise of Full Metal Panic! 2nd & Air, Kyoto Animation create something different but effective that makes the anime world order into a shimmy like an earthquake. Yes, this is The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya !. In the era of 2006, this series became a big hit in Japan and became one of the most popular anime in the history of anime. Haruhi also has a very huge fanbase, lovers might very highly praised the series, while haters may think the show is rubbish.\nThat was a little glimpse of the series, but what about the story itself? The series told us about a\n          \n        high school boy known as Kyon who encounters Haruhi Suzumiya, an eccentric school girl who somehow possesses unconscious abilities that can alter or rewrite the universe. One of the good things contained in this anime is the unique premise, a bizarre yet genius idea for an anime which makes the audience interested in what was happening in the story. If you remember Baccano! & Ergo Proxy, the same narrative technique is contained in this anime. The anime present their plot in nonlinear order, some of you may think the plot is mess up or bad, but it’s not. A non-linear narrative is a narrative technique that often used in novels, film, & other media, some people may think “It’s confusing” or “What is happening?!!”. Actually, this is not a mistake, but rather a narrative technique, and if you pay attention and understand the story correctly, you certainly know what really happens. Many blamed the filler in this 14 episodes. Of course, with that short episodes, the director should be more focused the story to a better path, instead of exacerbating the situation by putting in place fan service.\nFor the 2006 era, the animation of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu really exceeded the given standard. The character is not rigid in their movement, light and shading effect is quite good, although sometimes the character became less detail if the screen were zoom out. But for 2006, the animation is very good. \nSound settings are fairly good, OP / ED its very easy to remember also the voice actor is very good, with good design and sound matching, the character becomes rigid and easy to remember.\nThe character in this anime is often tagged as “unoriginal” and “typical stereotype”, we have a certainly simple character division. We have the Eccentric & Bossy Heroine, the Lackey Male Lead, the Genius Stoic, the Clumsy Crybaby (she is the fan service doll), and the Charismatic Transfer Student. Despite of that, Haruhi Suzumiya actually became a symbolic character that even becoming a byword in her triumphed era, the charismatic of Haruhi Suzumiya is beyond the boundary. There is some minor character development we got from our main character (Haruhi).  Other main characters do their roles pretty well, but one-dimensional.  Some supporting characters appear just for plot devices. Nevertheless, the main characters is pretty memorable and unforgettable.\nWell, if you into Sci-Fi and prefer a unique setting in Slice of Life, this anime might be recommended. But if you seek for character development & other things, seek another door. Anyway the show really put a lot of enjoyment that can even make you addicted if you love all of the aspects. It is a fairly good series indeed.\n        "},

This is truly a show for intellectuals!\"\n(insert math formula here)\nYeah, I can copy/paste too you bastards!\n Haruhi director be not proud, though some have called you brilliant and visionary, for thou art not so!\nSpoilers!\nStory: 4/10\nThe story is that God, the creator of the universe, is an awful high school brat that must be kept entertained or else she will destroy the universe. Many people come from across time and space\n          \n        to entertain this most grating of protagonists in order to save existence. It is possible to have an absurdist, nihilistic plot and make it entertaining and clever. For better examples look at Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Hell, look at any of the Disgaea games, those are WAY better than Haruhi! The plot isn't that clever, entertaining, or rewarding for the viewer. It is self indulgent trash that wishes to join the ranks of the titans of absurdism. It is like something Samuel Beckett would write after having a lobotomy!\nCharacters: 2/10\nI HATE the characters in this show. I hate Haruhi! I hate Kyon! I hate them all! The characters don't really amount to anything besides tired anime cliches and at no point do they allow the viewer to empathize with them or care about them. The show does attempt some character development, but I really don't think it does very well in that regard. The worst part about the characters is how unbelievably obnoxious they all are! I have seen a lot of annoying anime characters, but this was a complete overload that left me so angry I couldn't see straight.\nArt: 8/10\nThe art is actually quite good. That is the best part of the show honestly. Of course, the show did have a huge budget, so you would expect the production value to be decent.\nSound: 2/10\nHaruhi has my least favorite opening in all of anime! Even the Love Hina opening isn't as infuriatingly stupid and sickening as this one. The rest of the soundtrack is also rage inducingly awful. The composer once wrote the Rocket Knight Adventures OST for the Sega Genesis! What the HELL happened! Did she sell her musical talent to the devil in order to pay off her student loans?! The Devil paid the loans, but replaced her talent with a new type of musical talent that could only make music to please him and praise the name of Lucifer!\nEnjoyment: 1/10\nWatching this series is enjoyable in the way that repeatedly punching yourself in the scrotum is enjoyable.\nOverall: 4/10\nAs much as I absolutely HATE this series, it would be unfair to give it below a 4. Why? The art is actually quite good, and the director at least tried to create an absurdist masterpiece and had ambition, even though it failed horribly in my opinion. The show is deeply flawed, but at least it represented one man's vision and not a team of marketers trying to cash in on the latest craze. At least it wasn't about a bishounen hero that slays zombies in an MMORPG world while dating a harem of G cup women! I also gave it an extra point from the fact that I am no doubt bias against the series due to my strong hatred of its fandom. In other words, my feelings towards zealous fans should not color my review of the work itself, and therefore to protect objectivity I felt an extra point was warranted.\n"},

People blame it on that i watched in Chronologically order but how the hell was i suppose to know that i need to watch it on release order? If the people who made this anime where smart they make the chronologically order the release order or something like that. I also had a hard time liking the character is this anime. Yuki is just a rip off of Rey from NGE but stronger. Haruhi is all bossy. Mikuru has no spine but\n          \n        her cuteness forgives that. Cant really say anything bad about Kyon. The one i kind of liked was Itsuki. The story if this anime has something too do with a young girl having the power of God and that is also the problem is this anime. I sounds cool when you hear it but the problem is they dont use to that much. If they did i might have liked this anime more. Another think i noticed around the world and website is that people like the dance and music of this anime where much. Fore me Hare Hare Yuki is boring to watch and too listen( i enjoy the Lucky Star dance more and the music to the opening).

When the show first aired, it took the entire world by storm. Spawning many shows that tried to replicate its success and quality, Haruhi is simply a show that cannot be replicated.\n\nStory(9/10)- The first thing I noticed when I first watched this show was, I had no idea what the hell was going on. The episodes seems scattered because the episodes were not in chronological order. I had a hard time keeping track of what would happened and generally complained about it. It wasn't until I finished the show that I\n          \n        truly appreciated the broadcast order. The show doesn't give a damn about the viewer, they are just dragged along for the ride, similarly to how Haruhi takes Kyon on adventures against his will.\n Although Haruhi is marketed as the star of the show, it is Kyon, the narrator, arguably runs the entire show.The story is told from the point of view. He narrates sarcastically, usually mocking the various absurdities that arise due to Haruhi and The \"SOS Brigade.\" shenanigans.  Comedy is the strongest point in this show. When it comes to the wit, cleverness, and consistancy of the jokes, you will find no anime that can rival Haruhi. The 'Falcon Kick,' and the Phoenix Wright references are the funniest moments in the show. The show has unlimited replay value. I enjoyed watching the show the second time, as much as I did the first.\nArt(9/10)- The animation in this show is some of the greatest out there, bar none. There is not one person, not even people who hate this show, who can deny how beautiful it is. All the scenes are fluid, lavish, and vibrant. There is never a dip in quality. The directing of the show is a bit wonky, but so is the show itself. A lot of of unusual camera angles and design choices catch the eye of the viewer. This cements KyoAni as one of the greatest studios out of there production wise.\nSound(7/10)- The soundtrack did not really stick out aside from a few tracks. You have the addicting ed \"Hare Hare Yukai,\" that spawned thousands of internet videos. Then you have the OP \"Bouken Desho Desho?\" which gives you the feeling of adventure. Other than those tracks, I can't remember anything else that resonated with me.\nCharacter(9/10)- Although Kyon is the star of the show, one cannot deny Haruhi's insurmountable presence on screen. She dominates every scene she is in, with her controlling, eccentric presence. The best thing is she never changes. There is no overly dramatic backstory, or twist that changes her entire personality, she maintains her personality. The rest of the cast, Yuki(an Alien), Mikuru(A Time traveller) and Koizumi(An Esper) are not slacks either. Their behaviors often make Kyon's remarks more funnier. \nThe best part of this show has to be Kyon and Haruhi's love/hate relationship. When Haruhi's plans go too far, Kyon is there to return balance, both literally and figuratively to the world. Although Kyon disagrees with almost everything she does, he is drawn to her. They both have a strong bond of loyalty, one that can never be broken. It is their complex relationship that can set this show apart from others.\nWe people look back at how anime was 10 years ago, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya will undoubtedly be mentioned as one of the pioneers of modern anime. Beautiful visuals, hilarious dialogue and eccentric characters propels Haruhi to the honor of being one of the best anime ever released. I give Haruhi a 9/10.\n        "},

Nothing about it bore an indistinguishable mark of excellence that you expect when you see something, well, excellent.  Yet, when all's said and done, Melancholy leaves behind a feeling of calming enjoyability, something to assure us all that, while the world out there can be big and scary, our own worlds will always be there as a relief.\nCharacterization.  It's the strongest part of Melancholy,\n          \n        yet having said that, the story is filled with endless caricatures, of individuals without depth.  In fact, the only two real characters in the story are Kyon and Haruhi herself - everyone else is a reflection of a particular trait or aspect of the world around them.  I suppose that makes sense plot-wise - after all, everyone else was essentially conjured up by the sheer boredom of Haruhi.  Instead, Melancholy replaces quantity with quality, sharing with us two pristine examples of how characterization should be done, not only in anime, but in all stories in general.  \nWe learn of the events of the story from Kyon, a sarcastic, wise-cracking high-schooler, much like you or I might have been at that age.  He's cynical, yet a hopeless romantic, blas&Atilde;&copy;, yet still deeply caring when he wants to be.  In essence, he's imperfection personified: a true, down-to-earth human being who is already struggling with just living out his own life (you can just hear the pressure in the tone of his voice) without having to deal with some crazy psycho-lady who believes in the existence of aliens, espers, and all that jazz.  His interactions with Haruhi are akin to an older brother playing along with the facile fantasies of an overimaginative younger sister.  Yet, within his nonchalant annoyedness during the escapades of the SOS Brigade, his side of caring shines through.  You could imagine Kyon to be one of those guys who gets dragged along by his overbearing girlfriend to a bunch of things he doesn't really care about.  While you can tell that they really don't want to be there, day after day they're still by their lady's side.\nKyon's lady is not your average lady though.  Take the most out-of-touch, fantasy-dwelling, 'I'm a superhero' five year-old you know, and then square that, and you might have someone who can come close to comparing with the eccentricities of Haruhi.  We shouldn't blame her though, she's just vocalizing everything that we each have wondered or questioned ourselves at some point in our lives.  She is frank, if nothing else, yet at the same time, much like Kyon, an image of imperfection.  Haruhi is exceedingly selfish (or, more correctly, self-absorbed).  At the beginning, she can't seem to fathom when anyone would not think of the world in her terms, and places all those who can't (i.e. the rest of the human race) in a category that is below her associating with.  Perhaps part of that is because we normal humans cannot identify with the candor of Haruhi in our conscious state, but whatever it is, Haruhi begins the tale obsessed with only finding out who in her high school is a time traveler, or esper, or alien.  Haruhi's evolution throughout is really the subject of this anime, and the way that the world is truly opened up to her by Kyon suggests the cure to all of our melancholies.  By the end, she's softened up considerably, and while she still has her unique quirks of searching the universe for strange beings, she is also more responsive to the people around her in the 'real world'.\nUnfortunately, the perfection reached by Melancholy in the characterization process is marred by the faults made elsewhere.  Most notably is the anachronistic presentation of the episodes.  Many fans of the Haruhi series have stated that by presenting the series out of order, it opened up avenues of creative freedom for the writers to fully flesh out the characters in a plot-limited environment.  While that is true, and the development of the characters progress mostly linearly throughout the series, the time gaps and discontinuities created by the at times haphazard ordering of episodes tends to present a distraction to the viewer, rather than supporting the overarching development of the plot and characters.  The most glaring fault in the continuity is dialogue - too often characters refer to events that have already happened, but have not yet been shown.  And these aren't just casual references, you're actually supposed to figure out what's going on in a given episode by the back references to events that you (as the viewer) know absolutely nothing about.  I still think that the series could have been presented in the way that it was, but some rewriting of the references are definitely in order, so that there is some linearity in dialogue at least, if not in plot.\nMy recommendation though is still to watch the series in broadcast order.  Having watched it in chronological ordering, the series loses the charms of the character development.  Give the wacky, loopy plot presentation a chance, and you will be rewarded by the anime with the greatest character development since, well, forever.\n        "},

Well, actually, I kinda do. I guess I got the impression that this show's popularity was more internet bandwagoning than anything of any real merit, so the hype just flew right past me. After finally watching it from beginning to end, though, I completely fell in love with it.\nSuzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu feels in many ways like an experiment. For example,\n          \n        the first episode drops you straight into a shockingly bad amateur video made by the main characters. D: The episodes are deliberately aired out of chronological order, with no explanation given. \nAaanyway, the layered-ness of the series is outstanding. It's fairly episodic, and yet, you start to find a rhyme and reason to the things that are happening, and it just clicks.\nIt's hard to describe the setting and concept without giving away spoilers, so I won't. Suffice to say nothing is quite what it seems at first, and you'll get to see sci-fi fantasies parodied until the world's dignity has been shredded.\nThere are some things I'm less keen on though; notably the excessive fan service from Mikuru, whose sole purpose seems to be getting groped, forced into humiliating and/or sleazy costumes, found in various states of undress, etc. D: It's about as subtle as a boot to the head. Still, it's played for laughs and I guess this was added to further expand popularity. \nI'm giving this series a thumbs up for the comedy, original ideas, weirdness and great production. The opening and ending songs are great too. ESPECIALLY THE DANCE. HARUHI FTW! :D\n"},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    I was very skeptical going into the The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya especially after watching Gigguk's review on the series but I still watched it even with all the skepticism. Therefore I'm glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised.\nThe Story-6\nTo be honest there is not a whole load of story within this series due to its rather episodic nature. However having said that there are certain arcs that were very interesting and fun to watch such as the first arc. Even then there are individual episodes that are very good such as the gaming episode, the baseball episode and the concert episodes but these\n          \n        are far and few in between. Also the pacing of the episodes and series in general is very strange and can be off putting as it moves from being very slow to very fast at a drop of the hat similar to the titular character.\nThe Art-8\nAs per usual with Kyoto Animation the quality of the animation is very high for most of the series. The character movements are fluid and crisp and the overall art style of the anime is pleasant on the eye. However there are certain parts of the anime where the quality drops and the detail of the facial feature and the faces themselves do drop at certain points.\nSound-7\nThe sound was nothing to boast about but at the same time not bad. Throughout the anime the music is appropriate for the setting and the mood but not very memorable. The only two tracks worth of any mention are the OP and the ED which are very catch, fits the anime to a T and brilliantly choreographed. As I've only watched the dub I can't comment on the quality of the original voice acting but as for the English Dub I can say that the show is stolen (yet again) by Crispin Freeman who voices Kyon portrays his laid back attitude perfectly.\nCharacter-6.5\nNow this is the section of this anime which comes under the most flak as people see the characters as just certain stereotypes and I can see where they are coming from. This is because all the characters do fit into stereotypes but they way in which they are portrayed is unique, especially Kyon, the narrator and the main character within the anime. His personality is laid back, skeptical and sarcastic which make him a likeable character amongst a hyperactive girl, an emotionless doll, a cutesy moe fan-service girl and a goody-two-shoes. However none of the characters really develop through the series which is a gripe that I have with but on the whole the characters are enjoyable to watch but nothing spectacular.\nEnjoyment-9.5\nNow this is the pleasant surprise that I mentioned at the start, that is if you made it this far, is that I really enjoyed the show and I felt guilty for doing so. I don't understand why but this show brought a smile to my face and kept it there for almost the entirety of the show and even with its many flaws.\nOverall the show is 7.4 out of 10 and I would recommend this to anyone who can turn off their perceptive sense and just smile throughout most of its entirety. Also the first episode can be off putting but trust me watch till the end of the episode and you should be fine.\nI hope you enjoyed the review or found it helpful. This is my first review so any feedback would be much appreciated =D        \n        "},

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=15,   ["text"]="                          \n    This review is a review of the entirety of Haruhi Suzumiya's anime series (both season one and two), excluding the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, since that movie really doesn't fit the tone of the origional series. Mini-review of the movie: IT'S AMAZING.\nNow on with the actual review.\nPLOT:\nGoing into this show, I expected something like Angel Beats; a high school romantic comedy type anime that features supernatural elements. In this sense, I wasn’t disappointed. I just thought that the supernatural elements would be more on the foreground instead of in the background. In which sense I was disappointed.\nThe idea that an obnoxious high school girl is\n          \n        God is genius. No other way to describe it. It opens so many routes and possibilities. And the anime tries to explore them, it really does, but I just feel like it could’ve done so much more if it hadn’t tried to stick to the high school comedy that it is. \nThroughout the show, characters (mostly Koizumi) hint towards some war going on behind the scenes. People want Haruhi, they want to see what she can do, they want Kyon dead just to see what would happen, they want Haruhi dead because she is a threat, all sorts of things are hinted at, but never shown (well, except for one thing, but still very briefly). Which I think is the show’s biggest flaw. I wanted to see those elements explored, and I wanted to see how our heroes would react if Haruhi’s life was actually endangered.\nInstead, what we got was a high school comedy in which Haruhi’s powers are mostly explored through various every day scenarios, that, while mostly entertaining, can be horribly bland and drawn out\n(*cough*EndlessEight*cough*). \nThis may also be because I really don’t care about high school or slice of life, and fans of those things should have no complaints about the story whatsoever. \nCHARACTERS:\nThe characters in this show all fit into nice little stereotypes/character tropes:\nHaruhi Suzumiya: The bipolar ADHD girl that wants her childhood fantasies to be real. She is eccentric, does not abide by any moral code, and more stubborn than any character than I have ever seen. She is also God(-ish).\nKoizumi Itsuki: The passive-aggressive esper that just loves to invade Kyon’s personal space and is basically the information-tap of the show. He also has a permanent smile on his face, which is so fake it almost hurts to look at. (I should probably also mention that I love this d*ck)\nMikuru Asahina: The cry-baby of a loli that is always the victim of Haruhi’s sexual promotion stunts. The fan-service girl of the show. Also, really, really annoying to watch. Lastly, she is a time-traveler.\nYuki Nagato: The token emotionless doll. She is a total badass when she comes into action and is an alien. Her powers are also very similar to Haruhi’s, being able to rewrite the data of this world, but the show never addresses this, so we're just supposed to ignore that.\nKyon: This is actually his nickname, since the show never bothered to give him a real one (odd choice). He is best described in one word: sarcastic. \nThroughout the show, Kyon constantly gives long-suffering and sarcastic commentary on Haruhi’s actions, which I, in the beginning, had a hard time getting used to, but when I did, had me smiling. He makes this show. I know people say it’s Haruhi, but it really isn’t. Without Kyon there to give a well-needed different perspective, a lot of the jokes would fall flat. He is also very relatable and really just your average school boy, except that he is ‘The Chosen One’, in massive airquotes.   \nThis means that Haruhi has taken a liking to him, and that he is essentially her punching bag that must be protected at all costs, as without him, there would be nobody to keep God on a leash. He is the only one without powers in the SOS Brigade and not really sticking to one character trait.\nNow, for my actual opinion about the characters (even though the description wasn't that unbiased to begin with):\nLet’s get this clear: I. Hate. Haruhi. Yes, I actually went there. \nIt’s not even her personality that makes her annoying, that’s something I actually find enjoyable. I love eccentric ADHD kids. I really do. It’s just the amount of bullsh*t she can get away with that makes me wanna punch her. \nBecause she is God, the majority of the SOS Brigade constantly tries to please her. Koizumi, Mikuru and Yuki all go along with whatever it is that she planned. Kyon tries to stop her, but his pleas fall on deaf ears. This is hilarious sometimes, but other times, I really don’t find the things that Haruhi does funny.\nFor example, play this scenario out in your head: You are the chief of the computer club. You have just bought a new, expensive computer with your club money. Then, suddenly, a girl bursts in, forcing a cute loli along with her, demanding your best computer. You say no, of course, since you need it. Then, she suddenly grabs your hand, puts it over the loli’s breast (while the loli is nearly crying, mind you), and snaps a picture before you can pull away. She declares that she has now evidence of you sexually harassing said loli, and proclaims that if your club tries to vow for you and say it was forced, she will tell the teachers that they were all planning to gang rape her. Then, she blackmails you into giving the computer, and takes off smiling. \nDoes that sound funny? It might seem funny on screen, but if this was a real life situation, this would be beyond fucked up. This is molestation and rape we are making jokes about. Molestation and rape. I do not find that funny.\nAnd there are lots of scenes like that throughout the show, and it just annoys me. Not all necessarily revolving around molestation, but other things that just surpass my moral limits. The SOS Brigade goes along with it, and never even tries to stop her. Halfway through the show, I was just sitting there going: ‘Slap her. Please slap her.’ And when it finally seemed like Kyon would do that, he was stopped by Koizumi. Because God forbids that she is put in her place! (Pun so intended)\nSo, I dislike Haruhi. Immensely.\nThe other characters are underdeveloped. I just find Mikuru annoying because she is constantly crying (though there is this fantheory floating around that this is just a farce, because the elder!Mikuru does actually seem competent. I find this a very interesting idea and support it), Yuki never really gets a personality so I never care about her, and Koizumi is funny, but a real asshole. Kyon is the only one with a varied personality, and even he is never fully developed.\nIn short, I think the characters are the worst part of the show.\nENDLESS EIGHT:\nEndless Eight is a story arc that takes up eight episodes that follow each other up (the way I watched this show at least, with both seasons interwoven). \nThis can technically be considered a spoiler, but really, everybody should know about this arc going in.\nThe arc takes place during the last two weeks of the summer vacation. Or rather, the over five thousand loops of the last two weeks of summer vacation. You see, Haruhi felt like she missed something during her summer vacation, and unconsciously set the weeks to a loop. The loops will keep going on until she gets what she wants.\nThe problem: the characters loose there memory after every loop, making them think this is the first time. So they can’t really make any progress in discovering what Haruhi wants, making this mission almost impossible. The only one who remembers every loop is Yuki, and she was told not to intervene. So how can our heroes solve this?\nWhy, by doing the exact same thing over and over again, of course!\nEight episodes long.\nYou see the problem?\nThe eight episodes this takes place in are almost identical. Sure, the animation and dialogue are a bit different, but this doesn’t make it any more entertaining to watch. It’s the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over until you ask yourself: ‘Why was I watching this again?’\nNow, to be fair, it does serve a purpose. It provides major character development for Yuki, for one. It is not really noticeable, but when you see the Disappearance (yes, I know I was going to leave that movie out of this, but screw the rules), you can find it. Also, it gives a small look into her pain. We had to sit through this eight times. She had to sit through this for more than five thousand times. Five. Thousand.\nBut overall, it just doesn’t hold a candle to the annoyance that this story arc causes. The version of the show I watched had twenty-eight episodes: that means that this arc is almost one third of the anime. One third. It was not worth it.\nAlso, Yuki said that sometimes, things went differently. They got other part-time jobs, skipped some activities, etcetera. If they had shown us those times, this would’ve been a lot more enjoyable, because then there would be a difference. \nThey could also have stopped the runtime at four episodes. That way, we would’ve felt the pain, but not for as long enough for the novelty to wear of completely.\nBut all in all, considering the amount of character development it provides for Yuki, I say that you should at least watch its first two episodes and its last one. Maybe one in the middle as well. That way, you will get the story, but won’t be bored that badly\nSOUND AND ANIMATION:\nThe animation is very good, at Kyoto Ani's normal standards. The art itself however is rather bland, though that could have been done on purpose. I do like the touch in the first episode where the colors are gray until Haruhi pops up. That was very clever. \nIn the sound department: I hate it. I normally dislike the soundtrack of high school centered shows, and this is no exception. It's just too cheerful for me. This is just a personal preference, however, as the sound does fit the show and other people should have no problem with it. \nSUMMARY:\nI did not enjoy this show as much as I hoped to. The story didn’t get enough depth, the characters aren’t developed, and I just found myself bored throughout the majority of the series. \nHOWEVER.\nI cannot stand here in good conscience and say that this anime is bad. Even at its weakest, I can see why people like it. It takes the common high school drama and gives it a very unique twist. The reason why I couldn’t get into it was more because of personal preferences than anything else.\nThe setting is genius. The idea that God might be a high school student is great and opens many possibilities. It’s just sad that they didn’t get explored as much as I think they could’ve been.\nAll in all, this is a decent anime. I would recommend it to everyone who likes high school comedies and/or romantic comedies (though the romance part is very downplayed, so if you don't like it, don't worry, you can just ignore it like I did), and doesn’t mind the supernatural. If you are only in it for the supernatural, however (like me), give it a pass. While some story arcs will be enjoyable, the majority is just boring, and the characters won’t keep you interested, either. "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is perhaps the most intimidating anime I have ever watched. It has a somewhat harsh divide between fans and haters, and everyone that considers it thinks, “How exactly do I go about watching this?” The second season has a less than stellar score of 7.28 in the MAL community, and the first season’s score is only 8.07. With all of these things considered, is The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya really worth all of the trouble it is to watch it? \nWell, first of all, watching it really isn’t too much trouble. Secondly, MAL’s scores can be misleading. And lastly, hell\n          \n        yes it's worth the watch! \nI think the first thing I should address in this review is also the most irrelevant thing. That is, how you should watch The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Just in case you’re not in the know, the order of the episodes that aired do not exactly follow the order of the events that occur in the anime’s timeline. For example, the events in the fifth episode occur before the events in the fourth episode according to the timeline of the anime. That’s when everyone asks: “Should I watch the episodes in airing order or chronological order?”\nI personally watched the anime in its chronological order. That order would be:\n1. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya Parts 1-6\n2. The Boredom of Haruhi Suzumiya\n3. Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody (2009)\n4. Mysterique Sign\n5. Remote Island Syndrome Parts 1-2\n6. Endless Eight Parts 1-8 (2009, and yes, I watched the whole thing)\n7. The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya Parts 1-5 (2009)\n8. Live Alive\n9. The Day of Sagittarius\n10. Someday in the Rain\n11. The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, of which I have not seen at the time of writing this.\nEven though I have watched both seasons simultaneously, I won’t consider the 2009 episodes as I write this review.  \nRegarding which route is better for the first watch…I’m not entirely sure. I mean, both paths have their downside. The downside to the airing order is that you will hear the characters discuss events in the story that haven’t actually happened yet, which is certainly annoying. The downside to the chronological order is a bit less simple. You see, in my opinion, the best episodes in the series (not just the first season, but the whole series) are The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya Parts 1-6. And by best, I mean 20/10 awesome episodes! But if you watch the anime in chronological order, by episode 6 out of 28, you’ve already hit the pinnacle of the whole series. And while all of the other episodes are certainly good (except for Endless Eight), you finish the series off with Someday in the Rain, which is the most boring episode of season 1. My suggestion? If you don’t have friends that have seen it to recommend a route to you, I suggest you watch the whole series in chronological order once, and then become an airing order purist whenever you re-watch it.\nWith all of that out of the way, it’s time to answer the big question: What is The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya actually about? Well, it is about a girl named Haruhi Suzumiya, and it would be no understatement to say the world pretty much revolves around her. She is beautiful, flamboyant, eccentric, and she wants nothing to do with the mundane and the routine. And the best thing is that when she wants something, she gets it! Yes, the desires of this young woman have the power to unravel the rules of the universe and change them according to her will. \nPart of her will includes meeting some strange and unique people and living life to the fullest. Three of these people include the shy and beautiful Mikuru Asahina, the quiet and distant Yuki Nagato, and the witty and mysterious Itsuki Koizumi. All three of them have something very special about them for our main male protagonist to discover. That man is none other than Kyon!\nKyon, who for some reason has no last name, is either the luckiest or most unlucky person in the world. Unlike Haruhi and the other main characters, Kyon is just a normal guy. A big trophy for him is that he’s the first normal person that Haruhi has ever let speak to her. Once this happens, the you-know-what hits the fan, and living a normal life will no longer be possible for Kyon. He usually acts as a voice of reason among the group, and he is also quite funny and charming in his own way. One of my favorite things about The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is that he consistently acts as a narrator for the series, and is quite effective at doing so. \nCast-wise, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya does a great job at deviating from typical character tropes. I guess Haruhi is a tsundere, seeing how she shows up on MAL’s list of best tsunderes in anime, but I didn’t really see her that way. Yuki is a flat out kuudere, but I think her backstory and development make for realistic explanation for her behavior. Kind of like Rei Ayanami from Evangelion, she’s a kuudere because she’s not just another regular person. Now, Mikuru is just so wonderfully adorkable. She’s not airheaded or anything. She’s just a beautiful girl whose really shy, which makes it easy for Haruhi to take advantage of Mikuru’s beauty. There’s also a special twist to Mikuru’s character that allows for some extra dynamics that aren’t seen in the rest of the cast. Lastly is Itsuki. While I think he is a good character, he didn’t strike me in the same way as the rest of the characters. Still, his role was very much needed to balance the cast out.\nMore about the story, it is mostly comprised of school antics rather than having an over-arching conflict. Episodic content is one of its strengths. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is in fact a school anime, as everything interesting always happens at school. Haruhi is dissatisfied with the monotony of the school and starts a new club, which becomes filled with the main cast. The club’s goal is anyone’s guess. It may just be a club for satisfying Haruhi’s boredom. Regardless, the setting is perfect for a romantic comedy. Notice that I said “romantic” comedy. And, if you look at the show’s page on MAL, it has the romance genre tagged onto it. In all truth…I don’t see it as romantic. While Kyon does “like” Haruhi, I never saw him as being attracted to her in the romantic sense. Now, he certainly is fond of Mikuru, but that’s a different story.   \nThe technicalities of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya are certainly up to KyotoAni-standards. Also, the show definitely has its moments visually. I never pay too much attention to a soundtrack unless it’s the focal point, but sound was never an issue. In fact, I enjoyed a lot of the show’s tracks.\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya has a lot going for it, including fun episodic content, a unique cast that transcends norms, as well as an undeniably effective sense of humor. It is not perfection however, as the multiple watching routes present confusion to a new viewer. A couple episodes fail to live up to the standard it sets for itself, and the lack of conflict may turn people off. While I wouldn’t label it a masterpiece, it has certainly raised my standard for what a masterpiece is, and the legacy it leaves is one to be respected.

It will also briefly reference elements from the second season and the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, but will refrain from spoiling them.\nOne of the most influential works in the history of anime, the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya gained relevancy with its meta elements, which clearly appealed to anime watchers at the time. But throughout the years,  as new titles rose to relevancy, its influence is no longer as prominent. Some argue that  the show remains special to this day while others disagree and claim that aside from the influence\n          \n        it once had, there is little merit to the series.  It is therefore appropriate to examine how well the series holds on its own and whether it remains special to this day. \n\nProbably the most well known aspect of the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is its use of meta elements. In order to stimulate the environment for extraordinary scenarios, as would be present in an anime, Haruhi searches for individuals who fit common anime archetypes.  There's a layer of irony to the fact that Haruhi formulates an anime scenario with high school cliche characters in order to pursue being the center of the universe, unknowing that she is indeed the center of the universe, in an anime consisting of high school cliche characters. However, aside from this irony, the series  doesn't play with this meta element much further. If said cliche characters were more fleshed out outside of their cliches and the series were to  better explore how these characters play their role for Haruhi while acting as individuals outside of those roles, this would further complement this irony. But the series does utilize meta effectively in an alternative way. From the parallels of the characters with their roles in haruhi's in-series movie and Koizumi's implication that he, Mikuru, and Nagato were assembled into the brigade through Haruhi's subconscious will, it's reasonable to assume that each of the characters that surround Haruhi within the brigade fulfill a role that satiates her desires. Her use of Mikuru as a plaything fulfills her desire for control. Nagato serves as an observer with no agency, whom Haruhi deems as an accessory to whatever goals or plans she may have (more relevant during endless eight in the second season and in the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya). Koizumi is the yes-man who never restrains her desires and fulfills whatever activities she asks of him. But this leaves Kyon, the only normal member of the brigade. By being normal, i.e. human, he fulfills the role as the one who's truly human to Haruhi. Kyon is the one opposition to Haruhi's escapism, the only character who can influence her decisions. As her one connection to humanity, only Kyon can awaken Haruhi from her desires to escape reality into her own world. This meta aspect of Kyon being the human who's truly human to Haruhi, is the strongest way in which meta is utilized.\nEven more central than the meta elements, the series is a look into the character arc of the titular Haruhi Suzumiya.  Her eccentricities, bouts of growth, and internal conflicts help put her above the average lead female character. From her introduction, she's portrayed as dead serious, always striving for possibilities to break monotony. Her importance to  Kyon is illustrated visually when she literally brings color to Kyon's grey world of accepting the mundane. The show makes a point of how far Haruhi goes to escape monotony: she surveys her entire school daily to look out for interesting people,  joins every club in the pursuit of the abnormal, and accepts any propositions for a date in the hopes of coming across unusual people. As the title of the show suggests, Haruhi's melancholy is the driving force of her arc. She is lead to believe that her life is insignificant, and subsequently seeks the abnormal to fill her void. Although she childishly seeks escape from the realities of the mundane, she herself is conflicted and almost convinced that the abnormality she seeks is unattainable. She carries through with eccentiricies such as her different hairstyles out of a desire for attention; above all else, she wants someone to aprpeciate who she is, but everyone looks at her with only dismissal.  Only when Kyon has a genuine conversation with her, asking her about her hair changes, does Haruhi get the attention she deserves. Her rashness is demonstrated when the day after being noticed for her hair ritual, she stops, no longer needing it as a means of attention. Kyon becomes the one person who appreciates and attempts to understand her, and thus becomes the one normal individual that she values, the human who is truly human to her. Although her drive towards action is already apparent through her joining of every club, there's no enthusiasm to her motivations until Kyon forms a connection with her. For the rest of the show, her joy and passion in seeking the extraordinary or engaging in some sort of activity is near-ever present. Kyon's influences grant her the motivation to create the SOS brigade, enabling her to create meaning in her world. Of course, she returns to a state of melancholy, when the brigade and her searches for the abnormal fail to give her what she truly needs. Ultimately, Haruhi cannot escape her own impulses. Although she claims that love is unnecessary, she herself admits that she cannot escape such desires. As such, she cannot control herself when she sees Mikuru being close with Kyon. This jealousy alongside her melancholic state prompts her to completely escape from the real world by constructing a new reality. But her inclusion of Kyon signifies that she has yet to lose touch of her one connection to humanity, the one obstacle against her escapist desires. Although Haruhi fully accepts this new world, the kiss by Kyon prevents her from following through with her escapism.  What Haruhi needs rather than to escape into a false reality is someone who values her in her life, and through Kyon's involvement she is able to escape her metaphorical dream, which in meta fashion she perceives as a literal dream.\nWhile the melancholy episodes serve to highlight the importance of human connection as a solution to Haruhi's central conflict, the filler episodes demonstrate the bouts of growth Haruhi goes after the event, along with general fleshing out of her character through  different scenarios.  In the baseball episode, Haruhi's mutual smile towards Kyon at the end of the game and her and her agreeing to stop playing  because of Kyon's desires directly follows from the Melancholy episodes; her connection with Kyon is what she truly values and thus can give up the game.  In \"Remote Island Syndrome,\" her mannerisms towards the butlers, her genuine concern for the supposed murder, her insistence on even caring about Kyon's sister not being traumatized by said murder, and her distress when seeing an unconscious Kyon   demonstrate that she isn't wholly self-absorbed. Furthermore, Haruhi's reluctance to change in the cave demonstrates the effect of her relationship with Kyon. By contrast, she had no hesitation in the beginning of the show when she changed her clothes in front of the entire class. In \"The Day of Sagittarius,\" Haruhi is willing to even give herself up rather than Mikuru or Nagato for the stakes of the video game match as a result of Kyon's suggestion, further emphasizing the role Kyon plays in countering Haruhi's egoism. She is even accepting of allowing Nagato to associate with the computer club, which is a contrast to her prior negligence towards Nagato. Of all these episodes, \"Live Alive\" is the most important for presenting to core of how Haruhi seeks satisfaction. Given Haruhi's resolve to carry through with whatever tasks she pursues, she feels sympathy towards the members of ENOZ who are unable to play, a softer side to the more often imposing Haruhi. Most prevalent is her self-consciousness after the performance since being appreciated by others is foreign to her. Her resulting melancholy is resolved by her ambitions for the future: to form a band and make a sequel to the movie. This illustrates that the way Haruhi comes to terms with uncertainty is through engaging in ambition. Her enthusiasm for whatever she sets out to do and drive for action are the core of her character. \nDespite Haruhi's compelling character arc, her characterization has some faults. Primarily, her tendency to use Mikuru as her play-thing is too extreme. It comes off as a forced means to incorporate fan-service throughout the series, as illustrating Haruhi's desire for control doesn't need to go so far. Moments such as her willingness to spread lewd Mikuru pictures to increase the popularity of the Brigade website are neither integral to her characterization nor to the meta elements of the series. The logical conclusion of Haruhi's character arc is  to learn gradually to pay respects to the values of others as her relationships with her Brigade members grow. However,  \"Someday in the Rain,\" the final episode in the chronology, involves Haruhi offering Kyon an errand so that she would be unopposed in using Mikuru as her play-thing. Since this proceeds all her development, it signifies that there has been no progression in this front when such development would be natural by this point in time. Overall, Haruhi's characterization is never complete within the series. The ending of the melancholy episodes hint that the next step of Haruhi's arc is forging stronger connections with others and understanding the importance of others in her life. Aside from a few moments with Kyon, this isn't particularly furthered. \nThe rest of the cast serve the roles they play well enough, but aren't overall that fleshed out as characters. Kyon is the most notable in how his monologues grant him some personality. Nagato has a few moments of being akin to a human: her setting up the events of \"Mysterique Sign,\" her enjoyment during the game against the computer club, and her attempts at making a joke in \"Remote Island Syndrome\" by denying Haruhi access to the room with Kyon's sister because of semantics. Mikuru's reactions make sense, due to her lack of control over what her organization demands she do. Koizumi is most notable in the humorous banter that arises with Kyon. He also brings forth a myriad of ideas and theories out of his inherent pretentiousness. Kyon's reactions in response to this works well, but by noting various ideas that may or may not explain how the world truly works, it enables viewer interpretation based on little clues that support particular theories. Overall, the characters work well enough but more characterization would be desired.\nAnother strong suit of the series is its ability to maintain engagement throughout.  The episodes contain quite some variety, and the incorporation of sci-fi elements provide  flare to prevent dull high school moments. Absurdity through events such as Nagato's clash with Asakura add to the engagement while being sensible given what's been established about Haruhi's power and the data entity. Kyon's commentary on the cliche scenarios the brigade encounters, Haruhi's absurd ideas, or Koizumi's nonsensical claims are amusing and add a particular charm to the show. Although comedy isn't a strong focus, certain moments of comedy worked well. As an example, Kyon's line in the baseball episode, \"After all, the fate of the world rests on my pitching. The world sure isn't worth much these days,\" is humorous in how it puts himself down while noting on how easily the world could be at stake because of Haruhi.  Additionally, Koizumi's Adam and Eve joke in Melancholy Part 6 is complemented by the suggestive manner in which the camera cuts to Haruhi. Interactions between Kyon and Haruhi in a few cases lead to humor as well, such as Kyon's remark about pop idols when Haruhi strives to form a band in \"Live Alive.\" The introductory moments of most Melancholy episodes retain interest through Kyon's monologue and they end in cliffhangers that provide engagement for the next episode. For the filler episodes, the series does a good job at keeping them captivating, whether it be through experimental animation techniques, character interactions, or capturing the perfect mood for the subject matter.  \"Remote Island Syndrome\", for example, perfectly captures the stern atmosphere of an unfolding murder mystery.  The music variety in the show  captures the right atmosphere for upbeat, intense, and mysterious moments whenever needed. For its time, the visuals in the series are strong. The attention to detail with facial expressions when Haruhi sings \"God Knows\" is one of the show's highlights in terms of animation. As a sci-fi light novel series, info-dumping is to be expected. Thankfully, the show handles it well in most cases.  Nagato's revelation speech to Kyon was split between 2 episodes to provide breathing room. Mikuru's infodump moment was handled well with the use of clever cuts to the surrounding environment. Kyon's genius bonus lines (such as his remark about Freud or his Sissyphus allusion) and his bouts of exaggeration can give the viewer something to look out for throughout, some times reaching levels of humor. From all of these elements, the show manages to be a fun experience throughout, mostly consistent in quality.\nAiring order is a an important topic for Haruhi. Both broadcast and chronological order have one good episode ordering that the other lacks. Broadcast's usage of \"The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina\" as the first episode was an inventive way of showcasing the meta focus of the series while establishing the role Kyon, Koizumi, Nagato, and Mikuru all play in the series. Only Haruhi Suzumiya wasn't established, which works well with brodcast episode 2 almost solely focusing on Haruhi. This interesting approach to establishing the characters is missing from the chronological order. However, chronological order's placement of the baseball episode after \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya Part 6\" works well since Haruhi's mutual smile and willingness to give up on this particular ambition is a direct characterization follow-up. This is the only one of Haruhi's developments that loses context in boradcast order. The ending of both orders is appropraite to an extent, but they achieve something different. Broadcast provides a climax at the very end which is enhanced since the viewer has spent more time with the characters when it happens. Chronological order ends with \"Someday in the Rain,\" where almost nothing happens. Nevertheless, the episode works as a melancholic close-off by stressing mundanity after everything that has happened in the show. Broadcast is overall the superior watching order, as it spaces out the filler episodes throughout the main story to provide greater investment for the satisfying climax, but chronological order is still serviceable.  \nIf there's one central limitation with the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, it's that it is too ambitious in incorporating several focuses without being able to fully flesh them all out. The melancholic moments, Kyon's pointing out of absurd scenarios in interesting ways, and witty dialogue interactions between characters were all found scarcely throughout the show. Each of these had appeal, but one cannot point to several examples within the series where they were incorporated. Similarly, the series could have tried more compelling ways of using meta, rather than mostly for irony. The characters have room for more fleshing out, and as previously mentioned, Haruhi's character arc remains incomplete. Additional information regarding the factions of the time travellers, espers, and data entities would be well appreciated, some of this provided by the second season. There are moments of invisible trust mentioned between Kyon and Haruhi, but this could have been expanded on further than merely a few lines of implication in particular episodes.  Some moments such as Kyon's questioning of Nagato's intent in \"Mysterique Sign\" has no follow-up within the season itself, but is justifiable as it ties to the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. Although many of the things the series accomplished could be expanded on, it at the very least accomplished enough in its run-time.\n\nFinal Verdict: (Personal Rating— Decent-Good)\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya  is  a worthwhile anime to this very day. For a high school series, its awareness and playing with the setting's tropes alongside the sci-fi additions help it stand out from a fair share of titles. Haruhi Suzumiya's characterization remains relatively interesting to this day, through her many eccentricities and her solution to finding satisfaction in a world of insignificance.  Effort was made to ensure that each of the cliche scenarios the show played with remained engaging. And the variety it presents adds to the entertainment. There was certainly soul and passion put into the series. Although a fair share of more impressive works in anime that have come out since its release, what it accomplishes still places it well above the average anime.\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=18,   ["text"]="                          \n    **SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF SEASON ONE ONLY**\nWhile I consider myself a person with a very broad taste in anime who can watch and enjoy most genres of the medium, there is one genre that I've simply never been able to get into: the \"slice of life\"  genre. It simply has never been able to hold my attention for more then a few episodes. Most entries are simply a collection of repetitive humor with a generic and uninteresting plot topped off with archetypical characters that I've seen a thousand times before.  It was only after dozens of people assured me that \"The Melancholy of\n          \n        Haruhi Suzumiya\" would change my stance on the genre that I finally caved in and decided to watch it, and wow am I happy that I did.\nWatching the three installments of the Haruhi series (season 1, season 2, and \"The Disappearance of Harui Suzumiya\" movie) can only be described as a journey; an emotional roller-coaster complete with the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. But I'm getting ahead of myself; this review will focus only on the first season of the show which is, for the most part, a high.\nPlot: 8/10\nWhere do I even begin describing the plot of Haruhi? The show is about Kyon, a snarky/sarcastic high school student, who is cynical to the point that he refuses to believe in anything supernatural. But then, he meets a very, VERY eccentric girl named Haruhi Suzumiya, and the supernatural is the only thing that she IS interested in—aliens, time travelers, and espers among other things. When Haruhi laments about the lack of intriguing clubs around school, Kyon inspires Haruhi to form her own club. As a result, the SOS Brigade (Spreading excitement all Over the world with Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade) is formed; a club which specializes in all that is supernatural, and Kyon is dragged (literally) right into the middle of it.\nBased on that description, it's hard to see what's so special about Haruhi. What makes this anime's plot so different isn't just the content, it's how the content is presented. You see, there are two orders in which you can watch the episodes of this anime in: one is in the order that the show was aired in and the other is in chronological order. This, of course, means that watching this anime the way it was intended to be watched, broadcast order, is not chronological. The downside of watching Haruhi in this order is that you will likely get very confused. In fact, if you start from the VERY beginning, at episode 0, you will likely think that this anime is complete and utter garbage. There will be several references to episodes you haven't seen yet and certain plot events won't make sense. However, watching it in this order is better in my opinion because the character development and plot events are structured much, much more appropriately. The climax of the series actually comes at the end of the show, for one.\nWatching the series in chronological order means that the events of the show will make a lot more sense to you; you are less likely to be confused and you will always understand what is happening for the most part. The downside is that the plot structure will make no sense what-so-ever. The climax of the show will happen in the middle of the series and the character development will be sporadic.\nI would recommend watching the episodes in broadcast order, but it's entirely a matter of preference. You get more of a unique flair from the show if you watch it out of order and as it was intended to be watched; it's more fun.\nNow that the confusing format of the episodes is out of the way, let's talk about why Haruhi has such a unique plot. While it may not be apparent at first, season 1 lays the ground work for what eventually develops into  a masterfully written plot that is fun, emotionally investing, and unlike anything you've seen before by the end of \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\" movie, which concludes the series. While the plot eventually becomes something much more significant and meaningful, season 1 is something with a much lighter tone; it's just plain fun. The antics of the SOS Brigade hilarious, over the top, and just downright amusing at all times. I can't elaborate without spoilers, but Haruhi is a groundbreaking installment into the slice of life genre because it demonstrated that you don't have rely entirely on stereotypes and tropes; it's okay to come up with your own unique plot, it's okay to air your episodes out of order, it's okay to write characters that don't adhere to any stereotypes, but it's also okay to use characters that do adhere to stereotypes. I won't go into much detail about what is so different about Haruhi's plot for the sake of spoilers, but let's just say that it's impossible to not have fun with it.\nArt: 9/10\nHaruhi's first season was released almost a decade ago and it STILL looks like it could be airing today. Enough said.\nSound: 9/10\nI'm an enormous fan of the choice of music throughout the Haruhi series.  It's largely indescribable, but all you have to do is watch the first episode (as in part 1, not episode 0) to see what I mean. I creates an energetic, outstanding, and unparalleled tone that no other series has. And lets not forget the ED which became a cultural sensation and remains one to this very day. It was so popular that countless other anime have tried to copy it, but to no avail. A simply amazing overall use of sound.\nCharacters:7/10\nWhile the characters in Haruhi eventually become extremely strongly developed and distinctive by the end of the series, we really don't get to see much of that in season 1, hence the 7/10 rating. What we do get, however, is a heavy dose of a legendary and one-of-a-kind character; Haruhi Suzumiya.\nWhat can I say about Haruhi Suzumiya that hasn't already been said? I absolutely fell in love with her after about the first 10 minutes of episode 1(again, not episode 0), and that love only got stronger as the show went on! Haruhi is eccentric, but she is more then just that. She doesn't let anyone or anything stop her from having fun and enjoying her life. She couldn't care less what other people think of her, which is an admirable trait. But perhaps most enticingly, Haruhi is a very caring person on the inside. Again, we don't get to see much of this in season 1, but you will. Some people say that Haruhi can come across as annoying or arrogant, but I couldn't disagree more. She is just a bright, uplifting, and downright lovable character who really makes the entire show.\nHaruhi is not the only awesome character in the show though, because now I have to talk about the protagonist: Kyon. Kyon is incredibly sarcastic and cynical throughout the anime and his hilarious narrations add quite a bit of flavor to the show. His snarkiness and sense of humor make him a very unique and likeable character, and he only gets more likeable as the series goes on.\nThe rest of the SOS Brigade are intentionally designed to be stereotypes. Yuki Nagata is the quiet bookworm, Mikuru Asahina is the moe fanservice girl, and Itsuki Koisumi is just an average highschooler. At the risk of sounding like a broken record: all of these characters become extremely well developed later on, but we don't get to see that in season 1. For now, they are just cogs in the Haruhi Suzumiya machine. Of course, all of them are still comedic and fun to watch, but they are largely undeveloped at this point.\nOverall: 8/10\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a revolutionary milestone that changed what a slice of life comedy could be, but that doesn't explain why you should watch it. You should watch it because\na.) You will never see another show that is similar to it\nb.) You should get the chance to view Haruhi Suzumiya in all her glory\nc.) You will need to see it in order watch \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\"; one of the greatest anime films of all time\nSo, what are you waiting for? Watch it! Even if you don't like it, you will probably like the movie that follows it seeing as the series begins to go in a very different direction.\n        "},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="                          \n    I was really expecting a lot coming in to this show.  It was one of the most hyped shows around '04 - '05.  There was even people building a religion around the main character Haruhi Suzumiya.  However, as I got into it, the whole thing was a mess.\nSTORY: \nAs for the story it's really pretty horrible, not confusing, but not something that make you think either.  Pretty much the only thing that it makes you think of is whether they mislabeled the episode numbers.  I'm not sure why they made the episodes jumbled and not linear because it wasn't clever\n          \n        at all, it was confusing and a real turn off for anyone watching it. \nThe story is also pretty slow paced, for the amount of actual development in story, the 14 episodes they had could've been shortened to a short 3 episode OAV, or 4 if they want to include the first episode which is unrelated to the story at all.\nThis type of format I believe also introduced the world to the moeblob show.  \nART:\nThe animation was alright, it was average at times, and horrible sometimes.  It wasn't nearly as fluid as high budget disney shows and the character designs are not that great either, but it can do the trick.  I really hate the computer ink that they use now as it really gives the colors a dull look, but they created one of the most iconic color combination in animes.\nAlso the dancing in the opening also fathered those types of dance routines in the pening.\nSOUND:\nThe only thing I really enjoyed in this series is the sound.  It launched the career of the big forheaded Aya Hirano.  They had a pretty catchy song, op, ed and the song God Knows is pretty badass.  The only thing I hated regarding the sound was the super high, forced, tryin to hard to be cute voice of Mikuru.  Seriously, stop straining yourself.\nCHARACTER:\nNot really very much to say here as there is little to no character growth at all in the supporting cast.  The only growth we see is between the two main characters which is hindered by the non-linear storyline.  It also created the archetype characters for moe blob shows.\nENJOYMENT:\nI liked the sound, but not so much everything else.  My enjoyment is also hindered by the fact someone messed up the episode labeling on the studio side.\nOVERALL:\nOverall haruhi was a precursor to the shows we are getting now.  The moe blob shows in my opinion really has it's roots to the haruhi series.  It launched the career of Aya Hirano, this was the show that really got her out there.  I have to give credit for all haruhi has done for Aya hirano and moe lovers but it was also the killer of the anime industry.  Why are we getting shows like \nK-ON and Mayoi Neko? blame Haruhi.\n~PZ\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Note: As I watched all 28 episodes together, this will be a review of the show in its entirety, apart from the movie, which I have reviewed separately.\nOverview:\nAt first glance, \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\" may seem like your typical comedy anime about a mentally-challenged girl and her crazy antics, but in truth it is actually a very intriguing series that masterfully combines supernatural mystery with slice-of-life elements. It is definitely one of the funniest and most unique anime I have seen so far, even if it is far from perfect.\nStory (8.5/10):\nThe story opens with our narrator Kyon, a cynical, practical and ever-so sarcastic teenager\n          \n        who has just begun his first year in high school. Little does he realise, that's where his ordinary world is turned upside down when he meets the titular Haruhi Suzumiya, an eccentric (to put it VERY mildly) and anti-social teenage girl who has no interest in ordinary humans. What is she interested in, then? Aliens, time-travellers and espers. Yeah, as I said, 'eccentric' doesn't even begin to describe her. After about a month of her just sitting around being bored (and joining and leaving just about every club in the school), Kyon somehow manages to break the ice with her and have a real conversation with her. After a while, he indirectly gives her an idea to form a club called the SOS Brigade and gets pulled into it against his will.\nThe first three episodes serve as the introduction. This is probably one of the best introductions to a show I've ever seen. It perfectly sets up the tone, characters, setting, theme and what kind of direction it will take. Apart from Kyon, Haruhi recruits three members into the SOS Brigade, and these three are revealed to be the very things Haruhi is looking for i.e. one's an alien, one's a time-traveller and one's an esper. However, they only reveal this to Kyon, as they have been sent to observe Haruhi as they believe her to be an omnipotent entity with the ability to change reality. As if she wasn't odd enough already. However, Kyon is quite a realistic person as he outgrew the supernatural a while ago and so doesn't believe in anything he can't see. In other words, it takes actual proof and demonstration of their powers to convince him of the truth. \nDespite the brilliant introduction, the quality of the story can unfortunately be quite erratic at times. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great story, but some arcs tend to be better than others, and there is one particularly infamous arc that may put some viewers off altogether.\nAnimation (8.5/10):\n\"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\" looks very good. The humans are well-animated and there are some really impressive one-scene wonders. However, some of the animations can get quite repetitive at times, particularly the movements of certain characters. These aren't too noticeable most of the time but you can expect a few times where it's very obvious. Overall, the animation is great, but not amazing.\nSound & Dialogue (9.5/10):\nThe soundtrack is very unique. It really fits the mood of the series depending of what is going on at the time and considering the mood changes quite frequently, you can expect one of the most varied soundtracks you could find anywhere. Special mention has got to go to \"God knows...\" which was translated for the dub and plays during my favourite scene in the series. Unfortunately, the opening and ending themes aren't exactly noteworthy. The voice acting is also really good, with Crispin Freeman as our sarcastic narrator. It may come as a shock to fans of him in that here he sounds totally different and is voicing a teenager. Besides him, the main cast consists of Wendee Lee, Michelle Ruff, Johnny Yong Bosch and Stephanie Sheh, who lend their voices to Haruhi, Yuki, Itsuki and Mikuru, respectively. The dialogue is also very funny, with more than a few lines that will leave you laughing for a while. \nCharacters (9/10):\nAs I've mentioned before, the introduction does a great job at establishing the main characters. Within their first minute of screentime, we instantly know what kind of characters we're dealing with. Haruhi's very first line in the series is 'I'm not interested in ordinary people, but if any of you are aliens, time-travellers or espers, please come see me. That is all.', which is pretty much the basis of her entire character. Kyon's opening narration shows him as both a snarker and a realist, which he absolutely is. Yuki Nagato is introduced as answering 4 questions with 8 words and showing no emotion while doing it, which easily establishes her as the silent, stoic type, Mikuru Asahina is pulled into the club because Haruhi wants a moe character, and she is very moe, and Itsuki Koizumi is introduced as asking what kind of club they're in and, when Haruhi explains, he agrees, showing that he's a guy who doesn't seem bothered by anything.\nNot long after their introductions, Yuki, Mikuru and Itsuki reveal themselves (to Kyon) as an alien, time-traveller and esper respectively and later they show what they can all do. But honestly, I've only described the basics of these characters. In truth, the five of them are all so complicated that there are several different ways to interpret each one of them.\nHaruhi is definitely my favourite, which is saying a lot since she's locked out of the loop and knows nothing about the overall story. Her crazy club activities are always funny, but there's far more to her than a girl who harasses and blackmails people without ever suffering for it. Tell you what, if episode 5 doesn't change your opinion of her, episode 26 definitely will. The fact that we're basically exploring her mental state and what effects it's having on the world also helps. In truth, despite her eccentricities, she's actually a very relatable character. I mean, who among us can honestly say we didn't want something amazing to happen to us when we were younger? I know I can't. Kyon is also very relatable and a great narrator with his sarcasm, even if the fact that he always seems to have to be annoyed by something can get pretty tiring from time to time.\nMost of the supporting cast are just there for the most part, so the main characters are the ones who really shine. None of them are similar to each other in any way, or at least no way that's particularly noteworthy. Ultimately, I really enjoyed all of them.\nEnjoyment (9/10):\nI can safely say that I was both very intrigued and entertained throughout the entire series. Unfortunately, one arc really annoyed me and may put off some people. Apart from that arc, however, I really enjoyed the series and was left laughing very often.\nOverall:\n\"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\" is one of the most unique anime I have seen, taking the average setting of a slice-of-life series and touching it with the supernatural mystery genre. It might be hit-and-miss for some people and to really get the most out of it, you will have to watch the movie. Nevertheless, I would definitely say you should check this series out.\nScore:\n8.5+8.5+9.5+9+9=44.5/50=8.9/10\n        "},

It was that terrible. Everything up to episode 13 was mind blowingly good. It had everything I liked in anime, intrigue, mystery, sci fi, good story and characters.\nThen I got to the Endless Eight story arc ... if you could call it a story arc.\nIt was an eight episode arc which wasted about 2 hours of my life when I realized that it would be eight episodes long, hence the name Endless Eight. This is just gawd awful lazy story telling. They spent eight episodes\n          \n        repeating the same junk when they could have done something good like develop the characters more. You could just tell that the writer had nothing to write about so he did the same episode eight times when he could have got his point across with just a few.\nThe worst part was when I finally got to the end of the story arc, I thought something poignantly profound was going to happen to make it all worth it and it turns out to be something just ridiculously trivial. I got very mad and irritated, I could no longer find enjoyment in this anime and all the \"slice of life\" events of the characters.\nSeriously, don't bother with this one.\n"},

It comes across as a weirdly smart anime for its genre and aesthetic, revelling in subtleties, never trying too hard to please, travelling along at its own pace and being its own likeable self in a way which paints the creators as 'totally chill, cool people' in my mind.\nBut perhaps that's because 'Haruhi' never belonged in the 'moe-moe' genre it resembles at face value. I've heard 'parody' being used to describe the show but I'm actually more tempted\n          \n        to reach for the fancier 'deconstruction', although that makes it sound too serious, so perhaps Haruhi is more like 'deconstructive parody'?\nAt any rate, I wouldn't call Haruhi Suzumiya 'moe', and that's coming from someone who despises the concept of 'moe'. Big- and sparkly-eyed as they are, the fanservice in Haruhi is more in the vein of 80's and 90's anime - sort of innocent, and never gratuitous enough to be off-putting. This light touch applies to the rest of the show - it dabbles and dances between mundane and supernatural and absurd with admirable nonchalance and yet never allows itself to overindulge in the more explosive moments.\nBecause that isn't what Haruhi is about! At its core, underneath all those layers of quiet, self-reflexive wryness, 'melancholy' does seem to be what it's about. Or a very mild variety of melancholy, at least. Haruhi Suzumiya has a dissatisfation that's easily related to: she's bored and frustrated with the trappings of ordinary life, and wants adventure, except this isn't one of those fantasy shounen animes where that gets to happen - at least, not for her. The events that follow are Haruhi's efforts to ease that boredom, and her methodology is less than ideal, causing either extreme humiliation or long periods of the characters sitting around doing nothing, but at least she's trying.        \nI think I've made it clear how much respect and affection I have for this anime, so I won't reveal too much more or say things that don't need saying. The supporting characters - while rooted in parody - are prominent and vivid; the atmosphere created by the art and music is warm and dreamy. Above all, you know an anime has done something special when you begin to have muscle-memory for an SOS clubroom that doesn't exist."},

Some people extremely hates it.\n(Some little spoilers ahead)\n\"The God is among us\" wasn't such a new concept even for the season it got released (Bruce Almighty was 2 years old when TMoHS was airing for example). Not that it means we cannot get an interesting plot here. But this series took that concept and managed to make it extremely unbearable, illogical and boring somehow. Why? Well, let us ask some questions to the show itself:\n------\nRS: So what do we have here TMoHS?\nTMoHS: We are given a concept of the non self-aware \"God\" that can manipulate or destroy\n          \n        the world.\nRS: Non self-aware..? What do you mean by that?\nTMoHS: The God is actually a self-centered high school girl that has no consciousness of her mighty powers.\nRS: That's cool. Oh wait.. Self-centered? Can you describe her personality a bit more?\nTMoHS: She is basically a selfish total bitch that has no moralities and takes any step she can to achieve anything.\nRS: Literally, Holy fuck! That sounds like a total badass concept as a thriller or horror!\nTMoHS: Thriller?.. Horror? We are focused on comedy.\nRS: Comedy? I mean, we are speaking of a selfish deity here.. That sounds pretty much catastrophic and dark itself. I am just imagining this non self-awared God causing massive deaths over some school problems, then does apocalyptic damages to the world she lives in. After she realises her divine powers, her mind either gets some sense in it or maybe goes full postal to destroy the entire existence.\nTMoHS: Probably. We did mention that she already altered the world before. But this isn't our focus. So interpret that part however you want to...\nRS: Yeah i will, but here is the problem: you just scratched that important part somewhere in the story and throw it away as, \"yeah some deep stuff happened\"? Not even a framework or mention on what happened back then? That could be interesting to watch, idk..\nTMoHS: It is up to you to interpret it.\nRS: Okay anyways, interpretions has no importance with what you present in the first place. Go on, tell me what you did instead..\nTMoHS: Well you see, we have this type of deity character called Haruhi. She is bored with her school and classes. After some talk with Kyon on her class, she dedicates herself on a club to search for some supernatural cases like aliens, robots or timetravellers exc..\nRS: Alright.. So do they appear? A God wills it whatsoever..\nTMoHS: That is the interesting part! Yes they actually do. Two humanoid aliens and a one time traveller joins on her club.\nRS: Oh then she recognizes their existence.. Then all of them go on space and do some time travel and stuff?\nTMoHS: Not.. Really..\nRS: ? Huh?\nTMoHS: They pretty much spend their time around sanitizing her mentality on the club. But she isn't aware that two of them are humanoids and one of them is a time traveller.\nRS: Okay hold up.. Something is completely inaccurate here.. She is not awared of them? How? Why? A God willed to encounter oddities and create a club just for it; for some reason, they appear; but she is somehow not aware of them? What is the logic behind this?\nTMoHS: But she encountered them technically..\nRS: But in her mind she didn't..?\nTMoHS: Not like she didn't encounter anything else. What about the crime case..?\nRS: Not even really close..\nTMoHS: What about the disappearance of one of the students?\nRS: These are indeed unusual, but not really supernatural. Well, Haruhi and Kyon were been into the Haruhi's corruped world once and she was aware of it. Why not the other cases are not this direct? How her wills even work on this world? Is it only extremely direct when the case suits it?\nTMoHS: Uhhh..\nRS: And other important aspects you don't even point out..What would happen if any of them commited deicide or the God somehow died? What would happen if any of the characters put the embodyment of the deity into a coma? Even she has divine powers how much is she protected?.. Or is it impossible for her to be harmed from any of this because it is her fate? Do characters have no will to think about this or they are just really dumb? Why did she even created this world in the first place if she would be bored again?\nTMoHS: It is up to you to interpret it.\nRS: Come on now.. You put some huge consept like \"unaware God\" and don't even bother with filling these tiny details?\nTMoHS: Well i still made you think. Didn't i?\nRS: Okay okay.. I do enjoy to talk about this philosophical stuff even it is flawled in few points. I'll give you that TMoHS. But you told me you wanted to do a tiny different approach to it right?\nTMoHS: Right!\nRS: Okay tell me about other characters on.. this useless club a damn deity decided to built instead of something more interesting a deity could do.\nTMoHS: Reminder that she isn't aware of her powers...\nRS: This club doesn't even do anything in particular.. And not really understanding why a school would allow such ridiculousness. Teachers can put a stop to her weird bunnysuit thing but not this? The world herself created and her powers make absolute no sense.\nTMoHS: Sigh.. Okay, back to other characters; we have the male lead Kyon. He is the one who inspired Haruhi to create the club after the chit-chats they had. He can be snarky and sarcastic depending on situations.\nRS: Oh so he can effect that deity..\nTMoHS: Yeah.\nRS: I agree and disagree with you there.\nTMoHS: What do you mean?\nRS: Kyon is indeed probably the most effective and non linear character you have brought so far. But tell me, why didn't you make him more morally constructive? He could elevate Haruhi to be more sensible but why all he does is boosting her ego and has absolute no effect on her morality? Don't give me that \"It is his character\" thingy. It is not hard to understand that her morality is extremely crucial to keep the world in good pace. If he is not a total moron, he would most likely act according to that point.\nTMoHS: ...\nRS: But even that aside, Kyon is unfortunately even less influential or even less likeable character than others claim. His effects are only few sparks on Haruhi to trigger some events. He has no other impact at all. And his personality.. He is just the worst (Yes even than Haruhi). For instance, that blackmailing Haruhi did on the computer club.. Maybe Mikuru was aware that she were the God and there is nothing she could do to go against her.. Why.. Why did Kyon sway that incident with some poor \"Is this supposed to be comedy?\" line and pretend that it never happened? Either Kyon is just morally corrupted or he is just another puppet in Haruhi's big puppet show. Nonetheless, he sucked so bad..\nTMoHS: I guess you never liked Mikuru then..\nRS: She is just the embodyment of fanservice. Haruhi forcing her to dress stupid shit is just entirely unfunny on its own. I personally find her squeaky and crybaby voice annoying. And her timetravel conclusion.. Kinda makes sense but still, that was kinda bland to be honest here.\nTMoHS: What about Itsuki?\nRS: A puppet babling much more than it should. Why does he even bother with what he is doing at all? I don't make any sense of it. If he wanted to fight against \"Haruhi's stress\" or something, he could do the same as Kyon or maybe put some chillpills in her drink while she is not looking instead. That would be more logical.\nTMoHS: Uhhuuh..\nRS: His existence is pointless overall.\nTMoHS: Yuki?\nRS: Ｂｅｅｐ． Ｂｏｏｐ． Ｅｘｐｏｓｉｔｉｏｎ． Ｂｅｅｐ． Ｂｏｏｋｓ． Ｒｅａｄｉｎｇ ｓｅｑｕｅｎｃｅ ｉｎｉｔｉａｔｅｄ． Ｔｕｒｎ ｐａｇｅ． Ｔｕｒｎ ｐａｇｅ． Ｔｕｒｎ ｐａｇｅ．\nTMoHS: So you didn't like this show?\nRS: An annoying deity, her boring/irrational world and her useless puppets. I guess not a show for me. It gives some good stuff to discuss thou.\nTMoHS: What about the other aspects? The sound effects, musics or animation?\nRS: Now okay hands down, i quite like the soundtrack of this show. So many jazzy tunes here. \"itsumo no fuukei\" is definitely sounds like \"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head\" by Dj Thomas tho. Coincidental or not, it sounds awesome.\nIn artistic perspective the colors are blended well. Animation looks smooth in places.\nTMoHS: I keep my puppets clean!\nRS: Ahahahaha!\n------\nOverall: the concept feels like it has been directed with the most incompatible style, maybe its genre and characters just doesn't fit with each other at all (it doesn't even feel like the characters were decently crafted). In philosophical aspect, it has huge dents in it (still can spark a good discussion). In humorous aspect, it is just a total fail for me. Some might like, i just don't.\n        "},

Well, who cares about my life, let's just start this.\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an adaptation of the novel series by the same name, well... not really the same name. The series is tited 'Haruhi Suzumiya Series' as each book has a different title. But, most light novel series will most likely be like that.\nAlthough, not everyone has the exact same opinion of a show/book/game. So, I cannot recommend the series to you... because I haven't even\n          \n        read it, I just know it's popular. Enough about the novel, let's actually start the review of this anime.\nThe story follows a weird woman named Suzumiya Haruhi, who believes in espers, ghosts, other weird supernatural shit. Then, suddenly, out of nowhere, those exact things come, there is now aliens and espers and shit in her school. Really, this first season of it? Not that great. First season is not that great and I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who was just looking for a short series. If they were looking to watch more than just the first season, I'd probably recommend it.\nThe art style to the anime is pretty good, and there is nothing else to say about the art style. It isn't eyecandy, it's just normal. Okay? OKAY!?!?!\nMusic that plays in background, never really paid any attention to it. Was I supposed to? I'm not sure. Opening/ending were pretty good, so, yeah.\nWell, I have a lot of mixed opinions about the characters, so do everyone else. Let me say this; one half of this site hates Suzumiya Haruhi; the other half loves her. I'm probably in the middle of that. I don't hate her but I don't love her. Yuki Nagato is best grill. I'm not going to explain every character, nor any. They're pretty decent.\nOverall, I'd give the anime a 7/10. There is nothing more to really say than that I'm giving it a 7/10, this season is not that great, but I'll still stick around til' more stuff comes out.\nThis review has been edited of 1/13/2016.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="                          \n    I just finished this infamous series and I'm still trying to figure out what's so great about it. Oh don't get me wrong, it's a good series; I just don't understand the status that it's been elevated to. \nPersonally, I compare it to Kanon (2006 version). They're so similar in numerous ways, but I'll leave that comparison for the recommendations section. The point is, I feel that Kanon is a muuuuch better series but it doesn't have nearly as many followers as Haruhi. I just don't get the obsession. I have seen mobs of people at cons doing the ED dance. I don't get it.\n          \n        *shrugs*\nBefore I watched the series I heard that there was a specific order to watch it in. I've seen SEVERAL DIFFERENT order lists, leading me to believe that fans are just out to mess with newbies. I watched it in chronological order and wasn't disappointed or confused. Sure, there is one ep that is CLEARLY the last episode, but it's not going to ruin the series to watch it in the middle as it was intended. \nSTORY\nI feel that shows like this and Kanon, Air, and Clannad could have taken place in the same town. Strange and subtle magic, bored and hilarious male leads, and moe moe characters. I swear I've seen this story before but it was probably another series parodying Haruhi. Well, in any case, the story is very original and has a lot of possibilities for a drama but instead is a light, fun, comedy. It's only a baker's dozen of episodes, so it will leave you wanting more. \nART\nBeautiful, of course. Very smooth and detailed. I love those big glowing eyes! And they don't shirk on character movements or repetitive frames, which is really nice. The characters are all very expressive (er, most of them) and it's a lot of fun to watch.\nSOUND\nThe music is a lot of fun and the opening is very cute. But the English voice actors? Ugh. WHY. WHY is Crispin Freeman Kyon? It doesn't fit the character at all! I half expected Kyon to flip out at some point and turn into a crazed vampire. After all, Haruhi would probably love that. Johnny Yong Bosch does a great job (as always) as the \"dissonant serenity\" character, Kyoichi. But then there's Mikuru who, like ALL moe characters, gets a whispery voice actress that is trying desperately to sound like she's 10. Haruhi's voice actress fit the part just fine, although I thought the voice tended to grate on my nerves.\nCHARACTER\nThe show centers around Haruhi, but it's really about Kyon and the other SOS members. I was having a hard time listening to Kyon's narration because at times you can't tell if he's thinking or speaking out loud, which is actually addressed somewhat tongue in cheek in a late episode. I think a lot more could have been done with the characters considering all the novels that are out there, but from what I understand there's a sequel coming out? So it's cool.\nENJOYMENT\nI watched this every night until my eyes wouldn't stay open. It's very hard to shut off and very enjoyable. Highly recommended! It's a light, fun series.\n"},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="                          \n    Before I begin I apologise to all women I know irl who watch animes, because they all love this one... And I hate it. \nWell \"hate\" might  be a strong word but I dislike this. WHy? Well because of the person the anime is named after. The whole story revolves around how our heroine, Haruhi, has god-like power that affect reality without her knowing. If she does understand she has god-like powers the shock could affect the world our male lead, the blunt-and-forgettable Kyon lives in. Haruhi, with her powers but without her consent, has created 3 people who represent her dreams... A timetraveller,\n          \n        an esper and an alien. Despite that sounding remotely exciting all of them appear way too human like and in fact with the exception of the alien (aka a cute and adorable emotionless loli) the other 2 are also blunt and forgettable. All of them join Haruhi's occult club in order to keep an eye on her so that she won't destroy the world, by keeping her in blissful ignorance.\nTechnically the anime is about what you would expect from a 2006 series, with voice acting that actually doesn't fit as well as most people think. I'm talking about Hirano Aya as Haruhi, the female lead. I'm not sure why but I get the feeling that she didn't put nearly as much effort as she did in Fairy Tail (I'm actually kinda thankful for that). Then again, perhaps it just isn't in her character to act stupid 24/7.\nFor the psychological analysis part, I can understand why almost every woman that watched the show actually liked Haruhi. Haruhi has mystical super duper powers (powerful person tag checked), but doesn't know she has them and therefore doesn't have any responsibilities (princess but not queen title, check). The fact that she doesn't know she has those powers also creates the faint hope that perhaps the female viewer watching this might also have hidden secret powers (hopes for the viewer, check). Because everyone else knows she has those powers they meet her every whim (leadership + constant company, check). Also finally, there is considerate and serious male lead who loves her for what she is and will constantly support her instead of consider her a freak of nature (love dream covered, check). So this is propably because I'm male but... I hate that f£$%ing bitch. \nPerhaps my being an SS class lolicon affects my judgment, but Nagato on the other hand (the alien) is extremely likeable. The writers seem to have realised it too, and whereas the first season centered around Haruhi, the second season offered equal screen-time to Nagato, with the movie actually being almost 100% devoted to her. When I did share my opinion that she fit way more as a protagonist than Haruhi I got the same answer from three different women: Nonsense! (no further explanation provided of course). That is also understandable. Whereas Haruhi is the woman every young girl would like to be (see my subtle diplomatic move here?), aka everything taken care for her but still powerful and feared, Nagato is exactly the opposite. She never stands out or object to anyone, takes care of EVERYONE'S problems, tries to keep with Haruhi's stupid whims, usually single-handedly saves the world from certain damnation by sacrificing her own mental stability and she never utters a complaint or even asks for help. Especially in the \"endless 8\" episodes (season 2, you'll understand if you see them) even the most heartless, cruel bastard will come to feel for her. But of course, she's exactly in the position no young, energetic, happy girl would ever want to be.  \nTo sum up the series... If you're male you'll propably come to realise sooner or later that the protagonist deserves decapitation with the mortal kombat announcer shouting \"Fatality!\". (Hell, first Isshukan friends, then Boku wa tomodachi bla bla, then Zexal, how come all the series I review lately have 100% unlikeable protagonists?)\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="                          \n    The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya:\nMINDSET:\n(abbreviated as TMOHS) this was the first show when the appeal of blu-rays on anime started to exist, and fortunately, it was far from bad. Consequently, “almost” every Slice Of Life became Slice Of Sh*t after it; as if I do not care about that, since anime is going to have a grim future anyways.\nSYNOPSIS:\nKyon whose more than an ordinary guy than generic, was about to enter junior high, and he did, only difference was the girl who sat next to him was a crazy b*tch called Haruhi. Due to the two talking quite often, Haruhi figured something out: A random\n          \n        activities club known as “The SOS Brigade” there, Kyon and a bunch of other random people, which Kyon founded out to be some part of a sci-fi organisation, were all gathered here for a one purpose: The truth is, Haruhi is God of the universe. Keeping her unstable or bored can get her Omnipotence to go haywire, and will effectively destroy the world. So the whole anime centres around the group, keeping Haruhi from being so negative, in order to prevent rapture...\nREVIEW:\nI believe the show is far, far from “deep” or “philosophical” since the biggest strength of this show is the self-aware and energetic nature that strays away from the calm yet cute moe or just plain boring Slice Of Life shows. It does feel like the writers were trying to amplify the crazy levels to make high school life anime not so boring. Obvious Fact. If the show was trying to to be something like that, where talking about how similar it confronts the themes like how NHK deals with the dark side of otaku culture, or those old Gainax shows presenting the negative effects of escapism. Something that is elusive at our time.\nWhen do I remember the show trying to make me think? The closest thing to that were moments when the show tries to be plot heavy or have mystery elements. One moment Koizumi, one of the club members, were at a taxi with Kyon as he explain how Haruhi could go out of hand and describes on how he is working with the mysterious syndicate. The two elevate up to the top of building, he then conveys himself with Kyon to another dimension with an alien-like titan. He sends out his esper friends, and kills it, or the baseball game when Kyon has to win this game or Haruhi's negativity will create the apocalypse. \nEven is it was serious, it does seem far from philosophical and has the show tried to raise tension, mystery, suspense and themes to think for? No.\nThe persona’s further emphasised this, that the show is just some crazy high school fun. The cast are far from 3-Dimensional, or just don't feel any closer from real people. Characters like Nagato or Mikuru are used in effect that the show was more happy fantasy with Nagato having the one dimension of a rock with all the otaku's drooling over fan fics on what if she had a personality, and even Mikuru, a flipping moe girl whose kind of shy and has big boobs.\nThe mightiest strength of this show, is the overall self-awareness: TMOHS aimed for an Otaku demographic, and it doesn’t fail at all. Haruhi may not be a person you'd like to be with, but has there been a point when you imagined some sort of fan fiction of her? Even if You didn't, the show is basically just one big escapism route for real life, yes the story is confusing and the second season tried to be serious, but ends up being sh*t. Yet the weird  sci-fi elements adds to eh show with how Kyon lives life with time travelers, psycho-computers and the hidden Syndicate which was never ever explained, and it did felt like a subtle reference from the old image of the Otaku, being a sci-fi fan and all.\nKyon is viewed as this parody of the generic protagonist, he does have the kind hearted traits of almost any vanilla guy, yet he never wanted to join the club and all what he wanted was to repel away from the hell he lived in, because Haruhi. He kind of develops-ish with with increasing his value of some members of the club, but at the end of the day, he was just portrayed as some ordinaty guy who just gotten his life in a mess. However, his personality never needed a back story and enough exposition was given right at the first few minutes of the show. Mix the chemistry of Haruhi's insanity, and the two contradict each other. Though it seemed to be a weird choice for a protagonist at first, it still fits with the whole parody of a calm slice of life and why not parody the vanilla guy back?\nSpeaking of Haruhi, she flipping embodies the show, period. Her bombastic nature coupled with unpredictable moments like using Mikuru as a sex object to black mail the computer club was down right hilarious! It was like intentional thought from the writers to make others fantasise about her motives, and a fair explanation on “how the hell is she crazy?” was never given. Though it doesn't affect t he show too much, in fact, no one excluding Kyon was ever given a back story, or even develop at that matter.\nComing back at how the show can be very “plot”. How they use those mysteries and tension and jazz, never built up to anything, which effectively removes the self-awareness. Contradictory, it doesn't happen often an can sometimes be used upon greater effect, like finding out one of the cute school girls was yandere computer obsessed on killing Kyon for twisted reasons, but that scene fits with the bizarre nature of the show because the show is meant to be crazy any ways.\nKyoto Animation were known as the masters of the moe craft, the character designs clearly had effort put into, and everything just seems to fit so well. With Kyon's calm look, or Haruhi's facial expressions and poses. Clear effort was put in, and Kyo Ani deserves the recognition it gets. I also liked the lack of chibi, which meant the entertaining writing for this show did not have cheap laughs! It had effort put in to carefully wove each joke, or just overall woeful moment nicely. It's artificial-like look adds further emphasis as a show really made for escapism, and I feel very glad that CGI models are barely ever used in the show. The lighting makes everything look shiny, but far from the insane Ufotable style which even makes oak wood tables plastic, but its subtlety is nice. It all looks sleek and smooth with the frame rates, and not once when the budget ever felt quite cheap, and these days, a budget like this is rather steep compared to most Slice of Life shows these days.\nThe OST is above average for the most part, and for an OST that lasts for a whopping hour, shows how much effort was put into it. Simply put, it fits the themes quite nicely, however, like the animation it does have a just as great budget. It fits the mood quite nicely, but does something to really implement those emotions, to something like a cool mystery. It has a surprisingly large amount of differing sounds in the background, with techno beats, drum rolls, electric guitars to make a gritty sound and even has 16-bit music to a certain degree! There are even songs only used once in the show, like that massive insect scene with Koizumi throwing a missive fireball at it and jazz. Its a highly versatile OST, and its super effective.... Though it does seem like one of the OST's that has quantity over quality, but something like the first one You hear in the first minute of the show, is memorable. The OP is also cool, yet I would argue if its even skip worthy since you may brush it of like me, or actually liked it.\nLEGACY:\nIt still lived up back then, and still lived up today with its high reputation. Will it still be remembered in the future? Maybe... It's overall a damn good show for its high budget, and doing something that Slice Of Life shows don't do often nowadays, and that’s just being “FUN.”\nCRITICAL SOCRE:\nStory: 7/10 – Slice Of Life being done in an energised fashion.\nCharacters: 6.5/10 – Fits the whole “Fun” theme.\nAnimation:7/10 – High budget\nSound: 7/10 – Highly versatile.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="                          \n    NOTE: This is a review of both Season 1 and Season 2 of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.\nINTRO\nWhen I look for a new anime to watch, it can feel a tad overwhelming. So whenever I get stuck and I don’t feel like picking one at complete random, I’ll just take a look and see what’s popular. Doing this led me to The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, a slice of life comedy anime that everyone out there seems to love. So I made the decision to check it out. But the real question is, was it any good?\nTHE SETUP\nThe main character for The Melancholy of Haruhi\n          \n        Suzumiya is Kyon, your average everyday highschool student. Kyon is enjoying a normal life, until one day he gets put in the same class as Haruhi Suzumiya. He doesn’t know what to think of Haruhi, until she proclaims in the middle of class that she’s looking for any time travelers, espers, or aliens. This has Kyon labeling her as a Class-A weirdo. Haruhi then decides to start up her own school club after trying all of the other clubs that the school has to offer and she ends up dragging Kyon along for the ride. Haruhi ends up creating the Spreading Excitement all Over the World with Suzumiya Haruhi Brigade, or SOS Brigade for short. To Kyon’s surprise; the other three members of the club are an alien, esper, and time traveler. As it turns out these three were sent by their respective organizations to watch over Haruhi. This is because apparently Haruhi is god. Yes this overactive highschool girl is the creator of everything as we know it, and she isn’t even aware of her powers. And if Haruhi gets bored or realizes that she is god, she might accidently destroy the entire universe. So it’s up to the SOS Brigade to make sure Haruhi is kept entertained while keeping that fact that she is god hidden.   \nTHE GOOD\nA likeable cast – One of the things that is essential to a slice of life comedy, are the characters. They are essential for carrying the show along and making it entertaining. Luckily the cast in this anime is fantastic. Kyon is very sarcastic and cynical but he is also the narrator for our story. His commentary over the events of the anime helps make it incredibly enjoyable. Hearing his opinions and viewpoint over the story is one of the things that made this anime a joy to watch. Kyon is an everyday guy and the sense of rationality in this irrational group of people. This helps make him a relatable character for the audience watching, as many of us would think along the lines with him if we saw all of these supernatural elements. He actually ended up being one of my favorite lead characters in anime. \nMikuru Asahina is the name of our time traveler. She is your typical large breasted, innocent, moe character who even has a variety of cosplay suits that were provided by Haruhi herself. Yuki Nagato is the cyborg alien and she comes off as being and emotionless always aloof character who but she is also an intelligent, very powerful, and a complete badass. And finally Itsuki Koizumi is the mysterious transfer student who is our esper and he also comes off as one of the most passive aggressive dicks that I’ve seen in anime.\nThe final character is Miss ADHD herself, Haruhi Suzumiya. Haruhi comes off as funny, eccentric, and even somewhat unpredictable. With a burning desire to find the phenomena in the world, she is generally unapproachable and finds ordinary people boring and uninteresting. She can be very spontaneous, upbeat, and hyperactive. Her determination, persistence, and resourcefulness drive her endeavors of finding strange phenomenon and promoting the SOS Brigade. Because of her dedication, she becomes hot-headed when things don't go her way. Hand-in-hand with her cleverness and creativity, and a certain ruthlessness, even seeming amorality, she can often get what she wants, an example of such is when she blackmailed the President of the Computer Club into giving her a brand new computer for the SOS Brigade. Kyon is actually the only person who can put up with Haruhi’s personality which gets him caught up in her plans to make a club. \nHaruhi’s antics and her desire to see new and interesting stuff can lead our characters through many types of stories.  Whether it be wanting to win a baseball game, to playing in a band, to even solving a murder mystery. The characters help set up these interesting plot lines throughout the show and help bring life, and to an extent, the enjoyment that the series has to offer.\nA Dub Done Right – One of the things that I’m normally skeptical about when entering an anime is if the English dub is any good, well I can safely say that it was done incredibly well here. We have great performances from Wendee Lee, Michelle Ruff, and Johnny Yong Bosch, but special mention needs to go to Crispin Freeman for playing the role of Kyon. He is able to fit Kyon’s snark and cynical personality incredibly well. And since he is our narrator throughout the entirety of the anime, it was important for his voice to be good. Well it’s a good thing that it is and Crispin’s role as Kyon is the main reason why I would recommend the Dub over the Sub.\nBeautiful Animation – The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was animated by the studio Kyoto Animation. They’re normally well known for their beautiful animation and production values that they put in their shows. Haruhi is no exception. The anime contains Kyotoani’s signature cute-ish style combine with animation that is consistently fluid and packed with color. One of the best examples of the great animation in the series is actually the ending for the first season where all of the members of the SOS Brigade perform a choreographed dance. It was extremely weird when I first watched and it stands as one of my favorite parts of each episode. \nTHE MIXED\nViewing Order – One of the interesting things about Haruhi is how it was originally released. You see it’s because when it was airing in Japan, it was shown out of order. And to make matters even more confusing when season two aired it was aired in the middle of a rebroadcasting of the first season. So some people are confused about which order to watch it in. Well no need to fear because there is a chronological order that you can watch the series in in order for you to not get confused while watching it. Although it is a bit of a strange experience if you try to watch it in release order.\nTHE BAD\nEndless Eight – Okay, so anyone who has watched the series knows what I’m about to talk about. But for the uninformed, Endless Eight is a story arc in season 2 in The Melancholy of Hauhi Suzumiya. This story arc is eight episodes long, and each episode is exactly the same, with small differences. That’s right, the story events, scenes, and even character dialogue are all nearly identical to the episode before it. In fact you could watch the first, second, and eighth episodes while skipping the rest of them and not miss anything at all. Endless Eight was one of the most boring story arcs that I’ve seen in anime. This story arc could have been easily cut down to four or five episodes and it would have been perfect. Now don’t get me wrong I did think that it was one of the most well directed arcs in the entire series, it’s just that sitting through the entire thing was a chore and I don’t think I will be doing it again anytime soon.\nFINAL VERDICT\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was an incredibly fun series to watch. The characters were some of the most entertaining that I’ve seen in anime. Kyon was hands down the perfect narrator for the story giving his sarcastic thoughts and opinions for the events that were transpiring. The dub was extremely well done as was the animation. Watching the anime can get confusing depending on what order you choose to watch it in. Unfortunately the Endless Eight arc brings down the quality of the story a bit. Despite this though, Haruhi still stands as a really great show that displays what anime can and will be, creative stories and characters that you just don’t see in other forms of media. If you’re an anime fan and haven’t seen the series, I give a full recommendation for you to check it out. It became one of my favorites; it might become one of yours too.\nSeason 1 Final Score: 4.5\nSeason 2 Final Score: 4.0\nVideo Version: http://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=MsZ_adeHG7I\n        "},
		{["score"]=2,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="                          \n    I raise my glass for The Overated Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, otherwise known as the show with wasted potential. Dive into this review at your own discretion, as it may contain minor spoilers, but then again, there isn't anything you can say about this anime that would remain completely spoiler free. I've only seen the anime, so this review is solely based on this work. It's also based on the chronological viewing.\n\nScene: The conception of the Melancholy anime, as I imagined it in all it's inaccuracy.\nTwo executives sit at a round, wooden table. There is a man standing before them, nervously wringing his hands. One\n          \n        of the seated men nods his head, a signal for the man to begin his presentation.\nCreator: W-well, I have this story, it's called \"Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu\"...\nMan 1: Go on.\nC: It's about this girl who has god powers and doesn't know it and the world revolves around h-\nMan 2: Sounds good so far, but how about we add a few characters.\nM1: Uh... book girl and fanservice girl.\nC: But-\nM2: Gotta have a mysterious transfer student.\nM1: Oh yes!\nC: Well-\nM1: Rational narrator! That'll work.\nM2: How could I have forgotten!\nC: So as the plot goes on, w-\nM2: NO!\nM1: ABSOLUTELY NOT!\nM2: We're sorry, plot alienates our viewers. Your plot was starting to sound a little too smart there. However, we like this series so much that we're even going to consult the dartboard for you, how does that sound?\nC: What is that?\nM1: Great to see we're on the same page.\n[Man 1 stands up and walks to the back of the room as Man 2 produces nine darts from his pocket. Man 1, with a flourish, removes a curtain from the wall that wasn't previously there, unveiling a simple dartboard with little pieces of paper taped to it unfasionably.\nM1 sits back down and M2 closes his eyes, dart in hand. Man 2 begins to hurl darts at the board as Man 1 reads the choices aloud.]\nM1: Baseball! Classic. Bug episode? That's odd. Video game! Heater! We'll find some way to make that work, I guess. School Festival, how fun! Beach/Murder story, think of the lovely fanservice! Woah, it got hit twice, we can have TWO of those episodes! Film! Kiss! Looks like we've got some winners here.\nM2: [Looks to creator] What'dya think about that! Isn't our way of choosing episodes spectacular?\nC: W-well, actually I-\nM2: Great! Let's start production!\nStory:\nSo much potential, so frustratingly ignored. We have a concept that could go far, the concept of a god who doesn't know that she is a god, who can manipulate everything while still knowing nothing, and the world must bend to her selfish teenage wishes. In the first few episodes you have the promise of a great series. But once the climax comes, all you're left with is filler crap that they tie haphazardly to the plot. If you're looking for an anime about a wacky school club with an eccentric leader and minor filler watch Angel Beats instead, it'll at least make you laugh.\nArt:\nIt's a slice of life, I don't really expect the animation to be fantastic. The famous ending is great, the motions are fluid, the opening's alright. But then... the CGI. DAMN IT. I had to deduct quite a few points for the horrible, clunky, distracting, hideous 3D animation. The character designs are pretty generic. If you were to dress one of the three tacked on club members who's names to me are \"boobs, transfer kid, and gray haired book chick\" in something other than their uniform and put them in a crowd of other anime characters I wouldn't recognize them.\nSound:\nUUUUUUGH. Koizumi's voice makes me wince. His voice has a real sharp feel to it at times. It's like a dog whistle, only annoying to those who notice it, so don't let that nitpick throw you off. The other seiyuu were standard, nothing that special, except for Haruhi's. She captured the slightly crazed personality of Haruhi to a T and brought new personality to the character.\nCharacters:\nHaruhi is interesting. Kyon is kind of interesting. The others barely exist. The club members are simple archetypes, and they could've been great if they didn't have the personality of yellow crabgrass.\nEnjoyment:\nAt first, I was at the edge of my seat. Next, I was laying down. Then, I was on the floor sobbing and wondering why I was still watching this. After finishing the anime, I closed my laptop and penciled in my next exciting plans to watch paint dry.\nOverall:\nWatch this anime and see how you like it. You may love it or you may hate it. I hated it. It's up to you to decide.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    NOTE: This review is based on the 2006 airing of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Do not confuse this with the 2009 Rebroadcasting of Season 1 that was aired with new episode thrown in\n\nCritic’s Log - Earthdate: February 14, 2014. Review #78: The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (2006)\nBefore I begin, there is something I would like to say even though this is somewhat completely pointless to this review. While I was first writing this review, I heard some news. On January 23, 2014. Justin Carmical (known to many as JewWario) committed suicide. Justin Carmical was known on YouTube for doing Let’s Plays on Japanese\n          \n        imported games. I read other sources and found that he collects manga and does enjoy some old-school anime. I don’t know what led Mr. Carmical to commit suicide but all I can do is send my condolences to his family, friends, and his fans. This is the least I can do.\n\nR.I.P.\nJustin Carmical (JewWario)\n1971-2014\n\nChanging subject, It is February and widely considered to be the Month of Love. I honestly can’t relate to that at this time since I am actually single. If I look at a certain point of view that involves either my family or my faith. I guess I don’t have a problem with it. If we are talking about Valentine’s Day, I guess I could celebrate somehow. Come to think of it, what does Valentine’s Day have anything to do with The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya? Nothing.\nOn the first day of high school, a beautiful girl named Haruhi Suzumiya introduces herself as having \"no interest in ordinary humans\". She asks for any aliens, time travelers, or espers to join her. Watching her weird behavior is Kyon who sits in front of Haruhi and is the only person who talks to her. When Kyon comments about Haruhi's joining every club in school and then quitting he unwittingly gives Haruhi an idea to start her own club. Thereafter Kyon and several others find themselves dragged, literally, into the Spreading excitement all Over the world with Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade (the S.O.S. Brigade for short). Wait, what?\nTo be technical, this is a Kyoto Animation production and they have had their fair share of popularity over the years before and since with popular animes such as Air, Clannad, Nichijou, and even K-On! The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is without a doubt their biggest hit. When it comes to slice of life anime, they sometimes get pretty animation but that’s pretty much it… With Haruhi Suzumiya, the animation was not put to waste. The animation is energetic, always moving most of the time and for 2006, the animation looked pretty damn good. It is also fun to look at as well. Kyoto Animation does not disappoint with Haruhi Suzumiya.\n\nThe music by Satoru Kousaki may not stand out to some outside of the anime but I believe it fits the show greatly. This might not be one of the most standing out soundtracks in Anime, but The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya does have some tunes that fit the show greatly and it stands out to fans of the series. If there is something I liked in the music department, it would be the use of classical music that was used in a couple of episodes. Gustav Mahler’s 8th Symphony was used in the show and it really made the scene it was used on quite awesome. That specific classical piece was not the only one, there was some other classical stuff used in the show, one on Tchaikovsky and one on Shostakovich. The classical music usage is the more interesting aspect of The Soundtrack of Haruhi Suzumiya. But the highlights of the music are the opening and closing themes. Bouken Desho Desho is a catchy opening that suits the show well and there's the famous closing that is catchy as hell \"Hare Hare Yukai\", it is one of the most popular closing themes in an anime and I think it is because it is so damn catchy. But the special music video version with the entire dance is a lot better than the visuals in the closing theme, but it's still a catchy theme. The music’s great and it fits the show greatly.\nIn regards to voice acting, the Japanese cast does have a great bunch. Aya Hirano is terrific as Haruhi and she makes Haruhi’s eccentric attitude all the more believable, Tomokazu Sugita is great as Kyon but I think he was a bit over-the-top. Yuko Goto is very likely known for playing Miss Asahina, *ahem* Mikuru Asahina. Minori Chihara (similar to Goto-san’s case) is very likely known for her role as Yuki Nagato. Daisuke Ono is terrific as Koizumi Itsuki. The extras are decent and they play their roles alright. As for the English Dub, Wendee Lee is an interesting choice for Haruhi. She actually is able to play a high school girl and not leave the performance sounding awkward. Over the years, Wendee Lee has proven that she is a talented voice actress, my only tick with her role as Haruhi is that it does lack a little eccentricity but only slightly. If there is a voice actor that does make the Dub worth listening, it would be Crispin Freeman as Kyon. Kyon has a certain personality that makes him not a stereotypical average high school student character, Sugita-san was a little over-the-top on this, but Crispin Freeman nails this little character trait of Kyon. Stephanie Sheh plays the shy Mikuru Asahina quite well and Michelle Ruff is great as Yuki Nagato. Johnny Yong Bosch is an interesting choice for Koizumi Itsuki and I don’t think the performance is bad, but I think Ono-san nailed Koizumi on this one. The extras in the dub are decent. It’s pretty much the same outcome with the Japanese cast. The extras play the roles alright.\nThe characters are going to be interesting to talk about… First and foremost, there is Haruhi Suzumiya. She gets the right to be the center of attention since she really makes the show fun...Haruhi really is a fun character. Surprisingly, Kyon is not as bland as you would think… He has his quirks that make him stand out. Time Lord Mikuru Asahina does have the cliched shy character archetype, but at least that is excused because of “classified information”. She sure knows not to give away “Spoilers” such as revealing to all who The Doctor’s name really is. Seriously, people… Miss Asahina should have her own TARDIS. She views Haruhi as a distortion in Space and Time.  Yuki Nagato is the bookish quiet one and that is kind of a cliched trope as well, but it makes sense since she is an alien…She views Haruhi as the potential for Evolution (uh…okay).. Then there’s Koizumi Itsuki… The Esper. He is quite talkative but at least he’s not that bad. He views Haruhi as a God. Uh… I think Koizumi should have said “Goddess” and am I the only one that's getting a little tired of the \"God\" jokes made towards this show? Characters like Tsuruya, Taniguchi, and Kunikida are great as supporting characters. Even Ryoko Asakura was alright for the screentime she got. If there is one flaw with the characters. It is that they are underdeveloped in some areas, but that was only until 14 more episodes were on the way after this “first season” was finished. The characters really do make the show a fun watch.\n\nWhich leads me to the show’s history… The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an adaptation of the Haruhi Suzumiya light novels series and for some odd reason, the broadcasting of Haruhi Suzumiya involved airing the episodes out of order. Here’s the rundown.\nIn the non-linear broadcasting order…\nThe “00” episode with the “Home Movie” starts the show off.\nthe first two parts of “Melancholy”\n“Boredom”\n“Melancholy” Part 3\nRemote Island Syndrome (Part 1)\nMysterique Sign\nRemote Island Syndrome (Part 2)\nSomeday in the Rain\n“Melancholy” Part 4\nDay of Sagittarius\nLive Alive\nThe Last two parts of “Melancholy”\nDid you get all that? That was exactly how it was broadcasted back in 2006. A Confusing way of airing the show, yet that “00” episode being aired first would make it clear that this was going to be that kind of show. It was the intended experience back then but lately… it’s a little different now. There is also the “Chronological” order that I believe most fans are accustomed to...and allow me to tell you what I thought of them since this season wasn’t long and yet I think it would be fun to talk about…\n\nThe six-part story arc “The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya” is the meat of the entire package, it has the whole story that you need to know about this show, and it may slow down at times, but there is a good reason for it. The Boredom of Haruhi Suzumiya is a fun episode if anyone likes sports, especially Baseball. Even if you’re not a sports fan, it’s still a fun one-shot episode. Mysterique Sign may be a speed bump in the series but I guess it was an ok episode. The two part episode “Remote Island Syndrome” is pretty much a “detective” episode but not terrible, there is some interesting visuals in that one as well as a pretty good parody of a video game. The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina Episode 00… Do I need to explain that one? Live Alive has a particularly impressive moment with Haruhi. The “God Knows” scene is great and was one of my favorite episodes, that was until “The Day of Sagittarius” came along. This episode was awesome. The Day of Sagittarius is noted for its homages to Space Opera animes such as Space Battleship Yamato (Star Blazers in the US), and even Mobile Suit Gundam. This episode also used classical pieces as well during the “game” scenes and this of course was paying homage to the Space Opera anime Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Most Americans wouldn’t know because it was never brought here. Another thing I liked about the Day of Sagittarius is that even though it was paying homage to these Space Opera animes, they didn’t insult those who liked them. Even if Gundam was censored up high in Space. Which brings me to the concluding episode “Someday in the Rain”... I fucking hate this episode. Think about it, 13 episodes of randomness, fun, and awesomeness led up to an episode that is none of that. It is the most boring episode of the whole bunch. It is disappointing because it is not a very fun episode at all… There isn’t much story, there is hardly any good laughs in it, and there is even 2 to 3 minutes wasted on Yuki reading a book. Yeah, it’s that bad. I don’t want to give too much away, but even if I did, you probably already heard how bad this episode was. Whether you want to watch this in Chronological order or out of order, Most of this anime is a lot of fun. The vibe that I get from this anime is that if you are currently in high school, this would be a great one to watch with fellow classmates after school. It is like a party and all guests are invited to this after school party.\n\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was available by Bandai Entertainment but since they went under, this anime is sadly out of print. I do hope it gets rescued someday. The light novels written by Nagaru Tanigawa and illustrated by Noizi Ito are available by Yen Press. A manga adaptation written by Nagaru Tanigawa and illustrated by Makoto Mizuno only lasted one volume and has not been released stateside. The manga series written by Nagaru Tanigawa and illustrated Gaku Tsugano is available by Yen Press. A spinoff manga called The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya is available by Yen Press. a second spinoff called Nyoron Churuya-san has not been released stateside. The anime web series adaptations of Haruhi-chan and Churuya-san were available from Bandai Entertainment and is out of print. Another manga spinoff called The Disappearance of Yuki-chan Nagato has not been released stateside as well as The Intrigue of Koizumi Itsuki. All the video games based on the series are only released in Japan.\nWith all that said, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an anime that is straight-up fun. The plot is whacky and fun, the animation is great for 2006, the characters are memorable despite developmental issues in certain areas, and the soundtrack is great for this science fantasy slice of comedy.\nI give The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya a 9 out of 10, it is EXCELLENT!\nFeel free to leave a comment and join the club!\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    \"There's something wrong with people who seek reality in fiction.\"\n--Kyon\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a landmark in anime history, notable for spawning dozens of imitators throughout the late 2000s after the series exploded in popularity. Its off-the-wall antics, garbled broadcast order, and memorable characters made it an icon of the anime world in 2006, and to this day its influence is still felt in the medium.\nSo does it stand up as a great anime in its own right ten years later? After conducting my own rewatch, I'm inclined to say yes. The characters are still as lovable and interesting now as they were back\n          \n        then. The scenes that cracked me up as a teenager ten years ago still get a chuckle out of me today as a grown man. The passage of time and refinement of the medium have not diminished the glory of Haruhi.\nStorywise, the show isn't really all that deep. It's a regular slice-of-life set in high school, although with a supernatural twist. Haruhi Suzumiya is basically a reality-warping deity who is not and cannot be allowed to be aware of her powers. She's not interested in anything regular schoolkids do, so she creates a club to look for every sci-fi cliche in the book: aliens, time travelers, and espers. And she's lucky enough to have one of each plop into her lap, unbeknownst to her, of course. Humor ensues, generally led by the deadpan observations of the resident normie, Kyon, and his mildly antagonistic relationship with the mercurial Miss Suzumiya.\nHaruhi herself is a character that has to be seen to be believed. She's bossy. She's arrogant. She has very few moral standards. What she wants, she gets, or she raises hell. You might think that such a character would be thoroughly unbearable to watch, but she manages to be absolutely adorable despite these traits. She's the engine that gets the events of the series going, and you know there's not likely to be a dull moment when she's around. I think to this day she's easily one of the most charismatic personages in anime history.\nThe rest of Haruhi's SOS brigade are a bit tropey: Yuki Nagato is a \"silent beauty\" as Haruhi calls her. Mikuru Asahina is rather lackwitted but possesses limitless moe power, bringing Kyon and the viewer to their knees with her smile and sincerity. Koizumi Itsuki is a perpetual Stepford smiler who is one of the more interesting characters. Although he gives out a ton of exposition throughout the show, he always seems like he knows more than he lets on.\nThis first season plays out like a collection of short stories about this ragtag group of supernatural entities, culminating in a couple emotional climaxes that put an exclamation point on the events. While you may believe you've seen a lot of these same ideas in play before, Melancholy was the prototype that originated the scores of clones that followed it. K-On! practically owes its entire existence to a single episode of this show.\nThe art for this is easily recognizable as the work of Kyoto Animation, and while some of their more recent efforts might have outdone Haruhi, they have by no means diminished its quality.\nThe sound design is also very well done. I've watched both subbed and dubbed versions, and am more than willing to stand up and say that the English localization is just as good as the series' mother tongue. The cavalcade of talent (Crispin Freeman, Wendee Lee, Johnny Yong Bosch, Stephanie Sheh, and Kari Wahlgren just to name a few!) put together tremendous performances that have won awards for their quality. If dubs aren't your thing, this might just be the exception. The music is all memorable, and I still get hyped at the OP. The ED, \"Hare Hare Yukai\", doesn't even need to be explained. The dance itself has transcended anime and become a pop culture icon.\nMelancholy is not without flaws. Its pacing is a bit inconsistent, and some of the gags are definitely cringey, or done to death over 14 brisk episodes. The series has lost some of its \"groundbreaking\" cred because of the legions of wannabes that now exist.\nAbove all, I can say that this is one of those shows that will always be a favorite of mine. That said, I can't really objectively review this because my memories of watching it ten years ago are still so vivid. But putting aside my personal feelings, I still think that Haruhi has withstood the test of time, and will continue to do so for many years to come.

I also happened to watch the series in a messed up hybrid broadcast/chronological order. Be warned. I give this anime a 6.)\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was alright, I guess. The art was pleasant to look at, and the music was good (especially the legendary first ED). Holds up well for a 2006/2009 anime. I give this anime a 6.\nThe story is built off the theme of the SOS Brigade trying to keep their leader Haruhi satisfied by doing what she wants (or else very bad things will happen). Every episode is\n          \n        a variation of this. She wants to do THIS wacky thing? Better do it. Now she wants to do THAT? Better do it! I give this anime a 6.\n In this way, this anime is kind of a slice of life anime following the high school exploits of one girl. Of course, there are other certain twists that make things interesting, but the story is very episodic. There is a sort of overarching plot in episodes I-VI, but that's it. I personally like evolving stories where the actions of each character matter as the show continues, but to each their own. I give this anime a 6.\nThe characters are certainly unique and likable in their own ways. You got Haruhi Suzumiya herself, who could be see as either super quirky and full of energy, or obnoxious and self-absorbed. Kyon is the sarcastic male narrator lead. Yuki is the emotionless monotone genius being. Mikuru is the fanservice helpless whiny girl. Koizumi is the other guy. The focus of the story is definitely on Kyon and Haruhi, though. Unfortunately, there's not enough depth to them for me to praise them as great characters. I give this anime a 6.\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya looks nice and has some really catchy songs, but its main plot device wears thin rather quickly and the randomness of the episode ordering can only do so much to keep things interesting. The characters are entertaining at first, but become predictable later. Don't even get me started on the Endless Eight. I give this anime a 6.\nWait... I feel like...

The music works, though I don't find it to be extraordinary. \nHaruhi Suzumiya is a cock tease of a show.

Kyon is more or less the saving grace of this show and his role as main character and snarky unreliable narrator really brings in most of the charm as does his obfuscating stupidity.

At least she has character and some depth, which is more than I can say for the rest of the cast.  All of which are one note and have absolutely no depth beyond their one note roles. \nThe dubbing in both languages is very good, all characters sound appropriate for their characters and turn in really good performances.  Special mentions have to go to Crispin Freeman, who absolutely steals the show in this series as Kyon.\nIn the end, its just an okay show.

Haruhi and the SOS Brigade have developed a devoted following (Haruhism!) since their anime debut back in 2006 and have since become household names among anime fans. And for good reason. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is unarguably a modern classic.\nThe premise is pretty far out there: Suzumiya Haruhi, an eccentric high school girl, drags the male lead, known only as Kyon, along with her as she forms\n          \n        the SOS Brigade, a club dedicated to finding unnatural phenomena and people, such as aliens, time travelers, and espers. Conveniently, the three other members who join the club are just that. The alien humanoid-interface, Nagato Yuki. The klutzy time traveler from the future, Asahina Mikuru. The esper, Koizumi Itsuki. One by one, each of them reveal their true identities to Kyon, and why they are there: they are each under orders from their superiors to observe Suzumiya Haruhi. While their viewpoints differ, they all agree that Haruhi possesses a unique power that can essentially manipulate reality--and Kyon is the only person that she is truly willing to listen to. However, Haruhi can never become aware of her own ability, lest the consequences be disastrous. Thus, Kyon must help them keep Haruhi happy while making sure she doesn't discover her own power.\nAs you're probably aware of by now, the episodes were aired in non-chronological order. I strongly encourage you to watch them in their original, non-chronological broadcast order. This provides a unique viewing experience that allows the viewer to piece together the events of the series, and watching elements of separate episodes come together is really a one-of-a-kind experience that makes the show exponentially more enjoyable. This was an excellent and very bold directorial decision that was (thankfully) executed impeccably. The original 2006 broadcast has a main story arc that is punctuated with closed-end episodes that provide further insights into the lives of the SOS Brigade members.\nWhich brings me to the characters. What can I say? They're excellent. In Haruhi we find one of the most dynamic anime characters ever put to screen. For a two-dimensional character, she practically leaps off the screen. Her boundless energy and enthusiasm makes her irresistibly likable, despite her being painfully frank and stubborn. \nAsahina's clumsiness and overall ineptitude makes you wonder if she really is qualified for the mission her time-traveling organization gave her. Although personally I view her as the weakest character, she consistently provides comic relief as the helpless victim of Haruhi's plots to exploit her good looks and serves her purpose well. \nAs an alien \"humanoid interface,\" Nagato possesses incredible amounts of power and knowledge, including amazing physical strength and the ability to alter the \"data\" of her environment. Despite hardly speaking and apparently having no discernible emotions, Nagato remains a standout character nonetheless. Various instances establish that although she may not show it, Nagato is closer to humans and is more attached to the members of the SOS Brigade than you might think.\nBetween Asahina, Nagato, and Koizumi, Koizumi is my personal favorite. Why? Because he is the most enigmatic. From beginning to end, Koizumi is the one we know the least about. He is a member of an unnamed organization of espers who wish to monitor Haruhi. His abilities are shown very sparingly and his consistently friendly, agreeable attitude arouses suspicions that there is something much more hidden under that smiling facade. Koizumi is the one who seems the least trustworthy, yet is the most approachable. Charisma and mystery make Koizumi an excellent character.\nAnd finally, we have Kyon--the sole voice of reason in the SOS Brigade. Kyon ranks among my top anime characters of all time simply because he's just so...normal. Painfully normal, in fact. In a way, Kyon represents us, the audience. Kyon finds the show's events just as absurd as we do. And that's why we relate to him. We empathize (or sympathize) for him. Kyon didn't ask for this, and yet he found it thrust upon him. Yet in the end he can't help but enjoy himself, even if it's just a little bit.\nDespite some misfires in the animation and less-than-attractive frames, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya remains an incredibly enjoyable watch. The first episode broadcast, \"The Adventures of Asahina Mikuru,\" is one of the funniest things I've ever seen (it's even better if you watch the 2009 episodes about the filming of the \"movie\"). In fact, the show as a whole is absolutely hysterical. Kyon has an endless amount of one-liners that, whether sarcastic or indignant, ruthlessly expose the absurdity that his life has become, to our delight. This is absolutely one of my favorite anime, and in my opinion the episode \"Someday in the Rain\" is one of the greatest anime episodes ever broadcast. If for some reason you haven't watched this show, or if you're new to anime, I implore you to watch the perfection that is The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    This is a brilliantly told story and a great study in structure. So let's talk about the structure. Note: if you watch this chronologically, you're making a mistake. The broadcast order of this anime starts off with episode 25 (chronologically). Hopefully I won't be spoiling too much by saying that this episode is the episode that comes after the second season of the show, which, keep in mind, released 3 years after this season. It is, in essence, the product of the second season and everything it tried to convey. You won't think anything of it when you see it, but the second season is\n          \n        spent leading up to that episode. It then takes the first two episodes to establish the universe it's in while inciting the drama and plot, which I would argue, are the best features of the series. It leaves you uneasy and confused as you, and the main character, cannot really trust or believe what you're told in this series, basically ever, even up to the end of the movie. After that, an episode of filler, one more of story and then we're on the filler train for a while. The filler in this; however, is not like the filler in most animes. It's not pointless. It's also told completely out of order, you get episode 7, 10, 9, 11, 27, and 26. None of which disclose too much plot, nor do they require you to know much plot to understand. The series flows thematically through the episodes, almost as if it was meant to be watched in this bizarre order... *cough cough*. They tend to be light-hearted, but relevant. And, being relevant means having this undertone of stress, this uneasiness that everything that happens is because the world isn't right. The cause and effect in every encounter IS the plot. The season then ends with episodes 5 and 6, which is the climax of the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. It sets an unmatched tone for the second season. \nThe plot and characters are great, everything else is either above average or slightly above average for this kind of series, but what I think makes it stand out the most is it's structure, so that's why I spent all my time talking about it. Anyways, I highly recommend it. The series is fine chronologically. I'd probably give it a 4, maybe a 5 if you skip the filler. There wouldn't be a reason in watching the filler if you watched it chronologically. The pacing would be pretty off and the structure inconsequential. Some characters would feel forced. Just watch it in it's broadcast order if you want to appreciate all the effort and the full ramifications of the plot. I'm rambling at this point. Enjoy the show!\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    All ye infidels who doth worship the pretender god Madoka beware! Haruhi is the one true God of anime, and those who dare say otherwise shall incur Her divine wrath! Oh man, the Haruhi Suzumiya series is one of those programmes that I loved the shit out of in my late middle school/early high school years and still adore to this very day. Equal parts awesome concept, gut-bustingly hilarious English dub, and equally hilarious comedy, Haruhi is one of the few programmes where I'll gladly jump aboard the bandwagon and praise it. \nAlack, it's also one of those franchises that's becoming increasingly ignored over the\n          \n        last few years. The light novels have been on hiatus for a couple of years (if I'm not mistaken) and its most recent instalments (with the exception of The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya) have had shall we say... mixed reception? Yeah, Endless Eight and The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan have their fans but the detractors are more than numerous. Regardless, the original Haruhi series which came out in 2006 is something that I say should be watched by all, detractors be damned.\nBefore I get into the contents of this review, I should just make one thing perfectly clear: it's best to watch the series in chronological order. I have no idea who the idiot was that thought airing this series out of of order would be a good idea, but I say that person at Kyoto Animation or TVTokyo or whatever needs to get fired and have their entire pension stripped away from them. It doesn't help that Crunchyroll of places decided to retain this irksome trend as well. Thankfully, we have websites like Kissanime to remedy that but it's still something to be mentioned. Anyway, with that nastiness out of the way, let's talk about what really makes Haruhi so fun to watch.\nHaruhi plays out like a strange cross between a mundane slice-of-life show and Bewitched, with a twist of Uncle Grandpa thrown into the mix: our average Joe with a dry, ironic wit comes across an eccentric girl who ultimately turns out to be an unwitting reality warper. Several beings, including an alien, an esper, and a time traveller find themselves gravitating toward our reality-warping heroine. If that weren't enough, our sarcastic protagonist always ends up having a part to play in the hijinks that go down, much to his own chagrin of course.\nThe story is divided up into two halves: the first 6-7 episodes (in chronological order), which is an overarching story where Kyon learns more about Haruhi and the last 7-8 episodes (in chronological order), which is mostly episodic comedy that involves the SOS Brigade taking on a random task just to appease God, lest She lead the world into oblivion. Whilst I'm quite the fan of the episodic comedy, I'm afraid I'll have to side with the detractors on this one by saying that the story episodes are better. Simply put, episodic comedy is inconsistent with some episodes being much funnier to watch than others. On top of that, comedy's subjective and not everyone's gonna find the same shit funny. \nMeanwhile, most (if not all) of Haruhi's detractors can at least agree that Haruhi's story-based episodes are quite involving. From the very beginning, you can tell that something major's going to go down very soon as Kyon meets Haruhi for the first time. No spoilers here, but I'll tell you this: I REALLY want to know what the rest of Haruhi could've been like if it kept up this kind of momentum. Alack, the geniuses at Kyoto Animation just had to do their own thing. It's moments like this that make me wonder what Haruhi would've been like if SHAFT got a hold of it (assuming they treat it like Zetsubou Sensei and NOT the Monogatari series, that is).\nIn terms of characters, they're certainly not compelling individuals by any stretch of the imagination but that doesn't make em any less entertaining to say the least. Itsuki is amusing, Yuki is Rei Ayanami 2.0, so she's automatically best girl, and Mikuru is the resident shy and timid moeblob (though to be fair, if I were Haruhi's chew toy, I'd probably be shy and timid around others as well). The best of the characters would definitely have to be Kyon because without his constant sarcasm, this entire show would probably end up being rather annoying to watch. Also, the fact that he's voiced by Crispin Freeman in the English dub also helps out immensely in terms of his likeability. It's like listening to Hideki from Chobits snarking at every stupid thing that Chii says!\nHaruhi herself is ultimately what will either make or break your experience. She's hot, she's hyper, and she also exhibits psychopathic tendencies. Imagine the male protagonist of a Rumiko Takahashi manga but with the gender swapped and a noticeable lack of empathy, and you'll basically have Haruhi in a nutshell. Don't get me wrong: Haruhi has that heart of gold somewhere but I really wouldn't put it past you if you end up hating the entire show because of how irksome she can get. THANKFULLY, she's balanced out by Kyon so she's not running TOO wild. Still though, I dread to imagine what the world would actually be like if Haruhi was real and she really turned out to be God.\nAnimation and sound are especially deserving of mention, considering how fucking AWESOME they are. Keep in mind that this show came out in 2006. Then again, this show ALSO came straight from Kyoto Animation so it's no wonder that everything looks so good. On another note, tell me how everyone in Haruhi can go into a dance sequence and it'll strangely fit with whatever song you decide to play over it? The animation would only serve to get better over time, as evidenced by the 2009 series and The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya.\nThe dub is also fucking amazing as well. Crispin Freeman, Wendee Lee, Johnny Yong Bosch, Stephanie Sheh, and Michelle Ruff all had a hand to play in this dub and it turned out beautifully. Crispin Freeman really hits the mark as Kyon, as does Wendee Lee as Haruhi, Johnny Yong Bosch as Itsuki, Stephanie Sheh as Mikuru, and Michelle Ruff as Yuki. Really, my only complaint with the dub is that Steve Blum didn't have a hand to play in it whatsoever! It's not fair that the last time Crispin Freeman and Steve Blum were in the same dub was in Wolf's Rain, and they didn't even interact all that much together that time! Sorry, just getting a little ahead of myself. Still kinda salty over that, but I digress.\nMy own personal enjoyment of Haruhi goes up and down. Whilst I still find Haruhi so fun to watch almost 10 years after I first watched it, I can't help but feel like there was so much more that could've been done. Then again, that's the hindsight talking. For what it's worth, Haruhi is a good show that really should've had a better follow-up. It's disappointing to see what became of one of my favourite programmes but then again, it's not like this show was widely beloved when it first hit the market anyway. There were still people who were talking smack about this show, and it would seem that their criticisms of the show have been vindicated over the years. For what it's worth though, Haruhi isn't without merit and it's a joy that should be experienced by all in the near future. Here's to hoping that Haruhi gets a reboot that properly adapts the LNs without any Endless Eights or shitty spin-offs happening any time soon. Anyway, that's all for now. Feedback's always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)\n        "},

Or that's how Kyon decided he'd ever realistically amount to, and, through his characteristically cynical monologues. Only idiots would believe in Santa Claus, and meeting aliens, time-travelers, and espers? Impossible. The rules of reality are law, and trying to change them would amount to nothing more but utter disappoint. And then an alien. And then a time-traveler. And then a mysterious, brown-haired, closed eyed bishonen... I mean esper. And the strangest of them all... god herself? Apparently she's into slave driving and bunny suits.\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (2006) was originally based off the light novel franchise by Nagaru Tanigawa.\n          \n        It was produced by Kyoto Animation, the same studio that animated the Full Metal Panic Series, the Key holy trinity, Hyouka, and K-On! Told through the narratives of our male protagonist, we follow the adventures of the SOS Brigade and its members' collective efforts to prevent the boredom, depression... melancholy of its hyper-eccentric leader, Ms. Haruhi Suzumiya. Why? Something to do with the end of the world as they know it. With script by Yutaka Yamamoto and Tatsuya Ishihara and direction solely by the latter, the show has two official airing different orders. I suspect by the end of production, the staff decided then and there to air everything in a format meant to distribute a good measure of comedic, relaxed, puzzle-bound, and action-oriented activity throughout. As a result, the new order, as opposed to a traditional airing, was chronologically tampered with. Somehow, they were able to arrange so that they able to transform what was obvious flaw in pacing into what was seen, heard, and felt by the masses as fresh. As innovative. As wildly successful, without being incredibly confusing. For example, for the last airing date of the anime, rather than showing what would otherwise be a whimper, the staff decided to end with an episode that is something on the lines of a bang. Naturally, I recommend watching in the order that the show was first broadcast in, though I caution viewers about the character development itself being all over the place. And whatever sequence one decides to go with, start with Episode 0.\nThe show boasts of a host of things that makes it already enjoyable as a comedy: parodies, homages, and strange, sudden, and enthralling developments galore, not to mention the laughs generated by Haruhi's bossy and outrageous antics and Kyon's sarcastic and libidinal observations and reactions. But far from the ear nips, facepalms, blackmail, and “beachballs,” the most rewarding experience, comes from how these two characters well each play off and subtly change the other's outlooks and, consequently, behaviors. Don't get me wrong, I like comedy. The comedy throughout was funny, sometimes to grandiose and hilarious scales, but I don't go out of my way to watch shows for laughs. I watch shows for insight. Not all comedy is just laughs, but much of it in this show was. Thankfully, I have something else to look forward to. Enter the relationship that fostered so naturally between Kyon and Haruhi. We get to see Haruhi as more than this boundless ball of headbanging activity. We get to follow Kyon as more than this passive complainer. And its more or less a product of their interactions. The rest of the main cast have been criticized for being more exaggerated caricatures than characters, of which I would say that there character development, however slight and seamless, with definite promises toward future progress. And even though they tread toward the former spectrum than the latter, I have to respond... so what? Yes, figuratively speaking, it would be nice if there was more meat under their skin to admire, but for all intents and purposes, what we have is fine. They establish the foundations for a richly imaginative setting while, through interaction, provide opportunity to flesh out Haruhi and Kyon during whatever adventures Haruhi gets them all into.\nWhat this show has to complement the enthusiasm that exudes from every pore of our main female protagonist is the natural vibrancy of the visuals. Character designs by Shoko Ikeda, modified from original sketchings by Noizi Itou, channel a charming amount of dynamism on their own, encompassing broad ranges of stoic, teary, cool, exited, irritated, melancholic, and whatever that look Haruhi gave to Kyon was supposed to express in Episode 13. Couple that with fast, fluid, and crisp spurts of animation, one can't help but feel a smidgen of that same spunk. The backgrounds and lighting are also stunning in their own right.\nDisregarding the OP for Episode 0 (it's something that can only be appreciated in the right context), the OP for the rest of the show, “Bōken Desho Desho?” or “It's an Adventure, Right? Right?” sung by Haruhi's Seiyū Aya Hirano and the ED “Hare Hare Yukai” or “Sunny Sunny Happiness,” sung by all the three Seiyūs that voice the main female cast, Yuko Goto and Minori Chihara as well as Hirano. By their names alone, both J-Pop titles would likely invite some hesitation (Kyon does a facepalm and headbutts a wall for crying out loud) but unbridled energy powers its audience, and that energy, coupled with robust, catchy vocals, makes for something rather enjoyable. The OP sequence is able to hint to the viewer, often through amusing means, a significant bit about each major cast member in a series of panels (save the other male main character aside from Kyon, who welcomes onlookers into a Big Bang-esque illustration later covered) and introduce just about everyone else in an explosion of stars, planets, rainbows, flowers, and SOS Brigade insignias. It looks better than it sounds. If the singing accompanying didn't make anyone a short-term addict, the ED's choreographed dancing will. The OST, in addition to providing for whatever tone the show decides it desires, has its standouts, notably the band numbers in Episode 12 of whatever order, where Hirano provided an amateurish touch to the concert to suit Haruhi's inexperience on stage while still sounding great. Wendi Lee's performance in the English Dub wasn't bad, but her voice wasn't as dynamic, nor was her pitch as consistent as her Japanese counterpart. One felt like a decent amateur job, while the other felt like an amateur on the rise to stardom. In addition, some of the facial expressions Hirano made while she sang provided the basis for Haruhi's facial expressions during her performance, bringing in intensity as well as demonstrating how much effort in animation was put into this scene, this episode, and, well, the whole series in general. High standards indeed.\nUnfortunately, the relationship between our odd couple, my primary draw into this show, is incomplete. It lacks the fulfillment granted to it by conflict. By conflict, I don't mean where the protagonists were are forced into an uncomfortable situation, say, in the event of a shinjin attack in closed space. I mean conflict that arises between their polar opposite personalities, their values, their outlooks on life... where a nerve is finally struck and it's just them just them disagreeing with the other. Haruhi's allows whatever impulses she has to have their way, and Kyon, in spite of all his protests to the contrary, lets her will what she wants most of the time. Well, changes do occur between the two, but they are so slight I can't help but have that nagging feeling at times of grasping straws. \nBut straws aside, the pacing is wisely steady enough to make do. The situations the characters get themselves into are extremely fun, and the characters themselves, even more so. And there's always the promise that these characterization issues will be addressed next season.\nI give The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (2006) an 8 out of 10.\n        "},

Is there any point in resisting convention, going against the grain, when it will just get him branded a weirdo and a social outcast, dealing with a day to day life that’s even more underwhelming than it was previously?

That’s when he met her.\nStanding proudly during first day introductions, wearing a stern expression and speaking directly with no room for misunderstanding, Haruhi Suzumiya proclaimed to her entire class that she’ll only waste any of her time on them if they’re aliens, time travelers, or espers.  This could have turned out to just be an inconsequential blip on the radar of Kyon’s life, if it wasn’t for the fact that while absently picking her brain, he winds up inspiring her to start her own school club, and use it to bring the weirdness of the world to her.  Kyon winds up dragged into this plan, having sealed his fate the minute he’d decided to poke the pretty-looking bear.  This club is named The SOS Brigade, a name that impressively makes less sense than it sounds, and Haruhi winds up dragging three more poor souls into her mess.  They turn out ot be interesting people, but as Kyon will soon find out, they might be just a little too interesting, and the supernatural phenomena that Kyon had once given up on may have been easier to find then he or Haruhi had thought.  With the boundaries between reality and fantasy becoming more blurred by the day, will Kyon ever be able to get his normal, boring life back?  Or will this bizarre new routine dominate his life forever?\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is part of what I like to call The Golden Age of Kyoto Animation, and yeah, a few points of this review are going to focus on the time frame of which it was released.  In any case, this golden age occurred between 2005 and 2008, after their inaugural effort Fullmetal Panic Fumoffu, but before they’d switch to a cheaper visual style with Clannad Afterstory.  The second season did fall victim to this change, but thankfully, Haruhi did not, and is a shining example of the kind of visual quality that it could put out back then.  Movement is fluid, with a lot of inbetween work being done to keep everybody looking as crisp and graceful as possible, and I’m not just talking about the people in the main section of the foreground.  you’ll lose track of the amount of background people, surrounding crowds and random cutaway figures there are who were given independent movement of their own, sometimes even just as good as what the main cast is getting.  It does slow down in parts, but aside from a few odd choices, it all blends together well.\nThere are some short-cuts here and there...  We get one extended segment where a character is just sitting at a chair and reading silently to herself for at least a minute or two, although you don’t have to reach very far up your ass to find an excuse for it.  That aside, Kyoani is generally very clever at disguising their budget cuts from view, often using camera angles and cinematography techniques that, at the time, were easily considered avant-garde, before Studio Shaft stole them and ran them into the ground.  Characters are almost realistically proportioned, and while the facial constructs lean towards moe, you wont find very many anime expression cliches in this title.  If I recall, there aren’t very many if any upturned eyes, sweatdrops, anger lines, etcetera to be found.  Instead, characters deliver their emotions through highly diverse and intricate facial expressions and body language.  This can be pretty useful for people trying to track the true feelings of the show’s more duplicitous characters, seeing through their nuances.\nBackgrounds are exquisitely detailed, down to the very smallest objects that can be pointed out in the SOS Brigade club room.  On the very rare occasions that the budget seems to be dropping, it’s normally indicative of an intense visual happening soon, such as Haruhi singing as the frontman in a school rock band, or an all-out, no holds barred action scene, because yes, this slice of life title has some serious action in it.  I won’t go into spoilers, at least not too deep, but when this series busts out the CGI, it’s time for jaws to start hitting the floor.  Even outside of the action, which may or may not involve space fleets, alternate dimensions and a giant cricket monster, even something as menial as flowing water in a river can wind up looking beautiful.  It’s a good looking show, way more-so than any title of it’s ilk has any business looking, and Kyoto Animation clearly put a lot of care and effort and good old fashioned give-a-damn into making it one of the most visually appealing titles they could.  \nThe music isn’t quite up to par with the visuals, but it’s serviceable enough.  There are several tracks that feel like they were ripped directly out of a dating game, considering how repetitive they are, but they’re still pretty fun to listen to, and a few of them have even become relatively iconic.  Even when creating tunes that are just going to fade into the background and get skipped after a few repetitions in the soundtrack, Satoru Kosaki does not skimp on effort.  A lot of different instruments are also used, from acoustic guitars to drums, trombones to bells, keyboards to full on electronic orchestrations, and it all comes together rather nicely.  The best tunes tend to pop up during action scenes, including one of the major electronic tracks, whose very name would be a spoiler of the pivotal scene it accompanies.  The climax of the series, which will happen either at the end or in the middle, depending on how you’re watching, even goes as far as to have a greek choir playing over the action and heightening the effect.\nOf course, that’s just the background music.  In all fairness, it probably wouldn’t be so easily taken for granted if it wasn’t for just how overwhelmingly the themes and insert songs stick out.  The reason you won’t come away from this series humming Oi Oi or Nanika no Okashi is because you’ll be too busy trying to get the Live Alive songs out of your head.  There’s a moment in the series when Haruhi and club-mate Yuki Nagato step in as subs for a couple of absentee members of one of the school’s biggest rock bands, and the two songs she performs...  God Knows and Lost My Music...  Are awesome.  Not only does this scene feature some of the best animation in the series, as Haruhi is so viscerally articulated on stage that she’ll make YOU feel exhausted afterwards, but they work just as well in stand-alone for as they do in context.  I’ve even heard from some people that they’re meant to be metaphorical for her relationship with Kyon, but I personally don’t see what they’re getting at.  \nBut who are we kidding?  The real stars here are the opening and closing themes, both of which can easily be counted among the best of all time.  Much like the rock and roll tracks, the opening and closing are sung by Haruhi’s Japanese voice actress Aya Hirano, who both is and was a famous singer, and that talent is put to spectacular use in character.  The opening, Bouken Desho Desho, which basically translates to “It’s an Adventure, Right?  Right?!”  Is beautifully animated with imagery that keeps pace with an incredibly catchy song, chronicling aspects of both Haruhi’s everyday life and fantasy life.  The closing theme is by far the most recognizable of the bunch, Hare Hare Yukai, which translates to Sunny Sunny Happiness, and it’s notoriety can be drawn directly to it’s usage in a one-time viral video that set it to a full length, elaborate choreographed dance sequence, which was clearly designed to be addictive on both audio and visual terms.  That dance is used partially in the ending theme, but they still featured all the best bits to entertain anyone who doesn’t feel like skipping ahead.\nThe English dub, an effort by Bang Zoom Entertainment, is a mixed bag to say the least.  The writing, while nowhere near the worst effort I’ve ever heard, can occasionally sound forced and unnatural, as though the turn of phrase that they use to match the lip flaps doesn’t always sound like actual human speech.  It’s not easy to describe, but for a handy example, imagine the line “Like a cat” were extended to “Like some kind of high-strung pet or something.”  That’s an extreme generalization, mind you, but hopefully it will give you an idea of just how awkward the dialogue can get at times.  Normal sounding words are swapped out for longer versions that don't sound quite right, and entire sentences are sometimes rewritten for seemingly no reason at all.  It gets pretty cringey when Crispin Freeman decides to ad-lib, because while his penchant for it may have resulted in a great line or two in .Hack, there’s something off-putting about a fifteen year old calling his friend “Sport.”  I’m probably being too harsh, as these moments are relatively rare, but they do happen.  Of course the writing is at it’s worst with the two Live-Alive songs, which don’t translate nearly as well to English as the songs from Beck do.\nThe acting, thankfully, is leagues above the writing, which I guess you could call serviceable over-all.  First off, the name in the title may be Haruhi Suzumiya, but the main protagonist is Kyon, and his combination of snarky commentary and exasperated reactions make up about a third of the over-all dialogue.  He narrates the story, doles out the occasional exposition dump, and plays the part of the audience cypher, albeit with more than enough personality to stand up as a fully realized character.  Crispin Freeman is borderline perfect for this part, and while he may sound a little too old for the part, he sells every bit of it flawlessly.  He’s said at a panel that he tries to play every part with genuine sincerity, and he proves it here.  Wendee Lee plays the titular character, and while I hate to say that she sounds a bit miscast in the beginning, as she sounds a bit too tame and controlled to really live up to Haruhi’s spark of insanity, she does grow into the part as the series progresses, eventually standing on equal footing with Kyon.\nThe other actors...  Well, it’s a little difficult to talk about them without going too far into spoiler territory, but I’ll try my best.  Out of the characters that gravitate towards the SOS Brigade, for their own purposes of course, they all talk in fairly standard, almost stereotypical ways...  This is very much intentional, for reasons you’ll come to understand, and it really takes multiple viewings to catch all of the little nuances and secret meanings that all three actors were trusted to convey.  For example, johnny Yong Bosch plays the laid back, eager to please Itsuki Koizumi, and while he’s rarely seen without a smile, an astute viewer can pick up on what he’s really feeling, with a little bit of context to go with the small changes in Bosch’s delivery.  Stephanie Sheh is playing very much to type, but she’s played her fair share of duplicitous characters, and the slight changes she makes in a particular episode are significant.  Michelle Ruff almost feels wasted playing the monotonous role of Yuki Nagato, although in her case, she doesn’t show much variety until the second season.  Perhaps the most impressive of these comes with Bridget Hoffman’s turn as a Class Rep character who’s sweet smile takes on a whole new meaning in one of the show’s climactic moments.\nWhen The Melanchoy of Haruhi Suzumiya came out just over ten years ago, it was like nothing the anime medium had seen before, and it changed the landscape in ways we’re still seeing to this day.  You may think that’s a compliment, but this series serves as living proof of how an entity can be too influential for it’s own good.  First of all, taking a look at it’s most obvious contribution, Haruhi proved that a light novel adaptation can be a serious financial success.  No, it’s not the first show of it’s kind to enter the public consciousness, what with titles like Read or Die and The Twelve Kingdoms being modest successes, but the vast majority of light novel adaptations that have come out did so after 2006, and you have Haruhi to thank for it.  One of the ways it did this was by using odd camera angles and framing techniques to keep the viewer’s attention during long stretches of dialogue, an avant-garde tactical style it used sparingly, but was soon picked up by Akiyuki Shinbo, a Shaft director who would run it into the ground with the various Monogatari and Zetsubou Sensei titles that he put out, as well as other various properties, ultimately making the technique feel so cliched and pretentious that you really can’t look at Haruhi the same way anymore.\nAnd it doesn’t stop there.  The very premise of the series, which I won’t spoil, has been copied and twisted around over and over again by people trying to one up the original product and make their own little profit off of what they see as a proven trend.  Some of these titles include Sasami-San@Ganbaranai, Kotoura-san, and Haganai, each of which take a different approach to recapturing Haruhi’s proverbial lightning in a bottle.  On a more simple note, the premise of a socially unacceptable person forming a school club with unclear motives that has to find the necessary member count to stay open while filling itself up with odd characters and generally proving to be a nuisance for more people than not...  Yes, all of that...  Has become a very popular trend in and of itself thanks to Haruhi.  Worst of all, this premise has been adopted by the harem genre, and is often used to sell merchandise based on color-coded characters from said clubs.  That’s not even all, because it also proved how successful a series can be if it panders to otaku in just the right way, offering both a tongue-in-cheek parody and a sincere love letter to otaku culture, in a very for-the-fans, by-the-fans kind of way.  \nWhere Haruhi Suzumiya was once one of the most popular and interesting shows around, It’s inspired so many copy-cats over the last decade that it’s kind of difficult to look at it with the same sense of awe that it originally inspired.  What was once one of the most popular anime on the block is barely mentioned by contemporary audiences, and it’s all due to just how poorly the series has aged.  Watching it in 2017, without that nostalgic context to back it up, it can get a bit cringey.  I’m not saying that’s necessarily a bad thing, I’ve been guilty of turning up my nose at older anime in favor of newer titles that managed to surpass them before, but I really don’t think any of the anime that Haruhi inspired have really managed to surpass it...  They’ve instead drove it’s best qualities into the ground, and while  I don’t think that’s entirely fair, it does become easier to see the flaws in the material with all of those distractions taken out of the way.  This includes a certain weakness in characterization, as aside from our two leads, none of the characters really impress outside of their gimmicks and relations to the plot(at least not this season), and this lack of depth can be a serious flaw if you’re not totally engulfed in what you’re watching.\nOne of the biggest problems, however, is the story structure.  This season of the series was released out of order in Japan, and while that may not come as a surprise to anybody who regularly watches the Fox network, it’s a rarity among anime.  It was done this way because when you watch the season in chronological order, the climax of the series happens in episode 7, followed by a bunch of loosely related episodic stories.  This is partially because of the fact that it follows the first few volumes of the light novel to an almost religious degree of accuracy, and the first book really is the main story, with every following novel expanding and continuing the universe.  I’ve read the books, and yeah, once the first novel’s over, you don’t really get anything resembling a major plot until the Disappearance story several volumes later.  Because of this, the first season peaks early, and while that never bothered me for the first few years after my initial viewing, I did start to get what people were complaining about upon my recent rewatch.  \nIt turns out the solution they came up with, and that I alluded to earlier, was to air the episodes out of order, giving you a jumbled and confusing experience, but hey, at least the peak is near the end, and the spoilers aren’t given away early!  I’ll be honest, I’ve never watched it this way, but I’m also pretty sure it would only work for you if you were coming into the series blind and for the first time.  Either way, this does make for a damned if you do, damned if you don’t kind of experience, neither method really offering a complete, satisfying experience.  Even when I was trying to expose one of my friends to the series, all I showed him was the first seven episodes, three episodes of season 2, and the movie.  The rest is largely unimportant from a plot standpoint, pointless fluff that’s geared exclusively towards people who are in love with the style and characters and just want to see more of them, which I am, although I know that I’m in a vocal minority in that respect.  And if that were it’s only problem, I’d be a lot more forgiving of it.\nAside from the innovations I mentioned earlier, the only trope that this series actually manages to subvert is the Manic Pixie Dream Girl one, as we’re initially led to believe that Haruhi will be filling that role, but no, Kyon winds up filling that role for HER.  That’s really clever.  But every other trope that appears in this show...  Every cliche they used, every character archetype, every story convention...  They just exist.  They appear, someone mentions the fact that they’ve appeared, and that’s about as much effort as it puts in.  This is a very self-aware series, to be sure, but self-awareness does not equal depth, nor does it qualify a story to call itself smart or satirical.  You can’t even really call it mature, as even with the show’s biggest secret revealed, the premise ultimately boils down to humoring an insufferable brat to keep them from throwing a world-ending tantrum.  Kyon and Haruhi are one of my favorite anime pairings, as I really do feel that they complete each other, but that dynamic is still pretty questionable, almost as much so as the self-insert stuff that’s going on, but don’t even get me started on that.\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was available from Bandai Entertainment, and while that company did go under, it’s been rescued and redistributed by Funimation.  The entire series can be found on DVD and Bluray in countless different collections and formats, very few of which are actually expensive.  A second season, as well as a movie called The disappearance, are also similarly available.  Spin-off series Haruhi-chan and Churuya-Chan are also available.  Several different written versions, including the original light novel series by Nagaru Tanigawa a handful of manga adaptations are also available stateside.  \nWell, I did it...  I went into this review as honest and unbiased as I could, and as a result, I wound up saying much worse things about it than I originally intended.  I’m still not sure I’ve scratched the surface of it’s issues.  It’s nowhere near as smart or well written as it pretends to be, and while that does fall well within the definition of pretension, it never really goes as far as to feel pretentious.  It is, as another reviewer once pointed out, to moe what Evangeleon is to Mecha...  An awesome blast of fun when taken at face value, but puddle deep at best, and it just gets more and more shallow under scrutiny.  Now, with me saying all that, you probably think I’ve turned my back on this show, and that I wouldn’t recommend it to modern viewers.  You’d be wrong.  Not only do I still love it, not only is it still number three on my top ten favorite anime list, but I still believe that even with all of it’s problems, there are still very good reasons to watch this show, even in 2017.  In addition to offering a look back at one of the biggest shows of the 2000s, and setting up it’s more modern analogues, it’s still just as fun and entertaining as it ever was, but don’t expect anything too profound from it.  I give The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya a 7/10.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Story: 10\nFirstly, for purposes of this review I am talking about the episodes in chronological order, though they did not air that way.  (I'll explain this later)\nOk, the series starts out very mysterious and you honestly don't know what going on.  But this all changes by episode six which ends the first plot.  The most pressing mysteries are revealed, kind of.  After that it switches to episodic format, which normally would kill a plot based series, but it doesn't do that.  It just makes it fun.\nDefinitely the most unique creation I have ever seen when it comes to anime. \n          \n        This show, in just fourteen episodes, covers five genres!  You honestly have no idea what to expect out of it next.  And somehow it made highschool... epic?\nThe ending episode was nice... but I felt a little dissatisfied and felt the story should go farther, which it does!  A new series was released in 2009, so the fans after three whole years finally saw the return of the series.  (however I've heard a lot of complaining concerning that series... I'll reserve judgment).\nNow, this series can get confusing as far as what order do you watch it in.  The show possesses three possible orders of viewing.  The orders are: chronological, Kyon's, and Haruhi's.  You can watch them in any of the three orders, I personally saw it in chronological.\nArt: 10\nTwo words, Kyoto Animation.  They have done it again.  Granted, not all series done by Kyoto Animation are this good, but this one is.  The movement of the characters are always smooth, and there are no annoying still shots.  The actual design of the characters, besides the high quality, makes them seem to blend in with many other anime, however I think they were meant to look normal and the affect only makes them even more surprising.  Backgrounds are very well done, the reason is because most of them are drawn from real locations, and keep true almost exactly.  Shading is also perfect and makes the characters seem very three dimensional.\nSound: 10\nShields: check!  Weapons: check!  Forward Thruster: check!  Voice acting: check!  Background music: OH YEAH!!!\nQuite literally, you can't get much better than this.  There are even two musical numbers done by Aya Hirano!!!  The enviroment sounds also feel like you have been sucked into Haruhi's world.  The voice acting is also well done, in both the sub and the dub, however... in the dub Wendee Lee should not have been Haruhi.  And that's really too bad because I like Wendee, just this role was not for her.  Also, the English voice actor for Kakashi Hatake from Naruto voices the computer club president, you will soon realize why that creeped me out.\nCharacter: 10\nThe cast is all fun and enjoyable and I can't say there's anyone I dislike.  Kyon is perfect as the narator for the story and personal slave of Haruhi.  Haruhi is spunky and in general is the most endearing character with simply being unique and unpredictable.  (The fact that Aya Hirano voices her helps!).  However the best character I think personally is Yuki Nagato.  She's just so cool!  It may take a while to see why, but once you start to see under her serious mask, she'll hopefully win your heart too.\nOverall: 10\nThis is only the second series I've watched deserving of this rating.  It really is that good.  There are no real flaws I can point out (though I did look long and hard).  It's a fun filled exciting journey that will bring you from high school to outer space (I'm serious).  The show is a world wide phenomenon, and though it has more guy appeal there is a huge female fanbase and this show probably has something for everybody.\nParental Caution:\nRated PG-13\n-This show is NOT for younger children, just accept that. (as are all of my series so far I've noticed, I need to watch some G and PG stuff.  Anyway I'm rambling.)\n-The intro has fanservice.\n-Haruhi does a chest grab to Mikuru.\n-Haruhi uses Mikuru for blackmail purposes by pushing a guy onto her.\n-Haruhi treats Mikuru like her own personal doll and dresses her in a variety of fetish costumes.\n-Haruhi sees men as sacks of potatoes so didn't care when she started to change for phys-edd in the class room one time.  Nothing is shown besides her bra before the scene change.\n-Haruhi and Mikuru are in bunny costumes on numerous occasions.\nAre you starting to get the idea that Haruhi does the vast majority of things?  It is all a part of the comedy but admittedly it's beyond acceptable behaviour.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    So what is this?\nIt's not entirely absurdist or self indulgent. It's just a very weird coming of age story set about a centerpiece character, Haruhi. Whatever the hell the title means is irrelevant, this anime is very enjoyable even if it doesn't seem to make sense at first.\nIt's not helped by the fact that the episodes were aired out of order--something that has beeen rectified by the american subbers. Whether the idea to show an anime completely out of order was brilliant or a fucktard idea, I'll forego the details.\nHaruhi can do stuff. On the surface she's an overenergetic school girl, who suddenly finds herself\n          \n        surrounded by increasingly improbable characters--from time traveling agents, to androids, to espers and the like. The main character, tho, isn't the titular one, but Kyon. Kyon is Sisyphus. The show makes no effort in hiding this, it would have been better if it had, but whatever.\nKyon narrates the story of Haruhi and the increasingly complex events surrounding her through a rather odd (read normal) perspective since it is soon revealed that time and space are relative elements and a some great realization (central to the plot) has essentially changed the nature of the universe, all of it seems centered around Haruhi--and this is something the main characters are aware of, but act on in different ways, whether through intervention, guidance, observation, or whatnot.\nIt mostly works, with episodes ranging from a baseball game, to a school concert to a Sisyphean ordeal of a space heater, to core elements of the plot. In its out of order original Japanese version most of the events sort of take you by surprise, something that the show in proper order doesn't seem to accomplish. The characters are entertaining and well put together. Haruhi remains 'real' and vulnerable without stooping to the usual babbling anime girl stereotype. \nKyon is the obvious, unwilling protagonist, but manages to escape the typical shortfalls of an anime male lead mostly by his ironic grasp of the reality presented to him. There are others, mostly moe Mikuru and Yuki (but the latter having redeeming moments, but often existing for advancing the plot).\nOverall this is an overhyped but well done anime that despite having a jumbled plot manages to make sense of it all in the end. It falls victim to hype, but is good enough to stand on its own. The endearing characters and overall production elevate it above average.\nChoose to watch it in whatever order you want.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    The three episodes of The Meloncholy of Haruhi Suzumiya reminded me why anime is so popular to begin with. Because Haruhi is such a fucking weirdo.\nBut isn't that the point? Anime is fucking weird. That's part of what makes it so attractive to faggots like me. It goes against social norms, and occasionally, bothers to shit on them and laugh in their face. Haruhi is also symbolic of anime as a whole by shoving gratuitous fan service in my face. Unfortunately, these scenes just make me feel uncomfortable, as one would when watching a teenaged girl's clothes be forcibly removed against her will. In episode\n          \n        2, we get the predictable and slow-as-shit reveal that the quiet girl is actually an alien. In episode 3, we get two more slow-as-shit exposition dumps and start to learn that Haruhi unknowingly manipulates space time and that if she isn't pleased, she could accidentally rupture the multiverse or something. It was at this point that the show started to feel like a really elaborate set-up for a plot-heavy porno, as Haruhi herself is somewhat perverted and weird enough to believably be placed in any range of erotic scenarios, and the dire need for her to be constantly satisfied gives sufficient reason for the other characters to get involved. \nI stopped watching when I realized the website I was using had listed the episodes in chronological order, rather than the broadcast order I'd rather see. Instead of continuing the series I ventured to DeviantArt to look at erotic Haruhi fan fiction which, as suspected, totally exists and is totally rockin'.\nUltimately, this show left me with a desire to beat off my dick off. Thus it earns a 6/10.\n        "},

It really had the potential to be deep and philosophical while being funny and entertaining... but instead we get a boring slice of live with little character development, filler episodes and a pathetic attempt to introduce romance to it (that will be forgotten on the next episode).\n*Art: 6*\nIt's OK, nothing bad but I wouldn't\n          \n        call it great.\n*Sound: 6*\nGood opening, catchy ending and a fairly good insert song (God Knows).

(it's really forgetable, and I mean it literally, I can't remember it at all).\n*Character: 2*\n2 character are obnoxious, 1 character is only for fanservice, 1 character is the typical Rei Ayanami expy and the other character is the protagonist. No one of them has any development.\n*Enjoyment: 1*\nIf I want to see an slice of life school comedy I would rather watch Nichijou or Azumanga Daioh.\n*Overall: 3*\nThis anime is the very definition of \"overrated\". I would rather watch any of those mass-produced supernatural fighting-school harem soft-ecchi animes than giving this thing a second chance. The only good thing about this anime is that at least it isn't Highschool of the Dead.\n        "},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    I just don't understand why people like this anime. Are they so bored with their lives that they need to upvote everything that sparks some kind of emotion in them? Watch  stories of abuse, hardship, bullying and mark them as comedy - the message I got from this anime ... oh and that a lot of people are not capable of empathy.\nI was disgusted with the fact that this anime was rated so high. I just don't get it how can you like a sociopath that threats a meek and kind girl in the way Haruhi treats Mikuru. Nobody would like to be closer\n          \n        than 5 meters to this kind of person much less forming a school club. \nShe is a God? Meh, more likely a devil. So what!? You like the moral advice to be submissive to anything that is more powerful than you? Is better living like a slave rather than not living? Is this the moral lesson of this story?\nI don't think anyone would like to live in a world like this. Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu is utter nonsense and just tries to hide all the bullshit logic, false moral dilemmas and non existent philosophical questions of the series. \nSo let me act like Suzumiya Haruhi and tell to everyone that liked this anime: you are not very smart because if I say so and I am God.\n        "},

While on one hand it tries to experiment with structure and the subverting of watcher expectations, on the other hand most of it it's a comedy... and well, I just don't find it that funny.\nMost of the characters are bland and vaguely stereotypical (and I've heard arguments for the fact that they are SO stereotypical because they are trying to subvert those archetypes, which I... well, don't really buy), and the humor itself is either playing on those characters' \"quirky\" personality or referencing other animes, both of which I don't find to be done in a\n          \n        particularly interesting way.\nTo top that I find Haruhi's character and what she turns out to be very... off-putting, as it tries in some form to subvert the manic pixie dream girl trope but somehow ends up with an even worse character by doing so.\nI will assume this is a series that can be a lot more enjoyable for people who are really into the whole otaku culture thing, as they will probably will be far more receptive to the constant parodying of anime genres and situations. Personally I found it a bundle of interesting ideas brought down by its own niche appeal.\n        "},

I like the sci-fi subjects as well, since I consider myself an avid sci-fi fan. The title itself is unique and shows some irony. Haruhi created the SOS Brigade to have fun with aliens, time travelers, espers, sliders, etc. She actually does fulfill this in every way, but she doesn't know her own companions are exactly what she wants. The plot is very interesting and makes your mind do so many backflips, you just might awaken your psychic abilities or ESP. The main characters' city truly is \"the holy ground for\n          \n        weirdos\";mostly because of Haruhi. Overall, the anime has been insanely intriguing and plain awesome. I hope they will make a third season of this anime. I don't like the new anime The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-Chan. They should've used the original graphics for the main characters. If they introduce a bit more of the atmosphere in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, the show would've been awesome. They also should make the two shows connect in their plots in a crossover. I recommend this anime to anyone who call themselves an anime lover or sci-fi fan.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, a sci fi, supernatural, slice of life, comedy anime. It's good. Pretty good. If you are interested in time travel, parallel worlds, future versions of characters, espers, world changing powers, then this anime is definitely one to watch. Let's get down to the review;\nStory:\nHaruhi Suzumiya is a high school girl, intelligent, beautiful, athletic. Pretty much a school idol. But she isn't interested in everyday human activities. The things that interest are espers, aliens and time travelers. Kyon, an average high school boy who wants to have a normal high school life with his friends. But things take a turn in\n          \n        Haruhi's favor once Kyon starts talking with her. A few days later, Kyon meets an alien who explains Haruhi's importance in this universe. Then he goes on meeting other supernatural and sci fi phenomenon. And so the sci fi supernatural life of Kyon begins as he and the rest of the SOS Brigade try to make Haruhi happy in her adventurous life that could cause the whole world to collapse due to her thoughts. The series doesn't exactly follow a fixed storyline. It just shows different situations created by Haruhi which Kyon and the others have to solve without her knowing. But it is quite interesting. The story is well developed and is well explained. You might not understand much the first time, but slowly as the series reaches the end, everything becomes clear.\nA little comedy in every episode. Mostly the complaints of Kyon when he's slave driven by Haruhi. Not much of a romance factor to the anime but HaruhiXKyon all the way.\nCharacters:\n-Kyon: An average high school boy who wants to live a normal life but things take a turn for the worse for him when he realizes his importance in the universe. Especially in Haruhi's perspective.\n-Haruhi Suzumiya: The person around which the whole world revolves. On the outside, a beautiful, atheletc high school girl. But on the inside, a girl tired of this world and someone who wants adventure and will do anything to get it.\nAll the main characters are interesting and have a unique ability or atmosphere to them. Haruhi, the main character, doesn't get much screen time as one would expect. On the other hand, Kyon gets the whole show to himself.\nCharacter developments are nice. The stories and origin of the characters are told. Some may have more complex situations as compared to others. Kyon might be the simplest character to understand.\nOh, and some bad guys are needed in an anime. Well, you do get one for this series too.\n\nSound:\nA good opening song and a good ending song. It's catchy, nice to hear once, twice and then it's enough. Not something so bad that you'll punish yourself for not skipping it.\nArt:\nThe artwork, designs and animation is good. The character designs fit the personalities perfectly. Even by seeing the characters, you might be able to predict the personality of each character.\nEnjoyment:\nFirst time watching, things get confusing if you don't pay attention to the sequence of events. But it is enjoyable. It's got the sci fi stuff for a sci fi fan but not so much that the slice of life fans would be turned off. An enjoyable anime, with some laughs here and there, little romance, sci fi supernatural stuff and a good plot and story. I would suggest the chronological order of watching the anime since that's how I watched it. Some arcs might be plain boring and some might be so interesting as to watch them again.\nOverall, it's an interesting anime. Sometimes it turns into a filler type series with senseless stuff and sometimes it gets interesting enough to rewatch the episode. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it. I watched it 2 times. It's got a sequel too and a movie.\nDo have a go at them once you find this series interesting.\nAnd a slight heads up, the movie is the best sci fi thriller I've seen. If you manage to make it past the series, you've struck gold with the movie.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    Let me say right off the bat that this review pertains to ONLY the first season of the Haruhi franchise. With that out of the way, let's begin. I will say that I've tried my very best to understand the hype and fame around this show. Unfortunately, I can't understand it. I've attempted to look at this show objectively, and here are the observations I made:\nStory: 6\nThe story is honestly not as great as many people portray it as. It's about a girl (Haruhi) who is the god of the universe. Everybody in the SOS does everything in their power to prevent Haruhi from getting\n          \n        bored or angry, otherwise, the world is over. It's a unique premise that is done in a very cliche manner. High school. Club activities. Ring any bells? Of course they do. It's been done a billion times before.\nArt: 8\nThe art is very solid. Kyoto Animation did a very good job in making the characters fluid in their movements. What I did appreciate, was the fact that the characters had their own unique appearances, save Kyon and Koizumi. The high school and club setting is portrayed well by the animators, as these venues serve as the primary locations for the majority of the show. \nSound: 8\nOf first mention is the music. The music is okay, but it's not something to really right home about. I know I may get flamed for not liking the Haruhi theme music, but it has a very similar sound to the majority of openings and endings from other high school slice of life comedies. The Japanese voice actors do a great job in their roles here in the show, but of surprise here is the quality of the English dubbed voice actors. I guess animation companies finally realized that sticking Wendee Lee behind the mic of the leading female protagonist yields good results. Alongside Lee is Johnny Yong Bosch, Crispin Freeman, and Michelle Ruff. The English dubbed cast has years of experience, and it shows in the quality.\nCharacter: 5\nThis is the biggest gripe I have with the show. Because Haruhi is established right from the get go as the center of the universe, this idea of ego stroking becomes prevalent as the series progresses. The fact that Haruhi is a tsundere character isn't what bothered me. What bothered me was the lack of character development for each character. Kyon was the biggest disappointment for me in this show. He had so much potential to grow in the series, but didn't. Luckily, this is fixed in The Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi. Ashahina doesn't grow from the bimbo girl with big boobs. She stays the same. Koizumi doesn't develop whatsoever. His entire purpose is to spout chunks of information to the audience in hopes they understand what he's talking about. Nagato is practically an emotionless rock throughout the entire show and doesn't seem to develop whatsoever. The moment when Haruhi was yelled at, or slapped, or shown the error of her selfish ways never occurred even though by episode 9, I was dying to have Haruhi realize that she can't keep having people jump through hoops for her. \nEnjoyment: 6\nIn all honesty, I didn't really enjoy the show all that much. I really attempted to find some aspect I liked, but I couldn't. I found it incredibly boring and I found myself falling asleep at some points. However, the comedy was pretty funny at some points, and for me, was the only real highlight of each episode.\nOverall: 6\nI cannot give this show anything higher than a 6. This show had the right premise for a story, but went about it the wrong way. The characters were a little too cliche for my liking. The art and sound were the high points of this anime. I found the anime to be boring because by the time I was half way through, I knew no character development was going to occur. Many people love this show, but unfortunately, I was not one of them.\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Summary:  Kyoto Animation&rsquo;s masterpiece transcends mere excellence to become a model for the potential of anime.\nStory- 7\nHaruhi is what I would call a &ldquo;half episodic&rdquo; anime.  Approximately half of the episodes are tied to the central plot and the other half are episodic, creating a weird hybrid, made even stranger by the fact that the episodes are not in chronological order.  Typically I don&rsquo;t like episodic shows, but most of the episodes in Haruhi are just sensational, with some unfortunate exceptions (I&rsquo;m looking at you, lone island syndrome).  The central plot is very good though.\nUnfortunately, the plot is confused by broadcasting\n          \n        the show in weird, non-chronological order, which gets irritating.  While I understand why KyoAni made that choice, at times it detracts from watching the show.\nAs I mentioned before, I strongly recommend watching the show in chronological order AFTER watching it in broadcast order.  Watch the broadcast order first.\nAs for what the plot is about&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s a pretty crazy highschool romance/comedy/slice of life/ scifi/action/drama/harem/pseudo-philosophical ramble.  There&rsquo;s something for everyone, and it&rsquo;s fun and fresh.\nAnimation- 9\nWhen the show came out in 2006, it had sensational art for its time, incorporating lots of CG effects, along with sophisticated character designs and backgrounds taken from real locations in Japan.  Now, two years later, large use of CG effects has become much more widespread, and subsequent Kyoto Animation works (such as Clannad) have used them even more heavily, so Haruhi does not stand   Nevertheless, the art still looks terrific.  Characters dress in a variety of clothing (one of my pet peeves is when characters only seem to have one set of clothes in their wardrobe), but where the art of Haruhi really excels is in its rendering of the characters faces.  Characters&rsquo; subtle expressions are conveyed beautifully (Nagato and Koizumi especially) and the characters even blink, which only adds more realism.  The cg effects are used effectively, and are generally fairly unobtrusive.  For certain scenes, such as the concert scene is episode 12, live alive, KyoAni ratchets up the animation even further, boosting the frame rate and adding even more detail.  Details in general abound throughout the show, as comical (and occasionally somewhat important) interactions often can be seen in the background while central characters are in the foreground of a shot.\nMy only quibble with the animation is that at times it can &ldquo;loop&rdquo;&mdash;ie characters in the background perform the same action over and over again.  This was most egregious in the concert scene of live alive, when members of the audience made the same cheering motion again and again.  Nevertheless, that&rsquo;s a minor complaint, and the artwork of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya looks flat out terrific.\nSound- 10\nMost of the Soundtrack for Haruhi is solid, but hardly spectacular, and none of the background tracks really stands out.  However, Haruhi augments its standard soundtrack with excerpts from pieces of classical music at particularly important points in the show.  These add a whole new level of epicness, and work extremely well.  Additionally, Haruhi boasts original songs in the unforgettable concert scene (wow, this is now the third time I&rsquo;ve mentioned it), which actually sound really really good.  This supplementary music turns a good soundtrack into a great one.\nVoice acting is also terrific.  Aya Hirano is sensational as Haruhi, a role that may well be the defining one of her career.  The other 4 voice actors for the central characters give strong performances as well (I&rsquo;m especially a fan of the job that Minori Chihara did withYuki), and even some secondary characters such as Tsurya-san  sound great.  Most of the secondary characters sound very average, which isn&rsquo;t really a bad thing.\nFinally, I think I&rsquo;m one of the few people out there who wasn&rsquo;t a big fan of the OP or ED.  They sounded okay, but I don&rsquo;t see how the Hare Hare Yukai set off a goofy dance craze.  Nevertheless, a very strong soundtrack coupled with terrific voice acting gets a ten from me.\nCharacter- 10\nThis was a really easy 10 to give.  Haruhi manages to take stale character archetypes -the tsundere, the silent girl, the moeblob, etc- and make them seem new and fresh (well, not so much with the moeblob, but most of them seem fresh).  What makes the show really work is the interactions between the characters.  Often, characters will interact in really subtle ways, showing emotion silently through facial expression.  However, it is difficult to find yourself not liking these characters- they are all somewhat more complex than they appear (yes, even Mikuru).\nThe character which large numbers of people seem to dislike is of course the title character, Haruhi Suzumiya.  Yes, she is totally obnoxious to Kyon initially.  But she also has many redeeming qualities, and develops very well as a character as the show progresses.  Haruhi&rsquo;s determination and manic energy colliding with Kyon&rsquo;s hilariously cynical nihilism is what makes the show tick.\nFinally, I recommend that this show be watched twice- First in broadcast order, then in chronological order.  The second viewing really helps clarify and enhance character development, making the whole series more enjoyable.\nBasically, the characters in this show are awesome.  Even minor side characters are really enjoyable to watch.\nAnd Yuki is love &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3\nEnjoyment- ? What does this mean?  Isn&rsquo;t this the same as my overall score?  K&hellip;\nConclusion:\nI chose Haruhi for my first review because I doubt I will ever give out this many tens again, so I figured this anime was the best one to begin with.  \nHaruhi is often accused of being &ldquo;overrated&rdquo;, and Haruhi nuts can be annoying, but frankly it deserves the glowing reviews because it genuinely is a masterpiece, and I am sure that it is going to become a classic.  Honestly, there is no reason for one not to watch this show.  Romance?  Check.  Fanservice? Check.  Space battles? Check.  Homoerotic males? Check.  And it&rsquo;s freaking hilarious.\nNow if only season 2 would come sooner&hellip;   "},

I always frown at inconsistencies.\nIt seemed to me that Haruhi's over-active/bossy/nosy/extortionist attitude that we have all grown to... tolerate was played up to a much greater extent in the new series episodes than in\n          \n        the older release. At times I actually wished Kyon would have smacked her silly she was so delusional and inconsiderate of her minions.\nI really enjoyed the episodes about shooting the movie for the culture festival \"The Sigh of Suzumia Haruhi I-IV\". Quite amusing and mildly entertaining. I remember watching the original series and that first episode being a complete and total brain-frappe. I had nothing to reference it against as I hadn't even read the light novels at all and was watching it at a good friend's suggestion, it really was more interesting after seeing everything come together.\nOverall I gave this a 6, would have been much higher if the endless eight had sucked less.\n** MINOR SPOILER ALERT **\nDO NOT watch the endless eight. I watched the whole thing hoping for some sort of interesting \"ah-hah!\" moments and came up empty handed. If you must know the storyline I submit to you this equation in-stead, it should be allot less painful and certainly less time-consuming.\n( [stereotypical summer episode] x 7 )\nX  by slight variation in camera angles \n+ 5 minutes of new content in ep8 \n___________________________\n= complete waste of time.\nI think the producers of the show were laughing hysterically as they cashed their paychecks.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    Hi everyone!\nFirst and foremost, I would like to start off by informing you that this is my first review. I have lurked on here for quite a while before I felt confident enough to have a go at writing a review. So I encourage you to leave feedbacks/constructive criticisms regarding my writing style. Please also keep in mind that English is not my first language so feedbacks regarding that are also greatly appreciated.\nI asked for a few of my friends' opinions on the series before I gave it the green light. General consensus amongst them was that the first half was very good whereas the\n          \n        second half was complete ass. Knowing that they were die-hard fans of the light novels, I can't help but think that their opinion on the first half was somewhat skewed towards the positive side due to how bad the second half was.\nSo as someone who has yet to watch the second half of the series, I hope that this review will be as unbiased as it could be.\nNow let's get right into it.\nI watched the series in a very weird order. I downloaded the whole series, not knowing it was sorted in the chronological order. I was 6 episodes in before I realised this and episode 6 was meant to be the mid-season finale. Safe to say that I completely ruined it for myself. So I recommend watching this in the release order.\nSuzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is almost an episodic like series depicting the lives of a few unique high school students who met through the SOS Brigade, a club Haruhi created. Beneath this is quite a significant supernatural element woven into the story, with Haruhi literally being the centre of the universe without her knowing it, almost analogous to being god in a sense.\nThe characters I feel are one of area that the series was a bit lacking in. They are unoriginal - you have Kyon, the calm, collected and witty protagonist; Haruhi, the egocentric, eccentric and sometimes arrogant female lead. Along with Asahina (moe girl), Nagato (loli/kuudere-ish girl) and Koizumi, whom I felt was pretty much there just so that the show doesn’t become a harem. The characters are nothing out of the ordinary, which is not necessarily a bad thing but it did made some parts fairly predictable. Character development is close to non-existent, but that is to be expected from an episodic SoL/comedy anime.\nHaruhi was definitely one hell of a character. It’s a love and hate relationship. She is ridiculously cute at times but most of the time I just found her to be annoying. The times when she practically made forced Asahina to whore herself out was particularly hard to watch. On the other hand I was very fond of Kyon, I really enjoyed his narration and the monologues when he just goes off in a tangent. The exchanges between Kyon and Haruhi were definitely some of the best parts about the anime, as it was interesting to see two polar opposite characters clash. The voice actor/actress for Kyon and Haruhi was on point at portraying their personalities.\nThe story itself was told in a non-linear fashion, which was one of the peculiarities of the series, adding a bit of mystery and suspense to it. The story was paced really nicely and quite interesting once you buy into the idea that everything revolves around Haruhi. There is a little dab of romance integrated into the story. The comedy was definitely well done. There were a few subtle references to other anime which I can’t help but chuckle at, and there were scenes that just made me burst out laughing.\nThe first episode was a rather odd one. It might seem off-putting to some even, but please do stick with it to the end. The episode was made to look goofy and I found the awkwardness of it pretty amusing.\nThere were a few things which I did not particularly like. Despite being only 14 episodes, there were 2 or 3 episodes which I felt was completely pointless. There was an obnoxious amount of fanservice and most of it was pretty cringe worthy. I felt like too much of the budget was spent on animating the asynchronous jiggling of Asahina’s chest.\nAs a hobby artist, I can say that the art in this series is excellent for an anime that is almost 10 years old. Animation and art quality is crisp and consistent throughout all the episodes. Character designs are generally good, but I feel that the size of the eyes relative to the rest of the facial features on the girls is a bit high for my liking, which made them look quite odd. However, this shouldn’t be a problem to most people.\nThere are anime which I sit through the OP or ED every single time, this was not one of them. The OP and ED are decent but is nothing to boast about. The other soundtracks are adequate and do the job just fine, but then again, I am not the kind of person who pays much attention to the music anyways. So I do apologise for not being able to offer much insight regarding the sound.\nOverall I have really enjoyed the series so far and will be watching the second half despite the amount of hate on it. I definitely recommend checking this out if you’re looking for something light-hearted to pass the time with.\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Haruhi Suzumiya is a light novel series authored by Nagaru Tanigawa which began in 2003 and is still in production. Naturally, a manga and anime version followed. I got introduced to Haruhi via the anime nearly three years ago, and I loved it enough to buy it on DVD, which is not something I can say for every anime I've seen. So, what do I make of Haruhi? Let's find out.\nStory:\nAn ordinary high school boy known only as Kyon leads a boring life. He is sarcastic, pessimistic, and basically seems disinterested in a lot of things in life. That was until he met a student\n          \n        in his class named Haruhi Suzumiya. Haruhi is WILDLY eccentric; she is bored of her life, makes strange demands, and behaves nothing like any of the other students at the school. She enters school clubs, only to quit them the next day. Kyon suggests to her that she start her own club, which she does, with gusto. She takes over the school's literature club and renames it, depending on what translation you're following, something to the effect of \"Spreading Joy with Haruhi Suzumiya\" or something. To make the club official, she must have at least five members. She forcibly makes Kyon, Yuki Nagato, the lone member of the literature club, a girl names Mikuru Asahina, and a transfer student names Itsuki Koizumi join.\nOh, but that's not the beginning of it. It turns out that Yuki is an alien \"data entity\" sent to observe Haruhi. Mikuru is a time traveler from the future who has also come to observe Haruhi. Itsuki is an esper who, you guessed it, has also been sent to observe Haruhi. Why? Because Haruhi has the ability to alter reality by merely wishing it; however, she is not aware of this. She can't be made aware of this, nor can she know about the backgrounds of Mikuru, Yuki, and Itsuki, yet they dump this information on Kyon, the only \"normal\" one of the bunch. Looks like Kyon's life isn't boring anymore.\nThis is a weird, WEIRD series. Even by Japanese standards, this is weird. However, it is also brilliant. What initially pulled me in was the humor; this was the first anime I ever saw that made me laugh my ass off. Part of its appeal is making fun of cliches of Japanese pop culture, and to see a show make fun of the things I have become tired of seeing in anime, yeah, that interested me. But it's not just a comedy, it's a mystery series, too. There are elements of romance and drama, most of which is properly executed. I will warn you though, you need to be knowledgeable of Japanese pop culture, because if you're not, you're going to be lost. Also, the anime cuts out some details from the novels as well. Nonetheless, the first season is well done in this regard. 9/10.\nArt:\nThis is the first series by KyoAni I saw, and I was not disappointed. The backgrounds are nice, the character designs are nice, and the animation is really fluid for a tv series. There's not much here that already been said, but Haruhi is indeed a feast for the eyes. 9/10.\nSound:\nHaruhi is probably the closest I've ever seen an anime be like a musical. There are several vocal songs in the soundtrack, some of which are performed in-universe, and they are all superb. The instrumental tracks are great, too. Some of them are eccentric sounding, others are sweeping orchestras, but the soundtrack is amazing.\nAs is the voice-acting. Okay, I'm gonna draw a lot of controversy by saying this, but it needs to be said. If you have the option to see Haruhi in either English or Japanese, watch it in English. Why? Two words: Crispin Freeman. He. IS. Kyon. Do NOT try to convince me otherwise. It is, to this day, my favorite performance of his. (Yes, I just said Crispin Freeman as Kyon is better than his performance of Alucard.) Not only that, some other characters, like The Computer Club President, and Ryoko Asakura, (Bridget Hoffman's voice is sooooo pretty!) also sound better. On the other hand, some characters, like Haruhi, sound slightly better in Japanese, but only slightly. However, there are reasons why I consider Bandai and Bang Zoom to be the best English dubbers in the business, and this show is one of those reasons. 10/10.\nCharacters:\nHaruhi is eccentric. She can be mean-spirited, selfish, and unable to weigh in consequences, but she can also be very reflective, and even, as the title suggests, melancholic. But she's not the main star; Kyon is. He is on my list of favorite anime characters for a reason. Most of the humor is courtesy of him. He frequently narrates, and often snarks in a deadpan manner of the life and situations around him. But he's still very complex, and very human at the same time. Most of the other characters are either anime stereotypes taken in a deconstructive direction, or minor characters who only contribute comic relief. I like most of the other characters, particularly Yuki. However, I have one complaint, and that's Mikuru. Remember in my reviews of Kanon and Clannad, I said I like moe girls, but only if they had more to their personality than helplessness? Unfortunately, Mikuru is completely helpless. It gets annoying to see someone unable to stand up for herself and cry at the drop of a hat, even though she's at least in her teens, and can move through time. And, this is just personal, but even though in-universe she's made out to be this adorable beauty of a girl, I . . . don't really find her all that cute. But that's just me; I don't despise any character in this show, and I understand that Haruhi is spoofing moeblobs, so I can let it slide. Overall, this casts gels together very well, but it's Kyon who makes it memorable. 9/10.\nEnjoyment:\nIf you know anything about anime that has come out in the last ten or so years, you're gonna like Haruhi. Not only does it poke holes at countless plot devices, it somehow plays them straight at the same time, and in an entertaining fashion. It was the outstanding humor that drew me in (and the baseball episode remains one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life), but I found so much more to like. For example, there is a scene in episode 6 (chronological order) that was simply magical; I have no other way to describe it. There are some genuinely heartwarming moments in this series, in spite of the zaniness. All that to a great soundtrack, and you can see why I like this so much. I used to list Haruhi as my third favorite anime series of all time way back in the day. There are just two things you need to be aware of. One: don't watch it in the anarchic broadcast order, unless you want to be lost. Two, like I said, you need to know about anime to understand this. If you don't know about moe girls, the \"mysterious transfer student\" cliche, the \"ordinary school boy gets drawn into fantastic adventures!\" cliche, and so forth, you will be completely lost. If those aren't a problem, you just might like it, maybe even more than I do! 9/10.\nI have yet to see the second season, and I have yet to see the movie, but I am looking forward to the movie's eventual (fingers crossed) English release. Also, I need to read the original light novels, and not just the sample chapters online either, but I'm lazy like that.\nLastly; the dance. It is made of win.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu or The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzuyima is a classic slice of life anime. It follows the life of Suzumiya but is told from the perspective of a one of her male classmates, Kyon. Out of sheer boredom and some unknowing motivation from Kyon,  Suzuyima creates the SOS Brigade in order to basically amuse her. The SOS Brigade has one goal and that is to find aliens, time-travlers, and espers, which coincidentally are the type of people that join the group.\nstory-5\nThe plot is minimal and just like all other slice of life animes. The one difference that actually sets this one\n          \n        apart from others is that it wasn't shown in chronological order, the original broadcast order was jumbled, and it lead with an episode that could be either very appealing or completely turn you off from finishing the series. The actual chronological order of the episodes is 2, 3, 5, 10, 13, 14, 4, 7, 6, 8, 1, 12, 11, 9. The disarray of the series helps to keep it interesting but also serves to hide the fact that there is little plot.\nArt-8\nThe actual quality of the art was as usual very good. I wouldn't exactly brag about it but Kyoto has done good work and maintained their reputation.\nSound-7\nWhile watching, I didn't tend to notice the background sound which for me is a good thing. This meant is was fluid and went well with the episode without any problems standing out. The opening theme was good, nothing too special but matched the limited plot fairly well. The outro was a fun little dance, admittedly I enjoyed it. :)\ncharacter-7\nThe characters in my opinion were developed well in one season. There were strong relationships built between the characters that weren't exactly obviously seen. The downfall of the characters is the originality, it's the same type of characters that every anime has. You have your laid back main character, a high energy female counter role, an shy/embarrassed attractive girl, a silent character, and someone who is ridiculously nice and accommodating. While not original, I still enjoyed them, I like these sets of characters otherwise I wouldn't watch this genre of anime.\nEnjoyment-9\nAs I've said before, I really did enjoy the season even with its major flaws. I like to watch the unrealistic interactions between people and you definitely get that in Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu. It's quick paced and exciting, but if you don't enjoy random humor then this is not for you.\nOverall-7\nAs far as Slice of life goes this is in the top 3 most popular series I've heard of. I liked it's almost random episodes even with the confusion on the plot. It does what it should and it does it well. A very enjoyable series with not much to complain about.\n        "},

In fact, I knew really nothing about the whole subject till only a few weeks ago.\nIn short, I discovered the Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya by complete luck one day.  A friend of mine showed me the Hare Hare Yukai song, and I just started listening to it continually because it was fun and catchy.  One day, I just said to myself \"What's this anime all about?\", and so, I decided to watch it.\nI have to say, I didn't even know what I was missing.

This ainme was like a gateway drug for me; literally opening up a door that will hopefully lead to more great anime in the future.\nI truly enjoyed it, and sincerely recommend it.

It’s about a guy name Kyon, who is living a rather ordinary life, and he accepts the fact that nothing interesting happens to him, until he met Haruhi Suzumiya. \nNow Haruhi, is not your average person, she is trying to find fun in life, and since none of the clubs at the school suit her peculiar personality, and with Kyon springing the idea unintentionally to her unintentionally, she goes on to form a club with Kyon and a few other\n          \n        people. Known as the ‘Spreading Excitement all Over the World with Suzumiya Haruhi Brigade’ or the SOS Brigade for short.\nNow even the club members don’t know what the club does, but Haruhi states that their goal is to find Aliens, Time Travellers and Espers, how to do that one does not know, but they are closer than you think.\nCharacters - 8/10\nHaruhi Suzumiya is the beautiful, smart, athletic high school student, but behind that she is rather eccentric. She believes in Aliens, Time travellers and Espers, and because of her weird beliefs many people tend to avoid her, leaving her be, except Kyon for whatever reason. She is the God of world able to bring it to an end, if she gets bored. Twist is, she doesn’t know she’s a god, because if she was to find out, she could bring the world to a reset, if she wanted to.\nOur Alien/Cyborg no personality character is Yuki Nagato. Despite looking like a regular girl, and a quiet and monotone one at that, the reason behind this is she actually an Alien/Cyborg created by the ‘Data Integration Thought Entity.’ An organization outer space who observes different parts of the Galaxy, and Yuki’s job by them is to observe Haruhi. Yuki is actually the only member of the SOS Brigade who can use her power willingly when she wants to, to mostly to save the other characters from certain situations. \nThe fan service and moe club member Mikuru Asahina. Mikuru is actually from the future, hence she is the Time Traveller. Despite being from the future, she is really vulnerable, her character is often sexually harassed by Haruhi because she is just there for eye candy, and used as jail bait. She is sent from the future to observe Haruhi as something happened in the future because of the past, what that is classified. \nThe esper of the group is Itsuki Koizumi, your good looking male character of the series. He’s a transfer student, who Haruhi abducts to join the group because it’s Mysterious being a transfer student. He works for organization known as ‘The Organization’ basically a group of espers trained to fight these beings in what they call a closed space, which is the only place where he can use he’s powers. He’s job is to prevent Haruhi from destroying the world, and therefor trying to keep her happy.\nAnd I think we had enough of supernatural characters, so we have our ordinary and main character Kyon. The only thing weird about him is that he is never given a real name throughout the series, he's just known as Kyon which is a nickname. He really has no motivation as to why he’s in the group, he just got himself into that situation and starts to get use to his whacky adventures. Kyon gets full control of this series as he does the narration, usually something relating outside of the series, which relates to the storyline.\nNow all the characters kind of disagree with each other, other than Kyon, who sort of agrees with everyone, except Haruhi. However all their goals are the same, it’s just the method they choose they disagree on, because they’re all from different organizations. But their main goal is to keep Haruhi in the dark on who she really is, to prevent her from destroying the entire world, and Kyon is key to all their plans.\nAnimation - 8/10\nNow the animation is really good, originally being released in 2006 and a 2nd season released in 2009. You can see the change in art style, even though it’s not that much difference you can still see the difference. It has a rather clean art style, as in everything is animated very well, even the background, everything new is animated. And the lighting is very good as well, it really fits each character individually when they are focused, and the scenes when a lot things are happening is well animated, it doesn’t feel like anything is repeating. However I’m not a huge fan, when the supernatural beings they’re facing becomes an obvious 3D rendering, in such a beautiful 2D world. \nEnjoyment - 10/10\nIt’s hard to describe Haruhi, because it fulfils so many different genres. But because it covers so many genres, I think that’s what makes its enjoyable, it has a little be of something for everyone. There is no definitive storyline, it’s because of the way the characters are set out, there is room for many different kind of adventures. \nOne part of the show which I didn’t really enjoy about the show was the Endless Eight Arc, which was the same story happening for each episode. Each episode is animated differently, but it was the same thing all the time, which was a chore to watch over again. If you watch, Endless Eight and don’t want to sit through all 8 Episodes of the same just watch Part 1,4,8. For a start, middle and end.\nThe music is pretty good as well. Most notably season 1 ending theme, which you can learn to dance to. Also sometime in the series where Haruhi is playing in a band, that scene was beautifully animated and the song was well done as well.\nI recommend watching it in chronological order and finishing off with the movie, because it’s a pretty damn good movie. Because the last episode ‘Someday in the Rain’ was pretty meh. \nVerdict\nHaruhi is a great series for fans of anime. It pretty much has a little bit of every genre for everyone. It’s mostly a Slice of Life, but because of how the characters are made and developed, the story can go to a variety of places. \n9/10"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I watched the show in chronological order so I had to figure out which episode was on Season 1 so I don't spoil the second season. This is, honestly, one of the best and extremely hilarious Slice-of-Life-ish anime I've ever seen. \n\n[Story]: (9/10)\nOn the first day of high school, a beautiful girl named Haruhi Suzumiya introduces herself as having \"no interest in ordinary humans\". She asks for any aliens, time travelers, or espers to join her. Watching her weird behavior is Kyon who sits in front of Haruhi. Kyon unwittingly gives Haruhi an idea to start her own after school club. Thereafter Kyon and several\n          \n        others find themselves dragged, literally, into the Save our world by Overloading it with fun Suzumiya Haruhi's Brigade or S.O.S Brigade for short. \nThank God, I didn't watch the show in airing order. I recently found out that the first episode of this series is the short film made by Haruhi, a (crappy) magical girl film with Asahina starring as the main protagonist. Since I watched the show in chronological order, I saw Haruhi's film after seeing them produce it behind the scenes. I can only imagine what people thought when they first saw that film. Some people might think it's a weird episode but I thought it was the funniest episode in the series. Seeing their acting, Kyon's narration, the \"commericials\",etc..I was literally crying in laughter. Then the real \"first\" episode came which was the second episode in the airing order.\nAs you already know, the show is not aired in chronological order. The final episode of the first season is actually the final episode of the series. The second episode of the first season is actually the first episode of the series. I am completely aware that the series is meant to be viewed out of chronological order because of the overarching plot line. However, I didn't want to because I recently just watched an anime that I viewed in non-chronological order. While the airing order had much better pacing and better character development for Haruhi.  The chronological order was easier to understand and flows smoothly. Either way, viewing it in whatever order does not provide you an advantage. \nYou might think that this is just a typical slife-of-life anime but it's not. Some \"Mystery\" plot points are also involved here. Haruhi mentioned that she was looking for an esper, alien and time traveller. At first, I thought this girl was crazy. Then the 4th, 5th, and 6th episode came which pretty much confirmed their existence. Then we find out about the world that they're living in and the how Haruhi is a God or something. I'm just as confused as Kyon here.. While I don't want to spoil the entire series for you, all I'll say is the story is really not that hard to follow. It may seem confusing but it's not if you listen and watch the episodes. The story is basically in the title. Melancholy means depressed or sad. The characters are basically there to cheer her up. Not exactly but you'll get what I mean if you watch the show. \nLook, it's not the story that you should be mostly focused on about in this show because the story is simple and nothing complicated or dark. It's the damn characters and the extremely hilarious moments. Unless you don't have a sense of humor, the show will make you laugh, the show will make you laugh in tears and the show will make you laugh your guts out. Compared to other comedy shows I've watched, the comedy here is used differently and something fresh. It uses parodies as a joke, use some of the character tropes as a joke. In short, it's one of the funniest animes I've ever seen and this is coming from a guy who watches a lot of comedy shows so my sense of humor is one of the best. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\nI just couldn't believe that this anime was made in 2006 until I've seen the same released dates from 6 different websites. Compared to other 2006 anime animations out there, this is THE best one I've seen. From bright and colourful environments to well designed characters. This is by, no doubt, a perfect score when it comes to animation. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Sound]: (9/10)\nI don't know if I should bump the score up for my sound category or leave it as 9. Wanna know why? It's Haruhi's band performance which is \"God Knows\" and \"Lost my music\". I watched the show in English Dub, meaning that the song is also in English. \"God Knows\" sounds terrible in English and \"Lost my music\" is, in my opinion, better than the Japanese version and \"God Knows\". I obviously listened to the Japanese version of both songs and I only like \"God Knows\". I didn't really like the second song in Japanese. \nThe OP theme song is \"Bouken Desho Desho\" by Aya Hirano and the ED theme song is \"Hare Hare Yukai\" by Aya Hirano, Minori Chihara, and Yuko Goto. The OP song sounded decent but the ED theme song.....I love it. Even the visuals for the ED is hilarious. \nI watched the show in English Dub so I'm reviewing the English VA. They all sound great, especially Haruhi and Asahina. Haruhi's VA has that  \"energetic\" and \"alive\" voice that fit her voice with Haruhi. Asahina's VA has that typical \"moe\" voice. In other words, that high-squeaky voice that I somehow didn't find annoying. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Characters]: (9/10)\nWhat makes the show extremely great? It's Haruhi, Haruhi, Haruhi. It's Haruhi Suzumiya. What makes her great? It's her personality, of course. Man, at first, I hated Haruhi but overtime, I eventually grew to loving her character. I completely love Haruhi's action. She has this personality of \"I get what I want and no one will get in my way\". Rules? Teachers? Morals? Other character's feeling, especially Asahina's feelings? Pfft, that ain't going to stop her. She will do everything to get things done, in her own way. Hell, she even harasses Asahina most of the time. And by harassing, I mean, sexually harassing her. She forces Asahina to dress this cute \"moe\" clothes which is one of the funny things about this show. Just by reading that sentence, you'll think that I'm \"that guy\" that likes to see girls sexually harassed but nope. Watch the show and you'll understand. \nAnother character that makes this show hilarious is the protagonist named \"Kyon\" which is not his real name, but rather, his nickname has an opposite personality compared to Haruhi. He has a dull attitude and a personality that may deem him as....boring. However, his hilarious sarcasms and hilarious monologues is what makes him extremely funny. Both Haruhi and Kyon will definitely go into my \"Favorite Characters\" list. \nThere's also another 3 main characters which is Yuki Nagato, Mikuru Asahina, and Itsuki Koizumi. Yuki is your typical silent character, Asahina is the moe type girl and Itsuki is the cocky, rich-transfer student. These guys might have a cliched personality but the show uses that to make funny moments. Anyways, these characters are not normal and there is something different with these characters. That's the best I can say without really spoiling who they are.  \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\nWhat do you get when have an extremely funny casts of characters? An enjoyable anime...That was horrible, I should leave. \nAnyways, I really enjoyed this anime. Haruhi is one of the most funniest characters I've seen and this is why I enjoyed this anime. Is there really anymore to say?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[OVERALL]: (9.3/10)\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is one of the best animes out there. If you haven't watched it then you're completely missing out. It has a simple story, a cast of likable characters, outstanding animation for its time, and a lot of unforgettable funny moments that will make you laugh in tears. Don't let the word \"Melancholy\" fool you because this show ain't depressing or sad. It's cheerful and funny. While the show has a few flaws like an anti-climactic ending, it's still a great show and I recommend you that you watch it. If you're looking for a romantic series or a story with a serious tone then this is not for you. \n\nPros:\n+Great Story\n+Outstanding Animation for its time\n+Great Soundtrack\n+Great Band Performance by Haruhi\n+Great and Likable Characters\n+Extremely Hilarious Moments\n+Kyon's sarcasm and monologues\n+Haruhi's odd personality that makes her unique\nCons:\n-Anti-climactic Ending\n        "},

I should get over my fear my writing some to it.\nIt's like The Beatles, Star Wars, The Rolling Stones or Woody Allen movies. Over-fokin-rated. Fo wat? I mean ok, nice visuals and smoothly bouncing tiddies thanks to KyoAni but the rest smells like trash.\nTrash got me hooked tho, guilty pleasure thing like HiddenLol browsing.\nHaruhi has sadistic tendecies towards anything that specifies as breathing, hence considered God, I mean think about it. Or just hormones, idk. Kyon has Stockholme's syndrome for bearing her and no he ain't tryna\n          \n        get her laid so this motivation doesn't even justify his clinging onto her. The esper dude was just there to fill a chair for the \"Finding E.T.\" Club, red-haired girl existed just for inducing boners to Kyon and Nagato just to undo his boner, if you see her you'll feel likewise.\nThe story relvolving around these chars is a what if one placed a hidden camera into this club and monitor what happens. Nothing special but nothing to be hated about either, I fell for the fun parts maybe perhaps I like slice of life animu.\nBut.\nTHE ENDLESS EIGHT WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA. It was a debase against the budget given for the animenification of it, filling 4 eps with repeating bullcrap, which bullcrap they copypasta'd to the first 10 eps of the 2nd season. Advice: Do your self a favor and skip away to ep.10 to the last 5 mins in case you do.\nDo watch the movie of that tho, was worth. Not the Nagato spin off tho, vibe there was killed, their animu eyez just aren't the same.\nBye.\n        "},

I belong to the latter. This series is overrated, infuriating and suffocating. You'd get the same value by looking at a angled photo of a starbucks coffee.\nStory:\nIt has an interesting concept, but that isn't really the focus of this series. It's a pity, it could have been a deep, challenging plot, but at the end of the day, it's only some annoying brats+girl with boobs running in circles. And it seemed so unfitting for the style, the characters, the everything. Sometimes, series can make this\n          \n        problem intriguing and refreshing, the bad matchup adding to the entertainment. This is not the case. Sci-Fi is not random events happening with a wibbly wobbly timey wimey explanation half heartedly stuck on. It does not work like that. \nArt:\nIt's a pretty picture to look at, animation's nice. I liked it a good deal.\nSound: \nGood, nothing very special. It serves its purpose and has some nice points. It doesn't rise above, but it certainly isn't awful.\nCharacters:\nOhgod. To make things simple, let's split this into three categories. Haruhi, Kyon and the rest.\nHaruhi: Loud, obnoxious and \"hot\", this girl has a cult following. Her personality is so unlikable that I would like to put a dartboard to her face. The way she acts begs somebody to backhand her  or SOMETHING. No such person exists. Kyon and Co. are too busy tiptoeing around her to make sure she doesn't blow something up. One scene tried to make us sympathize with her, but it didn't do anything because it somehow made her seem immature and incapable. Her \"quirks\" aren't cute, nor do they make her any more compelling. Haruhi is only selfish and made out to be better than she is.\nKyon: I like him. He's a normal, albiet horny teenager that's satisfied with is position in life. No depressing backstories or lifelong goals. And possibly the one person who's able to take Haruhi's BS without any ulterior motives. Unfortunately, this means all he will do is whine, complain and watch Mikuru's big-boobied goodness.\nThe rest: Fanservice and plot devices. I don't have to go into detail because if you've seen them all. And the fact that they all seem to have some creepy crush on Kyon.\nEnjoyment:\nLittle to none. If you examined this like you would The Old Man and the Sea, then maybe you would find some meaning, but don't be surprised if you come up empty handed. \nI re-watched the series and I really tried to like it. Honestly. But I couldn't see why it's so highly regarded. I don't recommend this anime, and it doesn't deserve all the hype it got.\n        "},

It blends together so many genres and manages to pull each one off perfectly.

I gave Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu a 9/10 because I had to be realistic: was this anime everything I had dreamed of? No, it wasn't. But it was so close to it. Many people probably didn't like it as much as I did, and I understand that, but I will always have a spot in my heart for this show. Now onto the review!\nStory 8/10\nThis portion of the review gets an eight of ten, because of the mere fact that there was not a third season. I was delighted\n          \n        to know that Haruhi got a second season, and even a movie! But I wanted more. I wanted to know exactly what happened if Haruhi were to find out about her powers, and everything after that. The plot was outstanding in my eyes, but it lacked...something. That something might have been more depth. Yes, the story and plot was as detailed as can be, and extraordinary, and complicated, and amazing! But still, there were many stories that were introduced once and never touched again. I wanted to find out more about these what if's! Not going to lie, I was a little bummed out to finish this series and not find out just a little more about each of these characters' lives outside of school. \nArt 10/10\nIn my opinion, the art was completely beautiful. I'm not really going to go super into detail in this section of the review because everyone has different opinions, and not everyone is going to agree with me in my opinion that the moe style was amazing. \nSound 10/10\nThis is such a big deal to me and I have no clue why. I just really enjoy a good opening, a good soundtrack, and a good ending song. This had all of it. Both intros were so enjoyable, and catchy, I was humming along with every episode! The soundtrack was good as well, which means, it set a mood. When I heard each soundtrack, I was taken to the world of Haruhi. It was nice.\nCharacter 9/10\nHad it not been for Mikuru, I would have given this section a whopping 10/10. All of the characters(except Mikuru :p) were amazing and unique. A lot of people don't like Haruhi because of her annoying tendencies, but that just made me love her even more.I loved Haruhi's character because she wasn't your typical protagonist. Haruhi showed that not every female character is cute and likable. I thought that Haruhi was unique and quirky. Kyon was also a fun character to have around. He was the sarcastic guy, but in some lights, he was kind-hearted and put up with Haruhi's trouble. All in all, none of these characters bothered me enough to quit watching the show, and honestly I didn't like Mikuru 99% because of her English voice actor. That being said, voice acting is also a huge factor on whether I watch the show or not. A lot of the times, I watch anime in Japanese with subtitles because the English dubs are so intolerable. I'm going to make a new category for \"Voice Acting\", because it is a key detail in my ratings for animes. (P. S. I guess that voice acting would typically go under the category of \"sound\" but when I think of sound I think of music, and I think Voice Acting, for me at least, should have it's own section because it's important...to me)\n\nVoice Acting 9/10\nI have a lot of problems with English voice actors. So many times do I quit watching an anime in English JUST because the voice actor will take on that role of high pitched cute girl sound, because they think they have too. I was surprised that I actually enjoyed all the voices, except Mikuru's. There we go again with the voice actor overdoing it. All in all, the voices were exceptionally good. \nEnjoyment 10/10\nI enjoyed every single moment of this show, from Kyon's sassy remarks, to the Endless Eight. The spirit this anime had was incredible and I want more!!\nOverall 9/10 \nI adored this!"},

Although I sat through the entire show and did enjoy it, I have to say that at the end I was left with questions. I wanted more out of Haruhi. Needless to say, I was just a tad dissapointed at how the whole thing turned out. In my book, Haruhi isn't bad, but its not all that impressive either.\nStory: As stated, its a funny mix of supernatural and school life. It follows the\n          \n        adventures of 5 high school students as they do...stuff. Yeah that pretty much sums it up. On their trek to find aliens, time travelers, espers, and other supernatural beings they end up doing...stuff. This stuff includes, but is not limited to: Playing baseball, going on vacation to a deserted island, donning risque bunny costumes, combing the city for aliens, etc. etc. Occassionally we see the supernatural elements come in to play, such as when Itsuki reveals his esper powers, or when a closed space invades some poor saps room, but these elements are few and far. I feel like they could have done so much more in this area. I mean, you have an alien, a time traveler, an epser, and a pseudo god all in one school club. They could have done SO MUCH with this and made Haruhi so much more interesting. They could have expanded on the character's backstories to make them more interesting or have them show off their powers more. Hell, if they wanted to focus more on the \"school life\" of the series, couldn't we have at least gotten some character development? But alas, the story falls flat of being interesting in its supernatural or slice of life aspect. 6/10\nArt and Sound: No complaints here. Each character is unique and attractive, the backgrounds are well done and colorful. The opening and ending theme are both catchy (Admit it, you tried the dance at least once when no one was looking). Insert songs are ok. 8/10\nCharacter: Characters don't get much development in this series. For the most part they just stay the same. Which is a shame, because they all have some kind of interesting appeal, but that appeal won't hold up forever throughout the story. Yuki's enigmatic nature will eventually stop being cool, Mikuru's squeals and expressions are only cute for so long, and so on...I would have loved to see them grow a little. 6/10\nEnjoyment: I did like this show despite its shortcomings. I really did. It made me laugh a few times and it kept me entertained for all 14 episodes. Since I own the DVDs I have rewatched the series many times whenever I'm in the mood for some mindless fun. But I can't help but feel that they could have expanded so much more on the story, atmosphere and characters in this show. The series just falls short in almost all aspects. 7/10\n        "},

Minor spoilers are also ahead!*\nConvincingly and effectively scrambling sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, mystery, romance, and Japanese high-school drama, this chimeric series revolves around one Haruhi Suzumiya--a goddess who doesn't realize that she's a goddess. She can break worlds and make them, advance the seasons, give animals the ability to talk, and awaken mysterious powers in others. The catch is is that because she doesn't realize that she can do any of this her powers activate on a completely subconscious level, so that the supernatural activity that swirls around\n          \n        her is directly tied to her mood. The happier and more content she is, the better off the world is. If she's bored, anxious, or depressed, however, dark things awaken, and the fate of the universe hangs in the balance. Perhaps I should mention too that she's a hyperactive, manipulative, self-centered brat who has no social graces and little respect for others? It falls to Kyon, a regular high-school boy and the narrator, to assist three other high-school students (all decidedly less regular then him) in keeping Haruhi's tremendous abilities under check--which means, essentially, that they must willingly be her toys, and keep her entertained in any way that they possibly can. And the more they let her get away with, the harder she pushes...\nIf this sounds frustrating to watch, it can be occasionally. But the team behind it do an amazing job of subverting expectations and bending anime formula to their own needs. The technical ability on display here is occasionally astounding, and the team's willingness to (hilariously) skewer anime stereotypes and experiment with the form (I would not be surprised if season 2 lost this show half of its fans) keeps it fresh for far longer than it has any right to be, especially considering the awkward pacing on display throughout. The climax of the two seasons, for instance, literally occurs before the first season is even halfway through. What should be the climactic episode of season 1 is instead a mostly quiet look at what a normal day looks like when Haruhi is keeping herself entertained. (Of course, you could watch these episodes in the order in which they were originally aired, which fixes the pacing issues but introduces others.) Season 2 is perhaps the bravest thing I've ever seen that was actually aired on television--I don't want to give away anything, but the financiers must have been insane to allow this to air and think that there would be no fan backlash. Not to mention that Season 2 doesn't follow the first season chronologically--its episodes actually interleave with the happenings of the first season. \nWhat redeems this series (assuming none of the above sounds appealing--I found it to be refreshing) are the characters. Their trajectories (or at least, Kyon's, Haruhi's, and Yuki's)  here give whole new meaning to the words 'character development,' and, like the cast of Cowboy Bebop, for example, you're not going to forget their names after you've left them. Even Haruhi will work her way into your heart--resist her all you want. She is unstoppable--and a goddess, besides. I should mention that if you're looking for closure from the series, you're not going to get it. Indeed, the series seems largely to have been an extended setup for the 2010 film, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. This would have been a legitimately great time-travel movie if it were capable of standing alone, however, it necessarily leans on the events and character development of the series in order to function--but function beautifully it does. (In spite of running nearly three hours in length!) \nIt largely avoids the comedy of the series, and instead focuses on a single mysterious event that strands Kyon in a world without Haruhi, and where his closest friends no longer recognize him. The surprises and twists that unfold are genuinely surprising and occasionally moving, and if you're not grinning around that lump in your throat by the time it concludes then there's something wrong with you. Be sure to stick around after the credits, as well. \nIn sum: this is a *great* series. I've been having extraordinary luck with anime recently--typically when I go on an anime binge I mow through a few false-starts and find maybe one movie or series worth hanging onto, if I'm lucky. My recent adventures in anime land have been extremely rewarding however, and have rekindled my love for the form. For me personally, Haruhi stands with the greats.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is, as of the time of me writing this, my favorite anime series of all time. Maybe I'm a little biased in saying this, since this show means a lot to me on a personal level, so I'm going to try to write this without any of those personal biases in the way.\nNow for some people, the appeal of Haruhi may not be very clear, and I wouldn't blame somebody for not liking the show. What the series does is it plays around with tropes. It doesn't deconstruct or subverse them, it just embraces anime cliches and parodies them simply\n          \n        by doing that. \nThe characters, on a surface level, seem cliche to the fullest. The big breasted moe character (Mikuru Asahina), the Rei Ayanami cash-in (Yuki Nagato), and the nice guy (Itsuki Koizumi). However, the characters are more than just those cliches, with Mikuru being a time traveler, Yuki being an alein, and Itsuki being an esper, coincidentally enough, all being what the character the series is named after, Haruhi Suzumiya, is interested in. The protagonist is Kyon, whose role is simply the straight man, and is also extremely snarky, sometimes narrating the events going on and adding some self-awareness to some moments that seem really stupid and cliche, which makes it funny for me.\nThe animation has that Kyoto Animation touch to it, where the character movement looks pretty real. Sure, its not Akira level or anything like that, but still looks pretty damn fine. There is also some nice detail added to the background settings, making the world feel alive. \nThe art-style is nothing new, it looks like what you think of when you hear the word \"anime\", but I think that adds more to how the series plays with tropes. The directing is great, there are some angles that are unlike anything I've seen. One scene in particular stands out to me, where there isn't any actual animation (Or so I assume), but rather something actually being filmed with a filter added to it, which I think is pretty neat. \nOverall, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a truly unique series, and its unlike anything I've ever seen with what it does. I rewatched this fearing it wouldn't be as good as I remember, but those fears have been expelled after I finished watching it. I don't think the series is for everybody, especially if you aren't a fan of slice of life anime or just aren't too familiar with anime, but if you enjoy the slice of life genre, or if you just want something unique, this is the show for you. Now I can only pray to Haruhi that we'll get a third season of this show.\n        "},

Well, the story was fine but the character with the bitchy personality called Haruhi Suzumiya pissed me off. Ever since, I hated everything about the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise. 1 year have passed since then. I kept watching many anime and eventually became a fan of 2 awsome voice actors - Sugita Tomokazu (Kyon) and Ouno Daisuke (Koizumi). When I learned that both of them were main characters of Haruhi Suzumiya series, I couldn't but watch the anime out of respect for them.\n.\nI\n          \n        didn't make a wrong decision. Factually speaking, Kyon (Sugita Tomokazu) is the point of view character of this anime. The whole story is what he narrated, from what he saw and experienced. Although the title may suggest the anime is all about Haruhi, she is only for making up the background. For example, Attack on Titans (Shingeki no Kyojin) is set on the setting where the story revolves around the Titans. When actually they are only for backgrond purpose. If you think of the anime this way, you may be able to suppress your irritation for the \"kuso ama\" Haruhi and even enjoy it!\n.\nThink of this anime titled as The Monologue of Kyon and you will be fine.\n.\n|| Story - 6 ||\n~\nThe story is totally bizarre. The bizarrity is hard to overlook, but do try. Think of it as Kyon is writing a novel using his fantasy and reading out loud.\n.\n|| Art - 7 ||\n~\nThe art is your typical Kyoto studios and great.\n.\n|| Sound - 8 ||\n~\nVoice acting has become for me the most important factor for judging any anime. This anime is one of the best if you ONLY consider voice acting. I may be a Haruhi hater from head to toe, but I admit the voice her, Hirano Aya, is one hell of an actress. Needless to praise Tomokazu Sugita or Ouno Daisuke, they rule the anime universe.\n.\nThe background and OST were fine, but the OPs and EDs were BAD.\n.\n|| Enjoyment - 6 ||\n~\nIt's very hard to enjoy an anime where a character with a bitchy personality runs wild. But, if you follow the TIPs I mentioned, like thinking the anime is about Kyon or Kyon is writing a fantasy novel, it is possible to extract some enjoyment out of it.\n.\n|| Overall - 7||\n~\nIf you are not a fan of Tomokazu Sugita or Ouno Daisuku, I don't think you can keep up with this anime. The chances are high that you might be irritated to death. and curse anyone who ever said anything good about this.\n        "},

Good, now imagine all the sitting around doing nothing but having cake and tea replaced with a bunch of zany supernatural scenarios presented in a fashion equally mundane as having cake and tea. Then imagine a couple of the moeblobs have been replaced with male characters. And some of the innocent cuteness replaced with stuff that's a little bit more ecchi.\nThat, my friends, is The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya in a nutshell.\nThe art an animation is quite good, and if the moe style appeals to you, you'll love it.\nHaving only watched it dubbed, I will say that the VAs were pretty good. The\n          \n        only thing I didn't really care for was Mikuru's constant crying, which got on my nerves somewhat. But Mikuru Beam made up for it, to a certain degree.\nThe plot, as I said, has a feeling of mundaneness to it despite the supernatural nuttiness that occasionally rears its head. It's just a bunch of mildly amusing events that occur because of Haruhi's god-like status, none of which have any real significance otherwise.\nSo overall, Haruhi's escapades are entertaining enough to be watchable, but ultimately she's nothing truly special... at least as far as Melancholy goes. I've yet to see the critically acclaimed Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya which, if it turns out to be as good as everybody says, might be a good enough reason to watch this mostly unremarkable show.\nAnd just to be clear, this is a review for the whole 28-episode affair, since I don't really consider what's commonly referred to as the \"2nd season\" to be a legitimate second season since they're intermixed with the episodes of \"1st season\". A second season would be a sequel (or prequel), but in this case it's more of an extended director's cut of the first season.\n        "},

I started watching the series back mabey a year or so ago and at first, I thought is was good. So I bought the dvds and watch it again. Wow, I was wrong.\nStory: Ok, what? Call me stupid but I really did not get the gist of it all until the second time around. I got the aliens, and the espers and all that, but on that sixth episode, they sorta lost me. I would have to say, too much talking. They talked so much and all told Kyon the same thing pretty much,\n          \n        blah blah blah. And even after all that talking, there really was no point! They were there to observe her, yes I get it, just say it once.\nHaruhi is hardly even part of anything. If anything, she just starts some plot every episode, yuki explains it and everything gets fixed. The filler episodes are more interesting than the first six!!\nAnd people told me that this anime wasn't like all the rest.\nI will agree that The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is different from al the rest, and better than your average anime however, it's no big deal.\nCharacters:\nCan you say Mary-sue?!I can.\nHaruhi: the only worth while character to pay attention, and she hardly does anything except yell and kick kyon around. \nKyon: the only character that devolops at all. I'm serious.\nYuki: Mary-sue no.1. Can do anything, again, I'm serious. She's the cute megane character, who is an alien.Nothing phases her, and she can use 'alien magic' to change the weather, create planes, get home runs, ect.\nMikuru: Mary-sue no.2. large-breasted, maid-uniformed, squealing time traveler with pony tails and a happy-to-oblige attatuide. Jeez, these guys used all their imagination on this one. Did I meantion her bust?!\nItsuki: This guy is actually slightly original! Thumbs up! Itsuki is more of a catalyst character than anything (I think they're all supposed to be catalyst characters) but what he says, actually seems to matter. His personality seems quite passive, so he can fall into the background, espcially since he's a guy (and this anime is full with wide-eyed girls in short skirts) which is reather dissapointing.\nSound:\nGood lord do I hate the voice actors for this anime. Haruhi borke my ears drums while Yuki was just TOO flat. Mikurus voice actor suited her perfectly,unfortunatly enough. I have to say, it leaves alot to be desired.\nThe opening song is ok, but nothing amazing, while the ending will almost only be famous for it's dnace. Did you know there are version of ALL THE GIRLS from the anime singing this? Even the ones you hardly know are there? Even kyons litter sister?! My my, isn't someone squeezing the franchiese for all it's worth?\nThe only good song you hear is God Knows. That's all I have to say about that.\nArt:\nI'm not sure if everyone knows this or not but the art (for the manga) was done by a hentai artist, and carried over into the anime in his style. This explains why they're all large eyed with tiny waists and hands in short skirts and maid uniforms. He also did the art for Shakugan no Shana but atleast in Shana, there are MALES.\nAnimation, is ok. Not bad I suppose.\nEnjoyment:\nWell, I will put this simply. I liked it now and then, and sometimes I would doze off. Monologs every episode are not ok.\nOverall:\nI can imagine that the original novels are much better but the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya leaves me in melancholy myself. I wouldn't heavily recomend this series, but it's good for perhapes, one watch. I personnally do not find it very amazingly interesting, and there are alot of people who agree, and plenty who dissagree. Either way, Haruhi dosn't quite get my vote.\n        "},

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya began as a light novel written by Tanigawa Nagaru and illustrated by Ito Noizi. The series quickly became insanely popular and had two anime versions. Is the popularity well deserved or not so much. Let's take a look at the first anime to find out. \nThe story begins with a group of students making a really bad movie and then it skips back to the actual beginning. The episodes don't follow a linear order. They skip around quite a bit. Not that it matters much since the story is pretty unimportant. The important parts are that a girl named Haruhi\n          \n        is obsessed with aliens, espers and time travelers. She forms a brigade to study strange and interesting things. The brigade is mostly composed of people with strange secrets that revolve around the mystery that is Haruhi and one normal guy who's there to be ordinary and serve as a stand-in for the audience. Storywise, everything becomes pretty clear after a few episodes. There are some interesting ideas but they're never explored. They barely even go past the surface with any of them. It doesn't really matter though since it's a comedy. Is it funny? Well, some of the humour works well and some of it is horrible. There's a Phoenix Wright parody that's very subtle and works really well, but there are also a lot of jokes where sexual harassment is played up as being funny and those are horrible and problematic. Overall, the humour works a little more than not, but it is mixed. \nThere are some things that work with the characters, but they're mostly defined by their relationships to Haruhi and their strange personality traits, for those who have them. They aren't horribly written but they certainly aren't compelling.\nThe art is well done. The backgrounds are nicely detailed and the characters have unique appearances. My only issue with the art is that they use way too much fan-service.\nThe voice acting is well done. All of the actors employ subtlety well. There actually isn't too much exaggeration in this. One issue is that Chihara Minori and Sugita Tomokazu both sound bored with their performances. There's a character reason with Yuki, but that isn't the case with Kyon. The music is really the strongest element. It's upbeat and high tempo. For the themes, Hirano Aya does a really good job with the vocals.\nThe yuri factor is a 5/10. Unfortunately, it's all a result of the harassment jokes involving Haruhi and Mikuru. \nMy final rating for the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a 6/10. It's decent but it's held back by the lackluster characters and the fact that the humour only works roughly 60% of the time. \n        "},

Although not perfect, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya has an intriguing mix of warmth, beauty, style, and comedy that make this anime worthy of such a high rating.  \n**This section may have spoilers. Please read at your own discretion.**\nStory-9/10\n    The story follows the adventures of the SOS Brigade (Spreading Excitement all Over the World with the Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade,) which consists of Brigade Leader, Haruhi Suzumiya, “Mysterious Transfer Student” Itsuki Koizumi, “Mascot”\n          \n        Mikuru Asahina, Literary-Club-Turned-Brigade-Member Yuki Nagato, and Average Student, Kyon. \n    The intrigue starts when the many characters reveal their true identities to Kyon: Yuki Nagato is an Alien, Mikuru Asahina is a Time Traveler, and Itsuki Koizumi is an Esper, and the reason they are all at North High School is to observe Haruhi Suzumiya, who, although she doesn’t know it, has the ability to destroy the world! \n     The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is, in my opinion, primarily a science fiction series, although it adds enough humor to make it fun. The episodes range from the main character, Kyon, discovering that his classmate, Haruhi is, as alien Yuki Nagato put it, “the key to human evolution,” to the SOS Brigade partaking in a baseball tournament.\n    The original broadcasting order of the series was not chronological, however I recommend viewing them in proper order. I recommend this because it just makes more sense that way. I was hooked enough since episode 1; I didn’t need extra confusion to make me continue watching.  \nArt-10/10\n    As I stated earlier, I don’t watch many anime, but even I can see that the art is beautifully done. The animation is superb: every single episode is graceful, beautiful, and fluid. The animators clearly invested their time into making this masterpiece, and I sincerely thank Kyoto Animation for doing so. \nSound-10/10\n    The opening and ending are sung by Aya Hirano, and are, in my opinion, just lovely. I adore Japanese music, and these songs are one-if not my favorite-of the genre.\n    The voice acting for both the English and Japanese versions are wonderful. I prefer dubs to subs, but either are great in this case. \nCharacter-9/10\n(This section will be the longest since I absolutely loved the characters.)\n    This anime has every stereotypical type of character: the “average guy,” the “pretty boy,” the “silent one,” the “cute one,” and the “headstrong one-“ and yet, each one of them are so unique that it would be an injustice to call them simple stereotypes.\nKyon-\n    Kyon is your everyday high school freshman; moody, sarcastic, and indifferent. He has a cynical approach to nearly every problem he faces.  His development with each individual character is too much to write, but the catalyst to his change was Haruhi. In the first episode, Kyon seems selfish and unmotivated, but that all changes once he joins the SOS Brigade. Although he still seems reluctant, he will do nearly anything that Haruhi says, though he will object to her schemes if need be. He becomes much more open and accepting, although he still has a ways to go. \nItsuki Koizumi-\n    Itsuki is a polite, gentlemanly young man; nearly every girl’s “dream guy,” if you will. He reveals himself to be an Esper who was sent by “The Organization” to keep an eye on Haruhi Suzumiya. Thus he is very compliant and greets all of her demands with a smile, albeit a fake one. Itsuki is perhaps the most mysterious character in the bunch, because his true personality is unknown. \n    He often brings up very philosophical points when conversing with Kyon. Most people find his speeches (on topics such as the Anthropic Principle) to be bromidic, but I think they’re fascinating. If you enjoy science (or cute boys), then you’ll probably like Itsuki Koizumi.\nMikuru Asahina\n    Miss Asahina is sweet, timid, and kind. She was “voluntarily arrested” by Haruhi and, much to her apparent dismay, is the club’s “mascot” due to her attractive figure.  Haruhi often dresses Mikuru into cosplay outfits, such as a bunny, nurse, and maid. Many say her only role is for fanservice, but I disagree.\n   Miss Asahina’s true identity is a Time Traveler: she comes from the future, although how far in the future is unknown (it’s classified.) She was, just as the other supernatural beings, sent to observe Miss Suzumiya. I find her to be quite admirable. With the help of Kyon (who is her protector of sorts,) she puts up with much abuse, and does so, for the most part, with a straight face.  She even attempts to hide her feelings for Kyon, all due to her mission to keep the world safe. \nYuki Nagato\n    Yuki Nagato is introduced as the lone member of the literary club. Introverted and reserved, Miss Nagato rarely speaks, although when she does, it’s usually very important. \n    Miss Nagato reveals herself to be a Humanoid Interface, sent by the Data Integration Thought Entity to observe Haruhi Suzumiya. She is very powerful and is often the sole protector of Kyon and the rest of the SOS Brigade when they are in a dangerous situation. Quite important, she can manipulate data around her (although not to Miss Suzumiya’s extent) and prevents many disastrous events from occurring.\n    Out of all the characters, Miss Nagato is perhaps the one with the most depth. Although originally taciturn and stoic, she begins to experience human emotions after observing them for so long. Hopefully she will continue to learn and grow, and one day will be able to smile along with her fellow friends. \nHaruhi Suzumiya-\n    I saved the most memorable character for last-Miss Haruhi Suzumiya. Eccentric, brave, and beautiful, Miss Suzumiya embodies the human spirit of raw eagerness and determination (which is  ironic, considering that she is, in fact, not human.) \n    Miss Suzumiya seems to be the most relatable character-although strong on the outside, on the inside she is quite vulnerable and yearns for purpose and meaning. The root of this desire began when she had the realization that she was only one of billions of people. In order to make a name for herself, she began to pursue the inhuman.\n    Although she is not aware of it, this wish was granted, and due to her request. She is, in fact, a powerful being who has the ability to create and destroy the world-of course, she doesn’t know this.\n    So, she creates the SOS Brigade, despite half the member’s unwillingness to join.  This is when we see all of Miss Suzumiya’s less desirable traits; despite being beautiful and athletic, she is narcissistic, bossy, and rude. She thinks only of herself and caters only to her own demands. It’s thanks to Kyon that she begins to realize the error of her ways and slowly but surely begins to accept other’s opinions-although it will be a long, long time before one can call her considerate. \nEnjoyment-10/10\n    This story is the perfect mix of excitement, humor, and intrigue. I would watch this again and again. \nOverall-9/10\n    The majority of the story is well-thought-out and interesting, the animation and vocals are wonderful, and the characters themselves are fantastic. If you have not yet seen the series I would without a doubt recommend it. I look forward to future seasons and hope that the show’s message of friendship and acceptance will resonate in the heart of every viewer."},

I like it , but i don't know why.This anime is full of mystery, The main Heroine known as a God, and besides her , there was time traveler , alien , esper and normal human. well when i was watching it ,i was getting confused but , later, it's fell like i'm enjoying it.\nFrom The Story\ni'm not gonna say that the story is messed up. The story is full of mysterious. Why the main Heroine was a god? Why time traveler, esper, alien was besides her?, and many other mysterious question that is hard to answer or maybe impossible\n          \n        to answer. Well , let's set that aside , after wathing 4 or 5 episode,i don't why, i'm enjoying the episode. Maybe because there's some comedy in the show.\n9/10\nFrom the Art:\nThe art is good. The character design is good too, well i don't know what to say anymore cause the art is just good in my eyes. nothing wrong with it, well , it's like normal.\n7/10 \nFrom the sound:\nThe sound is nice especially i like the opening song. Well , i don't know if someone feel the same way i feel too , i feel that the opening song like 90's song from west. I think that's just my own opinion. From the soundtrack in the show, it was really fit perfect to the art and the story , so i guess it's good to me.\n7/10\nFrom the Character:\nThe personality that every character had is very awesome, especially Haruhi and Nagato. Mikuru is good and funny too but those two is very awesome. Haruhi alwasy do something crazy , and Nagato almost never talk and never have a single emotion on her face. Koizumi was kinda creeping my out tough. Kyon is funny too, He is like haruhi guardian or something like haruhi baby sit, always besides haruhi and he always hated her but he can't take take off his eyes from her.\n9/10 \nFrom the Enjoyment:\nWell, I really was enjoy the show because of the crazyness and the fun thing.

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    This review contains very mild spoilers and a bit more detailed spoilers from episode 2, any of those spoilers are plot-related\nI started watching Suzumiya Haruhi with pretty high hopes because it is a really beloved series by a lot of fans but I have to admit that the hype killed off a bit of my final experience. Starting with something good episode 1 is fantastic and it sets a lot of the good things about this anime right off the bat:\n- The character designs and general artstyle are great, that's something that caught me off guard because its a relatively old anime but looks like\n          \n        KyoAni did a really good job on that.\n- The protagonist, Kyon, is your typical high-school-slice-of-life anime protagonist type-B, the teenager with a kind of realistic mindset that is oftenly lost in his own thoughts, the good thing is that he's generally not as painfully dense as other type-B protagonists (couhcoughTOUMAcough) and he has an interesting relationship with Haruhi.\n- Haruhi also looks like a rather interesting character, she's a genki girl that, as we see along the episode it looks like she has some things going on with her, also personal plus: I love her voice acting.\n- The episode had a fluid direction that doesn't feel stale at any moment.\n- Good OP, really iconic ED.\nThe next paragraph contains some mild spoilers of episode 2\nI'm not going to review every single episode but episode 2 is an exception because in my personal opinion is by far the worst episode in the entire anime, luckily is not because of some plot essential points going off the window but because there are a lot of things on this episode that really pissed me off and almost made me drop the anime, in fact plot-wise the entire episode can be summarised in one sentence: Haruhi makes a school club and Kyon joins in with some other 3 secondary characters, with that information in mind you can skip the entire episode, you won't see the presentation of the 3 side characters but it doesn't matter as its really easy to guess their personalities and their presentation doesn't add up nothing important.\nThe first flaw is that we discover that Haruhi is the kind of character that walks through the thin and blurry line of being an energetic bossy and cheerful genki girl and being a sassy bratty and a bit selfish genki girl who thinks that the entire world revolves around her, on episode 2 we see the most extreme moments of that second part from her personality many times and I have to say that she's not nearly as annoying on the rest of the anime as she is on this episode but if you don't have a lot of patience with this kind of characters I really really recommend you to read the previous paragraph and skip episode 2.\nOn the next episodes some plot revelations happen and we see that this will not be a conventional slice of life anime but that it will have certain things going on the background, anyways the anime still follows a conventional format with all your slice of life tropes featuring a beach episode, fair and fireworks episode, sports event episode etc etc but with the previously mentioned background plot going on that shows every once in a while, the next arc after the plot revelations (more or less ep 4 to ep 7) is what I consider the best arc of the entire anime but then it falls off with some empty slice of life episodes that leave the interesting background plot to one side and becomes just a normal slice of life anime for a while, to be honest they are not bad episodes but they are filler episodes that waste a lot of the potential of the anime, after some filler we get to the final arc where another revelation happens and we end the anime with an actually pretty interesting open-ended ending (where the 2nd season will start) \nOverall I think Suzumiya Haruhi is a good anime with its strengths and weaknesses but it definetly isn't the shiny gem that I've heard from a lot of people in the past, it has a really interesting premise but it doesn't play that much with its potential, Haruhi as a character I can see why she has so many fans but I didn't like her because I can't stand \"naughty and energetic but sometimes with a good heart\" type of characters and even less Haruhi because we don't see a lot that second trait coming from her and too much of the first, her relationship with Kyon is the second best thing about the anime along with the background plot but Kyon as a character is plain and underdeveloped even though as I said at the beginning he's somewhat better than other anime protagonists that follow his archetype.\nThe other 3 side characters are really plain and uninteresting being each one of them a walking archetype with no development whatsoever, each one of them are deeply related with the background plot but only one gets some extra personality development from it, everything else about their personality goes around 3 very simple archetypes \"the timid big boobed girl\", \"the kuudere loli\" and \"the nice guy\": big boobed girl is basically a fanservice dump that sometimes can get annoying with how submissive she is, kuudere loli has that \"emotionless doll\" personality trait that sometimes can get a bit corny (I normally don't find this kind of characters cheesy by itself but this one specifically has some scenes that have a pretentious feeling to them that can get cheesy) and nice guy... well... being a nice guy is literally everything about his personality, he's just kind of there being Kyon's exposition dump and being a nice guy. Also the background plot even if as I said a few times is really good is explained through tons of exposition.\nI have to say that the last paragraph sounds more negative than it really is and what I mean with that is that even with those flaws I still recommend to watch Suzumiya Haruhi, the first half of the anime is really enjoyable and the second half is not bad at all even if it doesn't maintain the quality from previous episodes and the unmentioned background plot is as I said the best part of the entire anime. Also it has a 2nd season and a film so all of its major flaws can very easily be solved with that because any of them are \"this is bad\" but rather \"this isn't enough\" (underdeveloped characters and wasted potential) so I recommend giving it a shot so you can see if you'll like the strengths of this series.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    The rise of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya in the anime industry was insane to say the least. This show was everywhere. People in cosplay were everywhere. Even later DVD sales were crazy. But, why? Studio Kyoto Animation before this show was still small with only having really two shows to show for it, Air and Full Metal Panic Second Raid. Even director Tatsuya Ishihara previously worked on Air, but nothing outstanding. So how did The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya become so popular based on all of this?\nOur main male character is ‘Kyon’, a typical high school student. One day he meets the odd Haruhi\n          \n        Suzumiya whom is a strange one interested in strange things. She wants to find aliens, encounter the supernatural and the like, but the clubs around school do not have these things. Kyon gets her to start her own club after a slow relationship build and thus creates the SOS Brigade (seek out things to make life less boring) along with a cast of odd club members to follow the crazy and other-worldly events with Haruhi Suzumiya.\nThis particular show was shown in a “broadcast” order as opposed to events taking place in chronological order. It was to create a sense of mystery much like the show itself. Haruhi Suzumiya and the anime is simply about a girl and the supernatural creating a world where imagination knows no bound and even the slightest thought could impact reality as we know it. The show establishes that Haruhi is an unknowing god and creator of the entire universe and reality changes based on her “wishes.” Then, all of the characters surrounding her within the SOS Brigade tick all of the anime character arch-types along with making them things like a time-traveler, esper, or robot. Kyon at least is a sarcastic snarky dude and Haruhi is a fun random.\nYes, this show is filled with tropes and anime clichés, but presents them in a fun and refreshing way. At the time, the character art and quality was new and unique plus generally masterfully animated such as a full on drum scene with Haruhi. A small mention is the ending dance sequence choreographed with the show’s cast that went “viral” and Kyoto Animation has seemingly used this in just about every show since. Voice acting in both Japanese and English is an example of hitting the marks right and presents the show well. However, what is not acceptable are some episodes are some of the most boring anime 20 minutes of all time. The prime example of this is the show’s last episode and what is known as the “endless eight.” Either nothing happens or a repeat of a previous episode with the slightest of changes. It is in this where the show plummets in enjoyment.\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a show of fun and enjoyment, but with some gut-wrenchingly terrible episodes and some tropes that are shoved down the viewer’s throat, this anime becomes something of average quality in the end.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    This is my first attempt at a review and as such i apologize for any terrible mistakes or grave offenses to an established form. Also, english is not my native language so you are really in for a ride. The honor to this pilot project goes to the first season of \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.\", a series i really enjoyed. Though it's not my all-time favourite, i actually picked at random. I will stick to the categories that the form provides, because that should be simple and i'll try to avoid spoilers? I will include some of them at the end. Maybe i won't,\n          \n        it's late, okay?\nStory: So lets take about the story, the meat of a series. I gave it a 10, simply because i enjoy story-telling, that is kept ominous. And the story of this show is basically the embodiment of \"show, not tell.\" There are so many things that are hidden in the background and only reveal themselves if you rewatch the show. It can be confusing, with all these different watch orders and the jumping around if you follow the broadcast-order. The creators never really tell you whats happening behind the scenes, since we only get to know what our main character knows. I like it, hell i love it, but thats something that could be really offputting for some. It also throws around the genres like its nobodys business, one second you find yourself in a slice of life-series the next time you could watch a shounen-anime or a detective-story.  \nArt: This gets a 9, everything looks gorgeous. The few fight scenes are well done, the character-design is simple, since they all wear the schooluniform most of the time, but its interesting enough. The art is of a high quality and the animation brings the comedy over to the viewer, i don't really know what else to say \nSound: That's an 8 for me. Anything done by Aya Hirano in this show i absolutely love, be it the opening and the legendary ending or the lovely culture festival(which might actually be my favourite episode of the first season). The background-music does its job, sometimes it stands out(i think about the theme for the very first scene for example.) It's good music, the rest of the sounds are nice as well. Does this include voice acting? Cause thats also great.\nCharacters: That's my favourite section, i think i am really into anime for the interesting characters. So for this show, it's a 10 out of 10, i love the characters, since the plot is so mysterious, they have to be great to carry the series. So lets talk briefly about the five main characters.\nHaruhi Suzumiya might be the title character, but she is not actually our protagonist. A bossy, egoistical maniac, some people worship her as a goddess, others hate her guts. I personally like her, especially since she is relatable in a way, her motivation is to me at least.\nKyon: Best character of the show, hands down.He never gets an actual name, only his nickname is know and yet he is the most relatable of them all. Which ain't hard, considering the nature of his brigade-members.His inner monologues made a big part of the series and without them, we would loose a lot of the comedy. He even gets development! Which main character actually gets development? I am just kidding.\nItsuki Koizumi: He is a funny guy at times, creepy at other times, but i always enjoy when he is on screen. Also the most mysterious i'd say, sometimes you could even question his good intentions. Always smiling, how disturbing.\nMikuru Asahina: The cutie, the mascot of the group fell a little flat for me (how ironic). There is more to her than meets the eye and i get that she is a deliberate cliche, but still, i like her the least of the brigade, which is still a lot.\nYuki Nagato: So.much.hidden.depth! Does she actually have any emotions? You never really know. And just how powerful is Nagato? Basically, the whole planet seems to be like an ant-farm for her and her boss. Well, if one of the ants suddenly developed mind-altering abilities.\nHonorable mentions go to Asakura and Tsuruya, they are fun.\nEnjoyment: Well that's a complicating section. I did enjoy myself at all times during the first season. It's genuinely funny, suspenseful and heartwarming and i can't think of a single episode that bored me.\nOverall (here be spoilers!): It's a 9, almost perfect in my eyes. I can't even say what's missing, without contadicting myself, cause in the end, i'd like to have some more plot. I want to learn more about Koizumis organisation, about the specifics of Asahina's future and how Haruhi actually acquired her god-like power. At least, after multiple rewatches i do,  i was very content with everything when i first watched it. So, to sum it up, i think it's a classic, despite not being that old. It has no precedent and many shows tried to copy elements of it, but at the same it's confusing and there will always be something missing. If you don't adore the characters, you probably won't enjoy the series. It is an adventure, right?! Yes, it is, one that deserves a watch in any case. \n\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Warning: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. I'M NOT EVEN KIDDING. THIS ANIME IS THE HARDEST ANIME TO REVIEW EVER WITHOUT GIVING OFF ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF SPOILERS. READ WITH EXTREME CAUTION. THERE'S A POINT IN THE REVIEW THAT SAYS SPOILER END AND FROM THAT POINT ON YOU CAN READ WITHOUT WORRYING BUT UNTIL YOU SEE THAT BEWARE.\nIntro: Holy cow crap, I don't even know where to start with this anime. It's so good and yet so lame at the same time. It's so overrated yet so unnoticed at the same time. It's so Christian and yet so blasphemous at the same time. It's so macho and yet\n          \n        so feminine at the same time. It's so short and yet so long at the same time. It's so simple and yet so confusing at the same time. It just flat out puts a spell on you and gives you emotions you've never experienced before. Compund feelings, one would say. Holy frickin' cow crap, where the hell do I begin? I'll start out with how popular this anime is. It has a holiday named for it. Nuff said. Now on to the anime itself. This is an amazing anime. \nStory: This isn't it a story summary. Well it is, but it reveals more than just the basic synopsis of the first couple of episodes, so don't delete this review. Moving on... This starts out looking like a Slice of Life anime. High school boy meets messed up high school girl and they start a club where a shy girl with big boobs, a smart, librarian woman who almost never talks and a gay guy who smiles even in the worst situations and they get into crazy situations. Yeah. Sounds wonderful, doesn't it? But wait! Don't give up so soon. This anime combines every genre one can think of, so that means Sci-Fi and Fantasy also. Apparently the librarian girl is actually an alien, the gay guy is an esper, the shy girl with big boobs is a time travler, and Haruhi herself is God and she doesn't even know it. Take a look at the last part. A girl has the power to make any of her wishes and dreams come true to reality. And she doesn't. Even. Frigging. Know it. I'm sorry, but that's just genius. Who the hell came up with that? It's brilliant! Though I don't think this is the best anime of all time, it definitely has the best plot of all time. So why isn't it #1? Well, because that plot isn't executed as good as some others on this list. For one thing, the time it takes for the truth of all this sci-fi crap to be explained is unnecessary. There's one episode where it takes the gay guy about 10-15 minutes to explain that Haruhi is God and he is an esper. Couldn't he just tell Kyon that she is God instead of wasting my time? And most of the information he gives is too detailed and never used in the show itself. Now this anime is starting to sound really retarted again, doesn't it? DON'T GIVE UP YET! Once everything is explained about Haruhi and the others, things get fun. But before I get into that, I'll explain the fifth (aka 14th) episode. This is the episode that won me over to this show permanently. It is one of the best single 22-minute episodes of Japanese animation I have ever seen. Through the first half of the episode Haruhi seems to be in a bad mood, clearly seen by the way she treats the rest of the club. But because she's friggin' Haruhi, when she gets in a bad mood, she begins to think that the world she lives in is boring. So why not change it and make it the weird, psycho alien world she wants it to be? She does just that. Kind of. She does it in Kyon and her own dream. She and Kyon are the only two people in the world (which I find interesting how she would set it up that way) and they're at the school which is deserted and there's a barrier blocking them from leaving the campus. At first Haruhi doesn't like ther world that she herself created, but then some monsters show up. Even though they're tearing up the school and trying to destroy everything they see in front of them, Haruhi is amazed by the sight of them and wants to be friends with them. Kyon smartly tries to make her run from the monsters but finally she decides that she likes the world she's currently in and stops. The monster approaches and Kyon tries to tell Haruhi her powers, but without telling her too much. Kyon has to find a way to get the world back to normal, and somehow he finds it. He comments on her ponytail being sexy and they kiss. Then they both wake up, but Haruhi waking up ocurrs off-screen. The next day, Kyon sees Haruhi with a ponytail again. GENIUS BEYOND ALL RECOGNITION!!!! And then from that point on the show involves crazy fun between the club and Haruhi such as an episode where a baseball game has to be won or else the world will die or an episode where Haruhi conjurs up violence to bring excitement to a boring vacation. All this and she still never finds out about her powers. Ever. Then there's a very, very, VERY famous episode where the SOS Brigade (Haruhi's club) films a movie. Just imagine the characters of this show making their own movie. IT'S FLIPPING HILARIOUS. Then there's another very very very famous episode where Haruhi performs in concert as a substitute for a band who got sick or something. The performance is a huge success where many people cheer. I love it because it gives an effect on Haruhi that she could be special. And then there's the final episode of the show (chronologically). Most people either love or hate this episode. The reason why people love it is the same reason why other people hate it. That reason is nothing special happens. Haruhi just asks Kyon to get an air conditioner or something like that and he does just that. The episode itself is somewhat boring and slow, but the ending takes the cake. I'm not even going to tell you what it is. I'm just going to say that this is one of the best anime shows of all time, and whether it looks good to you or not, watch it. Don't start watching it thinking it's going to be the best anime of all time, but don't start watching it thinking it's going to be the worst anime of all time either. Start watching it treating it likes it going to be like any other anime you've seen before and draw your own conclusions to it. Me? I fracking love it.\nSPOILER END SPOILER END SPOILER END SPOILER END SPOILER END\nArt: Just because I made an epic conclusion doesn't mean the review is over yet. Now on to the animation. Though it's not amazing and mind-blowing, it's still very good and often impressive. Some of the characters looks shorter than they're actual age would assume, but it's much better than Lucky Star as far as that goes. Often you'll see great detail in the scenes that need it most and when you do see that detail it's very beautiful.\nSound: Now this part is hard to review. Now most of the song's in this show would be considered gay if you played it at your school. Show Hare Hare Yukai or Bouken Desho Desho to your anime-hating friends on your iTunes and they're going to believe you're queer. (unless you're a girl, then they're just going to believe you're strange) But I would rather become a transvestite than stop listening to these tunes. They're very catchy, fun, and it's hard not to dance to them. Then we've got some other songs like God Knows and Lost my Music, which are awesome and if you're friends think you're gay just because you listen to THEM, they're just being retarted. Then there's some character songs. My favorite of them, the most famous of them, is the one for Yuki (the smart librarian). It's called Yuki, Muon, madobe nite. and it gets in my head for months, especially the Program Hack Remix. Then there's the symphony music that plays at the 'last' episode, and I don't think that scene would be half as epic without it. As far the voices go, this is one of the few animes where the English dub is actually really good, and the original Japanese dub is of course even better. The voices fit the characters they go with perfectly, which helps a lot in the overall department.\nCharacter: This is probably the weakest part of this anime, and you know you've got a good anime if the weakest part has an 8 rating. The only problem I had with the characters is that their basic personalities were somewhat unoriginal. We've got a crazy girl as the main character and a cool but not to the point of where he's bada** guy as her boyfriend. (Let's face it, they're bf and gf, or they should be anyway) Then we've got a really shy girl with a nice body who gets raped all the time. (Yeah like that hasn't been done before) We also have a happy, almost TOO happy guy who always smiles even in the worst situations. He's very questionable and has a strange relationship with Kyon, the cool guy. (also unoriginal) Here's where some people might get mad at me. I think that Yuki has an unoriginal personality. She rarely speaks, is quite smart and can kick your butt to the bitter end. That's been done before. A lot. With both male and female characters in any type of anime. Now that doesn't mean that she's not cool. Even though I've seen this type of personality in many animes before, she still is insanely cool and I've got the hots for her and I've not afraid to admit it. So the reason why the characters got an 8 was because even though most of them have been done before, they're executed in ways that haven't, and are just plain fun to watch.\nEnjoyment: The enjoyment of this anime is like a roller coaster ride. That's the best way to describe it. It goes up and up and up slowly but surely and then it soars down fast and hard and makes tons of loop the loops and curls from that point on, then it finally slows down again, but this time it eventually stops. And that's when the show (or this season anyway) ends.\nOverall: For this I'll just repost what I said earlier. I'm just going to say that this is one of the best anime shows of all time, and whether it looks good to you or not, watch it. Don't start watching it thinking it's going to be the best anime of all time, but don't start watching it thinking it's going to be the worst anime of all time either. Start watching it treating it likes it going to be like any other anime you've seen before and draw your own conclusions to it. Me? I fracking love it, and whether you end up loving it or hating it you SHOULD watch it either way.\n"},

I was introduced to the series by it's God-like popularity dance and Lucky Star. By the time I was halfway done with Lucky Star, curiosity got the best of me and I went to look it up, I found how the story went. (Will save for Story section later) At first glance, the series just looked like a slice of life comedy anime. I do enjoy those a lot, so I was willing to give it a shot. But the turn of events was startling at best.\nLet's begin.\nStory:\nLike I said before,\n          \n        The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya just looked like to be your average High School life show. When I watched the first episode, I was confused. Who's this girl wearing the bunny costume? Who's the guy just walking by? Who's the witch? Who's the narrator? Who's that other girl? One would think that they would at least introduce all these characters properly instead of just throwing them at you. Thankfully, as I watched the next episode. The characters are given a real introduction and the setting is set. A High school club going on merry adventures. Sounds fine so far. Next episodes. Well... that's were things got freaky. Apparently, things are not as normal as they appear to be. Yuki Nagato, the silent bookworm, is an artificial human? Mikuru Asahina, the moeblolb, is a time traveler? Itsuki Koizumi, the handsome character, is an esper? And most of all, Haruhi Suzumiya, eccentric freak, is... God? Where does that come from? Why?! Still confused, I continued on to the rest of the episodes, and then I just got used to the identities of the characters. Merry adventures with some paranormal activity thrown in. So, overall, while the plot seems a little out of hand, one just gets used to it and continues watching anyway. Besides, everything just seems much more interesting, anyway.\nArt/Sound:\nI have nothing much to say about the art and sound other than it's absolutely fabulous. The art seems to fit well with the series and doesn't distract from the episodes. The sound is superb with tracks such as \"God Knows...\",\"Bouken Desho Desho?\", and my personal favorite, \"Hare Hare Yukai\". I'd also like to throw a bone at the animation studio for doing such a marvelous job with the series. Vibrant colors and fluent animation! Big part of the delicious cake that is the Haruhi Suzumiya series.\nCharacters:\nIn this section I will only talk about the SOS Brigade. Starting with the snarky character, Kyon.\nKyon to me is the quintessence of the normal high school student. Over his childhood dream of the paranormal, moving on with his life only with a small circle friends to keep him company. As a narrator, he can get quite tiring to hear, since all he does is complain about Haruhi and praise Mikuru. However, he does serve to be a memorable character, as he seems to be the voice of reason, opposing to Haruhi's bizarre antics. Without him, the series would be much less interesting. It is entertaining to see his and Haruhi's views clash. When needed, he does serve by either persuading Haruhi to use her God-like powers (which happens most of the time) or helping any way he can, like the sidekick he always dreamed to be as a child.\nHaruhi Suzumiya is a very strange character. Not much can describe her other than \"Genki Girl\". She is just like loose cannon, ready to fire whenever. For some, it may be strange for the series to be called \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\" when said character is happy. Most of the time. The series title does have a meaning. Later on in the series, she reveals why she is the way she is. This means that all Haruhi wants is an interesting life. That is why she goes searching for the paranormal. It's just too bad the she is completly clueless that they are right under her nose. Unlike the other characters, her plot device doesn't overshadow her traits. Overall, Haruhi is like a child in need. But we love her anyway.\nMikuru Asahina is probably the weakest character in the series. Whenever she gets harrased by Haruhi, she always let's herself be fondled. The poor girl doesn't do much except be cute. Later on, in the light novels, she does serve a purpose. However, since this review is about the anime, I can't say much about Mikuru Asahina. She just seems to have a lot of unused potential.\nYuki Nagato is my favorite character of the bunch. In the brigade clubroom, she appears to be on the same level as furniture. Outside it, however, she is an artificial human observing over Haruhi Suzumiya. Even if it doesn't sound like much, Yuki proves herself to be a very likeable character. She's there whenever anybody needs her (Mostly Kyon) and is just so... kickass. She shows this mostly in episode 5, but that is for you, the reader, to watch! Overall, Yuki Nagato seems silent, but she is just misunderstood.\nWhile Kyon may be the voice of reason, Itsuki Koizumi is the information giver. Without him, I would still be completely dumbfounded on the plot. He comes in as a mysterious transfer student and sure enough, he does have a few secrets hidden under his smile. He is the caretaker of Haruhi's emotions. While he isn't exactly calming her down in person, he destroys creatures called Celestails in an area called Closed Space (or Sealed Dimension). However, inside the clubroom, he serves as Haruhi's Yes man just so she won't be upset. While this does seem very bland and annoying, Itsuki serves himself a valuable character in the series.\nEnjoyment:\nThis series gave me much enjoyment while watching!\nOverall:\nWatch this series. I don't care if you don't like moeblobs, plot twists, or cliches. This anime is a beautiful gem in the anime world. No wonder it is cherished by many.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is one of the most famous and iconic Anime out there, creating probably one of the biggest fan bases, and can be found to be the founder of many internet meme's (Hare Hare Yukai, gender bender characters, endless etc) and is often either parodied or referenced in a lot of other shows.\nThe story follows a guy nicknamed Kyon who ends up becoming the lackey for Haruhi along with the eventual creation of the SOS Brigade, once the club is formed they participate in many activities including a baseball game and a murder mystery to anme a few, there is also\n          \n        some supernatural element thrown in there which really adds to the story and its characters.\nI would say the art for this show is adequate, it is by no means the best, the backgrounds are occasionally very simple paintings with not a lot of detail and the perspective of some shot is not always perfect, they also use some different art choices, there is one scene where they use real live actors with a Photoshop style effect on it, we are also treated to a grainy effect as well as some CG which all add to the show and always fit nicely into there respective scenes, the characters are genrally well drawn. The animation is really great, we have a fully animated concert scene without any still frames at all, and we are treated to some interesting camera angles and perspectives which really help this show stand out from others.\nThe sound is brilliant, the voice acting for the English dub is decent, Crispin Freeman as Kyon did an exceptional job whereas the rest of the cast, although fit there respective roles well, generally didn't stand out as amazing. The music is quite iconic, the opening tune is a nice song and includes some meaningfull visuals, the ending, Hare Hare Yokai, is quite probably one of the most popular ending songs, its got a catchy tune and the character dance makes you want to learn it yourself. Background music is mostly a nice calm soft score but it does vary it up by adding a good variety, like the 'dream sequence' there is a real nice epic classical song.\nCharacters, well where do you start, well for one it is highly unlickly you will find yourself disliking any character. Kyon is the protagonist who offers us a quick wit and some excellent lines in his narration, you sometime find it difficult to tell whether he is narrating or not, Kyon desribes himself as the SOS Brigades conscience, and he is quite right. Haruhi is an energergetic unprodictable girl as quite the infamous reputation in her school. Yuki Nagato is the robot silent girl of the group who doesn't show any emotion what so ever and can take things all to literal. Mikuru is clumsy and innocent and is often the victim of one of Haruhi's escapades being forced to dress up in various costumes, then finally we have Koizumi who tends to tease Kyon about his situation and offers more of his views of the current situation. The rest of the side characters are great when they make there appearance with Taniguchi and Kunakida being those two guys who pop up every now and again, Tsuruya, Mikurus friends is an insane person and Kyon's sister whose name is never revealed is simply adorable.\nOverall this show is up there with the best comedies Anime has to offer, it is clever in its dialogue, it shows us camera perspectives and angles we would never have been shown, the characters are loverable, the show is one of those you can rewatch many times over and never get bored and THIS season definitely live up to most of the expectations you get when you learn of its fan base. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is one of those show every Anime fan needs to see at least once."},

My stance still stands though that Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is awful.\nWell, hi. So this is my first anime review ever on MAL, so bare with me here Haha, I bet you've heard this a thousand times if you've been on MAL awhile, huh? Especially since I am new here on MAL. Anyways, I'm definitely going to have more reviews in the future. Okay so where to start? I guess we can start off by saying NO, I didn't like TMoHS and I don't (in my opinion) think it deserves nines or\n          \n        tens, and here is why.\nNOTE: IT HAS BEEN AWHILE SINCE I HAVE SEEN THIS ANIME SO PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG ON SOME THINGS! Also sorry if I jump around a lot. I should also mention I'm going to try to make this short and simple Although might end up lengthy. Okay let's just dive right in!\nSTORY: 3\nI won't brother having a long ass intro to what this anime is about like most people, clearly you can read the synopsis MAL has provided for you. Moving on.\nWithout saying, as I'm sure you know the episodes are not in order. Who on earth came up with that idea? I can tell you right now that turned me off the anime big time when I learned this. No, it isn't the worse that could have happened but it definitely isn't a plus in my book. I think remember this actually have some meaning though, I can't recall, anyways. As far as the story itself goes it is pretty interesting, and that's what drew me to this as well as the hype, but it fails miserably to execute, and overall kids joining and making clubs is nothing new at all not is a character having some sort of powers.\nI just usually give the anime I'm watching a good chance, as one should. With, TMoHS I tired the best I could to give it a chance without exploding with confusion, from the fact this series is so popular and a headache of being disappointed. I think that's all that happened for me while watching TMoHS, DISPOINTMENT, and a lot of it! I literally struggled to get though each and every episode. \nWith all the high praise and scores for this anime I thought, \"I really need to watch it, I've heard about it and know of it, and have seen GIFS floating around, defiantly need to get to watching it\". Whelp, I did. All I can say is I am baffled why this series is so popular and I'm, again, disappointed, I expected a lot more. It's just random in my opinion, and very strung together. There's not much more to say. The story premise is mediocre at best and could have been more, but wasn't.\nCHARACTERS: 2\nThe main characters I want to address are Suzumiya and Kyon, so let's do that.\nFirst off we have Suzumiya Haruhi. She's, as another person, greatly described her, aggressive. That's all she is, aggressive. She also is so touchy-feely. She touches everyone and everything as far as I can remember. Suzumiya is really obnoxious and really is just this character who is oblivious to consequences and repercussions and is bossy and very control driven. I think people try to make excuses for her behavior to some of the other characters, calling her eccentric. No, I don't think a lot of what she does is okay. Moving on.\nThen there is Kyon, the main protagonist. He's just your typical average school boy for an anime and pretty generic and quite cliche to the core, IMO. Although out of all the characters he was my favourite and the most appealing. To be honest he wouldn't have even been a bad character necessarily if he had more character development. The one shining thing about his character though was that his presence fit well with all the other characters.\nThe other characters played their part, but overall they were mediocre. I won't spend time babbling about them because you can read character bios.\n\nART: 7\nWhelp, I'd be lying if I said TMoHS had bad art. It doesn't fail in that respect at all. It defiantly drew me to this anime. Although it in it's self isn't out there crazy, never been done before style. I mean don't get me wrong, it is quite lovely in my opinion, some of the better art I've seen, but I've also seen better. I actually really enjoyed the toning and colours used though, they're beautiful, and work well together, and they stand out, but at it's core the art is highly mediocre. \nSOUND: 4\nThe opening (from eps 2-9, 11-13) is okay, it's catchy. I have heard anime openings though and literally gasped at them. Zetsuen no Tempest for example has a kick-ass opening, if I do say so myself. I have no opinion on the ending (from eps 1-13). The sound effects, etc, throughout the series was average.\nSIDE NOTE: (JUST AN OPINION) \nI felt like the series tired to tried to pull \"deep\" quotes out of random to be honest. At some point in the anime, Itsuki was saying something, I believe to  Suzumiya, and I can remember what episode it was so the many of you have already seen this anime might know what episode I'm talking about. Anyways it seems like there was some forced \"deep\" quoting there. Not many will agree or maybe even caught on to this, but this is just my opinion.\nOVERALL: 4\nI think personally TMoHS is highly overrated and poorly constructed. It was anime that could have been so much more but wasn't, and that's the sad part. I think I more or less just didn't feel this anime lived up the the hype it was given. I won't say don't watch this, watch it for yourself and make your own opinions on it, but this a anime for me was hard to get through and didn't stick at all. We all have animes, even really popular ones we don't like, it is just that simple. \nThis being my first review it was probably bad, I'm sorry for that. Anyways, Fair winds everyone. \n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    This anime centers around Haruhi Suzumiya, literally. The anime revolves around how her \"friends\" must endure their life at highschool making sure Haruhi is NEVER bored, sad, confused etc. or the world will end because she is God. \nThe anime had great potential, but for some unknown reason has many great reviews 5/5 stars etc etc. But I honestly cannot fathom, how this anime could rate so highly. \nThe story-line, though unique and interesting, even though confusing at first; you can understand it as you progress through the anime. As well as having an interesting concept, this anime would score highly for that, BUT THAT\n          \n        ALONE. \nThe character, Haruhi Suzumiya, is presented to be loved and admired by many many people in her highschool; however after enduring the entire 2 seasons and movie, I honestly cannot see the appeal that a lot people have for this anime and its heroine. \nKyon (the protagonist) is a solid main character, however, his influence in the anime is pretty much reduced to nothing, due to Haruhi's character dominating the anime, this means the anime solely revolves around Haruhi alone which is it's first downfall.\nI honestly can say that i have never seen a heroine that has ticked me off as much as Haruhi. She is a selfish, self-centered and egocentric girl, who is also simply a terrible person (Honestly, who really cares if she is 'cute'. Every bloody heroine in any anime can be cute and act cute. The CHARACTER is whats important!) She does not realise how selfish she is, nor does she grow any more humane, she does not have an epiphany or any realization even at the end of the anime, which i thought was the biggest let down, as the anime takes you on a journey exploring her character. \nIf you honestly like this anime, you some how overlooked Haruhi then, because i cannot, in anyway possible show any love for a character which seems to be more like the villain.\nSimply a bad execution, to a good concept for an anime. All thanks to the terrible use of 1 character; visuals are great, music is good too, but the characters use is a bit lackluster, Kyon and the other sub characters are rather interesting to watch, however I do not believe this anime deserves the praise it has gotten.\nIf you disagree, i honestly think you should just watch more anime (A LOT MORE), and then watch this again, to understand where i'm coming from. You'd probably have just as much difficulty liking the anime to its fullest. (The movie however does change it up a bit, where Kyon gets his much needed time to shine as a main character, therefore making the movie a lot better than the anime in a lot of aspects.)\nAll in all. CHARACTERS ARE IMPORTANT. and how they are portrayed, should at least make more sense. (Having a highschool girl being a god that created the world 3 years ago, who is selfish, self-centered and not very likable is unique, but for the wrong reasons.) I really wanted to like this anime, as there is a lot of praise for it and I was expecting more, however not to say this is a bad anime, it is disappointing none the less.\nAlso, this is meant to be a mix of sci-fi and slice of life genre's, i'll be blunt: This anime cannot hold up on its own in either genre's.\nIf you want a sci-fi anime watch: Cowboy Bebop or Ano Natsu de Matteru\nIf you want a slice of life anime watch: Natsume Yujin-cho, Kimi to Boku or Sakamichi no Apollon (Kids on the slope) \nAfter watching these great anime, I wont lie and say this anime is great or even good, it is only average. Sub-par. Trust me, you can't review an anime and say \"Everything is awesome, just ignore the \"Endless Eight\" and it's definately 5/5!!\" THATS THE SAME AS SAYING \"This movie is awesome, as long as you ignore 40 minutes of the movie!!!\" you just can't do that."},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    ((The same as second Season without endless 8))\nThis is one of those strange little shows that to me; is a gem. If you start watching it, it might be rather strange because of the order that is given to you. The first episode 00 is not really the first. It’s the episode that the group makes later on in the show. A lot of shows are like that, in the wrong order. When it aired is a nonlinear way known as Kyon order. It almost makes no sense and so I suggest that you watch them in the Haruhi order which if you are looking\n          \n        at Kyon order number, it would be 2, 3, 5, 10, 13, 14, 4, 7, 6, 8, 1, 12, 11 and 9. What does piss me off though is that in 2009, they added a new season, but it is supposed to be mixed in with Season 1 that added additional footage and dialogue to the story. It means that I have to rewatch the whole show again with the second season and try to put them together.\nThe feel of the show is like a Nuevo, and it’s nice to have Kyon’s thoughts on the whole idea of Haruhi’s antics. I don’t think I would be able to stand this show without his calculated thoughts and it would go into Azumanga Daioh mode I think. I really do wish I could hear more about his background and about his little sister. Every once in a while, she just seems to pop up out of nowhere and doesn’t seem to be part of anything. She could just as easily been left out instead of having her in the show. There were also times when they lost me, talking a lot about logic and philosophies in the characters who are around Kyon. I can understand when It’s Yuki, maybe even Itsuki but when Mikuru starts talking logically about time travel and then suddenly goes into ‘That’s classified’ thing, it just gets annoying because it doesn’t seem like her character.\nThe animation is pretty good, though it’s pretty much the same as almost any other school life with the rather clean artwork though they have constant hair-los even in the dark. It’s this nice little shine that went all the way around there heads. It’s a bit annoying in that aspect. The background is pretty washed out and the people stand out really nicely against it being bright. There is a lot of fan service, especially with Mikuru and the strange outfits that Haruhi forces her into. I have to say, I would have thought Haruhi would look a bit more out of control looking then what she looks like. \nThe voices in the English actually are much better in my mind but that is just my opinion. I can understand them much better if I don’t have to read the sub titles and not only that, Wendee Lee is a great Haruhi! I love her out of control voice and right next to Crispin Freeman’s cool and collected voice, it sounds really well done. Much like yin and yang. I’m not really sold on Stephanie Sheh’s Mikuru. She seems a little too timid and high pitched. It’s also nice to hear that Johnny Yong Bosch as Itsuki with a cool and collected character instead of the hot headed thugs he seems to be known for."},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    Hello everyone! My one first Anime review will be about the famous about this series: The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (TMoHS). \nINTRO (if not interested, skip to REVIEW)\n	Seeing as how much the overall perception and critique of the show on MAL were positive, I did told myself one thing: “This is the next show I'll be watching”. I was hyped. Not only was I very curious about TMoHS, it would be a totally new genre to me. I'm always curious about the public opinion and I like, as everyone else, to see it myself and judge it. I consider in my review the whole series.\n          \n        It won't be big of a problem since the show don't drastically change between seasons. In my opinion, it's what any sequels should do.\n	I'll start by saying my overall impression of this show. To me, TMoHS was disappointing. Not a “That's not what I was expecting” kind of disappointment, but a “Damn, this show was almost there but missed something big” kind of disappointment. Now, you might think it's because I was too hyped. First, I'm not the kind of guy that only judges a book by its cover. A good impression is useless if the rest doesn't keep up. Second, I can clearly point out the sources of my disappointments and that's mostly what I will explain in this review.\nEPISODE ORDER... WHAT???\n	If you didn't watch the show yet, you may have realized that the order of the episodes are messed up. I'm talking about the order of the show as presented on DVD (and TV?). They aren't in chronological order. Once you know that, you will ask yourself the question we all had: “Should I watch it in chronological order or not?”. To be honest, I have no idea why it was presented that way. However, if you rather have the climax to be at the end of the show (as if you won't), I'll advise you to watch it as presented, not in chronological order. You'll also have a better ending. Believe me, other than that, it has no real purpose whatsoever.\nREVIEW \nTHE GOOD\n	TmoHS starts strongly. It piques your interest in the first episode. The art is beautiful, one of my favorites, and god knows I usually don't care about that aspect. Kyon meets Haruhi Suzumiya, a weird girl that makes up with nobody. She creates a school club with him, the “SOS Brigade”.  Kyon isn't so thrilled about that, but ends up following her anyway throughout the series. Moreover, Suzumiya has a mysterious power that she doesn't know (that is the Fantasy part, between). The few other club members will end up being the rest of the “main” characters, which all have a connexion with Haruhi's mysterious power (yup, Fantasy part). The characters are all interesting, intriguing, and have their (one-sided) personality. Following Kyon being dragged into all kind of situations, with the other members of the SOS Brigade, and the mystery revolving around Haruhi will be the main entertainment of the show. TMoHS doesn't take itself seriously, but it's what makes its charm. It is fun, unpredictable, and always be motivated to watch more.\nTHE BAD\n	As I said earlier, TMoHS was disappointing. With all the job keeping your interest, it ends up not doing so much:\n --> The mystery revolving around Haruhi is not the main focus of the show. Most episodes are about school life and have no real meaning to its development. Sometimes, it seems to be more of a pretext than anything else. For example, an episode where the group plays Baseball. They play because it will prevent Haruhi's power to be prompt. In the end nothing happens. \n --> When there's no high level of action, I want at least character developments. The show barely gives sign of any development EVER, may it be throught actions or dialogue. \n --> You might think The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya will be continuous at first, but you'll realize it's episodic. The main plot is concluded, but with the fact that there's barely no character evolution, and that most episode has barely no connexion with the mysery around Haruhi, you could link the beginning with the end, and skipping everything in between. \nOVERALL\n	In the end, the show throw us a plot but doesn't exploit it. We catch a glimpse here and there thinking it might make some kind of progression, but in the end, nothing really happens. I could pretend the plot wasn't there and it wouldn't change much. If it's not the progression about the plot, it's about the characters. But, it's the same. No evolution in any characters. If you skip episodes, you will see every characters identical from before, they won't even mention any past events. Yes, there will be a climax. But, it will seem like thrown because of these facts. Even when the show sells Haruhi Suzumiya as a “weird & crazy” girl, I found her more adorable and entertaining, and it made me wonder why nobody wanted to be her friend in the first place. If you watch the show, you will understand better what I meant by “disappointment”.  I wasn't asking much, I was asking for something that would link the episodes together while giving a purpose to the plot. \n	However, from an episodic perspective, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is fun. The characters will be the main source of enjoyment and I laughed from time to time. I'm sure you will get through pretty quickly, as it is addictive. Was it Great(9) or even a Masterpiece(10)? It could've been. It was just fun, nothing more. There is better Anime out there. That's why I give it a 7(Good) which is still positive in my book (of rating). \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    To me the story appeared really convincing. It starts out with a high-school guy Kyon who meets the weird and arrogant girl Haruhi Suzumiya. He is forced to join her unrecognized SOS Brigade and the actual plot starts there. Kyon's sarcastic comments (or rather thoughts) really add fun to the entire thing. As of Haruhi, well, her arrogance might be a bit infuriating (to people like me).

Kyon who is our lead male protagonist is the point of view at which the story is told.\nTo basically sum it all up Haruhi is god, I know that might seem like a spoiler but calling her god is really a vague statement because I already knew this before watching and pretty much anyone that has already seen this show will tell you that but it really doesn't spoil much as with concept, anything can happen.\nanother good thing about this show is the sheer attention to detail, what I mean is that every thing that happens in this show, holds relevance later on so it makes every episode important, so from writer's perspective the story is pretty well thought out.\nProblems\nthe only problem I really spotted was something called the endless eight which is an 8 episode long story arc of the same thing happening over and over again as the characters are stuck in a time loop, and it gets pretty boring until they finally figure out how to get out of it.\nNOTE: this story arc does hold major importance in the movie but I would suggest skipping through it and only watch a few episodes.\nCharacters\nthe characters in haruhi kinda consisted of your typical anime cast but their unusual backgrounds make them interesting and compared to other anime characters that can be compared to them, these guy's are at least able to be unique with their own personalities.\nfirst there is Kyon, Kyon is actually a nick name and it is never revealed what his actual name is.\nmost of the anime is filled with Kyon's inner monologue and thoughts about what is going on around him. I found him to be somewhat relatable because he basically says everything that the audience would likely be thinking though he is a little over sarcastic at times, and he tends to get a little annoyed with some of the crazy things Haruhi does and is kinda like her polar opposite.\nThen there is Haruhi Suzumiya who is an extremely eccentric girl who is also god and has the entire plot around her little finger (subconsciously). Haruhi can seem like kind of a bitch some times but does have a soft side which is shown early enough that I don't hate her, she isn't a really complicated character as for many of the other characters in this series.\nThen there is Yuki Nagato who is your typical Rei Ayanami clone, but unlike Rei she is more like a robot and shows absolutely no emotion, she is basically the one that first explains what is actually going but uses a lot of technical terms which can be confusing but still remains a fan favorite.\nMikuru Asahina is your typical moe character that is usually forced to do things by haruhi, Kyon tends to hit on her a bit. She has her own take the situation but is a little confusing, but she does prove to be a useful character.\nItsuki Koizumi is one of those characters that always has his eyes closed and is kind of a smart ass but gives the best explanation to what is going on.\nI had some favorite ones that didn't get a lot of screen time, like Tsuruya who was kinda hyper and a little annoying but I liked her energy and she came up with \"Nyoro\" (which is basically YOLO)\nand above all my favorite character of this show and my top favorite villain of anything there is Ryoko Asakura...\nnow she doesn't get a lot of time to be the villain but is the only major antagonist in this show and when she is the bad guy, she completely steels the show and to me was a very unique character in this show. A lot of the time she is really just a nice girl until you see that she is a little crazy but not as the craziest yandere in anime but is powerful enough that it really doesn't matter. This girl just pulls off being a villain perfectly with almost every word and every action and is kind cute too.\nthe characters don't really get much development in this show as most of it is kinda episodic but no one is really complaining about that.\nsub vs. dub\nthis is considered one of the greatest dubs of all time and I agree with that statement, but there is a sub too, and on further inspection the sub isn't that bad.\nto be honest both are actually very good in there own respects but have more impact if you watch it in your native tongue, however I did find some interesting differences Koisumi has a really deep voice which makes some of what he says seem important in japanese while in english he is voiced by Johnny young Bosch who has a lighter voice but is a pretty good speaker.\nthat was really the only difference I found interesting the rest is pretty much 50/50 and I'm only considering that a japanese audience is watching this too but personally I liked the english better because of Asakura, as everything she says and how she says it is pure gold as I was laughing at how purely awesome she is.\nFinal verdict\nI'm gonna have to give this a 9.\nThe series ends abruptly though according to the light novels the story continues on but endless eight kind killed this anime but I would like to see it continue and perhaps even end.\nother than that there are a ton of cool episodes that reach out to a wide audience,\nStuff like mystery, sci-fi, they even have a space battle episode that reminds me of legend of the galactic heroes but that's another anime for another time."},

I was dead wrong about my initial reaction to this show.\nHaruhi is an absolute riot, and throughout the twists ans turns in the plot, I found myself laughing with the rest of them, and yet sighing with annoyance at Kyon's lack of insight to Haruhi's romantic feelings. I fell in love. It's a really good show, keeping you guessing with every episode, and yet you somehow can predict what will happen, in a good way.\nI wish there was more romance, but the meager amount of it already in there is somehow perfect for this show, so no\n          \n        real complaints there. I think that in itself (and how I wish there were more than 28 episodes in there entire series) is the reason that this show scored an overall 9, when everything else was a perfect 10. \nONe note of suggestion- watch it in the Kyon order- it may be confusing, but the last nonlinear order episode is so much more 'final' than the real last episode- trust me, you might not care up until \"The Melancholy of Harihu Suzamiya (spelling) Part 6,\" but after watching that episode last, you will truly understand why that is best left last- can you say romance???

Such and such has happened. There is Kyon, who some of his classmates call him Haruhi's \"henchman\" is the main character.

The big deal is that Haruhi has the power to change the world if she doesnt like it. That is why Yuki, Mikuru, and Itsuki are there. Haruhi has no idea of such her power. I particulary don't like Itsuki's voice in the English version of the anime, but I guess it will have to do because I can't understand Japanese and I don't like subtitles.\nOverview: AWESOME.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    The following is a review for the entire primary Haruhi series. This includes seasons 1 and 2 as well as the film.\nThere are some shows that you may watch in passing, but aren’t particularly engaged by, and there are others that you may follow to some degree, but then there are the shows that suck you in from start to finish. Where the world and characters feel so coherent and real that you find yourself completely and helplessly immersed. Shows that when they come to their conclusion, make you feel like something is suddenly missing. This is one of those shows. \nBased on the insanely\n          \n        popular series of light novels by Nagaru Tanigawa, It’s spawned many spinoffs, but most notably received an anime with two seasons and a movie, of which I’ll be talking about today. Please keep in mind that I have watched this series twice, both times in the Chronological order, so my review will be based upon that. There really is no series that can quite compare to the feeling of wonderment that this one conveys to me. I mean I’m not the type who binge watches things too often, but with Haruhi it’s near impossible not to. Sci-Fi/Supernatural Slice of Life is rarely done well, yet here it’s perfectly accomplished. The mysterious aspect to the story for once has a pretty major effect on the progression, and the plot has a sense of depth to it. Heck, I could sing praises for how well it succeeds in making an engaging experience all day, but I won’t because that would probably take really long to upload. Now, before I get sidetracked, let’s cover what I consider to be the defining factor in Slice of Lives, the characters. \nThe cast is actually feels kind of small, sporting 5 mains, though really it’s focused on only two of them in particular, and then there is a near nonexistent cast of supporting characters, many of whom only make one or two passing appearances. For the entirety of show, we follow Kyon, a completely normal high schooler who happens to befriend Haruhi, a girl who unknowingly posses godlike powers, but from whom he and his abnormal club members must hide her ability. Kyon is the perfect character to have at the forefront. He’s far off from the typical dull self-insert character, and is incredibly relatable. His snide remarks are the source of a lot of the show’s humor, and Kyon’s dialogue in general is phenomenally written. He feels like a real guy, and his reactions and inner monologue are largely responsible for this. \nKyon bears a great dynamic with our show’s namesake, Haruhi Suzumiya. It’s hard to say whether love-to-hate or hate-to-love would be the accurate term here, though I’d say both are somewhat applicable. Haruhi is a spoiled, self-important, jealous, and bossy, character, and yet somehow, I loved her. Sure, she has her bad moments, but she has her good ones as well. Her imperfections gave her depth, and made you want to watch her grow and progress. Next up is the ever robotic Yuki Nagato, an artificial life form created by the Data Integration Thought Entity for interaction with humans. She, unlike most of her counterparts, is introverted and rarely shows any display of emotion or care. Yuki might seem like a disinteresting, dull character, but oh is she so much more. From the perspective of someone having finished it a second time, there are so many subtle nods and touches that very gradually develop her character, all of it building up to her brilliant role in the Disappearance film. \nNow we have the ever mysterious esper Itsuki Koizumi. Despite being present often, he actually rarely ends up actually doing or saying much, due to the very nature of his character and the many requirements needed for the use of his powers. His sole purpose seems to be to put Kyon on edge, as well as providing the occasional confusing explanation to what’s going on around us. There’s not too much depth to him, though that is kind of the point. I can’t hate him too much either, though, as he’s responsible for some really funny lines and one of my favorite moments in the entirety of the show. \nLast, and in my ever-so-humble opinion, most definitely least, we have the quite well endowed and helpless time traveler, Mikuru Asahina. I really couldn’t find any redeeming qualities in her whatsoever. She was even more useless than Koizumi, and her “Classified Information” was annoying as ever. She never stands up for herself, she never develops, and she never really shows any display of having real character depth. There is a particular event that takes place later on that shows she does eventually change, but this was simply told to the audience, we never actually see any of her development take place. \nThe characters aside, the story holds up pretty well on it’s own as I mentioned earlier. It throws enough curveballs to never get dull or routine. The Melancholy arc is well-paced and satisfying, and the standalone episodes are very enjoyable and oftentimes quite funny. One of my favorites out of those being Live Alive. What I particularly love about the series is how if you pay close attention, there are a lot of subtle character hints littered throughout. However, there are two in the second season that are quite controversial. The infamous Endless 8, and to a lesser degree, the Sigh arc. I’ll talk about them both briefly. Endless 8. Ah, endless 8. A curious bystander might ask what exactly is this “endless 8”? To put in the simplest possible terms, it is an arc in which, due to a time loop, the same day is repeated thousands of times, wherein we see 8 of these repeats. The undiscerning eyes would think each episode exactly the same, and while the story and dialogue generally remains unchanged, all the lines are rerecorded, and it’s all been reanimated, with different shots and small changes. Some are bored by this arc, and others downright hate it, but to be perfectly honest, I didn’t mind it all that much, and I think this is partially due to a couple factors. Firstly, I legitimately really enjoy the Endless 8 episode itself. I find it incredibly relaxing and calming, so watching it several times didn’t hurt me too much. Secondly, I was not one of the unlucky few who had to suffer through watching this on a week to week basis for two entire months, so I can’t really understand the rage that others have gone through. And Thirdly, I really respect them for doing this. Do I think it should’ve been shorter? Most certainly. I’d say that 5 episodes at max would have been more than sufficient for it’s goal. I also think the ending, while in character, was ridiculously anti-climactic, and the misleading “hints” were pointless. When I rewatched the series, I watched just the first and last episode and found it to be a signifigantly more enjoyable experience. That said, enjoyable or no, I do believe that it is important to have watched endless 8 in it in it’s entirety without skipping any episodes at least once. How you feel about it will vary from person to person, but it’s a unique experience that you’ll likely never see or experience anything similar to again, and of which you really should formulate your own opinion on. I particularly like it, and many agree with me on this point in that there are a lot of subtleties to it, and the experience of watching Endless 8 in itself plays into making The Disappearance film all the more powerful. \nAnd then there is the Sigh arc. Haruhi and the group are going to make a movie, and it starts off as a typically fun and energetic arc, but gradually degrades into chaos. There is some very important character conflict that IO think had to take place for development, and while this makes for some of my favorite moments in the show during the falling action, I feel the buildup and events that caused it  in the first place could have been handled much better. Events that in any other episode would’ve been played off as “funny” were handled dramatically, and the climax felt really odd and out of place. I do think the sigh arc was necessary, but it was still very flawed. All of this builds up to the brilliant Disappearance film. It’s really quite the experience, especially since it clocks in at over two and a half hours, but I’d say it’s for good reason. It takes up a more methodical and slower pace than that of the show, but also gives an even bigger sense of depth and realism. While I would say that particularly for one rewatching it, in the first two hours or so, but moreso in the first hour, there are quite a few moments where it feels like the story has slowed down or come to a halt, and other moments of second-hand-shame that made me hide my face and pull myself out of the immersion. The second time around there’s no sense of mystery any longer to keep you fully engaged for those first two acts, so if you’re watching it the first time around I’d say to really cherish that. However, those final forty minutes, much like Clannad’s final episodes, are what makes the film. Forty minutes of brilliance, that the movie and the series have been building up to. The dialogue is phenomenal, the visuals stunning, the music perfect, everything blending together to create some of the most unforgettable moments in all of media. There is a reason everyone says Endless 8 is worth it, just for the movie. I say the buildup was slow, but I think that the buildup is largely part of the reason that the final arc is so intense. \nWith the story out of the way, let’s discuss the animation for the series. It’s done by Kyoto Animation, who I’ve come to love for their personalized and fluid character animation, and that’s certainly prevalent here. They really make Haruhi’s bubbly personality come to life, and they use a lot of interesting shot framing and perspective. Be it for more comedic purposes, like with Some Day in the Rain, or for a more subtle touch, like not showing Kyon’s reaction to Koizumi’s question in Endless 8. With season one and two, there is a fairly clear boost in the animation quality, which is pretty logical due to their being a three year break between the airing of the them. The differences aren’t major, but mainly consist of some more detailed animation and much better shading. The differences with the film however, are pretty noticeable, though that should be obvious. The Disappearance was a theatrical film, and as such has a much higher level of quality. In the original series, there were moments of pure excellence, where the animation was smooth and near-flawless, such as the famous Live Alive sequence, and the disappearance is loaded with those, particularly during the climax, which is almost entirely that. It’s even more detailed and crisp, and the use of lighting is spectacular, and overall it really helps to convey the atmosphere. My only issue I found is that while it didn’t stand out to me on my first watching session, now I noticed there is some use of CG in both the film and the show. Though it does look somewhat dated, oddly enough it somehow ‘works’ and I never found it too out of place. \nThe sound as well contributes more than I’d expect to my enjoyment. The series has some very over-the-top themes, which is actually pretty fitting for Haruhi, and while I think that they could be a little too in-your-face at times, they were incredibly memorable, and I found myself humming some of the tunes on occasion, much to my surprise. There’s a broad range of instruments used, which serves to distinguish each song on it’s own, and within the songs themselves they make use of a variety of different styles. A groovy trumpet, methodical piano, comedic drums, dramatic strings, and countless more, there’s quite a bit of depth here, and it makes me very reminiscent of the Hey Arnold soundtrack, which was similarly jazzy and broad in range. And of course you can’t ignore the fantastic vocal songs, the OPs and EDs, as well as ‘God Knows’. All of them are fantastic, but my personal favorite is the very first Opening, as it really encapsulates the aforementioned feeling of wonderment I love so much about Haruhi. The soundtrack to The Disappearance takes this already fantastic standard and goes above and beyond it. An even broader, more engrossing orchestral score that covers so many emotions fantastically, along with expanded and improved versions the themes we already loved so much in the show. I won’t dwell on this too long, as I’ve already talked about it previously, but If I had the opportunity to see any one score live in an orchestra, this one would certainly be up there.\nOn the other side of the audio, how about the dub and sub of the series? Well both are pretty darn good. Crispin Freeman did a fantastic job on Kyon, which is important considering how that’s where most of the dialogue is coming from. He expressed a really nice range of emotions and honestly is on par and perhaps even better than the original voice actor, Sugita Tomozaku. Wendee Lee did a good job as Haruhi, though you could definitely see that she improved as the show went on, and initially her speech was a little stilted, particularly during the first arc, but that issue was fazed out pretty quickly. However, I don’t think she can really compare to Aya Hirano’s fantastic role. I really can’t judge it much as I don’t speak Japanese, but I’m pretty sure about this. I did really love Johnny Yong Bosch’s interpretation of Koizumi, and I didn’t have any particular problems with the fittingly robotic voice for Nagato. One voice I really disliked in particular was the dubbed voice for Mikuru. It sounded like she was trying to talk an octave to high for her range and ended up whispering her lines, and it just made a character I already found annoying even more so. Overall I would say the sub is better, but the dub is still good enough that if you like watching things dubbed it’s certainly worth a watch, even if only for Crispin Freeman. \nHaruhi is a franchise that’s become insanely big, and for good reason. It’s a roller coaster ride of craziness, and is one you certainly won’t forget any time soon. Unique and engaging, for all it’s flaws it’s still a fantastic adventure and one I wouldn’t recommend anyone miss out on. I give The Melancholy and Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya the conglomerate score of a 9/10. \n(Originally Written December 25th, 2014)\nhttps://writtenandwriting.wordpress.com/\n        "},

It has a decent storyline (crazy, but indeed decent), and can make you laugh with it's innocent and heartwarming humour. The art is just amazing, I loved the details and light effects, but it would be way better if the soundtrack were better. The music is just shit, but it compensates with the character’s voices. Besides, I couldn't count on both hands how many times I jerked off to Asahina's tiddies. \nBut man, what the fuck were that last episodes about?\n          \n        Talk about boring. It's basically 3 whole episodes about the gang doing the exact same shit over and over and little detail about the infinite time loop they are experiencing. I hope the second season clears this up for me, for these last episodes ruined my enjoyment. \nAnyway, pretty nice chinese cartoon we have here. Strongly recommended. "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    In this review I've decided to talk about the anime as a whole with the exceptions of The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya/Yuki Nagato.\nEnjoyment: 10\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an odd show to describe. The only real way to explain why I enjoy the show in the way I do is that it’s a memory; the series was my first ever anime so I am slightly bias towards it. However, that doesn’t change the fact that it still, to this day, has a big impact on how I live my everyday life and my perception on life, my peers and the world.\nPlot: 9\nThe story revolves\n          \n        around Kyon, a completely regular high school boy who doesn’t believe in anything out of this world or supernatural. Kyon is a very interesting narrator to follow through the dramas of the series since he remains entirely disinterested and resigned throughout. His personality is most entertaining when rivalled by the outlandish oddball, Haruhi Suzumiya. Kyon is encouraged by his new friends to avoid her but happens to notice and point out a few of her strange quirks which is the start of an odd not-quite-friendship between the two. In a strange turn of events, we learn that she herself is not be what meets the eye.   \nArt and Animation: 8\nBeing made by Kyoto Animation, it’s not surprising that Haruhi has an excellent standard of animation and a beautiful art style really highlighting the beauty of the direction. The art is particularly impressive for the time and the movements are mostly smooth. \nMusic: 8\nHaruhi is a particularly good example of the expression “less is more” in terms of its use of music. While no songs of the OST particulary caught my attention, the overall tone of the music and the atmosphere it creates are fantastic. Also, the first opening, while not massively popular, is an opening I personally adore and the ending is, of course, famous within the anime community for its dance (which I do have to admit to having learnt) but is actually a very upbeat song which I feel fits the feel of the show well.\nVoices: 10\nDubbed or subbed? In my opinion it is no question. The sub, while very good, doesn’t have what the dub has: Crispin Freeman. While I wouldn’t say I’m a very big fan of his, Crispin Freeman’s portrayal of Kyon is some of the best English voice acting I have ever experienced during an anime simply because of the constant bored tone which I feel gives the show a layer that nothing else has (except for perhaps SNAFU).\nProblems and characters: \nI have very few problems with the show but if I had to give some my main problems would be:\n-	Endless Eight\n-	Unanswered questions\n-	Lacking character development for characters other than Haruhi and Nagato\n-	The last episode (if watched chronologically)\nHowever, these don’t subtract from the actual viewing of the show too much. These points are simply minor annoyances that I only really had after the show ended. I do have to admit that some of these problems where handled in The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya and, if there had been a third season, it is clear that these problems would have been solved. But, alas, due to understandable reasons that I now know of, season three is likely to never exist. I’m keeping my fingers crossed either way and I hope you will too.\n        "},

The soundtrack is catchy enough to get stuck in my head, and Haruhi is such a fun character - I would love to have a third season just to see more of her shenanigans!\nTake all of the high school anime tropes and turn them to their extreme to get \"Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu\". This is a comedic series rooted in satire but takes a life of its own with its ridiculously contrived scenarios. Ultimately, is a fun show and I would recommend giving it a try! However, it\n          \n        is definitely not a beginner anime due to its dependence on certain story-arc and character archetypes, so I would recommend not making this your first anime.\nStory [6/10]: As one of its characters points out, Melancholy follows the principle \"let sleeping gods lie\". That is to say, the show has no intention of rushing off anywhere and instead is just focused on making each arc spontaneous and enjoyable. \nPacing [5/10]: Unfortunately as stated above, the episodic nature of Melancholy renders its overall pacing glacial. Some individual episodes also suffer from explanations and monologues, but most of them find a good stride. If nothing else, the show remains captivating with its beautiful artwork.\nArt/Concept [8/10]: Melancholy is almost obsessively drawn, making it a real pleasure to watch! Moreover, the concept of the series elevates it above the average anime. It is inventive and witty.\nSound [8/10]: Like most others, the soundtrack of Melancholy is bouncy and fun. It is also slightly addictive, and adds to the experience more than most anime music.\nCharacter [6/10]: The main cast is composed of one-dimensional archetypes endowed with ridiculous sci-fi powers, thus forcing out a completely contrived second dimension to their characters. They are mostly likeable (Haruhi is a joy to watch), but are also underdeveloped, and I would have liked to see some actual relationships develop after they are thrown together.\nEnjoyment [7/10]: A short way into the series, Melancholy makes its purpose clear. It is a reminder to the audience of what anime is about: to have fun! There are no convoluted plots, and no messy love triangles. So sit back, enjoy the incredible artwork and ridiculous situations, and remember that Haruhi always wins.\nOverall: [7.5/10]\n        "},

Yes, there are so many chronological orders that this show offered. The first thing I hate about this show is how jumbled their episodes are. Anyways, here is the Season 2 Broadcasting order.\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya I\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya II\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya III\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya IV\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya V\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya VI\nThe Boredom of Haruhi Suzumiya\nBamboo Leaf Rhapsody\nMysterique Sign\nLone Island Syndrome I\nLone Island Syndrome II\nEndless Eight\nEndless Eight\nEndless Eight\nI will review the other half\n          \n        at the Season 2 of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya very soon.\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a very unique show. There are a lot of aspects to this show that other anime hasn't show off. However, sometimes, being unique doesn't mean, everyone enjoys the show.\nThe story is about a time where Haruhi Suzumiya's wishes comes true. She wished for an alien, time-traveler and an esper (Also, obviously, she also wished for Kyon being on her side).\nI don't really see any problem with the story although it does leave me with a lot of question. What's the goal of the story? Are they just going to show off Haruhi Suzumiya's imagination?\nSince I watched it in Season 2 Broadcasting order, episode 14 left as a cliffhanger so, I scored the Story an 8/10.\nYes, I know, you would speak about the \"Endless Eight\" but, that arc shows on how unique the show is and it made sense.\nYou have to give props to KyoAni for once again, they were able to show off on how much budget they have. The powers between Espers and Aliens were really executed well. Also, speaking of the \"Endless Eight,\" I am surprised how they really have the budget to repeat each episode. Oh, it's not even a literal replay. It shows off the same dialogue and action but with different angles and a little difference of clothing, actions, etc. depending on the time loop.\nThe soundtrack is also great. It really pulls off well with the comic-reliefs and the mystery parts of the show. The first opening was incredibly catchy although, the second opening was not that bad but, not that great. It was decent.\nThe characters of this show are indeed enjoyable. All of them gives you a light feeling while watching this show. Kyon is just living in a normal high-school life, Suzumiya being such an exciting girl. Nagato being so quiet and doesn't speak unless you talk to her (And give her orders), Koizumi being a guy who just smiles and does whatever he wants. I gave it an 8 though because these characters can be boring and frustrating at times and it is noticeable a lot in the Endless Eight.\nEDIT: Nope. 9/10. I actually enjoyed the characters...\nDespite the unique aspects of the show, I fairly enjoyed it. Everything was actually great but the Endless Eight killed the enjoyment. I don't appreciate all unique aspects because being unique doesn't mean it's really good. The only thing I enjoyed about the show is it's comedy and how it was story-driven... until the Endless Eight came.\nEDIT: No. Actually, the second time I watch this show, I enjoyed it.... Wow...  Of course, I still hate the Endless Eight.\nIt is safe to watch this show but, the build up of the story and the Endless Eight might (Or will) bore you. If you have reached to the Endless Eight and you don't like repetitive parts, just watch Part 1 then skip to Part 8. However, in my part, I want to watch it and I don't want to skip any parts. Maybe to get some character development. Hopefully, those character development won't go to waste by the time I finish the show.\nScore: 8/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Before I get started I just want to say, I'm so sorry if this seems like a long review xD :It may also contain spoilers but I tried my best to keep them out:\nFirst off, Wow, just wow, this anime was one hell of a ride. This anime really did contain so many genres, bounding into one, which created it into an amazing enjoyable anime to watch. But of course it does have its flaws like every anime out there. One of the main things that impressed me about this anime was that, it was always ready to keep going and make the person watching\n          \n        it, enjoy and want to keep on watching it and wanting more of it. Which in my opinion led onto the movie. In this anime you get to see, action, comedy, romance, slice of life and even sci fi in some ways. The art style is very good, but could be a little better in some scenes. The characters have their own personality's of course, from, moe to kuudere, to laid back characters and even god herself. These characters really make you want to know more about them and the anime did well on you showing you more of what type of characters they are. \nThe story of this anime was very exiting, there is the main male protagonist, Kyon. Which isn't actually his real name, nobody knows what it is. And I guess you could say he gets dragged into a girls other type of world. A world where she gets what she wants, and anything can happen. And that girl would be the other main character Haruhi. And she also brings other people into this world that she had created of her own. All the characters are taken on this \"haruhi\" adventure that is full of craziness and it just makes you fell like you're on that crazy adventure too. \nThe characters are like I said, the type that make you want to know more about them. First off you have Kyon who is a laid back type of character who just goes about his everyday life until one day, hes taken away from that and instead had developed a much for fun exiting life thanks to Haruhi. And Haruhi, is the one who makes it all happen. She seems to think that there is no fun in life at all, so Kyon gave her the idea to make the thing that she had been looking for which was a club. The SOS Brigade. Since she has this god like power to have whatever she wants and, pretty much control the world. She can never know that she has that type of power because she is kind of crazy and would do something very dramatic. For example going far as blowing up the world. Haruhi wanted to have an alien, a time traveler and an espier in her club, which leads us up to the kuudere like character, Yuki. Yuki is the alien of the group who had been sent down to earth. She is silent character who we don't really see much of apart from the rare fight scenes that appear. Yuki is definitely a character who you want to know more about, fortunately you see a lot more of her in the movie. Yuki also had to put up with a lot of crazy things Haruhi did, she also had to repeat an extremely long period of time just because Haruhi felt that summer vacation just wasn't enough fun. Mikuru is your typical moe character who is the time traveler. She had been forced into the club by Haruhi, but it is still Mikurus duty and the other characters duty to keep Haruhi from going out of control she also has to put up with some embarrassing things that Haruhi makes her do. Lastly we have Koizumi. I would call him the cool type of character who sort of bonds things together you can also see him as rather two faced but non the less he is still a very important character. \nOverall, I The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya will always be one of my all time favourites for its amazing story line and its on going entertainment. It is definitely something any otaku or anime lover would love :) \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    This series is downright hilarious at points. What makes the humor work so well is its sublime combination of weird science fiction and realistic high school comedy. In one episode, the brigade will have to save the world from Haruhi's boredom, the next episode they'll be playing a baseball game. The jokes here are varied, and range from very subtle wordings to limited (thank god) use of fanservice comedy (along with some very funny 4th wallbreaking everytime they do it.) The comedy in Haruhi is something all anime fans will find something funny in.\nAnother big part of the shows success is the characters. All of\n          \n        the characters are really unique and each bring a nice element of surprize and familiarity to the show. Everyone here is likeable, even the side characters that appear in maybe 2-3 episodes in the series so far. At the end of the day, you realize how fun it would be if you were friends with this cast of characters.\nThere is one issue with Haruhi I have, and this may or may not be important depending on who you are. One of the things I still just to do not understand is why this show is broadcast out of chronological order. I tried watching it first in the broadcast order, and what would happen is I would get confused at the end of every episode trying to think where this episode is in the timeline of the show. Personally, it makes things for me unnecessarily complicated while watching it. However, as I watched the episodes in chronological order, I felt relieved not having to put together an unnecessary puzzle.\nFor once in these reviews, I can actually talk about the dub since half of the episodes I have seen were the dub. The dub in short is REALLY DAMN GOOD. Wendee Lee plays Haruhi, Crispin Freeman is Kyon, Stephanie Seph is Mikuru, Michelle Ruff is Yuki, and Johnny Yong Basch is Itsuki. All of their voices are perfect for their characters, and even the side characters are cast excellently. The translation of the humor is also really good, keeping all of the subtle nuiances. It will probably be funnier if you have an understanding of Japanese culture, but still hilarious either way.\nIn conclusion, Haruhi is the funniest anime I have seen in recent memory. It does a great job of creating its own universe outside the typical another day in the high school life comedy animes, and establishes characters you really want to see more of. At the end of 14 episodes, you'll be begging for more, I know I was.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Honestly, I made an account JUST to review this anime and tell everyone to watch it.\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (TMOHS) has got to be one of my favorite animes ever. I know lots of people dislike this one for whatever reason (lack of character development, weird airing order, etc. etc. ) However, TMOHS definitely stands out as one of the best -- especially when viewers go beyond the direct story and characters and try to understand the messages presented. This is actually one of the very few animes that made me think and added meaning to my life.\nANIMATION-\nIn terms of animation, I really like\n          \n        the art -- the characters are pretty (I'm a bit shallow in that respect) and the scenery/landscapes are well done with pretty good lighting. Sound wasn't a problem for me, but then again, I never pay that much attention. Voice actors were pretty good and really brought out the personalities of the characters.\nPLOT- \nThe plot is actually quite interesting given the nature of the story. It's a comedy/slice of life/sci fi anime (odd combination) that somehow keeps you interested. You might get lost watching it in airing order, but I decided to watch it in chronological order and didn't have much problem making sense of things. Watchers can relate to the everyday experiences of Haruhi and Kyon and the SOS Brigade and yet still feel a sense of excitement and curiosity for what's happening next due to the brilliantly interwoven sci-fi aspects. From aliens studying autoevolution to time travelers investigating a strange phenomenon to ESPers worshiping a new god, TMOHS manages to bring in diverse and frankly strange characters who interact in daily activities -- from video games to baseball matches to summer vacations. The juxtaposition of the mundane with the supernatural keeps the plot exciting and fresh -- indeed, anything can happen next.\nCHARACTERS (this will be quite lengthy as I believe the characters are very deep)-\nThis seems to be the biggest criticism of TMOHS -- that the show lacks significant character development. However, I must strongly disagree with this point. What TMOHS lacks in character development , it more than makes up with character DEPTH. Those who believe there is a lack of character depth are not appreciating the subtlety of the personalities. Instead of deliberately having characters break down or something, TMOHS reveals a deeper side to the characters through the every day actions they perform. Moreover, whereas some may claim the show lacks development, it would be difficult to argue against the simply fascinating way the different characters interact, as mentioned, and approach everyday situations.\nHaruhi is one of my favorite anime characters ever. Her pushy, super-hyper, has-to-have-her-way personality immediately pushes her to the center of any story. Her inexhaustible energy makes her lovable and memorable and manifests itself even more evidently in her relationship with the bored, laid-back Kyon. Beyond her cheerful exterior, Haruhi is probably one of the deepest characters in the series -- one can never shake off the tinge of melancholy emanating from her personality. She deals with the same issues that the youth of today's society do: a feeling of insignificance, a longing for adventure, a desire to break the mundane, a search for friendship and love. Despite her cheerfulness, she still maintains a sense of loneliness, adding a very real dimension to her seemingly simple personality. She possesses a very distinct identity and her sadness makes the viewers want to reach out and help her -- almost as if she were real.\nNagato is probably my second favorite character in the show. Though people may think of her as the stereotypical calm, collected, emotionless character so prevalent in animes, I personally think she transcends the role. In a way, she reminds me of Rei from Evangelion; there's just something more about her blank face. Along with her interesting background, one cannot help but be confounded by her. Nagato, to me, is the wise and patient one; she seems to be omnipresent, yet silent, as if letting the others learn on their own would teach them better. Moreover, there's also a sense of melancholy from her. Though not exactly the same as Haruhi's, her sadness seems to emerge from her lack of emotions and distance from others. She always makes me wonder what it would be like in her shoes: so knowledgeable and yet so impersonal and far from warmth and affection. Her persona makes viewers feel cold and distanced and yet, somehow, makes the viewer attached to her.\nPeople seem to dislike Kyon for his static nature. Though I admit he may not be on the same level as Haruhi in terms of depth, he still struggles for understanding in a very confusing world. He is naive, in a sense, but possesses very real literary significance. Like Nick Carraway from The Great Gatsby (classic novel, btw), Kyon makes TMOHS that much more interesting because of his narration and his commentary. He serves less to provide astounding insight than he does to reflect on the situation and help viewers understand others. As a normal human, Kyon definitely puts TMOHS into perspective as he marvels at the surreal experience and tries to wrap his head around the complex science involved. In a sense, Kyon represents all of us in our attempt to deal with reality and make sense of it all.\nItsuki seems to be that cheerful, knowledgeable guy we all know in our lives. While I won't go into too much detail, I definitely believe he's a lot deeper than people give him credit for. His role seems to be expanding on the philosophy present and providing thoughtful insight into what's happening. His character really makes people think. \nAsahina, to me, is the only really flat character (not an innuendo --  in fact she's anything but flat in that sense). The typical clumsy, shy girl in animes, she sometimes makes me think she's just there for fan service. Yet, beyond that, she still does offer some interesting commentary of human nature -- especially the feeling helplessness present in blindly following orders without questioning authority. \nPHILOSOPHY AND SCIENCE-\nTo me, this aspect REALLY makes TMOHS unique. Very few animes are so deeply involved with philosophy and science. This part is often overlooked by viewers simply searching for a good story or a laugh or whatnot, but I think it's definitely underrated and deserves more attention. TMOHS makes us question what reality really is -- from its superstitious events to the presentation of theories such as the Anthropic Principle. It provides an interesting set-up and view on the nature of God. It delves into humanity and individuality and the meaning of life. Specifically, when Itsuki gives an example of a world without Haruhi, the anime gets into Nietzsche and his existential nihilism and makes us wonder: what would happen if we killed God, you and I, what would the meaning be if he didn't exist, etc. etc. TMOHS also offers a subtle, but definitely present, idea on determinism in relation with the will of God -- perhaps making us rethink the role of free-will in our actions. In terms of science, TMOHS deals with the nature of time, asserting that it is not linear, but in fact dimensional in itself without any real continuity, making us question how time really works. Perhaps time actually can be a vector and goes beyond the simply forward backward direction. It portrays interesting time travel phenomena that sometimes make your head spin. The science goes even deeper with the possibility of a multiverse and the existence of alternate realities that Haruhi can control. It deals with autoevolution and the ability of humans to select traits they desire (symbolized by Haruhi's ability to manipulate reality), perhaps offering insight into eugenics. It deals with the physics of information and data with Nagato, offering a peek into the future with manipulation of the information in our environment.\nThe science and philosophy involved are very deep and advanced. The applications and extrapolations of the messages and possibilities presented in TMOHS are endless and really makes the viewer wonder why we are here and where we are going with reality. \nSUMMARY-\nTMOHS is definitely one of the best animes ever. I would STRONGLY, STRONGLY recommend watching it.  Between the great art and animation, interesting comedy/slice of life/sci fi plot that makes you wonder what would happen next, very deep characters that interact in unique and interesting ways, insightful messages and reflections on human nature, and very deep philosophy and advanced science, what's there not to like? If you need just ONE reason to watch it, watch it because it makes you think, it makes you wonder, it makes you question reality, question life, question who you are and where you're going. Watch it because it reaches out and grabs you out of your seat, pulls you into the story, and adds some depth and some meaning to your everyday life.  \n        "},

I However found myself in the unusual position of finding The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya to be just \"ok\". Maybe a little better than average.\nIf I had to compare this show to one other, it would be like watching only the happy, carefree moments of Higurashi(if you havnt seen this show I highly reccomend it btw, a 10/10 if ever there was one). And the mysterious plots and supernatural themes\n          \n        further link those two animes. However where Higurashi delves into much darker areas in between its lighthearted moments, bringing forth character development and a fascinating plot, Haruhi no Yuutsu simply felt \"shallow\" for lack of a better word throughout the series.\nThe characters are not original, despite what anyone else may say, \"The cute ditsy girl\", \"The apathetic, emotionless girl\" \"The nice guy\" and the two leads: \"The spunky girl\" and \"The straight man\"\nThough none of these characters are particularly original(save for the main protagonists, who 'slightly' deviate from their molds on rare occasion), I DID find myself enjoying the entire cast despite myself, just because youve seen it before dosnt mean it aint funny(for myself in any case)\nArt and sound were impressive, if you enjoy high quality animation Haruhi no Yuutsu wont dissapoint.\nWhich brings us to story...Well, its \"original\" I'll give it that much. I personally found the plot to be severely lacking, it was more like an excuse for the gang to get into crazy, non-connected situations. And on top of everything it made little to no sense.\nHOWEVER despite poor character and plot, I still found myself enjoying this anime. Much more than I wouldve thought in fact. The groups crazy activities, the funny, if unoriginal cast, and the great animation made up for any shortcomings IMHO.

Everywhere you turn, you see a Haruhi avatar, or stumble upon a raging KyoAni fanboy's blog post about how stupid Endless Eight is. And you're probably thinking, \"What the hell is a Kyon-kun denwa?\" Seitokai no Ichizon also made a parody reference to it. With all this publicity, you can't help but think, \"I should really watch this anime, just to see what it's about. It's probably going to be awesome!\", right? Well...it actually depends on your sense of humor, enjoyment, and...well everything really. About 60% of\n          \n        anime watchers like/love it, 25% hate it and consider it overrated, and 15% don't actually like it, but give in to peer pressure and just say that it's great. \nTL;DR? Short version: It might not be your cup of tea. \nThe story follows a boy named Kyon, who had long since given up on his dream of witnessing paranormal activity. That is, until he meets Haruhi Suzumiya, who forms a club to look for anything supernatural (that's right, Haruhi isn't the main character). The club itself is pretty ironic, since Haruhi is thought of to have powers equal to that of a god, and is made up of a time traveler, an alien, and an esper. The main formula for a generic Haruhi episode is:\n1. The first half of an episode disguises itself as a routine slice of life anime\n2. There is some talk about some alien/esper/time traveling stuff\n3. Cool fantasy/supernatural things happen. \n2. and 3. can be interchangeable or combined. \nThe art is very good, something you'd expect from Kyoto Animation. There are abstract camera angles aplenty, and the lighting is very vivid. The effects are also well done and succeed in giving it a supernatural feel at times. The animation is very much like KyoAni's other project, Clannad, except the lines in TMoHS are sharper and the characters are drawn differently, for a less shojo-ish style and more for a general style. \nThe characters...meh, what can I say. There is really little to no character development. Kyon is very laidback, witty, and satirical. Haruhi is very hyperactive. Mikuru is your typical moe type that gets raped in almost every episode (it's by Haruhi though, so it's funny), and Yuki is a Ayanami Rei copy - silent, unless she needs to talk. \nLIke I said before, the enjoyment of the series depends on what your sense of humor is. The story is told from Kyon's point of view, so if you think that his wittiness and satirical humor is funny, then you'll enjoy this series. If you get annoyed by his \"No I don't want to do anything Haruhi tells me to but I'll do it anyways but I'll whine and make witty comebacks to everything she says. And I'll always look pissed when I'm doing anything with Haruhi, which is all the time. But anything Mikuru does is so kawaii that I can't help but smile for 3 seconds before I go back to looking pissed.\" ...then don't bother with the series.\n        "},

Its great to see an anime that makes you feel that you exist in it. the kind of muusic that imerses you to the story. and not just the ambience itself. the \"Character Songs\" are quite swell to hear too. and of course that one popular song throught the fandom \"Hare Hare Yukai\"\nCHARACTER\nCharacter are kind off..well, generic. We have the typical \"Moe\", the typical silent yet \"bad-ass\" on her hidden side. that one annoying tsundere who secretly like the main character.the\"charming\" character (I swear at first glace, i thought he was gay) and the \"normal\" main character .\nOVERALL:\nOverall, its great, great but not a masterpiece 9/10\n\n"},

She looks like an ordinary and beautiful girl at first glance but when she started to open her mouth you would take back the good things you said to her. During their class introduction, she stated that she isn't interested in ordinary humans and prefer to meet theoretically unbelievable beings such as aliens, time travelers, espers and sliders. All of her classmates are dumb struck and doesn't know if she's joking or not! No one even bothered to know what's going on inside her head until her seatmate,\n          \n        Kyon, started talking to her. Her oblivious, obnoxious and arrogant behavior and also her cute face drew Kyon closer to her.

The animation of this top-notch because the backdrops and object are surprisingly well drawn for a character driven series. Both the animation and voice acting are nicely done which makes this a must watch. This anime is a must see for it really is a masterpiece. Oh!!! I forgot to mention the ending sequence of this series is a well choreographed one and another plus for animation because the movements are flawless and also the song it's very catchy. Based on Tanigawa Nagaru's visual novel, art by Noizi Ito, KyoAni goes all out in this highly addictive series...the surreal madness just draws you in before you know it, you're already mired in the depths of inevitable absurdness!!

She asks him to help her make a club to search for this phenomena, he reluctantly agrees. They soon coincidently come across three students: an alien, an esper and a time traveller.

You have Haruhi the loud, bossy lead, Kyon the lazy, slacker who has to put up with her doings and  Mikuru the typica big boobed, moe character. as well as Koizumi the mysterious one who just sits there smiling, and Yuki the quiet, bookworm who has an amazing secret.\n The art is easily recognisable and detailed each characters design is original and fits there personality. Although this anime may not have particularly stunning scenery they have done there best to make a high school look appealing an interesting!\n Overall i think Suzumiya Haruhi No Yuutsu is  really brilliant, high school anime with a supernatural twist.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    So many people have already reviewed this very popular anime, but I guess I can give it a try too. \nStory: 8/10\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, at first glance it seems like an average slice of life comedy, but it isn't. \nKyon is a High School Freshman who have stopped to believe in the supernatural, such as aliens, espers and time-travelers to begin a normal life. But when he meets a odd girl named Haruhi Suzumiya, his life becomes far from normal. Together, with three other students, they form a new club. SOS Brigade. \nThe plot is very unique and is filled with so many\n          \n        genres, such as sci-fi, mystery and a little bit of action. Some times it can be quite confusing, but you get around it eventually. The only negative thing I have to say about this point is that it didn't progress as much as I wanted to. The SOS Brigade didn't get involved in so many supernatural missions, which is why it was formed in the first place. Even so, I managed to enjoy the story and got finally a grip of it. Most of the episodes I laughed the whole time. It was very interesting and exciting, I never got extremely bored - or bored at all actually. \nOne thing that may confuse the watchers when they watch this anime for the first time is how the arcs are divided. First, in broadcast order, then the chronological order and last the DVD order. I recommend to watch the entire series two or three times in those different orders. \nArt: 10/10\nYep, a perfect 10! The animation is the reason why I started to watch this series. It's really one of its kind and Kyoto Animation really pulled it off great. The colors are easy to the eye and it adds so many details. There aren't so many animes who can deliver such a great quality, especially for a school themed series. The characters are drawn in a very nice way, which gives away most of their personality right away. Their movements are smooth and realistic, I didn't notice so many flaws at all. \nOpening and Ending are also very good animated. I just love the scene when they dance Hare Hare Yukai, it's one of my favorites. \nSound: 9/10\nThe voice-acting is why I'm giving this category a 9. It fits the characters perfectly and have a nice feel to it - both the english dubbed and original version. Kyon's voice acting must be my favorite. The way he narrate through the story always gives me a good laugh. While many people may get annoyed at Mikuru's voice, I quite like it. It's cute, sometimes so cute I smile and have to go back just to hear funny little sounds again. Though, it can get a little bit annoying at some times. \nThe songs that were played was catchy and good, God Knows and Bouken Desho Desho is two examples. The BGM wasn't that good though. I got the feeling it wasn't original. It had its moments where they were played at the perfect time and got you excited. But I can't say I liked it. \nCharacters: 7/10\nThe characters are likeable, funny, cute, some you can even relate yourself to. There is one problem though: they're stereotypical. They only one who really stood out was Haruhi. It was quite an enjoyment to see when she bosses around with Kyon and Mikuru. In the beginning I thought she was kind of bitcy and uninteresting, but when the development started to kick in I changed my mind about her. Kyon is the ironic and the only \"normal\" guy in the club. Yuki is the quiet and mysterious bookworm. Mikuru is the fanservice and moe character. And so we have Itsuki, the \"happy-go\" guy with the long dialogs. They're likeable, but not unique. \nEnjoyment: 9/10\nDespite the confusing parts, I really enjoyed this series to the fullest. This is one of the few I can hanclle to watch over and over again without getting tired of it. I laughed many times during the episodes and I liked their messed up adventures. I just wished this series was longer than just 14 episodes. \nOverall: 9/10\nBefore I watched this series, I thought it was overrated and not so special. But then I gave it a try one week ago and it blew up my mind as soon as I got into it. It could have been better characters, the story could have been better and the same thing goes with the music. Overall, it's still a great anime and is definitely a must-watch!\n        "},

Random stuff when it's planned 6 book in advance is not that random, I think .  \n Haruhi is one of my prefered anime but I must admit that I watched it first in 2006 and almost all writing trick that was good in it  are now over used.

This one, however, is hard to do that with.  By looking at it I should hate it.  It seems to have no plot and no real story line.  It seems to be about a teenaged girl who is way out and left, the type I try to avoid at all hazards.  But from the first episode it had me.  What got me is it is your typical high school slice-of-life or maybe a\n          \n        high school romance but it turns into so much more.  Every thing we no to be true in our world, and Kyon's world, is turned on it's head in just a few episodes.  The reason I like this so much is the mystery of why it is all happening.  After watching a few episodes I just set back and enjoyed the ride.\nThe characters, on the outside just seemed to be normal every day high school students but turn out to be so much more.  The fact that Haruhi is kept in the dark about her club members true identities and purpose just makes it that much more fun to watch.\nThe art is what I have come to expect from Kyoto Animation and Kadokawa Pictures.  Very clean very well executed.\nSound was excellent.  With Aya Hirano singing the opening and closing credits and just the back ground music set the tone for the series.\nThe story was very well thought out.  It is a near perfect mixture of several classic anime themes.\nPut this all together and you have a different type of experience that what you were expecting when you first set down to watch it  All said well worth the time to check it out and watch it."},

She gets a bunch of friends into a club she made with the objective of finding aliens or anything exciting. \nSo yeah that's kinda what the story. It does sound boring but its not. Its entertaining, mainly due to the main female character. She somehow absorbs you since she's that type of character\n          \n        you just can't dislike. Its mainly due to her outgoing, funny, bossy, caring attitude. \nNow the male protagonist is the opposite, laid back, no athletic ability type of guy.

Well, I think you should. The story is good but not great, its enough to keep you wanting more, I was pulled in more from all the different characters. There are other characters that you will be able to relate to, and I believe this is how the anime did so well.\nThe music is great too that is a plus.\n"},

I'm not certain that I would have loved this as a manga, but in an animated form I really loved it. As a film student, I was particularly impressed with the innovative method of story telling and the first episode, which I think was just sensational.\n*****SPOILER*******\nI have never seen an animated feature that was directed as a student film before and I thought it was both clever and brilliantly done. The angling and \"film-making\" were both truly realistic and even though it was just for fun, it was great how it ties\n          \n        into the plot later on as the anime's episodes are not in the sequential order of events that take place in the plot, which I loved and thought it really worked in favor of this particular anime.\n\n*****END OF SPOILER*****\n\nA warning, for those very few who have yet to view this cinema: \n1. Nothing is in order. Watch it the way it was intended to be watched, then watch the 'second season' to see it lineal story line. It makes all the difference. It makes it wonderful.\n2. Be prepared to be wildly entertained and engaged. This is one crazy ride and Haruhi brings a house down. You may feel you can move mountains by the end of an episode, as her enthusiasm and endurance for life is contagious. Everything becomes an interest and nothing can be boring when she is around, because in a way, she IS the embodiment of Life. Believe me when I say she can make any chore into a game. Not unlike a certain duo from Hunter x Hunter.\nBut wait, you might ask, why only an \"8\" then if it's so EPIC?\nOf course no show is without it's weaknesses. For example, I can't help but love the characters, except that they are *all* stereotypical. And when I thought they might be more complex than they seemed, it turned out they weren't. It wasn't exactly a major let down, because I still liked them a great deal and didn't require them to be more meaningful than slice-of-life, but it felt as the series developed that there might be something more to it, and it turned out that while the finish was big, it wasn't all that impressive after all. Basically, while I like this anime a great deal, in the end it became somewhat prosaic for me to watch.\nIronically, the major weakness for me was in the plot. Not the actual day-to-day plot, which is great fun for slice-of-life and comedy, but the development of the resolution and ending of the series, which is more basic than one is led to believe and felt a bit more patched together than the rest of the show to me. Which is a shame for such a well put together show, but it really was the storytelling that won me over in the end.\n With these \"weaknesses\" if one must call them that, there are obviously some major strengths as well. I really liked the music, because it is fun and frisky and makes me want to dance. And the animation is just brilliant as I said before. I think it must take a certain amount of talent to draw so many odd angles and they did a bang up job. \nAll I will say is if nothing else - just watch the first episode. This is one of the most brilliantly, originally directed anime I have EVER seen. There is no category for the directional aspect in the ratings, but if there were it would receive a 12 for that alone. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    First, in my review, I'm referring to the anime as a whole and not just the first season.\nI chose to start watching this anime for two reasons: I just got done watching Ghost in the Shell and after watching something so complex and suspenseful I just wanted to watch something simple; when I read the summary for this anime I didn't really know what to expect because I've never heard of an anime sounding so ordinary so my curiosity was peaked. \nFor the most part this is a pretty ordinary anime about teenagers just experiencing high school; it's not like some animes e.g. Bleach, Sailor\n          \n        Moon, Kekkaishi, etc. where the characters are living double lives. However, while I usually hate high school drama, I actually really like the characters in this anime. \nUsually in high school dramas, you have the popular kids and the unpopular kids and the unpopular kids are always the main characters and the popular characters are always the antagonist, but Haruhi doesn't care what other people think of her ideas, no matter how crazy they are. \nHarui Suzumiya has actually become my new favorite anime character. What I love about her is how she always seems to have an idea of something she wants to do on her mind and she'll do whatever it takes to get what she wants. Seriously, this character will stop the sun from rising if she wants to. Also, I think it's hilarious how Harui never asks other people's opinions, how she just tells people what to do and before they can say no she gets them working. \nKyon is another character I love because him and Harui argue like an old married couple. Kyon's responsible, Harui's irresponsible, Kyon's a kill joy, Harui's the life of the party. Also, Kyon's the narrator of the anime which I think is really creative because we can hear his inner thoughts about things. Also, Kyon is the only person brave enough to say no to Harui.\nI don't want to give anything away, but let's just say this anime is full of surprises and every once in a while it crosses into the twilight zone.\nThe only thing I don't like about this anime is that there really isn't any romance between Harui and Kyon. It's one of those situations where you keep saying \"just kiss each other, it's so obvious you love each other\". However, this is a slice of life anime and by definition the story is centered around only a particular time in characters lives so maybe the writers wanted to hint at that in the future, after the anime ends, Harui and Kyon get together then. \nOverall, I really enjoyed watching this anime; I laughed some, I was almost constantly surprised, and I love the characters. I suppose why I didn't give it a 10 out of 10  was because I find slice of life animes a little boring and, while I love the characters, I didn't enjoy the story too much.\nSide Comment: Koizumi's eternal smile may be the creepiest thing ever. Stop smiling all the time and feel something other than happy!"},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    I sat down to watch a nice, calming, slice of life anime, and my God was I wrong.\nThis is show that manages to present a well written thriller-esque story line whilst maintaining the façade of a slice of life anime, meaning it’s thrilling in parts and relaxing in others. The anime goes from the main characters doing a class project as a team, to fighting giant blue monsters in another dimension, and the transition between these parts are almost seamless. However it is let down by potholes in the story line, unholy amounts of filler episodes, and large gaps between the most entertaining parts, resulting\n          \n        in much left to be desired.\nThe largest problem with this series is the lack of consistency and characterisation which means it takes a while for the anime to get going. Although the transitions between a calm school life anime and a crazy thriller involving “quantum this through the nth dimension of that” are entertaining and keep us on our toes the timing of these jumps is a tad sketchy to say the least. The thriller-esque parts are far too short and occur far too little, meaning you’re left watching five episodes of school kids running around whilst waiting for the giant blue monster to show up to smack them about a bit. Don’t get me wrong slice of life is great, and the long parts that don’t involve much action can be very entertaining, especially with Kyon’s (the male lead) sarcastic undertones taking the mick out of the process but too often are you stuck with long drawn out filler episodes that don’t seem to have anything to do with plot development and at the very least only allow for little character development, of which there is almost none regardless. Character development rarely happens, and if it does it’s only really to Kyon, a little bit to Haruhi (the namesake, and female lead). But the worst part of the entire series by far is what fans have dubbed the “Endless Eight”. This is, as the name suggests, eight episodes in series two that are all the same. To no extent am I exaggerating, all eight are the same bar some minor differences such as clothing and a slight change in the story at the end of each episode. Seriously check it out it’s crazy.\nNow something really needs to be discussed in greater detail, the plot development, there is none, and there isn’t that classic curve where the story starts of mundane and gets more exciting before reaching a climax and cooling down resolving loose ends. The series doesn’t even have that sheer kick ass factor that allows us to dismiss a non-existent plot and character development that Cowboy Bebop or Fooly Cooly had. The curve, if you will, for this series is constantly moving up and down meaning there is no true climax (apart from this weird thing half way through series one) and you’re left feeling unsatisfied by the end. The end as far as the end is concerned could have been any one of the filler episodes featured throughout the entire series and you wouldn’t notice. The “mini” climaxes that occur throughout the series, however, are brilliantly done. At parts (well one very specific part in particular) I was literally on the edge of my seat. And because the series is so cleverly disguised as a slice of life anime when the large plot twists occur it’s so shocking you’ll be gasping for air. \nBut overall The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an exciting wolf in sheep’s clothing that needs a little more work on its plot. It’s entertaining, quite funny in parts especially where Kyon and girls are considered, and the supporting cast of characters do provide a refreshing line up for the various adventures they get up to. The ending is very non-climatic but hey the ride there was quite entertaining.\nIf you do watch this show now for the love of god don’t watch it in the released order, go for the chronological order otherwise you won’t enjoy this anime as much as you should.\n\nPremise: 8/10\nThe idea this anime is based around is spectacular and, ignorant of the individual components of this anime, the mix up of different genres is a refreshing and exciting idea.  \nPlot Development: 5/10\nThe plot development in this anime is terrible as a whole, as a result of the afore mentioned lacking of a climax  and a kick ass factor to allow you to ignore the lacking of a climax, but there are some moments when you just can’t stop watching and there are some amazing twists.\nAnimation: 7/10\nThe animation is this anime is good, but it’s nothing special. The only time the animation shines is during the heavy action scenes and during the intro and outro. Overall the whole thing is good, but there are some choppy moments, and it definitely isn’t a masterpiece in regards to animation.\nCharacters: 6/10\nThe line-up of characters provides a funny backbone for the series, but aside from the main leads in total the line-up can be frustrating and boring at times.\nCharacter Development: 4/10\nThis is the only aspect of this anime that is actually bad, character development in this type of show is one of the driving forces to it, and it’s the area you rely on when the show is in-between thriller like parts. It’s what provides the backbone of the slice of life element. But unfortunately there is none whatsoever. At one point you think the two leads have started to develop but it backtracks the very next episode leaving you feeling unfulfilled.\nFluidity: 5/10\nThis show is strange to the affect that during the thriller-esque scenes it runs smoothly and alternates between thriller and slice of life seamlessly. But apart from those few times the show is jumpy. It builds up to events that don’t transpire and leaves you hanging.\nMusic: 7/10\nThis is one of the redeeming features of this anime. The music is well written and complements the scenes perfectly allowing for a light upbeat feel. And the intro and outro set the feeling for the anime perfectly. Although there is no problem with the music it could be better and more fitting, but overall I can’t complain.   \nIntro: 8/10\nThe two intros for this anime are very good, and the balance of the music and animation help to set the scene for the anime perfectly. It’s upbeat and puts you in a good mood.\nOutro: 9/10\nThe outro is hilarious and during the sadder episodes allows you to finish the anime feeling good. The second outro isn’t as good as the first one, ignorant of the annoying song (well it’s annoying after about the first 50 times…).\nPersonal Enjoyment: 8/10\nAlthough there are a lot of let downs throughout this anime overall it’s fun and exciting.\n\nTotal: 6.7/10 (Fine)\nStuart Macdonald \n(Note: This blog is not the main blog and origin of these posts, the main blog can be found at: http://theanimelistreview.blogspot.co.uk/)"},

The events and humour are random, the characters are awesome and the story is fun. \nI watched this series in chronological order, not airing order, and I'm not sure if or how that would change perspective, but it probably does. It's hard to talk about the story because of it's randomness. The actual story arc focuses around the first 6 (chronological, not aired) episodes. The rest of the series employs random humour and more character development, especially for Haruhi. It combines humour, supernatural happenings, emotions and story in a really wonderful way. \nCharacter: \nPerhaps the\n          \n        best quality of the show are the characters. Kyon, unlike many male characters in his position, is a really great character. He narrates the story when needed, and tries to be the voice of reason in the group, but is generally overruled by Haruhi and ignored by the others. He tries to be really serious, even when narrating, yet he still finds himself coming back to the SOS Brigade headquarters every day. \nHaruhi herself is a bit of a mystery. She starts off quiet and ignores everyone, but when Kyon takes an interest in her, she starts to open up and show her crazy side. She's not afraid to go after what she wants, even when it involves using her friends (mostly Mikiru) as the means to an end. When she doesn't have her way, the world is generally at stake. Kyon is the only one she'll listen to. \nKoizumi is also a great character. He tends to just smile and go along with whatever crazy plans Haruhi has. Nagato is very serious with little personality and no emotions. She never interferes with Haruhi or anyone unless she has to, because she's there to observe. \nMikiru is almost a parody of the usual cute, dumb big busted girl character. She is that character, but she's forced into the fanservice situations by Haruhi, who does it for her own gain. Mikiru is very quiet and shy, and gets embarrassed very easily. She's also naive and really skittish.  She's probably my least favourite character, but still enjoyable. \nIt's hard to imagine anyone not enjoying this series, and is definitely worth the watch! It now ranks among my top anime series! "},

It pokes fun at genres in anime so you know it has to be exceptional to pull that off without looking like a *beep*! Let&rsquo;s give you an overview of the wondrous world of the ASOS brigade :\nPlot: Aliens, Time Travelers, time shifters ,ESpers , and the little normal boy that could.  All characters in the great anime of the melancholy. A young\n          \n        boy is forced to be in a group, the ASOS brigade  with a &ldquo;bizarre&rdquo; girl who &ldquo;HAS NO TIME FOR ORDINARY HUMANS!!!&rdquo; little does she know she&rsquo;s surrounded by &ldquo;humans&rdquo; who are not all that ordinary , or human for that matter. Also, she fails to notice  that she&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t of the ordinary type herself , she&rsquo;s a time shifter/ shaper which means she can do anything she wishes. And thus the story goes. With a plot like this, where can you go wrong! Although the story has never been seen &hellip;EVER , sometimes I feel like they don&rsquo;t know what to do and it gets overrun by the happenings in school life. A lot of the time I feel like The Melancholy is too short , causing you to look at the back of the box to see if you have just seen the last episode. Sadly , there is no character development *tear* but it looks like I the next season we might see some! Okay,  I like the fact that the main character , Haruhi isn&rsquo;t the preppy, whiny voiced , Mary sue lead that we always see in anime. She&rsquo;s flawed , bossy , random  and gets what she wants &hellip; EVEN IF SHE HAS TO PRY IT FROM YOUR DEAD HANDS!! In fact, I wish to be as weird as Haruhi one day! She fleshes out and represents unique schoolgirls all over the world. \nSoundtrack and sound/ animation: To quote fall out boy the animation in M.H.S. is oh so intricate. One scene in particular caught my eye. Episode 11 &ldquo;Live Alive&rdquo; where Haruhi and her quiet storm of a friend Yuki are in a band. Yuki rips the guitar and you could almost swear that a real person is playing! Every scene is glossy and characters hairstlyles are luscious  &hellip; just like we expect!!! Even the backgrounds are filled with funny occurrences. The sound is no exception either. The insert songs have and 70&rsquo;s cop show feel which really adds to the series sense of excitement and adventure. They captured the way things sound so well! During the same episode , Haruhi sings, and it feels intimate , like your actually in the room with her.  Speaking of adventures, Aya Hirano&rsquo;s( excuse the spelling) &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an Adventure.Right? Right?&rdquo; is the perfect theme and fits into the story. Okay , I can&rsquo;t talk about M.H.S without talking about HARE HARE YUKAI!!! We love the song and the dance, faultlessness in the shape of a sonnet  and boogie indeed and is a great reflection of the non- seriousness of the show.\nOverall, Haruhi gets a booty shakin , time traveling  9 &hellip; Right?

I didn't know it is based on a novel when I started watching, but as the story progress you get the feeling as you where reading a book, well this is mostly because our character Kyon narrates through the whole series, and most (if not everything) of what he narrates is basically \"His days living around Haruhi Suzumiya\"'. That's the feel it gives you, we get to know the story of Haruhi but not as viewers of the story itself, but the story through the eyes of his friend and classmate \"Kyon\".\nIn the original airing of the show the\n          \n        order of episodes was \"random\", that's why when it comes to the episodes list, you'll probably find threads such as \"Chronological Order - Broadcast Order\" and even 2009 Re-airing order as well as DVD. Now for this randomness, it maintains certain coherence, as most of the show is mostly episodic, even for the two-episodes mini-story. However if you watch 2006 Broadcast order you'll miss some references here and there, but nothing that spoils the development, and serves for a different experience. Even with that said, I would not recommend start with Adventures of Asahina Mikuru, it doesn't make any sense as episode 1 and made me drop the series once.\nThe story revolves around Haruhi and company in high school where they start a little club with mysterious purposes, not going to spoil anything. The animation is bright and cute, there are some CGI scenes, at least they looked like that to me, the backgrounds specially the streets in the sunset are beautiful. I have no complains for the soundtrack, Aya Hirano did a great job as voice actress, as well as the rest of the cast. The characters are really special for me, the most the supporting ones, each one comes from a different background that at the same time unites them in that time and space as if it was their destiny, but maybe not...\nThis series is not to be taken so seriously being honest, I'm not saying this is bad, I gave it a 9/10, it's great entertainment, you can love it or hate, and is surely a show that still years after maintains its fanbase and will hear about it for years to come.\n        "},

The answer to the question why I could deliberately miss out on such a great series remains unknown to me, let me tell you.\nAs of this moment, I haven't completed the series, so I can't fully judge about the plot and subplots. I can confirm, however, that I have been experiencing a sample of very good story writing, the past few days.\nThe one thing I liked about Azumanga Daioh was its older, calmer art\n          \n        style: no flashy colours or seizing animations but rather in accordance with some older Western cartoons. This is why I skipped on Haruhi originally but also why I was a bit reluctant to effectively start on it. Now that I did, I'm glad I have.\nThe more realistically drawn characters fit in with the more realistically drawn background. I think Haruhi Suzumiya, herself and Kyon look great. Especially Haruhi, whom I could perfectly fall in love with.\nRewinding the first episode on your first run for over 4 times to hear the introduction song \"Bouken Desho, Desho?\" needn't further explanation. The main track is superb as are all the ambient tunes which seem to be inspired by lots of styles, Indian 'Bollywood'-music, Europop and the typical Anime tracks. Sound effects are clear and never seem out of place, which, finally, unifies the visuals and audio to one solid whole bordering perfection.\nEnjoyment is the other side of the coin, the infamous \"Endless Eight\" arc has already made a name for itself, and with \"semi-good\" reason. It is essentially eight time the same episode with subtle cinemato- or photographic differences, small changes in speech and music and some scenes. I am now half-way but from what I have seen from Haruhi's story, I expect the Endless Eight to end in a great climax (or not?)\n\nHaruhi is not really suited for people who don't like anime, I think you need really need to be interested to be able to pick this up and understand it well. But nevertheless, it makes as a great second Anime to watch.\n        "},

All the characters are fine, while some of them are slightly two dimensional and predictable our title character, Haruhi,  and our narrator for the story, a High-school boy named Kyon, are more dynamic and interesting. \nHaruhi is a high school student that wants to be interesting and unique, and as such only wants to be associated with unique individuals. They can't just be any unique person though, they must be uniquely strange. Espers, Aliens,\n          \n        Time Travelers. She has no time for people that don't fit into one of these categories, and isolates herself from the rest of her classmates. \nHowever our Narrator Kyon decides one day to try to make friends with Haruhi. While unsuccessful at first, he does start working up a report with her, and eventually gets her thinking about how she can meet such unique and strange people : They'll start a club. And thus begins the odd relationship between Kyon and Haruhi. Haruhi dragging along Kyon, and later others, along for all her crazy plots and plans.\nThe majority of the story is delivered to us by incredibly dry and dead pan Kyon through Voice Over Narration, and honestly is one of the best parts of the show. His narration is often funny and offers insight into the story that you would not find in a strictly third person perspective show. However while the narration is interesting the story lacks. It never lacks for ideas, but it almost always seems to lack depth. The show will prod and poke at deep and interesting ideas, but never fully dive into them and explore. \nWhile I can forgive the show for only skirting the edges of interesting ideas I can't really forgive it for it's genuinely creepy subtext. Throughout the show you will discover that many of the things that Haruhi has a fascination in not only exist, but refuse to make themselves known to her. Not only that but Haruhi is probably even more unique then the Time Travelers, Espers, and Aliens that she fixates on. But once you find out this information, you realize that the rest of the series carries with it an almost cruel subtext of subjugation for some of the characters. \nThis show is generally regarded as a classic and one of the best. While it is worth watching, I can't give it the high praise that some give it. The story feels like it could go in so many interesting places, but it never goes there. It makes a lot of the episodes feel like filler. If nothing else, you should watch it so hardcore fans will stop pestering you to see it.   \n        "},

It's a short show, so you can get through it quickly. All in all its nice for a change of pace, and enjoyable.\n"},

I watched all the episodes but I had to force myself too. \nThe story is all over the place and doesn't really have a plot other then Haruhi trying to find mysteries and aliens. It didn't really progress anywhere and some of the episodes seemed to be just plain boring. \nThe art and sound were good.\n The characters were...strange. Haruhi herself was a one-woman show. All the characters were not anyone you would meet in your daily life. But I think the\n          \n        characters are what kept me going in the series. I wish that the series would show us some of their background but they don't. \nMy enjoyment was pretty good. If the plot went somewhere it would have been more enjoyable. All I'm saying is that this anime is one which you watch if there is nothing else to do. I would recommend this anime to people who don't get bored easily and expect the unexpected. :)\n        "},

Even though it doesn't seem to be, her behaviour is very funny.\nThere is a love-story in anime, but it's hard to find on same beginning.\nEpisodes are scrabbled as it's told in the end of every episode, but it doesn't seem to mix much in head - each episode tells its own story which almost always is based on Haruhi's ideas - and they are almost always interesting without some long, boring scenes.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    One could only put this anime under the category of fantastic. There was no real and absolute story line in here, but the antics of Haruhi Suzumiya kept things alive and vigorous. Along with the witty and fast paced narration of Kyon, this story is hilarious! All the weird Sci-fi and supernatural items that would be serious in any other anime are comedic and are often taunted by his narration.  Unfortunately the series is out of order and should be watched in the corresponding order 2, 3, 5, 10 , 13, 14, 4, 7, 6, 8, 1, 12, 11, 9.\nOverall 8/10, if only it\n          \n        was longer T_T\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="                          \n    (ORIGINALLY WRITTEN ON 19TH NOVEMBER 2009)\nPLOT: 7.5/10\n Watching the first 3 episodes would make you think that The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya was just another slice of life comedy (like School Rumble, Lucky Star, Ouran High School Host Club, Azumanga Daioh and so on), albeit with an extremely eccentric main character, the titular Haruhi Suzumiya. While I don't want to spoil anything, lets just say that episode 4 and onwards opts for a science fiction kind of theme. While the change between styles feels quite clunky (episode 4, AKA \"The Exposition Episode\" is pretty boring), it is still a comedy at heart, with truly laugh\n          \n        out loud moments (anything to do with the computer club is brilliant). With strong, likeable characters and witty dialogue, the story is more than adequate. \nANIMATION QUALITY: 9/10\nAs expected for a high profile, fairly recent release, the animation is astoundingly pretty, particularly in the opening and closing sequences. The only thing that stops it getting a 10 is the decidedly \"meh\" CGI sequences.\nMUSIC: 8.5/10\nWhile the background music during the show is little more than passable, this is more than made up for by the opening them \"Boken Desho Desho\" and the infamous \"Hare Hare Yukai\", both of which have been posted to the blog. Be warned: these songs are incredibly catchy. You'll be humming the tunes for weeks on end.\nVOICE ACTING: 9.5/10\nBoth the original Japanese and the English dub voice acting is very, very good. Not Cowboy Bebop good, but still very well performed. It loses 0.5 because of the English version of the song \"God knows\" which isn't brilliant, but not English version of Sakura Kiss terrible.\nTHE VERDICT: 8.5/10\nWhile not the best comedy or the best science fiction anime ever, The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya provides a good mix of genres with endlessly quotable characters. While I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction to anime, seasoned otkaus who want something a little different should give it a go. \n        "},

I really don't watch too much animes, I try to watch only those what sounds good - Haruhi Suzumiya no Yuutsu is one of these.\nWhen I read I review it told me its a big art. Hm, I thought it is not a as big masterpiece as Akira or Ghost in the Shell, its a very strange story and the episodes are not in the right order. That is what makes this story more stranger, the episodes are not in the right order. The story from my point of view is\n          \n        nine. Very good series, a school-drama with a 'growing story'. Why it is not a masterpiece? Lots of fanservice and its just for fun - its not for being a legendary anime. The art of anime is not outstanding too, nine point, I'm amazed because Haruhi is a moving girl and the moves really descript all the characters. But its not a new-genaration of anime series so its only 9-point.\nThe sound is usual, I think 8 point, only enjoyable with the anime. The characters are amazing - 10 point, its outstanding. I really enjoyed it, 9 point. Overall, its nine point.\n        "},

It shows how life is viewed from a variation of angles, although not being one that we could apply easily on real life, the story captures a concept we could relate to.\nI think you will find the series strange, the characters a perfect representation of their personalities, and the story something that will give you occasional headaches (and possibly nosebleeds as well).\nBut .. it's a fun watch. Learn to be open when following the episodes because it requires maximum tolerance. XD\n"},

Then I started to branch out and find other anime to watch. I attribute Haruhi to opening up the door to anime to me. \nYes, I knew about anime like DBZ/ Sailor Moon...etc... with the anime wave in the 90s, but Haruhi got me seriously into it as an adult. \nSome of the elements that blew me away: I love the character of Kyon and Yuki. I thought Yuki's quite demeanor was so cute. I loved Kyon and how he had such a nonchalant attitude\n          \n        to all of the crazy crap that would happen. Some of the episodes were better than others, but I loved them all for different reasons. \nSeriously, give this anime a try. \nThe spinoff with Yuki was also very good, but it didn't go anywhere. Its OK to try something different and take risks with anime. If you don't, it will just be a rehash of everything we have seen before. \nThe second season was also very good. Of course the endless 8 was a total nightmare, but other than that, it was fine. Why would anyone actually do that?\nThe movie was a gem. \nI really enjoyed the supernatural angle they were taking on this series. I wish they would have stayed with that instead of making it more mundane.\nStill a very solid anime. Watch it!"},

We have manga, some of which is being translated, two seasons with English dubs, a movie that will soon be translated, and ONAs. Basically, Haruhi wants to meet people out of the ordinary and 'hang out' with them. More like abuse them. Have you seen the misery Mikuru's gone through? Anyway, a great anime with a pretty good second season. The main way, in my opinion, this show got its fame is the creativity of the plot. It's just fantastic. And Haruhi...well...let's just say\n          \n        Kyon would rather have Mikuru. Haruhi Suzumiya is a bizarre type, enjoying the subnatural. The series basically flows with Kyon and his friends doing some stuff that'll keep Haruhi interested with life. What happens when she loses interest? You'll have to watch it to find that out. So the story I would give a ten. The art was your average anime art, nothing out of the ordinary. But that's what makes it likeable. Art gets a seven. Sound...in my opinion, the voicing needed a bit of work and the sound effects weren't too much. The main thing I hated was Kyon's Japanese voice, which made it sound like he was interested in all this stuff. Kyon's a pretty lazy and emotionless guy, and the English voice at least took this into account. I'm giving this a 7. Character gets a 10 for reasons I already explained. Overall score is an eight. \n        "},

Your views may vary.)\nThis anime changed my life. I don't know how, but it just did. If you think your life has no meaning, or you're sad, or just want to see radically different ways of living in one scenario, watch it (unless you easily compare things to the real world, then don't)\nStory: 9. Nagaru Tanigawa did a great job writing the novels, and KyoAni did a great job making it an anime.\nArt: 9. KyoAni, you showed a prime example of how to do anime the right way.\nSound: 9. My only\n          \n        three words for this are \"Hare. Hare. Yukai.\" The opening song was great as well, though. And God Knows!\nCharacter: 9. The main 6 episodes told you everything about the characters, or at least made you think so. The remaining episodes told you more and more, step by step.\nEnjoyment: 9. I enjoyed almost every second of it.\nOverall: 15498. I mean... 9. Whoops ^^;\n        "},
